slayings of 12 people at his ranch near agua prieta mexico will 
accept deportation to mexico his attorney said thursday 
hector fragoso burqueno accused of murder and other charges in 
mexico agreed to the deportation thursday provided his us 
citizenship application remains valid attorney alfred s donau iii 
said following a hearing before immigration judge john mccarrick 
donau said the effect of thursdays deal was to preserve 
fragosos right to pursue his citizenship application and at the 
same time set a date when he would be voluntarily returning to 
mexico 
the tucson lawyer said fragoso wouldnt return to mexico at least 
until oct 1 because he needs additional time to complete the 
application process however donau also said he doesnt expect the 
application to be succesful until the charges in mexico are resolved 
fragoso is entitled to citizenship donau said because he is a 
us army veteran 
fragoso had sought political asylum but that request was 
withdrawn after mccarrick refused to bar reporters from the 
courtroom 
donau said his witnesses consequently refused to testify if 
their testimony would be made known to the public at large

legal counsel before facing mexicos charges of firstdegree murder

islanders say there is a curse on 
this mysterious 700 yearold ruined city they know as the reef of 
heaven 
the curse is so strong they say that no one will stay overnight 
no way the last person who stayed there was a german governor 
about 100 years ago said bermin f wellbacher director of 
tourism and natural resources for pohnpei site of the city and one 
of the three island states that make up the federated states of 
micronesia he was found mysteriously dead the next morning you 
wouldnt catch me there no way 
but wellbacher is more than happy for tourists to come in daytime 
to see a stone megalith that is one of the wonders of the pacific 
it is the prime tourist attraction of this impoverished remote 
island 2485 miles west of honolulu 
few people know about nan mahdol no one has fully explained how 
it was built or who built it 
most pacific islands never had a stone age but at nan mahdol the 
walls are made of stone blocks that weight up to 50 tons 
archaeologists believe the stones came from another island and 
brought to the site on rafts but how laborers were able to lift 
them remains a mystery 
it takes an hour by fast boat across a lagoon to reach the city 
at low tide visitors must wade through a sea grass swamp and climb 
slippery rocks to the dark grey mosscovered walls of the ruin 
nan mahdol is a canal city built on 92 artificial islands 15 
miles from kolonia the capital of pohnpei 
built near the passage through the coral reef into the lagoon it 
covers 160 acres huge walls of basalt rock up to 20 feet high 
enclose a deserted city with burial chambers vaults made of giant 
stone slabs and pathways of crushed coral 
scientists believe an advanced civilization built a seawall a 
priestly burial place and adminstrative center servants quarters 
a ceremonial center a coconutoil processing area and a 
communications center where messages were sent by beating log drums 
carbon dating of the ruins indicates the city was built between 
the years 1285 and 1485 recent underwater archaeology suggests it 
might be even older 
legend also says nan madol was created by magicians who then flew 
off into space 
nowadays people of pohnpei are divided over who owns the city 
the local paramount chief salvadore hadley claims it is his 
the government also claims it 
at stake is who gets the revenues from tourism 
i dont ever want to see the day that a paramount chief and the 
government are fighting one another in court said wellbacher the 
tourism official it goes against all our traditions but it is 
our greatest tourist asset 
last year almost 8000 tourists visited pohnpei a lush volcanic 
island which in turn was ruled by spain germany japan and the 
united states 
it is now the capital of micronesia made up of the islands of 
pohnpei truk and kosrae all formerly part of the usadministered 
united nations trust territory of the pacific islands 
wellbacher wants to build a road to the shoreline near nan mahdol 
to make the trip easier for tourists 
hed like to add a restaurant and souvenir shop 
but no hotel 
no one will stay overnight wellbacher said

for 20 years stories have been told in ethiopia 
about two white children kidnapped or abandoned when they were very 
young a brother and sister have stepped forward claiming to be 
those children nairobi bureau chief reid g miller wrote about the 
two earlier this month and here is a followup report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a young man and woman who may be the 
legendary lost white children of ethiopia say they have a 
sister and they introduced her during a visit to the us embassy 
all three arrived at the embassy last week for an interview with 
consul richard adams in an effort to find their parents 
they say they were taken from a white family about 20 years ago 
by the ethiopian housekeeper whose sister and brotherinlaw raised 
them as members of the oromo tribe the story of two lost white 
children is told in many variations usually involving a kidnapping 
a representative of the international rescue committee in new 
york has come to addis ababa in hopes of taking all three to the 
united states 
we are prepared to arrange transportation care and education 
for them in the states said ron laytner an author and freelance 
journalist from fort lauderdale fla 
laytner and adams say that may be difficult because haile mariam 
gadessa and his sisters tegest and lesa are at least for now 
considered to be ethiopian nationals 
anything we do will be legal said laytner who carried a 
letter from former us ambassador angier biddle duke a committee 
director identifying him as its representative 
the international rescue committee is a nonpartisan agency to 
assist resettle rehabilitate refugees it is supported by 
foundations corporations unions community groups and individual 
contributors 
haile mariam and tegest came to the attention of us officials 
when an ethiopian friend took them to the embassy in june 
in their interview with consul carol l rose who retired earlier 
this month they did not mention their sister lesa fearing for 
her safety they say now 
meeting with the new consul last week the three told essentially 
the same story haile mariam and tegest related to mrs rose through 
an interpreter two months ago 
it was adams first meeting with the young people thought to be 
in their early 20s an associated press reporter was allowed to 
attend the twohour interview 
they say they have no clear recollection of their real parents 
but spoke for the first time of seeing a photo album in the 
grassthatched mud hut that became their home 
pictures in the album showed them as small children with their 
white parents they said haile mariam said fire destroyed the hut 
and photos years ago 
they say they dont know for sure why they were taken to live 
with the tribal couple they believe their father became ill and had 
to be evacauated and that their mother went with him 
mrs rose adams and others think the story of the lost white 
children may have been kept alive by occasional sightings of haile 
mariam and lesa they were kept by the oromo couple and tegest was 
sent to another family as a maid 
the embassy has found no record of the youngsters or their 
parents but adams said a few vague clues arose after their story 
came to light 
adams and an ethiopian lawyer hired by the embassy are trying to 
run down the clues he said one was a tip in a letter mailed from 
addis ababa that the father had been a brewery chemist in addis 
ababa 
as a result of the article people sent cash checks and offers 
of help to the embassy 
initially we discouraged people from sending money because 
unless these people are us citizens we would have no authority to 
set up a trust account for them adams said 
later he said the state department suggested establishing an 
account through someone not connected with the us government 
we would like to try to set up an account through a benign 
person here a missionary or somebody he said there is 
significant interest in this serious interest at the state 
department 
the oromo woman who raised the three recalls her brother bringing 
them to her and denied they were kidnapped but was vague about 
brothers motives she said he died soon afterward 
they were beautiful children very white she told reporters 
through an interpreter at her farm 50 miles from addis ababa she is 
in her 70s and divorced 
although they carry her last name the youngsters bear no 
resemblance to the black woman who raised them their hair is light 
brown to blond their complexions a ruddy bronze 
they tell of a lifetime of physical abuse by their foster father 
and other villagers because of their strange appearance 
adams ended the interview when they became agitated the 
interpreter said they were tired of retelling their story to 
consular officers and reporters without result and frightened by 
the increased hostility of fellow villagers caused by their 
notoriety 
the bbc overseas service broadcast their story in amharic 
ethiopias official language and many ethiopians heard it 
because of what the interpreter said adams took up an office 
collection to rent a small apartment in the capital for a month he 
had the young people resettled and urged them to return to the 
embassy for more conversations 
if only we can jog their memories enough we may be able to 
find further clues to their identities and their parents he said 
just before the meeting with adams ended haile mariam said 
our thought is that if our parents are dead why havent our 
grandparents aunts or uncles come looking for us this is what we 
always think this is what we dont understand

this weeks astonishing protest that joined an

republics was the latest tactic used by local activists to advance 
their demands here are some other snapshots from grassroots 
political life in one soviet baltic republic 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
democracy central here is an ornate 
fourstory building where the fledgling grassroots political 
movement sajudis uses high and lowtech to get its message across 
in the drive for lithuanias independence 
on the third floor college students duplicate political 
statements the old fashioned way by typing with carbon paper the 
copying machine is broken one floor up the sajudis information 
agency uses a new fascimile machine to receive a letter from 
washington signed by members of congress supporting freedom for the 
baltic republics 
the offices of sajudis just over a year old have all the 
trappings of an upstart citizens group struggling with meager 
resources to change the world there arent enough phones chairs or 
desks and the staircase is crumbling but there is no shortage of 
dedication 
dozens of helpers stream through the offices hundreds of people 
stop daily at the newsstand on the ground floor to pick up a copy of 
the sajudis newspaper 
the very existence of the office is an important political 
accomplishment in a country where the government tightly controls 
allotment of buildings phones and copying machines 
the windows look out on vilnius cathedral square where protest 
posters demanding occupiers go home a reference to the soviet 
soldiers who have been stationed in the republic since 1940 and 
freedom for lithuania are displayed around a bell tower

although the drive for independence is gradually gaining 
official ambiguously worded support from the lithuanian communist 
party sometimes activists have to settle for symbolism 
dozens of streets have been desovietized or given back the 
names they had before the red army tanks rolled in in 1940 and made 
lithuania a part of the soviet union 
the street where sajudis headquarters is located lenin prospect 
was recently renamed for gediminas the grand duke of lithuania who 
made vilnius the capital in 1322 
a poster on the wall of sajudis headquarters spells out the word 
perestroika president mikhail s gorbachevs reform drive in 
fading letters a calendar depicts the currency used when lithuania 
was independent from 19181940 independence activists hope the

they are portrayed as bride and groom or as soldiers with blood 
dripping from their mouths and are constant targets of both verbal 
and physical abuse 
mere mention of adolf hitler and josef stalin once struck hatred 
loathing or fear into the hearts of millions but in the baltics 
the two dictators are now openly ridiculed 
attacking hitler is certainly not new in the soviet union and 
stalin is now officially vilified for repressing millions of 
people and setting up the tight centrally commanded economy that 
gorbachev is trying to streamline 
but the open accusation that stalin was in cahoots with hitler is 
relatively new 
for the first time we pondered and publicly announced that 
stalin and hitler were branches of the same tree and their policy 
was equally disastrous for our small lithuania the vilnius 
communist party newspaper vecherniye novosti evening news said 
wednesday 
the most dramatic attack on the men who engineered the carving up 
of lithuania estonia and latvia in a secret 1939 agreement was 
their burning in effigy wednesday members of the lithuanian liberty 
league a radical group that demands lithuania secede from the 
soviet union carried a hitlerstalin twoheaded soldier through 
downtown vilnius on the anniversary of the secret deal 
the effigy was carried to an independence rally in a park where 
a speaker said the two dictators drank from one glass the blood of 
lithuania to wind up the demonstration the effigy was burned 
orange flames quickly engulfed it sending black smoke and ashes 
aloft the dictators heads and their bloodsmeared mouths were the 
last to go up in smoke

a state law that would have barred the 
sale or rental of violent videotapes to children was blocked 
thursday by a federal judge who said the measure might clash with 
the right of free speech 
under the law signed june 20 by gov john ashcroft video 
retailers could be fined as much as 200 for renting or selling 
socalled slasher films to children under age 17 the law was 
to take effect monday 
the gray areas are the important ones in this case arent 
they said us district judge b brook bartlett because thats 
where a prosecutor and store owner could have a difference of 
opinion that could get the store owner in trouble 
the measure which would also apply to videos considered 
pornographic under missouri law would require stores to maintain 
separate display areas for violent films 
video industry groups and retailers challenged the law with a 
class action lawsuit and sought the temporary restraining order 
arguing that the law would force video store owners to decide by 
monday which videos fell under the law 
the lawsuit names attorney general william webster and cole 
county prosecutor richard callahan contends the law violates 
constitutional rights of free expression equal protection and due 
process of law 
the missouri law restricts videos that based on contemporary 
community standards would be interpreted by the average person to 
have a tendency to cater or appeal to morbid interest in 
violence for persons under 17 that depict violence that is 
patently offensive and lack serious literary artistic 
political or scientific value 
the lawsuit said the law would require video retailers to limit 
sale and rental of videos that are not obscene and not 
constitutionally subject to restriction under state or federal law 
the lawsuit said terms such as violence and morbid have 
no certain meaning it also criticized the law for applying 
arbitrarily to videos only and not to identical expression in 
television movie theaters and magazines 
the lawsuit was filed by the video software dealers association 
the missouri retailers association the missouri grocers association 
and the motion picture association of america and two retailers 
video express inc of kansas city and baileys cc enterprises inc

a hormone that may play a key role in 
developing the most common form of diabetes has been discovered by 
university of minnesota and swedish researchers 
the hormone islet amyloid polypeptide or iapp appears to 
impair the ability of insulin to regulate the level of sugar in the 
blood causing the development of type 2 or adultonset diabetes 
the researchers said in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
iapp and insulin are secreted by the islet cells in the tail of 
the pancreas the researchers said 
with the discovery the researchers hope to find better ways to 
treat type 2 diabetes which affects an estimated 10 million 
americans and often leads to blindness nerve and kidney damage and 
amputations as the result of gangrene of the feet 
the researchers are drs kenneth h johnson and timothy obrien 
who are university of minnesota veterinary pathologists and drs 
per westermark and christer betsholtz swedish diabetes researchers 
johnson and westermark first mentioned their discovery of the 
hormone in the 1987 proceedings of the national academy of science 
subject to official confirmation by other laboratories 
johnson said wednesday that other researchers quickly replicated 
the findings 
the hormone was isolated from amyloid a protein often found 
around degenerating human and animal tissue johnson said the 
researchers found amyloid in microscopic quantities surrounding the 
insulinsecreting islet cells of pancreases of diabetic humans and 
cats 
he said the amyloid tissue around the pancreases of diabetics was 
reported in the early 1900s but that researchers were puzzled about 
its role for more than 80 years because amyloid also was found 
around the pancreases of people who were not diabetic 
johnson began looking at the amyloid of diabetic cats 20 years 
ago and 12 years ago he and westermark who worked with human 
cadaver pancreases began collaborating 
they found there were differences between the amyloid of 
diabetics and the amyloid of nondiabetics 
three years ago johnson and westermark were able to purify iapp 
from the amyloid surrounding insulinsecreting cells 
iapp like insulin is produced by normal pancreatic cells but 
obrien said the researchers have evidence that an excessive amount 
is produced in adultonset diabetics 
it is likely that iapp is just one of many hormones secreted by 
the islet cells of the pancreas involved in balancing the level of 
blood sugar he said 
weve found iapp in virtually every species we have looked at 
humans dogs cats guinea pigs obrien said presumably it has 
an important role in healthy normal people

mr speaker high chamber 
i want to form a government capable of acting for the good of 
society the nation and the state today such a task can be 
undertaken only by a government open for cooperation of all forces 
represented in parliament and based on new political principles 
the history of our country is accelerating it has happened due 
to a society which does not agree to continuing life as it has been 
until now 
one has to return to poland the mechanisms of normal political 
life the transition is difficult but it does not have to cause 
shaking on the contrary it will be a path to normalcy the 
principle of struggle which sooner or later leads to elimination of 
ones opponent must be replaced by a principle of partnership 
we will not pass from the totalitarian system to democratic one 
in any other way 
the current philosophy of the state must be changed it cannot 
take care of everything and guarantee everything it should 
facilitate and regulate activities the most important role for the 
government and administration at this moment is opening 
possibilities for common actions and individual actions 
i want to be the prime minister of all poles regardless of their 
views and convictions which must not be a criterion for dividing 
citizens into categories 
i will undertake efforts so that the principles of constructing 
the government will be clear to all i am especially obliged to do 
that for solidarity 
helpful will be the understanding of the church which has always 
stood in defense of human rights and has felt the worries of the 
nation as its own the church was and is a stabilizing force in 
poland 
the future government must be truthful to society it must also 
create mechanisms which will allow it to hear the voice of public 
opinion we will pass certain problems to its judgment 
if sacrifices are necessary all must know their sense 
understand them and be able to express their opinions on the 
problems occurring 
high chamber 
the most important issue for society is the condition of the 
national economy which now has to be considered critical 
how bad it is and why already everything has been said about 
it the problem is how to get out of it 
i am fully aware of the great effort that repairing the economy 
will require of the new government and everybody 
the longterm strategic goal of governments activities will be 
restoring to poland economic institutions long known and tested i 
understand by this a return to a marketoriented economy and a role 
for the state similar to that in economically developed countries 
poland cannot afford ideological experiments any longer 
any changes on which the nations prospects and citizens 
welfare depend are blocked today by inflation and the lack of an 
economic balance manifested by poor market supplies and queues a 
state budget deficit and an unbalanced balance of payments 
restoring equilibrium and stifling inflation is a task of utmost 
economic importance as well as political and social significance 
disequilibrium and inflation increasing social tensions can 
undermine the polish march to freedom with high inflation there can 
be no discussion about creating normal working conditions for the 
nation on which its material existence mainly will depend 
the government sensing an absolute and urgent need to challenge 
inflation will prepare a package of required measures utilizing 
what has been tried so far in poland and in other countries as well 
as by referring to the experience of international experts and 
financial organizations 
we will start without delay demonopolizing the structures serving 
the food market the excessive growth of which is one of the causes 
of high prices and halting rural development 
struggling with inflation and restoring market balance has always 
and everywhere been risky for government and painful for society 
keeping in mind the effectivness of the antiinflation operation 
the government will do everything to make it as painless as 
possible one cannot promise however that it will not be felt at 
all nobody responsibly can make such an offer 
poles themselves have to solve polish problems our own 
ingenuity work and patience our own effort will determine our 
success 
this does not mean that we are doomed to be alone in this 
difficult undertaking the world is watching the transformations 
taking place here with sympathy and hope the government will aim 
energetically at obtaining as much economic support for poland from 
the international community as possible in all possible forms 
according to existing procedures and customs 
we will not apply for privileges denied others in a similar 
situation to ours we will however expect the maximum possible 
support of our efforts to cure the economy governments by 
themselves do not create economic success for their nations and do 
not alone end economic crises 
many a government by stifling the initiative of citizens and 
trying to direct everyone and everything effectively overpowered the 
country economically however there have been and there are 
governments that release the economic energy dormant in talented and 
diligent people

designated driver of the van she took each day from ontario about 
35 miles east of downtown 
he eyed her in the rearview mirror for about a month before he 
got the nerve to ask her out on a date three years later they were

how about this name on a college

it was one of several offered this week as yuba college district 
trustees discussed changing the districts name 
we cover a large geographical area said patricia wirth the

not necessarily describe the district 
trustee fred mathews offered yosubacola in jest using two 
letters from each of five counties the district covers yolo 
sutter yuba colusa and lake the district also includes parts of 
butte glenn and placer counties 
mathews said he offered the name because he was scared to death

it may not help you in your next trivial 
pursuit game but here are some facts about voyager churned out by 
the national aeronautics and space administrations public relations 
people 
the voyager mission has cost each us resident 20 cents a year 
since the project began in 1972 that totals 865 million 
the two voyager spacecraft have sent back 5 trillion bits of 
scientific data enough to fill 6000 complete sets of the 
encyclopedia brittanica 
each voyager spacecraft has as many electronic components as 
2000 color televisions 
the power it takes to operate a digital wristwatch is 20 
billion times greater than the power of the voyager radio signals 
reaching earth 
an unprotected human riding on voyager 1 would have received a 
radiation dose 1000 times the lethal level while passing jupiter 
the voyager project has consumed 11000 work years onethird 
what it took to build the great pyramid at giza 
each voyager spacecraft has a slight roll that engineers cannot 
control the roll is 15 times slower than the motion of a clocks 
hour hand 
when the voyager spacecraft swept past jupiter they got an 
energy boost and jupiter suffered an energy loss enough to slow its 
motion by one foot in the next trillion years 
voyager gets 30000 miles to the gallon 
pele the largest volcano on jupiters moon io spews sulfur to 
a height 30 times that of mount everest and the fallout covers an 
area the size of france 
the voyager spacecraft will leave the solar system in 20000 
years at which time they will have traveled half the distance to

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki a symbol 
of the astounding change in the communist world has emerged as a 
cautious conciliatory negotiator who admits he is frightened by the 
challenge ahead 
a lot of things terrify me he said as he paused after his 
nomination last week to contemplate his momentous mission 
the first noncommunist prime minister to head an east bloc 
government mazowiecki faces awesome responsibility 
he must negotiate the competing demands of factions long at 
ideological odds while confronting economic disaster and inspiring a 
populace that has exhausted its faith in government of any stripe 
at first i felt as if someone had put 100 kilos of stones on my 
head mazowiecki said but i calmed down and started looking 
with a certain optimism otherwise i could not take on this role 
mazowiecki was proposed as the head of a governing coalition by 
solidarity leader lech walesa for whom mazowiecki has been a close 
adviser since the founding of the independent union during shipyard 
strikes in 1980 
the 62yearold lawyer and journalist a lifelong anticommunist 
with close ties to the roman catholic church was not among the most 
public solidarity leaders nothing could have prepared him for the 
hopes now centered on him 
he has responded with remarkable calm there have been no fiery 
speeches nor radical announcements his diplomacy may smooth the 
delicate transition or it may disappoint those waiting to be 
ignited 
although his demeanor has been mild those who know him say he 
can be tough 
mazowieckis solidarity activism earned him a year in prison 
after the martiallaw crackdown imposed in 1981 by wojciech 
jaruzelski the communist president who nominated him as prime 
minister saturday 
but associates say he was not embittered his approach to the 
weakened but still crucial communist party so far has been to play 
down differences and offer compromise there has been little sense 
of triumph 
i think we should be mutually open to each other and aim at a 
situation where no reluctance and aggression take place between us 
because what poland needs now is a joint effort of all forces he 
said after hearing of a sharply worded resolution from the party 
to the polish people he has offered a mix of hope and realism 
asking them to believe that it can be better in this country 
while acknowledging society has no concept how difficult it will 
be to reform this economy 
graying and dignified mazowiecki appears solemn serious and 
even cool but he has shown humor and a human side during the tense 
week joking about running out of gas while driving not fitting 
for a premier and craving a cigarette away from the cameras 
the widowed father of three sons who has four grandchildren 
mazowiecki was editing solidaritys weekly newspaper when history 
turned to him he had founded the newspaper during the unions first 
legal months in 1980 and resurrected it when solidarity was 
legalized again in april 
walesa had entrusted him with a major role in the negotiations 
between the opposition and the communist authorities that led to 
restoration of solidaritys legal status and the freest parliament 
elections in postwar poland he was in charge of the talks on trade 
union issues 
this spring mazowiecki chose to remain an editor rather than run 
for the national assembly 
he had been a sejm deputy from 1961 to 1970 as a member of znak 
an officially condoned delegation under the churchs protection that 
supported regeneration of poland based on catholic values 
in 1971 when he tried unsuccessfully to establish a sejm 
commission to study the violent repression of strikes that swept the 
baltic coast following price increases in december 1970 he 
overstepped official tolerance and was denied another term 
born april 18 1927 to an intelligentsia family in the small 
central poland city of plock mazowiecki attended warsaw university 
by age 21 in the early years of communist poland he was dismissed 
from his academic editing house job for links too close to the 
church 
he began to work for pax set up by the government to dilute 
churchbased opposition but one of the few venues for independent 
thought by 1955 he had been dismissed for criticizing the mix of 
politics and religion 
in 1958 he founded the wiez or link a progressive catholic 
monthly magazine that he edited until 1981 
the warsaw club of catholic intelligentsia he helped found in 
1957 became the core of the catholic fight against to communist 
ideology 
on aug 22 1980 he arrived at the strikebound lenin shipyard 
and after a nightlong session with walesa he took charge of a group 
of experts advising the workers on organizing the union 
he stayed with walesa and the movement through seven years of 
resistance 
in the council of minister building during his first hours as 
prime minister he recalled walking out of the lenin shipyard with 
workers in disappoinment after an unfruitful occupation strike in 
may 1988 
i think that neither them nor i thought that exit would lead to 
my entrance here today he said

researchers who isolated the gene that causes 
cystic fibrosis say the discovery may lead to breakthrough therapy 
within the lifetimes of young people now suffering from the disease 
this is a milestone of the highest order but it does not have 
applications for the doctors office tomorrow said dr francis 
collins a codiscoverer of the cystic fibrosis gene 
dr jack riordan director of the cf research program at the 
hospital for sick children research institute in toronto said that 
finding the gene means that within the lifetime of cf sufferers 
we can now say its possible that drugs will be discovered to 
treat the fundamental condition causing the disease 
collins of the howard hughes medical institute and the 
university of michigan in ann arbor mich riordan and lapchee 
tsui also of the toronto research institute announced thursday 
they had isolated the gene responsible for cf 
in cooperative research at labs in michigan and toronto they 
also discovered a mutation in the gene that causes production of a 
defective protein that leads to symptoms of the disease 
a report of their finding is to be published in the sept 8 
edition of science the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science 
robert k dresing president of the cystic fibrosis foundation 
and father of robbie a 22yearold with cf said the discovery 
gives a burst of hope for treatment of a disease that has been 
largely untreatable 
now i can look in robbies eyes and say we going to cure this 
disease and you will be a beneficiary dresing said at the news 
conference the remark received long applause from a audience that 
included a number of cystic fibrosis patients and their parents 
cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal genetic disease of 
young people in north america afflicting about 30000 the cystic 
fibrosis foundation in bethesda md said that 1000 to 1200 new 
cases usually children are diagnosed annually 
the disease causes the formation of a thick sticky mucus that 
clogs the lungs and digestive tract blocking breathing and 
digestion half of its victims die before their mid20s 
treatment of the disease has been symptomatic with drugs and 
therapy designed to control the thick mucus and to help patients 
avoid or combat repeated lung infections that often kill 
collins said treating the specific cause of the disease was 
caught in a bottleneck because the precise gene and the flaw 
that caused the disease were not known 
that bottleneck has been passed through now he said at a 
news conference on thursday 
first use of the new knowledge said collins will be to develop 
a screening test to identify the 12 million or so americans who 
unknowingly carry the defective gene and can pass it along to their 
offspring he said about 5 percent of the white population are 
carriers of the gene 
cf occurs in a child only if it inherits two defective genes one 
from each parent the parents can each carry one defective gene and 
remain healthy but there is a 25 percent chance that a child from 
the couple will have cf 
collins said a genetic test could be developed to help couples 
determine if their children were at risk of inheriting the cf gene 
its going to be possible and very soon he said 
riordan said the researchers found a specific mutation in 70 
percent of the chromosomes carrying the cf gene this flaw he said 
caused the gene to create a protein that lacks an amino acid called 
phenylalanine 
the flawed protein now called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
regulator somehow distorts the transport of charged particles 
across the cell membranes of some organs this in turn plays a 
role in formation of the thick mucus 
riordan said the researchers now must determine the gene mutation 
that causes the other 30 percent of cfrelated problems 
once this is understood he said researchers may be able to 
develop a therapy perhaps some type of protein replacement that 
will correct the flawed mucus secretion 
ultimately collins said the discovery of the defective gene may 
help researchers correct the genetic flaw itself this would mean 
permanently fixing the defect within the gene so that it would start 
producing the correct protein genes are segments within the 
threadlike structures called chromosomes the cf gene was found on 
what is called chromosome 7 
a gene therapy will take quite a bit of time to develop 
said collins that is a path that has never been trod before for 
any disease

the state department is advising its diplomats 
that while they neednt splurge on their wardrobe for overseas duty 
shoes are a must 
american women going abroad as diplomats or their spouses are 
also advised to remove their gloves while eating or drinking at a 
formal function 
this is some of the advice in a pamphlet entitled social usage 
abroad given to us representatives to help prepare them for 
foreign postings 
the leaflet illustrates how protocol that french invention which 
greases the wheels of statehood can be a us diplomats biggest 
nightmare it also makes clear that proper behavior within the us 
diplomatic community abroad is just as tricky as behavior toward 
officials of the host country 
the diplomats training begins well before departure from 
washington it is customary when assigned to a us mission abroad 
to write to the principal officer usually the ambassador to 
express personal pleasure in the assignment the guide advises 
wives or husbands of diplomats should do the same to the wife or 
husband of the principal officer 
a new member of the embassy staff must call on the ambassador or 
chief officer within two working days according to the manual 
an expensive or extensive wardrobe is not necessary for 
junior diplomats it is advisable however for newcomers to bring 
along a basic wardrobe including shoes because they will often be 
too busy on arrival to shop for new clothes 
as for the dress code for a daytime ceremony a womans 
shoulders should be covered and in countries where gloves are 
worn for all daytime social occasions it is useful to remember 
that they are always removed entirely for eating or drinking 
ambassadors in addition to familiarizing themselves with 
treaties and other aspects of bilateral relations must remember to 
take the place closest to the curbside when entering a car 
when making social calls on officials of the host country in 
their homes the americans calling card is left on a hall table 
and a caller should stay no longer than 20 minutes unless strongly 
urged the pamphlet doesnt explain how to judge whether such 
entreaties are strong 
what it does do is answer every question ever put to us said 
nancy forbord relocation adviser for the overseas briefing center 
the center run by the state departments foreign service institute 
provides extensive reading materials on conditions in foreign 
countries regulations of the us foreign service etiquette 
educational and health facilities and other information 
some 14000 people or about half of the americans sent abroad 
last year by various government agencies used the center in 1988 
she said the center also offers a mandatory twoday seminar on 
security overseas and even a course designed to help teenagers 
adjust to life abroad forbord said 
for american hostesses abroad the pitfalls are numerous making 
a dinner table seating plan is full of complexities warn the 
authors of the pamphlet hostesses should check with the embassy 
protocol officer to ensure they have not inadvertently planned to 
seat together people from countries which do not maintain diplomatic 
relations for example 
a proper seating arrangement requires mathematical talent to 
seat eight 12 16 or 20 persons without two men or two women 
sitting together the hostess sits to the left of the seat that is 
properly hers is that clear 
now if the women are served before the men the woman on the 
hosts right is served first and the woman on the hosts left is 
served second try explaining that to the servants 
one also should be aware that an invitation for 8 oclock doesnt 
necessarily mean you show up at 8 in some countries its a signal 
to turn up at 930 
at official dinners in certain commonwealth countries it is 
rude to smoke at the table before the toast to the queen and 
speaking of toasts it is a good idea to leave enough wine in the 
glass at the end of the meal to join in the drinking of such 
salutations 
and in case your parents neglected to tell you the guide advises 
that before leaving each guest should thank those hosting the 
party 
then there are ambiguities for instance men always rise when 
being introduced and when a woman enters the room but whether a 
woman rises to be introduced to another woman is a more complicated 
question depending on age social position etc the guide 
however doesnt advise whether a woman should rise when being 
introduced to a man emily post help

its a quintessentially south 
african paradox johannesburg girls high school has been ordered 
closed for lack of pupils yet its neighborhood abounds with 
schoolgirls who wish they could enroll 
throughout its 102year existence the innercity school has been 
open only to whites now with closure imminent because of white 
flight to the suburbs its students teachers and parents are 
petitioning for it to become south africas first multiracial 
governmentrun school 
we should prove to the rest of the world we can do it said 
candice bond a 15yearold student excited by the idea of black 
classmates our school should feel privileged if it could be the 
first 
the government has given no sign it will be swayed by the save 
our school campaign even though organizers say they have gathered 
12000 signatures supporting integration at the citys oldest high 
school 
but sharon bond mother of candice and chairman of the campaign 
says she hopes that mounting pressure might prompt the government to 
reconsider its decision to close the school in december 
on a brick wall at the school was a poster with the initials 
sos for save our school and a crayon drawing showing a 
white girl and black girl side by side dressed in the schools 
uniform 
the school was built to accommodate 630 students and now has 
203 it is in the heart of the countrys largest gray area 
where thousands of black and indian families have moved in defiance 
of residential segregation laws 
acting president fw de klerk favored to win a full fiveyear 
term after the sept 6 parliamentary elections says he opposes 
discrimination and favors legalization of selected multiracial 
neighborhoods but he has recommitted himself to the concept of 
segregated public schools 
asked about johannesburg girls high school he said children 
should have mothertongue education among people of their own 
community 
parents who wanted multiracial education could send their 
children to integrated statesubsidized private schools de klerk 
said 
but mrs bond said most girls at the high school were from 
lowincome or singleparent families and could not afford the cost 
of private schools 
the parentelected management council at johannesburg girls high 
has been criticized by some parents for failing to consult the 
school community fully before it advised the government to either 
integrate the facility or close it 
but council chairman jack foster said the declining enrollment 
left no other option 
it wasnt educationally viable anymore he said we 
couldnt offer the variety of subjects you need in a high school 
like that 
its a great great pity he added the facilities are all 
there it seems crazy not to utilize them 
the school is a spacious complex of modern redbrick buildings on 
the border of hillbrow and berea two neighborhoods dominated by 
highrise apartment buildings they officially are designated as 
whites only but an estimated 60000 blacks indians and people 
of mixed race have moved in and the government has virtually halted 
enforcement of residential segregation laws in the area 
however no state schools have been established for these 
nonwhite families their children must either go to costly private 
schools or commute long distances to crowded poorly equipped public 
schools in outlying townships 
mrs bond said some black children spend nearly four hours daily 
commuting to and from schools in soweto southwest of johannesburg 
if it closes johannesburg girls high could be the first of many 
a new study by education specialists at johannesburgs university of 
the witwatwersrand said 42 of the citys 175 white schools are at 
risk of closure within five years because of declining enrollments 
the study calculated that there were 13150 vacant places for 
students in the citys schools

a painreliever that causes laboratory monkeys 
to lose interest in cocaine may now be tested to see if it can help 
human addicts lose the craving for drugs researchers say in an 
article published today 
researchers at a harvard medical school drug abuse research 
center report that five rhesus monkeys that had been dosing 
themselves regularly with cocaine chose to ignore the drug after 
receiving injections of buprenorphine the study appears in the 
journal science 
dr jack h mendelson a coinvestigator in the research said as 
a result of the animals response to buprenorphine clinical studies 
are proposed to determine if the analgesic will help people overcome 
dependence on cocaine and heroin 
we feel that it buprenorphine may provide an opportunity for 
some persons to stop using cocaine and not feel the adverse effects 
of cessation mendelson said in a telephone interview this 
would provide a window in time for someone who might be able to stop 
using the drug and ultimately become drugfree 
in the laboratory studies five rhesus monkeys were fitted with 
intravenous catheters that were connected to pumps operated by 
levers each monkey if it chose to could press the lever and 
receive a small dose of cocaine 
the monkeys selfadminister cocaine but are under no 
compulsion to do so mendelson said it is completely an 
elective act 
he said earlier studies showed that when given this choice nine 
out of 10 rhesus monkeys will press the lever for cocaine though 
they will choose not to selfadminister some other types of 
pharmaceuticals 
mendelson said that when the five test monkeys received 
injections of buprenorphine their cocaine use rapidly declined and 
approached zero use at some doses of the buprenorphine 
when a type of placebo saline solution was injected the 
monkeys chose to press the cocaine lever repeatedly 
the placebo didnt do anything mendelson said but the 
buprenorphine suppressed the cocaine selfadministration 
at the same time he said the monkeys continued to press another 
lever to receive banana pellets and otherwise behaved normally 
while taking the buprenorphine 
it doesnt produce the behavior changes and its safety is 
enormous said the researcher 
mendelson said buprenorphine may be particularly useful in 
weaning abusers away from speedball a combination of heroin and 
cocaine that is becoming more widely used by drugdependent people 
weve tried buprenorphine in heroindependent persons and 
most of them report they can detect that theyve had a drug but it 
doesnt produce the degree of euphoria and certainly not the rush of 
a drug like heroin or methadone he said most of the people who 
are heroindependent who have used the drug report that they dont 
feel high but they feel normal 
the factors of drug addiction are highly complex and stopping 
dependence is not easy mendelson said though it appears that 
buprenorphine would not become a substitute addiction for 
cocaine he said it does not represent a magic bullet for the 
effortless control of substance abuse but possibly only an aide for 
controlling such dependence 
some people he noted will abuse chicken soup 
buprenorphine is commonly used in britain for relief of moderate 
pain and is used in us hospitals as an injectable pain reliever 
norwich eaton pharmaceuticals inc markets it as the prescription 
drug buprenex 
the rhesus monkey study was coauthored by mendelson nancy k 
mello mark p bree and scott e lukas all researchers at the 
harvard medical schoolmclean hospital drug abuse research center in 
belmont mass

the joint chiefs of staff have sent the white 
house a list of military hardware that president bush could send to 
colombia if that country seeks such aid in its war against drugs 
sources say 
the joint chiefs met thursday to draw up the list which includes 
uh1 huey troop transport helicopters ammunition and radio 
equipment said a military source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
top us and colombian officials were expected to meet in 
washington to discuss how the two nations can cooperate in the 
antidrug battle 
an administration source who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity stressed that no us military personnel were included in 
the joint chiefs suggestions 
this he said was in line with bushs complaint that talk of 
such an idea had gotten out of whack 
colombian president virgilio barco has also rejected the idea of 
seeking us troops 
the administration official said bush could do other things to 
help colombia in its battle against drug terrorists such as 
offering training to members of the colombian military and police 
forces but he cautioned we arent going to do anything unless 
the colombians say they want it 
the military source said the us helicopters which were widely 
used in the vietnam war and are being replaced by the more 
sophisticated blackhawk choppers must be flown by colombian pilots 
since no us personnel will be involved 
no precise numbers were disclosed but the source said the amount 
of helicopters that could be provided was not extravagant 
the administration source said the list was not a formal 
recommendation but instead provides the president with a laundry 
list of items that the pentagon could provide if called upon to do 
so 
the official said the pentagons suggestions came amid those 
offered by other agencies such as a 2 million justice department 
program designed to help colombia protect judges and other officials 
threatened by the drug cartel 
the military source noted that the joint chiefs list is over and 
above the aid provided to colombia through the foreign military 
sales program 
under the fms program the defense department has sold colombias 
government almost 210 million worth of military goods and services 
since 1963 pentagon officials said thursday 
the focus of the sales have been the helicopters ammunition 
spare parts and support for the choppers 
the colombian government has requested that the exportimport 
bank provide a loan guarantee for approximately 200 million and 
the proceeds of loans obtained under the guarantee would finance 
additional fms purchases for the counternarcotics programs the 
pentagon said 
colombia is expected to purchase additional uh60 and uh1 
helicopters patrol boats rifles machine guns ammunition 
vehicles and spare parts as part of this program the pentagon said 
in the 1988 fiscal year a total of 775 colombian military 
personnel were trained under the international military education 
and training program while 898 colombian military received such 
training so far this fiscal year the pentagon said

amal aruri steeled herself 
for the worst but still found she was unprepared when the israeli 
supreme court ordered her husband deported to lebanon 
we fought it for more a year mrs aruri said her voice 
shaking even though i expected it day by day still i was 
shocked 
the 28yearold palestinian nursery school teacher learned from 
israeli radio news that an appeal by her husband physics professor 
taysir aruri was rejected by the court thursday he is accused of 
being a leader of the palestinian uprising 
the deportation order is expected to be carried out within a week 
and could mean a long separation for the family mrs aruri has no 
passport and fears she will not get special travel passes from the 
israeli military government 
i havent told the children yet she said in an interview 
adding she was waiting until we can sit alone together maybe 
at bedtime 
on thursday the sitting room in the familys white stone house 
was crowded with relatives who came to lend support and distract the 
three aruri children ages 2 to 7 while mrs aruri talked with 
lawyers and reporters 
taysir aruri a 43yearold physicist at the west banks bir zeit 
university was served on aug 17 1988 with a deportation order 
signed by defense minister yitzhak rabin 
he has been jailed since in juneid prison near nablus 
aruri was never tried but was accused by the army of being a 
member of the outlawed palestinian communist party and of being 
involved in planning the intefadeh and a member of the unified 
command of the intefadeh 
intefadeh is the arabic word for the uprising palestinians 
have been waging since december 1987 against israeli occupation of 
the west bank and gaza strip 
the supreme court does not hear arguments in deportation cases 
and only decides if the army acted properly the court has never 
overturned a deportation order 
londonbased amnesty international has adopted aruri as a 
prisoner of conscience and hundreds of scientists in america 
canada and europe signed petitions and launched a letterwriting 
campaign on his behalf 
maybe they didnt know they were dealing with a very cold 
government here mrs aruri said 
her husband was one of four palestinians whose petitions were 
rejected thursday the others are odeh yusef maali and majed labadi 
both union organizers and mohammed matur a teacher labidis 
brother mohammed also a union leader was expelled in june 
the new expulsions to lebanon will raise the number of deportees 
to 59 
the united states the united nations and international human 
rights groups have said repeatedly that the practice violates 
international law 
this was not aruris first runin with israeli authorities he 
was jailed from 1974 to 1978 without charge or trial under israeli 
administrative detention procedures then too he was championed by 
amnesty international 
asked about the allegation that her husband is a leader of the 
uprising mrs aruri said i think every palestinian is a leader 
of the intefadeh it doesnt depend on leaders really since it is 
a popular revolution 
petitions on aruris behalf including one signed by nearly 1000 
foreign scientists and published in the englishlanguage jerusalem 
post in may describe him as a man of peace 
an outspoken critic of the occupation aruri has urged an 
international conference leading to creation of a separate 
palestinian state beside israel an idea long opposed by israels 
government 
two months before he was arrested aruri joined other prominent 
palestinian and israeli artists and intellectuals in signing a 
peace treaty calling for dialogue he has argued that there can 
be no military solution to the arabisraeli conflict 
mrs aruri said the couples children knew their father might be 
deported to lebanon 
natasha the 5yearold often asked during weekly prison visits 
about his future can we come to visit you when will you come 
home 
right now i dont have answers for her mrs aruri said

things are so bad for us policy in panama 
that the state department official assigned to that issue lawrence 
eagleburger is being dubbed by irreverent colleagues as the 
deputy secretary for disasters 
eighteen months have passed since the united states began its 
effort to dislodge gen manuel antonio noriega from power but it 
seemed easier to negotiate the departure of 100000 soviet troops 
from afghanistan than it has been to uproot a single panamanian 
elsewhere in the world the picture looks much more promising for 
administration policy the soviet empire for example has shown 
clear signs of unraveling but noriega continues to reign in panama 
smugly defying the wishes of his opponents in washington 
the organization of american states has held four foreign 
ministers meetings on panama secretary of state james a baker iii 
attended the first but assigned the following three to eagleburger 
the state departments secondranking official 
it has been a thankless task 
under heavy us prodding the oas in may held noriega 
responsible for the grave events surrounding national elections 
in which opposition candidates were deprived of an apparent victory 
and then beaten by government agents days later 
the oas statement encouraged us officials but as time passed 
the number of countries willing to take a strong stand against 
noriega steadily diminished 
among others mexico felt that the principles of nonintervention 
should outweigh all other considerations in dealing with internal 
problems in member states 
more than any other country mexico knows the price of foreign 
interventionism having lost half its territory 140 years ago to its 
powerful northern neighbor there was no oas at the time to put a 
brake on us territorial ambitions 
there was not much left of the antinoriega indignation by the 
time the oas ministers convened this week for the fourth time to 
discuss the panama situation 
indeed oas mediators given the task of promoting a democratic 
transfer of power in panama issued a report that left state 
department officials gasping in disbelief 
the report far from criticizing noriega did not even mention 
him by name and instead concluded that the blame for the lack of 
progress rested with none other than the bush administration 
the study said us military maneuvers in panama had a negative 
effect on the negotiating process and were inopportune 
in response the administration acknowledged that the maneuvers 
did indeed take place but were consistent with us treaty 
responsibilities to protect the panama canal 
in private officials expressed incredulity that the mediators 
were unwilling to take a more assertive stance against a strongman 
who they alleged stole an election tramples on the human rights 
of his people and does business with colombian drug dealers and 
leftist guerrillas in that country 
panama has its list of grievances against the united states 
accusing the administration of trifling with panamas sovereign 
rights through a variety of coercive measures including economic 
sanctions as panama sees it us military maneuvers are aimed less 
at protecting the canal than intimidating noriega 
not surprisingly feelings were running high wednesday and early 
thursday morning when the oas foreign ministers assembled to discuss 
the situation 
eagleburger reaching deep into his rhetorical bag likened 
noriega to adolf hitler and said the panamanian runs an outlaw 
regime 
panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter stormed out of the 
meeting hall during eagleburgers presentation leaving a deputy 
romulo escobar betancourt to rebut 
for two hours escobar ranted about us predatory activities and 
challenged eagleburger to prove his allegations about noriegas role 
in drug smuggling 
but eagleburger had long since left his seat and was seen 
stalking the hallway smoking a cigarette his translation device 
nowhere in sight 
it was 230 am and eagleburger had the look of a man who 
wished he were elsewhere

a contra spokesman predicts the state 
department will object to a rebel appeals court decision that 
exonerates a top commander found guilty in march of covering up a 
murder 
the contra court made up of four civilian lawyers living in 
miami also upheld the conviction of one contra commander and 
reduced charges against four others in a torturemurder case rebel 
spokesman bosco matamoros said thursday 
five of the six contras were given dishonorable discharges the 
stiffest penalty that can be handed out by the contra internal court 
system that was set up in 1987 leniency was recommended for one 
according to a document obtained by the associated press 
it could not be independently confirmed if the expulsions were 
carried out 
meanwhile the rebels fired their chief representative in 
washington ernesto palazio charging him with abuses of contra 
funds that matamoros said could run into the hundreds of thousands 
of dollars palazio believed to be in miami could not immediately 
be reached for comment 
a 1986 law prohibits ussupplied aid to any group that includes 
a person found to engage in gross violations of internationally 
recognized human rights 
a state department official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said the appeal would be reviewed 
if they are guilty and maintained in the resistance that 
creates a problem the official said we will review the verdict 
of the appeals tribunal and see what procedures were followed and 
how they arrived at their decision 
matamoros said he expected the state department to object to the 
dismissal of charges that commander mack the chief of intelligence 
for the contras covered up a murder mack was a member of the 
national guard under the late nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza 
mack reportedly violated a state department order that he be 
suspended from his duties until after the appeal 
the contra tribunal found that rebel commander isaac blacker 
hurtado known as israelita had the premeditated intention of 
murdering managua 2 a man who was killed in november 1988 
the victim was suspected of being an agent of nicaraguas 
sandinista government the six contras were charged in march by a 
contra court in connection with the murder and several rapes in 
northern nicaragua the united states pressed for the investigation 
the lawyers upheld charges of torture and cruel and inhuman 
punishment against israelita as well as contras known as rambo 
pandillero ali and nolan the judges recommended leniency for 
nolan saying he joined the contra ranks at age 15 and lost an eye 
in the fight 
the rebels backed by the united states since 1981 have been 
fighting to overthrow the leftist sandinista government in 
nicaragua matamoros said he did not know the whereabouts of the 
expelled commanders but believed they were in nicaragua

electric utilities in the coming decade will 
have to build at least twice as much generating capacity as 
previously planned to meet the nations growing appetite for 
electricity an industry group says 
in an otherwise bright outlook for energy supplies and prices 
the gas research institute said thursday that the northeast will 
face a serious squeeze in electricity 
the likelihood of a shortfall in electric utility generating 
capacity particularly in the near term to the year 2000 and 
through the 1990s is very high said daniel dreyfus the groups 
vice president for strategic planning and analysis 
he said an electricity pinch in new england was now virtually 
unavoidable because demand would outstrip supply before new power 
plants can be built 
even if the nations electricity use grows relatively slowly to 
2000 electric utilities will have to build at least 45 gigawatts of 
new capacity roughly equivalent to 45 new largescale power plants 
beyond the 46 gigawatts of capacity already on the drawing board 
the report said 
the research group sponsored by natural gas pipeline and 
distribution companies also said the big increase in world oil 
prices that many forecasters have projected for the mid1990s is 
unlikely to hit before the turn of the century 
a key reason for expecting a longer period of stable prices it 
said is that oil production in highcost fields such as the north 
sea has remained strong some highcost production has been lost 
particularly in the united states but the overall decline has been 
smaller than expected after the 1986 price crash 
oil prices by 1995 are likely to be about 18 a barrel in current 
dollars rising to about 20 a barrel by 2000 the group said oil 
is selling for about 18 a barrel up from about 15 a barrel last 
year 
a faster price escalation is likely after the turn of the 
century dreyfus said as world oil demand moves closer into balance 
with available supplies the forecast said the price in current 
dollars would be about 32 a barrel in 2010 
low oil prices during the 1990s imply a generally stable price 
for all types of energy including natural gas coal and products 
made from oil such as gasoline the forecast said this is because 
oil is the most versatile and dominant energy source 
the report also said us oil imports would reach 134 million 
barrels a day by 2010 nearly double the current rate and meeting 
about twothirds of total us oil needs

this years lingering drought in major wheat 
areas continues to drain us grain reserves and push up market 
prices the agriculture department says in a new analysis 
moreover the departments economic research service said 
thursday world stockpiles are in similar shape with wheat reserves 
the lowest since the mid1970s 
the analysis was based on the aug 10 estimate that wheat 
production would be about 204 billion bushels up 13 percent from 
the 1988 harvest 
wheat use including exports is expected to be 229 billion 
bushels in the marketing year that began june 1 down 5 percent from 
198889 
with us farm prices expected near the target price 4 per 
bushel in 198990 and increased competitor supplies exports may 
decline more than 10 percent to less than 13 billion bushels the 
report said the us share of world trade is expected to slip as 
well 
at the end of the 198889 wheat marketing year the united states 
had about 694 million bushels from previous harvests in its 
stockpile and this june 1 carryover was down from more than 
126 billion bushels a year earlier 
by next june 1 the report said the wheat stockpile will be 
trimmed further to an estimated 474 million bushels down more than 
30 percent and the smallest carryover since 197475 
most of the reduction will occur in the inventories held by the 
departments commodity credit corp as forfeited collateral for 
price support loans made to producers other reductions will be in 
the farmerowned reserve of wheat stored under loan and released 
to the market as prices rise and the loans become due 
area planted increased 17 percent in response to attractive 
prices and less acreage idled under annual government programs but 
yields are forecast to be the lowest since 1978 because of 
lingering drought in major wheat production areas the report said 
because of the continued tight wheat supply the government has 
lowered the landidling requirement for 1990 to 5 percent of the 
base acreage down from 10 percent for 1989 and 275 percent in 
1988 that is land farmers must take from production to qualify for 
federal supports 
wheat prices are projected to average in the range of 385 to 
425 per bushel in the 198990 marketing year up from 372 
estimated for 198889 
the global wheat situation is similar to the us the report 
said world production is forecast up 265 million tons to 527 
million metric tons in 198990 however consumption is expected to 
outpace production for the third consecutive year reducing stocks 
to their lowest since 197576 
relatively high export prices are expected but world demand 
for imported wheat is likely to remain strong the report said

egg production continues to drop meaning 
higher prices for consumers according the latest agriculture 
department estimates 
july production was 563 billion eggs down 2 percent from a year 
earlier a report said thursday production included 489 billion 
eggs for the table and 738 million for hatching 
as of aug 1 the laying flock was about 2642 million birds 
down 2 percent from a year ago 
however production averaged 681 eggs per 100 birds virtually 
the same as a year earlier the report said 
the departments economic research service says in a related 
report that total egg production this year is expected to decline 
about 2 percent the agency earlier forecast a 3 percent drop but 
net returns continue to be positive and are likely to remain so 
for the rest of the year 
as a result flock rebuilding is expected to bring about a 
largerthanexpected increase in table egg production during the 
fourth quarter the report said 
egg production in the third quarter of this year is expected to 
be only about 1 percent below a year ago and may increase about 1 
percent from a year earlier during the fourth quarter 
wholesale egg prices are up sharply from a year ago and should 
maintain their strength through september before coming down in the 
fourth quarter as supplies increase 
the agency predicts that 1989 consumer prices of eggs will 
average 15 percent to 20 percent higher than in 1988 when prices 
gained 23 percent retail egg prices dropped 59 percent in 1987 
and then began climbing as financially pressed producers cut back on 
flocks 
retail egg prices had increased 69 percent in 1986 after a 166 
percent plummet in 1985

the great amercian kissoff contest in a furniture stores parking 
lot 
gubler an auto body shop foreman and ms bradley who works in 
a retail store said thursday the only thing that worries them about

the couple is trying to accumulate break time for the wedding 
ceremony but if they must theyll just say muffled i dos with

a unanimous federal reserve vote allowing bank 
holding companies to buy healthy thrifts is being described as 
another nail in the coffin of an independent savings and loan 
industry 
still the decision was widely expected after enactment two weeks 
ago of sampl bailout legislation and thrift officials are looking on 
the bright side 
the 60 ruling thursday will bring more money from commercial 
banks into the troubled savings business 
the healthy institutions are happy to have more people 
interested in their stock said dennis j jacobe research 
director of the us league of savings institutions which opposed 
the rule when it was proposed two years ago 
under the federal regulatory scheme banks and savings 
associations were kept strictly separate until 1982 when congress 
decided to allow bank holding companies to buy ailing thrifts 
in september 1987 the fed proposed opening all thrifts to 
purchase by banks but delayed its decision after it ran into a 
barrage of criticism from sampls small banks and members of congress 
when the bush administration originally drafted its sampl bill six 
months ago it had called for a twoyear delay before banks could 
buy healthy sampls on the theory that banks wouldnt want to buy 
ailing thrifts if they had the chance to buy sound institutions 
but congress scrapped the waiting period in an effort to entice 
banks into investing in marginal but still solvent savings 
associations 
james r barth chief economist of the office of thrift 
supervision says solvent sampls will have to raise 30 billion to 
meet new capital requirements going into effect by the end of the 
year 
he estimated that half of the approximately 2600 solvent sampls in 
the nation representing 85 percent of the industrys assets fall 
short of the new standard 
however critics warn that thrifts owned by banks may 
deemphasize home mortgage lending and eventually convert to banks 
this just adds another nail to the coffin of a separate 
thrift industry said diane casey director of regulatory affairs 
for the independent bankers association of america which represents 
community banks 
the independent bankers also complain that the decision is a 
backdoor method of allowing companies such as citicorp the 
nations largest banking company to circumvent state laws that 
protect their banks from outofstate takeovers 
this is going to substantially broaden interstate banking we 
believe that should be a state decision not a federal decision 
casey said 
the fed however says only four states iowa kansas montana 
and north dakota ban interstate banking 
it does have the tendency to accelerate the pace of interstate 
banking said board member john p laware but i think that is 
happening in any case 
james d mclaughlin of the american bankers association which 
had pushed for the change welcomed the fed ruling but quarreled 
with a provision that will prevent bank holding companies from 
acquiring thrift subsidiaries that sell insurance or invest in real 
estate 
those are areas prohibited to banks but not sampl subsidiaries 
theres nothing in here that alters in any way the separation 
of commercial activity and industrial activity from banking said 
board member wayne d angell 
in related action earlier this week the fed lifted socalled 
tandem operating restrictions which had prevented citicorp and 
michigan national corp from fully integrating sampls they owned in 
california illinois and florida into their banking operations

three days ago bradford smith stood 
before 150 reporters squinted into the glare of television lights 
and said hed been wrong 
he pointed to a picture from voyager 2 of one of neptunes 
partial rings or ring arcs 
it seemed reasonable that this was the lost arc that our 
imaging team raiders were looking for he said 
reporters had already said so in their stories and broadcasts 
but the arc that had disappeared from some earlier pictures and 
been rediscovered wasnt an arc at all it goes all the way 
around smith said 
reporters rushed to correct their stories to say that neptunes 
first ring had been found 
now youre going to turn on me right smith said 
he was suffering the perils of what scientists at national 
aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
call instant science 
we have to think on our feet smith said thursday we see 
things in the images and we try to tell you what we think we see 
when the images get better we have to go even faster 
smiths job is complicated by the swift delivery of information 
to the press monitors in the press room at the jet propulsion 
laboratory show reporters raw images from the spacecraft at the same 
time the scientists see them 
when interesting features appear on the television monitors 
reporters want interpretations right away sometimes the scientists 
themselves busy with countless missionrelated chores havent seen 
the latest images often they havent had time to decide what the 
images show 
smiths unhappy experience with the ring occurred at a tuesday 
morning news briefing much the same thing happened to voyager 
scientists again thursday when they stumbled over reports that the 
spacecraft was about to enter neptunes magnetic field 
douglas griffith deputy mission manager told reporters early in 
the day that the spacecraft had crossed a supersonic shock wave 
surrounding neptunes magnetic field and was about to enter the 
field itself 
in fact the spacecraft crossed the shock wave once then the 
shock wave moved and the spacecraft crossed it again griffith said 
two hours later scientists reported that the shock wave had not 
been crossed not until afternoon did voyagers magnetic field team 
pop champagne corks and report that the shock wave had definitely 
been crossed 
its not the fault of the media smith said we understand 
theres a lot of public interest the american people paid for this 
and they want to know what theyre getting for their buck 
the first solid analysis of the voyager data will not appear 
until sometime in january when the socalled 30day report of the 
mission is published in a scientific journal the name comes from a 
time when missions were simple enough that it was possible to 
analyze all the data in 30 days smith said 
even that report coming five months or so after the mission 
will not be final he said voyager science teams will work for 
another year to process most of the remaining data 
other scientists will then take that data and continue for many 
years to come hoping to extract even more information voyager 
passed jupiter in 1979 smith said and people are still 
publishing results from jupiter

newly released documents show that a top hud 
official in the reagan administration removed himself from dealing 
with a boston housing project in 1988 but approved a 51 million 
federal subsidy for it two months later 
please let this memorandum serve as a formal notification of my 
recusal in all matters arising from and pertaining to developer 
arthur d winn thomas t demery who was housing and urban 
development assistant secretary for housing said in july 1988 memo 
about the castle square project in bostons south end 
however demery signed a sept 30 1988 memo announcing a 512 
million grant to the project 
the recusal memo was among demerys files which were opened to 
the media thursday in response to a freedom of information request 
demery now a private consultant is under scrutiny in the probe of 
alleged fraud abuse and mismanagement at hud during the reagan 
years 
demerys files also revealed that he was lobbying in late 1988 to 
be named hud secretary even while he was under investigation by 
huds inspector general 
winn a massachusetts developer who owns the bostonian hotel was 
under contract in 1988 to buy castle square from ronald drucker 
both men contributed to demerys pet charity food for africa 
with winn holding a fundraiser at his hotel according to an 
internal hud investigation released earlier this year 
huds inspector general concluded that demery may have misused 
his position to induce contractors seeking hudsubsidized business 
to contribute to the charity but the justice department said last 
month that it saw no evidence of criminal wrongdoing 
in the memo released thursday demery wrote to huds under 
secretary carl d covitz 
the circumstances leading up to this decision to recuse myself 
are nebulous at best i think i would rather err on the side of 
conservative safety lest any appearance problem unnecessarily 
occur 
demery could not be reached for comment thursday a woman 
answering his phone said he was on vacation 
winn was traveling on business and drucker had gone for the day 
and could not be reached their offices said thursday 
demery is a former michigan real estate agent and mortgage broker 
who worked in ronald reagans 1980 presidential campaign as 
assistant housing secretary he administered several of huds 
biggest programs including 225 million in moderaterehabilitation 
funds awarded annually and the massive federal housing

a federal judge says the energy department must 
award a 1 billion contract for a highlevel nuclear waste dump in 
nevada to a company that sued the agency on the grounds the 
selection process was improper 
us claims court judge reginald gibson in a ruling that has set 
back the governments problemridden nuclear waste program said 
thursday that the department could give the 10year contract only to 
trw inc an unsuccessful bidder that filed the december lawsuit 
the department said it was disappointed about the ruling but 
stressed that the decision did not stop preliminary work to 
determine the sites suitability 
the project has been beset with delays and political squabbles 
stemming in part from nevadas objection to being chosen as the site 
for the waste dump scheduled to begin receiving radioactive cargo 
in 2003 
larry henry press secretary for nevada gov bob miller said the 
court ruling severely weakens the does credibility and 
underscores the states contention that the project has been guided 
by politics not science 
the proposed site at yucca mountain is about 100 miles northwest 
of las vegas 
construction has not begun and energy secretary james d watkins 
has been pressing to begin geologic studies to determine whether the 
site would qualify 
leo duffy watkins chief aide on waste issues said last month 
that the department cant afford to start from scratch in 
soliciting bids for the contract 
gibsons opinion was not immediately made public but the gist of 
the decision without explanation was contained in a brief 
memorandum to the parties in the suit 
gibson said the opinion would be kept secret until wednesday to 
allow the companies involved to review the document for proprietary 
information or trade secrets that should not be made public 
at issue is a charge by clevelandbased trw that energy 
department officials involved in selecting bechtel systems 
management inc in 1988 were guilty of a conflict of interest 
trws contention centered on the fact that samuel rousso who had 
a hand in selecting bechtel had worked for science applications 
international corp a subcontractor to bechtel rousso is director 
of the does office of civilian radioactive waste management which 
runs the project 
under federal law doe supervisors cant participate in any 
projects that involve any energy concern for which they worked for 
up to one year after leaving that company 
department spokeswoman ginger king said rousso was not available 
for comment thursday 
bechtel spokesman rick laubscher said from san francisco that 
company officials were very disappointed in the ruling but 
hadnt seen the opinion or conferred with the doe 
we have to do those things before we can speak knowledgeably on 
the matter laubscher said 
spokesmen at trws cleveland and washington dc offices were 
not available for comment

the food and drug administration is considering 
changes in how it handles generic drug applications as the result of 
a report that said some companies got preferential treatment 
the report issued by the inspector general of the department of 
health and human services confirms that there are serious 
weaknesses in fdas generic drug review process said rep thomas 
j bliley jr of virginia the senior republican on the house 
subcommittee investigating the generic drug industry 
the problems are not isolated as some in the agency originally 
contended bliley said the report indicates that the approval 
process itself needs to be changed we will pursue corrective 
legislation on a bipartisan basis at the conclusion of the 
subcommittees investigation 
subcommittee chairman john dingell dmich requested the 
report which found that weaknesses in the internal control 
structure of this assignment process allowed preferential treatment 
to drug firms 
dr frank young commissioner of food and drugs said that agency 
was evaluating the recommendations and will implement the changes 
as appropriate 
thursdays report said the fda has taken or planned a number of 
corrective actions 
the agency has been under fire since it was revealed that some 
generic drugs were not properly tested before being allowed on the 
market 
among other things the report said the procedures allow a 
branch chief to favor a particular company by assigning that 
companys applications to chemists who work rapidly while 
penalizing other companies by assigning their applications to slow 
reviewers 
hhs inspector general richard p kusserow said his investigation 
found three cases in which the same drug from competing companies 
had been assigned to the same chemist for review making it possible 
for the chemist to deliberately identify fewer deficiencies in one 
application while identifying numerous deficiencies in a 
competitors application 
the report also said the fda had established few standard 
procedures for chemists to use a situation it said may indirectly 
favor one companys application for which a chemist may do a minimal 
review and adversely affect another companys application for which 
a chemist may do an exhaustive review 
fda lacks a quality control system that assures the fundamental 
integrity and fairness of the review process the report said 
the report recommended that policies for random assignment of 
applications be developed and that there be other appropriate 
methods for reducing the opportunity to show any partiality to 
applicants

former secretary of housing and urban 
development samuel r pierce jr denied allegations of favoritism at 
hud and accused critics of misrepresenting his performance 
according to a newspaper interview 
everybody was treated the same he told the los angeles times 
in an interview published in fridays editions that was the 
advice and the word that i gave to the people at hud 
the interview marked pierces first public comments about the hud 
furor since he testified before congress may 25 
pierce contradicted that testimony in asserting in the interview 
that he was a handson manager he said however that he did not 
know of the extensive influence allegedly exercised by his former 
executive assistant deborah gore dean 
pierce said his efforts to help former law partners did not 
breach his pledge to sever his ties from the firm because he 
received no financial benefit from the favors and had no agreement 
to return to the firm 
testimony by former hud officials and documents has portrayed the 
agency under pierce who served throughout the reagan 
administration as plagued by mismanagement and influence peddling 
pierce would not discuss some subjects the times reported he 
noted that he is scheduled to testify again sept 15 and has a deal 
with a magazine he would not identify to publish his complete story 
next month 
but pierce strongly rejected allegations that highpowered 
republicans were given preferential treatment by hud saying that 
funding for projects was based on the merits 
you would look at their project and if was a worthy project 
they would be treated favorably if not they would lose it he 
said that was the basic approach to all of these it wasnt an 
approach that if they are a republican you have got to add 10 
points or give them something extra 
pierce said he believes some members of congress are attacking 
his operation of hud and misrepresenting his performance because 
these lawmakers traditional role in lobbying for hud grants was 
taken over in part by consultants 
developers have testified that they paid large amounts of money 
to consultants because the developers thought that doing so was 
essential to winning hud action in the pierce years

a major cabinet member at the center of a sex 
scandal resigned friday shaking a 2weekold administration that 
has pledged to clean up japans seamy politics 
the resignation of chief cabinet secretary tokuo yamashita the 
main government spokesman and top lieutenant to prime minister 
toshiki kaifu came one month after former prime minister sousuke 
uno plagued by allegations of extramarital affairs announced he 
was stepping down 
mayumi moriyama head of the environment agency was chosen to 
replace yamashita an official at the prime ministers office said 
speaking anonymously mrs moriyama 61 will be the first woman to 
hold that post 
mrs moriyama is serving her second term in the upper house of 
parliament and was first elected in 1980 the environment portfolio 
was her first cabinet post 
on thursday yamashita acknowledged his liaison with a bar 
hostess the acknowledgement came the same day the weekly magazine 
shukan shincho published a story describing the relationship that 
began in 1984 when the woman was 21 and lasted more than three 
years 
the kaifu administration had placed cleaning up politics at the 
head of its agenda and had been entrusted with the hopes of the 
people but in the end i have decided that i must resign he 
said at a televised press conference late friday morning 
i must offer my deepest apologies he said he added that he 
had apologized to his wife and that she had forgiven him yamashita 
69 and his wife kyoko have been married 45 years and have four 
grown daughters 
earlier friday he met with kaifu at the prime ministers 
official residence and later attended a regular weekly gathering of 
cabinet ministers 
the task of the kaifu cabinet is to promote clean government 
and as i must follow that and support the prime minister i can 
offer only my deepest apologies to the people of japan yamashita 
told a televised news conference thursday 
yamashita was appointed two weeks ago when kaifu formed a 
government after uno quit because of an election defeat that cost 
the liberal democrats their majority in the upper house of 
parliament 
uno was in office only two months hounded by allegations that he 
had kept paid mistresses 
noboru takeshita the man uno succeeded resigned to accept 
responsibility for the recruit co influencebuying scandal which 
reached the top ranks of government bureaucracy and business uno 
was chosen because it had not touched him 
the latest scandal was considered likely to erode public support 
for the kaifu administration which has said its priority is 
restoration of political ethics 
japanese society has been tolerant of rich and powerful men 
having affairs and mistresses and only recently have such matters 
been reported yamashita said thursday that such news would be 
reported was due completely to my own indiscretion 
yamashita had a reputation as a clean politician he was 
chosen because he belongs to the same party faction as kaifu and was 
not identified with the influencebuying scandal which contributed 
to the election defeat last month 
yotaro konaka a prominent author and social critic said 
thursday the public is not going to tolerate such insensitivity 
by political leaders people must doubt if the new government which 
appointed such a person to its top post just when political ethics 
has become a national issue has any common sense at all 
political analyst masaya ito said the scandal is particularly 
damaging for kaifu the public is not going to believe what he 
says from now on after such a digusting scandal i am sure many 
people are already feeling sick and tired of finding out about new 
scandals of their countrys leaders 
shukan shincho said in its edition published thursday that 
yamashita conducted the affair while serving as transport minister 
and head of the management and coordination agency 
it said he gave the woman 3 million yen 21000 on aug 3 when 
there was speculation he would get a high post in the new 
government and the woman returned it three days later the magazine 
said 
yamashita was quoted as denying he tried to buy silence and 
saying i did it from my own good intentions after hearing that 
shes still having problems in her life the woman was not 
identified

it started as a simple visit by a couple 
of soldiers in combat fatigues with an 8yearold boy dying of 
cancer 
but by the end of the day chris riley had enlisted in the army 
as a special soldier flown in a helicopter ridden in a tanklike 
vehicle called a mobile howitzer and made some new friends in the 
military 
it certainly is a dream come true said the boys father 
robert kip riley hes a big gi joe fan he was just 
thrilled to death just as thrilled as anyone could be with all 
these things 
chris has undergone surgery twice since november 1986 for a brain 
tumor said his mother gale riley she said chemotherapy was 
stopped last month after the cancer spread to chris spine leaving 
him in pain and too weak to walk 
now hes on constant morphine to keep away the pain mrs 
riley said and hes lost most of his mobility theres nothing 
more the doctors can do for him right now 
hes a loving boy it would have been nice to have all these 
things happen when he was able to follow them a little closer his 
father added 
chris clad in a camouflage uniform with a black military police 
armband and riley stitched above his right pocket nodded weakly 
when asked if he enjoyed the 10minute ride thursday in the howitzer 
across a hilly field a couple of blocks from his home in northern 
west virginia 
unable to speak much above a whisper the shy boy described the 
ride as loud 
i saw the look on his face and i sent them around the field 
again said maj john pack of the 201st field artillery unit of 
the west virginia army national guard as the howitzer roared up a 
hill with chris and his parents inside 
he loves gi joe and we wanted to make one of his dreams come 
true this is the closest thing we have to it 
poor weather conditions delayed chris ride in an army reserve 
uh1 helicopter until late afternoon 
hes just totally wiped out hes so happy said mrs riley 
his doctor called and said she didnt want him to go up but he 
wanted to do it 
earlier chris was sworn in during a special ceremony by capt 
duane hawn of the armys fairmont recruiting office which organized 
the event after a family friend suggested a visit from a couple of 
gi joes might cheer chris 
but carol taylor a secretary at the recruiting office wasnt 
about to let it stop there 
i said why dont we try for a helicopter and a tank said 
taylor i wasnt about to take no for an answer 
she didnt have to members of the armys pittsburgh recruiting 
battalion sent a fourman color guard and a stuffed bear decked out 
in a camouflage suit the 201st volunteered its equipment soldiers 
and weapons and hawn and 1st sgt gary johnson prepared an 
enlistment certificate for chris 
we have men here today who volunteered to come here because 
they have children said pack if their kids were going through

id want it for my son if he were chris age we definitely 
say a prayer each night for chris and if the good lords willing 
maybe hell pull though this

the earth is in no danger from a milewide 
chunk of space rock that zipped within about 25 million miles of 
the planet 
its just a nice close approach which makes it very convenient 
for astronomers who want to study it said brian marsden of the 
international astronomical unions central bureau in cambridge mass 
the asteroid named 1989 pb has been moving at many thousands 
miles per hour within close observation range of the earth for 
several days marsden said the point of closest approach about 25 
million miles away was estimated at about 11 pm edt thursday 
thats a little more than 10 times the average distance of the 
moon from earth about 239000 miles 
eleanor helin an astronomer for nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory discovered the asteroid aug 9 in film studies taken 
that day on a telescope at the palomar observatory in san diego 
when first seen the asteroid was outside the orbit of earth and 
angling inward toward the sun she said 
it will be adjacent then pass by and then lead the earth 
over the next few days she said 
helin said asteroid 1989 pb will arc away from the earths orbit 
pass around the sun dipping to a point inside the orbit of venus 
and then loop back out to just beyond the orbit of mars it is 
expected to cross the earths orbit again in about 13 months but 
as marsden noted the earth will not be there then 
asteroid 1989 pb is the sixth to make what marsden called a 
close approach to the earth this year but only one other has 
been closer 
in march 1989 fc passed within 460000 miles of the earth helin 
said this is believed to be the closest asteroid pass in the records 
of astronomy surpassing an asteroid named hermes that whizzed by 
480000 miles from the earth in 1937 
other close approaches and their distances from earth this year 
according to marsden 1989 da in february 6 million miles 1989 ja 
in june 8 million miles 1989 ac in january 10 million miles and 
1989 fb in early february 20 million to 30 million miles 
marsden said the cluster of close approaches is just a 
statistical fluke and implies nothing about future asteroids 
but eventually he said one of the rapidly moving space 
mountains will smash into the earth 
if we are talking about a period of within a million years one 
almost certainly will hit the earth he said 
the chances of a smaller asteroid hitting the earth is likely 
within a 1000 years or so he said noting that one about 100 
yards across exploded just over the siberian plains near tunguska in 
1908 the sound could be heard for hundreds of miles and the 
landscape was blasted as if by a small atomic bomb 
marsden said an object hit arizona about 25000 years ago 
creating a wellknown crater near flagstaff more than a mile across 
a theory supported by many scientists is that an asteroid that 
hit the earth 67 million years ago caused the extinction of the 
dinosaurs perhaps by causing a rapid change in the weather

a conservation group alleges that the commerce 
department is squelching important biological findings as it 
prepares new regulations to protect endangered sea turtles from 
drowning in shrimpers nets 
conservation of endangered species is not a matter of soviet 
intrigue and espionage marydele donnelly of the center for marine 
conservation said thursday 
caught between the opposing demands of shrimpers and 
environmentalists the agency has until sept 8 to draft final 
regulations to hold down mortality rates among five endangered 
species of sea turtles 
the conservation group says it has been unable to obtain 
biological opinions from commerce department scientists on the most 
effective way of preventing sea turtle deaths 
i dont know of any attempt to suppress any scientific 
findings any legal opinions or any counsel from anyone within the 
department on this issue said commerce spokesman brian gorman 
at issue is whether shrimpers must be required to equip their 
nets with devices that allow turtles to escape the method backed by 
environmentalists or whether they should restrict their tow times 
and check their nets before the submerged turtles drown the choice 
of many gulf coast shrimpers 
under temporary regulations shrimpers are being required to pull 
their nets every 105 minutes or use the turtle excluder devices

grocery stores may offer rain checks or 
substitutes when they run out of advertised specials or may specify 
beforehand that availability is limited the federal trade 
commission says 
a final rule to be published monday in the federal register and 
take effect four days later amends one adopted in 1971 that 
required grocers to stock enough advertised items to meet 
anticipated demand 
that rule had rarely been enforced and the commission voted in 
april 1988 to approve making the rule change making thursdays 
action largely a formality 
the ftc began reviewing its earlier rule in 1984 and determined 
that the cost of compliance outweighed the benefits according to 
the review the 1971 rule imposed an estimated 132 million to 370 
million in costs on retail food stores with those costs passed on 
to consumers

a demographic expert says minorities stand a 
good chance of gaining seats in the house after congressional 
district lines are redrawn based on results of the 1990 census 
william ohare director of policy studies at the population 
reference bureau also predicted that there is going to be a 
mountain of litigation over issues such as adjustments for 
undercounted minorities whether to exclude illegal aliens and 
inclusion of military personnel overseas in the count used for 
reapportionment 
in the 199192 reapportionment ohare said the states that 
are likely to gain the most congressional seats for example 
california texas florida all have large minority populations 
he said the countrys hispanic population was expected to show a 
particularly strong gain from about 145 million in 1980 up to a 
projected 22 million in the 1990 census with most of the increase 
concentrated in sunbelt states 
asked what net gain of minority members he expects there will be 
in the house ohare said certainly half a dozen to 10 is not 
unreasonable i would say thats optimistic but not 
outlandishly optimistic 
the 435seat house has 36 minority members 22 blacks nine 
hispanics four asianamericans and one american indian 
blacks make up about 12 percent of the us population but have 
only 15 percent of elected officials while hispanics comprise 8 
percent of the population but are less than 2 percent of elected 
officials ohare said 
the population reference bureau describes itself as a private 
nonpartisan organization that tries to increase public awareness 
and understanding of population issues

remembered the new prime minister as an honest noble man with 
high values an excellent negotiator and politician

being on the front line said kosinski 
in line with the change a group of 15 deputies on thursday 
submitted a proposal to drop from the constitution the clause that 
mandates that the communist party be the leading political force

the assassination of a promising young 
presidential hopeful has triggered a backlash against drug kingpins 
by colombians who have overcome their fear and are helping 
authorities fight back 
weve had a tremendous cooperation from the people the 
national police forces press chief col alfredo salgado said in 
an interview thursday 
the people have always wanted to cooperate with the police but 
they were afraid he said theyve left aside their fear and are 
cooperating 
when five suspects in the slaying of sen luis carlos galan were 
paraded before 15 witnesses this week the witnesses did not 
hesitate in fingering four of them police said 
they also said special hot lines set up to receive tips are 
providing information that has enabled police to raid several of the 
hundreds of drug lords estates and businesses as part of the 
crackdown 
salgado said the cooperation was inspired by citizens witnessing 
police for the first time engaged in a virtual allout war with 
the countrys drug cartels the crackdown was sparked by the 
assassinations of galan a police colonel and a magistrate in a 
48hour period last week 
galan 46 was a highly popular liberal party candidate for 
president and the widely acknowleged leader of a new political 
generation he was considered extremely honest and spoke vehemently 
about the need to eradicate the drug underworld 
an assassin pumped five bullets into his lower abdomen beneath 
his bulletproof vest as he stood on a small platform during a 
political rally on bogotas outskirts friday night several 
accomplices in the killing raked the air with gunfire to provoke 
panic and allow the triggermans escape 
traffickers previously had been blamed for the assassinations of 
a justice minister and an attorney general but galans slaying took 
drugsponsored violence to a new level colombians contend 
clara obregon lopez a former liberal party city council member 
in bogota said his murder showed the traffickers are attacking 
the core of the countrys institutions and want to replace the 
current political leadership 
the witnesses decision to identify the killers was a 
demonstration of the deep indignation of the people she said in 
an interview at her home 
the indignation is so strong that its not leaving room for 
fear she said 
fear is real and justified in colombia as mrs obregon lopez 
recalled traffickers two years ago killed a 9yearold girl who had 
witnessed the assassination of a leftist political leader in the 
town of barrancabermeja another witness survived for two years 
before being gunned down a few months ago 
since 1981 220 judges magistrates and judicial aides have been 
killed in the traffickers campaign of terror against the legal 
system 
each important assassination has appeared to galvanize colombian 
society but only temporarily previous crackdowns although not as 
intense as the current offensive have petered out in a few weeks 
on thursday the traffickers declared absolute war in 
response to the police and military actions and to the prospect of 
extradition should they be arrested they counterattacked with 
bombings and arson in medellin the home of the worlds biggest 
cocaine cartel 
mrs obregon lopez said it was evident they are trying to 
reinstill fear and dampen spirits to cut short this antinarcotics 
campaign 
us officials have said the colombian government must show its 
resolve by following through on a promise to extradite any drug 
lords who are arrested 
us and colombian authorities say they are trying to arrange the 
extradition of eduardo martinez romero a suspected finance manager 
for the medellin cartel caught on saturday 
two other possible subjects for extradition also described as 
important trafficking figures were arrested wednesday but the 
reputed cartel bosses have yet to be captured 
enrique santos calderon an editor of the respected bogota daily 
el tiempo said in a commentary thursday that the latest killings 
represent the most inconceivable challenge that the traffickers 
could have sent to the colombian state so arrogant and brutal as to 
appear delirious 
he called on the government of president virgilio barco to take 
even stronger action to destroy the cartels and capture their 
leaders 
has the hour finally arrived when we say enough already 
well know soon santos calderon said

researchers gazed at stark images 
of rips and tears in the white carcass of the edmund fitzgerald but 
those pictures brought them no closer to answering why the famed 
ship sank 
boy its awe inspiring to see but none of it is surprising 
said phil wright a canadian archaeologist on board the research 
vessel grayling that floated above the fitzgerald wreckage again 
thursday 
researchers used a small submersible robot to obtain the first 
clear footage of the sunken boat the expedition is being filmed for 
the national geographic societys explorer television series 
the 729foot steel freighter was carrying 27000 tons of iron ore 
down lake superior when it sank in a gale nov 10 1975 all 29 crew 
members died 
the tragedy became legend within a year when canadian balladeer 
gordon lightfoot sang of the crew all that remains is the faces 
and the names of the wives and the sons and the daughters 
wright and other researchers aboard the grayling marveled at 
video images showing the fitzgeralds crumpled pilothouse and 
severed hull portholes were blown out and halfinch thick steel was 
crinkled like tinfoil while the ships bell and water cooler 
remained untouched 
i was surprised by the visibility i was surprised that the 
bell was sitting on top its just unreal said tom farnquist 
director of the great lakes shipwreck historical society at 
whitefish point and one of three expedition leaders 
the official us coast guard report said the fitzgerald sank 
after taking on water through its hatches as it plowed through 
30foot waves others believe the storm dropped the ship onto a 
shoal punching a hole in its hull 
in either case the boat sank so quickly there was never a 
distress call the captains last words were that his ship was 
holding its own in the storm 
wright said he didnt see any evidence that lent weight to either 
theory 
a 2 to 4foot rip in the front of the fitzgeralds hull puzzled 
researchers somewhat wright theorized the damage occurred when the 
boat struck the bottom of the lake 
at the speed she was going when she hit the bottom boom he 
said shoving his fist into his hand to illustrate an impact that 
would have cracked open the freighter 
i just find that terribly inexplicable said author fred 
stonehouse also on board the grayling its almost like you 
cracked an eggshell in this case its halfinch steel 
an answer to why the modern freighter sank would be nice but 
expedition leaders are more interested in testing the submersible 
robot and its threedimensional camera system for use on other 
shipwrecks

the newly consolidated lutheran churchs 
interim policy against ordaining practicing homosexuals prompted a 
clergywoman to comment so this is the policy we will have about 
it while we are trying to develop a policy about it 
the remark by the rev gwendolyn king of hanover nh indicates 
the somewhat misty hiatus in which the church finds itself on 
various social issues 
in keeping with lutheranisms characteristic analytical approach 
the evangelical lutheran church in americas first decisionmaking 
assembly called for more study before taking definite stands on 
several sensitive questions including sexuality 
of that subjects myriad aspects the rev gerald l falk of 
chicago executive director of the churchs socialconcerns 
commission said its a very difficult issue that we must study 
carefully prayerfully and thoroughly so that we can discern the 
path which god is calling us to follow 
the evangelical lutheran church in america is the result of the 
jan 1 1988 merger of the lutheran church in america the american 
lutheran church and the association of evangelical lutheran churches 
the 53millionmember denomination ordered studies on a batch of 
issues including the homeless family life capital punishment and 
health care 
action was pending on a proposal for a twoyear study of 
sexuality including homosexuality and abortion but a womens 
caucus was pressing for immediate action on abortion 
its a stopgap until the study is done said barbara nelson 
of lindsborg kan it was proposed as necessary because of the 
recent supreme court decision allowing some state regulation of 
abortion 
sidestepping numerous proposals by different congregations and 
regional synods for definite stands on various social issues the 
assembly referred most of them for study 
responding briefly on a grassroots proposal the assembly did 
condemn racism as a sin and urged lutherans to stay alert to the 
destructive results of racism 
also the church affirmed commitment to a just and equitable 
welfare system and encouraged those engaged in the task of 
welfare reform 
the assembly asked for study of gun control by lutherans a 
church commission and by government to explore options for better 
management of these weapons through an outright ban or regulation of 
lawful sales 
on health care the assembly declared it supported high quality 
health care for everyone and advocated legislation to achieve 
that goal but authorized studies to develop a policy on the matter 
the 1050 voting delegates still had before them some proposed 
actions on divestment from companies doing business in south africa 
and on membership in major ecumenical councils 
the eightday assembly began wednesday 
noting that many issues were being delayed for studies prior to 
action at the second biennial assembly in 1991 the churchs 
president bishop herbert w chilstrom said this means that our 
1991 assembly should be a lively one

four alleged colombian drug kingpins 
face charges in us indictments that resulted from testimony in the 
1988 conviction of a leader of the medellin drug cartel carlos 
lehder rivas 
the other reputed medellin cartel leaders pablo escobar gaviria 
jose gonzalo rodriguez gacha jorge ochoa vasquez and fabio ochoa 
vasquez were on the most wanted list of 12 colombian drug 
dealers issued by the us justice department this week the four 
were indicted last march in jacksonville 
those four along with ochoas brother jorge ochoa vasquez were 
also indicted on drug trafficking charges in 1986 in miami all are 
atlarge 
about 80 alleged colombian drug traffickers have been indicted in 
the united states but their cases have languished since the 
colombian supreme court overturned its extradition treaty with the 
united states in 1987 
colombian president virgilio barco prompted by last weeks 
assassination of presidential candidate luis carlos galan 
instituted emergency measures to allow the immediate resumption of 
extraditions 
the extradition treaty was overturned shortly after the 
extradition of former cartel leader lehder in 1987 he was tried in 
jacksonville convicted of operating a continuing criminal 
enterprise and is now in federal prison serving a life sentence 
without parole 
cartel leaders thursday declared war on the colombian government 
just as bombs blew up offices of two principal political parties in 
the colombian city of medellin which serves as a base for the 
worlds biggest cocaine cartel 
at the time of the march indictment us attorney robert w 
genzman said that escobar was responsible for the april 1983 
assassination of colombian justice minister lara bonilla 
after the killing according to the indictment cartel members 
including escobar lehder rodriquez and fabio and jorge ochoa fled 
to nicaragua 
in nicaragua the cartel brought in 1400 kilograms of cocaine to 
the los brasiles air force base most of the cocaine was flown into 
the united states 
one of the flights resulted in the seizure of 665 kilograms of 
cocaine by the federal drug enforcement administration a second 
cocaine flight was made by lehders pilots from nicaragua over cuba 
to andros island in the bahamas and eventually into united states 
if convicted of the jacksonville indictment which lists 205 
separate acts beginning in 1974 and continuing until this year the 
ochoas escobar and rodriquez would face mandatory life prison 
terms prosecutors said the indictment involves the importation of 
44000 pounds of cocaine worth 1 billion in all 30 people were 
named in the indictment 
lehder was convicted of creating a small private air force and 
then using the bahamian island of normans cay as a way station for 
shipments for more than 20 tons of cocaine into the united states 
for the medellin cartel 
the miami indictment which alleges smuggling activities of the 
medellin cartel from 1978 to 1986 claims the practices used by the 
cartel included the corruption of the public officials of foreign 
govenments the use of force violence threats physical assaults 
and murders of informants discordant employees and cartel 
opponents

a pilot was cleared of criminal complicity 
in a july 1988 helicopter escape from the state penitentiary and he 
said he is bitter over what he considers persecution by law 
enforcement agencies 
following an eightday trial a jury deliberated fewer than three 
hours thursday before acquitting charles bella of conspiracy and 
three counts of assisting a prison escape all felonies 
the el paso texas pilot said afterward hes 500000 in debt 
because of the trial and damage to his helicopter justice 
triumphed but he is considering suing new mexico he added 
im going to try to get a little bit more justice in this 
state bella said 
bella had testified that he was hijacked july 11 1988 by 
beverly shoemaker a girlfriend of inmate daniel mahoney and forced 
at gunpoint to land in the prison recreation yard to pick up three 
inmates 
he then flew to mid valley where the escapees and ms shoemaker 
fled from the helicopter leaving bella handcuffed to a control 
stick he said inmate preston mitchell returned to the helicopter 
stuck a pistol to his head and ordered him to take off 
thats when a us customs officer fired at the gazelle helicopter 
and hit a landing skid 
they are either going to try to kill you from the outside or 
persecute you on the inside bella said thursday 
bella said hes working on a book because there is a lot to be 
learned from this experience things were done to me that shouldnt 
have been done 
district attorney chet walter said of course we regret but 
accept the jurys verdict we do regret that the jury did not have 
at its disposal in making its decision all the evidence that the 
prosecution had at its disposal 
the judge excluded all hearsay statements by inmate randy mack 
lackey 
the state alleged that bella conspired with lackey mahoney 
mitchell and ms shoemaker and that he received 30000 
bella testified that he was contacted on the weekend prior to the 
escape by a man identifying himself as bill allen of allen real 
estate in santa fe who hired him for an aerial real estate survey 
he said he was hijacked shortly after picking up ms shoemaker at 
santa fe airport and forced at gunpoint to land in the penitentiary 
recreation yard to pick up the inmates 
ms shoemaker who also was charged with conspiracy and three 
counts of assisting a prison escape pleaded guilty last week and 
testified for the defense her account mainly matched bellas and 
contradicted lackeys 
the three inmates were charged with conspiracy and prison escape 
mahoney was tried and convicted in april lackey pleaded guilty in 
april to a single charge of prison escape and was sentenced to a 
10year prison term with seven years suspended mitchells trial is 
pending 
former state attorney general david norvell who teamed with f 
lee bailey in defense of bella said the fairly brief deliberation 
shows the decision was swift and dispositive and consistent with 
what we thought should have been the disposition all along

national police colonel and a magistrate drug traffickers were 
blamed 
many of the drug lords face charges in the united states and the 
colombian government promised to extradite any who are arrested 
early thursday traffickers infuriated by the crackdown bombed 
offices of the liberal and conservative party offices in downtown 
medellin killing a passerby 
they also set fire to the weekend retreats of two prominent 
politicians on the outskirts of medellin an industrial city 215

police spokesman col alfredo salgado 
the people have always wanted to cooperate with the police but 
they were afraid he said theyve left aside their fear and are 
cooperating 
barco said seized cash automobiles and trucks will be used to 
improve judges working conditions and air and sea craft will go to 
the defense ministry and the air forces commercial transport 
business 
the president also ordered an inventory of all colombias private 
airstrips those whose legitimate use cannot be proved will be

politicians say the latest wave of 
drugsponsored violence including the slaying of a presidential 
candidate threatens the countrys electoral process 
in march colombians are to choose a new congress and mayors in 
may a presidential vote is planned and campaigning is already 
under way 
but according to expresident misael pastrana borrero leader of 
the opposition conservative party the electoral process is badly 
compromised both by cocaine traffickers and leftist guerrillas 
there are at least 50 municipalities in which it is impossible 
to conduct political campaigning he said in a local radio 
interview under these conditions the electoral process is 
wounded 
those municipalities are effectively controlled by leftist 
guerrilla organizations or hit squads funded by narcotics 
traffickers allied with rightwing extremists 
the death squads are blamed for countless slayings of leftist and 
labor activists and also conduct what is euphemistically called 
social cleansing the killing of vagabonds prostitutes the 
elderly and infirm 
several leftist guerrilla groups are active in the country they 
control many rural areas attack military and economic targets 
including oil pipelines and kidnap for ransom 
ernesto samper pizano a liberal party senator and presidential 
candidate complained that there are no guarantees of safety for 
the electoral campaign 
he said he feared that the process might be jeopardized by new 
and unfortunate acts of violence 
last friday assassins believed hired by cocaine traffickers 
killed the liberal partys leading presidential candidate sen luis 
carlos galan his death capped a 48hour wave of drugsponsored 
slayings that included a police chief and a magistrate 
samper pizano said candidates will change their campaign strategy 
to focus more on television spots and cut the number of potentially 
dangerous public appearances 
political campaigning was suspended indefinitely after galans 
slaying 
the new violence comes as democracy is broadening its base 
mayors used to be appointed and were elected for the first time 
only last year 
colombia has endured constant political bloodshed throughout the 
1900s including a bloody rural war between the liberals and the 
conservatives between 1948 and 1958 the only interruption in the 
democratic process was between 1953 and 1957 when a military 
government ruled

next years asian games in beijing will be the 
first held under martial law if china does not lift the security 
measure the president of the olympic council of asia said today 
but sheikh fahad al ahmad al sabah of kuwait told reporters after 
an eightday inspection tour of the asian games facilities that he 
was confident china could open the games as planned on sept 22 
1990 
there has been much speculation about whether martial law 
instituted in late may during the popular democracy movement would 
be lifted before the 11th asian games martial law troops armed with 
assault rifles still are stationed at major intersections and 
bridges throughout the capital 
if there is martial law or any other security system it 
doesnt concern the oca the sheikh said 
fahad did not say if chinese officials had told him whether 
martial law would end before the games 
he also did not say if any of the olympic committees 38 member 
countries in asia planned to boycott the games hong kong residents 
have urged a boycott to protest the june crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement in which hundreds perhaps thousands were 
killed 
fahad said he was satisifed with the progress the chinese have 
made in preparing for the games which will include 27 events 
between 6500 and 7000 athletes and officials are expected to 
attend in addition 4000 journalists are expected 
the oca feels that the percentage of construction already 
completed is very satisfactory they have reason to believe that all 
the construction facilities will be ready ahead of time the 
olympic committee delegation said in a news release 
reporters touring the main games complex in northern beijing 
earlier this week could see that much work remained to be done a 
future press center and two planned hotels were mere shells and the 
swimming stadium and warmup gym had roofs but no walls 
construction of 16 stadiums and renovation of 11 existing 
facilities slowed to a virtual crawl last winter because of a 
shortage of building materials and theft work was interrupted this 
spring by the studentled democracy movement which hampered 
delivery of supplies workers were lured off the job to watch or 
participate 
asked what he thought was the biggest problem fahad said 
security is a great problem food is a great problem 
transportation is a great problem communication is a great problem 
accommodations is a great problem all these are great problems 
chinese officials have acknowledged that funding also is a 
problem 
wu zhongyuan spokesman for chinas asian games committee said 
on monday that the estimated cost of holding the games has risen to 
673 million up from last years estimate of 565 million 
to raise money and to drum up enthusiasm for the games officials 
have started selling lottery tickets which ordinarily are illegal 
interest seems to be high with crowds gathered around tables set up 
on main streets to buy the tickets which each go for 1 yuan or 
about 27 cents the top prize is worth 270 
red banners throughout the city appeal to residents patriotism 
and exhort them to help with asian games preparations collection 
boxes have been seen on some streets and a billboard at a major 
intersection counts down the number of days left until the opening 
ceremony

agreement after meeting twice on thursday 
we look forward to getting everyone back to work said bell 
atlantic spokesman larry plumb

strike by 10000 ohio bell employees thursday with both the cwa and 
the company indicating interest in making headway meetings were

concessions as part of the collective bargaining process no further

a woman trying to convince authorities that 
her exhusband sexually abused their daughter has been offered help 
by two people who say they were molested by him years ago 
jesse murabito 40 fled with her two children after her former 
husband mark russell murabito was acquitted in november of charges 
that he sexually assaulted his daughter in 1987 the judge in the 
couples divorce heard a week of testimony before rejecting similar 
allegations 
now brett spaulding 23 of fort myers fla and elisa 
robinson 26 of groton conn say they were sexually molested by 
murabito as children when they lived with their families at a 
religious community in epping 
asked to comment on the allegations murabitos lawyer raymond 
kellett called them slanderous and another case of jesse trying 
to introduce sensationalism to the case 
murabito referred all questions to kellett 
murabito 34 of derry received joint custody with the state of 
his daughter 6 and son 4 after mrs murabito went underground 
with the children they were found in montana earlier this month and 
the children are in foster care at an undisclosed location in new 
hampshire 
spaulding said he was 5 years old when mark murabito then about 
16 sexually abused him on the grounds of green pastures community 
of the emissaries of divine light church in epping 
i remember everyone else was going to dinner when rusty 
murabito called me by my first name spaulding said in a 
telephone interview from fort myers i went over and he pulled me 
by the hair and took me into a hall and wouldnt let me leave he 
made me have oral sex with him 
spaulding said he doesnt remember much more his mother alice 
spaulding 60 said her son described the alleged sex act to her 
after he returned home late that day 
spaulding said he and his parents put the incident behind them 
and didnt think of it until a friend of his mothers visiting from 
new hampshire brought them a newspaper article on the murabitos 
case the case made national news two years ago when mrs murabito 
hid the children and went to jail for a week rather than let them 
visit their father 
he said he decided to come forward because he didnt want the 
same thing to happen to someone else 
robinson said murabito molested her when she was about 8 years 
old 
rusty was the baby sitter one night when the adults were at the 
chapel robinson said in a telephone interview from groton i 
was supposed to be asleep but had been reading a book when i heard 
rusty coming up the stairs 
i put the book down and pretended to be asleep she said 
he sat on the edge of the bed pulled the cover down and pulled 
my underwear down then he sat and stared at my crotch for a while 
robinson said she felt very uncomfortable and embarrassed 
afterward 
unlike the spauldings and robinson and her mother murabito and 
his family did not live at the religious community but went to 
green pastures for church services and functions 
robinson said she kept silent about the incident for 10 years 
before telling her mother robinson said she followed the murabito 
case in the news and became interested in it when she moved to 
exeter briefly last year while murabitos felonious sexual assault 
trial was in progress 
robinson said she wanted to testify against murabito at the 
trial but rockingham county superior court judge robert temple 
wouldnt allow it county attorney carleton eldredge said the judge 
would not let her take the stand because murabitos prior behavior 
had no bearing on the case 
eldredge said he considers robinson credible and believes her 
story 
mrs spaulding said she and her husband told church authorities 
about the incident and that murabito wasnt allowed on the farm for 
a long time 
tom starrs a spokesman for green pastures said he knew nothing 
about spauldings claims he said the church officials who ran green 
pastures at the time are dead and the church kept no records that 
could document the story 
i never heard anything of it before and would find it hard to 
believe he murabito is a fine person said starrs

foreign minister moshe arens trip to kenya to 
sign a cooperation pact is part of a diplomatic offensive offering 
agricultural and military help to african countries in return for 
political support 
the effort has been faring well despite third world criticism of 
israels battle against the palestinian uprising in the occupied 
lands israeli ties with south africa and arab attempts to block 
israeli inroads in the region 
surprisingly the palestinian uprising has had little effect on 
african nations seeking better relations with israel said naomi 
chazan an africa expert at hebrew university in jerusalem 
arens left for nairobi on thursday night and was to sign an 
agreement today with kenya that provides for assistance in water 
conservation desert reclamation and soil preservation eighty 
percent of kenyas land is arid and unsuitable for agriculture 
military analysts say kenya also received shipments of 
surfacetosurface missiles from israel last year 
in return for such aid one highly placed foreign ministry source 
said african nations are expected to show good will and abstain 
from voting on antiisrael resolutions in the united nations 
thirty african nations broke relations with israel during the 
1973 middle east war in a show of support for israels arab 
adversaries 
since then black africa has joined forces with arab and east 
bloc nations in repeatedly censuring israel in the united nations 
but israeli officials see this situation as turning around 
in the last seven years we are slowly but surely regaining our 
1973 position in africa said meir yoffe head of the african desk 
at the foreign ministry 
chazan said however that this is a gradual and incremental 
process israel will probably not entirely regain its former 
status 
seven countries have resumed full relations with israel in recent 
years including liberia the ivory coast togo cameroon zaire and 
most recently kenya and the central african republic israel has a 
diplomatic representative in ghana operating through the swiss 
embassy 
malawi swaziland and lesotho never broke ties 
the diplomatic thaw is a result of political changes in the 
region and a decline in arab aid resulting from dwindling oil 
revenues 
the 1979 israelegypt peace treaty that normalized relations 
between the former enemies led african countries to feel it was 
permissible to resume relations yoffe said 
the palestine liberation organization which for years demanded 
israel be destroyed last year accepted the jewish states right to 
exist giving kenya just the opportunity it was waiting for this 
gave legitimacy to its action said a source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
israeli sources say african countries often threaten to resume 
ties with israel as leverage to gain aid from arab countries 
israel has much to offer africa twothirds desert itself israel 
has perfected roughandready agricultural techniques suitable to 
africas arid climate and rugged conditions 
our advisers go out into the bush while other advisers stay at 
their hotels in the capital yoffe said 
a defense data bank in london reports that israel also is 
providing military hardware and training to african nations 
reports say zairean president sese seko mobutos palace guard is 
israelitrained and israeli advisers are reportedly active in 
ethiopia cameroon liberia and guinea 
unconfirmed reports speak of israel sending advisers and military 
supplies to gambia the cenral african republic chad uganda and 
sierra leone 
it is in israels interest to keep african countries stable 
politically a senior israeli source said on condition of 
anonymity 
israeli development projects in africa now total 400 million 60 
percent of which is in countries that do not have relations with 
israel senior government sources said 
nigeria an african nation with a large moslem population and no 
formal ties with israel is the largest recipient of israeli 
technical aid they said 
nigeria is an important and influential state chazan said 
everyone is watching it and wondering whether it will resume 
relations with israel 
parallel to israeli advances the plo has established a number of 
offices in african nations 
the african countries are using this to signal that israel and 
the arabs are not mutually exclusive in africa chazan said

former secretary of housing and urban 
development samuel r pierce jr in an interview published today 
strongly rejected allegations that his department gave highpowered 
republicans preferential treatment 
everybody was treated the same he told the los angeles times 
in his first published interview in three months that was the 
advice and the word that i gave to the people at hud 
pierce also said his efforts to help former law partners did not 
breach his pledge to sever ties to the firm because he received no 
financial benefit from the favors and had no agreement to return to 
the firm 
pierce who was in the cabinet throughout the reagan 
administration had not commented publicly about the hud influence 
peddling furor since he testified before congress may 25 he is 
scheduled to testify again sept 15 and said he is looking forward 
to setting the record straight 
pierce in the interview would not discuss some subjects citing 
his upcoming testimony and a deal with a magazine he did not 
identify to publish his complete story next month 
he would not discuss why he ordered hud in 1985 to fund a durham 
nc housing project that was opposed by many staff members but 
supported by the republican mayor of durham the mayor was a former 
law colleague of pierces and a former reagan campaign strategist 
i had what i think anyway were good reasons but i will have 
to save that for the subcommittee he said 
pierce insisted funding for projects was based on merits he said 
he believes some members of congress whom he would not identify are 
attacking him because these lawmakers traditional role in lobbying 
for hud grants was taken over in part by consultants 
developers have testified that they paid large amounts of money 
to consultants because they thought doing so was essential to 
winning hud action in the pierce years 
some of these congressmen they are saying nobody can get you 
this but us this is our job and we dont want any competition 
said pierce 
pierce asserted that he was a handson manager but acknowledged 
he did not know of the extensive influence allegedly exercised by 
his former executive assistant deborah gore dean 
in his may testimony pierce said that he was not a handson 
manager and that he was not involved in recommending funding for 
specific projects but later testimony by other former officials 
showed that pierce was directly involved in some projects 
of course i was involved in making decisions and 
recommendations he said you cant be in a job for eight years 
and not make a decision 
the congressional inquiry was sparked by allegations that huds 
moderate rehabilitation program to repair rental housing for the 
poor and elderly was beset by favoritism testimony has disclosed 
that ms dean rather than a committee made many of the decision 
about which projects were funded 
i didnt find out until the hearings that it was working that 
way pierce said i had a damn good right to think that it was 
working right 
ms dean has refused to testify and has asserted through her 
attorneys that hud funding decisions were made by pierce

the soviet union has turned to south 
korea for ship repairs in asia by shifting away from singapore and 
japan industry officials said today 
south korean shipyards have repaired 36 soviet ships and earned 
55 million since the end of last year when the two countries began 
direct economic dealings despite a lack of diplomatic ties they 
said 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said it is 
more expensive to have ships repaired in japan and that south korea 
is closer to soviet far eastern ports than singapore 
most of the repairs the first half of this year went to hyundai 
mipo dockyard co ltd which operates a major repair yard in ulsan

the cold war was nothing compared to the 
worldwide heat war possible if us and soviet leaders fail to 
cooperate to halt global warming scientists said 
climate shifts and a rising sea level could pit rich nations 
against poor northern nations against southern and inland nations 
against coastal participants at a ussoviet conference on global 
warming said thursday 
a sealevel rise of three feet in the next century would force 
millions of people to flee the lowlands of bangladesh and other 
third world nations creating environmental refugees said 
astronomer carl sagan 
where will those people go are there going to be food wars or 
water wars what happens if the american midwest becomes scrub 
desert sagan asked 
sagan is one of more than 80 americans and 11 soviets 
participating in a fourday symposium dubbed greenhouse glasnost 
by its cosponsors the soviet academy of sciences and the institute 
for resource management founded by actorfilmmaker robert redford 
we have to get past this business of hearing the phrase we 
need more study redford said we must act 
the united states and soviet union are the worlds biggest 
producers of carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons gases that trap 
solar heat in a process called the greenhouse effect 
the superpowers leadership is needed because developing nations 
are fast catching up with the superpowers in producing pollutants 
sagan said 
you cant tell these third world countries please dont do 
what we did he said the united states and soviet union have 
to come in with economically feasible alternatives 
developing countries have few resources to adapt to major climate 
shifts sagan said but even wealthy nations cannot stop global 
warming alone 
the planet is a unit no one nation can solve the problem he 
said were all in the greenhouse together 
soviet scientist roald sagdeev recalled a warning he recently 
gave a russian audience i suggested that the issue of 
environmental survival should be elevated to the level of nuclear 
survival 
conference organizers hope to contact president bush and soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev to urge concrete steps to reduce global 
warming 
suggested strategies include increasing energy efficiency to 
reduce levels of carbon dioxide emitted by burning fossil fuels 
slowing the destruction of the worlds forests and planting new 
trees 
although scientists do disagree theyre all in the same 
ballpark sagan said various studies predict global temperatures 
will rise 3 to 10 degrees during the next century even the low 
figure could cause catastrophic climate changes 
that there is something to worry about a concurrence of the 
oracles is very clear sagan said 
but it may not be the lack of knowledge that proves the biggest 
stumbling block said sen bill bradley dnj 
politicians are aware but politicians are fervently 
shortsighted bradley said they look at the next election and 
not the next generation 
if policymakers wait for more conclusive evidence it will be too 
late said peter gleick a researcher at the pacific institute for 
studies in development environment and security 
even if we were to take drastic actions today climate changes 
are already in the works he said 
soviets at the conference include climatologists a filmmaker and 
an author americans include scientists and business environmental 
and political leaders 
redford said the conference invited nonscientists to spread 
support for the fight against global warming 
were here to pass the baton from scientific people who know 
whats going on to the rest of us who can do something about it

a key cabinet member resigned today after 
apologizing for having an extramarital affair and prime minister 
toshiki kaifu gave the job to a woman 
mayumi moriyama 61 directorgeneral of the environment agency 
was named to replace tokuo yamashita 69 as chief cabinet 
secretary a highly visible post that includes speaking on behalf of 
the government and coordinating cabinet affairs she is the first 
woman ever to hold the post 
it is the second sex scandal to hit the conservative liberal 
democratic party in two months sousuke uno announced his 
resignation as prime minister in july amid allegations he had an 
extramarital affair with an exgeisha 
mrs moriyamas appointment was widely seen as intended to 
contain damage caused by the latest scandal but analysts and party 
officials expressed doubt about whether she has enough experience to 
handle the current situation 
i was just appointed and i cant really tell what it is going 
to be like she said in a news conference but as far as my near 
40year professional experience is concerned i never felt any 
handicaps for being a woman 
yamashita announced his resignation this morning after 
apologizing for an extramarital affair with a bar hostess 43 years 
younger than him 
the kaifu administration had placed cleaning up politics at the 
head of its agenda and had been entrusted with the hopes of the 
people but in the end i have decided that i must resign 
yamashita told a news conference 
he said he had apologized to his wife kyoko and that she had 
forgiven him they have been married 45 years and have four grown 
daughters 
kaifu told reporters that he regretted the resignation of 
yamashita his aide and close friend but said he would continue to 
promote political reforms 
mrs moriyama has experience as a housewife as well as that of 
a bureaucrat he said i would like her to push foward political 
reforms from the standpoint of the people 
a former bureaucrat in the labor ministry mrs moriyama was 
first elected to the upper house of parliament in 1980 she never 
held a cabinet post until kaifu appointed her two weeks ago to head 
the environment agency 
her late husband kinji moriyama a member of the lower house of 
parliament was transport minister and directorgeneral of the 
science and technology agency in past governments 
soichiro tawara a prominent political critic said mrs 
moriyamas appointment is apparently aimed at bettering the image 
of the government but i cant help thinking the choice was made 
perhaps a little too hastily and lightly 
she may be helpful in some ways but i am not confident that a 
politician with such limited experience can handle perhaps the most 
demanding position in the cabinet 
tawara added that the liberal democratic party seems to be 
ignoring the essence of politics 
as a result he said one problem leads to another it 
doesnt look like the ldps trouble ends with this 
but another political critic noriko kimoto said the 
unprecedented appointment of a woman to the high office will be a 
gain for japan 
the task of the chief cabinet secretary may be overwhelming for 
mrs moriyama with her limited experience but in the long run i 
believe it was the only positive effect of the ugly sex scandal 
she said 
the immediate goal of kaifus 2weekold administration is to 
salvage public support for the government and the liberal democratic 
party 
but analysts said yamashitas resignation will severely undermine 
kaifus leadership 
the sex scandal will be particularly damaging for the kaifu 
government said promiment political analyst masaya ito the 
clean and progressive image was said to be the only strength for the 
kaifu administration which lacks a strong power base within the 
party 
the partys popularity has been severely eroded because its 
leaders were involved in bribery and sex scandals and the public 
also dislikes a new 3 percent sales tax passed by the liberal 
democrats 
kaifu replaced uno who resigned after only two months in office 
following his sex scandal and the partys worst election defeat 
yamashita became the sixth cabinet member including former prime 
ministers noboru takeshita and uno to resign in disgrace in less 
than a year 
leaders of the opposition camp eager to take over the government 
for the first time from the liberal democrats quickly opened attack 
following yamashitas resignation 
i am completely speechless said takako doi chairwoman of 
the japan socialist party the largest opposition group i wonder 
what he thinks women are it is a reflection of a lack of 
responsibility of the ldp 
eiko nukiyama vice chairwoman of the democratic socialist party 
said society has been much more generous toward politicians than 
ordinary people on matters regarding money and women until recently 
but i think in principle politics must be based on strong 
morality and higher ethical standards should be enforced on 
politicians

former ptl vice president richard dortch 
said he was humiliated by his actions that resulted in an eightyear 
prison sentence and a 200000 fine 
i failed my master failed my family and failed myself said 
dortch as he pleaded for mercy at his sentencing thursday 
dortchs sentence was part of a plea agreement in exchange for 
testimony against jim bakker founder of the television ministry 
whose trial on the same fraud and conspiracy charges starts monday 
i could not believe that i participated in this in 
deceiving people in doing something i knew was wrong dortch said 
after prosecutors showed the judge charts detailing a pattern of 
financial manipulations at ptl the shame of that was the most 
humiliating thing i have ever known 
prosecutor deborah smith said memos between dortch and the ptl 
financial office showed calculated attempts to hide ptls financial 
difficulties 
the victims in this case are in the thousands she said 
they are waiting to see the courts assessments they are waiting 
for justice 
dortch bakkers top assistant at ptl pleaded guilty earlier 
this month to four counts of conspiracy and fraud and agreed to 
testify against bakker bakker is charged with using ministry funds 
to finance his opulent lifestyle including expensive homes cars 
and an airconditioned dog house 
dortch is the third former bakker aide to be convicted former 
aides james and david taggart were convicted of evading taxes on 
11 million in ministry funds that prosecutors said they used to 
buy cartier jewelry designer clothes and a manhattan apartment 
they will be sentenced sept 8 
thursday prosecutors presented evidence that even though dortch 
and bakker said there would be a limit of 30000 lifetime 
partnerships sold in the towers hotel at ptls heritage usa 
religious theme park 68755 partnerships were sold 
lifetime partners made a onetime donation of 1000 in exchange 
for three nights free lodging each year for life but the towers 
hotel and other hotels planned for heritage usa were never built or 
were left uncompleted 
prosecutors said the towers project alone generated 742 million 
but only 114 million was spent on the uncompleted facility 
the indictment alleges that the ptl executives spent more than 4 
million on themselves and used some of it for operating expenses 
the charts showed that dortch collected 1128735 in salaries 
bonuses and taxdeferred retirement payments between january 1984 
and june 1987 the bonuses alone in those three years amounted to 
550000 
investigators also said that dortch lived rentfree in a 
ptlowned home valued at 400000 and that he had asked ptls 
builder to bury 233000 in parsonage renovations in the 
construction account for the towers hotel project 
dortch didnt attempt to blame bakker 
i lost the thing that i lived for my ministry he said his 
voice cracking before he was sentenced 
us district judge robert potter gave dortch four years in 
prison and a 100000 fine on the wire fraud charge and four years 
in prison and a 100000 fine on the conspiracy the prison terms 
were consecutive

compulsive gamblers have disturbances in their 
central nervous systems that may partly emerge in their 
personalities particularly in their tendency to be risk takers and 
sensation seekers a study says 
but experts in treating compulsive gamblers said the study cannot 
answer the question of whether the altered chemical activity is a 
cause or a result of gambling or whether it might characterize all 
hooked gamblers 
the study found that high levels of certain chemical reactions in 
the nervous systems of 17 compulsive gamblers were associated with 
high scores for extraversion on a written personality test 
extraversion is a psychiatric term for the tendency to be 
outgoing physically and socially active and to take risks 
psychiatrists say 
the researchers who reported their findings in the august issue 
of the american medical associations archives of general 
psychiatry said the chemicals they studied are important in the 
phenomenon of physical arousal 
physical arousal previous research suggests may be both a 
major reinforcer and a maintaining factor in pathological 
gambling said the study conducted at the national institutes of 
health in bethesda md 
researchers looked at chemicals taken from blood urine and 
spinal fluid that indicated activity in the bodys noradrenergic 
system which governs such diverse processes as the functioning of 
organs and communications between nerve cells in the brain 
subjects were men who had met the psychiatric definition of 
compulsive gamblers and who participated as inpatients at an nih 
research unit in bethesda said the authors of the study led by dr 
alec roy he could not be reached for comment thursday when his 
telephone went unanswered 
whats most important about the article is that people are 
beginning to realize that compulsive gambling is an illness which 
is something i dont think pete rose is ready to admit said dr 
paul fink medical director of the philadelphia psychiatric center 
which runs a treatment program for pathological gamblers 
rose manager of the cincinnati reds was banned from 
majorleague baseball for life thursday for betting on his own team 
allegations that rose denies 
but fink immediate past president of the american psychiatric 
association cautioned that the study couldnt say whether the 
chemical activity preceded the gambling or followed it 
and he said the small sample of subjects did not justify 
generalizations about all compulsive gamblers 
durand f jacobs a research psychologist and a board member of 
the national council on compulsive gambling agreed 
i think the research is very important but it needs 
further testing and verification he said in a telephone interview 
thursday from loma linda calif where he is psychology director of 
the veterans administration hospital 
jacobs said his own theory on addictions based on 30 years of 
research is that regardless of biological conditions all addicts 
have had a childhood where theyve been subject to experiences that 
make them feel inferior they feel inadequate and no matter 
what they do its never enough 
dr richard j rosenthal a psychiatrist at the university of 
california at los angeles said he has found a close association 
between compulsive gambling and outstanding athletes 
being people who are drawn to action and activity as a way of 
dealing with problems a way of soothing and comforting themselves 
it is very natural for them to be attracted to sports they 
frequently excel in sports he said 
jean falzon executive director of the new yorkbased national 
council on compulsive gambling a research training and referral 
group said the study should not be used as an excuse by gamblers 
people are responsible for their behavior she said in a 
telephone interview from her home in pennsylvania even treatment 
programs for this disorder also suggest the individual must 
repay society for what theyve done it doesnt excuse them because 
they have this disease

the nations rate of death from breast cancer is 
increasing and its worse across the northern states although 
federal cancer specialists cant explain why 
the annual death rate from breast cancer in the united states in 
1986 the latest year available was 328 per 100000 women up 5 
percent from 1979s 311 the national centers for disease control 
reported thursday 
the mortality rate in 1986 was 12 percent higher for black women 
than for white women 
breast cancer killed 40534 women in the united states in 1986 
the cdc said still the disease is survivable in most cases the 
national cancer institute estimates that 75 percent of breast cancer 
patients live at least another five years 
the cdc said delaware with an annual breast cancer death rate of 
41 per 100000 women had a rate nearly double that of hawaii which 
was lowest at 23 per 100000 
each of the dozen states with the highest rates was in the 
northern half of the country in contrast all but three of the 
bottom dozen were in the south or southwest 
we dont know why that is said dr robert hahn a cancer 
specialist with the atlantabased cdc it likely has something to 
do with the distribution of risk factors for breast cancer but we 
dont know which ones those are 
overall breast cancer death rates have increased for women born 
in each succeeding decade in this century for example hahn said 
women born in the 1930s are showing a higher rate than those born in 
the 20s whose rate was higher than those born in the teens 
that trend is apparently continuing hahn said although many 
women born in this century are just entering or havent yet 
entered their years of greatest risk for breast cancer the cdc 
said more than half of all breast cancer deaths occur in women 65 or 
older 
breast cancers risk factors include family history and 
childbearing at older ages another possible risk factor is a diet 
high in animal fat hahn said although some researchers question 
that 
cdc researchers believe at least 19 percent of the deaths 
attributed to breast cancer could have been prevented if the victims 
had undergone recommended mammograms which screen for breast cancer 
women are seven times more likely to have mammograms if their 
doctor urges it but hahn said that as many as nine out of 10 
doctors dont follow the american cancer societys advice and 
recommend the procedure 
we think its crucial for physicians to become informed of the 
guidelines and recommend to their patients that they get screening 
mammograms he said 
the american cancer society recommends that women 40 and over 
have a breast exam every year women 4049 also should have 
mammograms every year or two and the society advises that women 50 
and older should have mammograms each year 
previous studies cited by the cdc have indicated that fewer than 
three in 10 eligible women reported having a mammogram in the 
previous year and nearly half of women surveyed said no 
professional had ever recommended they get a mammogram

opposition leader kim daejung and two 
other opposition lawmakers were indicted today on charges connected 
with a lawmakers secret and illegal trip to communist north korea 
kim head of the party for peace and democracy denounced the 
indictments as political persecution and said all the charges 
against him and others were fabricated to discredit his opposition 
group 
i have nothing to fear i will squarely face trial he told 
supporters 
also today leftist students students yelling yankee go home 
and overthrow president roh taewoo battled riot police with 
iron bars clubs firebombs and rocks 
police firing tear gas from two armored vans clashed with about 
l000 students inside seoul national university after the 
demonstrators tried to march from the campus 
students demanded the withdrawal of 43000 us troops which 
they claim hinder talks on unification with north korea they also 
demanded the release of a radical female student who was jailed 
after making an unauthorized trip to north korea 
also today about 400 radical students at seouls hankuk 
university of foreign studies battled police for two hours with 
firebombs 
no arrests or injuries were reported in the protests 
prosecutors charged in the indictments that kim and two party 
lawmakers failed to report national assemblyman suh kyungwons 
secret trip to north korea last year a violation of national 
security laws 
the three indicted politicians will not be jailed pending trial 
prosecutors said if convicted kim party floor leader kim wonki 
and rep lee chulyong could be sentenced to up to five years in 
prison 
kim daejung said his trial may never take place because the 
government knows it has no chance of winning the case 
suh was expelled from the party on june 28 the same day he was 
arrested on charges of espionage violating a ban on unauthorized 
travel to north korea and receiving 120000 from north korean 
agents before and during his secret trip to pyongyang last august 
prosecutors said they have evidence kim daejung knew about suhs 
trip in advance the opposition leader denies the charge 
kim daejung 64 also was charged with violating the foreign 
currency control law for allegedly receiving 10000 from suh who 
is said to have received it from north korean agents 
however prosecutors said the opposition leader apparently did 
not know the money came from north korea so the charge was limited 
to a minor violation that requires anyone receiving foreign currency 
to report it within 10 days 
kim daejung said his party will hold a rally in the western city 
of bupyong on saturday to protest what he called deliberate 
political persecution 
the seoul government prohibits unauthorized travel to north korea 
also today a seoul appellate court reduced the sentence given to 
the brother of former president chun doohwan to two years in prison 
and a fine of 477000 for embezzlement 
chun kihwan 55 was arrested last year for diverting 43 
million in public money after he took over a seoul fish market in 
1985 with the help of government officials 
he was convicted by a seoul district court and sentenced to four 
years imprisonment and a fine of 15 million he appealed the 
guilty verdict 
about a dozen members of chun doohwans family have been linked 
to corruption since he left office last year after a sevenyear rule 
the former president himself went into rural exile late last year 
after publicly apologizing for corruption committed under his 
administration

would remain close 
after polands lower house of parliament elected tadeusz 
mazowiecki to the post thursday president bush promised our 
strong support as mazowiecki seeks to lead his country toward 
economic recovery and democratic change 
bush praised communist president wojciech jaruzelskis 
political wisdom in endorsing a government reflecting the genuine 
will of the polish people and solidarity under the leadership of 
lech walesa for its constructive role in helping bring about a new 
beginning in poland 
danish prime minister poul schlueter who was visiting bush 
said you are seeing right now very positive and exciting 
international developments 
but communist vietnam criticized the new government today 
condemning antisocialist forces backed and abetted by the united 
states and the west for fomenting a deep political crisis in 
poland 
a transcript of a commentary in the communist party newspaper 
nhan danh seen in bangkok said a fierce struggle was going on in 
poland between revolutionary and prosocialist forces and 
counterrevolutionary and antisocialist forces 
taking advantage of the increasing economic political 
difficulties deliberately caused and aggravated by themselves the 
opposition aided by the united states and the west as well as 
the roman catholic church has been carrying out hectic activities 
blaming the communist party and poland for the troubles and trying 
to increase their influence on the people it said 
it said the complicated struggle in poland will rally the 
working class to fight antisocialist forces and resolve the 
present crisis

friendship and allround cooperation between the soviet union and 
poland will continue developing on the basis of sovereign equality 
and respect mutual benefit and mutual responsibility 
west german chancellor helmut kohl sent heartfelt best wishes 
to mazowieck i wish gods blessing on the tasks lying ahead 
of you kohl said 
he said added his government would do all in its power to 
support you on the chosen path 
kohl said he hoped for closer relations with poland especially 
since 1989 is the 50th anniversary of nazi germanys invasion of 
poland and the start of world war ii 
i am convinced that our two countries in this year should 
move closer together to smooth the way for a lasting 
reconciliation between our two peoples he wrote 
british prime minister margaret thatchers message recalled 
with much pleasure her meeting with mazowiecki in november when 
she visited walesa and his colleagues in gdansk poland 
her office said she reaffirmed britains readiness to help 
poland to achieve democracy and economic recovery but listed what 
she saw as the three main challenges facing poland the need to 
form a government that truly reflects the will of the polish people 
to take poland along the path of democracy to implement the 
difficult decisions necessary to restore polands economic health 
swedish prime minister ingvar carlsson welcomed the latest 
development in the democratic process in poland 
the new polish government it is true has no easy task he

rep barney frank dmass who publicly 
acknowledged his homosexuality two years ago insists his sexual 
preference is not relevant to the way he performs his job in 
congress 
if you ask the direct question are you gay the answer is 
yes so what frank said in may 1987 when he became the second 
member of congress to discuss his homosexuality in public gerry 
studds a fellow massachusetts democrat also is an acknowledged 
homosexual 
i dont think my sex life is relevant to my job frank said 
at the time but on the other hand i dont want to leave the 
impression that im embarrassed about my life 
frank a fiveterm congressman acknowledged today that he hired 
a male prostitute as a personal employee but fired him after 
becoming suspicious the man was selling sex from franks home on 
capitol hill 
the lawmaker said he met the man in 1985 through an 
escortmodel advertisement in a washington gay newspaper he 
admitted having paid for sex with the man but said the relationship 
later became one of friendship 
frank said he showed poor judgment in hiring the man but had 
no direct proof the man was engaging in prostitution from the 
congressmans apartment 
the liberal democrat said he saw no reason why he should resign 
from congress or should not seek reelection in 1990 
frank 49 was first elected to congress in 1980 and reelected 
in massachusetts 4th congressional district in november 1988 by a 
70 percent to 30 percent margin over his republican opponent 
deborah tucker 
frank who is not married contended in june 1987 that most of 
his constituents dont care that hes homosexual 
hardly anyone is interested in the sex life of a boring 
middleaged politician frank said as long as a person is kind 
loving and caring not much else matters 
in february 1988 he said voters care about performance in 
office not about personal issues such as sexual preference 
but his homosexuality became enmeshed in controversy this summer 
when the republican national committee mailed a memo comparing his 
voting record with that of new house speaker thomas s foley 
the memo titled tom foley out of the liberal closet said 
foleys voting record was as liberal as franks 
frank contended the memo was extraordinarily scurrilous and 
implied he viewed it as an effort to portray foley as homosexual 
frank said he might reveal the identity of homosexual republican 
congressmen if such attacks on democrats continued 
the rnc aide who wrote the memo resigned and rnc chairman lee 
atwater apologized to foley 
frank said he decided to acknowledge his homosexuality after 
public scrutiny of the private lives of former democratic 
presidential candidate gary hart and the late us rep stewart b 
mckinney of connecticut hart who is married was forced to 
withdraw from the 1988 race after being linked with model donna 
rice mckinney died of aids in 1987 
frank has worked for approval of legislation requiring 
replacement of lowincome housing demolished under urban renewal a 
bill requiring special prosecutors to investigate alleged wrongdoing 
by public officials and legislation barring the government from 
denying visas based on politics 
we would have more money for health issues if it werent for 
increased defense spending said frank in july 1988 
regarding antiabortion activists he once said sure theyre 
prolife they believe that life begins at conception and ends at 
birth 
he also contended the reagan administration ignored the aids 
issue 
frank is a member of the house government operations subcommittee 
on housing and employment which is investigating the 
influencepeddling scandal at the department of housing and urban 
development 
born in bayonne nj frank was executive assistant to boston 
mayor kevin white and an administrative assistant to rep michael j 
harrington dmass before being elected to the massachusetts house 
of representatives in 1973 
he served in the state legislature until he was elected to 
congress 
frank earned his bachelors degree from harvard in 1962 and his 
law degree in 1977 from harvard law school

a florida woman was jailed for two days 
and her sons were put into a foster home when authorities in two 
states mistook her for a west virginia woman who fled with her two 
sons after losing a custody battle 
not only do melissa dobbins of clewiston and her 8 and 
6yearold sons bear striking resemblances to lori butcher and her 
children but the boys have the same names joe and nathan and 
are about the same age west virginia police said 
mrs butcher disappeared with her two sons from huntington 
wva two years ago in defiance of a court order awarding the sons 
custody to their father 
mrs dobbins a largeboned woman with a southern accent and 
light brown hair matches mrs butchers description 
im still not believing it happened mrs dobbins said 
thursday after finally getting her boys back they put me through 
torture 
mrs dobbins nightmare began in early august a clewiston 
teacher spotted pictures of the butcher boys on a missing childrens 
poster noticed they looked like the dobbins boys and notified 
police 
clewiston police notified police in huntington confirming the 
mothers resemblance and the boys resemblance and identical names 
and ages 
huntington police then obtained a fugitive warrant from the fbi 
charging mrs dobbins whom they thought was mrs butcher with 
child concealment 
mrs dobbins was arrested aug 18 while visiting her husband at 
south miami hospital where he had undergone gallbladder surgery 
i said im not her im melissa dobbins mrs dobbins 
recounted they didnt believe me 
i dont think we did anything wrong to apologize for said 
huntington police sgt darrell black im sorry if we put them 
out we were going on police instincts 
after being fingerprinted stripsearched and booked at dade 
county jail she finally got to a telephone 12 hours later 
that was when she discovered that state health and rehabilitative 
services workers had taken her children and put them in a temporary 
home 
the frightened boys also told authorities they were making a 
mistake i was scared i wouldnt see my mom again joe said 
on saturday ray buck an attorney from tennessee where mrs 
dobbins once lived spent all day on the phone trying to convince 
the fbi and police they had the wrong woman 
police finally checked to see whether mrs dobbins had mrs 
butchers markings a butterfly tattoo and two caesarean scars she 
did not and police freed her sunday 
but black then decided mrs dobbins could have been a baby sitter 
for the missing butcher boys and the hrs refused to release the 
dobbins brothers 
it took two more days of legal wrangling including exchanges of 
photographs between police in huntington and in florida before the 
boys were returned to their parents 
the court system shouldnt work this way buck said people 
are entitled to better treatment than this

sales of existing homes rose 12 percent in 
july posting the first backtoback increase after high mortgage 
rates produced consecutive declines in the first five months of 
1989 a real estate trade group reported today 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
340 million units in july up from junes revised 336 million 
units 
junes increase was the first in sales since december 1988 and 
the largest since december 1986 when sales jumped 66 percent 
the downswing in mortgage interest rates is pulling some 
buyers off the sidelines said nar president ira gribin 
the federal home loan mortgage corp reported that average 
fixedrate mortgages fell from 1003 percent to 981 percent during 
july 
the realtors also reported the median price of a home rose 3000 
to 96400 a 32 percent increase over june and 63 percent over 
the previous year the median price means half the homes cost more 
half less 
the median price reflects the dominance of higherpriced home 
sales said nar chief economist john a tuccillo and a relatively 
low volume of sales in the lowerpriced starter range 
the loss of the entrylevel buyer is taking a bite out of the 
market gribin added 
but while the july increase in sales was small said lyle 
gramley chief economist for the mortgage bankers association of 
america taken in the context of all other recent economic 
indicators its got to be encouraging i think well see more 
moderate rises as the year goes on 
regionally sales were led in the northeast where the resale 
pace rose 98 percent to 560000 units next was the south which

angolan rebels said today that 77 
government troops and six rebels were killed in heavy fighting this 
week the casualty toll was one of the highest reported since a 
ceasefire was declared in angola in june 
in a statement released in lisbon the unita rebels said 19 
rebels were injured in the clashes that occurred earlier this week 
in the central and southern provinces of cuandcubango cunene 
huambo and south cuanza 
the statement said the rebels shot down a sovietbuilt mi25 
helicopter destroyed four tanks and several combat vehicles and 
captured arms and ammunition in the fighting there was no 
independent confirmation of the attacks from the government in 
luanda 
last week unita claimed government warplanes killed 150 people 
in a raid on mavinga casualty reports are often exaggerated by both 
sides and news organizations are rarely able to verify them 
a source close to the government said in a telephone interview 
that angolan defense minister pedro maria tonha would meet later 
today with his zairean counterpart along the border in angolas 
northeastern corner 
the source could not confirm the purpose of the meeting but said 
he expected an official statement to be released 
cooperation between angola and zaire has increased recently since 
president mobutu sese seko of zaire began mediating in angolas 
civil war before a summit of 18 african leaders at gbadolite on june 
22 
the summit produced a historic handshake between angolan 
president jose eduardo dos santos and unita leader jonas savimbi 
that sealed a shortlived truce in their 14yearold civil war 
the truce began collapsing one week later and was formally 
renounced thursday by savimbi he acted after seven african leaders 
met tuesday in harare zimbabwe and supported dos santos claims 
that savimbi had accepted a temporary and voluntary retirement 
from angola during peace negotiations 
westernbacked unita the portuguese acronym for the national 
union for the total independence of angola have been fighting the 
government and its cuban allies to force a powersharing agreement 
since shortly after angola gained independence from portugal in 1975 
unita was not party to usbrokered international accords signed 
in new york in which south africa pledged to halt aid to the 
guerrillas and allow angolas southern neighbor namibia to gain 
independence in return cuba began a phased withdrawal of its 
estimated 50000 troops from angola 
unita still receives 1518 million annually in us military 
aid

four young white men were charged today with 
being part of a gang accused of killing one black teenager and 
chasing three others from a white neighborhood with baseball bats 
the gang of as many as 30 white youths intent on preventing an 
interracial couple from meeting attacked the black teenagers 
wednesday night as they were going to meet someone selling a used 
car authorities said 
the killing of yusef hawkins 16 was reminiscent of the 1986 
howard beach case in which a group of white teenagers in the 
howard beach section of queens chased three blacks one of whom was 
hit by a car and killed 
in brooklyns mostly italianjewish bensonhurst section wednesday 
night the white gang gathered to waylay blacks or hispanics they 
believed were headed for a young white womans birthday party in the 
neighborhood authorities said 
police commissioner benjamin ward said the 18yearold woman had 
recently jilted her white boyfriend and had been dating black and 
hispanic men 
the spurned boyfriend had threatened the girl and made comments 
to her about your nigger boyfriend and bringing niggers into 
the neighborhood said deputy commissioner alice mcgillion 
the slain youths father stood thursday night on his own brooklyn 
street which is mostly black and laid the blame squarely on racism 
my son will never turn this corner again and its only because 
of this the pigment of his skin fred stewart said bitterly 
four young brooklyn men whom police believe were part of the gang 
were taken into custody keith mondello 18 steven curreri 18 
pasquale raucci 19 and charles stressler 21 were charged today 
with assault riot aggravated harassment violation of civil 
rights menacing and possessing a weapon said sgt norris hollomon 
the weapon was a bat 
mondello and curreri also were charged with conspiracy hollomon 
said police said none of those arrested fired the shots that killed 
the victim 
police said the former boyfriend was being sought for questioning 
mayor edward i koch with ward at a news conference thursday 
called the killing an enormous tragedy 
other candidates in new york citys sept 12 mayoral primary 
issued statements deploring the killing 
david dinkins in a virtual dead heat with koch for the 
democratic nomination said he accused no one of causing the racial 
violence but added the tone and climate of this city does get set 
at city hall 
hawkins and his friends troy banner and claude stanford both 
18 and luther sylvester 17 went into the neighborhood to answer a 
newspaper ad for a used car 
ward said the whites followed the blacks for about a block and a 
half and witnesses heard them say are these the ones is this 
them 
what they didnt know was that the girlfriend had told her new 
boyfriend a hispanic not to come and called off her birthday 
party mcgillion said 
mcgillion said the girl gina feliciano saw the killing from her 
window 
she knew there was going to be trouble there were rumblings in 
the neighborhood her mother had looked out the window and saw the 
boys with the bats mcgillion said 
when the white gang stopped and confronted the blacks four shots 
were heard hawkins fell with two shots in the chest banner had an 
injury to the arm but it wasnt known whether it was from a grazing 
bullet or a blow police said the other two were unhurt 
the gang scattered when police arrived they found four 
32caliber shells and several bats nearby no gun was recovered 
despite police searches of a parked car and sewers 
this neighborhood is definitely prejudiced they dont like 
blacks they dont like puerto ricans said joanne carretta a 
26yearold lifelong bensonhurst resident 
others said bensonhurst was no more prejudiced than other 
communities 
yet one teenage girl standing not far from where hawkins was 
killed said the black people dont belong here this is our 
neighborhood 
bensonhurst was the scene of a racial incident on christmas day 
1987 in which two black men were allegedly beaten by a gang of white 
youths while they collected bottles in a shopping cart two arrests 
were made in the attack which spawned a protest march through the 
neighborhood by 400 blacks as angry white residents jeered and 
shouted howard beach at the participants

police have arrested three people in the 
slaying of george adamson the british conservationist known as the 
lion man of kenya the governing party newspaper reported today 
the kenya times said police arrested the three men in the 
northern kora national reserve it did not say when the arrests 
occurred authorities began searching the area sunday after adamson 
and two assistants were shot and killed in an encounter with three 
robbers armed with automatic rifles 
adamson trained lions born in captivity to return to the wild 
the times owned by the ruling kenya african national union said

before adamsons workers who witnessed the shooting for possible 
identification 
police commissioner philip kilonzo was not immediately available 
for comment and richard leakey the director of wildlife 
management said he had no way to confirm or deny the report 
adamsons slaying was the third fatal attack in kenyas wilds 
since july publicity surrounding his death and the slayings of an 
american woman and a french couple threatens to harm kenyas tourism 
industry the countrys number one foreign exchange earner 
officials say travel is basically safe they blame the recent 
violence partly on a massive effort to save kenyas elephants which 
they say has driven wellarmed poachers into other forms of banditry 
adamson 83 earned international fame by his efforts along with 
his wife joy to return lions to the wild their achievements were 
detailed in the film born free and a sequel living free 
both movies were based on books by joy who was killed at the 
northwestern shamba game reserve in 1980 by a servant she had 
dismissed on suspicion of theft 
adamson moved into kora national reserve in 1971 and helped 
dozens of lions learn to survive in the bush before turning them 
loose

a former aide to hotel queen leona helmsley was 
unfairly charged in a tax evasion and extortion scheme in an attempt 
to bring down his boss a lawyer argued today in closing arguments 
he was swept up in order to get at mrs helmsley attorney 
william brodsky said frank turco was a man who was up front in 
the helmsley organization 
turco who was mrs helmsleys top aide and is now her 
codefendant is also charged with conspiracy to commit extortion 
brodsky discounted the allegation that turco forced liquor 
salespeople to make kickbacks to keep accounts at the helmsley 
hotels he called turco a toughtalking executive who merely 
negotiated rebates or discounts to get mrs helmsley the best 
possible price 
assistant us attorney james devita planned to deliver the 
governments rebuttal later today 
mrs helmsley 69 is accused of evading 12 million in federal 
taxes by charging personal expenses including renovations at her 
connecticut estate to her businesses 
on thursday mrs helmsleys lawyer spent eight hours dissecting 
the governments case against her then wrapped up his closing 
argument with an emotional plea for acquittal 
please end the suffering the terrible suffering of mrs 
helmsley and let her walk out of this courthouse a free woman the 
attorney gerald feffer said thursday 
mrs helmsley cried and appeared shaken after feffer told the 
jury it would be a mistake to vote a conviction on any of the 41 
counts on which she is charged 
he told the jury in us district court in manhattan that many of 
the prosecution witnesses who had worked for her had a motivation to 
testify against her 
mrs helmsley had a lot of enemies and these people came here 
to pay her back feffer said these people had an agenda and 
that agenda was to get her 
turco and another former aide joseph licari are charged with 
assisting in the scheme 
the charges against mrs helmsley include conspiracy to defraud 
the internal revenue service tax evasion filing false returns 
mail fraud and conspiracy to commit extortion 
the extortion conspiracy charge carries a maximum 20year prison 
sentence upon conviction the other charges carry three to 
fiveyear sentences 
feffer who made mrs helmsleys harsh personality an issue 
during the trial told the jurors to disregard the stories of her 
wrath 
if in fact she mistreated people i beg you ladies and 
gentlemen to leave that decision to a higher authority he said 
the defense attorney also brushed aside testimony from mrs 
helmsleys former housekeeper who said mrs helmsley once told her 
we dont pay taxes only the little people pay taxes 
he said the statement made no sense because leona and harry 
helmsley paid 578 million in federal taxes in 198385 the years 
covered in the indictment 
i can see her complaining about all the taxes she did pay that 
would be more like mrs helmsley feffer said 
on wednesday assistant us attorney cathy seibel said the 
statement showed mrs helmsleys selfishness greed and sheer 
arrogance 
after feffers argument joseph benfante licaris lawyer argued 
his clients innocence with humor 
he had the entire courtroom laughing as he focused on the tense 
relationship between mrs helmsley and licari 
joseph licari was mr helmsleys jiminy cricket his 
conscience benfante said hed tell mr helmsley shes spending 
his money again and shed go nuts 
he described licari as a respected trusted and honest employee 
he would not be part of a fraud even if there was one he 
said 
us district judge john walker jr said he expected 
deliberations to begin late today or saturday morning

the philippine senate will not ratify 
a treaty extending us military bases after 1991 without strong 
pressure from president corazon aquino a prominent opposition 
lawmaker said today 
the united states maintains clark air base the subic bay naval 
base and four smaller installations under an agreement that expires 
in september 1991 talks are expected to begin late this year on 
extending the agreement 
mrs aquino refuses to say whether she supports a new agreement 
which must be approved by twothirds of the 23member senate on 
thursday 12 senators called for closing the bases in 1991 showing 
the aquino administration lacks the votes for ratification 
the liberal party the most dominant political group in the 
senate announced after a twohour closeddoor meeting late today 
that it would oppose any extension of the bases treaty 
senate president jovito salonga the liberal partys president 
said his party will ask us officials to withdraw their troops and 
dismantle the bases upon the expiration of the treaty 
he said the party also will conduct a nationwide information 
campaign against the bases 
eight of the 23 senators belong to the liberal party making it 
the most dominant group in the upper chamber 
sen juan ponce enrile a former defense minister and one of the 
resolutions cosponsors told foreign reporters he believes all 12 
cosigners are strongly committed to closing the bases 
unless president aquino exerts her power and influence over her 
coalition members i think that the 11 will stay committed to the 
resolution said enrile the senates only opposition member 
for myself i know how i will vote and there are no ifs and 
buts about that 
the united states claims the bases are essential for maintaining 
security in the far east filipino opponents claim the bases are a 
vestige of us colonial rule and infringe on national sovereignty 
enrile said the resolution was aimed at pressing mrs aquino into 
notifying the united states that the bases will not be extended 
that would give washington time to relocate its forces elsewhere in 
the pacific and for the philippines to find alternative uses for the 
facilities he said 
i think that the 11 other members who cosigned the resolution 
with me seem to be very committed in what was stated in the 
resolution that the military bases agreement should not be extended 
beyond 1991 enrile said 
he suggested that manilas international airport be relocated to 
clark air base 50 miles north of the capital enrile said he 
believed the united states could remove its 40000 service members 
military dependents and civilian employees within six months 
in the resolution the 12 senators ruled out a phased withdrawal 
that would last beyond 1991 as called for by some filipino 
lawmakers 
whereas to be fair to all concerned the undersigned manifest 
that they are opposed to any further extension of the presence of 
foreign military bases in our country beyond 1991 the resolution 
says 
in october 1988 the united states agreed to pay 481 million a 
year to keep the bases until 1991 filipino officials had asked for 
2 billion and are expected to press for more money during future 
talks 
the issue is expected to figure in talks during mrs aquinos 
visit to washington in november the bases provide jobs to about 
70000 filipinos and pay more than 96 million annually in civilian 
salaries

rep barney frank said today he hired a male 
prostitute as a personal employee but fired him two years ago when 
he became suspicious the man was selling sex from franks capitol 
hill apartment 
i was victimized frank dmass said in a telephone 
interview with the associated press 
i knew he had been a prostitute i was trying to get him to 
stop i didnt know he was expanding his business from firsthand 
knowledge i still dont know that said frank 49 a liberal 
democrat who publicly acknowledged his homosexuality in may 1987 
during a news conference later at his office in this boston 
suburb frank said he had shown poor judgement in hiring the man 
thinking i was going to be henry higgins and trying to turn him 
into pygmalion was the biggest mistake i ever made he said he 
took me 
frank said he met the man in 1985 through an escortmodel 
advertisement in a washington gay newspaper the congressman 
admitted paying for sex with the man one time but said the 
relationship quickly became one of friendship he said he no longer 
uses escort services 
in a report in todays editions of the washington times a man 
identified as greg davis told the newspaper that frank was aware 
that sex was being sold from the congressmans apartment and was 
concerned that it might be discovered 
frank called those allegations absolutely untrue 
his suggestion that he was procuring sex partners for me is a 
lie frank also said 
when asked if the revelations might force him to resign from 
congress frank replied of course not why should it he said 
he planned to run for reelection for a sixth term in 1990 
i dont think im going to be heavily penalized by the voters 
for being suckered by a guy i was trying to help he said 
i hired him out of a charitable impulse i misjudged his 
character i think he was a pretty good con man he said 
frank said he hired the man as a personal assistant to do work 
around his house drive his car and run errands frank said he paid 
him about 20000 a year for about a year and a half with personal 
money he said no government or campaign funds were used 
frank said he fired him in august 1987 after his landlady told 
him for the second time that the man may have been arranging 
liaisons at the apartment in franks absence 
he was angry he threatened me with a variety of retributions 
and apparently he decided the way to to that was go to the 
washington times frank said 
in a companion story today the times reported that the principal 
of an elementary school in the welltodo washington suburb of chevy 
chase md acknowledged that he had allowed davis to use school 
offices in 1987 school officials placed the principal on leave 
after the story broke 
the prostitute told the times he used a telephone in the school 
guidance counselors office to arrange liaisons but principal 
gabriel massaro denied to the newspaper that he knew what davis was 
doing 
the newspaper said davis was a professional name and it did not 
disclose his real name but frank identified the man as steve gobie 
there was no telephone listing for gobie in washington or its 
suburbs 
he was a male prostitute and i thought that he was smart 
enough to do something else frank said i said he should get a 
job he said he was on probation and couldnt get a job because of 
that 
the times said the mans probation stemmed from four felony 
convictions in 1982 possession of obscene material production of 
obscene items involving a juvenile oral sodomy and possession of 
cocaine he also was convicted of cocaine distribution in 1975 the 
newspaper said 
i thought i could help him reform frank said 
frank said he wrote letters of reference on his congressional 
stationery to the probation board to verify that gobie was employed 
the congressman said he knew that gobie sometimes stayed at his 
apartment when he was out of town and that he told gobie there 
should be no drugs there 
but it never occurred to me to say dont engage in 
prostitution frank said 
frank said he gave gobie a couple of small jobs to do in 1987 
after he complained about having a difficult time finding work but 
fired him after he tried to extort me and i ordered him not to 
have any access to me 
paying for sex thats one of the things that led me to 
acknowledge being gay frank said before living as a closeted 
gay man was difficult it was one of the reasons i was 
vulnerable to being preyed on 
asked when was the last time he paid for sex frank replied 
im not going to get into that 
he did say he has been in a monogamous homosexual relationship 
for about two years 
hes a very sensible person and a steadying influence frank 
said about his partner 
franks homosexuality became the subject of controversy this 
summer when the republican national committee circulated a memo 
comparing his voting record with that of new house speaker thomas s 
foley 
the memo titled tom foley out of the liberal closet said 
foleys voting record was as liberal as franks the rnc aide who 
wrote the memo resigned and rnc chairman lee atwater apologized to 
foley

hundreds of video rental shops on friday received 
promotional kits for a horror movie with live snakes inside the 
packages and outraged animal protection officials called the stunt 
cruel and irresponsible 
the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals called 
on cinema international corp to take back the 700 reptiles 
the snakes were in danger because instructions accompanying the 
kits had incorrectly said they did not need to be fed for their 
planned monthlong stay in the stores the society said 
it said it was receiving dozens of calls from unhappy shop owners 
paul brett cics marketing manager said the snakes were 
intended to be kept in shops to promote a thriller about voodoo 
called the serpent and the rainbow 
the snakes were bred domestically and the company began sending 
them out thursday from its london headquarters he said 
the snakes silver with gray stripes are not poisonous but might 
carry harmful parasites if they came from abroad said rspca 
spokeswoman diana jones they needed to be fed weekly she said 
while admitting thered been some confusion cinema 
international denied the snakes would harm anyone or be harmed 
weve sent out 700 in clear plastic aerated boxes as 
conversation pieces brett said snakes make wonderful pets 
the 18 to 24inch snakes used in the promotion came from a 
company called animal actors which assured cinema international 
they did not have to be fed for three months he said 
lawrence cane cinema internationals marketing assistant said 
whenever we launch a new video title we normally send to our 
distributors posters sleeves and cardboard cutouts with this 
film we decided to send snakes in marketing terms its called live 
points of sale 
some recipients werent impressed 
we felt complete and utter horror said a london video shop 
manager who refused to be identified to protect his relations with 
the distribution company i deplore any living creature used for 
advertising 
he said the snake which just appeared out of the blue had 
been returned to the distribution companys animal supplier 
brett said the snakes were handdelivered in boxes marked live 
animal and claimed shop owners were warned by ads in the trade 
press and calls from sales agents 
at the end of the month they were to be collected by the 
company although if shop owners were unhappy they could call an 
emergency number and have them picked up 
i have spoken to three shop owners who were less than 
happy brett said if we find we were wrong about feeding then 
obviously we will take action on that and pull them back 
immediately 
ms jones said the rspca was urging unhappy owners to demand that 
the company take them back and if they didnt the rspca might take 
some 
we dont have the resources to take care of hundreds of 
snakes she said 
robert cottrill assistant manager at video palace shop in 
londons soho district said he didnt particularly mind the snake 
whom the staff immediately nicknamed cyril but thought the 
whole stunt was cruel and crass 
its a pretty secondrate film he said i think they knew 
full well that all this would happen

sales of existing homes continued their rebound 
from high mortgage rates with a 12 percent increase in july a real 
estate trade group reported friday and analysts forecast continued 
moderate growth the rest of the year 
the national association of realtors said existing singlefamily 
homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 340 million 
units in july that compared with revised figures for june that 
showed a 47 percent increase to 336 million units annually 
the junejuly rebound followed consecutive sales declines in the 
first five months of the year 
although the july sales hike was relatively small chief 
economist lyle gramley of the mortgage bankers association of 
america said taken in the context of all other recent economic 
indicators its got to be encouraging 
i think well see more moderate rises as the year goes on he 
said 
the nar is forecasting existing home sales to total 341 million 
units this year down 5 percent from 1988 in part because higher 
costs are pricing the entrylevel buyer out of the market 
the downswing in rates is pulling some buyers off the 
sidelines said nar president ira gribin adding that the impact 
of lower mortgage rates is likely to be steady tradeup sales 
rather than a sales surge among firsttime buyers 
the federal home loan mortgage corp reported that fixedrate 
mortgages fell from a peak of 1122 percent in march to 981 percent 
during july 
the nar said the median price of a home in july was 96400 
which realtors chief economist john a tuccillo said suggests a 
relatively low volume of sales in the lowerpriced starter range 
the median price meaning half the homes cost more half less 
was up 32 percent from june and 63 percent from the previous year 
the single largest percentage 138 percent of existing home 
sales made nationwide in july came in the price category of 120000 
to 159999 the nar said 
regionally the northeast led sales with a 98 percent increase 
to 560000 units despite having the highest median price in the 
nation 147900 
it was followed by the south with a 31 percent increase to 132 
million units the median price there was 88300 
however the west with a median price of 138200 saw sales fall 
5 percent to 570000 units the midwest with a median price of 
73500 posted a sales decline of 52 percent to 910000 units

falklanders have mixed feelings 
about talks on restoring relations between britain and argentina 
which made their rocky windswept archipelago a battleground seven 
years ago 
most residents see negotiations as inevitable but many fear a 
deal that could cost them their british status the first round is 
scheduled for oct 1718 in madrid 
about 1800 people live on the bleak islands 300 miles east of 
argentinas tip the main occupations are fishing and grazing sheep 
on the chill moorlands 
i think its a bit worrying really said nancy poolehow 
far will they go if they carry on argentina will think britain is 
saying yes to a transfer of sovereignty eventually i would think 
mrs poole is secretary of desire the right the only organized 
political party it hs taken no official position on the talks and 
mrs poole said her views were personal 
charles keenleyside an elected member of the islands executive 
and legislative councils welcomeed the talks 
he said a briefing by william fullerton the colonial governor 
convinced him we are not moving into a situation where items are 
being discussed that are specifically against the wishes of the 
falkland islanders 
keenleyside added however that many people oppose any 
resumption of links with argentina and have deep suspicions about 
the negotiations 
argentina invaded the british colony which it calls the 
malvinas in april 1982 and britain sent a naval force that expelled 
the invaders in a 74day war that cost nearly 1000 lives the 
argentines claim the islands under rights dating from spanish 
colonial days 
attempts to begin talks foundered on britains refusal to 
negotiate the sovereignty of the islands they are beginning now 
because carlos menem argentinas new president agreed to set the 
sovereignty issue aside 
most islanders trust prime minister margaret thatchers 
determination not to negotiate the islands away but some wonder 
what will happen when she leaves office 
senior magistrate rosie mcilroy is grateful for movement 
im glad to see there are talks because it seems to me that the 
stalemate that existed before could not benefit anyone she said 
i do think some form of link with south america for the falkland 
islands is necessary 
issues at stake include shipping air and communications links 
with argentina all severed since the war 
many islanders want no connections at all they remember the 
decade before the war when the argentine air force operated the 
first regular air service to the islands and its ticket office in 
stanley was an intelligence outpost 
when their troops landed argentine commanders had detailed 
military and civilian knowledge of the islands 
britain and argentina ok shop owner peter short said about 
the talks then added falklands and argentina no 
brian summers commercial officer for cable and wireless said of 
menem this man is far too smart he is going to say all the right 
things to the right people 
by playing down the sovereignty issue he suggested argentina 
could gradually restore links of all kinds with the islands until 
the transfer of sovereignty became inevitable 
joe newell a former farm manager took the view that were 
going to have to deal with them sometime and lawyer kevin 
kilmartin said its quite obvious that britain and argentina 
should talk to each other 
kilmartin said he hoped britain would allow the falklands 
government to make policy in those areas of particular concern to 
the islanders 
among the thorniest issues is protection of fish stocks in the 
south atlantic where argentine and falkland fishing zones abut 
islanders also want argentina to stop influencing other south 
american nations to deny access to a falklands passenger and cargo 
ship which now may operate only to punta arenas chile

commercial bankers who successfully kept their 
deposit insurance fund away from failed savings and loans are taking 
their next cue from william shakespeare 
he who steals my purse steals trash but he that filches 
from me my good name makes me poor indeed goes the line from 
othello 
the bankers say the sampls are engaged in a sneaky scheme to 
appropriate the name of the federal deposit insurance corp fdic 
which once exclusively belonged to banks 
but james h grohl senior vice president of the us league of 
savings institutions isnt worried about the complaints over its 
letter saying thrift institutions can advertise they are insured by 
the fdic 
bankers are always outraged it seems to be their eternal state 
of being grohl said personally i think theyre making a 
mountain out of a molehill here 
legislation signed by president bush on aug 9 reorganizes the 
deposit insurance bureaucracy under the old system the fdic 
guaranteed accounts in commercial banks while the federal savings 
and loan insurance corp fslic backed thrift deposits 
each type of institution displayed the initials of their 
insurance fund in a logo on their door reassuring each depositor 
their money is insured to 100000 
the new law disbanded the fslic which was out of money anyway 
and gave the fdic jurisdiction over sampl deposits now the fdic 
manages two funds the bank insurance fund or bif and the savings 
association insurance fund or saif much as a household may have 
two checking accounts 
but bankers despite their own troubles with failures during the 
1980s in farm and oilproducing states were proud of their logo and 
didnt want to see it associated with sampls 
congress agreed that banks could keep their fdic logo and along 
with billions of dollars in taxpayers money sampls would get a new 
logo with an american eagle and a message deposits federally 
insured to 100000 backed by the full faith and credit of the 
united states government 
banks thought they had won the battle but now theyre feeling 
snookered by the us league of savings institutions 
on the very day bush signed the sampl law the league sent a letter 
to its members saying that although they could not use the fdic logo 
they could advertise themselves as fdic insured or insured by 
the fdic 
bankers went ballistic the independent bankers association of 
america headlined its weekly newsletter thrifts try to rustle 
banks fdic brand 
weve fought this one before and won what the league is doing 
is a sneaky scheme to get what the congress explicitly denied 
them said donald ogilvie executive vice president of the 
american bankers association 
on thursday the aba sent a letter to the fdic urging the agency 
not to devalue the 50 years of sterling reputation garnered by the 
fdic regulators bankers argued must forbid sampls from referring 
to any government agency as their insurer 
but grohl said such a ruling would raise a constitutional 
question under the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech 
after all how can the government prohibit a financial institution 
from making a simple statement of fact 
there is a serious issue behind the rhetoric savings and loans 
lost billions of dollars in deposits earlier this year as bad news 
mounted about their industry even rocksolid institutions had 
problems calming their customers bankers dont want the public to 
even slightly confuse their institutions with an sampl 
sampls counter that full faith and credit of the united states 
government means just what it says for both insurance funds 
congress just proved that by spending taxpayers money to protect 
sampl depositors they say 
alan j whitney a spokesman for the fdic said the agencys 
lawyers had made a preliminary determination its legal for sampls to 
describe themselves as fdic insured the fdic board will take 
the bankers objections under advisement he said

a counterfeiter who has spent about 30 of the 
past 50 years behind bars walked away from a courtordered 
supervised residency by forging a pass to a hospital federal 
officials said today 
william pops kerns 67 had been arrested in july on federal 
counterfeiting charges and was sent to the pretrial custody program 
at the downtown volunteers of america because of his age and poor 
health deputy us marshal mark robinett said 
on tuesday kerns apparently forged a pass to wishard hospital 
signing a counselors name authorizing him to leave the residency 
he left about six oclock in the morning that was the last 
time he was seen robinett said 
i think it would be safe to call him a career criminal 
robinett said mr kerns first contact with law enforcement dates 
back to 1939 he probably has at least 45 different arrests and 
thats that i know of 
most of those offenses were for forgery impersonating federal 
officers writing bad checks and counterfeiting 
the longest time hes ever gone without being arrested is eight 
years but thats because he was in federal prison other than that 
hes never been out on the street more than four years at a time 
hes probably been in jail 30 years out of the last 50 robinett 
said 
a nationwide alert has been issued 
weve arrested him three times for counterfeiting said 
raymond j yonkus special agent in charge of the secret service 
here hopefully hell be locked up soon 
kerns was arrested in july after secret service agents allegedly 
caught him making counterfeit 100 bills on a printing press in new 
castle despite his age and poor health prosecutors had asked us 
magistrate j patrick endsley to order kerns to remain in jail 
pending trial endsley disagreed and sent kerns to the less secure 
volunteers of america facility

residents of the soviet baltic republics 
are encouraged by neighboring polands bold steps away from 
communism as they probe the limits of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms 
as more than a million baltic residents formed a human chain this 
week to mourn the independence they lost to stalins tanks a 
halfcentury ago a poster was displayed in vilnius the lithuanian 
capital 
lithuanians and poles lets unite against the common enemy 
it was not clear whether the message was directed at poles living 
in their homeland or the polish minority in lithuania but there was 
little doubt about the common enemy sovietstyle communism 
the message tried to cuts across the border formed by stalins 
incorporation of the baltics in 1940 to emphasize lithuanias 
location twice as far moscow as from warsaw and five centuries of 
history when the two lands were united in one kingdom 
polands solidarity trade union capped its nineyear reform 
battle with the election thursday of one its leaders as prime 
minister the first noncommunist in that post in the east bloc on 
the previous day in the baltics residents held hands to mark the 
50th anniversary of a secret nazisoviet agreement that gave poland 
to germany and the baltics to the soviet union on the eve of world 
war ii 
although baltic activists stress there are many differences 
between their campaign and that of solidarity they say the groups 
experience is valuable 
vytautas landsbergis president of the lithuanian grassroots 
independence movement sajudis said in an interview that 
solidaritys accomplishments were important for all democratic 
forces in eastern europe like the movement in 1968 in 
czechoslovakia 
so far the kremlins reaction to the formation of a 
noncommunist government in poland has been calm taking the line 
that it is the countrys internal affair and offering to work with 
the new prime minister the response to the baltic movement has been 
harsh words against calls for independence but overall an 
unprecedented level of tolerance and even sympathy to their demands 
for at least economic autonomy 
some baltic residents especially the elderly who saw troops roll 
in 1940 to impose soviet rule fear the kremlin will again send in 
tanks and troops as it did in hungary in 1956 and czechoslovakia 12 
years later to crush the baltic democratic movement 
but others point to solidaritys victory as proof that force will 
not work 
peter sookruus deputy propaganda chief of estonias communist 
party central committee said gen wojciech jaruzelskis imposition 
of martial law in poland in december 1981 backfired 
poland finally faced bigger problems than it had originally in 
that sense poland served as an example sookruss told a news 
conference in the estonian capital of tallinn the polish 
communist party was willing to give up its monopoly on power 
zbigniew romaszewski a solidarity official who in a sign of the 
groups improved standing has become a polish senator traveled to 
vilnius and the latvian capital riga to join in last weeks 
ceremonies in an interview in the sajudis offices he agreed the 
kremlin would be unlikely to repeat the mistake and forcibly put 
down the baltic independence drive 
we couldnt be destroyed even if we were in prison the 
symbols ethos of solidarity are very important in the socialist 
bloc this was all preserved despite the imposition of martial law 
in december 1981 said romaszewski sporting a red solidarity pin 
on his lapel 
solidarity proved that it is possible to organize an 
antitotalitarian movement he said 
the senator said gorbachevs reform effort and worsening economic 
conditions in poland and the soviet union are forcing communist 
leaders to realize they must put up with opposition groups and 
democracy and that the kremlin must allow poland and the baltics to 
settle their problems without interference 
while they reject kremlin meddling activists on both sides 
welcome cooperation between the democratic movements 
algis cekuolis a member of sajudis ruling council said 
solidarity leader lech walesa has promised to travel to lithuania 
this fall to try to help sajudis persuade the republics polish 
minority to join the group in fighting for independence 
poles representing about 8 percent of lithuanias population 
are more aligned with russians than lithuanians and have formed a 
political group unity to fight for their own rights so far the 
poles are concerned about sajudis lithuanian nationalism 
but while they see a future of cooperation many lithuanians say 
they and the poles are too different to copy each others tactics 
everybody has their own way said raimonda kaminskiene an 
english teacher interviewed at a proindependence rally in vilnius 
we are not so quick in our character we are more northern more 
scandinavian we always have to think what we are doing 
she then quoted a lithuanian saying about sewing similar to one 
in russian to underscore the point you have to think nine times 
and the 10th you have to cut

muffled drumbeats should be the loudest sound 
saturday when the naacp recreates in the capital the silent 
march a civil rights protest in new york city 72 years ago 
the protest will focus on the supreme court and its recent 
hostile decisions diluting affirmative action and minority 
setaside programs said naacp executive director benjamin l hooks 
the 1917 demonstration in which 8000 people led by web 
dubois paraded in silence down fifth avenue protested segregation 
laws and lynchings in the south 
the washington march also led by six drummers playing on muffled 
instruments is designed to duplicate the new york march in tone and 
style if not in crowd size 
the march will end at the capitol with a rally including 
speeches by hooks the rev jesse jackson and the rev joseph 
lowery head of the southern christian leadership conference 
hooks and other officials of the naacp national association for 
the advancement of colored people gave no crowd projection other 
than several thousand 
we are not looking toward bringing vast numbers of people to 
washington he said in this instance the medium is the message 
and the medium is the silent march

four years ago mayumi moriyama was excluded from a 
diplomats golf tournament she was holding because the koganei 
country club bastion of japans power circles didnt admit women 
the fact that she was vice minister of foreign affairs at the 
time made no difference neither would her appointment on friday to 
the highest government post ever attained by a woman chief cabinet 
secretary 
although the country club still is closed to women in this 
maledominated society the scandals that have plagued the governing 
party have created some unprecedented openings for women 
sex and bribery scandals and an unpopular sales have resulted in 
the resignations of three prime ministers in three months 
critically weakening the conservative liberal democratic party that 
has controlled government for decades 
with her new duties mrs moriyama 61 will act as a highly 
visible spokewoman for new prime minister toshiki kaifu and 
coordinate the turf battles among japans fiercely competitive 
ministries 
she will also act as one of the liberal democratic partys chief 
public relations weapons against japan socialist party chairwoman 
takako doi who also has skyrocketed in popularity amid the scandals 
involving male politicians 
kaifu tried to link mrs moriyama with the popular ordinary 
housewife image that helped propel many female opposition 
candidates into office in last months election 
mrs moriyama has an experience as a housewife as well as that 
of a bureaucrat kaifu said after appointing her i would like 
her to push forward political reforms from the standpoint of the 
people 
ms doi the charismatic socialist leader led a slate of 
candidates packed with women to a major defeat of the ruling liberal 
democrats in elections for the upper house of parliament last month 
mrs moriyama replaces tokuo yamashita 69 who resigned after 
apologizing for a muchpublicized extramarital affair with a bar 
hostess 43 years his junior 
kaifu himself replaced prime minister sousuki uno who resigned 
because of his reported affairs with women 
although seen as a competent and highly intelligent politician 
mrs moriyama is considered inexperienced she also is hampered by 
being a member of the lesspowerful upper house with only two 
terms experience and only a small power base in the party 
she assumed her first cabinet post just two weeks ago when she 
was appointed head of the environment agency 
the appointment is apparently aimed at bettering the image of 
the government said soichiro tawara a prominent political 
critic but i cant help thinking the choice was made perhaps a 
little too hastily and lightly she may be helpful in some ways but 
i am not confident that a politician with such limited experience 
can handle perhaps the most demanding position in the cabinet 
but if she lacks clout mrs moriyama enjoys general respect and 
her education and civil service experience matches that of her male 
colleagues 
as far as my near 40year professional experience is concerned 
i never felt any handicaps for being a woman she said after her 
appointment 
moriyama was one of just two women in a class of 686 that 
graduated in 1950 from the law department of prestigious tokyo 
university the breeding ground for japanese politicians she 
entered the labor ministry as one of its first female career 
officers in 1950 and was director general of its womens and young 
workers bureau from 197480 
in 1980 she was elected to the house of councillors from tochigi 
prefecture and in 1985 was appointed parliamentary vice minister 
for foreign affairs when her exclusion from the golf club became a 
minor cause celebre mrs moriyama whose official handicap is 26 
was never admitted to the club 
mrs moriyama commands greater international skills than many 
japanese politicians she is fluent in english and served as head of 
the japanese delegation to the un world conference on the womens 
decade in nairobi in 1985 
she has experience dealing in japanus relations and other 
international problems as chairman of the partys foreign affairs 
devision and as chairman of the committee on foreign affairs in the

disbarred lawyer william borders was jailed 
friday for refusing to answer a senators questions in the 
impeachment case against federal judge alcee hastings 
the onceprominent washington defense lawyer will serve his time 
at the federal correctional institution at petersburg va 
according to the us marshals office in washington 
borders surrendered quietly going through a back entrance to the 
us courthouse without speaking to reporters 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson ordered borders 
incarcerated tuesday after holding the lawyer in civil contempt of 
court at the senates request 
borders can free himself by answering a senate impeachment 
committees questions or he can wait for release until the senate 
votes on impeaching hastings probably not before midoctober 
borders refused to answer 10 questions from sen arlen specter 
rpa about impeachment charges against hastings a 52yearold 
us district judge from florida 
granted immunity from prosecution for what he might tell the 
committee borders was ordered by the court to testify but refused 
he argued that the questions violated his constitutional rights 
including the fifth amendment right against selfincrimination 
hastings is accused of plotting with borders in 1981 to obtain a 
150000 payoff and of lying about it to a jury that acquitted him 
in 1981 borders was convicted in a separate trial disbarred and 
served 33 months in prison 
despite the acquittal the house in august 1988 approved 17 
articles of impeachment against hastings charging him with the 
payoff conspiracy perjury and improper disclosure of information 
obtained from a courtapproved wiretap 
the committee will produce a report on the evidence against 
hastings and the senate then will vote on whether to remove him 
from the bench 
the questions posed by specter on tuesday ranged from whether 
hastings received any payoff money to the alleged relationship 
between borders and the late florida organized crime boss santo 
trafficante 
borders replied to each question by citing a statement he made 
july 27 when he also refused to testify before the committee the 
statement said the questions violated his rights 
borders also objected on the grounds that since specter was the 
only senator on hand for the session a quorum of the committee was 
not present 
specter however reminded him of a resolution providing that one 
senator constitutes a quorum for purposes of hearing testimony from 
borders

three teenagers have been charged with 
defacing the american flag raising constitutional questions in 
light of the recent supreme court ruling on flagburning an 
american civil liberties union official said 
the charge stems from a vandalism spree wednesday at byrnes high 
school in which two flags were burned paint was sloshed on floors 
books were scattered and fire extinguishers sprayed 
three 13yearold boys students at another school were charged 
thursday in family court with defacing the flag entering without 
breaking grand larceny and arson 
it has been illegal in south carolina since 1916 to publicly 
mutilate deface defile defy jeer at trample upon or cast 
contempt either by word or act the american flag similar 
statutes protect the state and confederate flags 
in june the us supreme court upheld an individuals right to 
burn the flag as a form of political expression under the us 
constitution 
police chief chuck shelton said thursday he was aware of the 
supreme court decision but said he believed he had to follow south 
carolina law as long as it remained on the books 
if they wont prosecute it they dont have to he said 
steven bates executive director of the south carolina aclu said 
the state flagdesecration law should now be considered 
unconstitutional 
the suspects ought to be prosecuted under property crime law 
bates said they werent desecrating the flag they were 
destroying other peoples property 
he said the aclu is considering whether to argue that the charge 
in this case is inappropriate under the state desecration statute 
solicitor holman c gossett jr said he would have to examine the 
case further before deciding whether to prosecute

a british communications satellite is 
to be launched sunday on the first commercial american space rocket 
the rockets manufacturer said friday 
the satellite marcopolo 1 is to be sent into space at 650 pm 
by a threestage delta booster mcdonnell douglas officials said 
orbiting 22300 miles up marcopolo 1 is the first of two 
satellites designed to transmit paytv programs direct to british 
homes equipped with a 12inchdiameter antenna 
the launch will mark a milestone in a commercial space program 
started when the national aeronautics and space administration was 
told by thenpresident reagan to stop launching commercial payloads 
after the space shuttle challenger exploded in 1986 reagan said the 
job should be done by private industry 
three us companies took up the goal in earnest the mcdonnell 
douglas delta is the first to the launch pad martin marietta has 
scheduled a commercial launch with its titan rocket later this year 
and general dynamics atlas is to make its debut next year 
all three rockets are upgraded versions of boosters that nasa and 
the air force have used for several years 
british satellite broadcasting ltd selected hughes aircraft co 
in 1987 to build the two marcopolo satellites under a 300 million 
contract 
mcdonnell douglas is charging hughes 50 million for each of the 
two launches hughes must verify that the satellites are in orbit 
and working before bsb accepts them

mountains 
two pakistan air force c130 aircraft helicopters and a small 
pia plane scanned the mountains for signs of the twinengine 
fokker27 until the onset of darkness and rains forced them to wait 
until saturday said azra sultan an airline spokeswoman 
the airline said the twinengine plane had not been heard from 
since it took off early this morning on what should have been a 
45minute flight from gilgit to islamabad 
ms sultan said most of the 49 passengers aboard were pakistanis 
but the list included an american paul mcgorrian a freelance 
journalist believed to be from st petersburg fla there were five 
crew members 
rescue workers in planes searched the mountains today but their 
effort was hampered by thunderstorms and heavy rains 
it was not known if the missing plane had encountered bad 
weather but planes generally dont leave the korakoram mountain

twelve railroad workers have sued amtrak 
alleging that passenger trains have dumped raw sewage on them while 
they repaired a bridge 
the workers claim in the lawsuit filed in circuit court this 
week that they have been sprayed repeatedly by raw sewage since 
1987 while working on a portlandarea railroad bridge over the 
willamette river 
they say they have suffered flulike symptoms from exposure to 
human waste and have extreme concern about working at that site 
the lawsuit alleges that amtrak has continued the practice despite 
workers complaints 
amtrak officials have no comment on the lawsuit said clifford 
black manager of public affairs for the national railroad passenger 
corp in washington dc which runs amtrak 
the lawsuit is the latest in a series of problems amtrak has had 
in oregon over its practice of dumping sewage from passenger trains 
onto railroad tracks 
the state department of environmental quality recently fined the 
train service 2700 and demanded compliance with an oregon law that 
prohibits such dumping 
black said amtrak would contest the penalty amtrak officials 
have said in the past that under federal law which they say 
supersedes state law they are not prohibited from dumping waste 
onto tracks 
florida apparently is the only other state that has challenged 
amtrak on the dumping said sherman olson of the environmental 
agency

taiwan and the united states today signed an 
agreement to regulate taiwanese fishing in the north pacific by 
placing transmitters aboard ships state department officials said 
the pact a copy of which was made available to the associated 
press is aimed at highseas salmon poaching by taiwanese driftnet 
vessels 
the agreement calls for transmitters that will fix the location 
of taiwanese fishing vessels to be placed on board by 1990 and 
allows enforcement officers to board the vessels 
the united states has accused taiwan fishermen of using driftnets 
to deplete the north pacific of its rich marine resources 
especially the anadromous species of salmon that spawn in the united 
states 
both taiwan and the united states ban salmon fishing in the 
region 
conservationists have criticized the mileslong driftnets for 
their incidental catches of thousands of sea birds seals and 
other animals 
we hope this will reduce salmon poaching doug ellice 
executive officer of the american institute in taiwan said from his 
washington dc office 
taiwans are not the only boats out there we hope this would 
be a model for the koreans and others ellice said 
the united states earlier reached a driftnet agreement with 
japan but is still attempting to reach an agreement with south 
korea 
tough negotiating pays off said sen frank murkowski 
ralaska i believe signing this agreement lays the cornerstone 
for an overall effort to secure our fisheries and protect a most 
vital resource 
the tentative agreement was signed thursday by david laux 
chairman of the american institute in taiwan and ding moushih 
taiwans representative in washington diplomatic letters to 
finalize the agreement were signed today 
enforcement of the agreement will fall to the institute which is 
the unofficial us embassy in taipei the institutes enforcement 
will use us government employees under contract to the institute 
ellice said 
yu yuhsien chairman of taiwans council of agriculture said 
the agreement was not an ideal pact for local fishermen but it was 
acceptable for taiwan

the bad luck with his boat follows even worse luck with rod and 
reel bush has yet to catch a fish despite going out daily since he 
arrived at his summer home more than a week ago 
bush on thursday blamed his bad luck on the commotion in the 
water caused by the fleet of seven or eight boats many of them 
chartered by news organizations that follow him 
fridays fishing trip was to be the first under an informal 
agreeement under which the chase boats were to keep farther away at

those slightly wacky kind of people placed an advertisement in 
the newspaper this week to commemorate the death of king richard iii 
of england who died more than 500 years ago 
yvonne mason paid for a memorial to king richard that was run 
tuesday on the obituary page of the news complete with his emblem 
the white boar and his motto loyaulte me lie which translates 
loyalty binds me 
king richard who was the object of a play by shakespeare was 
accused of having his two young nephews murdered so he could claim 
the throne ms mason a member of the richard iii society believes 
history dealt unfairly with him 
i think most of us the people who are involved in this are 
kind of those slightly wacky kind of people who just seriously 
believe in something and want it to be different ms mason said 
after reading shakespeares play she started reading books about 
the king i thought you know something is not right here this 
man doesnt seem quite as bad as hes painted she said she said 
friday that she believs the order to have the boys killed came from 
someone else 
the richard iii society claims 5000 members including about 800 
in the united states 
she has run her memorial for three or four years in the news 
other society members do the same in london and in other towns 
i think in the context of history its really time that hes 
recognized for the able and just and intelligent leader that he was 
instead of isnt he the one who killed those children in that 
tower she said

the antiaids drug azt apparently stays in the 
body longer when combined with a drug commonly used to treat gout 
allowing patients to use less of it researchers said friday 
if further tests continue to show the combination of azt and the 
drug probenecid is safe and effective aids patients may be able to 
significantly reduce azt dosages said dr david m kornhauser 
assistant professor of medicine at johns hopkins division of 
clinical phamacology 
kornhauser said the combination therapy could lead to a major 
reduction in the skyrocketing cost of aids treatment 
the national institute of allergy and infectious disease reported 
last week that azt delays the progession of aids in some 
hivinfected people who have not developed aids symptoms a group 
estimated at up to 630000 nationwide 
at the current cost of up to 8000 annually per patient for azt 
also known as azidothymidine treating this group with the drug 
could reach more than 5 billion yearly kornhauser said that cost 
could be cut in half with the combination therapy 
the hopkins study conducted during the first six months of 1988 
was published in fridays edition of the british medical journal 
lancet 
at this time were not saying that everyone should go out and 
use probenecid kornhauser said this is an important first 
step but we must continue with careful study before this therapy is 
widely adopted 
i think we should proceed to see if the combination works as 
well as azt alone because it would make it a therapy less expensive 
for patients and less expensive for the country kornhauser added 
probenecid apparently works by slowing the combination of 
flucuronic acid a sugar derivative with azt 
hopkins researchers gave the aztprobenecid combination to eight 
men with either aids or aidsrelated complex for three days and then 
measured azt concentrations in the blood they found that levels of 
azt were nearly doubled by adding probenecid so that patients might 
be able to take the drug once every eight hours instead of the usual 
four hours 
a second monthlong trial of eight to 10 people less ill than 
those in the initial study is expected to begin within the next two 
weeks 
well be studying this group to see how well they tolerate the 
combination over a longer period of time while looking for signs of 
toxicity which we dont anticipate kornhauser said 
he said the next step would be a trial involving at least 1000 
aids patients to compare the use of azt alone with the combination 
treatment

voyager 2 plunged over neptunes north 
pole and today took its closest look at the moon triton discovering 
dormant icespewing volcanoes and snapping photos of cliffs faults 
and glacierlike lunar terrain as the spacecraft capped its epic 
exploration of four planets 
this is it we are exploring new worlds laboratory 
astronomer rich terrile said after the 12yearold spaceship made 
its historic rendezvous with the outermost planet neptune is not 
a geewhiz sciencefiction special effects movie its a real 
place 
the oneton voyager probe skimmed 3048 miles above neptunes icy 
north pole cloud tops at 856 pm pdt thursday the closest of its 
planetary encounters after being accelerated by neptunes gravity 
to a speed of 61148 mph 
its photos of triton revealed that neptunes major moon has 
large inactive volcanic craters called calderas filled with ice 
instead of rock the lava flow is a flow of ice not of rock said 
voyager project scientist ed stone 
its the first time weve seen an icy volcano although 
volcanic ice flows without associated craters were detected on a 
moon of uranus stone said this is a real volcano 
we are witness today to truly an amazing feat of american space 
technology vice president dan quayle said today in a speech to 
hundreds of scientists and dignitaries at nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory 
reiterating president bushs july statement in support of an 
eventual permanent base on the earths moon and a manned trip to 
mars quayle declared we americans have been opening new 
frontiers throughout our history and we will continue to do so 
today space is americas frontier 
lennard fisk an associate administrator of the national 
aeronautics and space administration called the climax of the 
voyager mission historic because its the last time were seeing a 
planet for the first time weve completed the reconnaissance of the 
planets except pluto 
five hours after the rendezvous with neptune the spaceship made 
its closest pass by the moon triton at 210 am a flyby that was 
confirmed when signals reached earth at 616 am pdt 
the four hour and six minute delay is the time it takes voyagers 
radio signal to travel the 275 billion miles to earth 
the array of information on neptunes largest moon had 
scientists if anything more excited than they were about neptune 
itself 
triton will upstage neptune its filled with hummocky 
rippling terrain terrile said 
it looks like theres all kinds of fault systems all over the 
place said laurence soderblom of the us geological survey the 
faults suggest that triton quakes may have occurred at one time 
on the moon 
later joseph boyce a nasa geologist said there was abundant 
evidence of ice volcanism in the latest pictures he referred to 
volcanoes that once spewed frozen natural gas or other icelike 
substance rather than molten rock 
voyagers newest photos of triton received this morning showed a 
smooth feature looking somewhat like a dry lakebed that boyce said 
measured several hundred miles across 
it looked like it could be a crater of a volcano itself 
boyce said it looks like some sort of feature flooded by 
material and the material is probably volcanic material 
the voyager mission found similar evidence of icy volcanic flows 
on uranus moon ariel in 1986 and earlier found active 
sulfurspewing volcanoes on io a moon of jupiter 
boyce emphasized there is no evidence yet that tritons icy 
volcanism is currently active but said the smooth floor of the 
crater unmarked by meteorite impact craters indicates that the ice 
volcano may have been active within the last million years or so 
earlier bradford smith head of voyagers photographic imaging 
team at nasas jet propulsion laboratory had described tritons 
surface in photos taken thursday as extremely strange and 
puzzling 
the photos showed long fault lines ridges lowlying cliffs and 
ice structures of various sorts like glacier terrain scientist 
torrence johnson said 
while difficult to interpret the early photos of triton gave 
the same impression as if you stepped out onto some strange and 
alien surface with what appears to be a blue pink and white 
topography that is closer to flat than big mountains said 
smith who called the pictures just short of spectacular 
at 1159 pm pdt signals were received showing that voyager had 
been bombarded by dust particles up to 100 times a second as it 
passed through the plane containing neptunes rings said donald 
gurnett the particles each about a millionth of a yard across 
the size of the particles in cigarette smoke did not damage the 
spacecraft gurnett said 
voyagers safe progress through the ring plane prompted 
scientists to toast each other with champagne even before the 
spaceships near encounter with neptune smith said 
theres certainly euphoria he said we are all very 
excited 
scientists announced thursday that voyager discovered two more 
tiny moons orbiting the solar systems fourthlargest planet a 
60milewide moon designated 1989 n5 and the even smaller 1989 n6 
which is a mere 30 miles wide 
that brought the number of neptunes moons discovered before the 
close encounter to eight including the two moons detected from 
earth triton and nereid and four found earlier by voyager 
voyager also found a complete ring of debris encircling neptune 
although it was at first thought to be a partial ring or ring arc 
voyager photos also indicated a ring arc orbiting farther from 
neptune almost certainly also is a complete ring 
during its flight past neptune and triton voyager was programmed 
to shoot radio waves through the atmospheres of both worlds to study 
their atmospheres measure changes in distant starlight to study the 
rings and search for others and take its best but still 
29millionmiledistant pictures of nereid 
voyagers hectic schedule also included numerous measurements of 
neptunes atmosphere in an effort to understand its 400mph winds 
highaltitude clouds and its earthsized great dark spot and other 
cyclones 
nasa calculated voyagers position during the neptune flyby as 
nearly 275 billion miles from earth but the ship had traveled a 
curving path totaling 443 billion miles since it was launched in 
1977 and explored jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 
1986 
champagne flowed at the laboratory thursday when voyager crossed 
the supersonic shock wave where the solar wind meets neptunes 
magnetic field 
earlier pictures of triton suggested the backwardorbiting moon 
had meteorite impact craters and possibly glaciers of frozen natural 
gas on its pinkandblue surface 
using occasional trajectory corrections and engineering wizardry 
to aim a space probe built with 1960s technology nasa engineers 
said thursday they got voyager to within 20 miles of where it was 
supposed to be after the long journey 
not bad shooting said one engineer 
voyager 1 visited jupiter in 1979 and saturn in 1980 and now is 
speeding toward interstellar space just as voyager 2 will do after 
it stops studying neptune on oct 2 
neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun but plutos 
elliptical orbit means it now is closer making neptune temporarily 
the solar systems outmost planet 
someday there ought to be a pluto flyby fisk said but 
there are no active plans to do that

a judge friday imposed 15 years of probation 
on a cocaineaddicted mother convicted of delivering drugs to two of 
her children at birth 
jennifer johnson 23 faced a 30year prison sentence on the 
conviction under a law usually applied to criminals engaged in 
illegal drug transactions 
i dont have any desire to hurt you im not here to put 
you in prison circuit judge oh eaton jr told ms johnson 
before handing down the sentence which includes at least one year 
in a residential drugtreatment program she is now attending 
ms johnson is believed to be the first mother in florida and 
one of only a few in the country convicted of providing drugs to 
their newborns under a criminal drugdealing law 
in a nonjury trial last month eaton determined that ms johnson 
had delivered cocaine to her babies through their umbilical cords 
he acquitted her of a childabuse count 
the children a boy born in 1987 and a girl born in january 
are cared for by relatives and are described as in in good health 
but scientists have said that cocaine can cause neurological 
problems premature birth and even death in newborns 
justifying the conviction under the statute which prohibits 
delivery of an illegal substance from one person to another the 
judge ruled that a child who is born but whose umbilical cord has 
not yet been severed is a person within florida law 
other terms of the lengthy probation period included one year of 
strict supervision by probation officers during the rehabilitation 
program random drug testing at least once a month for a year 
educational and vocational training an intense prenatal program if 
she should become pregnant again and 200 hours of community service 
ms johnson a slim bespectacled woman with a ready smile 
declined the judges invitation to speak about her problem but in 
response to the judges question as to whether she believed she was 
getting some benefit from the drugtreatment program she said 
yes sir i just feel a lot of pressure 
prosecutor jeff deen who said the case would set a precedent in 
florida had recommended strict compliance with the drugtreatment 
program and lengthy probation he had called it a childabuse 
case not a drug case 
we want to send a message not of fear but of hope to 
drugaddicted mothers to take care of their problems deen told the 
judge 
shes used up all her chances the prosecutor said we need 
to ensure that this woman does not give birth to another cocaine 
baby the message is that this community cannot afford to have 
two or three cocaine babies from the same person 
defense attorney james sweeting who is appealing the conviction 
maintained again that his client should not have been tried under 
the drugdelivery statute he said the florida legislature intended 
the law for drug traffickers not mothers and children 
giving birth to a child we do not think this is a 30year 
felony this is not a criminal issue sweeting said after the 
sentencing the legislature has been usurped overridden by this 
court and this prosecution 
in explaining his verdict issued last month the judge said he 
considered the two children to be the victims because they had no 
ability to control what was being introduced into their bodies 
ms johnson was acquitted by the judge of one count of child 
abuse but other mothers giving birth to cocaine babies have been 
successfully prosecuted under that law which carries a maximum of 
five years in prison

state election officials said friday they face 
financial and other obstacles in trying to implement voluntary 
federal guidelines for computerized voting systems 
the federal election commission standards intended to guide 
state authorities who oversee elections are aimed at assuring that 
the computerized systems used in many states are accurate and 
fraudfree but a draft proposal has come under criticism from some 
public interest groups 
the state election officials voiced their concerns at a meeting 
of the 20member advisory panel of the fecs national clearinghouse 
on election administration 
ronald michaelson executive director of the illinois state board 
of elections said he expects that implementing the fec standards 
will require very arduous efforts 
i anticipate its going to be a very difficult task in 
illinois and a timeconsuming one he said 
dot joyce a florida election official said her states 
legislature last january passed legislation largely modeled after 
the fec standards which have been in the drafting stage for several 
years but provided no money for carrying it out 
since then she said weve just been really scratching our 
heads picking peoples brains weve been operating with no 
funds to put our standards in place 
deborah seiler californias chief of elections and political 
reform said election authorities in her state also lack enough 
money to implement the computerized voting system standards 
we will need funds to help us adopt that part of the 
standards which involves the certification process for computer 
equipment and software she said 
penelope bonsall director of the fec clearinghouse told the 
meeting the commission aims to make a final decision on the 
standards by late october she said that a 30day period for 
submitting public comments on the standards will run through sept 8 
public interest groups criticizing the draft standards include 
election watch a project of the urban policy research institute 
based in pacific palisades calif 
the first major inadequacy is that theyre not mandatory 
said mae churchill director of election watch the second is that 
there was virtually no sign of any public input into their 
creation 
there has been increased concern in recent years over the 
accuracy and security of computerized tabulation systems which in 
1988 were used in handling more than 50 percent of all voters 
ballots nationwide 
the election community is underfunded and underorganized 
according to lance j hoffman a computer science professor at 
george washington university with some exceptions it knows 
little about managing computer security few jurisdictions share 
knowledge therefore american elections are more vulnerable to 
fraud and error than is desirable or necessary 
the proposed fec standards outline in technical language the 
steps that should be followed by election authorities to operate a 
reliable voting system the latest draft was released aug 8 
the standards are to be voluntary because by law states control 
their own election systems computerized voting systems include 
those using punchcards marksense cards in which a person marks his 
choice in pencil on cards that are read by computer and 
directrecording electronic systems in which the voter pushes a 
button

kim daejung south koreas bestknown 
dissident said friday his indictment under the national security 
laws was an act of persecution intended to discredit his opposition 
political party 
radical students shouting slogans against the government and the 
united states battled riot police with rocks and firebombs in the 
worst campus violence for several months the protests were not 
inspired by the action against kim but were directed at the laws 
under which he was charged 
kim leads the party for peace and democracy the largest 
opposition group in south korea he said the charges were fabricated 
and declared to followers i have nothing to fear i will squarely 
face trial 
prosecutors charged in the indictments presented earlier friday 
that kim and two legislators from his party failed to report 
national assemblyman suh kyungwons secret trip to communist north 
korea last year the three opposition figures were not jailed 
pending trial 
national security laws forbid unauthorized travel to north korea 
which south korea has defined as an enemy country since the 
peninsula was divided in 1945 the two koreas fought a war in 
195053 but no peace treaty has been signed 
if convicted kim party floor leader kim wonki and rep lee 
chulyong could be sentenced to prison terms of up to five years 
kim said prosecutors knew they could not win the case so the 
three might never be tried aides said the government could 
influence the judiciary to delay proceedings indefinitely 
legal experts said the trial of suh the man who made the trip 
should be finished within six months it is to begin in september 
suh was arrested june 28 on charges of espionage violating a ban 
on unauthorized travel to north korea and receiving 120000 from 
north korean agents before and during the trip to pyongyang in 
august 1988 
prosecutors said they had evidence that kim knew about suhs trip 
two months before it was made public in june kim has said he did 
not learn of the trip until shortly before suh turned himself in to 
authorities in late june 
the 64yearold opposition leader also was charged with violating 
the foreign currency control law by receiving 10000 from suh 
prosecutors said kim apparently did not know the money was from 
north korea so the only charge was failing to report it 
kim who ran for president in 1971 and 1987 has denied having 
anything to do with suhs trip to north korea or his alleged 
espionage 
suh 52 was elected to the national assembly in april 1988 he 
was expelled from kims party after his trip was made public 
fighting was reported at two seoul universities after police 
blocked attempts by 1400 students to march into the streets after 
campus rallies no injuries were reported 
a main theme of the protests was the arrest of a radical woman 
student who returned home across the land border at the panmunjom 
truce village aug 15 from an illegal trip to north korea 
im sukyong visited the north in late june to attend a world 
youth festival july 18 she said her trip was a symbolic gesture 
for reunification 
at hankook university of foreign studies about 400 students 
fought police with firebombs and rocks for two hours before police 
drove them back to the campus with tear gas 
the students demanded the release of miss im and repeal of the 
national security laws they also demanded withdrawal of the 43000 
american soldiers stationed in south korea 
at seoul national university about 800 riot police firing tear 
gas from two armored vans blocked 1000 students from leaving 
campus the students at seoul national did not use firebombs

the bush administration on friday urged warring 
angolan factions to reach a ceasefire to end the outbreak of 
violence in the civil war there 
in order for there to be an effective ceasefire there must be 
a comprehensive ceasefire agreement such an agreement would be in 
the interest of both sides said state department spokesman 
richard boucher 
angolas unita guerrilla leader jonas savimbi on thursday 
renounced a truce that began in june the agreement between savimbi 
and angolan president jose eduardo dos santos was designed to end 
the 14year civil war 
the truce began collapsing the week after it began unita on 
friday said 77 government troops and six of its rebels were killed 
in heavy fighting this week 
fw de klerk south africas acting president and zaires 
president mobutu sese seko agreed at a summit meeting friday in

unita was not party to usbrokered international accords signed 
in new york in which south africa pledged to halt aid to the

secretary of state james a baker iii will sit 
out next weeks close of the paris peace conference on cambodia 
because of the lack of progress on a truce and powersharing 
arrangement the state department said friday 
accusing vietnam and its surrogate government in cambodia of 
inflexibility state department spokesman richard boucher said 
secretary baker does not plan at this time to return to paris for 
the august 28th to 30th ministerial session 
baker took part in the opening round of the talks that seek an 
agreement between the cambodian government and a rebel coalition 
backed by prince norodom sihanouk once vietnam withdraws the last of 
its troops next month 
boucher said there had been too little pogress on the central 
sticking point of the talks who would take part in a transitional 
government that will rule cambodia until free elections can be 
arranged 
prince sihanouk has demonstrated admirable flexibility in 
attempting to resolve this key powersharing problem boucher 
said unfortunately his reasonable attitude has not been 
reciprocated by hanoi or the phnom penh regime at this point 
therefore a comprehensive settlement is not in sight 
the paris conference under the sponsorship of 19 countries and 
the united nations sent a factfinding un team to cambodia to 
gather information for establishment of a peacekeeping force that 
would oversee the withdrawal of the estimated 26000 vietnamese 
troops and implementation of a ceasefire 
the united states wants sihanouk to head an interim government 
but cambodian leader hun sen rejects any participation by sihanouks 
main coalition partner the chinabacked khmer rouge the communist 
faction ruled cambodia in the 1970s and is believed to have killed 
more than 1 million people before being forced out by vietnam in 
1978 
us officials say sihanouk has offered the working groups in 
paris several formulas for powersharing while hun sen has failed 
to concede any role for sihanouk except at the head of a commission 
to oversee elections 
sihanouk believes that if the khmer rouge are left out of an 
interim government they will fight and endanger chances for peace 
us officials say but he is also thought to believe that a new 
cambodian government can eventually split the khmer rouge by weeding 
out and removing the most dangerous elements within the faction

the office of surface mining under fire in 
congress for allowing strip mining in a southern ohio national 
forest said friday it was suspending the mining companys permit 
pending further study 
the agencys new director harry m snyder suspended the ruling 
that cleared the way for belville coal co to apply for state mining 
permits on governmentprotected land in the wayne national forest 
the entire matter is on hold said snyder who wants the 
paperwork refiled and the procedures leading up the controversial 
decision repeated 
the critical issue is making sure fair and open procedures are 
followed in reaching a decision he said in a prepared statement 
in a letter to the coal company the ohio department of natural 
resources and the us forest service which opposes mining in the 
southern ohio forest snyder said indications exist that osm may 
not have followed its own internal procedures 
that same charge was leveled in june by rep nick rahall dwva 
investigators for the house mining subcommittee which rahall 
heads concluded the interior department agency failed to get 
independent documentation and skimpily reviewed company documents 
before deciding belville had a valid right to mine for coal in the 
national forest 
rahall asked the agency to freeze action on all pending coal 
rights claims until the interior department finishes the lengthy 
process of putting a federal standard in place 
snyder didnt respond to that request and the decision he 
announced friday applied only to the ohio case 
snyder said his action came as a result of his review of the 
overall issue of mining rights on protected land and stressed that 
it doesnt necessarily mean the ohio ruling will be changed 
in a reversal of a 1986 decision ironton ohiobased belville in 
december received a crucial bureaucratic approval saying it had the 
right to strip mine for coal on 5440 acres of the national forest 
so far the company has applied for state mining permits covering 
about 180 of those acres but the permits had not been yet been 
issued 
the forest service owns surface rights and manages the 
190000acre wayne national forest and vigorously opposes belvilles 
proposal 
it argues that the federal government should have followed state 
standards since theres no federal standard to apply when companies 
buy previous owners mineral rights and seek to mine on 
governmentprotected land 
the forest service also claimed the mineral rights belville 
bought in 1983 and 1984 do not specify coal mining but instead 
cover the stripmining of fire clay and any coal incidental to the 
claymining fire clay is used in brick making

president bush today authorized a 65 
million emergency drugfighting package consisting largely of 
helicopters assault boats small arms and other equipment to help 
colombia fight its war against drug lords 
violence by drug gangs threatens the very fabric of life in 
colombia white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said justifying 
the immediate aid 
the recent wave of threats by the drug cartel makes it 
clear it is time for the united states and other nations to stand 
with president virgilio barco against these insidious forces 
fitzwater told reporters 
fitzwater said colombias president had made it clear he would 
welcome us material and support 
the aid to the south american nation includes huey and blackhawk 
helicopters 18man assault boats jeeps machine guns grenade 
launchers other small arms and medical supplies 
fitzwater said no us troops have been requested by the 
colombians and he added the united states has complete 
confidence in the ability of the colombian police and military to 
fight the drug cartel 
he said us advisers would be sent to train the colombians in 
use of the equipment and said he wanted to emphasize we do not 
anticipate that they would be in a combat role 
the 65 million will be in addition to 25 million in security 
aid aimed at helping the colombians protect their judges who have 
been the principal target for assassination by drug traffickers 
according to administration sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity fitzwater said there would be additional money for 
colombia in the antidrug strategy unveiled by president bush on 
sept 5 
fitzwater said the 65 million would be drawn from a special fund 
available to the white house for emergency situations some 75 
million is set aside each year for such situations about 10 
million of which has been spent thus far this fiscal year said 
another administration official 
fitzwater said the equipment would arrive in colombia in the next 
week to 14 days 
the purpose is to get it there fast fitzwater said 
bush asked on the golf course today whether he would send 
helicopters or other equipment to colombia said were working on 
the problem theres a lot going on on that front were working 
to accommodate president virgilio barco were working now with 
his people in washington 
in washington the state department strongly urged americans to 
avoid travel to medellin the headquarters of the drug traffickers 
cartel 
spokesman richard boucher said the travel advisory was being 
issued in light of the violent campaign being waged by the cartel in 
retaliation for the government crackdown against drug traffickers 
boucher also said the united states was sending two bell 
helicopters to the south american nation today to help police 
this is an intensive and courageous effort on the part of the 
colombians and one in which we are happy to be supportive we will 
be happy to stand with the colombian government and people as they 
deal with this problem said boucher 
the thing they really need is transport equipment to conduct 
raids and ferret out the producers of illicit drugs that are shipped 
to the united states illegally said one source 
the apparent declaration of war by drug lords against the 
colombian government certainly heightens the concern about 
security both for the colombian government and for ourselves 
state department spokesman boucher said thursday 
the bombing wave dramatizes i would say what weve long 
known and thats that these drug traffickers represent a very 
concrete threat to the institutions of the government of colombia 
boucher said 
to help colombia meet that threat he said the justice 
department is moving ahead on a stalled 2 million program to train 
security personnel for colombian courts that are handling the drug 
cases 
and state department officials announced they are sending 
colombia 500000 to be used to purchase nonlethal equipment 
including armored vehicles bomb disposal equipment radio 
direction finders personal protection equipment and forensic lab 
equipment 
colombian justice minister monica de greiff was quoted in 
thursdays washington post as saying the us embassy refused to 
allow the colombian government to use some of the money to buy 
armored cars but state department officials said those remarks 
apparently were based on a misunderstanding 
boucher said us and colombian officials were consulting on how 
to best use the remaining 25 million appropriated by congress to 
help that country 
administration officials said the latest violence in colombia 
caused no injuries to americans or damage to us facilities and 
that they had no plans to withdraw any us personnel stationed 
there without such a plan the government would not even necessarily 
pay for travel of us dependents who want to leave boucher said 
the mission remained in a heightened state of alert meaning that 
the 100 us officials at the embassy in bogota and two dozen drug 
enforcement administration agents there kept low profiles officials 
said 
the bombings followed a drug crackdown inspired by the 
assassination of luis carlos galan a leading colombian presidential 
candidate and an outspoken foe of drug traffickers 
the state of siege allows for quick extraditions of alleged drug 
traffickers wanted on us charges those extraditions ended 
abruptly in 1987 when the colombian supreme court under pressure 
from traffickers overturned the extradition agreement the 
traffickers have indicated that extradition is one of their major 
concerns due to their fears that they would not be able to escape as 
they have in colombia

attorney general dick thornburgh said friday 
that countries considering harboring drug traffickers who fled their 
native colombias crackdown should take heed of the violence 
plaguing that nation 
i think any nation around the world is certainly going to take 
notice of the enormous cost that colombia is paying for letting 
these criminals proceed to dominate the processes of law 
thornburgh said i would hope that any country where these 
individuals seek refuge will respond accordingly 
but thornburgh said he could not confirm reports that some of the 
drug kingpins had fled to brazil or panama 
as usual when youre looking for fugitives there are a number 
of reported sightings but i dont think i could give you anything 
with authority he said 
as for eduardo martinez romero the one person arrested in 
colombias nationwide sweep who the united states has said it wants 
to extradite thornburgh said the extradition proceedings have 
about been completed 
our hope is that we will be in a position to deliver over the 
weekend the necessary documentation to colombian officials 
thornburgh said 
martinez was indicted in march in atlanta on charges of 
laundering money for the medellin cocaine cartel reputed to be the 
largest in the world 
while colombian authorities have said they have arrested other 
people who are wanted on charges in the united states thornburgh 
did not respond when asked if the justice department was seeking 
their extradition as well 
other administration officials have said they are unfamiliar with 
the other people arrested 
although thornburgh and colombian minister of justice monica de 
greiff had planned to meet this week to discuss extradition 
procedures the colombia embassy in washington said friday that ms 
de greiff remained in bogota following an outbreak of bombings and 
fires in medellin allegedly set by drug traffickers who declared 
total war on the government 
the colombian supreme court under threat from drug traffickers 
threw out an extradition treaty in 1987 colombian president 
virgilio barco resumed extraditions last weekend in an emergency 
action following the assassination of luis carlos galan a leading 
presidential candidate who strongly opposed the drug trade 
meanwhile thornburgh said it was unclear what impact the 
colombian crackdown was having on the flow of cocaine from colombia 
to the united states 
thats hard to say the attorney general said the ultimate 
dislocation of the cocaine problem in the united states is going to 
come when people quit using cocaine

the mayor prayed on the 50yard line as 
10 protesters blew horns and jeered in one of the first gridiron 
confrontations over a court ban on invocations at high school 
athletic events 
mayor emory folmars prayer ended with six people being escorted 
out of cramton bowl for sounding airhorns one protester was 
arrested for struggling as he was led out of the stands 
folmar said friday his actions were justified by the response of 
the 5000 fans who attended the high school football game most 
cheered at the end of prayers by folmar and county commission 
chairman bill joseph 
i didnt know it was big news weve been praying at football 
games for 50 years i wasnt trying to make a point said folmar 
a conservative and former chairman of the alabama republican party 
but a civil libertarian said the thursday night episode 
highlighted the difficulty southerners have dealing with religious 
diversity and a jan 3 ruling by the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals the court ruled that prayers before schoolsponsored events 
violate the constitutional principle of separation of church and 
state 
on may 30 the us supreme court let stand that decision which 
upheld a students lawsuit to prevent pregame prayers in douglas 
county ga the ruling affected only florida georgia and alabama 
and was largely ignored until the supreme court refused to overturn 
it 
i am a southerner and traditionally in the south we have been 
so homogeneous religiously that people are unable to put themselves 
in the place of the minority said university of alabama law 
professor martha morgan a state board member of the american civil 
liberties union 
whatever the interpretation of the pregame ceremony it appears 
the issue will wind up back in court 
olivia turner state director for the aclu said a lawsuit over 
the prayers was highly likely 
were going to fight the charge of harassing police said 
jeff shannon 23 the college student who spent more than an hour in 
jail following his arrest on that charge at thursday nights game 
since the supreme court decision many school systems in florida 
georgia and alabama have expressed displeasure with the ruling while 
saying they would abide by it 
in childersburg on thursday night a group of about 100 people 
led fans in a spontaneous recitation of the lords prayer during a 
game between bb comer high school and childersburg high 
this week all across alabama radio stations are broadcasting 
prayers at 655 pm five minutes before most prep games start 
and are asking fans to take portable radios to the stadiums 
mayor folmar however decided to take it a step further before 
the season opener between robert e lee high school and jess lanier 
high he walked onto the field took the public address microphone 
and led the crowd in prayer 
we thank you lord that we do live in a free land a free land 
where we can pray said folmar bless us now keep our players 
safe 
in the stands the handful of protesters wore tshirts scrawled 
with sayings like the constitution rules and church and state 
dont mix police stopped them from unfurling a banner and took 
the airhorns because both are prohibited in the cityowned stadium 
said police lt robert hankins 
the mayor said the arrest of shannon and the ejection of the 
other protesters was prompted by their use of the earsplitting 
horns not by their opposition to him 
folmar argued his pregame prayer was legal because he is 
independent of the school system and the game was played a 
cityowned stadium that is the site for the home games of all 
montgomery high schools 
he said he would pay the legal expenses arising from the defense 
of any lawsuit over his actions there wont be one dime of 
taxpayers money spent said the mayor 
that was welcome news to henry spears chairman of the montgomery 
county board of education which was reponsible for the football 
game 
our position is that we had no control spears said we had 
control over the game but we have no control over the mayor

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki met 
friday with emissaries from the superpowers and solidarity leader 
lech walesa called on workers to refrain from strikes to avoid 
worsening polands dire economic woes 
mazowiecki met with labor secretary elizabeth dole senate 
minority leader robert dole and three democratic congressmen he 
later met with the soviet ambassador and west german envoys 
mrs dole said after the meeting with the prime minister that 
washington would consider new ways to aid the country but would not 
say whether that included additional financial assistance 
mazowiecki assumed office on thursday in a historic transfer of 
power from the communist party to a solidarityled coalition the 
first government led by noncommunists in the east bloc 
walesa who convinced communist president wojciech jaruzelski to 
approve the solidarityled government said in a statement friday 
that mazowieckis selection was the breakthrough needed to stop 
polands economic decline 
walesa said dramatic changes were needed by the government but 
called on workers to limit strikes to avoid causing further economic 
damage 
in face of so critical an employment situation radical actions 
of the government are needed at the same we must radically limit 
economic losses which are an ovbious result of any strike 
struggle he said in a statement 
we must save poland not at the cost of other people but 
together he said 
in a rare show of support that would have been unthinkable only 
months ago communist party chief miezcyslaw f rakowski who is on 
an official visit to bulgaria sent mazowiecki a telegram friday 
saying the new prime minister could count on the partys support 
in everything aiming at leading the country out of the crisis 
dole rkansas said mazowiecki told him he who helps early 
helps twice in other words this is very important now to keep up 
the momentum and let the polish people see some change 
but mrs dole was cautious about offering more financial aid to 
poland 
obviously we do have a budget deficit at home she said 
we will provide aid as we can when we can but there is already a 
very significant program underway 
she was referring to bushs 115 million aid offer made during a 
july visit solidarity leaders have been hoping for a 10 billion 
assistance package from western countries 
later the doles met for over an hour with jaruzelski mrs dole 
said they delivered a letter from president bush to jaruzelski 
congratulating him on his wisdom and his leadership in this 
difficult time this time of transition and the progress that is 
being made in forming a new government his cooperation in that 
process 
she said a similar letter was delivered to mazowiecki 
at mazowieckis meeting with soviet ambassador vladimir brovikov 
the ambassador congratulated mazowiecki on his election and 
mazowiecki sent greetings to the soviet people a government 
spokesman said 
mazowieckis election has brought reserved support from the 
soviet union 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said friday in 
moscow that soviet officials were happy to hear mazowieckis 
remarks thursday about poland remaining in the warsaw pact and 
comecon socialist economic alliance 
the sensible and constructive approach by the head of the 
polish government to these issues which have paramount significance 
for the peoples of the two countries coincides with our wishes 
gremitskikh said 
mrs dole said bush would soon send a team of us experts to 
poland to study what priorities such aid would take 
referring to unemployment that will result as inefficient 
industries are closed under economic reform plans she said poland 
would have to lay a safety net for workers as they go through this 
transition which obviously is going to produce difficulties 
mazowiecki also met us sens dennis deconcini of arizona and 
frank lautenberg of new jersey and us rep jim moody of 
wisconsin all democrats the three represent the congressional 
committee that oversees compliance with the helsinki accords on 
human rights 
deconcini called mazowieckis election a wager on freedom we 
cannot afford to lose and said he would return to the united 
states to support increased aid to poland 
wales in his statement appealed to striking railway workers in 
the central city of lodz to stop their protest 
i turn to lodz railwaymen to display resolve in stopping the 
increasingly dangerous strike in the region a strike action now 
has a character of a provocation aimed against the first prime 
minister elected at solidaritys initiative he said 
communist party first secretary miezcyslaw f rakowski who is on 
an official visit to bulgaria sent mazowiecki a telegram friday 
saying the new prime minister could count on the partys support 
in everything aiming at leading the country out of the crisis

the value of us farm exports is recovering 
much faster than was expected a few months ago and this year may be 
close to the record set in the early 1980s the agriculture 
department said friday 
as it looks now commodity exports will be worth 40 billion in 
the fiscal year that will end on sept 30 up 12 percent from 353 
billion in the previous year the new forecast up 1 billion from 
the previous estimate in may would be less than 9 percent below the 
record 438 billion in 1981 
the department attributed much of the gain of 1988 over 1987 to 
improved prospects for exports of cotton red meats and 
horticultural products and said larger shipments of rice seeds 
feed grains and grain products also are expected 
but all of the export value increase for 1989 over 1988 is due to 
higher prices the report said the actual volume of shipments is 
expected to be 147 million metric tons down from 1483 million tons 
last year 
the tonnage for 1989 is nearly 10 percent below the 1623 million 
tons exported in 1981 
preliminary estimates for fiscal 1990 the year beginning oct 
1 point to a decline in us agricultural exports due to reduced 
volume and prices for most bulk commodities the report said no 
1990 estimates were issued 
after rising annually for many years to 1981 exports began a 
general slide reaching a decade low of 263 billion in 1986 world 
economic problems and competition from foreign suppliers were major 
reasons 
the recovery has been accompanied by rising commodity prices and 
a tightening of global grain supplies including sharply lower us 
inventories because of last years drought and short crops 
shipments of grains and grain products head the 1989 list at an 
estimated 17 billion up from 127 billion in 1988 that included 
corn 65 billion up from 433 billion and wheat and flour 61 
billion up from 464 billion 
soybean exports were valued at 41 billion this year down from 
about 5 billion in 1988 
exports of livestock and livestock products were forecast at 54 
billion up from 49 billion last year horticultural products 
43 billion up from 382 billion 
cotton exports were estimated at 22 billion up slightly from 
214 billion in 1988 and tobacco 13 billion about the same as 
last year

a month before astronaut david leestma 
went into space on the shuttle columbia he got news that nearly 
prompted him to back out of the mission his pregnant wife had 
breast cancer 
at first i thought of asking them to find someone to take my 
place i didnt think i should go said leestma one of five crew 
members on the columbia which ended a secret fiveday flight aug 
13 
but patti is a very strong lady she would have nothing to do 
with that the muskegon native told the muskegon chronicle by 
telephone thursday from his office at the johnson space center in 
houston 
instead patti leestma due to give birth in december underwent 
a radical mastectomy while her husband finished training for his 
flight she then started chemotherapy 
when her husband launched into space from cape canaveral fla 
she was there in the crowd to cheer him on five days later when 
the shuttle landed in the desert at edwards air force base calif 
she and their five children ages 1 to 9 were there to greet him 
leestma 40 whose only other nasa flight five years ago included 
a space walk said he was eager to get back home 
it didnt affect my job performance or my fascination with 
space but well im glad we werent going up for a long time 
one of those monthlong flights 
leestma said he probably would pass up many of the special 
appearances and speaking engagements that usually follow nasa 
flights 
im not in a big mood to go traveling right now he said 
my place is close to home 
leestmas previous scheduled space flight the shuttle that was 
supposed to track halleys comet in early 1987 was canceled because 
of the challenger disaster that killed seven crew members 
just before leestmas flight this month his 7yearold daughter 
katie asked but what if you dont come back daddy 
i guess i didnt realize how the visions of the challenger 
flight is still in their minds leestma said she made me 
think why am i taking this risk 
he said he found solace in his answer 
the risk is part of my job he told her and i do it 
because i think its very very important for the country and the 
world

a soviet envoy met friday with the leader 
of lebanons christian forces in an effort to end the deadly war 
with syria a key soviet ally 
soviet diplomat gennady tarasov who later flew to syria 
described the talks with christian commander gen michel aoun as 
useful an aoun spokesman characterized the talks as positive 
also friday french radio said vessels from the us 6th fleet 
were anchored 50 miles off lebanon and that a soviet missile 
launcher was heading toward the mediterranean to join other ships 
already there 
the soviet government denied the report 
at the pentagon cmdr mel sunden said it was likely the iowa and 
another 6th fleet vessel the coral sea both were in the eastern 
mediterranean friday but he said the us activity was routine and 
the nations were not combining forces 
police said at least three people were killed and eight wounded 
in clashes in beirut friday in which syrian gunners also launched 
scores of rockets and mortar rounds at a 28mile coastal stretch in 
the christian heartland 
the new casualities brought the overall toll to 794 people killed 
and 2222 wounded since fighting broke out march 8 between christian 
forces and moslemallied syrian troops 
the syrians who have 40000 troops in lebanon control all land 
exits from the christian enclave and shell the coastline regularly 
to prevent resupplies from reaching christian units of commander 
gen michel aoun 
the soviet envoy crossed beiruts dividing green line for 
separate meetings friday with the maronite catholic patriarch 
nasrallah sfeir north of beirut then with aoun in the bunker of 
the devastated presidential palace in suburban baabda 
on arrival for the meeting with aoun tarasov who heads the 
middle east department at the foreign ministry had to abandon his 
car 500 yards from the palace and walk up a driveway blanketed with 
debris and glass shards 
aoun has been living in the heavily fortified bunker under the 
twostory palace for five months while syrian gunners shell the 
compound daily 
talking to reporters after his twohour session at baabda 
tarasov said we have just completed a useful exchange on the 
situation in lebanon 
the soviet government he told reporters was deeply concerned 
about the suffering of the lebanese people the loss of human life 
and the material damage 
of course we view his proposals positively an aide to aoun 
said refusing to give details 
tarasov earlier met in west beirut with acting prime minister 
salim hoss a sunni moslem who heads a syrianbacked cabinet 
competing for legitimacy with aouns government the soviet envoy 
later left for damascus 
syria is the soviet unions chief arab ally although the two 
countries often differ on middle east politics tarasovs meeting 
with aoun defied syrias rejection of aoun as the voice of 
christians and a negotiating partner moscow had cautioned damascus 
in 1976 against intervention in lebanon but syria considers its 
eastern neighbor within its sphere of influence and vital to its 
security 
beirut sources said the soviet proposal calls for stabilizing 
the security situation by halting syrianchristian clashes 
one source said it includes reviving the arab committee on 
lebanon which suspended its mediation effort last month blaming 
syria for the lack of progress 
meanwhile sheik sobhi tofeili a senior official in hezbollah 
or party of god said the proiranian shiite moslem group was in a 
state of war with the french forces 
a previously unknown group calling itself the organization for 
the defense of the oppressed pledged to confront the flagrant 
french military intervention in the internal lebanese affairs 
the group in a handwritten statement delivered to a western 
news agency in beirut said its mujahideen holy fighters are 
ready to carry out gods verdict in striking at western interests 
topped by french interests 
france has said its six ships off lebanon led by the aircraft 
carrier foch with about 2000 marines aboard is on a 
humanitarian mission to help evacuate the estimated 7000 french 
nationals living in lebanon if the situation deteriorates 
moslem leaders accuse france who governed france until 1943 of 
favoring christians in the conflict and that the warships are posted 
to protect them 
meanwhile the vatican said it was trying to arrange a visit by 
pope john paul ii to lebanon soon but that it could not yet set a 
date syrias moslem allies already have accused the pope of bias 
toward the christians

diplomats in sofia said friday that at 
least 15 people were killed in southern bulgaria in midaugust in 
clashes involving security forces and members of the 200000strong 
pomak minority 
the state news agency bta said the report was untrue 
in many places soldiers and tanks moved in to quell the unrest 
said the diplomats in the bulgarian capital who were reached by 
telephone from vienna and spoke on condition of anonymity 
they reported deaths in dobnitsa kornitsa and lozhnitsa in the 
blagoevgrad area and said other casualities occurred in at least a 
dozen other villages 
the actual death toll was likely to be much higher according to 
reports reaching the diplomats they said no report on wounded was 
available 
the diplomats said the pomaks ethnic bulgarians of moslem faith 
were protesting government refusal to give them passports to 
emigrate to turkey 
at least 310000 ethnic turks living in bulgaria have received 
passports and crossed to turkey since may when communist 
authorities said at least nine ethnic turks died in clashes with 
security forces in northern bulgaria 
the diplomats put the number of may deaths at 30 or more 
according to the sources the new disturbances started this month 
in northeastern bulgaria near razgrad and varna on the black sea 
where anger flared among the pomaks over the travel ban 
in the south disturbances took place both in pomak and in mixed 
pomakturkish communities said the diplomatic sources who 
mentioned the villages of volko selo ribnovo khostanie and 
breznitsa 
unlike the ethnic turks pomaks have not been granted passports 
turkey this week closed its border to the ethnic turks from 
bulgaria saying they want a formal emigration agreement with sofia 
before allowing more to enter 
diplomats said pomaks were threatened with legal proceedings if 
they did not stop applying for passports 
bulgaria faces an acute labor shortage with the sudden emigration 
of hundreds of thousands of ethnic turkish workers last month 
special regulations empowered authorities to draft labor from towns 
to the fields for harvesting 
reports of the unrest followed word from emigre sources that 
pomaks in northeastern bulgaria were conducting hunger strikes to 
protest the refusal to grant passports and the continued detention 
of six prominent dissidents

strikes in moldavia against a pending language law 
spread on friday and the southern republics government appealed for 
calm the official news agency tass reported 
it said railroad workers at bendery and four other stations held 
twohour strikes more than 90 factories were idled on thursday 
about 50000 people attended a rally in tiraspol to urge 
postponement of the law which would make the language of the 
moldavian majority the official one for the republic 
the presidium of the republics legislature said strikes 
increased the destablization of the sociopolitical situation 
it said the law could be considered only in a calm atmosphere 
russians ukrainians and other nonmoldavians say the law is 
discriminatory and would set moldavia on the same path of 
interethnic relations as the three baltic republics estonia 
latvia and lithuania 
pravda the national communist party newspaper said friday that 
no tolerance for minorities remained in lithuania an overt 
division of forces is now under way in the republic it 
declared 
it accused leaders of the lithuanian communist party who 
recently have joined calls for independence from the soviet union 
of lacking a clear program of local reform 
the moldavian strikes follow the pattern in estonia where 
nonestonians walked out for nine days earlier this month to protest 
a law setting residency requirements for voting and seeking local 
office 
protesters in moldavia also say the republics government allowed 
too little time for public discussion of the law before the 
legislature considers it aug 29 the draft law was published by the 
official press sunday 
leaders of the moldavian peoples front say the draft proposal 
does not go far enough 
yuri rozhgo a spokesman said it gives russian nearly the same 
status as moldavian he said the peoples front supported the law 
but would try to have it amended by the legislature 
rozhgo said the peoples front would hold a large rally sunday in 
central kishinev to press its demands 
moldavians make up about 64 percent of the republics 42 million 
people but are outnumbered in many major cities where russian is 
widely used 
in addition to making moldavian the official language the law 
would return the republic to the latin alphabet from the cyrillic 
after moldavia was forcibly taken from romania in 1940 the alphabet 
was changed to emphasize the soviet view that moldavians and 
romanians were distinct nationalities

without shedding a tear celester said they worked for us and 
we clean our own laundry

president bush said friday he will 
send 65 million worth of helicopters weapons and other equipment 
to help colombia in its courageous battle against drug barons 
who have proclaimed allout war against their government 
the first shipment a 20 million package of eight huey transport 
helicopters arms such as machine guns mortars and ammunition 
4wheel drive vehicles ambulances communciations equipment and 
antitank guns will be sent next week said presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
later shipments will include medical supplies 12 more huey 
helicopters a blackhawk medical evacuation helicopter assault 
boats trucks medical supplies and airplanes fitzwater said 
hours after the announcement a official who requested anonymity 
said discussions were still going on with the colombians about their 
specific needs 
fitzwater said no us combat troops will go to colombia but 
us advisers will be sent to train the colombians in operating the 
us equipment 
its not anticipated they would be in a combat role he told 
reporters accompanying bush on his vacation here 
our only motivation is to do as much as we can as fast as we 
can the presidents spokesman said we have a war situation in 
america let alone in colombia 
bush in a statement read by fitzwater noted attacks by the drug 
lords against the colombian establishment including last weeks 
assassination of a leading presidential candidate and said 
it is time for the united states and other countries of the 
world to stand with president virgilio barco during his courageous 
challenge to these insidious forces that threaten the very fabric of 
colombian society 
officials said colombia is most in need of transportation to 
conduct raids and apprehend the drug cartel operatives 
the materiel to be taken from pentagon stocks will be paid for 
with unspent funds made available through the 1986 foreign 
assistance act 
the act gives the president about 75 million in discretionary 
funds yearly about 10 million has been spent this year said an 
official in washington 
noting that colombia will get virtually all of the money left for 
this year fitzwater said since were using all the money in the 
fund it stands to reason we could have used more 
he also said that the united states has begun shipping a variety 
of military gear bought earlier by the colombian government 
including 20 huey and five blackhawk helicopters the state 
department was also lending colombia two helicopters 
the administrations 65 million aid package does not include 
those helicopters 
fitzwater said bush would propose sending additional aid to 
colombia in the sept 5 speech in which he will detail his 
administrations plan to battle drugs 
in washington senate majority leader george j mitchell 
dmaine said that he supports the administrations decision and 
that the united states must be united with colombia in the drug 
fight 
the drug problem will not be solved solely through the use of 
military measures mitchell said in a statement nevertheless he 
added the drug dealers cannot be allowed to prevail in this 
struggle simply because they are willing to ignore all norms of 
civil society 
the 65 million package will be in addition to 25 million worth 
of us security assistance to help protect colombian judges the 
primary assassination targets of the drug cartels 
on thursday a paramilitary squad run by the powerful medellin 
cartel declared it would wage total and absolute war on the 
government on the industrial and political oligarchy and others 
the drug lords consider their enemies 
noting that the state department on friday advised americans to 
avoid medellin 
us aid to colombia in fiscal 1989 was 296 million said state 
department spokesman richard boucher of that 6 million was in 
military assistance 1 million in military training 76 million 
in development assistance 10 million for the drug war and 5 
million to protect judges 
of the 5 million in judicial protection 500000 has been 
earmarked for armored cars and other equipment and 2 million in a 
program to train court security guards 
us and colombia officials are working together to decide how 
best to spend the remaining 25 million in judicial protection 
said boucher

voyager 2 brushed by neptunes north pole 
and photographed volcanoes that once gushed ice lava on frosty 
faultcracked triton revealing a world unlike any weve ever 
seen nasa said friday 
all we can say now is wow what a way to leave the solar 
system said us geological survey geologist laurence soderblom 
deputy leader of voyagers photographic imaging team 
the oneton space probe capped its historic 443billion mile 
12year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3048 miles over 
neptunes north pole thursday night then dove past triton the 
planets largest moon it made its closest approach about 23900 
miles above the moons surface at 210 am pdt friday 
we are witness today to truly an amazing feat of american space 
technology vice president dan quayle told hundreds of scientists 
and dignitaries friday at the national aeronautics and space 
administrations jet propulsion laboratory i am exceedingly 
delighted to be here on this very historic day for america and 
americas space program 
during its approach to neptune voyager discovered six moons in 
addition to nereid and frostcovered triton which were first 
observed from earth 
the spaceship also discovered one complete ring of debris around 
the planet and a partial ring or ring arc scientists believe will 
also prove to be a complete ring 
voyagers closest photos of triton were recorded on tape for 
playback to earth this weekend but those returned friday astounded 
scientists soderblom said they showed at least three volcanoes now 
inactive that once produced flows of viscous ice perhaps frozen 
natural gas or nitrogen ice 
the images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any 
weve ever seen said voyager project scientist edward stone 
while icy volcanic flows without associated craters have been 
seen on uranus moon ariel and some other moons its the first 
time weve seen an icy volcano stone said referring to one of 
the huge craters on triton this is a real volcano 
but stone noted that tritons volcanoes are filled with ice 
instead of rock the lava flow is a flow of ice not of rock 
nasa geologist joseph boyce said one of the ice volcanoes which 
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material measures 
several hundred miles across 
other triton photos showed long fault lines ridges lowlying 
cliffs and ice structures of various sorts like glacier 
terrain jpl scientist torrence johnson said theyre like 
things you see in polar caps on mars 
it looks like theres all kinds of fault systems all over the 
place soderblom said adding that the faults suggest 
tritonquakes may have occurred at one time on the moon 
also visible were some meteorite impact craters and long sets of 
parallel ridges bounding apparent valleys filled with icy erupted 
plastic masses he said the icy flows either poured down valleys 
or erupted from valley floors similar to what happens if someone is 
using a razor and slicing open the side of a toothpaste tube 
soderblom said 
he said scientists dont yet know the makeup of the volcanic ices 
and other ice flows or when the volcanoes last erupted 
earth and jupiters moon io are the only objects in the solar 
system known to have volcanoes that are currently active 
voyager also revealed triton has an atmosphere as predicted 
its content wasnt immediately determined but nasa said the haze 
might be like photochemical smog 
stone said the discovery that tritons surface once was 
geologically active supports the theory that the backwardorbiting 
moon about fourfifths the size of earths moon once was a 
cometlike sunorbiting object captured into orbit around neptune 
under that theory triton initially would have orbited neptune in 
a long ellipse but neptunes gravity slowly pulled it into a 
circular orbit making triton a semimolten geologically active 
ball for the first billion years after its capture he said 
by 9 am pdt saturday voyager will be 2753 billion miles from 
earth and 1385 million miles from neptune speeding away from the 
giant planet at 37847 mph 
the spacecraft revealed 400mph winds in neptunes bluish 
atmosphere as well as cloud streamers stretching thousands of 
miles and an assortment of storms including an earthsized cyclone 
called the great dark spot 
voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored jupiter in 1979 
saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 its trip to neptune followed a 
443billion mile curving path although the planet is now 275 
billion miles from earth 
voyager 1 also was launched in 1977 exploring jupiter in 1979 
and saturn in 1980 before speeding out of the plane of the planets 
until its official near encounter period ends oct 2 voyager 
2 will look back over its shoulder at neptune then it like voyager 
1 will head toward interstellar space 
voyager 2 is now past neptune and is continuing to press 
outward into the darkest and farthest region of the solar system 
nasa administrator richard truly said the voyagers are destined 
to wander through the milky way what wonders they will 
encounter 
lennard fisk an associate administrator of nasa called the 
climax of the voyager mission historic because its the last time 
were seeing a planet for the first time weve completed the 
reconnaissance of the planets except pluto

this years filbert harvest in oregon and 
washington is estimated at 13500 tons down 18 percent from 1988 
and the smallest output since 1984 the agriculture department said 
friday 
the oregon crop of filberts or hazelnuts was forecast at 13300 
tons compared with 16300 tons in 1988 the washington harvest was 
indicated at 200 tons the same as last year 
officials said filbert trees particularly of the barcelona 
variety were hurt by severe cold in early february during their 
crucial pollination stage 
as a result nut set is lighter than in 1988 the report 
said also growers report a largerthannormal number of blanks 
nut size however is up significantly from last year

an elementary school principal who 
admitted he let a male prostitute use offices in the building has 
been suspended and will not be allowed to return to work there the 
president of the school board said friday 
and in the narrow neighborhood streets that surround chevy chase 
elementary school in this upscale suburb of washington dc few 
people were aware of what went on for several months since gabriel 
massaro became principal two years ago 
massaro who was suspended with pay from his job after school 
officials read an article about his activities in the washington 
times on friday admitted in an interview with the newspaper he had 
a fouryear relationship with a callboy and gave him access to 
facilities at the school 
the prostitute who the newspaper said used the alias of greg 
davis was identified friday by rep barney frank dmass as steve 
gobie frank said he had a twoyear relationship with the 
prostitute beginning in 1985 
massaro was not at home and was not at the school on friday 
right now he is suspended and there will be an acting principal 
in the school on monday said james cronin president of the 
montgomery county school board so far as the children are 
concerned his presence wont be a factor 
what will happen in the future i dont know cronin added 
but i think it will be safe to say he will not return to chevy 
chase elementary 
debra wood cochair of the chevy chase elementary school pta 
said i really dont have any comment the matter is under 
investigation its unfortunate kind of takes you by surprise 
and its too bad 
the prostitute told the times he had used a guidance counselors 
office at the school usually in the evenings where he used the 
telephone to set up appointments with his customers he said he did 
not have contact with any of the children in the school which has 
students in grades three through six 
massaro said he did not know the man was engaged in arranging 
prostitution services from the building 
i knew he was an escort but i didnt know he was running an 
escort service he told the times i couldnt condone it from 
going out of here the school he may have done that but i did 
not know that 
the prostitute told the newspaper that the principal was very 
aware of what i was doing and what was going on 
he also said that on at least one occasion he performed a 
homosexual act with a client in the guidance counselors office the 
prostitute said massaro did not know that i had met a client at 
the school 
there were some afternoons where he just had nowhere to go so 
i would just let him come here to the school and just use the 
bathroom and stuff like that massaro told the times 
the principal said he ended his relationship with the callboy 
after the callboy had misused his credit card 
i just used very poor judgment what can i tell you massaro 
told the times it was just stupid i never thought it through i 
just thought i was helping somebody 
in an interview with a washington television station wusa gobie 
said categorically that no children were ever involved in any of 
his activities at the school 
he admitted he has been convicted on felony sex and drug charges 
in virginia and said he went public on the relationship with 
massaro and frank because he wants to sell his story to the 
entertainment industry 
people living around the school and massaros neighbors in 
rockville another nearby maryland community said nothing at the 
school or in the principals behavior offered a clue as to what had 
been going on 
none of them wanted to be quoted by name 
a woman who lives near massaro said her family and his are close 
friends especially after she and massaro both had sons die in their 
late teens or early twenties 
she said massaro and his wife had been nearly daily visitors to 
comfort the neighbor in the weeks since her son died 
hes friendly hes outgoing she said 
across the street a man said hes one of the nicest people i 
ever met the man said he was flabbergasted 
back near the school and a few doors down the street a young 
mother said her family had just moved into the neighborhood and her 
kids were to start attending the school this fall 
she sent her kids out into the yard to blow bubbles while she 
stood inside the door and read the story in the newspaper provided 
by a reporter 
then she rolled her eyes and said its just our luck

films currently shooting in paris until chouraqui and his crew 
were given visas to start work on his film miss missouri 
culture minister jack lang said he found the us treatment of 
chouraqui humiliating and unacceptable but did not support 
blocking us films being made in france because of assurances from 
american movie industry officials that the situation would be 
cleared up immediately 
both chirac and lang said in their statements they had been 
trying to get action from us officials since monday when 
chouraqui had planned to begin work but there apparently was 
opposition from the directors guild of america 
langs office issued the text of a message it said he received 
from jack valenti president of the motion picture association of 
america saying chouraqui would have his visa this weekend or 
monday at the latest 
the message said officials of the directors guild had agreed to 
end their opposition to a visa for chouraqui and immigration 
officials had promised quick action 
a spokesman for the ivory production said privately the 
situation has been resolved once people who knew what they were 
doing got involved the whole thing was cleared up were totally 
behind france and france is totally behind us

businesses public transport and 
government offices were shut down friday in a 24hour strike to 
protest a crime wave attributed to immigrants from neighboring south 
american nations 
the strike called by the chamber of commerce and backed by 
businesses and trade unions paralyzed cayenne the capital kourou 
site of the european space station and st laurent on the western 
border with suriname 
the chamber of commerce closed rochambeau international airport 
which it manages but police occupied it friday and forced it to 
open 
chamber of commerce president pierre prevot said the strike was 
called to protest a surge in burglaries crimes of all sort 
usually committed with violence and street attacks in broad 
daylight 
police blamed most of the crime on foreign immigrants especially 
from neighboring guyana and suriname 
in recent weeks a cayenne accountant for a forestry company was 
killed and robbed of 47000 in workers salaries he was carrying 
jewelry boutiques and food stores in the three main towns were 
robbed and burglars broke into dozens of private homes 
french guiana is a french overseas department or state on the 
northeast shoulder of south america 
about 40 percent of its 100000 residents are foreigners mostly 
haitian surinamese brazilians or guyanese 
prevot said residents demanding the government give more 
material for police and gendarmes to help them better control 
foreign workers 
he said in a statement that if authorities fail to act 
citizens will create militias to patrol towns and protect 
ourselves 
immigrants and illegal aliens have flocked here in recent years 
to work in the lumber industry and raising shrimp or in the case 
of an estimated 10000 surinamese to escape army repression 
the only prison in cayenne a town of 45000 is filled with 
inmates mostly from guyana and suriname

several nations were drawing up a new powersharing 
proposal friday in hopes of breaking a deadlock at the international 
conference on cambodia but there was no sign of agreement among 
cambodian factions 
secretary of state james baker will not participate in next 
weeks threeday closing session the state department said and it 
was not clear how many other foreign ministers from the 19 countries 
attending would be there 
state department spokesman richard boucher said in washington 
that a comprehensive settlement is not in sight after a month of 
meetings because vietnam and the cambodian government it sponsors 
had not shown flexibility 
the gap on major issues remains rather substantial a western 
delegate said privately it does not appear likely the conference 
will achieve its objectives 
it was called to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive 
settlement of the civil war in cambodia which began when vietnam 
invaded in december 1978 and ousted pol pots genocidal khmer rouge 
government vietnam says all its forces will be withdrawn next month 
the khmer rouge is the strongest faction in the guerrilla 
alliance led by prince norodom sihanouk the former ruler of 
cambodia and he insists on a role for it china supports the khmer 
rouge 
when he arrived in paris on friday hun sen said there will be 
no comprehensive settlement without the elimination of the khmer 
rouge he said the government in phnom penh cannot sacrifice the 
vital interests of the cambodian people to satisfy other countries 
sihanouk had proposed that a government of the three rebel 
factions and hun sen run the country until general elections he has 
refused any powersharing arrangement between himself and hun sen to 
the exclusion of the others and rejected a french compromise this 
week 
a source in the association of southeast asian nations said the 
six member nations consulted with other delegations friday on the 
outline of a new compromise he would not elaborate but said it 
represented one last goodfaith effort 
the asean members are brunei indonesia malaysia the 
philippines singapore and thailand 
in its first concrete action the conference sent a un 
factfinding mission to cambodia to gather information for the 
dispatch of a force to monitor the vietnamese withdrawal and oversee 
an eventual ceasefire 
hun sens government objects to a role for the united nations as 
long as it continues to recognize sihanouks coalition as the 
cambodian representative 
on wednesday the un mission gave the conference a sixpage 
report recommending selfsufficiency for a monitoring force 
they dont try to give the impression it would be an easy 
operation a western delegate said

namibian guerrilla officials 
were so worried about infiltration by spies that they once detained 
the wife of their leader a newspaper sympathetic to their cause 
reported friday 
the weekly mail a respected antiapartheid newspaper based in 
johannesburg said in a frontpage story that kowambo nujoma wife 
of the guerrilla movements president sam nujoma was detained in 
1986 for an unspecified period on suspicion of being a south african 
spy 
it said she now is free and is believed to have been reconciled 
with her husbands southwest africa peoples organization 
the movement waged a 23year bush war against south african rule 
of namibia before agreeing to a truce as part of the ongoing 
unsponsored transition to independence 
it is expected to win november independence elections but has 
come under mounting criticism for its treatment of dissidents and 
suspected spies during the war 
asked about the weekly mail report guerrilla official nahas 
angula said in windhoek namibia that he could not comment without 
checking with the movements headquarters in luanda angola jesaya 
nyamu a guerrilla spokesman in luanda declined to comment 
angula said he believed mrs nujoma is in luanda 
theoben gurirab the movements foreign affairs secretary 
confirmed at a news conference wednesday that the guerrillas had 
tortured some political prisoners 
he also invited officials of international human rights 
organizations to inspect camps in angola to verify the guerrillas 
claim that all their prisoners have been freed in the past the 
movement refused to allow inspections 
on thursday officials of the un monitoring force in namibia 
said they may inspect the camps 
the weekly mail quoting freed dissidents who have returned to 
namibia said there had been an atmosphere of absurd paranoia and 
spy obsession within the movement 
persistent detailed claims of torture and atrocities made by 
237 former detainees have led even longstanding allies of the 
organization to rebuke swapo and demand a full inquiry into the 
treatment of suspected spies said the newspaper 
the wave of terror it said resulted partly from resentment 
by poorly educated security officials against members of the 
movement who had received university education abroad 
the weekly mail quoted a former detainee as saying mrs nujomas 
sister hilma mushimba had been forced to say during interrogation 
in 1986 that her sister was a south african agent the newspaper 
said mrs nujoma subsequently was detained but it was not known for 
how long 
south african government officials frequently say the newspaper 
is biased in favor of black opposition groups since its founding in 
1985 the newspaper has carried numerous reports from namibia 
critical of south african policies in the territory and conveying 
the positions of the territorys guerrilla movement

many studies predicting manmade global 
warming fail to consider that the earth could heat things up more by 
responding with its own climateshifting effects scientists at a 
ussoviet conference said friday 
until now scientists have predicted global warming would be 
based largely on the rising levels of carbon dioxide and other 
atmospheric gases produced by human activities such as the burning 
of fossil fuels and logging of forests 
many say that such warming left unchecked could drastically 
alter worldwide weather patterns and increase polarice melting 
thereby raising the sea level and flooding coastal regions 
thats bad enough but when natural responses to warming are 
considered the situation looks even grimmer said daniel lashof a 
former environmental protection agency scientist now working for the 
natural resources defense council an environmental group 
all the models are modeling a dead earth lashof said when 
you look at a live earth you get a different answer 
researchers are just starting to study how global warming may 
kill off forests and prompt the release of methane from ocean 
sediments events that in turn could heat up the earth even more 
lashof predicted that these responses and other natural 
feedback could as much as double the amount of global warming 
already forecast by current studies to range from 2 to 10 degrees 
over the next century 
his predictions were supported by others at the conference on 
global warming concluding this weekend at actorfilmmaker robert 
redfords sundance resort in central utah 
studies supporting lashofs conclusions are accumulating on an 
almost daybyday basis said george woodwell director of the 
woods hole research center in massachusetts 
if the biotic effects that appear to be materializing are real 
they have the potential for speeding the process of warming 
appreciably woodwell said 
global warming theories hinge on the greenhouse effect in 
which certain gases in the atmosphere block incoming solar heat from 
escaping back out to space 
those gases such as carbon dioxide and methane have always been 
present and are kept in equilibrium by natural processes the oceans 
absorb carbon dioxide for example as do trees which store carbon 
in trunks branches and roots 
but industrial societies are pumping carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere at muchelevated rates as well as adding new 
greenhouse gases such as chlorofluorocarbons 
research has so far concentrated on measuring and then reducing 
these manmade gases but natural processes that occur as the globe 
heats up are important as well 
an example rising temperatures could destroy entire forests as 
it gets too hot for tree species adapted to the local climate the 
growth rate of trees is very temperaturedependent if they get too 
hot or too cold they dont grow well said daniel botkin a 
biology professor at the university of california at santa barbara 
the scrub brush that follows would not store as much carbon 
botkin said and it would take decades for other more 
heatresistant trees to migrate in from the south he said 
trees may be left behind he said they cant keep up with 
the climate change youd get a pulse of carbon from those forests 
another natural response to global warming could involve methane 
trapped in offshore ocean sediments lashof said if the atmosphere 
warms so will the oceans releasing some of that methane into the 
air 
a global warminginduced shift of forests to the north also could 
heat things up further by decreasing the amount of light reflected 
lashof said trees of the northern boreal forest absorb more heat 
than the snowy tundra 
but that effect could be counteracted elsewhere by greater light 
reflected from the spreading of grassland and desert areas he said 
lashof concedes that other natural processes may slow the rate of 
global warming not increase it 
one recent study suggests for example that warming could 
increase the amount of sunblocking clouds producing a cooling 
effect 
but lashof though conceding his model depends on loose estimates 
for many calculations believes the net effect of the earths 
responses would speed global warming 
woodwell recommended a sharp reduction in the use of fossil fuels 
as the best way to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide stopping the 
destruction of forests and planting new ones also could help he 
said 
lashof said all is not bleak despite the gloomy predictions 
humans are causing global warming but it appears they also can stop 
it if they act in time when you take a look at the problem you 
find there is a lot you can do about it lashof said

security agents rescued a kidnapped israeli gold 
merchant from a well on friday a day and a half after he was seized 
by masked palestinians in the occupied west bank 
shaul mishaniya was found after a huge search by helicopters and 
hundreds of soldiers officials said an arab suspect captured 
thursday led agents of the shin bet secret service to the well in 
the tiny village of abush near tukarem israel tv said three alleged 
kidnappers are in custody 
army officials said the well was about 20 to 23 feet deep but 
that mishaniyas head was above water 
i am healthy thank god and thank you to the israeli army and 
all the soldiers who helped me mishaniya said on israel radio 
mishaniya 47 was the first israeli civilian abducted in the 
20monthold palestinian uprising stirring speculation that leaders 
of the revolt were stepping up the violence in their battle against 
israeli occupation 
israel television said security officials suspected mishaniyas 
kidnapping was part of a hostagebargaining operation 
it said shin bet apprehended one suspect hours after the 
kidnapping and described him as a wanted member of an underground 
palestinian group in abush 
however officials also said they were investigating possible 
criminal motives for the kidnapping 
the motive is not known the investigation is looking into 
whether it is political or criminal or both said col renaan 
gissin deputy military spokesman 
few israelis now venture to the west bank because of the 
uprising mishaniya reportedly there went to collect debts owed him 
by arabs news reports said he argued with an arab merchant before 
he was grabbed wednesday night by masked men carrying knives 
mishaniya said on tv he was inside an arabowned taxi when 
several youths came running one sat next to me on the front seat 
holding a big screwdriver in his hand 
he said the abductors blinfolded him and led him to hills where 
they walked for about three hours the men tried to put me on a 
donkey saying you are an old man its not worth walking but 
i thought they wanted me to fall down and die 
mishaniya said the kidnappers then drove him blindfolded in a car 
and finally put him in the well 
at least 548 palestinians have died in clashes with soldiers or 
israeli civilians during the uprising which began in december 1987 
in lands taken by israel from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle 
wast war fellow arabs killed 97 others as collaborators 
thirtyeight israelis also died in the violence 
in the gaza strip on friday the army demolished three houses and 
partly destroyed a fourth of palestinians accused of killing alleged 
collaborators or playing a role in the uprising the army said 
the army has torn down more than 200 houses in the occupied lands 
during the uprising despite complaints by the united state and 
human rights groups that destroying homes amounts to collective 
punishment 
the jerusalem post quoted army sources as saying a palestinian 
teenager whose body was found tuesday in a west bank refugee camp 
was killed by israeli security forces the night before an army 
spokeswoman could not confirm the report 
also friday the army permanently barred palestinian writer 
mutawakil taha from entering israel an army spokesman said 
taha head of the west bank writers association has been 
repeatedly accused of fostering the uprising

a federal drug agent and his brother pleaded 
innocent to cocaine trafficking charges friday and a us 
magistrate said she would decide monday whether either man should be 
freed on bail 
prosecutor thomas burrows asked us magistrate patti saris to 
hold edward obrien and his brother john without bail 
defense lawyers recommended that edward obrien be released with 
an electronic bracelet that would let authorities check his 
whereabouts and that john obrien be freed on bail 
i do believe there is a serious risk of flight saris said 
but added that she was intrigued by the bracelet idea 
edward obrien who formerly ran the dea office in springfield 
and john obrien were each indicted thursday on five counts of 
cocaine trafficking edward obrien 44 has been placed on 
administrative leave pending the outcome of his case 
obrien a former expert in government sting operations was 
arrested by undercover officers aug 14 at bostons logan 
international airport while allegedly delivering suitcases filled 
with 62 pounds of cocaine 
the 18year dea veteran said in an alleged confession presented 
thursday in court that he was paid to ferry drugs from florida to 
boston 
on friday the defense accused the government of creating the 
case against the obriens 
its the government that decided how much drugs to give him

a military judge sentenced army capt 
pedro fernandez to 300 days in prison for the burning of two young 
dissidents one fatally during an antigovernment protest but 
fernandez will not go to jail 
in handing down the sentence thursday night the judge army gen 
carlos parera said fernandez could show up in court every week for 
one year and sign a control book instead of actually being 
incarcerated 
the procedure called remission of sentence is frequent in 
chilean courts 
the victims lawyers said they will appeal the sentence 
fernandez commanded an army patrol quelling widespread street 
protests against the military government on july 2 1986 when 
rodrigo rojas 18 a chilean photographer living in washington 
dc and carmen gloria quintana a 19yearold university student 
were severely burned 
rojas died four days later ms quintana survived after lengthy 
treatment in chile and in canada 
ms quintana and at least two witnesses charged that soldiers 
doused rojas and her with gasoline and then set them on fire 
fernandez said the two were burned accidentally when a pot of 
gasoline they were carrying ignited he said they intended to set 
street barricades on fire 
parera basically accepted fernandezs account but ruled he was 
negligent in abandoning the two teenagers instead of taking them to 
a hospital 
luis toro and hector salazar the lawyers for the victims said 
fernandez was guilty of the more serious crime of unnecessary 
violence resulting in death and serious injury

prime minister toshiki kaifu chose a woman to 
replace a cabinet minister who resigned friday in the second sex 
scandal of a disastrous year for the governing party 
the appointment of mayumi moriyama 61 as chief cabinet 
secretary was seen as an attempt to limit the damage caused by tokuo 
yamashitas resignation from a government formed just 16 days 
earlier to cleanse the partys scandalridden image 
mrs moriyama is the first woman to be chief cabinet secretary 
and it is the highest government post ever held by a woman in this 
maledominated society she formerly was director of the environment 
agency also a cabinet position 
the chief secretary presides over twiceweekly cabinet meetings 
speaks for the government and coordinates policy discussions among 
ministries 
yamashita 69 stepped down after acknowledging a threeyear 
affair with a bar hostess nearly 45 years his junior 
he became the sixth cabinet member including prime ministers 
noboru takeshita and sousuke uno to resign in less than a year 
because of an influencepeddling scandal publicity over illicit 
sexual liaisons and an election defeat 
a major factor in the election loss last month which cost the 
liberal democrats their majority in parliaments upper house was 
outrage by housewives at a 3 percent sales tax the party forced 
through parliament last fall 
mrs moriyama has experience as a housewife as well as a 
bureaucrat and can see things from a consumers standpoint kaifu 
said in announcing the appointment she will be able to include 
the peoples perspective in policy discussions 
takako doi the popular woman leader of the newly vigorous 
socialist party has been the main beneficiary of the public 
discontent with the governing party the selection of mrs moriyama 
was seen as a way to counter ms dois impact 
i am completely speechless ms doi said of mrs moriyamas 
appointment i wonder what he thinks women are it is a reflection 
of a lack of responsibility of the ldp 
ms dois party was the big winner in the upper house against the 
conservative liberal democrats who have governed japan since the 
party was formed in 1955 
kaifu became prime minister aug 9 when uno resigned after 69 
days in office to take responsibility for the election defeat uno 
also was pursued by allegations that he kept paid mistresses 
yamashita told a news conference friday the kaifu 
administration had placed cleaning up politics at the head of its 
agenda and had been entrusted with the hopes of the people in the 
end i have decided that i must resign 
he said he had apologized to his wife kyoko and she had 
forgiven him 
mrs moriyama a former bureaucrat in the labor ministry was 
elected to the upper house in 1980 kaifu chose her for the 
environment agency her first cabinet post when he formed his 
government 
asked whether she expected problems she told reporters i was 
just appointed and i cant really tell what it is going to be like 
but as far as my near 40year professional experience is concerned 
i never felt any handicaps from being a woman 
setsu shiga former deputy to the chief cabinet secretary was 
named to replace her in the environment post 
on friday he acknowledged receiving 21100 in political 
donations from recruit co the publishing conglomerate at the 
center of the influencebuying scandal that caused takeshita to 
resign june 2 
i have many financially sound companies who support me shiga 
said recruit back then was regarded as a very financially healthy 
and growing company ive done nothing wrong 
analysts said yamashitas resignation would undermine kaifus 
leadership as he tries to rescue the reputations of the government 
and party 
the sex scandal will be particularly damaging said 
political analyst masaya ito the clean and progressive image was 
said to be the only strength for the kaifu administration which 
lacks a strong power base within the party 
commentator soichiro tawara said of mrs moriyama the 
appointment is apparently aimed at bettering the image of the 
government she may be helpful in some ways but i am not 
confident that a politician with such limited experience can handle 
perhaps the most demanding position in the cabinet

fasting in front of the us embassy to protest being denied visas 
to go to the united states 
the us government used to accept almost all soviet jews who 
applied for immigration but changed its policy in october because 
of the large number now permitted to leave the soviet union 
we have just been drinking water since monday said edward 
leitman who has lived for seven months with his wife and daughter 
in ladispoli north of rome this may possibly make them change 
their minds 
us embassy spokesman michael hahn declined comment on the 
protest friday he said recently that soviet jews now must 
demonstrate they were persecuted for political or religious reasons 
to enter the united states as refugees 
since october about 4000 applicants at the embassy in italy 
have been denied visas he said 
the fast is the latest protest by soviet jews in front of the 
embassy 
italy is a transit point for soviets trying to immigrate to other 
western countries all of the jews could immigrate to israel but 
most are trying to get to the united states or canada

baiecomeau canada ap thirteen people including the captain 
of a soviet freighter were charged with contempt of court friday 
for the dumping of 15 containers of toxic waste barred by a court 
injunction 
the cargo remained on the government wharf of this st lawrence 
seaport friday blocking shipments and an adjacent ferry it was 
unloaded there before dawn thursday by the soviet freighter nadezhda 
obukhova which then steamed out of the harbor 
judge paul corriveau of quebec superior court charged four 
officials from dynamis envirotech the montreal company hired to 
dispose of the waste a vicepresident of the public utility 
hydroquebec which was to store the waste six truck drivers hired 
to move it to a storage depot a man apparently canadian 
identified only as gaeten halle and the freighter captain who was 
not identified by name 
they must appear before corriveau on sept 28 offenders can be 
fined up to 5000 and a year in jail 
the cargo of polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs was shipped from 
montreal to liverpool in britain where it was turned away by dock 
owners and workers after protests from environmentalists 
the soviet freighter then returned to canada with the cargo 
which was to be stored temporarily at a facility near baiecomeau 
while authorities considered other ways to get rid of the poisonous 
chemical which usually is incinerated at very high heat 
baiecomeau community groups won a court injunction early 
thursday forbidding the unloading of the cargo 
court documents say the captain was served with the injunction 
but the ship slipped its moorings and set sail without the 
containers 
the cargo is part of 1500 tons of noxious waste that the quebec 
government contracted dynamis envirotech to dispose of for 79 
million 
polychlorinated biphenyls were used primarily as a coolant in 
electrical transformers but have been banned in north america 
because of links to cancer they cause skin diseases and are toxic 
to a variety of animals especially fish and may affect animal 
reproduction

a convicted rapist freed on bail while 
awaiting trial in another rape case has been charged with murdering 
a bank executive who apparently was kidnapped on her lunch hour and 
shot in a city park 
daniel j webb 27 was ordered held on 16 million bond friday 
in the death of diane gellenbeck 37 of newington a vice president 
at connecticut national bank 
ms gellenbeck was last seen alive when she left for her lunch 
break thursday at about 1 pm police checking reports of gunshots 
found her bulletriddled body fully clothed except for shoes near 
the golf course in keney park police were awaiting test results to 
see if she had been raped 
a spokesman for the bank said ms gellenbeck was single and had 
worked for the bank for 16 years 
webb turned himself in at hartford police headquarters about four 
hours later after police surrounded his bloomfield home 
the attack in the park was similar to the 1984 kidnap and rape 
that landed webb in prison he was convicted of abducting a woman 
from the hartford civic center parking garage taking her to keney 
park and raping her 
police have not confirmed that ms gellenbeck was kidnapped 
thursday but two legal sources said she was kidnapped at the civic 
center garage before she was taken to the park 
based on her appointments calendar there was no reason for 
her to be in the park at that time said hartford police lt 
frederick lewis the large public park is about two miles from 
gellenbecks downtown office 
asked if webb was known to hartford police lewis sighed and 
said notoriously 
hartford states attorney john bailey said webb has been arrested 
several times since his release from prison believed to be in 1986 
each time on charges of sexual assault or robbery but prosecutors 
have been unable to keep him behind bars as he awaits trial 
after being freed from prison and put on probation for his 1984 
conviction webb was arrested and jailed again in june 1988 on 
charges he forced a womans car off of a highway in new britain 
then kidnapped her and raped her but in june of this year webb 
still awaiting trial was released when he put up his fathers 
storefront church as a 200000 property bond 
webb was arrested again july 29 on charges of robbery and larceny 
in east hartford but again he made bond prosecutors went to court 
as recently as monday seeking to have the bond increased but a 
judge put off a ruling because webbs lawyer was out of town 
this has been a very frustrating case for the state bailey 
said we have done everything we could under the current law to 
keep him incarcerated 
bailey complained that state laws prevent pretrial detention for 
suspects believed to be dangerous and prevent judges from 
considering how dangerous an accused criminal is when they set bond 
bond is set based on whether a judge believes the accused will 
show up for trial and no one is held without bond bailey said 
weve been arguing for five years for preventive detention no 
bail if the guy is dangerous bailey said 
superior court judge andre kocay set webbs current bond so high 
bailey said because the number of charges against him increased the 
likelihood that he would not show up for trial

former premier andreas papandreou on friday 
refused to testify before a parliamentary committee looking into his 
alleged involvement in a major financial scandal that led to his 
fall from power 
instead papandreou sent a note questioning the committees 
legality 
parliament voted in july to authorize investigation of 
panpandreou and four of his former ministers in the 210 million 
bank of crete embezzlement scandal 
papandreous panhellenic socialist movement lost national 
elections in june amid allegations that he and former ministers 
authorized the activities of the banks owner and chairman george 
koskotas or took bribes from him 
a government formed by the conservative new democracy party and 
the communistled coalition of the left and progress vowed a cleanup 
koskotas fled to the united states in november but a boston 
magistrate ruled this week he should be extradited to greece 
the banker has claimed in interviews that papandreou blackmailed 
him into embezzling for the benefit of his party papandreou denies 
it 
in his message to the committee on friday papandreou wrote i 
will not go into the legality of the proposal for an investigation 
and the procedures of the committee nor into the interests which 
they undoubtedly serve 
he referred members to a memorandum he submitted last february to 
an earlier commission of inquiry formed when he was premier that 
committee was disbanded prior to the elections before submitting a 
report 
papandreou said then that he met three times with koskotas at 
koskotas request but that he moved swiftly to order an 
investigation into the bankers illegal activities when informed of 
them 
papandreou and his party say the scandal has been exploited by 
their political enemies 
the committee must submit its report to parliament by sept 9 
deputies will then vote on whether papandreou and his former 
ministers will stand trial before a special court 
meanwhile another parliamentary committee investigating 
widespread wiretaps allegedly carried out during papandreous eight 
years in power asked papandreou on friday to testify or submit a 
memorandum before the month ends 
papandreou is also being investigated in connection with his 
governments purchase of 80 us and french jet fighters that the 
present government claims were overpriced

district attorneys office agreed to reduce the charge 
an autopsy found 2weekold david died oct 22 1988 from a

mixing the formula and feeding the infant earlier that evening 
the infant was killed as a result of substance abuse hodges 
ruled 
david was born with cocaine in his system the division of family 
and youth services would not release the baby to grubbs until the 
drug left his system and grubbs agreed to have him tested for the 
drug twice a week 
trooper investigator steve foster said grubbs brought david in 
twice for the test which he passed but she missed the third 
session 
grubbs 18monthold son jeffrey was also tested after his 
brothers death and cocaine was found in his system 
goldman told hodges that urinalysis tests for cocaine given to 
grubbs from january through june 12 found traces of cocaine residue

she must report to jail dec 1 she is due to deliver her next 
child oct 1 
grubbs also was ordered to complete a six to 18month drug 
treatment program after her jail term

send a message to the public that this kind of conduct will not be 
tolerated 
grubbs attorney paul canarsky of the public defenders office 
said grubbs was herself a victim a passive recipient of drugs 
from her former boyfriend 
he said the man beat grubbs forced her to work as a topless 
dancer and supplied her with cocaine canarsksy said since grubbs 
left the man she has been drug free and her urinalysis tests have 
come back clean grubbs has been free on her own recognizance since 
her arrest

program instead of jail he said friday that grubbs has not decided 
whether to appeal

cocaineaddicted mother convicted of delivering drugs to two of her

the top charge assault carries a maximum penalty of five to 15 
years 
the slaying drew appeals from throughout the city for renewed 
efforts to repair race relations memorial and protest marches were 
organized for the weekend

strifefilled mood following the howard beach racial attack of 
december 1986 when michael griffith a black was hit by a car 
while fleeing a gang of white teenagers incensed at blacks entering 
their queens neighborhood 
some figures who had roles in the howard beach drama entered the

major howard beach defendants and c vernon mason who as attorney 
for one of the black survivors forced appointment of a special

investigated the 1982 slaying of willie turks a black transit 
worker beaten to death by a crowd of whites outside a brooklyn bagel 
shop four suspects were convicted of manslaughter or assault 
murphy told reporters that mondello was not the boyfriend jilted 
by gina feliciano he said mondello conceded being at the scene and 
having a bat but maintained that mondello was armed to protect 
himself against the girls threat that her black and hispanic 
friends would beat him up 
police said miss feliciano was cooperating with the investigation 
commissioner benjamin ward said the gang of 10 to 30 whites were 
looking for blacks and hispanics they believed were coming to the 
neighborhood to attend miss felicianos 18th birthday party 
they did not know that miss feliciano fearing trouble had 
called off the party ward said the white youths mistakenly went 
after hawkins and his friends stanford 18 troy banner 18 and 
luther sylvester 17 sylvester is a cousin of griffith the howard 
beach victim 
david dinkins the only black candidate in the september mayoral 
primary said it wasnt mistaken identity it was a case of any

a judge found a drifter guilty of 
firstdegree murder friday in the beating death of a 24yearold 
woman who had just started working as an intern reporter at the 
local newspaper 
rodney woidtke 28 was convicted of killing audrey cardenas a 
recent graduate of texas aampm university who had been in town only 11 
days when she disappeared june 19 1988 
her nude body was found in a dry creek bed a week later by a 
custodian at belleville township high school east ms cardenas 
formerly of bakersfield calif had come to illinois to work for 
the belleville newsdemocrat 
judge richard a aguirre who presided over the fiveday bench 
trial set sentencing for sept 28 woidtke could face a 20 to 
60year sentence 
in closing arguments earlier friday defense attorney brian k 
trentmann said police made woidtke a scapegoat in the slaying and 
failed to fully examine the possibility of other suspects 
they picked up this poor transient who clearly has a mental 
problem and threw him in the slammer trentmann said 
scott mansfield assistant st clair county states attorney 
said woidtke knew too much about the crime scene to be innocent 
including the position of the pipe used in the murder 
i think the evidence shows clearly that the defendant is a 
troubled person full of sexual delusions feelings of sexual 
inadequacies with a burning desire to find a woman and have a 
relationship mansfield said 
he decided to take that action and got himself a woman we 
dont know how but he got audrey cardenas 
at a pretrial hearing last week police sgt mark heffernan said 
that when he interviewed woidtke on june 27 1988 the day he was 
arrested for crossing police lines near the site where the body was 
discovered a day earlier the first question he asked was whether 
the suspect had killed and sexually assaulted ms cardenas 
he answered yes and no he answered that he had killed her but 
that he did not rape her heffernan said 
it could not be determined whether ms cardenas had been raped 
because of the decomposition of her body authorities said 
courtappointed psychologist dr daniel cuneo testified friday 
that when he first examined woidtke last summer he concluded the 
defendant was a paranoid schizophrenic 
woidtke initially was ruled unfit to stand trial in ms cardenas 
death 
in june based on a report by a psychiatrist at the chester 
mental health center that he had made substantial improvement a 
judge declared woidtke fit for trial

a guardian angel whose shooting death 
last weekend led to protests and accusations from the crimefighting 
group had killed himself playing russian roulette with two members 
one of them 14 authorities in this district of columbia suburb said 
friday 
i should have used more caution before criticizing police and 
publicly naming two people as the suspected killers said guardian 
angels founder curtis sliwa after learning of the results of the 
police investigation 
sliwa also said he would meet with members of the civilian group 
to emphasize its policy against weapons 
prince georges county police lt col robert phillips said 
dorian brown 19 had apparently initiated the game and was the 
first one to pull the trigger on the 357caliber magnum when he was 
killed late saturday night 
one of the other two was 14 years old and the other was 22 
phillips said refusing to name them he also said brown had been 
drinking and with a blood alcohol level of 007 percent was close to 
the 008 percent concentration that maryland uses to define as 
under the influence of alcohol the state defines 
intoxicated as 010 percent 
its just a terrible tragedy for the group for dorian and the 
community at large sliwa said 
russian roulette is played by loading only one round into a 
revolver and spinning the cylinder the player then points the gun 
at his own head and pulls the trigger hoping the hammer strikes an 
empty chamber 
the shooting happened in the organizations office in a 
drugridden apartment complex where the group has patrolled since 
april the group immediately claimed the recruit was killed by drug 
dealers and organized several demonstrations this week to protest 
browns death 
phillips said the tragedy began when brown found the door to the 
office ajar 
sliwa said brown called in two recruits that he knew 
personally 
because one of them assumed there was a breakin one took his 
fathers revolver sliwa said they went to the headquarters and 
were sitting around apparently dorian had booze and he and one 
other recruit were drinking and the other one took the weapon 
out 
sliwa said he would reinforce the antiweapons policy in the 
face of this prevailing notion that you solve problems with a gun 
earlier in the day bounty hunters captured a member of the 
guardian angels unit michael marshall 19 who they said had failed 
to appear in baltimore county circuit court on a robbery charge

a former federal drug agent charged with cocaine 
trafficking allegedly confessed to the crime the night he was 
arrested according to testimony thursday in federal court 
but edward obriens defense attorneys portrayed him as a man 
known by government investigators to be in deep financial and 
emotional trouble months before they set him up and arrested him in 
an undercover sting 
obrien signed a statement aug 15 saying that on two occasions 
he was paid a total of 39000 to ferry drugs with another man from 
florida to boston for a man who identified himself as a cocaine 
dealer according to a copy of the document presented at the hearing 
before us magistrate patti saris 
arthur carter jr a senior inspector with the deas office of 
professional responsibility also testified that obrien admitted 
under questioning that he had used a total of 147000 in dea money 
for personal business but later replaced the money 
obrien who formerly ran the dea office in springfield and his 
brother john obrien were each indicted thursday on five counts of 
cocaine trafficking 
the two were being held without bail pending the outcome of the 
detention hearing which was expected to resume friday 
charges against a third brother paul obrien were dismissed 
thursday but prosecutor thomas n burrows refused to explain why 
attorneys for edward obrien argued that the pretrial publicity 
had already made it impossible for the brothers to get a fair trial 
they asked the judge to close the bail hearing to the public 
saris refused saying the most damaging information has probably 
already been disclosed that decision cleared the way for obriens 
alleged confession to be read allowed in court 
in the fivepage statement obrien wrote in longhand that he 
brought drugs to boston twice once by car for 25000 and again by 
airplane for 14000 he was arrested after the second trip 
obrien said he gave 8000 from the first advance to his brother 
john to repay a loan to johns girlfriend 
in addition obrien wrote during the last 2 years i 
utilized some of the seized funds which were later replaced the 
total used but not in one lump sum was approximately 147000 
obrien allegedly used the money to help bail out the familys 
floundering company cape cod ice carter testified that edward 
obrien told him that john obrien had allegedly skimmed some 
230000 from the business 
under cross examination by defense attorneys carter acknowledged 
that he had information from three informants and a springfield 
police lieutenant as early as february or march indicating that 
edward obrien was emotionally unstable and possibly suicidal 
the defense attempted to show that the dea never approached 
obrien about the missing money or requested a psychological 
evaluation or offered him any kind of help instead the dea set up 
a sting 
you just wait for them to fall concluded john obriens 
defense attorney richard cohen 
im not a psychiatrist carter replied my job is to put 
people in jail

broadcast engineers camera workers and 
newswriters have accepted a fouryear contract with capital 
citiesabc inc 
the contract goes into effect saturday for all 2500 members of 
the national association of broadcast employees and technicians 
except two people who make up a newswriters unit in chicago union 
officials said something would be worked out soon with the two 
holdouts 
the contract which replaces one that expired march 31 provides 
a firstyear ratification bonus ranging from 61 percent to 7 
percent there are 3 percent raises in each of the second and third 
years and a 4 percent increase in the fourth year 
the contract although lacking in many areas is considered by 
the union as the best it could obtain under the present 
circumstances facing nabet and others in the broadcast industry 
said john krieger a union spokesman 
it was best to reach a settlement through considerable 
compromise rather than through any confrontation as we did with nbc 
in the 17week strike in 1987 krieger said 
nabet represents engineers camera workers video tape editors 
newswriters makeup people publicists couriers and traffic and 
communication coordinators 
the contract covers units at cap citiesabc radio and television 
network operations and radio and television stations in new york 
los angeles washington san francisco chicago and various news 
bureaus 
the pressing issue was job security for radio engineers in an era 
when broadcast companies are needing their specialized restricted 
services less and less 
krieger said the company promised to move the endangered radio 
engineers into television if necessary 
the company said it got increased flexibility to overcome a 
number of restrictive work rules including rules that restricted 
certain jobs such as turning microphones off and on to engineers 
the company said the contract also gives it an enhanced ability 
to acquire and originate live and taped sports news and 
entertainment programing and broader and more flexible daily 
employment rights 
the new contract grants the company the relief we sought since 
the negotiations began six months ago while providing the union 
with certain securities it sought jeffrey ruthizer the cap 
citiesabc chief negotiator said in a statement friday

new evidence has prompted 
prosecutors to investigate whether nazis killed retarded children 
during world war ii a newspaper said friday 
according to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper historian karl 
teppe has found evidence that 3000 mentally retarded children were 
killed in dortmund area hospitals after undergoing nazi experiments 
between 1939 and 1945 
dortmund chief prosecutor klaus schacht was not in his office 
friday and could not be reached for comment on the report 
the nazis fatal experiments on people are part of the historical 
record but the newspaper said the killings uncovered by teppe were 
not previously known 
teppe of muenster uncovered the evidence while looking into the 
wartime operations of seven hospitals according to the newspaper 
one of the institutions was the dortmundaplerbeck hospital 
which now is the westphalia clinic for psychiatry 
officials there were shocked by teppes conclusions and have 
started their own investigation the newspaper said 
it quoted clinic official annette jedwabski as saying the 
doctors and nurses who work in the clinic today are all with 
certainty free from blame 
but she added we cannot just let this drop especially since 
there are many patients here who themselves certainly would have 
become nazi victims 
schacht is worried the investigation could be hindered by the 
length of time that has passed since the end of the nazi era the 
newspaper said 
it is suspected that many documents have disappeared since 
1945 and it is still unclear who among the responsible doctors and 
nurses is still alive according to the newspaper 
an estimated 6 million people were murdered in the nazi holocaust

15yearold died while being questioned and an israeli gold dealer 
was kidnapped on a nighttime business trip to the west bank 
according to army and arab reports thursday 
israels supreme court rejected appeals by four palestinians of 
army orders to deport them as leaders of the 20monthold uprising 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
shaul mishaniya 47 was the first israeli abducted since the 
uprising began dec 8 1987 and officials said the motive might be 
criminal hundreds of soldiers and police were searching for him 
the 15yearold palestinian died mysteriously wednesday while 
being questioned by soldiers near jerusalem 
arab reporters in the gaza strip said a 19yearold was shot down 
wednesday night by soldiers in civilian dress driving cars with gaza 
license plates his death was the ninth reported this week in gaza 
at least 547 palestinians have been killed by israeli troops or 
civilians in the uprising and 97 have been slain by fellow arabs as 
alleged collaborators thirtyeight israelis have died 
the army said it detained about 120 palestinians suspected of 
security offenses over the last days officials said the west bank 
arrests are likely to continue 
in the mixed arabjewish tel aviv suburb of jaffa police 
detained seven arabs suspected of passing weapons to palestinian 
guerrillas in gaza the national news agency itim said 
in the west bank the army imposed curfews on tulkarem and 
surrounding villages while helicopters crisscrossed the area and 
security forces conducted a housetohouse search for mishaniya 
an israeli colonel not identified said on army radio we go 
from one house to another door to door to the roofs basements 
as far as the imagination can go 
arabs said mishaniya was seized after hundreds of masked youths 
surrounded an arabdriven taxi he took to tulkaren on wednesday 
night 
israeli radio quoted his family as saying mishaniya was having 
financial troubles and went to tulkarem to collect debts from arab 
gold dealers but arab sources said he often went to the west bank

on israel radio all residents of the palestinian refugee camp at 
tulkarem should be deported in retaliation for the kidnapping that 
would be nearly 10000 people

slain in his beverly hills mansion believes mobsters had him 
executed because he refused to do business with them his sister 
said friday 
we think he made the mistake of buying a business that had been 
used before by the mafia and we think he was trying to run it

improving the companys performance 
two of the three companies operated by live entertainment had 
been linked to organized crime before live entertainment bought 
them although live entertainment acting president roger r smith 
has vehemently rejected suggestions that the deaths may have a mob 
link 
ms menendezcano the dead mans sister and former california 
lt gov mike curb a friend for nearly a decade described menendez 
as absolutely honest although an extremely aggressive businessman 
he was very direct although he had a great sense of humor 
said curb the owner of a small record label who met menendez when 
curb was negotiating with rca to distribute a record by the country 
act the judds 
sometimes he had to tell people things they didnt want to 
hear curb said but he was a wonderful guy an absolutely 
outstanding person i just cant believe something like this could 
happen

directors guild of america in hollywood where 400 people listened 
to the menendezs sons eric 18 and lyle 22 eulogize their 
parents 
ms menendezcano said she had been unaware that two of her 
brothers companies had once been linked to organized crime until 
she read newspaper stories on the killings she said her brother had 
always tried to keep the video business clean 
the first thing he did was to get rid of the porno business 
she said because of his success he probably was stepping on many 
shoes which some people didnt like

chain in the northeast live entertainment completed its acquisition 
of beckzack this june 
beckzacks principal shareholder morris levy was convicted in 
may 1988 of conspiring to extort payments from a record wholesaler

a second rebel group in ethiopia has approved 
former president jimmy carter as an observer for peace talks but a 
carter center official said friday the group would not be included 
in the discussions here 
representatives of ethiopia and another rebel group the eritrean 
peoples liberation front plan to meet at the carter center in 
atlanta beginning sept 7 with carter acting as an observer 
earlier this week the tigre peoples liberation front announced 
in a clandestine radio broadcast that it was accepting carter 
calling on the ethiopian government to respond quickly to the 
proposal 
dayle e powell a carter center fellow who heads the 
presidential librarys conflict resolution programs said the 
tigrean announcement was welcome news but that their conflict with 
the ethiopian government is unrelated to that of the eritreans 
as a result ms powell said talks between the ethiopian 
government and the tigreans could not be included in the september 
meeting she added that carter would get involved in the tigrean 
issue only if ethiopia also agreed 
the tigrean rebels based in tigray province took up arms 14 
years ago to press for increased autonomy for their region 
early this year they scored several major victories and forced 
troops out of five towns including the provincial capital of 
mekele 470 miles northwest of addis ababa 
the eritreans in ethiopias northernmost eritrea province have 
been fighting for independence since 1961 
both rebel groups agreed to peace talks after president mengistu 
haile mariams announcement in june that the government had no

the former clerk of cook county circuit court the 
nations largest court system was sentenced friday to 10 years in 
prison for corruption uncovered during the federal operation 
incubator probe 
morgan finley 63 stood silently with his arms folded across his 
chest as us district judge ilana rovner sentenced him for taking 
bribes threatening a witness and attempted extortion 
finley pleaded for leniency before the sentencing i am sorry 
that i involved myself in this mess not only for myself but mostly 
for my wife and family he said 
ms rovner ordered him to turn himself in to authorities on oct 
23 pay 50000 in fines and 25000 in restitution for bribes he 
took 
you and you alone took yourself from the pinnacle of power 
to stand here in a place you should only have visited in your 
official capacity she said 
it is obvious that your representation of all that occurred can 
only be characterized at best as skewed and at worst as lies 
the judge also said evidence that finley had threatened an fbi 
agent twice during the trial weighed heavily in the sentencing 
decision 
ms rovner and assistant us attorney ira raphaelson said 
videotapes showing finley taking 7500 in cash were the most 
convincing evidence of his guilt 
morgan finley sold the office of the clerk of the circuit court 
of cook county in no uncertain terms raphaelson said those 
tapes show what morgan finley is about 
finleys attorney louis garippo maintained his client was 
enticed into taking the bribe the money was there it was shoved 
at him and he took the money garippo said he is a good man who 
was drawn into something 
the videotape viewed during the trial showed fbi mole michael 
raymond and former court investigator michael lambesis in raymonds 
apartment having lunch with finley on dec 4 1985 
raymond reaches beneath a kitchen apron to pull out a wad of 
money and a hand identified as finleys extends into the frame of

a state appeals court friday overturned 
the firstdegree assault conviction of an aidsinfected inmate who 
bit a prison guard but said there was enough evidence to support a 
lesser assault charge 
in a 41 ruling the alabama court of criminal appeals said there 
was insufficient evidence to uphold adam brocks conviction for 
firstdegree assault and his 15year sentence 
but the judges said the facts supported a conviction on a 
lesser charge of thirddegree assault the appeals court sent the 
case back to limestone county circuit court for brock to be 
sentenced for thirddegree assault a misdemeanor punishable by a 
maximum one year in jail 
firstdegree assault is a felony involving the use of a deadly 
weapon or a dangerous instrument to cause serious physical injury 
brock 31 is confined in a special unit at the limestone 
correctional facility in capshaw for inmates infected with the 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus 
in january 1988 brock scuffled with officer jim gates when gates 
tried to remove prohibited ink pens from brocks cell gates was 
bitten on the arm but three subsequent tests showed no traces of 
the aids virus 
brock was charged with attempted murder in the first criminal 
case ever brought in alabama involving a bite by a person infected 
with the aids virus but a jury convicted him of a reduced charge of 
firstdegree assault 
the appeals court in a ruling written by judge william bowen 
said the state failed to prove that brock used his mouth and teeth 
under circumstances highly capable of causing death or serious 
physical injury 
this court can not take judicial notice that biting is a means 
capable of spreading aids while aids may very well be transmitted 
through a human bite there was no evidence to that effect at trial 
and we do not believe that is established scientific fact the 
court ruled 
the court said however that the state did prove elements of 
assault in the third degree 
under alabama law a person can be convicted of thirddegree 
assault if while trying to prevent a peace officer from performing 
his duty the person causes physical injury to anyone 
brock originally was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1977 for 
robbery and buying and receiving stolen property in jefferson 
county hale said

ive been writing songs since i was this high freelove said 
i used to have to vacuum and clean the house and i used to make up 
songs i have tapes of almost everything ive done ive got gobs of 
tapes of when i was a little guy i was a much better songwriter 
when i was 13 
korniloff the daughter of violinists lived in the netherlands 
and scarsdale ny 
my first song was a very very sad love song about a boy who 
was supposed to my boyfriend who i caught with another girl i was 
so devastated i went upstairs to the attic of my house with my 
little guitar and played my heart out 
their debut album 2 nice girls features original songs from 
all three and a unique overlapping of lou reeds sweet jane and 
joan armatradings love and affection the version on 2 nice 
girls was a live performance on an austin public radio station 
we went on for an hourlong program called live set 
korniloff said our friends were all invited to be in the studio 
and lend that live clapping air to the show 
we tried a couple of times to record the song in the studio 
but we could never recapture vocally what we did that one time as 
it turned out the station still had the master copy on twotrack 
which they let us use they said its your performance we only 
have the tape 
the melodies and sweet harmonies make two nice girls easy to 
listen to but my heart crawls off written by phillips and sara 
hickman is a bitter song about jealousy 
thats the power of being a songwriter phillips said i 
just wrote this horrible song about president bush thats got a 
really lovely melody if i just made another punk anthem called i 
hate you it wouldnt be really effective 
freelove wrote money a long way from the motown hit of the 
same title that proclaimed the best things in life are free but 
you can keep it for the bird and bees instead freelove warns 
against being a slave to money 
its about money and obsession and the ways it numbs you out 
freelove said money keeps many of us protected from distressing 
things disturbing things people who have money can shield 
themselves from observing the homeless 
their sound recalls the roches and indigo girls but what could 
have influenced phillips i spent my last ten dollars on birth 
control and beer or the holland song in which korniloff 
sings the dutch are too much 
i dont really think of these songs as song of experience but 
songs of perspective she said i think that the content of the 
songs are much more about how life ought to be what wed like for 
it to be like 
we consciously try to create a sense of community its more 
likely to save us from horribly depressing lives you have some sort 
of good feelings bands are at an advantage theyre capable of 
doing that

andy griffith is a man who likes to bring his 
work home but this is the first chance hes had to do that in more 
than 40 years 
this historic village on the north carolina coast where 
griffiths acting career began is the backdrop for the season opener 
for his television series matlock 
i always wanted to bring a show here griffith said recently 
in a break from filming i thought it would be good for the town 
and good for the company 
a native of mount airy and graduate of the university of north 
carolina at chapel hill griffith put fictional mayberry nc on 
the map 
that was in his popular tv series the andy griffith show and 
yet he said the producers of that show saw no point in taping in 
the state because people already believed it was done here 
when griffith suggested filming an episode of matlock in 
north carolina he had no trouble persuading the producers 
we took a flight down here and fell in love said supervising 
producer jeff peters he loved the show so much he brought it 
home andy puts himself totally into this especially in this 
episode these are his people and his friends 
the twohour show which will air on nbc on sept 19 was filmed 
entirely on and around roanoke island where the first english 
colonists landed and where griffith has had a home for more than 30 
years 
the episode the hunting party has ben matlock called to 
defend a man accused of killing a member of his brothers hunting 
group matlock discovers a hostile environment that may hinder a 
fair trial 
about 20 local residents were hired for the crew and dozens as 
extras in the cast 
this is a valentine from andy for the whole community said 
della basnight whose family has been friends with griffith since he 
played sir walter raleigh for five summers in the outdoor musical 
drama the lost colony 
during the matlock taping art sometimes imitated life in 
the closing scene the crowd cheered as matlock a big city lawyer 
from atlanta emerged victorious from the courthouse 
ms basnight and a handful of her relatives who play themselves 
descend on matlock for photos as part of the scene 
smile said ms basnights 79yearold mother cora mae 
basnight as she is pushed next to matlock for a pose to complete 
the scene 
andy came up to the house and asked me did i like to play in 
it and i said yes explained mrs basnight whose late husband 
saint clair basnight sr and griffith were good friends 
daddy also went barefoot around town and so did andy 
recalled saint clair basnight jr who has a few speaking lines in 
the show two or three times a year you see him griffith in 
town in the hardware store to him i think this is home hes 
never lost touch 
griffith made sure a lot of the local flavor shows through in the 
episode beach scenes were shot in nags head while other segments 
were shot at the lost colony theater and along the roanoke sound 
waterfront 
griffith said playing ben matlock has been the highlight of his 
career which has included characters ranging from the bumbling will 
stockwell in the comedy film no time for sergeants to sheriff 
andy taylor in the andy griffith show 
its the best role i ever played griffith said andy 
taylor was a wonderful character and it was the best experience of 
my professional life 
griffith who has added former costar don knotts to the 
matlock cast said the andy griffith show provided him eight 
years of fine creative experience 
but he said ben matlock and andy taylor dont have that much in 
common except that both come out of my innards 
andy taylor was a very very good man he said matlock is 
a good man but he wants to win hes very shrewd 
griffith who expects matlock to end after its fifth season 
plans to make manteo his permanent home and use it as a work base 
andy america loves him peters said hes got this 
tremendous following hes one of those stars who have endured and 
endeared

hoosiers trying to join a nationwide movement 
to turn railroad corridors into long narrow parks for hiking and 
biking are being blocked just like a busy street by a slowmoving 
freight train 
indiana is surrounded by states that are really taking a lead 
on these railstotrails programs said peter harnik of the 
washingtonbased railstotrails conservancy id say hoosiers are 
missing a great opportunity 
at least seven indiana cities hammond highland hobart 
chesterton carmel laporte and portage are trying to create 
linear parks from unused railroad rightsofway the hoosier 
railstotrails council is lobbying indianapolis officials to turn 
one into a trail through the city 
most cities are short on the money to develop trails in others 
residents express concern about the effects of a surge in 
recreational visitors however advocates say crime goes down and 
the local economy improves when tourists flock to wellkept rail 
trails 
were missing the boat financially said ed paynter 
treasurer of the indianapolis group were missing the boat 
recreationally 
in 1916 the united states had the largest railroad system in the 
world with more than 250000 miles of track as trucks planes 
buses and cars began to take over railroads merged consolidated 
their routes and shut down 
nationwide railroads each year abandon more than 3000 miles of 
track the presidents commission on americans outdoors recommended 
turning the corridors into paths for hiking biking and horseback 
riding congress last year passed the national trails system 
improvement act requiring the interstate commerce commission and 
national park service to encourage such conversion 
as of january 32 states had created 2700 miles of rail trails 
with an average length of 133 miles according to the 
railstotrails conservancy the leaders include wisconsin with 18 
trails totaling 443 miles illinois with 20 measuring 203 miles 
and ohio with 11 totaling 142 miles 
in indiana more than 2400 miles of tracks lie unused 
highland leaders envision a 2mile trail cutting diagonally 
across the northwestern indiana city which has gained use of two 
abandoned rightsofway the 200footwide corridor is being 
developed piecemeal during a search for contractors willing to level 
it in exchange for the materials there 
there is a market for that if you are willing to not do it all 
at once to date it hasnt cost us anything but all we have to show 
for it is a halfmile section said parks and recreation 
superintendent frank n deatley 
in portage planners wanting to use two abandoned railways the 
elgin joliet and eastern and the norfolk southern to link four 
parks are stalled in negotiations over price the fivemile trails 
would intersect in an x and allow residents to ride to all four 
corners of the northwestern city 
carmel mayor dorothy hancock wants to create a fivemile trail 
along a monon corridor that goes south into indianapolisthe 
railroad wants 965000 but hancock said thats not anything we 
would pay or think about paying 
the city hopes to start next summer by opening a onemile path 
meanwhile attorneys are researching the railroads title to the 
rest of the corridor 
hammond mayor thomas mcdermott wants to develop 4 miles of the 
erie lackawanna into an urban trail that might eventually link the 
northwestern city to nearby griffith and chesterton 
were encountering some heavy opposition by the common council 
because theyre not willing to put up any money to develop it 
said planner valerie dehner they dont see it as an amenity or an 
economic tool which it definitely can be 
in indianapolis a coalition of 600 businesses and other 
supporters have tried to persuade officials to create a trail in the 
monon corridor that once carried people to chicago the city bought 
it from csx transportation with an 800000 loan from the urban mass 
transportation administration if it is used for mass transit within 
10 years the city does not have to repay the money 
a trail would not meet that provision other options include a 
highspeed bus line a monorail or an elevated train a series of 
public hearings will be held to determine the best use said dave 
arland a spokesman for mayor william hudnut we want that 
corridor to be used for whatever the majority of people want it to 
be used for 
that process can take years and trail advocates are becoming 
impatient 
it can be done they all forget the process needs to be 
continuously reactivated in their minds said allen kress a 
planner with the northwest indiana regional planning commission 
trails are a longtime investment and a longtime commitment is 
needed to them

paris most celebrated prostitute lay in her coffin 
surrounded by flowers as faded as the era and admired by two men as 
jaded as the times 
manouches wake in the plush red parlor of the bordello is the 
beginning not the end of a friendship that introduces the 
soontobe scandalous author henry miller to the hedonistic 
pleasures of paris in the 1930s 
as you know it is a little my fault chuckles renowned french 
film director claude chabrol puffing on a pipe as he surveyed his 
gaudy vision of a prewar french cathouse 
i wanted to make a film on sex for a long time i didnt o it 
because i had other projects 
chabrol fulfills his fantasy in clichy days a film adapted 
from the baudy autobiographical novel quiet days in clichy by 
the author of tropic of cancer and tropic of capricorn 
the film is being shot on location in paris florence and rome 
and in a studio at cinecitta the italian hollywood on the outskirts 
of rome it is intended for release next summer 
i must say it is interesting now to make a film about sex 
because i think after the liberation of sexuality in the 70s it was 
very very childish now it seems to be a little more puritanical 
than before so i think now is a good moment to say that you can 
speak of sex without it being a dirty thing chabrol said 
another thing that is very interesting is the period the 
1930s it is in europe at the beginning of hitler and i must 
say the intellectuals in general and the american intellectuals in 
europe at that time didnt see anything they werent interested in 
those things at all i would like to show the character here who 
tries to find his own freedom his own lucidity and despite that he 
doesnt see what happens beside him 
chabrol cast 26yearold andrew mccarthy in the role of miller 
who at 42 was discovering the bohemian lifestyle of prewar paris 
indifferent to the sorrows of the depression at home and to the 
signs of impending war in europe 
well henry miller you dont get a chance to be henry miller 
very often said mccarthy who became a hero of the bubblegum set 
in such critical bombs as st elmos fire 
he is a notorious rogue it is a lot of fun i think it is fun 
because of chabrol 
i think he has an amazing knowledge of the cinema added 
nigel havers the british actor who plays alfred the friend who 
introduces miller to his new life in paris he shoots exactly what 
he wants and he knows exactly what he wants it is a wonderful way 
of working 
chabrols way of working has changed a lot since the young critic 
for cahiers du cinema led the new wave of french directors with his 
first film le beau serge in 1958 he gained international fame 
over the next few years with les cousins in 1959 and les 
bonnes femmes in 1960 
he suffered a string of commercially inspired critical failures 
in the early 1960s but later regained his reputation with such 
films as les biches and la femme infidele 
you know i have made too many films now even too many bad 
films now im almost an old man and i just do what i like 
thats all 
im not sure all my films will be good now but i am sure i 
want to do them it was not exactly the same thing in the past 
sometimes i accepted things said the 59yearold filmmaker 
millers quiet days in clichy he said offered him the 
chance to do at once the film on sex and several other projects he 
had in mind 
i had read it and remembered it as very wellwritten but really 
almost a pornographic book but i read it again and found exactly 
the things i wanted to make he said 
two years ago i had an idea to make a film about the american 
intellectuals especially those in the 30s i had at the same time 
another idea to make a film about a young girl of about 14 
the little girl is colette played by stephania cotta the 
15yearold granddaughter of manouche who ends up living with miller 
and alfred 
chabrol and cowriter ugo leonzio used the book as the basis but 
not a script for their screenplay 
if your read millers book it is really trashy he always 
changes reality he changes it to garbage and it is not the 
truth i dont like that so i changed the reality too 
but on the other side said chabrol that is why we have 
big sets and too beautiful things they are the other side of the 
lie

ray horne cursed the smoothasglass water in a 
35acre pothole on his farm even though he knew it made a rich 
wildlife breeding area 
that depression does no good for me except it might raise a 
pair of ducks he said as a farmer its no good for me 
horne wont be draining this wetland even though he has all the 
permits he needs instead next winter hell haul dirt onto the 
icecovered pond so when spring arrives mounds will sprout to 
produce ideal nesting habitat for ducks 
hornes change of heart comes at a price he and some neighbors 
are negotiating an agreement with the us fish and wildlife service 
that could pay them up to 40 an acre to raise ducks 
their willingness to negotiate officials say represents a real 
breakthrough in relations that could end the wetlands war north 
dakotas most controversial environmental issue 
the signal i think is that wildlife is able to sit down at 
the table not demanding that every wetland be preserved and 
agriculture is saying we dont want to drain and are willing to 
save some said lloyd jones state game and fish commissioner and 
former director of wetlands habitat for the fish and wildlife 
service that is something that didnt happen in the history of 
north dakota and is happening now 
unlike other states north dakota does not have serious problems 
with dirty water and air in fact other than draining wetlands the 
biggest environmental concern looming for the state is how to get 
rid of its garbage 
the wetlands war has pitted landowners against wildlife 
interests but the ramifications move the issue closer to urban 
consumers by affecting the quality of the wildlife habitat and water 
available for outdoor recreation 
before settlers pushed onto the prairie north dakota had 5 
million acres of wetlands marshy land teeming with wildlife just 2 
million acres remain jones said and he is determined to preserve 
them 
we are seeing a lot of things go wrong with 2 million acres and 
we cant get by with anything less he said 
wetlands act as a natural filter concentrating fertilizer and 
other runoff then releasing more polluted water into lakes and 
streams draining the bowllike indentations dotting the prairie in 
eastern north dakota has disrupted the areas hydrology and removed 
natural storage tanks increasing the chances of flooding jones 
said it also removed natural habitat for ducks and geese 
the drainage was spurred by farmers desire to plant on some of 
their most fertile soil the federal government even paid them at 
one time to drain their sloughs there was a strong public 
attitude that wetlands were wastelands jones said through the 
1970s farmers drained about 20000 acres a year 
by 1987 the legislature passed a law requiring that each acre 
drained had to be replaced the socalled nonetloss policy which 
took effect july 1 
i am real optimistic that the future for wetlands has never 
been better in north dakota jones said people are getting 
along a lot better now people trust each other a lot more now 
not everyone shares that optimism 
i dont know if there is a final solution said ramsey county 
commissioner lloyd stromme landowners in his area remain unhappy 
with the nonetloss law and want it repealed they are disgusted 
that the federal government obtains land without paying full taxes 
on it he sid 
state rep gordon berg whose critics call him mr draino 
for his support of wetland drainage says landowners must be paid 
for their potholes if you dont have the cooperation of the 
farmer youve got nothing 
mike mcenroe of the fish and wildlife service has been 
negotiating with horne and 29 other landowners for preservation of 
1500 acres of wetlands in return for payments of 15 to 40 an 
acre the exact amounts are still being discussed but an agreement 
could be signed within two months he said 
rather than fight with people we figured we would be much 
better off working toward the middle ground mcenroe said we 
are going kind of slow on this one because we want to find out how 
much it costs if it will work up here on a draining project of this 
size i think it can work anywhere 
horne driving around his land northwest of devils lake said the 
roads and trees have disrupted wetlands as much as draining 
potholes his agreement with the government will let him drain some 
of the smaller sloughs in return for preserving and enhancing the 
larger more valuable ones 
ill be your local inhouse manager and we will raise birds or 
whatever he said but i want to get paid for it

whatever else happens in the stock market over 
the next few months 1989 will go into the history books as the year 
the airlines took wing on wall street 
takeover bids for the parent companies of northwest and united 
have played a large part in transforming an industry long spurned by 
many investors into one of the hottest stock groups around 
that helped dow joness average of 20 transportation stocks reach 
new peaks weeks before the 30stock industrial average did so last 
week 
but theres more to the story than that and with all its 
positive and profitable moments some analysts say it could still 
have an unhappy ending 
nobody disputes that solid business reasons exist for the air 
transport industrys newfound popularity 
traffic fares and profits are up for most major carriers the 
era of bitter price competition that followed airline deregulation 
in the late 1970s appears to be over 
from its competitors point of view the strike that began in 
march at eastern airlines has made a bright situation even 
brighter observed the value line investment survey in its latest 
quarterly report on the group 
pulling easterns 6 percent capacity out of the system has 
produced a very favorable environment for raising airline fares 
wrote value line analyst paul graham 
airline stock enthusiasts cite several other pluses many 
airlines are described as better managed now than they used to be 
and the use of lease financing enables them to expand and modernize 
their fleets much more easily 
on top of all that the carriers have come to be seen as 
attractive to lenders and investors for the assets they own 
thats where some skeptics begin to voice their reservations 
about all the bidding and borrowing that has been taking place 
an airline is simply the wrong kind of company to qualify as a 
good candidate for a buyout financed with debt argues james grant 
in his newsletter grants interest rate observer 
airlines have heavy capitalspending requirements and unions to 
deal with and their business has always been very sensitive to the 
ups and downs of the economy 
every airline is a prisoner of the business cycle and a hostage 
to the price of fuel grant says 
we see in the airline liftoff yet another example of debt in 
action making the good times better and casting a shadow over the 
future we suspect that easy credit will sooner or later give way to 
hard or inaccessible credit 
adds graham at value line were concerned about the value 
being placed on these airline properties 
interest expense for example on borrowings to finance the nwa 
buyout will basically wipe out the carriers earnings in 1990 
thats not an encouraging performance in the strong operating 
environment were forecasting for next year 
in a recession if one of these debtladen carriers were to 
stumble badly we fear it could get quite messy 
moreover much of the alleged asset value in an airline eg 
lucrative route franchises can normally only be tapped by breaking 
up the company few unions will sit idly by while the dismantling is 
taking place 
we think airline stock performance will be very volatile in the 
next several months graham concluded accordingly we advise 
conservative investors to take refuge on the sidelines with those 
individuals who dont buy the airlinemerger story

a 20pound badger killed on a wyoming 
highway is spending the hereafter stuffed in a fierce pose mounted 
on wheels and racing hither and yon trying to scare some sense into 
overly friendly ferrets 
hes called robobadger by his handlers from the smithsonian 
institutions national zoo who hope his radiocontrolled scare 
tactics will help ferrets reared in captivity learn to protect 
themselves from predators when they are returned to the wild 
if robobadgers menacing lunges arent enough to instill fear 
zoo conservationists pelt the puzzled ferrets with rubber bands 
whose harmless stings usually encourage them to dive into the 
nearest hole 
another fearinspiring weapon is a stuffed owl with outstretched 
wings that swoops down on a handoperated pulley and string to buzz 
the sleek furry ferrets as they scamper over a dirt mound 
here in the foothills of the blue ridge mountains about 80 miles 
west of washington at a former training camp for us army cavalry 
troops scientists are conducting predatoravoidance training 
for ferrets at an outpost of the national zoo that is dedicated to 
saving endangered wildlife from extinction 
wildlife biologist brian miller says his project at the zoos 
conservation and research center is aimed at ensuring the survival 
of the north american blackfooted ferret which he calls one of 
the most endangered mammals in the world 
hundreds of thousands of these ferrets the chief predators of 
prairie dogs once lived in the vast arid grasslands of the west 
from southern canada to northern mexico but they fell victim to 
agricultural development and the federal governments program to 
eradicate grasseating prairie dogs as a threat to the livelihood of 
cattle ranchers 
deprived of their main source of food as well as shelter in 
prairie dog burrows the ferrets rapidly fell prey to disease and 
other predators such as great horned owls golden eagles and 
badgers by 1985 only 10 blackfooted ferrets remained all of them 
in wyoming 
they were quickly removed to the safety of captivity where 
breeding was begun today says miller there are 120 blackfooted 
ferrets at the wyoming game and fish research center at sybille 
canyon wyo the henry doorly zoo at omaha neb and at front 
royal 
they were raised in captivity and they know nothing about 
predators miller said in an interview 
they have never seen a badger will they duck when they see 
one will they run into a hole its one thing to be afraid and 
another thing to know what to do we want them to get into that hole 
as quickly as possible 
enter robobadger 
the badger was a road kill found lying alongside a wyoming 
highway at millers request it was hustled into a freezer and 
shipped across the country to washington where smithsonian 
taxidermist paul rhymer transformed it into a batteryoperated robot 
stuffed with ears bent back and front paws clawing as if chasing 
a prey the badger was mounted on the chassis of a toy truck with 
miniature tractor wheels and a tiny redtipped antenna for 
receiving radioed stopandgo and directional commands 
miller is experimenting first with 50 siberian polecats more 
populous first cousins of blackfooted ferrets from soviet asia 
which were bred from stock imported from the moscow zoo 
in the first couple months of testing the siberian ferrets seem 
mostly curious about robobadger but more frightened by the 
swooping owl 
once he has determined what ferrets know instinctively from their 
genetic memory about selfprotection feeding digging into 
burrows and other necessities in the wild miller will know what 
training in captivity is required to prepare the blackfooted 
variety for its return to the wild 
if the blackfooted ferrets make a comeback there he said other 
species of plant and animal life birds insects small mammals and 
shrubs may also flourish and help restore what was once a rich 
oasis of diversity in the ecosystem of prairie dog communities 
working in collaboration with the us fish and wildlife service 
wyoming game and fish officials and experts at north carolina state 
university miller hopes to give the ferrets their freedom in 
wyomings absoroka mountains adjacent to yellowstone park sometime 
in 1991 if the current population of 57 adults has grown to 200 by 
then 
theyve had a pretty hard time he said they deserve the 
best shot we can give them

some of the national rifle associations best 
friends are worried that the gun lobby may be shooting itself in the 
foot 
a conservative editor and activist says nra absolutism has kept 
it from cooperating with some of its natural allies among them 
conservative groups police organizations and in some cases 
republicans 
patrick b mcguigan writing in policy review a journal 
published by the conservative heritage foundation says that has cut 
into nra political clout and put the organization on the defensive 
many of the nras current difficulties are the result of 
selfinflicted wounds he writes during the past few years the 
organization has refused to play coalition politics with its natural 
allies in the conservative movement including most especially 
elements of organized law enforcement 
a goitalone approach and a refusal to compromise on less than 
critical issues is jeopardizing the nras effectiveness in winning 
political support on those issues that it considers most important 
the nra has been skirmishing with the republican administration 
in recent months over the governments decision to ban the importing 
of 43 types of semiautomatic assault weapons president bush signed 
that order july 7 congress is considering legislation that would 
impose new restrictions on usmade assault weapons 
after bush signed the permanent ban on imports the nra said some 
of its members wanted to kick him out of the organization bush who 
said during the 1988 campaign that he opposed federal gun control 
is a lifetime member of the nra a spokesman said he intended to 
remain one 
when the question of city or state gun controls came up wednesday 
at an informal news conference in kennebunkport maine bush said 
the people of portland and of maine should decide for themselves 
the constitution gives you certain rights in that regard he 
added what i want to get is strong support for our anticrime 
package stronger predictable sentencing tougher terms more 
judges more people to make those pay who are breaking the law 
the nra also took on william j bennett director of the office 
of national drug control policy who had recommended the ban james 
a warner an nra lawyer wrote that us servicemen would be 
deprived of their right to bring home assault weapons and suggested 
bennett might not understand because he was in graduate school 
during the height of the vietnam war 
while you may not be familiar with the life of a serviceman 
for many of these men the chance to bring home firearms while posted 
overseas is small recompense for the isolation the boredom and the 
risk of overseas duty warner wrote 
there have been more concrete nra rebukes to the republicans and 
the administration mcguigan says the nra and other gunowners 
groups contributed to the gop loss of the indiana house seat once 
held by vice president dan quayle and sat out a wyoming special 
election narrowly won by the republicans 
this double punishment of the gop probably served a useful 
purpose encouraging the bush administration to refocus its drug 
strategies more on crime control than on gun control mcguigan 
writes but it also weakened the party that has been most 
sympathetic to the nra overall and showed a spitefulness toward the 
bush administration with which it probably should be cooperating 
not fighting 
mcguigan also complains that the nra refused to join forces with 
conservatives working for senate confirmation of robert h borks 
nomination to the supreme court in 1987 as one of the strategists 
who sought to secure borks confirmation i know we badly needed the 
nras help and didnt get it 
mcguigan says the nra apparently was unwilling to help bork for 
fear that he would oppose the suppression of evidence obtained 
during investigations and searches that might involve firearms 
dealers he also quotes an nra official as saying the white house 
didnt want an early endorsement of bork from the controversial gun 
group 
but by his account other singleinterest conservative groups 
took up the bork campaign even though their positions and his were 
not in total accord 
by failing to admit the possibility of regulations that do not 
limit the basic right to bear arms the nra is cutting itself off 
from a broader movement of judicial reform mcguigan says 
he says the organization may be moving in that direction now his 
heritage foundation piece reads like an effort to encourage just 
that 
americas voters will give strong support to a political 
coalition that can push through reform measures to keep dangerous 
offenders off the streets mcguigan concludes the nra can play 
a very important role in this coalition and in so doing channel gun 
control into its proper direction

a 62 billion offer for the parent of united 
airlines is the biggest takeover yet proposed by marvin davis but 
the beverly hills billionaire exwildcatter and glitzy deli owner 
has other deals cooking too 
even as davis awaited ual corps response this past week his 
closeknit group searched for other undervalued companies and 
eyeballed europe as a possible hunting ground 
davis son john a harvard mba whose computer research backs up 
his fathers business instincts said davis is looking abroad now 
that so many us companies have been bought or dissected by the 
1980s takeover frenzy 
he suggested that sir james goldsmiths 21 billion offer for 
britains bat industries plc may set the agenda for davis and other 
investors 
europe now is where this country was in 1980 said john 
davis 34 
his father 63 faces probable counteroffers for ual by uniteds 
pilots and the team of british airways and the morgan stanley amp co 
investment firm 
he declined to be interviewed but in written responses to 
questions from the associated press he said the greatest threat to 
the us economy is in our failing to recognize that we are 
today in a truly global economy 
american companies will have to be intensely competitive to 
succeed in the years to come davis said they will have to be 
managed by the best trained and motivated people provided with a 
steady flow of capital and operate without any illusion about the 
fact that we are no longer the preeminent force in many 
industries 
neither father nor son will reveal exactly where they are looking 
next though john davis said newspapers magazines television 
stations and hotelcasino outfits cant be ruled out 
at 6foot5 and about 300 pounds marvin davis is known as a 
fierce dealmaker and one of the worlds wealthiest businessmen 
estimated to be worth 17 billion by fortune magazine 
he seems unlikely to lose the fascination with glamour industries 
he has shown since cashing out of the oil business in the early 80s 
just before the industry slumped 
davis was denvers mr wildcatter in the 1970s paying huge 
commissions to top geologists while convincing other oil companies 
to absorb much of the risk and cost for the drilling 
he purchased 20th century fox film corp for 720 million most 
of it borrowed with a partner in 1981 then bought singer kenny 
rogers beverly hills estate the knoll for more than 20 
million 
fox faltered under his leadership partly because of flops like 
rhinestone dolly parton teamed with sylvester stallone who 
played a singing new york cab driver but when davis sold to rupert 
murdoch after four years he netted 325 million 
davis has unsuccessfully pursued such highprofile companies as 
cbs inc lorimar telepictures corp and this year northwest 
airlines parent nwa inc he teamed with prudential insurance co to 
snag spectradyne inc a big provider of payperview movies in 
hotel rooms for 635 million 
he paid 136 million to the family of nowconvicted speculator 
ivan boesky in december 1986 to buy the beverly hills hotel the 
pink landmark where he had honeymooned with his wife barbara 
within a year he sold the hotel to the sultan of brunei the 
worlds wealthiest person for a 65 million profit 
although davis generally avoids the press he seems to have a 
hankering for hollywood happenings and celebrity friends 
when he opened his beverly hills version of new yorks carnegie 
deli in july george burns milton berle john madden and wayne 
gretzky watched as carol channing plopped a monster matzo ball into 
a vat of chicken soup 
john davis acknowledges the family wont be looking much at 
industries unless they are fun 
we probably wont buy a chemical company he said 
at any given time davis group is analyzing two or three 
industries where undervalued companies may be found john davis said 
he said the airline industry was targeted because it had 
stabilized after the trauma of deregulation the davis group 
especially liked united and northwest because of their strength in 
the booming pacific rim region 
more often than not davis has profited enormously by buying 
stock in a company making a buyout offer that raises the price 
then selling his stake to a higher bidder 
for example he initially offered 27 billion to buy nwa but 
eventually was outbid by investor alfred checchis 365 billion 
deal in june davis made 30 million 
but john davis insists the davises seriously want to buy when 
they bid and bid only after rigorous analysis 
weve spent too much time and effort on the airlines industry 
2 years of work and millions and millions and millions of dollars 
worth of bank fees consultant fees investment banking fees legal 
fees he said 
you know we wouldnt have spent all this money if we were just 
interested in putting a company in play and making a profit 
likewise marvin davis counters critics who say he and other 
takeover strategists are motivated by greedy speculation rather than 
longterm investment goals 
we are businessmen and builders davis said we started 
with an industrial base building and developing a major oil and gas 
exploration company the companies we have bought for example 
aspen skiing co and the pebble beach co have been expanded and 
enhanced under our ownership 
equally important our companies are contributing citizens of 
the communities in which they operate from a philanthropic social 
and economic point of view he said 
davis own philanthropy is extensive he established the 
childrens diabetes foundation in denver and the lavish carousel 
ball that supports it his donations to the foundation the barbara 
davis center for childhood diabetes a geriatrics care facility in 
denver and a research center at cedarssinai medical center in los 
angeles total tens of millions of dollars 
but if his generosity has made many friends his sharp business 
instincts have perhaps inevitably bred conflict 
former 20th century fox chairman dennis stanfill resigned soon 
after davis bought fox claiming interference he filed a 40 
million breachofcontract suit later settled out of court 
a suit pending in houston federal court alleges davis cheated 
investors out of 40 million by taking leftover drilling supplies 
from their oil wells in a fraud suit pending in denver federal 
court aetna life amp casualty co claims davis misrepresented energy 
properties in which aetna had invested 
davis has called the suits fallacious and without merit 
through it all nothing seems to dampen the optimism that 
motivated him in his wildcatter days friends say davis and his wife 
love hollywood where they remain on whats known as the social 
alist linda evans gregory peck and milton berle attended 
their christmas party last year 
i think hes really enjoying this new episode in his life 
said former president gerald ford a longtime family friend 
investor and golf partner 
ford noted that davis business instinct boils over onto the golf 
links where they compete for a couple of dollars here and there

this is one of a series of periodic reports 
looking ahead to western europe in 1992 when the 12 nations of the 
european economic community remove their trade barriers and 
interlock their policies and goals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the european economic community is fast 
shedding its role as solely a trading bloc of west european nations 
to assume a more prominent place in foreign affairs 
the dozen nations that make up the community also known as the 
common market are virtually certain to take more political stands 
as their economies become tightly linked at the end of 1992 
analysts say 
that may well mean a diminished role for the united states in 
europe and perhaps beyond they say 
its a bit inevitable that where the united states was once the 
only and therefore dominant initiator and influence in these 
matters it will be an equal or one of many nations said richard 
fieldhouse research fellow at the stockholm international peace 
research institute in sweden 
encouraging the european closeness is the drive by the eec to 
remove by dec 31 1992 the many trade barriers separating the 
members 
the aim of 1992 is to create a single market in which people 
money goods and services can move freely among member nations 
belgium britain denmark france west germany greece ireland 
italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal and spain 
the 12 nations with a whopping 320 million consumers can wield 
much more economic power together than individually so too in 
world affairs 
the completion of the internal market will undoubtedly have 
external implications said willy de clercq who formerly was the 
communitys top foreign affairs official 
the object of the game is not just economic integration said 
peter ludlow director of the center for european policy studies a 
brusselsbased think tank it is only part of a general design 
to create a european union 
some measure of greater political cooperation will be had 
how and to what degree all depends on the shape of economic 
integration said alfred kingon the former us ambassador to the 
eec 
a recent poll by the european commission the communitys 
executive body indicated that 72 percent of the europeans 
questioned felt the community should handle foreign policy issues a 
little more than half said it should also decide security and 
defense matters 
you cant exclude closer cooperation in security questions if 
you really want to realize a united states of europe said charles 
goerens president of the legislative arm of the western european 
union a forum for foreign and defense ministers that discusses 
security issues 
with their unity push western europeans are gaining a stronger 
sense of identity and becoming less dependent on the united states 
long their protector against a possible threat from the soviet union 
the united states appears more willing at least to analysts on 
this side of the atlantic ocean to give up its oncesupreme 
position in the north atlantic treaty organization the western 
military alliance 
they point in part to increased grumbling in the us congress 
that americans are paying too much and europeans not enough of 
the costs for the common western defense with the federal budget 
crunch there will be more pressure to pare the us contribution 
they also note president bushs endorsement of the european 
bonding 
let me say clearly a stronger europe a more united europe is 
good for my country he said in a july speech in the netherlands 
and its a development we welcome a natural evolution within our 
alliance the product of true partnership 40 years in the making 
the communitys world standing got an unexpected lift in july 
when bush and leaders of other rich democracies put it in charge of 
coordinating economic aid for poland and hungary 
the move which delighted community officials was seen as a sign 
of their growing importance 
it was a brilliant stroke on the part of the united states 
said kingon 
community spokesman clausdieter ehlermann said the assignment 
was certainly the biggest boost and also the greatest challenge 
for the eec in foreign relations 
we have never been charged before with coordinating the 
activities of countries outside the 12

officials of two dozen western nations met in brussels in early 
august to take an initial look at ways to help poland and hungary 
the talks produced pledges of emergency food aid to shortageplagued 
poland more discussions will be held in the fall 
the community was given the job most likely because of its 
contacts with the east it has shown a keen interest in taking 
advantage of the changes under way in its east bloc neighbors to 
strengthen economic and political ties 
in june 1988 it signed a declaration establishing official 
relations with the sovietled economic bloc called the council for 
mutual economic assistance also known by the acronym comecon it 
brought to an end three decades of estrangement between europes 
economic halves 
since then the eec has signed or initialed trade agreements with 
hungary czechoslovakia and poland negotiations are under way with 
the soviet union and bulgaria 
at a summit in june the leaders of the 12 member countries made 
known their desire to play an active role in encouraging reforms in 
eastern europe 
they also acted together to sanction china for its crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators and urged a negotiated solution to the 
middle east conflict 
earlier in the year they recalled their ambassadors from iran to 
protest the ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis appeal for the death of 
the author salman rushdie who holds british citizenship 
that action was agreed on at a regular monthly meeting of foreign 
ministers gatherings that have become an important feature of 
community life 
the governments also coordinate their views by issuing 
statements under the title european political cooperation on the 
troubles of the day whether in burma in asia or the middle east a 
tiny epc office opened in brussels in 1987 issues about four or 
five statements a month 
the 12 have a common position in almost every single problem in 
the world said one community official 
yet its unclear how much farther the community can go 
further steps might be limited if neutral austria bridging the 
east and the west in europe were to join in a recent letter 
applying for membership the austrian government insisted on 
safeguarding its neutrality 
even so the soviet union has expressed concern eec membership 
would not be exclusively economic the kremlin said 
ireland which entered the community in 1973 also is neutral 
its status has not yet been troublesome although it might be were 
the community to expand forcefully into defense and security 
matters ireland unlike other community members does not belong to 
nato 
the western european union was revived in 1984 to bring together 
european foreign and defense ministers to tackle security issues 
defense chiefs do not meet within the eec 
acting through the union in 1987 the nations sent naval 
minesweeping forces to the persian gulf in the iraniraq war 
we have to become the european pillar of nato said goerens 
who is also a luxembourg legislator 
belgium britain france west germany italy luxembourg and the 
netherlands are members of the organization spain and portugal will 
join shortly all belong to nato

more guards hightech security devices and drugsniffing dogs 
will greet children in urban and rural schools alike this fall as 
officials struggle to curb spreading violence and vandalism 
security budgets have doubled even tripled in many districts in 
recent years and now total in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
nationwide a 50state check by the associated press found 
new york city alone with its 1000 schools and nearly 1 million 
pupils will spend 60 million on security this coming school year 
double what it spent eight years ago los angeles the second 
largest district spends 26 million 
the spending relates not just to weapons gangs and drugs but 
also to the hightech revolution that has loaded schools with vcrs 
and computers that need protection 
the more we get into computers and things of that sort 
equipment that is really expensive naturally we want to protect 
that said billy randall assistant superintendent of the 
greenwood public schools in greenwood miss which recently 
installed sophisticated burglar alarms 
some districts still insist school life is as peaceful as ever 
we have none of those kinds of problems you read about in the 
big cities said joe zema attorney for the topeka kan school 
district where security isnt even an identifiable item in the 
budget 
but elsewhere drug and gang problems are finally forcing 
formerly placid school districts to hire guards and install 
sophisticated security hardware some officials now worry that such 
measures may make their schools feel like prisons or armed camps 
bill hanebuth head of the mobile ala county education 
association called it a little unnerving to think local schools 
might resemble new yorks or chicagos but with 15 teachers 
assaulted by students last school year he and other alabamians seem 
to agree sterner security measures are in order 
its gotten beyond the day of just the fire drill weve got to 
be prepared for the extreme because thats what we face said max 
joiner executive director of the alabama council for school 
administration and supervision which began security workshops last 
year 
were deliberately trying to avoid letting our schools become 
armed camps said ac boyd director of security for new orleans 
schools which nonetheless will add a drugsniffing dog this year to 
its arsenal of handheld metal detectors topoftheline locks 
high fences and burglar alarms 
no figures exist on how much the nations schools spend each year 
on security but a check of districts in all 50 states found the 
figure is certainly in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
we do know that the trend is up and its related to drug 
activity and gangs and possession of weapons said ronald d 
stephens executive director of the national school safety center at 
pepperdine university 
the dade county school district which includes miami will spend 
103 million on security for the 198990 school year about 18 
million more than last year and 4 million more than five years 
ago said red mcallister director of investigations 
philadelphia will spend 104 million nearly double the 55 
million spent in the 198384 school year 
boston will spend 22 million on safety this school year and may 
start using metal detectors said school committee member john nucci 
we have real concerns for this coming school year the gang 
problem and guns on the street find their way to the schools 
nucci said 
ninetyseven percent of new york citys 60 million school 
security budget is for guards said bruce irushalmi director of the 
office of school safety the city also plans to introduce metal 
detectors into 15 schools up from five 
fairfax county va where a thirdgrader was raped last year 
has hired eight new security employees and will issue photo ids to 
all elementary and intermediate staff who travel to schools 
chicagos school system the nations third largest spends 125 
million a year and has 723 security positions 
the muskogee okla district hired two parttime security guards 
last year for about 30000 after a student with a handgun 
accidentally wounded a fellow student in a high school class 
little rock ark officials say they plan to raise the profile 
of security officers and possibly use a drugsniffing dog following 
last years shooting death of a student on a junior high basketball 
court 
officials insist all this spending is creating safer more secure 
schools 
daryl r harrell school security director of albuquerque nm 
said vandalism losses dropped from 500000 to 80000 with the help 
of an electronic surveillance alarm system 
in jefferson county colo which includes denver school 
officials claim burglaries and vandalism have declined by 50 percent 
since the installation of stateoftheart security systems 
featuring motion detectors 
in new york city irushalmi says the number of violent or serious 
incidents has decreased from 15500 to 9000 since security spending 
doubled 
some argue still more spending is needed as gang violence and the 
crack epidemic spread 
many districts are not getting new money to handle these 
issues yet more and more is being asked of us said peter 
blauvelt school security chief of prince georges county md and 
president of the national association of school security directors 
clark county nev which includes las vegas wanted to raise 
property taxes to increase its school security staff from 22 to 40 
officers following a school year marred by gang violence the murder 
of a high school student and the rape and kidnapping of a 
12yearold elementary school pupil the state legislature refused 
to put the measure to the voters 
i cannot for the life of me understand why a legislature would 
be unwilling to let the people of a county vote on whether they 
wanted to raise the money to pay for the safety of kids said 
clark county school board president dan newburn 
ed mcfadden security chief in mobile county ala said he is 
seeking a 150000 increase in the 430000 security budget to put 
unarmed guards in high schools 
our biggest concern in campus security is how to keep students 
from bringing guns to school mcfadden said in 198889 146 
students were suspended for weapons possession including 30 cases 
involving guns 
milwaukees school security budget has doubled in five years to 
1 million and will rise by 300000 in 198990 said safety 
director gerald mourning new this year security systems to protect 
cars from theft and vandalism and closed circuit tv monitors in 15 
elementary schools in high crime areas 
beyond guards and hardware seattle and milwaukee are offering 
anger management classes to teach youngsters alternatives to 
violence the course was tested last year in four milwaukee schools 
and will expand this year to four to six more

the greenwood sc school district has spent 90000 to install 
intercoms and a fence around an elementary school where an intruder 
last year shot and killed two thirdgraders and wounded seven other 
students and two teachers 
weapons drugrelated violence thefts and gang problems have 
spread to smalltown schools leading authorities to try the same 
hightech security hardware innercity schools rely on a 50state 
associated press survey has found 
we have to be conscious of security in small districts a lot 
more than we used to be said superintendent luis montoya in 
clifton ariz where a rash of breakins forced the district to 
triple its security outlays in the last five years 
the effort is mainly to protect new vcrs computers tape 
recorders and camera equipment another problem is siphoning of 
gasoline from school buses 
in central michigan the mason school district spends about 
3000 a year on motion detector equipment to protect computers at 
the middle and high schools 
compared to five years ago we didnt have that kind of 
equipment we didnt have that volume of computer equipment to 
protect said superintendent glenn doran 
the 1900student perryton independent school district in the 
texas panhandle pays about 5000 a year for drugsniffing dogs and 
250 for security lighting so far those measures havent turned up 
much spokesman randy barnes acknowledged 
we found a pill once that looked pretty suspicious but it 
turned out to be a contac capsule he said 
in yankton sd school authorities prefer a hard line on school 
crime to security hardware 
a 15yearold boy convicted of making a false bomb threat wound 
up serving time at the state training school and an 18yearold was 
sentenced to one year in the yankton detention center for a similar 
threat 
not every rural school is worried 
several years ago in an incident that drew national attention 
an armed gunman took an entire school of children hostage in 
cokeville wyo but state superintendent lynn simons said the 
incident was an aberration and it didnt change his approach to 
security 
we can rest easy in wyoming we just dont have to worry about 
those problems said simons 
in eatonville wash high school principal randy dorn knows his 
kids sometimes bring weapons to school but he says its only 
during hunting season

youre staying at a radisson hotel and craving 
pizza you spot a card on the nightstand advertising pizza delivery 
a call brings a pipinghot pie to the door delivered by a person 
wearing what appears to be a pizza chains outfit 
it isnt 
though hotel guests might assume they are ordering pizza from an 
outlet outside the hotel such as dominos or pizza hut theyre 
not the pizza is baked in the same hotel kitchen that makes regular 
roomservice orders and is delivered by a room service employee 
disguised as a pizza delivery person 
why the subterfuge 
don clawson vice president of food services for radisson hotels 
international said the hotels had to overcome the perception among 
travelers that a roomservice pizza isnt as good as one from a 
pizza parlor so the company decided to pattern its pizza delivery 
on dominos 
to be perfectly honest we dont tell the customer its from 
room service said clawson if they ask we would tell them we 
are not dishonest about it if they dont ask we dont tell them 
radisson developed the inhouse pizza idea in 1985 after company 
president john norlander noticed the number of empty dominos boxes 
lining the halls of a radisson hotel during a company business 
conference 
the minneapolisbased hotel chains inhouse pizza delivery 
service used to be called pizzawe deliver the pizza was 
offered through room service and sales were disappointing clawson 
said 
radissons new pizza service is named napolizza the pizza 
with pizzazz after the italian city of napoli which claims to be 
the birthplace of pizza the napolizza phone number is separate from 
room services and is listed prominently among pizza delivery 
services in the rooms telephone directory 
radisson room service employees who deliver pizza wear a nylon 
jacket baseball cap and polo shirt emblazoned with the napolizza 
logo the pie is delivered in a pizza box or in a hot wrap a 
thermal insulated carrying case 
like dominos the napolizza pizza comes with discount coupons 
for future purchases the pizza is delivered within 29 minutes or 
its free one minute less than dominos 30minute delivery 
guarantee 
not everyone is fooled by the illusion clawson said 
it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that hotels 
dont allow freestanding restaurants to advertise in the rooms 
very often he said 
about 45 of the 110 us radisson hotels offer the service 
clawson said sales average 4045 pizzas daily per hotel almost 2 
times the number sold under radissons old program and dominos 
sales at the hotels have been cut significantly he said 
a good many of the 1400 holiday inns in the united states 
have an inhouse pizza program but theres no attempt to disguise 
the pizzas origin said ginny troutt a spokeswoman for the 
memphisbased chain 
we noticed a lot of pizza boxes in guest rooms she said 
we thought why not offer a pizza 
ron hingst a spokesman for dominos pizza inc of ann arbor 
mich said the company isnt concerned about being imitated 
we wish them luck imitations the best form of flattery 
hingst said adding that dominos hasnt noticed an impact on sales 
at hotels that offer inhouse pizzas

integrated resources inc a struggling financial 
services company says it has reached a tentative agreement to sell 
part of its holdings for 310 million to the familyowned whitehall 
financial group partnership 
the price is about 20 million to 30 million below the low end 
of the range that integrated resources executives had predicted to 
creditors that the assets might fetch arthur goldberg integrateds 
cochief executive said thursday in an interview 
nevertheless goldberg said he believed the announcement showed 
that integrated resources was taking credible steps toward raising 
money to make payments on its 175 billion in debt 
integrated has not paid any principle or interest to creditors 
since june when it declared a moratorium because of deepening 
financial troubles 
integrated said last week it would try to sell its core financial 
service companies for 450 million to 525 million but whitehall 
was interested in only part of the holdings goldberg said 
since the offer came in below projections integrated said it 
would continue to solicit bidders for them but would pay whitehall 
a 4 million breakup fee if their deal was dropped goldberg said 
other parties are interested in the parts of the business whitehall 
did not want goldberg said 
whitehall is half owned by members of the de gunzburg branch of 
the bronfman family of canada heirs to the seagram ltd distilling 
fortune and half by the moross family of london which has 
extensive financial services interests whitehall has holdings in 
life insurance and property and casualty brokerage 
whitehall would buy integrated resources life insurance co 
integrated resources equity corp integrated resources asset 
management corp resources trust co and financial clearing and 
services corp 
the sale price would be 297 million plus a portion of tax 
benefits received by the core companies after the sale that would 
raise the total purchase price to 310 million 
whitehall would not buy integrateds capitol life insurance co 
its taxsheltered annuity business its ordinary life insurance 
business or united resources 
after the spinoff of subsidiaries integrateds main business 
would be management of existing public and private limited 
partnerships and real estate investment trusts

stock market analysts say the risk of a financial 
meltdown is far lower today than it was two years ago the last time 
the dow jones industrial average was in record territory 
a 5653point leap in the dow jones average thursday carried it 
to 273464 surpassing the record of 272242 that was set 
precisely two years ago today 
the 1987 peak was the start of a short but severe bear market 
that culminated in the worst day in wall street history the 
508point plunge in the dow jones industrials on oct 19 1987 
evidence of that debacle was hard to find thursday 
the quote of the day is something like what crash said 
robert brusca chief economist of nikko securities co international 
inc the new york arm of a japanese brokerage firm 
supporting the stock market in 1989 are a healthy dollar 
relatively low interest rates and optimism that the economy will 
manage to steer a middle course between recession and high inflation 
most of all there is no speculative bubble ready to be popped 
stock prices are far lower in relation to underlying company profits 
than they were two years ago said lawrence kudlow chief economist 
at bear stearns amp co 
fundamentally this is a great expression of confidence in the 
whole us economic outlook kudlow said we keep throwing 
negatives at the market and they dont stick 
added david m jones chief economist at the brokerage firm 
aubrey g lanston amp co essentially the stock market is telling 
us that a soft landing is in store for the economy and thats 
exactly the slowdown you need to keep inflation from accelerating 
while some other strategists are more skeptical about the 
economys health a market rally can sometimes feed on itself 
regardless of fundamental factors 
the worst thing that can happen to an institutional money 
manager is to sit there with a pile of cash and watch the market 
take off with out him its a buying panic said lawrence r 
helfand managing director for retail sales at the chicago brokerage 
rodman amp renshaw inc 
thursdays gain was the secondbiggest of the year and it came 
in the heaviest trading since midjune a good sign for the market 
volume on the new york stock exchange totaled 22552 million shares 
there was no economic news thursday to account for the big jump 
bonds were up slightly and the dollar edged higher 
the markets going up just on its own when you call around 
theres no reason it just went up brusca said 
from its low point at the close of black monday to its close 
thursday the dow jones industrial average which represents the 
stock of 30 major companies rose 57 percent 
while nobodys paid much attention to it its two of the 
strongest years back to back that weve had helfand said

two years ago today the new york stock exchange 
closed at an alltime high two months later the market crashed 
the resurgent dow jones industrials average on thursday finally 
cracked its 1987 record but few if any market professionals believe 
that history will repeat itself 
you didnt have the euphoric buying all summer long this 
year said peter blatchford a 27yearold market maker on the 
options floor its based on sound economic news the economy is 
stronger than people thought 
in stark contrast with the gogo days of summer 1987 this years 
rise to new record highs has been slow and steady 
everyone knows what the monster looks like and theyre looking 
over their shoulders to see him said robert w seijas a partner 
in a stock exchange member firm 
traders spilled out of the exchange at wall and new streets after 
the closing bell thursday as on any other day but this time the dow 
jones industrials average had finished at a record 273464 
surpassing its reading of 272242 on aug 25 1987 
the rise in the closely watched measure 30 key industrial company 
stocks is considered the final symbolic sign on wall street of the 
steady recovery since the 1987 crash which saw the dow plunge 508 
points on oct 19 1987 other key indexes shattered record highs 
earlier this summer 
the dow flirted with the record several times earlier this month 
breaking through the top number but ending the day lower 
a subdued cheer rose from the exchange floor after the close 
thursday 
a day like every other day no big deal said peter mancuso 
a specialist with albert fried amp co there was no question in 
everybodys mind that the market would get back to these levels it 
just needed some time 
market players said the difference between 1987 and 1989 lies in 
the economys strength with inflation apparently under control and 
interest rates gradually heading lower the nonrecessionary soft 
landing many economists have been predicting 
they did say cracking the old record was significant because on 
wall street psychological barriers are important thanks to the 
economys strength optimism remains the vanguard on the street 
the market seems to want to go higher said alfred smith a 
specialist with ac partners the further away you get from the 
crash the better it is

the proposed 22 billion sale of holiday 
inns inc would make bass plc of great britain the worlds largest 
hotel manager and clear the way for parent holiday corp to 
concentrate on its casinos and newer hotel chains market observers 
say 
holiday corp is poised for substantial growth in their new 
form and with a much better balance sheet said marvin roffman a 
market analyst with the philadelphia brokerage janney montgomery 
scott inc 
holiday the memphisbased parent of holiday inns announced the 
proposed sale thursday prompting the companys stock to jump 6 a 
share to close at 83 on the new york stock exchange 
the price received for the holiday inn brand was a very solid 
valuation of about 13 times pretax cashflow that looks pretty 
attractive considering its a taxfree transaction to holiday 
corp said john lawrence a market analyst with the brokerage 
morgan keegan amp co of memphis 
the sale must be approved by shareholders of both companies 
ralph berry a spokesman for holiday corp said no dates have been 
set for shareholder meetings to vote on the proposal 
holiday corp said it would form a new subsidiary to run its 
profitable hotelcasino company harrahs and its newer hotel 
chains embassy suites hampton inn and homewood suites 
it clearly focuses the company in the highgrowth segments of 
the hotel business roffman said 
holiday said its newer hotel brands have grown to the point that 
they compete with holiday inn in the marketplace and for attention 
within the corporation 
under the proposed sale agreement holiday stockholders would get 
onequarter share of bass stock for each of their holiday shares 
worth a total of about 125 million they also would get a 
35ashare dividend from the new holiday subsidiary 
in addition they would get one share in the new subsidiary for 
each of their holiday shares and lawrence said that stock would be 
worth 45 to 55 a share 
the sale will allow holiday corp to shed 21 billion in debt 
which will be assumed by bass much of the debt stems from the 
companys recapitalization in 1987 which allowed the company to pay 
shareholders an extra dividend to ward of a takeover threat by new 
york developer donald j trump berry said 
as a result of that the new company when its spun off will be 
virtually debtfree it will then borrow or finance new borrowing to 
pay the dividend he said 
with the sale bass will acquire 55 owned or leased holiday inns 
as well as franchise agreements joint venture agreements and 
management contracts covering about 1400 other holiday inns in 
north america 
last year bass bought the rights to franchise holiday inn hotels 
outside north america and the company is a major franchisee in 
canada bass already owns 14 holiday inns in the southeast united 
states 
bass has more than 7300 pubs and other food and drink outlets in 
the united kingdom the company also brews bass carling black label 
and other beers it has annual sales approaching 6 billion 
the british company is expected to keep holiday inns north 
american headquarters in memphis berry said and holiday corp 
employees now working for holiday inn will become bass employees

fines totaling 550000 against a top commodities 
trader and his firm are a sign of increased internal policing in the 
face of a federal investigation of new yorks futures markets 
industry experts say 
the commodity exchange on thursday fined and suspended the 
trader preston h semel for violating trading rules semel is one 
of the targets of the governments criminal and civil probes of new 
yorks commodity markets 
its a very large fine and its probably making a statement 
that what he did was bad and trying to tell the rest of comex to be 
careful said thomas russo a commodities lawyer and former 
chairman of the federal commodity futures trading commission 
the fines against semel and semel amp co a brokerage in gold 
silver and other commodities were believed to be the largest in 
exchange history officials said 
semel was cited for internal trading rules violations that also 
are being examined in civil and criminal probes at comex and three 
other exchanges announced in may by the cftc and justice department 
the probes are unrelated to a longstanding probe of chicagos 
commodity markets that recently yielded 46 indictments for 
racketeering and fraud 
a government official familiar with the new york investigations 
confirmed thursday that semel is one of many traders whose 
actions are being examined the official who asked not to be named 
said the probes include the same types of violations cited by comex 
more than 50 traders received subpoenas and federal authorities 
are examining boxes of documents provided by the exchanges and 
traders defense lawyers said thursday no action in the federal 
probe is expected for at least two months lawyers said 
the official familiar with the criminal probe said investigators 
from the manhattan us attorneys office and the us postal 
service are examining documents subpoenaed by the cftc 
weve still got a while to go on the criminal case the 
official said 
comex spokesman robert mcgrath said semel was fined 350000 and 
suspended for nine months from the exchange while semel amp co was 
fined 200000 
the violations by semel involve improper crosstrading and 
prohibited dual trading two offenses that center on trading for 
customers and personal accounts 
semel 39 and his firm also were cited under exchange rules for 
misconduct disreputable or fraudulent conduct and conduct 
detrimental to the exchange 
comex guidelines regarding the two stated trading violations bar 
traders from taking the opposite side of an order received and from 
trading for personal accounts while holding a customers order for 
the same commodity 
officials said the charges listed generally involve a practice 
know as frontrunning getting an unfair advantage by trading 
for personal accounts ahead of customer orders for the same 
commodity that pracice is under scrutiny in the federal probes 
a person answering the telephone thursday at semel amp co said no 
one would be available for comment 
the cftc probe reportedly examines violations including 
prearranged trading using advance knowledge of customer trades to 
trade for personal accounts and conducting trades in order to skirt 
tax obligations 
the criminal probe reportedly includes examination of alleged 
frontrunning at the exchanges and whether brokers and traders 
illegally shared information with each other about customer orders 
comex issued a complaint against semel a powerful figure on the 
exchange floor in june 1988 for trading that took place before 
then mcgrath said he refused to release other details about the 
internal probe 
semel was expected to appeal the penalty to the cftc but 
spokeswoman kate hathaway said he had not yet done so 
in addition to the comex the government in may issued subpoenas 
to the new york mercantile exchange the coffee sugar and cocoa 
exchange and the cotton exchange

young healthy and hungry for a 
new start in the west thousands of newly arrived east german 
refugees are snapping up bluecollar jobs spurned by west germans 
they wont have any trouble integrating themselves here said 
olaf sund head of the north rhinewestphalia labor office as he 
surveyed hundreds of escapees filling out applications or scanning 
job notices at the refugee reception center here 
they are young eager and in many cases welltrained sund 
said they were the future of east germany 
more than 65000 east germans have fled to west germany this 
year emigrating legally in record numbers and escaping through 
hungarys recently relaxed borders at a rate unequaled since 1961 
when the berlin wall staunched the last rush to the west 
west germanys main reception center in giessen became so crowded 
last week that officials opened a new post outside this village near 
muenster to handle the overflow 
the schoeppingen center opened less than a week ago but word of 
the willing workforce has spread fast 
handlettered signs offering manuallabor jobs are posted by the 
dozens on the chainlink fences surrounding the barracks that on 
thursday housed 900 east germans nearly all of whom had escaped 
illegally through hungary 
the more aggressive employers cruise by the camp in luxury cars 
to offer a ride as well as a workplace one woman in a mercedes with 
cologne license plates said she was searching for a livein maid 
in building no 7 of the crowded but orderly encampment is a 
makeshift branch of the state employment office neat rows of job 
notices offer immediate work for plumbers cooks roofers painters 
and other tradesmen 
it makes no difference to me where i go to work said 
burkhard schmidt a printer from dresden bused here two days ago 
after a harrowing escape with his family that twice landed him in 
hungarian jails i just want to get a place to live and get my 
family settled 
wolfgang handschuch of the regional employment office in nearby 
coesfeld said nearly 200 jobs had been called in to the camp during 
each of the past few days 
the eager offerings from employers who have long sought manual 
laborers as well as the urgency felt by escapees who want to get 
started in new jobs has resulted in a chaotic matchmaking system 
handschuch said the handful of government labor advisers at the 
camp can do little to verify either the prospective employees 
qualifications or the employers working conditions 
there are some people who come here with expectations of the 
golden west where everyone immediately has a job a car and a 
beautiful home handschuch said but i would say most are 
realistic about their chances 
ingrid meyer a 44yearold magdeburg resident who ran a 
restaurant until she applied to emigrate four years ago said she 
was confident she and her husband would be settled soon 
there are so many jobs for food service people here we hadnt 
expected such a wealth of choice she said 
east germans are more easily assimilated in west germany than 
their east bloc neighbors because of the common language and 
relative familiarity with western lifestyles west german tv can be 
seen in most parts of east germany 
the transition is tougher for ethnic germans emigrating from the 
soviet union and poland 
harry meisel head of the labor department in badenwuerttemberg 
state said his office placed a soviet chef who couldnt adjust to 
the restaurants supplies language problems aside he had seldom 
worked with more than salt and pepper for seasonings 
many east german immigrants have insufficient education or 
experience to go directly into their fields especially in 
computerrelated work said andreas mausch spokesman for the 
federal labor ministry in bonn 
but in the long term with some additional training the 
outlook is very good he said these people want to stay here 
and build careers 
mausch said there were more than 255000 jobs open in bluecollar 
fields that employers had called in to state employment offices 
obviously there are a great many others that we dont even know 
about he said 
signs offering waitress or janitorial work can be seen in the 
windows of shops in virtually every west german city as even young 
west germans resist jobs that are menial or lowpaying 
the nations 2 million jobless more than 8 percent are mostly 
skilled workers in depressed fields such as steelmaking 
shipbuilding and coal mining and the generous social welfare system 
discourages them from switching to other trades 
mausch said east germans with experience in electrical work 
engineering and personal services such as hairdressing were in high 
demand in west germany 
workers in all fields are in severe shortage in east germany 
which has encouraged the communist leadership to retain tight 
restrictions on western travel and emigration despite widespread 
public pressure for reform 
many of the schoeppingen refugees who stay here an average of 
three or four days before setting out for resettlement said they 
left illegally because they knew they would never be allowed to 
emigrate 
we are exactly the kind of people the state doesnt want to 
leave observed one woman who did not want her name used smiling 
sardonically she nodded toward the crush of young families and 
added this must really be killing the authorities at home

campbell soup co is phasing out operations 
at its oldest manufacturing plant a sign that the food industry 
giant is moving ahead with aggressive plans to garner a larger share 
of the 2 billion soup market 
a decade ago corporate brass at the nations largest soup maker 
balked at the thought of laying off workers at antiquated plants 
operating at less than capacity 
it took 18 months to close an obsolete facility in chicago 
because company chairman john dorrance jr the son of the inventor 
of condensed soup hated to lay workers off 
ten years ago they acted very paternalistically said marvin 
b roffman an analyst at the philadelphia brokerage firm janney 
montgomery scott inc 
acting on results from a 3year study of campbells operations 
the company announced thursday a worldwide restructuring that will 
include the loss of 2800 jobs and the closure of the 120yearold 
manufacturing plant at its headquarters here and plants in maryland 
and tennessee 
the reorganization approved at a board of directors meeting 
thursday is expected to save the company almost 15 million during 
its fiscal 1990 and about 150 million over the next four years 
said campbell spokeswoman marsha cade 
the restructuring is expected to produce a onetime charge of 
about 344 million or 201 a share against earnings for the 1989 
fiscal year the company said 
production at the camden plant would be moved to other canned 
food plants in napoleon ohio paris texas and maxton nc the 
company said the plant manufactures campbells soups 
francoamerican pasta beans and prego spaghetti sauce 
the plant which opened in the companys first year of existence 
in 1869 will be closed by july 1990 eliminating 940 jobs the 
plant though large is inefficient because of its eightstory 
layout 
also slated for closure are a 272employee plant in pocomoke 
city md a 246worker plant in crisfield md and an 84employee 
plant in smyrna tenn 
five more plants with a total of 1200 workers will be closed at 
a later unspecified date company officials said 
we feel that this will make campbell more efficient ms cade 
said their time has passed them by and they just arent efficient 
as they should be 
many of the employees will be offered transfers and others will 
be offered severance pay or aid in finding other jobs campbell said 
the company said it plans to maintain its headquarters in this 
poor city across the delaware river from philadelphia plans are 
underway to begin construction later this year on a 35 million 
200000squarefoot international headquarters on the citys 
waterfront 
company officials said the 1700 headquarters employees will not 
be affected by the plant closing 
restructuring also is expected at some of the companys foreign 
plants ms cade said campbell has about 100 processing plants 
scattered around the world including about 60 in the united states 
the board already approved capital expenditures of 430 million 
for fiscal 1990 to upgrade plants campbell said 
its really a statement that management is making that were 
going to be lean and mean said roffman any food company who 
wants to be independent in the 90s had better be a very lowcost 
producer with a global presence 
the restructuring comes as little surprise roffman said 
two years ago the company told the world they planned to be 
on top roffman said this is just moving that program into 
superhigh gear 
since 1986 the company has phased out plants in chicago 
pottstown and doylestown pa and memphis mich under the 
program ms cade said 
before his death in april dorrance began to recognize that the 
industry was moving toward consolidated stateoftheart 
operations roffman said 
campbell sells about 5 billion cans of soup a year garnering 
about 65 percent of the 22 billion retail soup market a drop of 
about 5 percent in the past five years the company also has had 
difficulty breaking into the fastergrowing drysoup market

the federal communications commission in what 
may indicate a new gettough policy is contemplating action against 
three radio stations it says may have aired indecent broadcasts 
during the day 
the stations in indianapolis chicago and san jose calif were 
given 30 days to explain their actions or face sanctions ranging 
from a warning to nonrenewal of their licenses fcc general counsel 
diane killory said thursday 
the action comes just two weeks after former missouri broadcaster 
alfred sikes was confirmed as fcc chairman 
sikes and two other new commissioners were questioned closely 
during senate confirmation hearings last month on what they planned 
to do about indecent programming obscene programming is banned 
the agency alleges that wlupam in chicago ksjofm in san jose 
calif and wfbqfm in indianapolis may have violated laws 
prohibiting indecent or obscene programming when children may be in 
the audience 
lawyer john r price president of decency in broadcasting inc 
said the indianapolisbased watchdog group had taped wfbqs bob 
and tom show continuously since july 1987 and submitted more than 
5000 transcripts to the fcc for review 
in the last six months particularly theres been a real 
decline in the quality of material he said thursday it was bad 
before but its really bad now 
price said he hoped the fcc action would be the first step in a 
process that will improve broadcasting in our area 
sen jesse helms rnc an outspoken advocate of banning 
indecent programming 24 hours a day applauded the fcc action 
the american people are fed up with this trash that corrupts 
the minds of our children and erodes the values of our society 
helms said 
however andrew schwartzman executive director of the 
washingtonbased freespeech advocacy group media access project 
criticized the fcc 
im disappointed that chairman sikes top priority seems to be 
suppressing speech rather than promoting it schwartzman said 
the fcc said that based on review of complaints and extensive 
supporting materials received from the public it was considering 
actions against 
evergreen media corp of chicago am licensee of wlupam 
regarding portions of the steve and gary show which airs at 
230 pm 
narragansett broadcasting co of california licensee of 
ksjofm san jose regarding portions of the perry stone show 
which aired at 6 am 
great american tv and radio co licensee of wfbqfm 
indianapolis regarding portions of the bob and tom show which 
airs at 6 am 
on wlups steve and gary show on march 30 1989 and aug 19 
1987 there were alleged discussions of erections descriptions of 
magazine pictures of former miss america vanessa williams and 
another woman and a song about a man filming kiddie porn at a 
youth camp 
stone programs on oct 25 27 28 and 31 and nov 4 1988 
allegedly included a segment in which stone told a female caller he 
wanted to lick food off her body a later segment that featured a 
ribald version of the theme from the beverly hillbillies tv 
show a segment on incest and one on classical music performed in 
fellatio 
on wfbq there allegedly was talk oct 16 1987 and sept 14 
1987 of sex with candy bars and a skit of elvis discussing sex and 
richard nixon 
the latest these broadcasts occurred was at 510 pm killory 
said 
chris wheat general manager of wfbqfm told the indianapolis 
star that the station was fairly confident the fcc will find 
that its rules were followed 
the material doesnt have the innuendo attached to it that one 
might read into the complaint wheat said about the bob and tom 
show complaints once the material is put into context im sure 
we will be cleared of doing anything wrong 
there was no answer to telephone calls to the chicago and san 
jose stations thursday evening 
the fcc based on supreme court rulings in the seven dirty 
words case involving comedian george carlin defines indecency as 
language or material that in context depicts or describes in 
terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community 
standards for the broadcast medium sexual or excretory activities 
or organs such material may not be broadcast when there is a 
reasonable risk that unsupervised children may be in the audience 
the commission has tried to establish a safe harbor for 
indecent programming from midnight to 6 am when children were 
considered unlikely to be listening but a court struck down that 
rule last summer the court said the commission could ban indecent 
speech only during daytime hours 
the fcc in june 1988 fined a kansas city mo station kzkctv 
2000 for broadcasting the movie private lessons at 8 pm the 
movie features explicit nudity in a story about a housekeeper 
seducing a 15yearold boy 
congress last year passed a law extending the ban on indecent 
broadcast material to 24 hours but the us court of appeals in 
washington stayed implementation of the law in january pending an 
appeal by broadcasters and first amendment advocates 
the fcc on thursday also asked the court not to rule on the 
24hour ban challenge before the commission can study the issue 
further killory said

kelly garrett promised he was 
through he was going to sell his last load of ocean sponge and 
leave this gulf coast fishing town where he was lured 18 months ago 
by recordhigh sponge prices 
maybe hed take his wife and child to the bahamas and try to make 
some money salvaging old wrecks 
this is it he said standing amid 700 sponges drying on the 
deck of a weathered fishing boat im getting out while i at least 
have my diving equipment but i can say it was real good there for a 
while 
garrett became the latest defection from the tarpon springs 
sponge fleet as prices have fallen about 80 percent since february 
when a large sponge could bring in 16 and even inexperienced divers 
could easily make 1000 a week 
now its mostly just the few veteran spongers left to wonder 
about the brief boom that clogged the docks with boats and left at 
least four young divers dead from accidental drownings 
some of the oldtime sponge merchants mostly greek immigrants 
and their descendants claim the prices were inflated by japanese 
investors who recently entered the shaky mediterranean sponge market 
others like sponge buyer julio arellano in miami say a 
3yearold blight affecting mediterranean sponge beds was 
responsible for a worldwide shortage 
it was simple supply and demand said the executive of 
arellano brothers inc the main buyer of tarpon springs sponges as 
prices soared there are no good sponges coming out of the 
mediterranean and the value of the tarpon springs sponges went up 
its not more complicated than that 
arellano said prices have dropped to 3 or 4 each due to the 
flood of sponges on the world market from tarpon springs about 30 
miles north of tampa 
although sponges grow in many warmwater areas the best species 
come either from the eastern mediterranean or the gulf waters off 
tarpon springs where the nutrients and rock beds are ideal for 
large and hardy sponges said john stevely a sponge expert 
affiliated with the university of florida 
the mediterranean blight suspected to be caused by a bacteria 
makes the sponges small and brittle a similar disease in the gulf 
of mexico and the caribbean in the 1940s nearly wiped out the sponge 
industry in florida and cuba which is now a sponge supplier to east 
bloc nations 
a sponge is acually the remains of a marine animal that lives in 
the pores sun drying kills the living part of the natural sponge 
now mostly sold in the united staates as a novelty bath item or as a 
nonscratching alternative to synethetic sponges but the demand for 
natural sponge is still high in europe and elsewhere 
george billiris who began sponge diving in 1939 believes 
japanese sponge interests purchased the highpriced sponges earlier 
this year in an attempt to corner the market and drive out smaller 
competitors 
look if a sponge cost 15 each it would cost the consumer 45 
for a sponge that didnt happen i think they were just trying to 
protect their investments in the mediterranean said billiris 
but james cantonis president of acme sponge and chamois co in 
tarpon springs said it was mostly a panic among european buyers as 
inventories of preblight mediterranean sponges fell 
he also noted that european sponge buyers who usually make 
purchases by the kilogram were unfamiliar with the denser tarpons 
springs wool sponges 
acually the perkilo price was not that crazy said 
cantonis also president of the new yorkbased sponge and chamois 
institute but they were surprised by the wool sponges you got 
only about half as many per kilo 
at one point our sponges were selling at 350 an ounce 
silver now sells about 5 an ounce this is not gold or silver we 
are taking about 
cantonis said there are no records of natural sponge sales in the 
united states or worldwide 
although experts are not sure how long the mediterranean blight 
may last acme has built a new sponge processing plant to meet 
european demand 
this portends well for tarpon springs he said what the 
prices will do i cannot say 
when the boom began sponge diver cary barger said he predicted 
prices would fall he also was correct about his other preminition 
that untrained divers would die 
in february more than 200 people were diving for sponges now 
theres less than two dozen the us coast guard investigated the 
deaths of at least four divers 
some of the victims were working alone and had problems with the 
air compressors or tangled air hoses divers can spend up to nine 
hours under 30 to 40 feet of water 
this is serious business and people just thought you jump down 
there and pick up sponges like you pick up money said barger who 
started diving two years ago it was insane 
everyone is looking for the next oil boom said cantonis 
everyone is looking to become a millionaire overnight well i can 
tell you this is not the business they should be looking at

when engineering graduate david kimbrell 
looked around in the mid1980s and wondered how to make a living he 
found the answer buried in the walls 
along with colleague frank hall kimbrell founded one of the 
first consulting firms that advise the best way to test for and 
dispose of asbestos the widely used building insulation that has 
been found to cause cancer 
then kimbrell had a hunch about schools 
by the time congress approved a 1986 law requiring control and 
cleanup of asbestos in school buildings kimbrell already had a 
national marketing campaign ready 
hallkimbrells growth exploded its revenues tripling over the 
past three years from contracts with 15 percent of the nations 
school districts 
i dont know if its a sixth sense or what but we kind of feel 
things coming said kimbrell 38 we try to watch for the 
regulatory trends whats the research on what is toxic what are 
the liability issues and we felt that asbestos was going to be a 
major problem 
now kimbrell is betting on his sixth sense again 
we started watching japan two or three years ago he said 
and we speculated that they were just at that stage of 
industrialization where theyre starting to address the issues of 
asbestos and employee occupational exposure so far weve been 
right 
kimbrell bought out halls interest in the firm after the first 
few months of business although hes retained the hallkimbrell 
corporate name 
his hunches have propelled hallkimbrells growth since he and 
his wife drew up a fiveyear plan in 1983 for the company theyd 
started in mississippi the year before theyd already made 120000 
from asbestos consulting and were trying to decide what to do 
we wanted to be the best environmental engineering firm in the 
nation he said we decided to take the specialty we knew 
asbestos and form a national company on that so we drew up a plan 
to take literally every penny we made and put it back into growth 
the plague of lingering asbestos resurfaced this past week when 
federal prosecutors filed civil suits against several defendants 
nationwide alleging improper handling of the material during 
renovation and removal projects the lawsuits underscored the 
importance of the kind of services that hallkimbrell and other 
asbestoscleansing consultants provide 
hallkimbrell has surveyed more than 1300 school districts for 
asbestos in addition to 15 state governments 200 colleges ten 
airports and thousands of commercial clients typically its 
engineers develop a plan to remove or contain asbestos then monitor 
another company that actually does the work 
its revenues grew from 248000 in 1983 to 45 million last year 
and a 34th place on inc magazines list of the fastestgrowing us 
companies 
the firm now employs about 800 people in 26 offices 
hallkimbrell moved to lawrence near kansas city to be in the 
central part of the country and near a regional environmental 
protection agency office but much of its work remains on the east 
coast 
according to plan hallkimbrell also began diversifying in the 
late 1980s advising companies on environmental problems ranging 
from hazardous wastes and groundwater contamination 
next year it expects to start a hotline in connection with 
grocery store chains to let customers know how much pesticide is in 
the produce they buy 
the fast growth hasnt been problem free the company laid off 39 
workers earlier this summer in a move to cut costs 
earlier this year kimbrell had considered a 725 million buyout 
offer from law companies group an atlanta environmental firm but 
kimbrell said he rejected the deal because of differences with law 
companies over control 
nonetheless many analysts think such deals are the industrys 
future 
fastgrowing small to mediumsized companies such as 
hallkimbrell have dominated the asbestoscontrol business up to 
now but bigger environmental services companies are want a piece of 
the market now estimated between 1 billion and 3 billion a year 
said steven bernard a securities analyst with edward d jones amp co 
in st louis 
analysts foresee most of the industrys growth in the united 
states as more states approve even stricter asbestos guidelines for 
private buildings 
but that hasnt stopped hallkimbrell from pressing ahead with 
its overseas plans most of its business overseas currently involves 
advising japanese firms that own us property said john carlin a 
former kansas governor who sits on hallkimbrells board of 
directors and has helped it get started in japan 
given the context of how long it takes to set up business 
there theyre doing extremely well carlin said

texas air corp says it is considering selling a 
minority or controlling stake in its continental airlines subsidiary 
and has talked to parties interested in the airline 
texas air the nations largest airline company also said 
thursday it has hired an investment adviser to explore a possible 
transaction 
the announcement came a week after a boston investment firm 
disclosed that it holds 12 percent of texas air which also owns 
strikeplagued eastern airlines loomis sayles amp co a boston 
portfolio management company has said its 12 percent stake was held 
for investment because it believed texas air would show a profit in 
1990 
scandinavian airlines system owns around 10 percent of texas air 
late thursday texas air released a statement saying its 
chairman frank lorenzo revealed that the company was considering a 
possible sale of an interest in continental during a management 
conference 
lorenzo said in a statement there were arguments in favor of 
selling continental such as giving the airline access to stronger 
financial resources 
however he said there are also a number of compelling reasons 
why a sale of the company may not be advisable 
continental is emerging from a period of consolidations with 
other airlines as a stronger company and shows potential for 
improved financial results lorenzo said 
texas air said it retained the investment firm drexel burnham 
lambert inc as an adviser on any transaction continental spokesman 
ned walker declined to comment further on the statement 
miamibased eastern is in the midst of chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization the carrier filed for protection from its creditors 
on march 9 five days after its machinists pilots and flight 
attendants went on strike since then it has been rebuilding as a 
smaller airline using nonunion workers 
in 1983 lorenzo followed a similar path with continental 
airline industry analysts expressed surprise at lorenzos 
announcement 
i expected continental would be the last thing he would dispose 
of said louis marckesano of janney montgomery scott inc in 
philadelphia 
continental would carry a sale price of about 2 billion if it 
were sold in its entirety and lorenzo may just be trying to find 
out what continental is worth he suggested 
he might just be testing the waters marckesano said 
many observers had expected lorenzo to fold the remnants of 
eastern into continental he noted 
the worst may be over and it surprises me he would be 
considering a major sale said daniel hersh an analyst with 
bateman eichler hill richards in los angeles 
he speculated that lorenzo might be considering bringing in a 
highprofile purchaser to change continentals image as a lowfare 
carrier that does not appeal to business travelers 
i think the biggest problem is the image of continental with 
the business travelers hersh said

pilots from major competitors are volunteering to 
stage a wildcat work stoppage sept 4 to support eastern airlines 
strikers a union official said thursday 
its called shut down america said hank weber a spokesman 
for the eastern local of the air line pilots association its one 
of those things weve never had anything from the grassroots like 
this before all we can do is watch and see what happens 
weber said the union wasnt organizing the effort and had no 
details but has been flooded with messages of support he showed 
messages from pilots for such airlines as united northwest twa and 
aloha airlines 
one message called for sos suspension of service sickout 
in september are you sick of whats happening to our eastern 
brothers 
alpas executive council representing pilots at most of the 
nations major airlines last week took no action on a request by 
easterns pilots for a national work stoppage to show solidarity 
with the strike that will be six months old on sept 4 
however weber said that while unions can be fined or face other 
sanctions for encouraging wildcat strikes an unofficial sickout may 
be forming as an alternative sept 4 is labor day a heavy travel 
day 
weber said members of other unions including some outside the 
airline industry also have offered to participate 
easterns union leadership met in washington on thursday to plan 
strategy while some leaders two weeks ago discussed ending the 
strike their rankandfile members have voted in local meetings to 
continue 
the pilots who joined easterns machinists and flight attendants 
in a march 4 walkout said they want action to dramatize that their 
strike is continuing and that eastern is rebuilding with 
inexperienced newly hired pilots who are jeopardizing safety 
eastern spokesman robin matell said the company wouldnt comment 
on the reported work stoppage effort 
texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo whose reputed 
unionbusting has been the focus of the strike announced late 
thursday that he is considering selling a minority or controlling 
stake in easterns sister carrier continental airlines 
in atlanta meanwhile the local chief of the eastern pilots 
union said thursday he will resign in a disagreement over continuing 
the strike 
james b holder the head of the atlanta local of easterns 
pilots union said the 300 pilots who attended a wednesday meeting 
voted to continue the strike 
he said he objected to the decision because by continuing to 
strike eastern could hire enough replacement pilots and we could 
be gone

when the first 4minute mile was run it generated 
enthusiastic forecasts of a 3minute 50second mile to come when a 
highjumper achieved 8 feet sports enthusiasts said man could go 
higher 
same thing in stocks records create excitement and enthusiasm 
for more when the dow jones industrial average reached a new high 
last week you could hear the roar of the boosters seeking even 
greater heights 
it might work it might not 
excitement and enthusiasm have been ingredients of stock markets 
for all time and to some unmeasured degree they have an impact but 
when the cheering stops its the pace of the economy and profits 
that dictate prices 
the consensus forecast is for the economy to grow slowly just 
skirting recession the corporate profits outlook is for a loss of 
momentum a decline in the rate of growth it is happening already 
conceivably the stock market could see something the 
economists dont it wouldnt be the first time it has foreseen 
better or worse times than the consensus forecast it could happen 
again 
whatever the scaffolding for stock prices is stronger now than 
it was before the october 1987 crash when enthusiasm alone seemed 
to carry the market for several hundred points 
whether or not it is sufficiently strong is debatable 
wright investors service which relies on numerical rather than 
oratorical evidence of support advises a look at the profits 
picture specifically the slowing of the rate at which profits are 
rising 
with reports in from 90 percent of the companies making up the 
standard amp poors 500stock index secondquarter earnings are 
estimated to have risen only 5 percent from the same period a year 
ago thats hardly bullish 
that secondquarter performance appears even weaker when compared 
with the first quarters yearoveryear increase of 22 percent and 
with a 36 percent increase for the entire year 1988 vs 1987 
as measured by perhaps the most popular index of all the dow 
jones average of 30 industrial stocks the indications of support 
are no stronger compared with a year earlier secondquarter 
earnings of the 30 companies were down 5 percent 
many things move stock markets and percentages such as these are 
only one of them but theres one thing you can say about declines 
in profits or declines in the rate at which they are rising they 
cannot be ignored 
eventually stock prices and earnings must reconcile their 
differences they cannot go separate ways for long any more than 
the human heart and lungs can operate at their own individual tempos 
perhaps a better indication of the future might evolve from a 
government report due to be released this week the commerce 
departments estimate of real corporate profits 
wright believes the 7year bull market has had a sound basis for 
much of its life since operating profits excluding profits from 
priceinflated inventories and adjusted for depreciation did rise 
sustantially 
but it adds over the past three years operating profits havent 
been as impressive as they were earlier in the expansion in fact 
it says theyve been unimpressive and becoming more so 
it expects this weeks commerce department report to show signs 
of further profit deterioration

avis europe plc a british vehicle rental and 
leasing company announced friday it has received a friendly offer 
that could lead to its eventual reunification with avis inc the 
international company 
it said the bidder cilva holdings plc valued avis europe at 
8965 million pounds the equivalent of 14 billion or 600 pence a 
share 
avis europe shares soared 32 pence to 592 pence on the london 
stock exchange by midmorning 
cilva is 647percentowned by lease international sa a 
luxembourgbased holding company which already owns 336 percent of 
aviss existing shares avis inc owns 88 percent of cilva and 
general motors capital corp has the rest 
cilva is said to have has assurances of an additional 264 
percent of avis europes share capital leaving 40 percent of avis 
europes shares outstanding avis europes board except for three 
individuals has recommended that its shareholders take up the cilva 
offer 
three years ago avis inc owned avis europe but was taken over 
in a leveraged buyout by westray capital corp a us consortium 
which then floated 66 percent of avis europe on the london stock 
exchange relations between the two avis groups remained friendly 
wesray sold avis inc to the rental companys employees in 1987 
lease international consisting of two belgian investors was 
formed solely to hold avis europes shares and said upon completing 
the offer an appropriate environment would exist for reuniting avis 
europe and avis inc 
this it said would enhance the growth prospects of both 
companies 
avis europe avis inc and lease international said they see 
strong commercial reasons for uniting the two avis units which 
will be easier and more highly leveraged under a private company 
structure 
the announcement was seen as underlining avis incs desire for a 
foothold in europe before 1992 when the 12 nations of the european 
economic community are to drop their trade barriers 
in the financial year ended february avis europe reported a 31 
percent rise in pretax profits to 72 million pounds

the world is tightening its economic 
boycott of south africa but the apartheid state exploits loopholes 
such as foreign registration mislabeling and thirdparty shipping 
to carry on trade says a new report 
among the most vociferous proponents of sanctions are the black 
frontline states of southern africa which ironically carry on 
considerable trade with south africa and are tied to it by railroads 
and power lines these nations do not ban bilateral trade with south 
africa 
the report issued this week from the united nations center on 
transnational corporations notes that in recent years the frontline 
states have become transshipment points for south african goods 
among other south african tactics cited in the report are these 
mislabeling export goods such as textiles sent to america 
apples to europe and wines to canada 
illegal transfer of ownership on oil shipments to skirt the ban 
on such shipments from oilproducing states 
transshipment of goods through other states south africas 
textile industry for example makes extensive use of foreign 
factories to complete the manufacture of fabrics and assemble 
garments 
sending south african coal to european ports that do not ban it 
primarily rotterdam and anterp where it is mixed with other 
nations coal to produce dutch blend or simply relabeled as 
dutch and transshipped 
turning to the booming far eastern nations for increased trade 
as north american and european nations have tightened their 
sanctions 
still most governments have responded to appeals by the general 
assembly for a voluntary sanctions on south africa the report notes 
as a result broad geographical and economic areas and sectors 
have been left outside the reach of south africa or avoidance 
practices in these areas have imposed additional costs on its 
economy the report says 
the center notes that markets for south african products have 
declined in size indicating that efforts to evade sanctions have 
been only partially successful 
the report did not set an exact figure on the cost of sanctions 
to south africa but noted the countrys economy has been weak 
through the 1980s with a growth rate below 15 percent a year 
official unemployment rates among south african blacks is at 
least 15 percent and unofficial estimates are much higher in 
addition the country has a foreign debt of 22 billion 
threefourths of it owed to transnational banks 
the general assembly has been urging nations and companies to 
shun south africa since 1962 
the security council imposed a mandatory ban on arms trade with 
south africa in 1977 that spurred the country to develop its own 
arms industry which has turned into a profitable export business 
in 1985 the security council endorsed a voluntary embargo on new 
investments export loan guarantees the sale of krugerrand gold 
coins nuclear contracts and computer equipment 
however britain and the united states have always vetoed 
resolutions that call for mandatory sanctions saying that would 
hurt the black population

grain and soybean futures closed lower friday in 
quiet trading on the chicago board of trade 
the selloff was attributed to the forecasts for rain in the 
plains states and the ohio valley over the weekend and expectation 
of more precipitation next week said dale gustafson an analyst 
with drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago 
as a result of the rain traders are expecting improved corn and 
soybean crop conditions next week gustafson said 
slack export sales and a drop in processor demand were also cited 
as a cause of the selloff in soybeans and corn 
there is not much working in terms of export sales which is a 
problem for the market gustafson said 
the selloff in the corn and soybean pits spilled over into wheat 
futures where the lack of new export sales also hurt prices 
at the close wheat was 3 cents to 6 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 390 a bushel corn was 1 
cents to 1 cents lower with september at 233 a bushel oats were 
1 cent to 3 cents lower with september at 134 a bushel soybeans 
were a cent to 14 cents lower with september at 581 a bushel

anniversary the markets most famous barometer soared 5653 points

stock prices are far lower in relation to underlying company profits 
than they were two years ago said lawrence kudlow chief economist 
at bear stearns amp co 
fundamentally this is a great expression of confidence in the 
whole us economic outlook kudlow said we keep throwing 
negatives at the market and they dont stick 
added david m jones chief economist at the brokerage firm 
aubrey g lanston amp co essentially the stock market is telling 
us that a soft landing is in store for the economy and thats 
exactly the slowdown you need to keep inflation from accelerating 
while some other strategists are more skeptical about the 
economys health a market rally can sometimes feed on itself 
regardless of fundamental factors 
the worst thing that can happen to an institutional money 
manager is to sit there with a pile of cash and watch the market 
take off without him its a buying panic said lawrence r 
helfand managing director for retail sales at the chicago brokerage 
rodman amp renshaw inc 
thursdays gain was the secondbiggest of the year and it came 
in the heaviest trading since midjune a good sign for the market 
volume on the new york stock exchange totaled 22552 million shares 
a subdued cheer rose from the exchange floor after the close 
thursday 
a day like every other day no big deal said peter mancuso 
a specialist with albert fried amp co there was no question in 
everybodys mind that the market would get back to these levels it 
just needed some time 
there was no economic news thursday to account for the big jump 
bonds were up slightly and the dollar edged higher 
the markets going up just on its own when you call around 
theres no reason it just went up brusca said 
from its low point at the close of black monday to its close 
thursday the dow jones industrial average rose 57 percent 
while nobodys paid much attention to it its two of the 
strongest years back to back that weve had helfand said

a hearing has been scheduled next month 
to determine whether former ohio financier marvin warner will be 
allowed to reorganize his financial affairs to stave off liquidation 
us bankruptcy judge george proctor scheduled a hearing sept 7 
on whether warners case should be converted back to a chapter 11 
reorganization instead of the chapter 7 liquidation decreed by the 
court july 28 
we hope at this hearing to present the true perspective of this 
case and unmask the nature of the claimants warner said following 
a hearing friday 
in his motion before the court the former us ambassador to 
switzerland who is appealing a securities conviction in ohio 
claimed he was not given proper advance notification of plans to 
convert the case to chapter 7 which allows the appointment of a 
trustee and liquidation of a debtors assets 
warner target of a flood of lawsuits following the collapse of 
his cincinnatibased home state savings bank in march 1985 said he 
filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in 
october 1987 in an attempt to consolidate the legal actions 
i came to chapter 11 not because i owed people money i wanted 
to consolidate in one forum these many lawsuits warner said 
friday 
he contends a list of creditors including the state of ohio 
seeking 45 billion are merely claimants 
i dont owe anybody anything warner said the attorney 
general of ohio has stated that the losses in the closing of home 
state have substantially been recovered how can the state of 
ohio justify having a claim of 275 million 
in march 1987 the creditors obtained a federal court order that 
warner pay back to ohio 22 million needed to guarantee home state 
deposits 
warner 70 was convicted on ohio felony charges in home states 
collapse but was acquitted of federal charges in a separate trial 
he is appealing the state conviction and a 22 million restitution 
order 
home state collapsed four days after esm government securities in 
fort lauderdale was shut down by federal regulators for insolvency 
home state had invested heavily with esm through securities trade 
and lost 144 million when esm was closed 
several months after the home state collapse warner and his wife 
jody moved from suburban cincinnati to a 153acre farm near ocala 
where warner breeds throughbred horses 
warner contends that more than 80 percent of his 1986 income was 
derived from farming and farmers estates cant be converted to 
chapter 7 without the debtors consent 
warner also claims 18 million of his estate is exempt from 
bankruptcy under floridas homestead law which allows people to 
protect their homes from bankruptcy proceedings the law protects up 
to onehalf acre in urban areas and 160 acres in rural areas 
meanwhile warners creditors and attorneys have been meeting in 
an attempt to settle his bankruptcy case but so far have not 
reached any agreement 
at a hearing thursday west palm beach attorney daniel bakst was 
replaced as trustee of warners estate by tallahassee attorney 
ronald mowrey

stock prices pulled back a bit today hesitating 
after the yearlong rally that carried the market to record highs on 
thursday 
the market appeared to pause as some traders cashed in the 
dramatic gains of stock prices lately 
but prices generally held steady on the strength of the 
enthusiasm generated by thursdays record high and the widespread 
public attention it received 
analysts say the market has been able to recoup the last of the 
losses it suffered in the crash of 1987 with help from increasing 
confidence that the federal reserve can restrain inflation without 
causing a recession 
they also note that corporate earnings have risen sharply in the 
past two years making the perceived risk in stocks less than it was 
when the market peaked out two years ago today

month after the investigation at the board of trade and the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
the three who pleaded guilty friday were freed on bond and have 
agreed to cooperate with the government in the remaining cases they 
most likely will testify against codefendants at upcoming trials

david skrodski 32 a soybean broker admitted that he defrauded 
customers by making prearranged trades in 1987 that he profited from 
with others charged in the alleged scheme he could be sentenced to 
a maximum of six years in prison and fined up to 350000 
craig lacrosse a 40yearold father of four admitted that he 
accepted an illegal prearranged trade from an undercover fbi agent

innocent pleas friday were scott anixter 40 bradley ashman 28

federal reserve policymakers voted to nudge 
interest rates lower in july but they worried about reigniting 
inflation by going too far according to minutes of the meeting 
released friday 
the federal open market committee noting fairly consistent 
weakness in housing and consumer spending voted 101 at the end of 
its july 56 meeting to lower shortterm interest rates 
subsequently the benchmark federal funds rate the rate banks 
charge each other for overnight loans fell twice in quarterpoint 
increments to 9 percent 
it was the third crediteasing move by the central bank since 
early june after the federal funds rate hit a peak of more than 975 
percent the first loosening move had ended a yearlong program that 
increased the rate by three percentage points in an effort to 
squelch inflationary pressures 
however since last month the fed has held interest rates steady 
and the minutes indicate many members believed additional easing 
would be unwise in the absence of further indications of lagging 
economic growth 
many emphasized that current economic and financial 
uncertainties called for caution in adjusting policy at this 
point the minutes said in this view more than a slight move 
to less restraint could have an undesireable effect on inflationary 
expectations 
in the view of some members there remained some risk that 
inflationary pressures would intensify and that the easing might 
have to be reversed later the minutes said 
martha seger was the only committee member to dissent and h 
robert heller who earlier had announced his intention to resign 
from the fed was absent 
the minutes indicate seger believed the economy had slowed 
substantially and likely would weaken further next year unless 
the central bank pushed rates down more sharply than the majority 
decided 
the open market committee is composed of the seven federal 
reserve board governors and five of the 12 presidents of regional 
federal reserve banks it meets privately about eight times a year 
it aims to provide enough growth in the money supply to keep the 
economy out of a recession but also to avoid overheated growth that 
could accelerate inflation 
the committee issues directives that govern the open market desk 
of the federal reserve bank of new york through purchases or sales 
of government securities the fed influences the amount of money 
banks have available to make loans and thus the price of those 
loans interest rates 
the july directive to the new york bank in fed parlance was 
neutral the members decided that after the rate decline in 
july some firming or some easing would be acceptable 
depending on indications of inflationary pressures and the 
strength of the business expansion 
the open market committee met again on tuesday but minutes from 
that gathering wont be made public until three days after the next 
meeting on oct 3 
inflation has cooled recently but most analysts pointing to 
signs the economy may be rebounding from sluggishness in the first 
half believe the committee decided at its latest meeting to 
continue an evenhanded policy 
the unemployment rate dipped to 52 percent in july and retail 
sales rose 09 percent consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 
67 percent from january through may but fell to a little less than 
half of that in june and july as gasoline and food prices eased 
the july meeting also sets monetary targets for the rest of the 
year and preliminary targets for the following year the committee 
voted unanimously for a growth target this year of 3 percent to 7 
percent for a broad measure of the money supply that includes cash 
checking and savings accounts and money market mutual funds 
however the committee split 101 in recommending that the same 
target be maintained in 1990 breaking with the recent practice of 
reducing the target annually 
silas keehn president of the federal reserve bank of chicago 
dissented the minutes said because he believed a reduction of 
the ranges for the next year would provide an important signal of 
the feds continuing commitment to price stability

wheat production is up from last years 
droughtshriveled harvest but not enough to forestall another drain 
on us grain reserves and an upward creep in prices the 
agriculture department said thursday 
the analysis by the departments economic research service was 
based on the aug 10 estimate that wheat production would be about 
204 billion bushels up 13 percent from the 1988 harvest 
wheat use including exports is expected to be 229 billion 
bushels in the marketing year that began on june 1 down 5 percent 
from 198889 
with us farm prices expected near the target price 4 per 
bushel in 198990 and increased competitor supplies exports may 
decline more than 10 percent to less than 13 billion bushels the 
report said the us share of world trade is expected to slip as 
well 
at the end of the 198889 wheat marketing year the united states 
had about 694 million bushels from previous harvests in its 
stockpile and this june 1 carryover was down from more than 
126 billion bushels a year earlier 
by next june 1 the report said the wheat stockpile will be 
trimmed further to an estimated 474 million bushels down more than 
30 percent and the smallest carryover since 197475 
most of the reduction will occur in the inventories held by the 
departments commodity credit corp as forfeited collateral for 
pricesupport loans made to producers other reductions will be in 
the farmerowned reserve of wheat stored under loan and released 
to the market as prices rise and the loans become due 
area planted increased 17 percent in response to attractive 
prices and less acreage idled under annual government programs but 
yields are forecast to be the lowest since 1978 because of 
lingering drought in major wheat production areas the report said 
because of the continued tight wheat supply the government has 
lowered the landidling requirement for 1990 to 5 percent of the 
base acreage down from 10 percent for 1989 and 275 percent in 
1988 that is land farmers must take from production in order to 
qualify for federal supports 
wheat prices are projected to average in the range of 385 to 
425 per bushel in the 198990 marketing year up from 372 
estimated for 198889

texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo said 
friday he was considering a sale of continental airlines because the 
noise at striketorn eastern airlines was hurting the sister 
carriers business 
in an interview with the associated press lorenzo said the sale 
of part or all of houstonbased continental was under discussion 
partly because of the negative impact from easterns bitter strike 
and bankruptcy proceeding 
we have to be responsible to our shareholders lorenzo said 
in his new york office we have an obligation to look for 
alternatives continental has been impacted by the noise level 
from all of our friends over in miami 
he made the surprise announcement about continental late thursday 
in response to a question at a company meeting 
miamibased eastern has been under chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection since march 9 five days after pilots machinists and 
flight attendants walked off the job eastern has been reorganizing 
as a smaller carrier and has hired nonunion workers 
the spillover from the eastern situation has eroded bookings on 
continental flights and cut into its profits in the second quarter 
said lorenzo whose texas air is the parent of the two carriers 
continental showed a net profit of 321 million in the quarter 
compared with a loss of 1509 million a year earlier 
continental could benefit from distance from eastern lorenzo 
said he cited the success of the trump shuttle which enjoyed a 
sharp rise in passenger traffic as soon as developer donald trump 
bought it from eastern in early june for 365 million 
lorenzo stressed however a full or partial sale of continental 
are merely being considered as possible options and a final decision 
hasnt yet been made 
we have been approached by parties interested in a possible 
sale he said 
despite the strife at eastern and continentals reputation as a 
farecutting carrier with inferior service texas air stock has 
soared from around 9 or 10 a share at the beginning of the year to 
over 20 currently it rose 87 cents friday to close at 2075 on 
the american stock exchange after jumping as high as 2225 
possible buyers of continental or part of it could include 
scandinavian airlines system which has a 10 percent interest in 
texas air and pan am corp which has expressed a desire to merge 
with another airline under us law foreign airlines are allowed 
to buy up to 25 percent of american carriers there also has been 
speculation that carl icahn the owner and chairman of trans world 
airlines inc may be interested in a combination with continental 
lorenzo however appears to have rejected the idea of a merger 
with another airline according to a source close to the company who 
asked not to be named that would make more likely a buyout from an 
investor group possibly including sas or another foreign carrier 
sas spokeswoman barbara levites and pan am spokeswoman pamela 
hanlon both in new york declined comment on the matter friday an 
icahn associate didnt immediately return a call seeking comment 
continental would carry a sale price of about 2 billion if it 
were sold in its entirety and lorenzo may be trying to find out 
what the carrier could fetch some analysts suggested 
the worst may be over and it surprises me he lorenzo would be 
considering a major sale said daniel hersh an analyst with 
bateman eichler hill richards in los angeles 
lorenzo may be seeking to capitalize on the takeover frenzy 
sweeping the airline industry which could make struggling 
continental a hot property 
a group led by california investor alfred checchi recently 
acquired northwest airlines parent nwa inc for 4 billion while 
united airlines parent ual corp is being ardently pursued by 
investor marvin davis british airways plc and others

cocoa exchange as traders looked ahead to next months meeting of 
the international cocoa organization with an expectation of failure 
on other markets copper prices reached new contract highs grain 
and soybean futures plunged precious metals declined oil futures 
were down and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
cocoa settled 37 to 47 lower with the contract for delivery in 
september at 1066 a metric ton 
the selloff in cocoa futures followed icos revision of its 
forecast for the 19881989 world cocoa surplus raising the figure

the market is looking forward to the international cocoa 
organization meeting in london next month stevenson said 
perhaps the organization can come up with new price support 
measures but the principal players in the market are looking at 
it as a likely failure 
the ico meeting of cocoa producers and consumers is to take place 
sept 11 
cocoa prices have been depressed in recent years by five 
consecutive years of surplus crops the surplus has hurt the 
economies of major cocoaproducing nations such as the ivory coast 
copper futures hit new contract highs on new yorks commodity 
exchange as production problems around the world continue to push up 
prices 
copper was up by 470 cents to 680 cents with the august 
contract at 1373 a pound 
in addition to a paralyzing strike in peru copper production is 
hampered by a strike at the highland valley mines in british 
columbia canada the bankruptcy of mexicos cananea mine which is 
expected to be closed for up to three months and the shutdown of 
the bougainville mines in papua new guinea due to terrorist 
activities by landowners

close of business on aug 31 
the financing plan is entirely consistent with our goals for 
ual it allows for the continued implementation of uals growth and
