historian lajos fuer to run for president in multiparty elections

the us armys school of the americas is 
teaching officers from latin america how to fight the narcotics 
trade 
the students are concerned about narcotics said col 
william a depalo jr commandant of the school at fort benning 
they recognize it as not only a threat to the united states but 
its now become apparent to them through an increased number of 
drug addicts in their own countries 
the school relocated from the panama canal zone in 1984 under 
the terms of the uspanama canal treaties trains military 
personnel from 18 latin american nations said depalo 
six new courses are aimed at violent drug traffickers depalo 
said subjects include use of ranger units strategic intelligence 
and disarming booby traps 
the classes range in length from a month to a year the school 
has no structured semestertype system and individual officers set 
up their own schedules 
depalo who is fluent in spanish visits a latin american 
country each month to meet with military leaders to promote the 
school and to make sure its courses are relevant 
as far as winning the battle against drug trafficking the key 
will be in getting the countries to limit and supress the supply 
he said 
they say we need to do more on our end in controlling 
consumption and theyre right depalo said this thing has to 
be attacked consistently and unrelentingly but at least the 
american public has awakened to the fact it appears that this is 
a serious national security threat more serious than the soviet 
union at this point 
the school of the americas founded in panama in 1947 has 
trained more than 50000 officers and enlisted military personnel 
from latin america it moved to the united states in 1984 after 
this country and panama were unable to reach an agreement that 
would have kept it operating in panama

five soviet engineers came to study 
building design nine mexicans flew in to check disaster 
preparedness japan wanted precise detail on how much the earth 
moved new york city police looked at emergency response 
for all its havoc last weeks earthquake is now an 
international case study for experts focusing on how and why the 
earth convulses what structures survive its tremors and how to 
save shaken lives 
if theres any comfort for the people who lost loved ones it 
may be that all professionals learn from each one of these 
disasters it means we can do better the next time said ian 
buckle deputy director of the national center for earthquake 
engineering research in buffalo ny 
in a sense it is a laboratory teams from around the world 
will come to learn from this he said 
buckle was appointed by gov george deukmejian to investigate 
the collapse of the elevated twotiered section of interstate 880 
in oakland where people and vehicles were smashed between slabs of 
concrete and steel 
the freeway was built in 1957 before design load requirements 
were tightened because of lessons learned in the 1971 san fernando 
earthquake buckle said existing roads and bridges were supposed 
to be upgraded to conform to new codes 
new bridges were not just designed for strength but ductility 
the ability to be pliable without collapsing they well knew they 
had not brought that highway up to code maybe this will accelerate 
that program buckle said 
i880 was scheduled for improvements but the state had deferred 
the work was because officials thought the highway was structurally 
sound 
in their labs engineers tinker with theories on computers on 
how to make things strong enough to withstand jolts now they can 
correlate their computer models against what happened in heavily 
populated northern california just as they learned lessons from 
quakes in armenia mexico city and tokyo 
we cant simulate these forces in a lab the forces are so 
large buckle said we dont get very many opportunities to 
test theories or new design roles 
not all lessons are technical police and fire departments from 
new york city to phoenix ariz sent monitors to observe the 
search and rescue work at i880 where a burly dockworker was 
plucked from the crumbled concrete four days after the tuesday 
temblor 
in this business we all try to learn from each others 
disasters what were the pitfalls and what goes well said 
oakland police sgt alan whitman 
on friday five soviet engineers walked through san franciscos 
marina district an upscale neighborhood where as many as 60 
buildings crumbled or were damaged beyond repair 
the moscow experts sought to learn lessons they can use in the 
rebuilding of armenia which was rocked earlier this year by an 
earthquake of similar magnitude the death toll there was 25000 
blamed partly on shoddy construction of brick and mortar homes 
your city is much better than ours was because we had prepared 
only for a 60 richter scale earthquake said nathan kotylar 
through an interpretor both quakes registered 69 
a ninemember delegation from mexico came to learn about getting 
ready for an earthquake because that country was underprepared for 
the 1985 earthquake that ravaged mexico city 
they did not have a national system of disaster preparedness 
or a civil emergency agency said paul flores director of the 
southern california earthquake preparedness project 
he said his office had also been contacted by several states 
hoping to learn from californias experience and he expected 
delegations from japan new zealand and australia when things 
settle down 
this was a tragedy but it would be even more of a tragedy if 
we didnt learn what we could flores said 
the greatest number of earthquake sleuths concentrated on the 
epicenter on loma prieta mountain in the forest of nisene marks 
state park 10 miles from santa cruz 
two plates of earth slipped 11 miles underground with enough 
fury to move mountains flatten freeways buckle bridges crumple 
buildings and interrupt baseballs premier event the world series 
geologists and seismologists swarmed the mountain searching for 
cracks on the surface that would show where the san andreas fault 
ruptured baffled scientists have been unable to locate the main 
fissure 
we should see surface displacement of as much as 3 to 4 
feet said robert streitz a geologist with the california 
division of mines and geology 
its a jigsaw puzzle with 10000 pieces said geologist 
david schwartz 
the quake triggered 90 instruments around the area that had been 
preset to measure the speed of movement in buildings structures 
and the ground 
a comprehensive analysis of those readings will take up to a 
year although japanese experts have already asked california 
officials for them via fax machines 
experts will also focus on schools and hospitals to see how they 
survived undamaged structures will be studied for design features 
that helped them get through

volunteer lines were long and stacks of 
information huge but the victims were few sunday at this citys 
only fema disaster center and the visits did not change the lives 
of those who did show up 
the federal emergency management agency opened seven onestop 
disaster relief centers sunday one each for the counties affected 
by last weeks earthquake 
volunteers helped people fill out applications for lowinterest 
loans individual and family grants temporary housing counseling 
tax information legal service referrals social security 
veterans benefits or hiring a contractor 
the centers opened at 1 pm by 335 pm 126 people had 
registered at this center set up in a gymnasium at the presidio 
army base just blocks from the marina district one of the areas 
hardest hit by the 69magnitude quake that struck at 504 pm 
tuesday 
by the end of the day 565 applications for assistance had been 
submitted to fema at all seven disaster centers said fema 
spokesman phil cogan in addition 6241 applications had been 
accepted over a special telephone hotline 
federal officials expressed disappointment at the presidio 
turnout typically we have the longest lines on the first day 
said mike allan a fema spokesman 
only 35 or 40 people were in line when the center opened he 
said 
at the entrance to the gym temporary fema employees waited to 
help but they outnumbered victims all afternoon 
barbara nash and jody rosendin both red cross volunteers were 
concerned about the low turnout 
its been a lot slower than we thought ms nash said 
most of the people want money right now and we cant give them 
money but doctors psychologists and counselors were available 
she said 
i just heard about some aid i have nothing but these 
clothes said neil hancock who lived in one of the marina 
apartment houses leveled by an earthquaketriggered fire 
the apartment building was totally demolished it burned down 
its not even a pile of rubble its a hole said hancock a 
title insurance writer 
hes been sleeping and eating at a red cross shelter although 
he moved in with a coworker sunday hes spent his days 
distributing supplies for the red cross just seeing everybody 
else being so confused and upset its contagious and scary he 
said 
hancock did not leave the relief center with a new place to live 
or any more clothes but he took several forms he would fill out 
for help later those included an application for temporary housing 
that could shelter him for up to a month but fema will take at 
least 72 hours to process that application 
reg and christine miller were on their honeymoon in france when 
the earthquake struck they came home to find themselves homeless 
weve got all our belongings sitting in an apartment we have 
no access to miller said they were allowed into their rented 
apartment in the marina district to gather clothing but the 
building is structurally damaged and considered unsafe 
the millers said inspectors hadnt decided yet if the building 
could be repaired but even if it can the millers say they are 
unsure if they will return permanently 
we always knew the marina had problems because it is built on 
a landfill we saw fourthfloor apartments at the ground floor 
level and the thought of people being trapped is pretty 
upsetting miller said 
the owner of a fourunit marina apartment building came to the 
center to find out what could be done about cracked sidewalks an 
open water main structural cracks plaster debris and other damage 
the building hasnt been inspected yet but the building next 
to it had to be bulldozed the landlord said he declined to give 
his name 
helping others has eased the shock and sense of loss for some 
people hancock said but there are so many little things that 
people dont think about 
he spent several hours at a bank saturday proving who he was 
without identification papers so he could access the modest 
balance in his savings account he waited in line at a post office 
to file a change of address form so his mail would go to a 
coworkers home rather than a charred vacant lot 
ive walked 100 miles in the last couple of days i see no 
faces i recognize getting word about my neighbors has been almost 
impossible its nuts its like nobody ever lived there i feel 
like im in cincinnati

friends of big buck helm latest 
legend in this misty mountain town arent surprised he survived 
his entombment under a collapsed freeway they say hes too tough 
and too proud to die 
bucks a happygolucky generous guy but let me tell you i 
wouldnt want him mad at me said local inn owner patsy lawrence 
hes just too arrogant to die her husband bill said with 
a grin 
now weve got something to brag about besides the fact that we 
live in the only county in the state without a single traffic 
light said mrs lawrence hes the legend of weaverville 
this town will throw a big party when buck gets back you can bet 
on it 
as helm 57 lay in a big city hospital bed after almost four 
days in his car under oaklands collapsed i880 his feat was the 
main topic in the neonlit cafes and service stations crowding this 
towns historic gold rush buildings 
out of all those people under there he was the one to get out 
alive were all just so happy said cathy heald another friend 
as she sat in helms favorite hangout the nugget restaurant i 
just knew inside he was all right 
helms survival was a shock to steven whipple an engineer with 
the state department of transporation who was inspecting the 
collapsed freeway when he saw a man wave at him through the window 
of a crushed car 
it stopped my heart said whipple i thought maybe the 
wind was blowing and thats what caused it i thought i might be 
losing it 
about five hours later helm was carried out of the rubble as 
exhausted workers cheered 
in weaverville people are aware that helms condition remains 
critical from the ordeal were praying for buck in all our 
masses said the rev john lawrence pastor at the roman catholic 
church here everybody is so glad hes alive 
buck isnt a churchgoer said peggy mcconnell a friend 
but there is a spirituality about him and thats one of the 
reasons he survived 
across the street from the weaverville hotel a small crowd 
gathered to await the arrival of a newspaper vendor so they could 
read frontpage news about old buck 
buck likes to tell a good story said a laughing jim 
nickerson who waited with the others hell get to tell this at 
least 3500 times 
nickerson was referring to the population of weaverville about 
250 miles north of san francisco in the trinity mountains the town 
depends on timber sportsmen and tourists for its livelihood 
helm has lived here off and on since boyhood he finally moved 
his wife and children back for good several years ago 
he and his wife lorene have since divorced but friends say

a new wave of homeless hit the streets on 
the weekend as safety inspectors condemned lowrent hotels damaged 
by northern californias devastating earthquake 
evacuees sought refuge in red cross shelters friends homes 
and when they could afford it other hotels that may yet be 
condemned 
the number of hotel residents displaced could hit 900 by the 
time all the citys buildings are inspected officials said 
the evacuations angered many residents both because they had 
been allowed to remain in unsafe buildings for so long and because 
they were given only a few minutes to leave 
saturday evening i came back here and saw all the commotion 
people were out on the sidewalk pretty emotional richard 
haines 52 said sunday 
he was standing outside the condemned hotel menlo wondering 
when he could return to his room in the eightstory brick building 
to pick up the rest of his belongings 
haines whose old apartment was damaged by the quake moved into 
the menlo on thursday paying a nonrefundable 137 for the week 
the building looked fairly sound the exterior was missing a few 
bricks and showed a few cracks and the interior did not appear 
seriously damaged haines said 
but engineers decided saturday that the building had sustained 
structural damage the building was condemned and residents were 
told to leave 
i got one box of clothes and my shaving gear haines said 
thats all i could take i tried to grab my tv but they said to 
leave it 
he moved to another hotel but was afraid that it too might be 
condemned and his cash is running out haines hoped to borrow 
money from coworkers when he returned to his job monday so he 
could buy lunch 
oakland emergency planner jim warland said some evacuations were 
poorly executed but that officials have changed procedures and now 
provide bus transportation and more time for residents to gather 
belongings 
its a very volatile situation warland said theyre 
frustrated and theyre frightened they dont have many 
possessions and theyre very protective of the possessions they do 
have 
the red cross already operating three shelters in oakland and 
berkeley opened another one sunday to handle the swelling numbers 
of evacuees about 400 people used the shelters saturday night 
the red cross was working with the federal emergency management 
agency to get people into more permanent housing but that process 
was frustratingly slow for people who had been cramped inside 
shelters for days 
whens this going to end victor mendonca 49 said saturday 
as he stood outside oaklands martin luther king jr elementary 
school where 160 cots were lined up in the auditorium 
despite the windwhipped rain mendonca said he had to escape 
the crowded stuffy shelter for a while 
i dont want to be here he said ive got a job all i 
dont have is a pad 
during the quake mendonca ran from his apartment under a shower 
of falling bricks saturday he was allowed to salvage belongings 
from his condemned home only to find that looters had beaten him 
to it 
they took my television and ate my food he said 
some shelter occupants said they had been promised more 
permanent housing by monday others said they were told it could be 
much longer 
many people are staying in their damaged homes often without 
electricity or gas showing up at red cross feeding stations for 
meals red cross spokesman paul miller said stations in oakland and 
berkeley were serving about 3000 meals a day 
some 4000 customers in the oakland area were without gas but 
pacific gas amp electric said it hoped to restore full service by 
monday 
a preliminary assessment showed that the quake destroyed or 
heavily damaged 120 houses 250 apartment units and 163 businesses 
in the communities of oakland berkeley albany san leandro and 
hayward all on the east side of san francisco bay miller said

stories to tell here are six personal recollections from the 1989 
earthquake 
</TEXT>

we were just sitting down trying to watch the game funny thing 
is i cant tell you what game i was starting to watch 
the first instinct ive always had with earthquakes is to wait 
for it to pass i didnt want to wait for this one we got out of 
the house in a hot hurry 
i talked to a few other vietnam vets and they all thought they 
were in country for a minute it was like a shock akin to an 
attack 
for the next 45 minutes we checked to see who had gotten hurt 
that store kathys place a general store is the whole community 
thing right there and thats where everybody met 
people worked together well nobody asked questions they just 
did i was running the generator others were stocking the shelves 
people were looking for other people trying to keep an even keel 
it was more like the way things were in country 
the worst of it is the aftershocks are not getting smaller 
theyre getting larger in vietnam you got to where you could 
sleep in a certain state you got to where your body can sleep but 
your minds awake i think thats what everyone is learning to do 
now

i was in san jose at a conference by the time i got home boy 
the phones were jammed you couldnt get out my phone wasnt 
working at home 
i hadnt realized how bad my husband was stressed out trying to 
reach me he was in puerto rico i went to work the next day 
because i knew we would have some major work to do with the agency 
once i got to work i didnt even think of my own personal life 
one of the good things you get so busy you dont really think 
about your own being 
when i got home at about 11 that night i was exhausted and went 
to bed and didnt even try to call he called me about 3 in the 
morning and absolutly cried because he was so upset i said i was 
really sorry because i knew i was ok i just was so busy trying to 
organize the workers here that i didnt even think that you would 
be worried about me so he was horrified

i was waiting for the world series to come on i was sitting on 
the bed just kicked back i was so relaxed and all of a sudden i 
heard this sound it was like a bang and i thought oh 
another little earthquake cool but then it felt like a 
giant took the building and shook it first i looked up and i saw 
the ceiling i mean the whole ceiling came down i mean all of it 
at once i said oh no 
then it shook so hard that the floor cracked it more than 
just cracked its like it broke snapped in half thats when i 
really got scared ive been through earthquakes before but not 
like this one 
i was running for the door because it kept shaking and they say 
get under a doorway i did that but that didnt work everything

i was in woolworths at market and powell when the quake hit i 
just slammed my money down on the counter and ran i said to 
myself i dont want to die in woolworths 
when the building started shaking at first i thought it might 
be from the muni trains underneath for a second i thought the 
shaking was over then there was a boom and it was like a giant 
had picked the building up and slammed it to the ground 
i almost knocked over a little old lady on the way to the 
street there was broken glass out there and a lot of dust flying 
then i went to my buildings to see if anyone was trapped in 
elevators i worked until 2 oclock and they called me at 530 
or 6 in the morning to come back in to work we all got about three 
or four hours sleep those first two nights

i was taking a nap actually christopher her 4yearold son 
was watching cartoons i heard him scream that woke me up and 
everything was really shaking 
he ran into the bedroom i grabbed him and lay down on top of 
him the first thing i thought was my god this is it i heard 
things crashing around i looked out the bedroom door and saw my 
refrigerator come out of the kitchen into the living room when 
everything stopped i packed everyone a change of clothes and left 
i didnt know what else to do 
it was like being in a tunnel underneath a freight train

i had just walked outside my girlfriends home near the forest 
of nisene marks state park about 3 miles from the epicenter 
there was no reason we talked about it later we had just walked 
outside 
i immediately said i hope the center was underneath my feet 
otherwise there are going to be a lot of people dead 
i immediately began to shake i dont believe ive stopped yet 
it seems to me that the ground shakes every once in a while but no 
one else feels it 
it seemed to me the ground went down 2 feet then immediately it 
came back up and kind of rolled around it was like the ocean going 
through the ground you could hear it coming then you feel it 
then you hear it go up there 
the worst part of the whole thing was not the earthquake it 
was over suddenly and it was done the aftershocks were a terror 
its like now its happening again but it doesnt happen

the pentagon has rejected a draft report by a 
military research center that concludes the armed forces should 
reconsider their policy of barring homosexuals from the service 
the new york times reported sunday 
a senior official said in an internal pentagon memo that the 
report was flawed offensive and wasteful of government resources 
the newspaper said 
in a statement friday the pentagon said the report did not 
respond to the original research request and has asked the author 
of the study dr theodore r sarbin to prepare another report 
dealing soley with security questions 
the unclassified report by the defense departments personnel 
security research and education center in california says the 
pentagon should reconsider its policy of barring homosexuals a 
conclusion sarbin said would most likely be repeated in the new 
report 
sarbin is a research psychologist and parttime consultant at 
the center 
the report and the pentagon correspondence were made available 
by members of congress who believe the military should stop 
discriminating against homosexuals and allow them to serve in the 
armed forces 
us rep patricia schroeder dcolo criticized the pentagon 
for rejecting the report 
the report was an excellent academic survey of available 
literature the problem is that the defense department doesnt want 
to deal with it schroeder told the times 
the internal correspondence that criticized the document said 
the report went far beyond its job of determining security risks 
posed by homosexuals in the military while it examined the general 
question of whether they were suited for the military 
the report which was completed 10 months ago dealt only 
briefly with the issue of security 
the pentagon has said that people who engage in homosexual 
behavior undermine discipline good order and morale in 1982 
that policy was expanded to include men and women who have a 
propensity to homosexual behavior 
the report said the government would probably be forced by court 
rulings to reconsider its court rulings 
the internal pentagon correspondence was written by craig 
alderman jr deputy under secretary of defense for policy he said 
the center responsible for the report had no authority to conduct 
research on whether homosexuals were suitable for military service 
he also said the pentagon found the report to be technically 
flawed to contain subject matter judeochristian precepts which 
has no place in a department of defense publication and to 
reflect significant omissions with respect to relevant court 
decisions concerning personnel security

a senior military commander was quoted sunday as 
saying that kuwait has decided against buying frenchmade mirage 
2000 jet fighters because it has enough us warplanes to meet its 
needs 
it was the first remark by a senior kuwaiti official that the 
government had decided against purchasing the french warplanes 
both the emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah and defense 
minister sheik nawaf alahmed alsabah said last month that kuwait 
had not yet decided whether to buy the sophisticated planes 
maj gen jaber khaled alsabah deputy chief of staff of the 
armed forces told the daily alanbaa that a deal with the united 
states for 40 f18 warplanes is enough to fulfill kuwaits needs 
for the time being 
kuwait considers the f18 warplane suitable for its air 
force he said but this does not mean that other planes are 
inferior to it the kuwaiti air force is not in need of more arms 
the 18 billion deal for the f18s was concluded during a visit 
to the united states last year by crown prince and prime minister 
sheik saad alabdullah alsabah delivery starts in 1994

an official newspaper accused a wellknown 
shanghai writer and dissident of polluting the thinking of 
youth by taking part in the spring prodemocracy movement and 
said he will be punished 
the blistering commentary which was published friday and seen 
in beijing on sunday was the first public attack on 71yearold 
wang ruowang a prolific essayist who was put under house arrest in 
june 
wang is a writer in name but his fame comes not from some 
outstanding writing but from some people calling him a democracy 
fighter the shanghaibased newspaper wen hui bao said in a 
halfpage commentary he even attacked comrade deng xiaoping 
calling him a power behind the throne and saying that the days 
when 11 billion people will submit to a monarch are over 
an unknown number of students professors writers and other 
intellectuals have been jailed since the army crushed the democracy 
movement in june 
hong kong papers since have reported wang was taken into 
custody but efforts to telephone his home for confirmation were 
unsuccessful 
wen hui bao did not say where wang was but said in the end he 
will be punished according to the law indicating he faces trial 
wang has been jailed both by the nationalists for supporting 
the communist revolution and by the communists for criticizing 
their failures for years the official media and publishers have 
refused to print his works but he found an outlet in hong kong 
publications 
wang was one of three intellectuals expelled from the communist 
party in 1987 after an earlier series of student protests one of 
the others was chinas most famous dissident fang lizhi 
when government controls eased in 1988 wang and other 
intellectuals founded a journal the new enlightment that 
published daring probing essays on subjects such as alienation in 
a socialist society 
he marched along with students in shanghai during the spring 
democracy movement 
wen hui bao quoted him as saying during the protests the day 
i have longed for has arrived one thing is certain once this 
student movement has begun it cannot be repressed 
for so many years wang has used his tongue and poor pen to 
oppose socialism and incite counterrevolution wen hui bao said 
his falsehoods and heresies won the acclaim of some people and 
the cheap applause of some immature youth now his set of tricks 
has been exposed

wan degui had just moved into a new house with 
three rooms when the earth came alive beneath his small village 
i only lived in it for 12 days he matteroffactedly told a 
western reporter touring the region but when the quake hit it 
just collapsed 
wan like other peasants in guiren village in northern shanxi 
province made few demands of the government after the worst quakes 
the region has seen in more than a decade 
if we can resolve it ourselves we will if not we will rely 
on what the government can do wan said but added what the 
government cannot do we will have to do ourselves 
the first of six strong tremors hit wednesday night and the 
others followed thursday leaving 29 people dead and 50000 
homeless 
in a sympathy telegram sent sunday to the quakestruck area in 
shanxi and hebei provinces about 135 miles west of beijing the 
government called on residents to show a spirit of hard struggle 
and selfreliance 
wans neighbor guan xiaoping was doing his best as the sun 
set saturday he was still sawing boards for the frame of a 
makeshift shelter he hoped would get him and his family of three 
through the winter 
his house collapsed as did 95 percent of the homes in his farm 
village of about 2400 people set on a dusty barren plain five 
people were crushed to death and two were injured wan said 
the homes were mainly onestory structures of packed clay with 
some stones and bricks to help hold them together 
three days after the quakes villagers set up housekeeping in 
tents of straw and quilts their pigs and horses roamed the dirt 
paths 
i was inside the house watching television when i heard a 
loud sound like thunder when the ground started to shake we 
rushed outside said guan 
after the third quake most of the houses had collapsed he 
said his cat was crushed to death his wife young son dog and 
another cat escaped 
his house in ruins around him guan still offered guests a 
traditional warm welcome pulling out a red vinylpadded folding 
chair and a glass of hot water boiled over an outdoor stove 
his family has been sleeping since the quake in a straw tent 
but soldiers who arrived in the village friday were helping him 
build a stronger although still temporary shelter 
yesterday there were five soldiers today there were eight 
he said altogether several hundred soldiers came to the village 
residents reported bringing clothing instant noodles crackers 
and bowls 
no one complained about the slowness of reconstruction efforts 
or the governments failure to immediately provide shelter for the 
homeless who have huddled around fires and under makeshift tents 
during the nearfreezing nights 
every family is living like this guan said we have no 
other choice 
my lips have blisters from the cold and my entire body is 
uncomfortable said liu rongxiang a matronly woman who was 
bundled in several sweaters and a quilted jacket my only hope 
now is to have a home whether its good or bad

the legislatures twoday special 
session on abortion produced no laws but will probably end up the 
most expensive such exercise in florida history 
a survey of agencies involved in the session determined that 
spending totaled more than 473000 with some reporting 
outstanding bills that are likely to push the cost to more than 
500000 
most special sessions cost about 40000 per day but past 
sessions did not involve as much planning and security as the oct 
1011 one on abortion 
more than 600 law enforcement officers stood guard while some 
20000 people demonstrated on both sides of the issue 
gov bob martinez called the session to take advantage of a us 
supreme court ruling in july allowing more curbs on abortion 
fourteen bills died in committees without reaching the floor of

it was enough to make a little girl cry 
the handcarved carousel at quassy amusement park a favorite of 
connecticut children since 1919 was auctioned off piece by piece 
to highrolling antiques dealers and collectors for a total of 
638000 
by saturday afternoon the four dozen wooden horses zebras 
giraffes and other animals that had ridden together for decades 
were being separated and taken to faraway places like new jersey 
alabama and washington state 
it chokes you up a lot more than you thought it would said 
george frantzis whose family has owned the amusement park for 
three decades 
the merrygoround was built in 1902 quassy bought it in 1919 
and operated it until this summer experts say only about 70 
handcarved wooden carousels remain of the estimated 6000 that 
dotted the american landscape at the turn of the century 
the quassy carousel fell victim to a trend a bidding frenzy 
among private art collectors that has caused the value of antique 
carousels to skyrocket the frantzis family said it could no longer 
afford to maintain or insure the carousel and decided to replace it 
with one made of fiberglass 
bidding opened when jimmy filler a scrapiron dealer from 
birmingham ala bid 20000 on the prize of the carousel a lion 
seattle antiques dealer sam pemberton outbid filler offering 
60000 he said he would restore the lion and sell it 
weve never had a lion and we wanted to get one pemberton 
said 
one after another the wooden animals were sold sea horses 
camels reindeers a tiger and a goat 
a camel went for 25000 a tiger for 45000 a giraffe for 
27500 and finally the wulitzer organ went for 21500 filler 
ended up buying six animals 
the frantzis family had hoped a collector would purchase the 
entire carousel and keep it intact but no one came forward 
schoolchildren in old saybrook even wrote to donald trump asking 
him to buy the merrygoround 
but trump was not in the park when bidding on the individual 
pieces was complete and auctioneer david norton offered one last 
chance to keep the colorful herd together a bid of 766000 20 
percent above the total of the separate bids would have saved the 
carousel no one raised a hand 
the machine has been sold piecemeal norton shouted

the government banned her the 
antiapartheid movement censured her and potential legal battles 
cloud her future but winnie mandela has survived and is reclaiming 
her role as one of south africas most prominent and defiant 
activists 
mrs mandela wife of jailed african national congress leader 
nelson mandela vanished from public view in february when leading 
antiapartheid groups repudiated her and accused her selfappointed 
bodyguards of waging a reign of terror 
in recent weeks however mrs mandela has emerged with 
highprofile appearances at several opposition rallies the 
relentless speculation about her husbands release expected within 
several months keeps her at the center of the political stage 
she is blunt rash emotional and speaks from the heart that 
is why people respond to her and why she is controversial said 
fatima meer author of a bestselling biography of nelson mandela 
even during the crisis winnie had the support and loyalty of 
many many people mrs meer said in an interview she will 
remain highly visible and widely respected 
when six of mandelas closest anc colleagues were freed from 
prison oct 15 mrs mandela accommodated one of them wilton 
mkwayi at her home in soweto the huge black township outside 
johannesburg 
she appeared that day at a rally for the freed prisoners she 
prepared to sit alongside them at a news conference but activists 
who organized the meeting politely directed her to a seat behind 
the anc leaders 
the releases are widely seen as a trial run for freeing mandela 
71 the countrys best known black leader and possibly the worlds 
most famous prisoner his release is considered necessary before 
black leaders even relatively conservative ones will negotiate 
with the whiteled government 
mandela lives in a suburbanstyle ranch house on a prison farm 
outside cape town in recent months he has met several times with 
his wife as well as with antiapartheid leaders who denounced her 
mandela reportedly told his wife not to talk to the press she 
remained silent for several months but has begun to speak out again 
i am of no significance to anybody as an individual she 
told tribute magazine to attack me is to attack mandela to 
attack the anc 
there has been no formal public reconciliation between mrs 
mandela and the antiapartheid movement but the overt criticism of 
her has stopped 
one activist who requested anonymity said antiapartheid groups 
are attempting to resolve their disputes with mrs mandela before 
her husband is released but several problems remain he 
refused to elaborate 
several antiapartheid leaders including some who earlier 
denounced mrs mandela for violating human rights in the name of 
the struggle against apartheid refused recently to speak about 
her on the record 
the anc has expressed concern about some of her statements and 
spokesman tom sebina based in lusaka zambia noted she has no 
formal position in the organization but he added that mrs mandela 
remains an important part of the struggle 
mrs mandelas provocative statements and courageous defiance of 
government restrictions made her one of the most visible symbols of 
black resistance her followers often referred to her as mother 
of the nation 
she married mandela in 1958 when she was a 24yearold social 
worker and he was a 40yearold anc leader four years later he was 
arrested and he has been imprisoned ever since 
she was under police restrictions almost continuously from 1963 
to 1986 was arrested numerous times and held in solitary 
confinement for 17 months in 196970 the repeated police action 
only inspired defiance in mrs mandela now 55 and the mother of 
two grown daughters 
she often appeared at funerals of slain activists dressed in 
flowing dresses of black green and gold the colors of the 
outlawed anc to give fiery speeches and clenchedfist salutes 
but her questionable political judgment sometimes imperious 
style and reluctance to consult with antiapartheid groups led her 
into repeated conflict with both the white authorities and the 
black community 
longsimmering disputes boiled over early this year when mrs 
mandelas bodyguards known as the mandela united soccer club were 
accused of abducting four youths and beating one of them 
14yearold stompie seipei to death 
nine people associated with the club are in custody for the 
boys death he allegedly was kidnapped by the soccer team in 
december and beaten at mrs mandelas home 
seipeis body was found in a field and the other three youths 
have given affidavits implicating members of mandela united the 
group seldom played soccer but often stayed at mrs mandelas home 
and accompanied her at public appearances they were involved in 
repeated confrontations with police journalists and local street 
gangs 
the accused in custody since february have pleaded innocent 
no trial date has been set 
antiapartheid groups said in february they were outraged at 
mrs mandelas complicity in the abductions and assault of 
stompie 
she has denied any wrongdoing police maj gen jaap joubert 
who headed the investigation declined to comment when asked if she 
might be charged 
the death of seipei was one of several controversies that have 
dogged mrs mandela since she unilaterally lifted her police 
banning order in 1985 
at a rally in 1986 she endorsed the necklace killings 
whereby militant activists torched gasolinesoaked tires placed 
around necks of suspected government collaborators 
the government then lifted the ban on quoting mrs mandela in 
the apparent belief she would do more harm to her reputation by 
speaking out than by being silenced 
in 1987 she was sharply criticized for building a mansion on a 
hillside in soweto surrounded by tiny overcrowded matchbox 
houses mandela reportedly has told his wife not to move into the 
house 
the mandelas small rented home was burned in a july 1988 arson 
attack by soweto youths feuding with the soccer club community 
leaders urged mrs mandela to disband the team but she ignored 
their advice

state trooper scott smith didnt hestitate 
to jump a fence to reach a drowning baby kangaroo but the idea of 
mouthtosnout resuscitation gave him a moments pause 
nevertheless the trooper said he blew into the nose a couple 
of quick breaths and that brought it right around 
the ogden man was watching the kangaroos at hogle zoo with his 
family earlier this month when a female kangaroo hopped over to a 
pond for a drink and her 18inchtall baby called a joey 
followed 
something spooked the joey and it jumped and when it jumped 
it landed in the water smith said 
two black swans began flapping their wings driving the joey 
into deeper water 
my wife started screaming at me scott its drowning its 
drowning he said so he jumped the fence and pulled the animal 
to safety 
smith said he could feel the joeys rapid heartbeat slow and its 
eyes became glassy the mouth was clamped shut so he puffed into 
the nose 
some of it boils down to pride im in this thing this far i 
cant let it die now he said 
richard andrews a foreman at the zoo said the joey was placed 
back in its hutch on soft bedding under a heat lamp and was 
recovering

sophisticated antitank weapons have 
helped cambodian guerrillas score unprecedented victories against 
the vietnambacked government according to western diplomats and 
senior resistance officials 
this is the most important weapon we have ever received 
said gen dien del deputy commander of the khmer peoples national 
liberation front we can now defend ourselves against tanks 
the liberation front and another guerrilla faction reportedly 
have received several hundred armorpiercing antitank rockets in 
the past few months 
the weapons were used in the recent offensive in northwestern 
cambodia in which guerrillas seized several key towns and a number 
of government military positions according to western diplomats 
and guerrilla sources interviewed last week 
the liberation front and a group loyal to prince norodom 
sihanouk are loosely allied with the communist khmer rouge in a war 
against cambodias vietnamsupported government which was 
installed after vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and ousted 
the khmer rouge from power 
the newly acquired weapons are the west german 67mm armbrust 
the 84mm swedish carl gustav and the 89mm french lrac say the 
diplomats and resistance sources 
both the armbrust and the gustav came to the two noncommunist 
factions through singapore while the french weapons provided only 
to the sihanouk group came as part of a larger package of weapons 
from france earlier this year according to the sources 
france has denied shipping weapons to the resistance 
we receive many weapons we dont know where they come from 
or who pays for them i dont know and i dont want to know said 
dr abdul gaffar the liberation fronts senior military analyst 
senior resistance sources who requested anonymity said they 
strongly pressured the united states and key asian supporters to 
help them acquire the weapons more recently the resistance argued 
the weapons would be vital to an offensive planned to begin 
immediately after last months pullout of vietnamese forces from 
cambodia 
supplied mostly by china the guerrillas have previously been 
limited to light weapons government forces are supplied by the 
soviet union with tanks heavy artillery and a small fleet of 
fighter planes and assault helicopters 
guerrillas claim to have destroyed more than 10 tanks armored 
personnel carriers and heavy trucks in the first two weeks of 
october more than twice the number they knocked out in the 
decadelong war 
the antitank missiles were first deployed in the offensive that 
began only four days after vietnam said it withdrew its last troops 
from cambodia on sept 26 
the resistance was unable to hold significant territory until 
this month 
this will do for us what the stingers did for afghanistan 
dien del said 
us stinger antiaircraft missiles sent to the guerrillas in 
afganistan are widely believed to have turned the tide in favor of 
the resistance several years ago 
bangkokbased diplomats say requests for weaponry and supplies 
go through the cambodian working group composed of representatives 
from the united states thailand singapore and malaysia the 
bangkokbased group reviews battle plans before approving weapons 
requests 
the united states pays the cost of some antitank weapons 
training reliable sources say 
washington denies providing lethal aid to the resistance but a 
legal aid program exists that could include nonlethal military 
assistance 
on a recent tour by the associated press of territory captured 
by the resistance several soviet tanks and heavy transport trucks 
were seen destroyed near the key towns of thmar pouk banteay 
chmar and kandoul in the northwestern cambodian province of 
battambang 
it is absolutely essential that we continue to have antitank 
weapons abdul gaffar said if we ran out of antitank weapons 
tommorow the day after tommorow the phnom penh tanks would roll 
over our positions

maine residents face changes in the way 
they live work and play as the state phases in the nations most 
farreaching returnablecontainer law 
by next september refundable deposits will be required on every 
nondairy drink container up to a gallon in size from tiny jars 
of baby juice to liquor bottles 
all nonreturnable containers including singleserving juice 
boxes will be banned as will the plastic yokes that hold 
sixpacks together 
environmentalists are delighted with the law saying it sets a 
standard for the nation that will reduce rubbish and litter save 
energy used in producing containers and promote conservation 
basically they took a good thing and made it better pat 
franklin of the national container recycling coalition in 
washington said of maine lawmakers i really think maine will be 
leading the way on this 
others like grocer hugh holmes of farmingdale are unhappy 
holmes said his market has already run out of space for storing 
returned containers and he may have to convert an office into a 
usedcan bin 
its absolutely scary said holmes 
maines bottle law was approved by referendum in 1976 
voters resoundingly reaffirmed their support and stopped an 
industrybacked repeal campaign in 1979 
the current law similar to those in force in fewer than a dozen 
other states bans nonreturnable containers for beer and soda and 
requires consumers to pay a deposit for each can or bottle the 
deposit is refunded when the consumer turns in the container 
under legislation enacted this year that will be expanded in 
steps 
as of jan 1 anyone who brings more than 48 no deposit 
cans or bottles into the state will face fines of 20 per 
container also on that date maine joins a handful of states that 
charge deposits for liquor bottles 15 cents each 
on sept 1 all throwaway nondairy beverage containers will 
be banned 
on july 1 1991 plastic sixpack yokes which do not 
decompose readily and have been known to entangle and kill birds 
and other animals will be banned 
national soft drink association legislative analyst virginia 
mccoy said the ban is the only one of its kind in the nation 
although the legislation was the product of extended 
negotiations among diverse interests some industry officials have 
vowed to step up efforts to weaken the law before the changes take 
effect they maintain that aggressive but voluntary recycling is 
preferable 
gerber products cos rick jarman said his company will ask the 
legislature to exempt baby juice jars he warned that the added 
costs of special labeling required by the law would be passed onto 
consumers 
targeted for special opposition by industry is the ban on 
aseptic containers or juice boxes which environmentalists say 
are not recyclable because they contain mixed layers of plastic 
paper and aluminum 
its an entirely different thing to say were going to mess 
with your business than to say were going to terminate your 
business said linda smith dyer a lobbyist for tetra pak inc 
a connecticut company that calls its product environmentally 
friendly 
dyer said her company may have an ally in consumers who find 
the containers handy to pack in lunch pails and backpacks 
polls show strong popular support said state sen judy c kany 
cochairwoman of the legislative committee that refined the measure 
my phone has been ringing off the hook with offers of help 
to keep the law alive said sharon treat lobbyist for the natural 
resources council of maine

in the aftermath of the friday the 13th stock 
market dive treasury secretary nicholas bradys political stock 
has risen for successfully avoiding the pitfalls that ensnared the 
reagan administration two years ago 
before the crisis the lowkey brady tended to pale in 
comparisons with his predecessor james a baker iii now secretary 
of state 
but in spearheading the government effort to prevent the crash 
of 87 from repeating itself brady is winning praise for deft 
handling of the situation 
it was clear that the government stood prepared to help 
prevent a repeat of that 508point debacle said allen sinai 
chief economist of the boston co the policymakers all said the 
right things and helped to contain any problems 
when the market dropped 108 points on a friday two years ago it 
followed with a 508point plunge the next monday this time 
fridays 190point decline was largely offset by an 88point rise 
the next monday 
that success notwithstanding brady hinted in an interview 
friday that he may soon recommend several steps aimed at promoting 
more coordination among regulators he would not be specific about 
what changes were being considered 
in a free enterprise system government policymakers are not 
necessarily concerned with imposing rules that inhibit the normal 
ebb and flow of market forces but they are concerned when other 
factors particularly those unique to the highspeed computer 
driven trading of the modern era threaten to undermine or 
overwhelm the more natural forces 
in addition to directing the factfinding operation that insured 
a supply of accurate information upon which to base decisions 
during the market plunge earlier this month brady worked to have 
government policymakers from the president on down speak with one 
voice to project an air of calm 
this time there was no verbal gaffe to worry markets such as 
thensec chairman david ruders comment to reporters two years ago 
that trading might be halted a remark widely believed to have led 
to further panic selling 
other key roles were played this year by federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan who also navigated the shoals of the 87 
crash gerald corrigan head of the new york federal reserve bank 
and richard breeden the new chairman of the securities and 
exchange commission 
but brady who took the lead in the crisismanagement effort 
and his top aides at the treasury department are coming in for much 
of the congratulations for avoiding a repeat of black monday 
reviewing events during the interview in his office brady 
played down his own role saying policymakers were better prepared 
this time around and armed with more sophisticated means of 
monitoring market developments 
brady was on hand monday morning watching the flashing signals 
that tracked developments in the stock markets stock futures 
international currency and bond trading not only in the united 
states but in markets around the world 
for brady market monitoring was nothing new he spent 35 years 
on wall street as an investment banker he also headed the brady 
commission the panel which issued the first and many believe the 
best review of the causes of the record 508point market plunge on 
oct 19 1987 
in addition the two harvard professors who directed the brady 
commission investigation are now working as top aides to brady at 
the treasury department 
known as the gold dust twins robert glauber treasury 
undersecretary for finance and david w mullins treasury 
assistant secretary for domestic finance are considered experts on 
the operations of financial markets 
when the market began tumbling late in the afternoon on oct 13 
brady turned to these two aides to launch a factfinding operation 
that continued throughout the weekend 
in 1987 when the stock market fell 108 points on the friday 
before black monday the response was far different at that time 
baker was in a highly publicized feud with west germany over 
international economic coordination 
bakers pointed criticism of interest rate increases in west 
germany which he continued through that weekend unnerved 
investors and were considered extremely illtimed given the 
volatility in the markets 
this time brady and others in the administration went out of 
their way to emphasize that us officials were in close 
consultation and coordination with major us allies 
the federal reserve did its part by letting it be known that it 
stood ready to inject large doses of cash into the banking system 
as a way of assuring jittery markets that cashshort brokerage 
houses would not have to sell off more stock because they could not 
get bank loans 
the fed under greenspan performed the same function in 1987 but 
only after the huge monday selloff had occurred by getting word 
of its intentions out over the weekend the fed helped remove a 
major area of uncertainty 
behind the scenes treasurys factfinding operation was turning 
up some encouraging signs that 1989 would not be a repeat of 1987 
for one thing there were technical signs in the trading data 
suggesting that computer trading programs that had been harmful in 
1987 would not be a factor this time 
in another turnaround from 1987 checks with 24hour mutual fund 
hotlines indicated no rush on the part of investors to sell their 
holdings 
armed with this information brady convened a meeting in his 
office late sunday with greenspan breeden and various aides to 
review plans for the monday morning market opening 
in an effort to avoid any sense of panic greenspan kept a 
scheduled speech monday morning before the american bankers 
association while brady attended the regular 7 am white house 
staff meeting to counsel calm 
his message you shouldnt look at this loss on friday as some 
cataclysmic event but more as an instantaneous technical 
reaction to a market that was somewhat overvalued 
i dont think anybody had an air of panic brady says in 
assessing the mood as the markets opened monday

from a distance it is a stark desolate 
array of odd gray columns up close it is an eerie display of 
automobile history 
art or junk this creation of old vehicles called carhenge 
attracts hundreds of people to the sandhills of northwestern 
nebraska where residents are debating whether the monument or 
automobile graveyard should be preserved 
james reinders a houston oil consultant created carhenge in 
1987 as a takeoff on the ancient religious and astronomical site 
stonehenge on salisbury plain in england instead of colossal 
stones he used cars 
he arranged 22 aging plymouths fords chevrolets even an 
ambulance in a wheat field two miles north of alliance sixteen 
cars are planted trunk down with their front ends in the air six 
more sit atop them forming arches 
in alliance a community of 9900 city officials are debating 
whether to enforce a permit that requires reinders to pave the 
entry to carhenge by july 15 1990 or see it torn down 
a group called friends of carhenge headed by city councilman 
paul phaneuf incorporated last week and wants to raise the 2000 
for the paving 
reinders says he already pays for liability on his property and 
is not interested in paying for paving 
this is really good for alliance and it didnt cost anybody 
anything said phaneuf finally someone has given us something 
of value 
its wonderful for us said martin marnett manager of a 
local fastfood restaurant it has created so much interest 
and it does put a grin on your face 
on nov 2 the council will vote on a request to change the 
zoning of the land from agricultural to commercial eliminating the 
need for paving 
janet steele executive director of the alliance chamber of 
commerce said carhenge detractors were vocal until a comment box 
was installed at the site in august it drew 425 responses in the 
first 20 days most of them overwhelmingly favorable 
critics argue the car pile should be torn down because it is 
unsightly some say it is nothing more than a junkyard 
besides carhenge and the annual heritage days in july there 
isnt much to bring people to alliance 
highway 2 runs east through town into the scenic sandhills but 
for outofstate folks the closest wonder is mount rushmore three 
hours away in south dakota

the decision by three north african girls to wear 
moslem head coverings to junior high school has exploded into an 
intense national debate over religion in public schools 
at issue is the secularity of education enshrined in french law 
since the official separation of the church and the state in this 
largely roman catholic country in 1905 
some argue that wearing the hijab a scarf that covers the 
hair ears and neck is tantamount to proselytism 
about 400 people shouting god is great in arabic 
demonstrated in paris on sunday to support the teenagers women 
wearing moslem scarves carried banners that said the hijab is 
our honor 
the demonstration was called by the islamic association of 
france and the voice of islam which organized demonstrations a few 
months ago against the salman rushdie novel the satanic verses 
the two groups however represent only a minority of moslems in 
france 
the controversy over the scarves began in october at creil 40 
miles north of paris when leila achahoun 15 her sister fatima 
14 and their friend samira 14 all of tunisian origin were told 
by the principal they could not wear the hijab to school 
the girls demurred the debate grew negotiations started 
similar cases sprang up in marseille avignon and montpellier a 
compromise was reached at creil the girls were allowed to wear 
hijabs to school but not in class again they demurred 
religious leaders moslem jewish and christian seemed to see 
little harm in the wearing of the hijab but school and union 
leaders came down soundly on the side of keeping all signs of 
religion out of schools saying secularity is one of the pillars of 
french democracy political leaders waffled 
alain goldmann the grand rabbi of paris reasoned that it would 
not harm other children to be aware of the differences between 
people they learn to know and respect others he said 
bernard antony of the extreme right national front said wearing 
the hijab was the beginning of the lebanonization of france 
because it is obvious that if we continue to allow hundreds of 
thousands of moslems to enter france we cannot indefinitely 
deprive them of their customs their rites and when they become 
the majority they will not hesitate to apply the charia islamic 
law 
islam is the secondlargest religion in france with 25 million 
adherents 
ernest chenieres principal of the gabriel havez junior high 
school in creil says he is only doing his job applying french 
regulations regarding religion in schools 
the scarf clearly is a proselytic declaration by the three 
girls he said imagine if it was not just three young girls but 
1000 or 50000 
in montpellier 14yearold loubma ryad who had been wearing 
her scarf to school more than two years suddenly was asked to 
stop her parents withdrew her from school 
irans official islamic republic news agency criticized the 
french for invoking an old law against moslems while wearing of 
crosses by christian students and the special hats by jews or 
their absence from classrooms on saturdays has not caused any 
problems for the secular schools in france 
danielle mitterrand wife of president francois mitterrand 
said if 200 years after the revolution secularity is not able 
to welcome all religions all the religious expressions in 
france it would be a step backward if the veil is the expression 
of religion we must accept traditions whatever they may be 
but khorsi sadok vice president of the association of french of 
algerian origin said mrs mitterrand had missed the point and was 
adding her support to a fundamentalist operation aimed at 
stopping the emancipation of moslem women 
yannick simbron secretarygeneral of the national education 
federation the countrys largest teachers union said the right 
to education must take precedence over religious customs 
sheik tedjini haddam who as rector of the grand mosque of paris 
is considered the top moslem authority in france said he was 
indignant at the attitude of school officials 
if a young girl asks that her hair be covered i think that it 
is her most elementary right he said adding that not only was 
the hijab not a religious statement it was perhaps a reaction to 
certain modern clothes that were indecent 
cardinal jeanmarie lustiger the archbishop of paris warned 
against confusing the problems of islam with those of 
adolescence comparing it to the wearing of dreadlocks long thin 
braids worn originally by rastafarians

the master paintings and sculptures of the 
phillips collection the oldest museum of modern art in america 
are luxuriating in bright new gallery spaces after a 78 million 
expansion financed largely by a wealthy japanese businessman 
the new goh annex which opened in late september after two 
years of construction more than doubles the private museums 
exhibition to more than 30000 square feet and ushers the 
phillips into the next century with stateofthe art features 
comparable to the finest public museums 
new storage and picturehandling facilities climate control 
equipment a conservation laboratory and education classrooms made 
possible by the latest expansion the sixth since pittsburgh steel 
and banking heir duncan phillips founded the museum in 1921 in his 
redbrick mansion near dupont circle 
when phillips opened three rooms of his home as a public 
gallery his collection consisted of 237 paintings today the 
museum houses about 2500 works of art many of them acquired and 
donated by phillips and his artist wife marjorie 
the cornerstone of the museums collection is pierre auguste 
renoirs the luncheon of the boating party the impressionist 
masterpiece which phillips bought in 1923 for 125000 other 
notable holdings include el grecos the repentant peter paul 
cezannes self portrait edgar degas dancers at the bar 
and paul gauguins still life with ham 
the old masters form the backdrop for the works of modern 
artists that phillips sought to support and encourage from pierre 
bonnard to such american modernists as georgia okeeffe john marin 
and arthur dove 
the art collection grew so rapidly that it literally forced the 
phillips out of their neogeorgian mansion in 1930 and they moved 
to another home in 1960 a threestory annex with sculpture garden 
was built next door 
the new goh annex expanded the 1960 building outward and added a 
fourth floor the latest addition was named for yasuhiro goh a 
japanese art patron and pioneer of ocean transportation of liquid 
gases who donated 15 million to the phillips last year 
goh first toured the phillips during a visit to washington in 
1951 he wrote later that the museum has stayed fixed in my mind 
since that time as an expression of individual endeavor and 
initiative he said his grant was a gesture of gratitude to the 
united states where he and his three children were educated 
funds for the goh annex came mostly from individuals 
corporations and foundations the same private sources that provide 
the bulk of the museums annual 3 million operating budget the 
phillips also raised 1 million for the expansion project by 
sending 85 of its master paintings on a 1987 tour of europe and 
australia 
besides proceeds from a 3 million endowment established by 
duncan phillips before his death in 1966 the museum also receives 
an occasional federal grant from the national endowment for the 
arts to underwrite some of the four to six special exhibitions it 
mounts annually 
laughlin phillips son of the founder and former publisher of 
washingtonian magazine succeeded his father as the museums 
director 
over the years the phillips has become a beloved institution to 
a loyal and steadily growing audience of art lovers who enjoy the 
quiet unhurried ambience of the mansions stately halls as if 
they are welcome guests free to linger over a favorite painting as 
long as they wish 
by 1986 before construction began on the goh annex the number 
of annual visitors had reached 156000 
a popular phillips tradition since the 1940s has been the sunday 
afternoon series of free recitals by promising young professional 
musicians held in a long hall that was added to the mansion in 
1907 
among the musicians whose early careers included performances in 
the phillips music room were opera singer jessye norman and 
pianists emanuel ax and glenn gould

shot from the base at what are believed to be rebel strongholds in 
the paghman mountains outside of kabul every 30 seconds a large 
boom echoed outside the base as another missile blasted off

crashed into into her mud house a child was injured when a rocket 
plowed through a mud wall and sprayed shrapnel around a courtyard

steven whipple thought he might be 
hallucinating when he saw a man wave at him through the window of a 
crushed car trapped in the rubble of a collapsed doubledeck 
freeway 
it stopped my heart whipple a california department of 
transportation engineer said sunday i thought maybe the wind 
was blowing and thats what caused it i thought i might be losing 
it 
he looked again and this time he thought he saw the mans head 
move in an effort to turn around 
whipple immediately called coworkers on a radio to report that 
he might have found someone alive 
about five hours later on saturday 57yearold buck helm was 
carried out of the rubble as exhausted workers cheered and renewed 
efforts to find more survivors of tuesdays earthquake 
helm listed in critical condition at highland general hospital 
was the first person found alive in the collapse of the i880 
freeway since the first night more than threedozen bodies have 
been removed 
whipple who is 29 and lives in pittsburg calif normally 
spends his time inspecting highway structures that are about to be 
worked on by contractors but like other transportation department 
employees he has done a variety of jobs since the disaster 
saturday he was inspecting a portion of the nimitz where workers 
planned to remove crushed cars later in the day he was checking 
the structure for stability but what he saw made him question his 
own stability 
as he told a news conference sunday he was working in tomblike 
silence by the light of a flashlight in narrow spaces with a clear 
view of helms car 30 to 40 feet away 
thats when he thought he saw a hand come up and wave through a 
side window whipple said 
he waved at me it surprised me he said 
unsure of what he had seen he looked again and the second 
movement convinced him there finally was a survivor of the nimitz 
disaster 
i was a bit shaky when i started calling on the radio to let 
the other guys know we had a live person in here and shook for 20 
minutes afterward he said 
whipple stayed on the scene as rescue workers dug helm out he 
said he has not tried to contact the injured man because he does 
not want to interfere with his medical care

after fleeing south carolina with 
hurricane hugo gusting at his heels the last thing darrel dixon 
expected was to be caught in the middle of one of the nations 
worst earthquake disasters 
but as the utah businessman walked through san franciscos 
chinatown shortly after 5 pm tuesday the sidewalk began to rock 
under his feet 
it was really scary he recalled sunday a lot of people 
were running outside i looked up at the buildings around me 
wondering if they would come down and i ran into the middle of the 
street 
dixon who travels around the country selling wastewater 
treatment equipment said the coincidence of confronting two of the 
biggest natural disasters in us history was a little spooky 
his wife melva agrees 
once in a lifetime maybe she said but not twice 
especially in a threeweek period 
dixon is a group product manager for salt lake citybased eimco 
an equipment manufacturer once known as eastern iron metal company 
he was in san francisco to pitch his companys products at the 
water pollution control federation conference 
just a few weeks before on sept 21 dixon was conducting 
seminars for engineers and consultants on kiawah island just south 
of charleston when authorities ordered the resort community 
evacuated 
the next morning the winds were starting to blow we went 
ahead and got off the island dixon remembered the airport 
closed so we drove a rental car down to atlanta and flew out of 
there hugo hit that night 
i got back into salt lake city in time to watch the news 
accounts of it hitting charleston he said adding he felt both 
relieved and a bit guilty about having made it out in time 
you kind of feel like youre leaving these people behind he 
said 
there was no escape from witnessing disaster last tuesday 
however 
after the shaking stopped dixon hurried back to his downtown 
hotel with electricity out he climbed the stairs in gathering 
darkness to his seventhfloor room it was while he was in the 
shower that an aftershock hit 
it kind of knocked me around a bit the main thing i could 
think of was i wanted to hurry up and get out of there because if 
the hotel came down i wanted to have some clothes on dixon said 
the next morning on a trip that took nearly five hours to cross 
the golden gate bridge alone dixon and associates drove a rented 
car to sacramento to catch flights home 
friends have joked with him that he should stay home from now 
on but dixon and his wife plan to go to hawaii for their 22nd 
wedding anniversary next march 
people have warned me that if i do a volcano will probably 
erupt while im there dixon said

in a crowded east berlin subway train commuters 
shake their heads in disbelief as they flip through the communist 
party newspaper neues deutschland its pages brimming with workers 
complaints and admissions of official bungling 
in an apartment not far from the berlin wall an east berlin 
family switches off a variety show on west german television to 
tune in to the statecontrolled nightly newscast 
we havent watched it for years but we make sure we do now 
said ulrike schmidt a 38yearold schoolteacher 
in less than a week after the ouster of reformresistant party 
leader erich honecker east germanys news media have shed their 
drab and doctrinaire image and given voice to unprecedented debate 
over the troubled nations problems 
although the media still toe the partys leading role line 
the transformation has been as dramatic as it has been swift 
long scorned by east germans who looked west for the news the 
media have embarked on a campaign of relative openness about the 
causes of the nations current unrest 
the shift has left many east germans both amazed and skeptical 
for years the media here were a joke said joachim lenz a 
25yearold student at east berlins humboldt university they 
had nothing to do with reality and the newspapers were full of 
interviews with happy workers while the rest were packing up to go 
west 
one of the most frequent demands made by prodemocracy activists 
has been for a freer more lively press 
although there is still no legal alternative to the staterun 
press government media have begun to respond to the widespread 
calls for broader more realistic news coverage 
a day after egon krenz took over as party leader last week 
neues deutschland devoted four pages to critical examination of the 
nations problems including the flight of more than 55000 east 
germans to the west 
for the first time in their 40year history east germanys 
media have offered prompt coverage of the prodemocracy street 
protests and other opposition events 
on saturday two senior communist party officials engaged in an 
unusually candid debate with east germans who had just marched 
through downtown east berlin in demand of reforms less than two 
hours later footage of the heated exchange between east berlin 
party chief guenter schabowski and mayor erhard krack was shown on 
the nightly news show aktuelle kamera 
east german television now routinely broadcasts live interviews 
with state officials who were rarely seen a few weeks ago and 
whose policies were never questioned openly 
in a live tv callin show thursday the day after krenz assumed 
power east germans grilled communist officials on the governments 
long history of commandstyle leadership and its tight restrictions 
on foreign travel 
another television program geared to teenagers broadcast an 
interview with a dissident lutheran church pastor and concluded 
we filmed this two weeks ago but until now we couldnt show it 
junge welt one of the most widely read newspapers in the 
country on saturday carried a forthright report on democratic 
developments in hungary a first for a publication that had often 
ignored the reforms sweeping other east european nations 
officials also have revoked a nearly yearold ban on the soviet 
monthly magazine sputnik whose critical articles on late soviet 
dictator josef stalin and german communists before world war ii had 
angered hardline east german leaders 
while the discussions of social and economic problems 
encumbering east germany are unprecedented in official media here 
the more candid reports do not yet measure up to the level of 
openness of soviet media since kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev 
introduced his policy of glasnost three years ago 
direct criticism of officials in power remains absent and there 
have been no challenges to the communist partys monopoly on power 
many east germans say governmentrun media must become far more 
critical and objective to gain the confidence of the people 
right now its a curiosity because no one has ever seen this 
happening before said ingrid mueller a 45yearold east berlin 
secretary they still have a long way to go

the cincinnati zoo has kept dozens of 
antelopes cows and tigers in an 8by8foot storage closet for 
nearly nine years 
but now one of the worlds largest collections of frozen animal 
embryos has outgrown its laboratory and the zoo has begun work on 
a 34 million facility expected to open in 14 months 
groundbreaking was saturday 
dr betsy dresser director of the zoos center for reproduction 
and endangered wildlife is counting on the 16000squarefoot lab 
to help save animals from extinction 
its a safety net she said instead of feeding a herd of 
rhinoceroses you can keep them frozen 
the frozen zoo preserves species genetic material while 
conservationists try to save their habitat or find room for them in 
captivity 
if we had been able to do this for the dinosaurs we could 
bring them back today she said 
despite the limitations of working in the converted mop closet 
she said the frozen zoo has produced 14 world firsts since the 
project started in 1981 one was the birth in february of a rare 
indian desert cat through testtube fertilization of a house cat 
successes have spawned similar research programs in san diego 
washington and london 
cincinnati is leading the way said thomas foose 
conservation director for the american association of zoological 
parks and aquariums in bethesda md this type of research is 
crucial to the survival of a lot of species 
private grants and fund drives will pay for the new center 
which will accommodate up to 50 scientists ms dresser said 
officials hope to encourage scientific as well as financial 
interest by offering tours to visitors

the bush administrations reluctance to grant 
diplomatic recognition to vietnam stems from the bitter legacy of 
military defeat say a handful of congressmen who argue that 
vietnam has met us requirements for improving ties 
were punishing vietnam for inflicting a very embarrassing 
failure on the us 14 years ago said rep robert mrazek dny 
sen robert kerrey dneb who lost part of a leg in vietnam 
said the administration isnt thinking through its asian policy 
very well it is driven by the same lack of understanding that led 
us to the bumbling mistakes of vietnam 
that argument however is rejected by administration officials 
and what appears to be a majority in congress 
obviously theres a bitter legacy but it doesnt dictate our 
policy said a senior administration official who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity 
as a condition for establishing diplomatic relations with 
vietnam for the first time since the fall of the usbacked 
saigon government in 1975 the bush administration demanded an end 
to the 11year vietnamese military occupation of neighboring 
cambodia 
the vietnamese say the last of their troops withdrew from 
cambodia last month but normalization of ties is stalled over the 
makeup of a new cambodia government that the bush administration 
seeks to replace hun sen installed by vietnam and still in power 
the dispute over the cambodian government said the bush 
administration official is not a new barrier weve erected to 
protect ourselves from the specter of normalization with vietnam 
it is part of the package he said 
critics of administration policy say recognizing vietnam would 
raise us influence throughout the region 
we must for our strategic and national interests get back to 
vietnam to reassert us influence in southeast asia and compete 
with china the soviet union and japan said mrazek 
us policy is still influenced by feelings of anger and 
desire for revenge motives that ill suit a just and powerful 
nation said rep chester atkins dmass 
at an international conference on cambodia in paris last july 
vietnam refused to support a proposal to include cambodias khmer 
rouge guerrillas in an interim government that would be led by 
usbacked opposition leader prince norodom sihanouk 
the khmer rouge who ruled cambodia 197578 while in power 
killed an estimated 1 million compatriots in an effort to restore 
the nation to a primitive agrarian society 
khmer rouge leaders now fighting a guerrilla war in the jungles 
along the thaicambodian border claim to have changed their ways 
and have strong chinese backing to be included as one of four 
cambodian factions in a coalition government 
in paris the vietnamese balked at including the khmer rouge 
and are backing hun sen 
the united states accused vietnam of intransigence saying 
inclusion of the militarily strong khmer rouge loathsome as it 
may be is essential for achieving a negotiated settlement in 
cambodia such a settlement would include a halt of foreign arms 
supplies to all parties an international monitoring force and free 
elections 
in that context the khmer rouge would be containable said 
the senior administration official 
mrazek and several other lawmakers argue that it is hypocritical 
to criticize vietnam for opposing the chinesebacked khmer rouge 
and accuse the administration of backing a khmer rouge presence in 
an interim government for fear of antagonizing china 
among the administration supporters on the issue is sen john 
mccain an arizona republican and former prisoner of war who last 
year sponsored a bill to establish lowlevel diplomatic ties he 
withdrew it when vietnam suspended cooperation for several months 
on the search for missing americans 
no serious public official in this country will ever tell the 
families of the americans still missing in vietnam that we 
intend to proceed with the improvement of relations absent any 
realistic expectation of vietnamese cooperation in determining the 
fate of their fathers husbands sons and brothers he said in a 
recent washington post opinion piece 
vietnam in recent months has been providing more information on 
us mias and has been allowing vietnamese formerly associated 
with americans or fathered by us servicemen to leave for the 
united states 
yet secretary of state james a baker iii said several months 
ago that the issue of missing american servicemen must first be 
resolved before official ties can be forged 
the administration says progress has been made in accounting for 
the estimated 1700 americans missing in vietnam another in a 
series of us official delegations of officials and forensic 
experts is heading for hanoi later this month

abortion rights advocates conceded sunday they 
have little chance of overriding president bushs veto of a bill 
allowing medicaid to pay for abortions for victims of rape or 
incest 
but prochoice lawmakers and lobbyists said they still will put 
up a fight to override bushs veto on the 157 billion laborhealth 
and human services appropriations bill 
the outlook for an override is not good said marcy wilder 
a staff attorney for the national abortion rights action league a 
main prochoice lobbying group 
while the senate approved the spending bill including 
relaxation of the medicaid abortion restrictions last thursday by 
a 6731 vote the house vote a week earlier was 216206 far short 
of the twothirds that would be needed to override the veto 
bush is also threatening to veto two other pending pieces of 
legislation over abortionrelated issues a district of columbia 
appropriations bill allowing medicaid to pay for all abortions for 
poor women in the nations capital and a foreign operations bill 
that would lift restrictions on funding united nations family 
planning programs 
sen bob packwood rore a longtime leader of prochoice 
forces in congress acknowledged the prospects for an override in 
the house now are slim but he suggested that congress keep passing 
the same appropriations bill 
if republicans lose next months gubernatorial races to 
prochoice democrats in virginia and new jersey packwood 
predicted you may see a chance in the house to override a bush 
abortion veto the second or third time around 
packwood interviewed on cable news networks evans amp novak 
show said republican lawmakers are shifting under pressure from 
constituents toward a more prochoice stance 
the people in my party are talking about this issue and are 
frightened to death of it and they suddenly see that the tide has 
turned said packwood 
bush vetoed the measure saturday at camp david the presidential 
retreat in maryland where he spent the weekend after returning from 
fridays tour of earthquake damage in northern california 
bush said he was unwilling to permit federal funding of 
abortions other than those in which the life of the mother would 
be endangered if the fetus were carried to term that is how the 
medicaid law has stood since 1981 he noted 
bush personally believes rape and incest victims should have a 
legal right to obtain an abortion but he is unwilling to pay for 
the procedure for poor women 
douglas johnson legislative director of the national right to 
life committee praised bush for keeping his campaign commitment on 
abortion he said his group the leading antiabortion lobby is 
urging its members to contact members of the house to uphold the 
veto 
rep pat schroeder dcolo a prochoice lawmaker said 
clearly well try to override clearly thats probably not 
going to happen so he wins 
she said that vetoing the laborhhs bill threatens funding for 
essential health and human services programs 
his veto is stopping the government this is massive its 
clear hes playing politics to the end she said

christian lacroix woke up the fashion crowd sunday 
with his show of bright peppy clothes in readytowear and 
luxe versions for the 1990 summer season 
both lines showed some leggy looks long pants and lacroixs 
curvy cuts luxe was simply richer than readytowear and will 
cost a few thousand dollars more per outfit 
in both shows he included some of his oval skirts and fitted 
jackets plus a few of his famous fichu collars and trapezeline 
coats and dresses pants ranged from full and cropped to 
cigarette slim under tunic tops and dressy jackets 
the slightly simplified sportier readytowear lines led off 
with a blue drawstring parka over narrow madras plaid pants and 
color burst out from there on often with lacroixs ebullient 
mixes of flowers checks plaids 
it was a sunny summery collection of high spirits by the young 
creator from the sunny south of france showing sunhats and 
beachwear galore this time 
while many designers were bringing out lots of rusty even muddy 
autumn colors lacroix went out for a fresh palette of pinks reds 
violet pistachio and chartreuse in clothes that often came out 
looking younger than springtime 
his fitted suits of huge houndstooth checks came out in 
turquoise or chartreuse and black for a striking city look but the 
daisyprinted floral provencal cotton jackets paired with full 
short skirts in a different print were happygolucky lacroix at 
his best 
he showed a lot of leg in the bloomer shorts or skirts and 
bright pistachio or pink linen jackets with big jeweled collars 
lacroixs simplest line involved delicate mixes of pastel 
twinsets and chocolate brown pleated skirts or straight pants the 
pearlbuttoned knit toppers had puffed organza sleeves rimmed in 
gold 
while some of the brightest patchworks with heart and star print 
motifs came out in trapezeline dresses much of the collection was 
based on sexy bustier tops especially in multicolored lame brocade 
cocktail dresses 
the luxe clothes were sometimes dolled up with so much lace 
and glitz that the chic was nearly hidden but there were also some 
fabulous clothes in this nearcouture line 
some of the sweetness nearly got out of hand in this show with 
the sequined pink or blue taffetaruffled laceedged wraparound 
dresses as the loudspeaker warbled may time by jeannette 
macdonald 
even the tiger ladies in their chiffon animal prints looked 
more innocent than wild though one was a clinging ruffled and 
gathered number to outline an hourglass figure 
the chiffons ranged from nice navy numbers with godet 
flounces at the kneelength hem for dancing to some wonderful pink 
and raspberry flower prints draped with a big scarf fastened with 
an outsized rose at the shoulder 
black lace navy pleated chiffon and sparkling embroidery on 
short dresses and pajama outfits topped by tunics ended up this 
show that offered the ultimate in dressy summer wear 
luxury in a totally different vein was laid on with heavier 
brush strokes by romeo gigli in his second paris show 
currently the darling of the fashion world gigli 39 prefers 
the madcap paris fashion whirl to his native italy for showing his 
clothes after last springs hit show this second offering was 
played to a packed enthusiastic house 
it was a case where the clothes wore the women models minced 
down the runway looking barely able to walk constrained by silky 
gossamer shoulder wraps puffed tutuskirt effects over lean silk 
trousers worn with colored tights and flat sandals 
the outfits were treated as artwork they ranged between 
byzantine and oriental opulence with the most dazzling iridescent 
silks lace velvet goldthreaded sheer fabrics often in the burnt 
colors of autumn 
it was like looking at a series of paintings rather than clothes 
to wear to a party full stiffened tentlike shortie coats over 
figured pants had the look of hieratic characters in a byzantine 
mosaic especially with the flowing pearled earrings bigger than 
chandeliers draped over the shoulders 
but gigli can cut and his slim iridescent or metallic lame silk 
tailcoats looked wonderful over slim pants 
martine sitbon brought out dozens of sailor suits a couple of 
batman types in body stockings and capes and a few cowgirl styles 
at the opposite end of the spectrum from gigli sitbon showed peppy 
clothes that were mainly for the young 
in tones of navy or rust linen the seagoing set was decked out 
in vests and middy collars or battle jackets with striped shirts up 
top below decks it was short corsair or long bellbottomed 
trousers and a perky shortsjumpsuit for good measure

a policeman goes on trial monday in the deaths of 
two blacks as miami moves to head off a repeat of the race riots 
touched off by the case 
acquittals of police officers in the deaths of blacks sparked 
violence here in 1980 and 1984 the impeachment conviction friday 
of a popular black federal judge a heated local election campaign 
and the drug war could raise tensions 
william lozano 32 is charged with manslaughter in the jan 16 
shooting of motorcyclist clement lloyd and the death of passenger 
allan blanchard in the ensuing crash lozano said lloyd tried to 
run him over and he fired in selfdefense 
the deaths touched off three days of rioting that claimed two 
lives and caused 1 million damage as miami was getting ready to be 
host of the super bowl 
lozano a native colombian whose brother is also on the force 
is viewed by many in the areas prominent hispanic community as a 
political scapegoat being sacrificed to ease racial tensions they 
have raised thousands for his defense 
to blacks lozano is proof that white police officers put lower 
value on a black life 
defense attorney roy black says fear of a riot prompted him to 
ask circuit judge joseph farina to move the trial a request farina 
is expected to take up monday 
the city plans to have all 1100 police officers on call at the 
end of the trial expected to last three weeks it also has ordered 
700 gas masks and has two armored personnel carriers and national 
guard military equipment available 
a community relations board has been advising residents on how 
to avoid violence and a rumorcontrol hotline was set up 
black plans to tell jurors that lloyd was fleeing from another 
officer who had tried to pull him over and that the motorcyclist 
whose neck and wrists were laden with gold and diamonds was a drug 
dealer with good reason to flee 
when killed he had a suspended license 1500 cash and a bag 
of marijuana in his pocket cocaine alcohol and marijuana in his 
blood and an arrest record for marijuana possession according to 
authorities 
assistant state attorney john hogan counters that lloyds 
troubles are irrelevant and that lozano shot without justification 
the shooting came just hours after thousands of blacks paraded 
in memory of martin luther king jr

the blackboard in front of the student 
union lists mondays main volunteer need help in transporting 
injured and displaced students around campus in golf carts 
a sign nearby calls for cash donations to the red cross tables 
that usually have political fliers or information on campus events 
now are covered with emergency numbers and details of destruction 
a few weeks after the start of the school year stanford 
university students are getting a lesson in coping with an 
earthquake 
twentysix of stanfords 240 buildings including the beautiful 
memorial church in the heart of the campus were rendered unsafe 
after the oct 17 quak and 34 more were restricted to limited 
access as repair estimates soared to 200 million 
more than 1600 of the 13000 students were displaced the night 
of the quake including 500 who remain homeless because of the 
closing of old fraternity and club houses 
one of the biggest concerns besides cracked walls and damaged 
equipment and furnishings is asbestos exposure from the quake 
the landmark hoover tower home of the hoover institution and 
repository for millions of artifacts and the main building of the 
graduate school of business have been closed pending asbestos 
inspections 
considerable academic anxiety has struck the campus 
university president donald kennedy said most students are still 
unable to enter the library many have been unable to retrieve 
books and notes from buildings that have been closed many have 
been unable to obtain informations on classes and still others 
have not been able to reenter their residences 
student volunteers worked through the weekend picking up 
crumpled books metal and plaster at the law library others moved 
the organ from the church picked through debris in laboratories 
and swept up classrooms and dorms 
the damage is not nearly as bad as in 1906 when the campus was 
virtually destroyed by the great earthquake but last weeks quake 
is taking its toll on students 
the memorial church with its mosaic tiles and stained glass 
windows was partially destroyed in 1906 four years after its 
completion and restored in 1913 
the major damage this time was to the arch near the altar the 
keystone the central block in an archway was more than a 
halfinch off center and may have to be rebuilt 
in general stanford has done a good job of risk management 
said haresh shah chairman of the civil engineering department and 
one of the worlds leading earthquake experts the structural 
seismic work that we have been doing the past five years has really 
paid off 
stanford began a program in 1986 to assess earthquake risk in 
older buildings and add seismic bracing just weeks after 
completing recommended bracing projects in the roble hall dorm and 
the old pavilion both buildings came through unscathed 
so did the landmark lou henry hoover house home to university 
president kennedy although there was heavy damage to the contents 
scientific laboraties also were largely undamaged as was the 
medical center and the stanford linear accelerator center 
stanford will have to foot the cost of the bill itself out of 
its endowment loans and other funds the university had earthquake 
insurance from 1980 to 1985 but then the insuring companies 
canceled the policy 
the university decided to become selfinsured and as of aug 31 
it had 34 million in an earthquake reserve and 36 million in a 
property reserve

aptos creek murmured 
softly sunday over the epicenter of northern californias deadly 
earthquake its serenity belying the ruined towns broken highways 
and bridges and shattered lives for miles around 
while crews at the collapsed nimitz freeway in oakland continued 
working amid twisted steel and crumbled concrete at a scene of 
almost unimaginable horror a few uprooted trees and minor 
landslides were the only visible signs of the quake at its 
epicenter here in the forest of nisene marks state park 
jays and squirrels chattered from the canopy of branches high 
over head a rockslide blocked the aptos creek fire road above the 
old loma prieta lumber mill 
farther up the mountain a few mossy trees had toppled across 
the trail leading to the headwaters of aptos creek tentatively 
identified by geologists as the center of the 69magnitude temblor 
for geologists the epicenter represents more symbol than 
significance said robert uhrhammer a research seismologist at the 
university of california seismographic station at berkeley 
the epicenter is just a point on the surface immediately above 
the point where the rupture first started uhrhammer said 
geologists believe that point is about 11 miles below aptos creek 
for major quakes however the point of the rupture breaks into 
a fracture many miles long that releases tremendous amounts of 
energy as geological plates slip and slide violently past each 
other 
the forest of nisene marks state park is a lush maze of ridges 
and canyons formed by the earths twists and contortions along the 
faults that run diagonally across it 
the park was created in 1963 when two brothers of a locally 
prominent farming family aided by the nature conservancy donated 
9600 acres to the state in memory of their mother nisene with 
the stipulation that it never be developed 
most of the park was clearcut in a 40year logging frenzy that 
ended in the 1920s said park ranger gerald e waggoner loggers 
cut 140 million board feet of lumber from the area 
while isolated stands of towering redwoods thousands of years 
old remain in spots the santa cruz mountains supplied much of the 
timber used to rebuild san francisco after the great quake of 1906 
at the turn of the century the loma preita mill was the largest 
in santa cruz county employing 600 workers in the summers 
waggoner said 
it was a company town he said 
the oncedenuded forest was donated to the state in 1963 and 
red alder bigleaf maples tan bark oak and secondgeneration 
redwoods are making comebacks 
this is a hidden forest here said steve shaw an aptos 
resident who paused from his jog along the fire road its not 
marked on any highways and most of us locals treat it like our own 
preserve 
other runners passing in the forest exchanged quakerelated 
pleasantries 
did your house make out ok one voice asked echoing among 
the trees 
oh we lost a chimney and a plateglass window another 
voice replied but we did pretty well

leaders of the 49nation 
commonwealth on sunday gave south africa six months to deliver on 
reform promises or face new reprisals and they called for tighter 
financial pressure immediately britain alone dissented 
british prime minister margaret thatcher rejecting key 
provisions of the commonwealth summit declaration on south africa 
charged that us and commonwealth embargoes have strengthened 
white extremism in south africa 
but she went along with a stipulation that current trade 
embargoes remain for the time being 
in its declaration the organization of britain and its former 
colonies held off on seeking new embargoes for at least six months 
britain objected to provisions setting up a new body to 
scrutinize south africas financial links and declaring that a 
foreign ministers committee which monitors sanctions and suggests 
new ones will meet in six months 
the 12page declaration gave muted acknowledgment of reform 
moves by south africas new president fw de klerk who has said 
the black majority could have a role in politics in five years 
it said there was a possibility that significant changes in 
approach on the part of the south african regime may yet prove 
to be within reach 
the declaration was issued sunday after final approval by the 
commonwealth leaders at a weekend retreat at langkawi island 210 
miles northwest of here 
in a separate statement sunday mrs thatcher said there 
seems to be a clear correlation between the imposition of 
additional sanctions by the us congress and the commonwealth and 
the strength of extreme rightwing parties in south africa utterly 
opposed to change 
the statement took other countries by surprise a senior 
commonwealth official requesting anonymity called it 
despicable 
british foreign secretary john major who was on the committee 
that drew up the final commonwealth declaration said it showed a 
novel recognition by the commonwealth that change is beginning in 
south africa and that sanctions should not be punitive 
tanzanian foreign minister ben wmkapa called majors 
interpretation was laughable 
this declaration expresses our judgment that south africa has 
undertaken no fundamental changes wmpaka said in an interview 
whats he crowing about 
canadian external affairs secretary joe clark head of the 
committee said nobody is buying that de klerk has shifted away 
from apartheid the system that denies the black majority the vote 
the declaration noted that de klerk had accepted a degree of 
peaceful political activity by the black majority and on the eve of 
this meeting had released from prison eight political leaders 
in parts of the declaration the tone was milder than that of 
previous commonwealth pronouncements on south africa and it 
stressed the need for peaceful change 
the declaration incorporated an australian proposal that the 
commonwealth call on international banks to restrict south african 
trade credits to a maximum of 90 days and urge governments to make 
it more difficult for south africa to get credits 
it also said that a un arms embargo should be intensified 
current commonwealth embargoes consist of 11 voluntary 
sanctions including a ban on air links drawn up in 1986 
britain refuses to impose most of the commonwealth embargoes 
black african states which depend economically on south africa do 
not impose them 
the sanctions fall well short of those imposed by the united 
states

more than 500 east germans gathered sunday in a 
leipzig concert hall to talk with local communist party officials 
about reforms under consideration in the wake of last weeks 
leadership change 
lutheran church sources in leipzig said another prodemocracy 
protest was planned monday night to keep up pressure on the 
government to implement reforms 
church sources in east berlin said religious leaders in dresden 
have compiled a report detailing alleged incidents of police 
brutality during demonstrations two weeks ago 
the report lists 100 allegations of police beatings and other 
mistreatment of protesters the sources said it also quotes 
witnesses as saying many of those detained were stripsearched and 
beaten with clubs 
west germanys zdf television network quoted witnesses as saying 
one woman was struck in the stomach three times despite cries to 
police captors that she was pregnant 
east germanys official news agency adn said the meeting sunday 
at leipzigs gewandhaus concert house included citizens from all 
parts of society prominent local communist party officials 
artists students scientists and workers 
no details of the discussions were provided by the news agency 
other than that they covered topical problems in east germany 
the news agency said the orchestras conductor kurt masur was 
among the participants and he suggested such meetings be held 
every sunday to get the public involved in solving social problems 
leipzigs communist officials have pledged to start talking to 
the people following massive prodemocracy protests the largest 
since a 1953 workers uprising that brought tens of thousands into 
the streets of leipzig this month 
in an even more unusual gesture toward dialogue east berlin 
party chief guenter schabowski and mayor erhard krack engaged in a 
heated debate with pedestrians saturday after an unauthorized march 
by activists through the streets of east berlin 
that discussion touched on travel restrictions and public 
skepticism about the sincerity of the newly touted reforms it was 
broadcast less than two hours later on staterun televisions 
nightly news program 
much of the change has occurred since wednesday when 
77yearold leader erich honecker was ousted and replaced by his 
protege egon krenz 52 
adn reported sunday that politburo member harry tisch head of 
east germanys labor federation has called for more independence 
for the nations labor unions as a step toward reform 
i think it is better if the unions find and represent their 
own positions tisch said apparently refering to the labor 
movements traditional advocacy of party policies 
also sunday adn reported that one of east germanys most 
prominent actresses kaethe reichel held a reading in east 
berlins deutsches theater against violence and misuse of authority 
at the end of the presentation ms reichel also read a 
statement signed by east berlin actors and actresses demanding a 
complete investigation into allegations of police brutality during 
prodemocracy demonstrations 
at least 1000 people were reported to have been arrested 
earlier this month when mass demonstrations broke out in leipzig 
surrounding the 40th anniversary of east german statehood oct 7 
activists have complained that police used brute force to break 
up some of the peaceful marches and authorities have recently 
promised to look into those allegations

mezzosoprano marilyn horne sang a marvelous 
rosina in rossinis the barber of seville on saturday proving 
shes doing what she has said she wants quit while shes ahead 
miss horne is singing the first five performances of barber 
at the metropolitan opera this season her farewell to that opera 
she first sang rosina 27 years ago in san francisco and has 
decided to drop certain operas from her repertoire 
saturday afternoons barber was unusually amusing its easy 
to make the action too broad but this cast which kicked up its 
heels a bit more than most just added jollity and didnt go too 
far 
paata burchuladze the russian bass sings with effortless 
richness even on the lowest notes in the ensemble in which hes 
front and center he took charge of the stage with comic assurance 
but without trying to steal the show 
tenor michael cousins made a metropolitan opera debut as count 
almaviva because stanford olsen was sick cousins began with some 
strain in coloratura passages but that subsided and the impression 
he left is of a pleasing tone it isnt a beautiful voice but it 
was a met debut to note his strongest suit is his stage demeanor 
he acted the role to perfection 
two outstanding singers of the afternoon were baritones and 
father and son the son gino quilico was figaro he sings the 
role with a more finely focused tone than many and in act 1 he 
presented a rather stiff figaro but in act 2 he loosened up and 
added to the fun one hopes that he and his father enjoyed the 
shaving scene as much as the audience did 
louis quilico was rosinas guardian he sang a marvelous 
overstuffed but foxy gent 
the orchestral music was ebullient under the baton of julius 
rudel 
baritone motti kaston who has been in the metropolitan opera 
young artist program made a favorable impression in his met debut 
as almavivas servant 
the rossina traditionally can choose the aria to sing in the 
lesson scene miss horne chose la mia pacela mia calma which 
probably hasnt been sung since rossinis time it was first sung 
in bologne in 1816 after the operas premiere in rome earlier that 
year 
it showcased the voice of this mezzosoprano who will be greatly 
missed by connoisseurs of barber

a soviet newspaper said sunday that economic and 
social problems piled up for years in east germany under erich 
honecker despite glowing official press reports of the situation 
there 
in an article titled gdr fresh air of renewal 
correspondent v nikitin of the labor daily trud wrote the first 
soviet press report on east germany that admits earlier reports 
glossed over the soviet allys problems 
although there had been hints of kremlin dissatisfaction before 
the trud article contained the strongest criticism in the east 
german and soviet media of honeckers policies 
the mass media seemed to shut themselves off from reality and 
kept on reporting about achievements and overfulfilled plans 
nikitin wrote from east berlin 
our colleagues from the german democratic republic were 
forced as once we were to write about not what existed but about 
what one wanted to exist on some days for example one could see 
dozens of pictures showing former first secretary honecker in the 
official party daily nikitin said 
while the whitewashing continued the correspondent wrote east 
germanys economic development slowed because of too much 
centralized control and problems in economic social and public 
spheres were piling up in the republic 
honecker 77 stepped down wednesday as communist party leader 
after 18 years in power trud noted that as soon as his 
replacement egon krenz took office news organizations became 
more frank in reporting the countrys problems 
honecker cited health reasons for resigning but widespread 
dissatisfaction with his authoritarian government which has led 
about 55000 east germans to flee west in recent weeks had 
increased pressure for a change 
most soviet press reports have criticized the fleeing east 
germans but nikitin was sympathetic 
the republic has suffered a big moral and material blow from 
the last wave of illegal emigration of tens of thousands of gdr 
citizens to west germany he wrote mainly young people have 
left the country skilled workers scientific and technical 
intellectuals medical workers and they ran away not from 
poverty 
he suggested many people left because of wage leveling a lack 
of dialogue with the leadership and travel restrictions 
people also were upset that they were not given information 
about reforms in the soviet union the trud correspondent wrote 
people were informed only about earthquakes and catastrophes 
interethnic clashes tea and sugar rationing it seemed that 
somebody did not want to say the truth about reforms in the 
soviet economy democratization in public and political life 
about formation of a real peoples parliament about other profound 
reforms in our country with all its problems sufferings and 
hopes

the man who would be king could find great 
bargains in dallas over the weekend 
the shakespeare festival of dallas held a rummage sale saturday 
and sunday to get rid of many unneeded costumes and props 
a purple kings robe was going for 85 and upperbody armor was 
priced at 50 body leotards decorated with leaves and flowers 
worn by wood sprites in a production of a midsummer nights 
dream were priced at 10 apiece 
i came in here not thinking i was going to buy anything 
said sally nelson i bought the crown not only for myself but for 
my two young nieces i always enjoyed playing dressup when i was a 
kid and pretending i was a princess 
managing director dejon malley hill said the handmade costumes 
and other props from 15 years of festival productions were 
expendable because the companys plays are never presented in the 
same way 
the sale which included some more contemporary castoffs such as 
womens dresses a hubcap and a talking teddy bear raised about 
2800 in its first day 
sale proceeds will benefit the festival which sustained a heavy 
financial loss when its stage was blown apart by a storm last 
summer the 1990 season will offer productions of pericles

days after mikhail gorbachev called for his ouster 
from the communist party parliamentarian yuri afanasyev has come 
under attack from the staterun press in a campaign reminiscent of 
those waged against dissidents before the glasnost era 
the attacks which came nearly every day last week have 
centered on the maverick historians harsh criticism of the party 
and his siding with japan in a territorial dispute with the kremlin 
such repeated harsh criticism of political activists by name is 
rare under glasnost gorbachevs policy of openness and appears a 
throwback to the rule of president leonid i brezhnev in those 
days such attacks often preceded the jailing or exiling of 
dissidents 
afanasyev 55 is head of the moscow state historical archives 
institute and a member of the congress of peoples deputies 
in an oct 13 meeting gorbachev reportedly accused afanasyev 
and two economists of joining with communist legislator boris n 
yeltsin to form a fascist clique striving for power 
they men belong to a parliamentary opposition group informed 
soviet sources said gorbachev told the meeting afanasyev should be 
thrown out of the communist party 
the historian was traveling out of the country sunday and 
unavailable for comment 
afanasyev was well known to intellectuals nationwide for his 
participation in memorial a group trying to build a monument 
and research center in memory of the victims of dictator josef 
stalins terror 
he gained wider fame in a nationally televised speech in may to 
the congress of peoples deputies 
with gorbachev looking on afanasyev said the soviet leader had 
either listened to or influenced an aggressively obedient 
majority in the congress to elect a brezhneviststalinist 
supreme soviet the supreme soviet is the fulltime legislature 
the staterun press and other deputies criticized afanasyev for 
his remarks at the time 
on tuesday the russian party daily sovietsksya rossiya said 
afanasyev believes the official ideology of marxismleninism is 
outmoded it asked isnt it more honest for him to leave the 
party 
on the same day the central party daily pravda quoted afanasyev 
as telling a leningrad meeting that the party has no authority and 
in 70 years of power has led the country nowhere 
pravda said afanasyev who appears frequently at rallies of 
unofficial political groups and speaks in a booming baritone never 
backs up his charges and has turned from historian to priest 
pravda took the campaign a step further friday with an article 
titled irresponsibility referring to comments afanasyev made 
two days earlier in tokyo at a symposium on gorbachevs reform 
program 
according to the asahi evening news afanasyev told the meeting 
he feels the soviet union should return four islands japan wants 
because the dispute over them dating back to world war ii is 
preventing normal relations 
the soviets occupied the kuril islands north of hokkaido after 
the end of fighting in 1945 and have refused to return them 
pravda reported afanasyevs remarks but did not point out that 
he said they were his personal opinion 
it told soviet readers the japanese have found among our 
countrymen an open and extremely active ally in the dispute 
the capitals local party newspaper moskovskaya pravda joined 
the campaign saturday reprinting an article from afanasyevs home 
district newspaper accusing him of trying to discredit the party

congress will spend much of this week spending 
money including billions for earthquake disaster relief while 
also trying not to lose sight of the need for reducing the federal 
deficit 
californias house delegation planned to seek an aid package 
monday at a meeting of the house appropriations committee and 
speaker thomas s foley said he expected congress to act quickly 
congress has asked the presidents budget office for an official 
cost estimate by monday morning but administration officials said 
sunday more time may be required as the damage estimates from the 
san francisco bay area continue to escalate 
its an evolving situation transportation secretary 
samuel skinner said sunday on cbstvs face the nation program 
i dont think we want to jump to a number 
foley on friday said he expected that washington would have to 
provide 25 billion in earthquake relief california lt gov leo 
mccarthy on sunday put the needed federal aid at 33 billion sen 
alan cranston dcalif raised it to 35 billion and sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny said he expects the figure to rise to 5 
billion before its all over 
im sure well reach closure on what is a realistic number 
skinner said 
moynihan interviewed on nbcs meet the press program said 
he expected most of the earthquake aid to come from the 12 billion 
accumulated in the federal highway trust fund 
but he said president bush should use the earthquake and 
hurricane hugo last month to call for a massive new public works 
program financed by an increase in gasoline taxes to repair the 
nations infrastructure 
if ever there was a moment to talk about increasing the 
gasoline tax now is the moment when people have those pictures of 
the nimitz expressway still in their minds moynihan said 
lets get this country fixed up 
the initial disaster assistance was expected to become part of a 
stopgap spending bill required because congress and the president 
have failed to enact the annual appropriations for fiscal 1990 
which began oct 1 the government has been operating on an interim 
spending bill which expires oct 25 
full house action on the bill was expected tuesday with speedy 
senate consideration to follow 
the costly disasters struck while congress has been looking for 
ways to reduce the federal deficit a housesenate conference 
committee is trying to settle money disputes between the two 
chambers including president bushs demand for a cut in the 
capital gains tax rate 
the house has approved a cut as part of its antideficit 
package but opponents in the senate including democratic leader 
george mitchell kept it off the senate version 
mitchell said friday he didnt think the senate would pass a 
capital gains cut this year and he accused those who are pushing 
it of being irresponsible 
the continuing deficit problem will soon force congress to 
approve bushs request for another increase in the national debt 
but foley said lawmakers had to put aside their concern for the 
deficit when it came to providing money for the disaster victims 
it would be very unfair to affected areas to say well we 
cant meet these obligations because we have a budget crunch 
foley said we have to respond 
the talks on the deficitreduction bill were also a victim of 
the earthquake as key lawmakers had to turn their attention to the 
disaster house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
represents a district including the center of the quake 
the budget talks were expected to resume this week aside from 
the capital gains fight lawmakers were trying to decide how to 
handle such touchy issues as repealing the medicare catastrophic 
health plan and expanding federal child care subsidies 
bushs veto saturday night of a 1567 billion appropriation 
bill for the labor and health and human services departments 
because it liberalizes federal spending on abortion also sends that 
issue back to congress 
the senate planed to debate monday a bill setting up a 
commission to study the sevenmonth old strike by machinists 
pilots and flight attendants against eastern airlines 
the bill is a watereddown version of a measure introduced 
shortly after the strike began in march and opposed by president 
bush that would have established an emergency board empowered to 
recommend a way to end the walkout 
both the house and senate plan to work on some of the regular 
fiscal 1990 spending bills covering a wide range of programs 
including agriculture justice and transportation 
the transportation bill as passed by the senate includes 11 
billion above what the white house recommended for antidrug 
programs and the two chambers are working on a final version 
the house and senate negotiators have already agreed on another 
issue on the bill a ban on smoking on virtually all domestic 
flights

the shutdown of a shelter for earthquake 
victims to make room for a convention of plastic surgeons has 
angered some of the displaced and brought an angry defense by mayor 
art agnos 
most of the 1000 people housed in the red cross shelter at the 
huge moscone convention center were moved sunday to the presidio 
army base and to a navy transport ship allowing time to prepare 
for the american society of reconstructive and plastic surgeons 
convention oct 30 city officials said 
the relocation angered residents of the tenderloin district 
where hundreds of elderly and impoverished people were evicted from 
damaged transient hotels after tuesdays devastating 69magnitude 
quake 
they should have the plastic surgeons postpone it for a week 
and let people get over this earthquake im still shaking from 
this quake said keith holyfield 28 an unemployed man in a 
stained shirt and tattered greenandyellow oakland athletics cap 
who waited outside the moscone center on sunday 
the center is within walking distance of the tenderloins cheap 
cafes the presidio and the uss peleliu at pier 30 are miles 
away closer to the swanky cliff house restaurant and fishermans 
wharf 
the citys chronically homeless the estimated 6000 who live 
yearround in doorways and warm themselves over garbage can fires 
said it took a disaster for the city to open an emergency shelter 
why does it take an earthquake for a bum to get a cup of 
coffee said harvey roberts an unemployed accountant who has 
slept at moscone center since the quake 
the shelter its a luxury said holyfield who slept on the 
street until the quake raised his standard of living by making a 
cot available in the convention hall ballroom 
mayor art agnos disputed the accusations that the city does not 
normally provide adequate shelter he said san francisco already 
pays for 2900 hotel rooms a night and that the city needs 
convention and tourist revenue to finance a new 17 million program 
to create 3000 additional dwellings for the poor within a year 
this industry is the financial life blood of the city we 
wont have the money to pay for the permanent solutions agnos 
said sunday as he headed into a quakedamaged city hall closed to 
the public 
the hotel tax brings in 80 million a year the tourist industry 
is the citys largest single revenue source and employer said rudy 
nothenberg san franciscos chief administrative officer 
red cross officials at the moscone shelter where 1043 people 
slept saturday night said the homeless had to be moved because the 
center has no showers or working kitchen 
it is a hot political issue i cant fathom it said dave 
glaubinger evening manager it doesnt really conform to red 
cross standards for a shelter 
the rev cecil williams pastor of glide memorial church in the 
tenderloin where volunteers have served 5000 meals a day since 
the quake denounced the proposed move in his sunday sermon 
i know that in a stress group that began friday the most 
stressful thing they taked about was that they were going to be 
removed williams said in an interview before the service 
according to williams survey of hotels 1500 to 2000 elderly 
disabled and poor residents were evicted when the city closed at 
least five large transient hotels and parts of others after the 
quake many of these were the same hotels where city government 
provided nighttime shelter to the homeless 
eileen maloney a spokeswoman for agnos noted the different 
treatment accorded tenderloin homeless and the 1000 people who 
until sunday were housed at the marina middle school in the 
affluent district devastated by the quake 
in one practice dubbed red tagging citizens offered 
showers and beds to people whod lost homes in the quake as long 
as they could prove homelessness by showing a red tag the official 
notice allowing them to search their marina apartments 
what it means is that theyre from the marina said maloney 
visibly angry over the apparently discriminatory practice 
williams made a public appeal for every church in san francisco 
to take in 25 people mainly mothers and children 
its time to rock the mother and the child in our bosom he 
said 
ann burns a red cross official said buses began moving people 
from the moscone center to the presidio at midday they expected 
500 to 1000 people to be relocated there 
they will be housed in two buildings one for the general 
population the second for families and the elderly 
single men will be housed on the ship

the earthquakecrippled bay area braced for 
a gigantic traffic jam monday and officials appealed for commuters 
to use car pools trains or ferries switch their hours or work 
from home 
because of the stage of emergency if we find ourselves 
with a singleperson vehicle with any alternative then theyre 
doing an antisocial act said rod diridon chairman of the 
metropolitan transportation commission a regionwide planning 
agency 
some 3 million people in the ninecounty bay area commute daily 
on an average weekday according to the commission which predicts 2 
million of those will probably encounter delays of some kind 
monday is the first real business day for many thousands since the 
quake 
at least 65000 people who normally enter san francisco over the 
bay bridge at rush hour in cars or buses must find other routes 
because the artery was severed 
the bay area rapid transit system which runs trains in a tube 
beneath the bay should pick up 35000 of them and ferries can 
handle 10000 that leaves 20000 to try car and van pools across 
the san mateo bridge to the south or the richmondsan rafael bridge 
in the north 
we expect its going to be extremely crowded said bart 
spokesman sy mouber on sunday i would say that its going to be 
a jamup probably the system which normally shuts from midnight 
to 6 am will run 24 hours 
transit officials urged businesses to implement flex hours 
in which an employee can report to work at staggered times and 
avoid commute rushhours they asked anyone able to work from home 
to do that 
the devastation to northern californias roadways was 
tremendous and longterm 
the eightmilelong bay bridge will be closed at least a month 
while a 50foot section is replaced last tuesdays 69magnitude 
earthquake also collapsed a 125mile section of interstate 880 
the nimitz freeway killing dozens of people it had carried 
170000 vehicles per day but will now likely be closed for years 
in san francisco the embarcadero freeway suffered severe 
damage the 12mile elevated freeway which connects downtown with 
north beach and fishermans wharf will be closed for months so 
will a fivemile stretch of interstate 280 in san francisco from 
us highway 101 to sixth street 
in santa cruz near the quakes epicenter state highway 17 was 
closed because of landslides and mudslides that important link for 
20000 people who commute to work in the silicon valley will be 
closed to general traffic for an undetermined time although one 
line will be opened for buses and emergency vehicles 
ferry service around the bay has been expanded with added stops 
at the richmond container terminal and jack london square in 
oakland 
three ferries capable of carrying at least 250 people each 
were supposed to arrive from puget sound in washington by 
wednesday but on sunday those boats were still docked because of 
inclement weather 
a ferry boat from san diego and 20 small navy vessels are 
available to help transport commuters later in the week

eight political prisoners freed from prison last week said sunday 
that president fw de klerk must wash the blood from his hands 
before he will speak to him

called on de klerk to free all political prisoners and legalize 
opposition parties

to listen to mpetha a onelegged partially blind diabetic who 
remained seated throughout his speech 
i cant speak to de klerk his hands are bloody the african

must first wash the blood off his hands and feet 
mpetha was the first of the freed prisoners to appear at a 
public rally he was sentenced to five years in prison in 1985 
after being convicted of terrorism 
today is not just another day not just aother rally it is a 
rally of the anc and we have come to welcome the anc leadership 
local civil rights lawyer bulelani ncuka told the crowd 
attorney dulla omar regional chairman of the banned united 
democratic front antiapartheid movement said the purpose of the 
rally was to unban the anc as well as to welcome mpetha 
the anc the main guerrilla group fighting the whiteled 
government was banned in 1960 
mpetha who says he still retains the title of president of the 
anc in the western cape province was flanked on the platform by 
six elderly anc men who were brought to the rally in an ambulance 
mpetha said a symbolic cleansing for de klerk would involve 
releasing all political prisoners allowing exiles to return safely 
to the country and legalizing the anc 
when he wipes his hands this will be a sign mpetha said 
he also said that anc leader nelson mandela must be freed to 
address the people 
then only will i accompany comrade nelson mandela and anc 
president in exile comrade oliver tambo to talks with the 
government mpetha said to resounding cheers 
all the speakers stressed that the release of the eight 
prisoners last week did not mean an end to the ancs military 
activity and they called on the government to cease violence 
through the army and police 
de klerk had said in a speech saturday that all organizations 
could be part of negotiations for an end to apartheid and the 
inclusion of the black majority in national government if they were 
committed to peaceful solutions

helicopter that hovered briefly

republican j marshall coleman won the 
endorsement sunday of the richmond timesdispatch a week after his 
opponent democrat l douglas wilder got the nod from the 
washington post 
wilder the states 58yearold lieutenant governor is seeking 
to become the first elected black governor in the country 
in an editorial the timesdispatch said it backed coleman 47 
based on his impressive experience as a state legislator and as 
virginias attorney general on the concept of government he 
embraces and on the views he has expressed on vital issues during 
this campaign 
among other reasons the newspaper said coleman would strengthen 
local authority over education would deal sternly with drug lords 
and other criminals and would hold the line on taxes 
the editorial also said the election of coleman would protect 
the state from a particularly nasty kind of political tyranny 
when the general assembly which has a democratic majority redraws 
the states legislative boundaries in 1991 
the newspaper also endorsed colemans gop ticketmates edwina p 
eddy dalton for lieutenant governor and joseph b benedetti for 
attorney general 
in its endorsement of wilder last sunday the post made no 
comment on others on the ticket wilders running mates are donald 
beyer for lieutenant governor and incumbent attorney general mary

tuesday but vincent and agnos said the bay areas priorities were 
much more important than the world series

repairs to the san franciscooakland bay 
bridge began sunday when a huge crane hefted half of the damaged 
upper deck section off the lower roadway and smoothly lowered it 
onto a barge 200 feet below 
but todays task just the beginning of work expected to take at 
least a month offers no relief to the gridlock expected when the 
work week resumes monday 
it was unclear whether officials would try to remove a second 
100ton section of collapsed roadway sunday or wait until monday 
officials say it will cost up to 1 million to repair the 
53yearold bridge damaged spectacularly in tuesdays earthquake 
nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge with the 
upper deck dangling like an open trap door provided the first 
graphic illustration of the magnitude of the quake one woman died 
when she drove her car into the gap 
the bridge had also been in the logo created for the 1989 world 
series between the san francisco giants and the oakland athletics 
since it links the two cities but its closure contributed to 
sundays decision to delay resumption of the championship until 
friday as officials attempt to reduce traffic problems 
the 85milelong bridge carries 260000 vehicles per day and 
the only alternatives are other jammed bridges overloaded mass 
transit systems and a makeshift fleet of ferry boats 
the dangerous and painstaking task of lifting the heavy section 
of roadway out of the damaged area and then lowering it to the 
barge at bay level went without a hitch sunday 
good planning said state department of transportation 
spokesman jim larson it sounds like they made it look easy 
also to be replaced is the section of lower roadway that took 
the brunt of the impact when the upper level fell open 
the lifting and lowering of the damaged section took only 20 
minutes and cables prevented the section from swaying in light 
winds 
the entire upper section measures 74 feet long and 50 feet wide 
and weighs about 200 tons said lisa murphy of the transportation 
department the numbers were modifications of previous 
transportation department announcements 
the section was cut in half by concrete saws and blow torches 
beginning saturday to make it easier to move she said state 
officials hope they can repair and reinstall the upper span she 
said 
bill schott a transportation department engineer said the 
repairs should not cause any additional damage to the bridge we 
are doing nothing more than putting it back together the way it was 
built in the first place he said 
officials are urging commuters to use mass transit car pools or 
ferries while the bridge is closed but everyone is predicting 
traffic nightmares 
monday morning will be a zoo on traffic said bob halligan 
of the transportation department

8monthold baby and other family members 
its just scary i think another disaster is going to 
happen said chavez 20 the little kids are afraid of going 
into any building 
four walls and a roof overhead no longer mean security in this 
predominantly hispanic community where residents are mindful of 
what happened in mexico city four years ago thousands died in a 
tremendous earthquake on sept 19 1985 but many others were 
killed by an aftershock the next day that trapped them inside their 
homes 
now the only place many in watsonville feel safe is among the 
forgiving canvas walls of tents and not even the driving rains 
that have turned their campsites to mud have persuaded them into 
shelters or back to homes that the city has declared safe to enter 
the biggest problem we find is that they are families and the 
children for the most part are frightened to death to go in 
buildings mark svennigsen part of a team from san mateo county 
health services that is helping with relief efforts said saturday 
they are willing to bear up under the cold and rain and 
everything else to keep the children from screaming as they go into 
houses he said 
raymundo leyva is one of those who fear another tremor could 
topple the weakened walls of his house killing anyone foolish 
enough to be inside the us geological survey says there have 
already been more than 2000 aftershocks with more expected in the 
next few days that could cause additional damage 
after tuesdays quake as soon as he could get to a working 
telephone line leyva called his grandparents in mexico who had 
survived their own powerful earthquake 
everyone was crying they said they were happy to hear from me 
because they thought watsonville was gone leyva said they 
thought it was going to happen the same thing that happened in 
mexico city i did too 
watsonville located about 80 miles south of san francisco is 
not gone but uncounted homes and businesses are destroyed 
amazingly only one of the 30000 residents was killed the victim 
of a bakery collapse 
volunteers estimate 500 people have been sleeping in the 
halfdozen tent cities that have popped up in parks and empty lots 
all near areas where the damage has been especially severe 
many others are sleeping in their yards or cars rather than 
enter homes whose foundations have shifted porches have collapsed 
or chimneys have caved in roofs 
three red cross shelters are already at capacity with 1100 
homeless who are willing to stay inside on sunday the red cross 
opened a fullblown shelter of olive drab military tents in ramsey 
park complete with medical and feeding facilities for those 
sleeping on cots 
its unusual but this was something we felt we had to do 
because of peoples concerns said red cross spokeswoman hope 
tuttle 
the tent cities have become relief centers where volunteers from 
throughout the region serve meals and coffee from the backs of 
trucks donated clothes are piled under sheets of plastic and 
anchored by scrap lumber 
and the homeless wearing garbage bags to stay dry wait in long 
lines for food for tents and for diapers they wait for anything 
but a roof over their heads others apparently without even a 
tent push shopping carts full of belongings through the streets 
this place is a disaster pamela cote of the santa cruz 
county human resources agency said as she tried to coax 50 
survivors living in calaghan park to move to 22 army tents erected 
several blocks away by the national guard 
people are everywhere on the streets in this town cote 
said a lot of this is cultural they dont want to leave their 
houses they are afraid people are going to go in houses and take 
things 
even building inspectors word that 363 homes have been checked 
and are safe to enter hasnt appeared to sway many whose confidence 
in even the ground beneath their feet was shaken by the 15second 
jolt 
theres this distrust of government because a lot of people 
are here illegally and they dont want to be turned in cote 
said we are giving services regardless the ins is not going to 
show up 
federal emergency management agency spokesman bill villa in san 
francisco said benefits would be provided to all victims regardless 
of citizenship there is no indication on the application whether 
they are a citizen or not he said disaster victims are 
disaster victims 
city spokeswoman lorraine washington said no attempt will be 
made to ban camping until all homes are inspected and it is 
determined who was left truly homeless workers so far have marked 
330 homes unsafe to enter near the hardhit downtown area where 
officials expect to raze an entire block of businesses washington 
said that total is expected to rise dramatically as workers travel 
into the outskirts of town she said

the premier of hardline czechoslovakia 
said in remarks published sunday that the reforms crushed by soviet 
troops in the 1968 invasion contained positive elements but 
were wrong for the times 
premier ladislav adamec hinted that his countrys leadership may 
reevaluate the prague spring reforms which have been officially 
scorned as a counterrevolution 
we have now a new generation that knows nothing about 1968 and 
will view it with new eyes he said 
adamecs comments came in interviews with austrian journalists 
in prague he was to arrive in austria on monday for an official 
visit 
while he spoke favorably of the 1968 reform program of disgraced 
former leader alexander dubcek adamec also reaffirmed the 
supremacy of the communist party in his country 
in assessing the 1968 reforms adamec said the action program 
had a whole series of positive elements i do not slander 
dubcek and the others 
he said dubcek and his associates simply had no strength to 
cope with the problems of the time he did not elaborate in 
quoted remarks in the austrian reports 
adamec ruled out any challenge to communist rule in 
czechoslovakia should criticism be geared to the liquidation of 
the socialist system we will not accept this he said 
commenting on recent changes in east germany adamec said 
stability based on absolute obedience is not good 
he said the replacement of east german leader erich honecker a 
hardline communist ousted last week amid mass protests for reform 
should have come earlier 
adamec also said 70 east german refugees demanding permission to 
go to the west via the west german mission in prague have a 
guarantee that they may emigrate 
while leaders of hungary and poland have been making democratic 
reforms unprecedented in the sovietled east bloc east germany and 
czechoslovakia have resisted change 
hungarian communists have dissolved their party and formed a new 
one that professes democratic values and poland has formed a 
government led by noncommunist labor leaders 
on reforms in hungary adamec said the hungarians can have as 
many parties as they want i admit our communist party has also 
made mistakes but for that reason it is not necessary to liquidate 
a party right away only because it has made mistakes 
of poland he said i was recently in poland i step off the 
plane and there is a strike in the whole city of warsaw no 
cars no streetcars the shops closed 
the government chief has apologized he has no beer because 
the strike has paralyzed transportation everything stands still 
is that supposed to be an example for czechoslovakia

a fire that charred nearly 11000 
acres in three counties appeared tamed sunday under a light rain 
but firefighters kept a wary eye out for flareups 
if we didnt know anything about southern california weather 
wed say it was out and go home bruce bundick of the us forest 
service said of the fire which began wednesday at this marine base 
and spread to the san mateo canyon wilderness area in the cleveland 
national forest it charred land in orange riverside and san diego 
counties 
youd be hardpressed to see anything even smoldering but the 
problem is until you get a couple days sun on it youre not sure 
where its still hot bundick said all it takes is one root or 
one stump still smoldering that we dont notice and the winds come 
up and its off and running again 
the blaze which had not advanced since friday was declared 65 
percent contained on sunday 
no structures had burned some residents of the nearby rancho 
carrillo housing tract in riverside county temporarily evacuated 
their homes as smoke and dust from the fire filled the air on 
friday bundick said 
the rain has been both a hindrance and a help to the 900 
firefighters on the line although it has helped keep the fire from 
advancing it has turned dirt roads in the area to mud 
three firefighters were injured one with a dislocated shoulder 
another with a cut knee and a third who complained of chest pains 
bundick said

democratic national committee chairman ron 
brown said sunday he doesnt foresee a change in new hampshires 
firstinthenation presidential primary 
i think the impact of iowa and new hampshire has probably been 
as far as the national outcome is concerned has probably been 
grossly overestimated by political pundits said brown in new 
hampshire to address about 200 democratic leaders 
going first is good but im not sure that it has such a 
profound impact over who the ultimate nominees of the party are 
going to be he said 
both the new hampshire primary and the iowa caucus to select 
delegates are held in late february or early march and are the 
first tests of presidential candidate strength 
brown said he does not advocate any radical changes in the 
nominating process which has been criticized by members of both 
parties who say the two states have too much influence in 
determining presidential candidates 
however he said it was good for other states such as 
california which is seeking to move its primary from june to march 
to move up their primary dates if they are frustrated with how 
the field of candidates has narrowed by the time they get to vote 
brown acknowledged the republican dominance in new hampshire 
the gop holds all four congressional seats the governors office 
and all five executive council seats but pledged the national 
committees support in helping get democrats elected in 1990 
brown said the seat being vacated by sen gordon humphrey is a 
good opportunity for democrats as they would not be running 
against an incumbent the 1st district seat in the house also will 
be up for grabs because rep bob smith is running for the senate

chancellor helmut kohl has assured 
poland that west germany has no claims to its territory in comments 
that pave the way for a summit bonn hopes will end 50 years of 
troubled relations 
nearly onethird of presentday poland was part of germany 
before world war ii that land and the ethnic germans living there 
have continued to strain relations with poland 
however kohl has in recent months tried to ease tensions with 
poland which nazi germany conquered 50 years ago he has renounced 
all territorial claims and pressed instead for improved conditions 
for the ethnic german minority in poland 
on saturday the chancellor reiterated in a speech to west 
germanys organization of german exiles that the federal republic 
of germany raises no territorial or border claims against poland 
the organization includes survivors from among the 12 million 
people driven from their homelands after world war ii

which west germany recognizes the oderneisse river boundaries as 
polands western frontier he said his government adheres to the 
letter and spirit of the warsaw treaty in all its parts 
while bonn clearly recognizes polands territorial integrity 
under the treaty some west german politicians say the agreement 
would not commit a reunified germany to its terms 
kohl plans an official visit to poland on nov 914 he will 
take with him a wideranging package of financial aid and political 
agreements that he hopes will provide the basis for eventual 
reconciliation with poland 
despite the 1970 border agreement west germany and poland did

the lebanese parliament on sunday 
passed a powersharing accord intended to end the countrys 
14yearold civil war but christian leader gen michel aoun 
rejected the pact 
fiftynine of 62 deputies present voted for the draft charter 
but made their action contingent on approval by aoun and his rival 
moslem leader salim hoss two deputies abstained and one voted 
against the agreement 
what the deputies approved in taif is a crime i will not 
accept aoun said at a news conference at the presidential palace 
in suburban baabda east of beirut 
i have demanded a syrian withdrawal from lebanon but they 
came up with a peace plan full of ambiguities about this issue 
which constitutes lebanons sovereignty aoun said 
his rejection put the future of the plan in doubt there was no 
immediate reaction from the lebanese lawmakers who retired 
immediately after their latenight session the christian deputies 
had consulted with aoun by telephone before announcing they 
intended to vote for the plan 
lebanons lawmakers have been meeting in saudi arabia since 
sept 30 under the auspices of the arab league the meeting abroad 
was designed to remove them from scene of the fighting 
aoun said he could accept the political reforms in the proposed 
accord which would give more power to the moslems but the 
deputies have actually exceeded their jurisdiction and 
constitutional rights by voting in these ambiguities that 
compromise lebanons sovereignty i reject this plan and reject the 
united states approval of it 
aoun did not say what he meant by us approval 
in washington the white house declined to discuss the peace 
plan were going to withhold comment until things are pinned 
down a little bit more a white house official said on condition 
of anonymity 
aoun heads a lebanese christian government competing for 
legitimacy with the predominately moslem cabinet headed by hoss 
there was no immediate reaction from hoss 
aoun also said that if the syrians threaten to resume fierce 
shelling that battered beirut from march to september his troops 
were ready for battle 
the general proposed putting the peace plan to a referendum of 
the lebanese people 
if they support me i shall lead them to achieve lebanons 
sovereignty otherwise i will reliquish authority he said 
as the parliamentary session began in taif arab league envoy 
lakhdar ibrahimi flew to beirut for separate talks with aoun and 
hoss 
despite aouns comments later ibrahimi told reporters he was 
pleased there had been no new fighting in beirut he also said he 
hoped the atmosphere of optimism and the steps that have begun 
materializing will continue to ensure the interests of the lebanese 
people and end their plight 
the proposal falls short of christian demands for a full pullout 
of syrias 40000 troops in lebanon within three years but 
includes syrian proposals for at least a partial withdrawal it 
also guarantees an equal number of seats for moslems and christians 
in the parliament 
there now are 33 christian deputies and 30 moslem deputies 
the parliament session the first since oct 5 was called after 
saudi arabia guaranteed it would be carried out and the christians 
consulted with aoun and said they had no reservations 
weve reached final and comprehensive agreement george 
saadeh head of lebanons christian phalange party told the 
associated press 
when news of the agreement spread the hotel where negotiations 
were held flung open its banquet halls and served sharbat the 
sweet drink reserved for weddings and other special occasions 
the deputies hugged and congratulated each other as they 
gathered in the conference hall with one absent due to heart 
problems only 73 deputies of the last parliament elected in 1972 
remain alive 10 have boycotted the proceedings 
kazem khalil a shiite moslem deputy said the deputies 
achieved a historic mission today for lebanon and the arab 
world 
under the peace plan the first step in the syrian withdrawal 
would be to move syrian troops out of a 6mile or onekilometer 
radius around parliament in beirut before the legislative body 
convened to ratify political changes and elect a new president 
lebanon has been without a president since september 1988 when 
amin gemayels term ended and legislators were unable to decide on 
a successor 
the plan brokered by the saudi foreign minister prince saud 
alfaisal calls for the syrians to be replaced inside the 
security zone by lebanese police backed by algerian and 
moroccan observers the sources said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the plan does not set a date for a final withdrawal of syrian 
troops from east lebanons bekaa valley a persistent christian 
demand 
instead of a fixed deadline for the bekaa withdrawal syria 
agreed that the issue be handled by a syrianlebanese military 
committee after political reforms are ratified a president is 
elected and a unified government formed 
moslems have argued that the syrian presence is their only 
guarantee political reforms will be carried out 
under the peace plan parliament would be increased to 108 
seats equally divided between moslems and christians the 
parliament currently has 99 seats and their had been disagreement 
over proposals to increase it to 128 seats 
when lebanon received independence in 1943 the majority 
christians were given a 6to5 advantage over moslems in all 
government posts moslems now make up just more than 50 percent of 
the nations population 
sources said deputies asked prince saud for guarantees the plan 
will be implemented the sources said prince saud agreed to provide 
a clarification or statement that would alleviate their concern 
syrian troops were sent into lebanon in 1976 under an arab 
league mandate to quell the civil war 
aoun said the syrian troops violated that mandate by siding with 
moslems in the war he launched a war of liberation against 
syria in march 
more than 900 people were killed and more than 2000 wounded in 
six months of savage shelling duels that ended with an arab 
leaguesponsored ceasefire sept 22

protesters had caused no problems ehrenberg said that prescott and 
other local officials were cooperative as the demonstrators

new hampshire 
the fate of an operating license for seabrook is pending with 
the nuclear regulatory commission in washington but the opponents 
include massachusetts attorney general james shannon who has vowed 
to fight the license in federal court

speculation centered on the planes age more than 20 years and 
on bad weather at tegucigalpas toncontin airport

headed for a normal landing until the moment of the crash he said 
he couldnt see the ground because of the clouds 
i was on fire when the plane stopped i tell you i thought i 
was going to die but i unbuckled my seat belt and i walked out of 
the plane it was all open lopez said 
i put myself out with my hands and walked to a house i saw 
about a block away he said

atlantis astronauts went to bed 
ahead of schedule sunday night after mission control told them to 
come home three hours early monday to avoid high winds at the 
mojave desert landing site 
after spending the day stowing their gear testing the shuttles 
steering system and packing up experiments the five crew members 
said good night to mission control shortly before 9 pm edt 2 
hours earlier than planned 
this will be our last time with you hopefully said mike 
baker an astronaut serving as a spacecraft communicator at mission 
control you guys have done a superb job and well see you 
tomorrow back in houston 
atlantis commander don williams thanked the flight control team 
working sunday night the same crew that helped the astronauts 
deploy the galileo probe 
i think well all as the years pass and galileo journeys 
toward jupiter look back on this one as something that was 
accomplished by a great team working together williams said 
nasa earlier worked out a plan to land one orbit early but 
decided after looking at the forecast sunday to cut short the 
fiveday mission by two 90minute orbits and land at edwards air 
force base calif at 933 am pdt 
cable news network was planning live coverage of the landing 
monday and spokeswomen for cbs and nbc said the networks would 
provide live coverage in the event of an unusual landing abc had 
not finalized its plans as of late sunday said julie vecchione an 
abc spokeswomen 
the shuttles main business sending the 15 billion galileo 
probe on its way to jupiter was accomplished 6 hours after 
liftoff wednesday the craft operated flawlessly nearly 900000 
miles from earth on sunday nasa said 
in relaying the decision to return early mission control 
reported the edwards forecast called for afternoon winds gusting to 
35 mph too high for shuttle safety rules which limit crosswinds 
to 18 mph and headwinds to 29 mph 
at the new landing time headwind gusts to no more than about 23 
mph were forecast flight director ron dittemore said sunday 
crosswinds are not a problem because the astronauts have six 
runways to choose from at edwards 
everything looks real good dittemore said the crew is 
in fine shape the orbiter is in good shape also were not working 
any problems were just looking at the weather tomorrow at 
edwards and we dont expect a problem there either 
asked in a news conference from space if the winds concerned 
him williams replied we have no concern about flying it right 
out to those limits because we know its been done before and its 
been done safely 
williams who flew on a shuttle mission in 1985 described what 
reentry through the atmosphere will be like in the interview with 
cable news network 
reentry heating is rather spectacular if you see it in the 
darkness it looks like youre inside a fire looking out he 
said 
another crew member franklin changdiaz spoke of the galileo 
probe sent on a sixyear 24billionmile voyage to explore the 
colossus of the solar system 
we all certainly breathed a sigh of relief when it went 
according to plan and we kept hearing all the good news from the 
ground that the spacecraft had done all the things that it had to 
do to get on its way he said 
to get ready for the return home williams and pilot mike 
mcculley tested atlantis flight control systems and fired one of 
its steering thrusters they reported all ready to support the 
fiery dash through the atmosphere and landing 
mission specialists ellen baker shannon lucid and changdiaz 
began packing up materials processing medical plant growth and 
other experiments and stowing cameras and other gear 
to adjust their body clocks to the earlier landing the crew 
went to bed 90 minutes early on saturday and 2 hours earlier 
sunday

the formal search for dc10 engine parts ended 
with new discoveries sunday and investigators said they expect 
farmers to find more pieces of the disabled jetliner along the 
flight path in northwest iowa 
the jumbo jet which lost its hydraulic flight controls july 19 
in the breakup of its tailmounted engine north of alta crashed in 
flames in an attempted landing at sioux city killing 112 of the 
296 people aboard 
volunteers using metal detectors sunday found a fragment of a 
fan blade from the no 2 engine of flight 232 and a piece of a 
track for engine ball bearings said jerry clark a flight safety 
investigator for general electric aircraft engines on saturday 
search parties north of alta found two blade retainers that were 
part of the engine rotors and a part of the hydraulic pump 
such discoveries help investigators tell the story of the 
chain of events in the failure clark said 
but one key part still was missing as volunteers from metal 
detector clubs returned to their homes in iowa and surrounding 
states 
the searchers did not locate a flange that connected the forward 
fan shaft to the disc in the aft engine of the engine pieces still 
missing clark said the flange is the thing most important to 
investigators 
while ge ended the formal search clark said he expected parts 
to come in from farmers who have yet to complete their field work 
theres one square mile yet to be harvested along the primary 
path of fragments weve found he said sunday night 
along with the airplane debris searchers also found artifacts 
from more than a century of farming and rural living 
konny droegmiller said sunday that the sleigh bells spiked 
horse shoes and a sledge hammer wont help solve the mystery of the 
crash of flight 232 but that shes glad to have them 
the biggest thing for me was an old brass sleigh bell that 
still rings she said and theres not any rust on it now who 
knows how long that had been out there she said 
the search paid for by ge followed a hunt by more than 100 
members of metal detector clubs last weekend 
the biggest reward this weekend was the 1000 paid sunday for 
the discovery of a set of midspan shrouds for a fan blade 
ge offered more than 270000 in rewards for various parts 
the largest single award of 119000 was claimed this month when 
droegmillers neighbor farmer janice sorenson found most of the 
rear engine fan disc the rest of the disc was found on the nearby 
farm of harold halverson who received about 40000

prime minister yitzhak shamir said sunday he is 
not stalling the middle east peace process and his aides said 
israeli and us officials are holding intense negotiations on 
future talks 
shamirs statements came amid reports from washington that us 
secretary of state james a baker iii is disillusioned over the 
slow pace of negotiations and may soon focus more attention on 
other world problems 
in the occupied west bank soldiers shot and killed a 
16yearold girl in a clash with stonethrowing youths arab 
hospital officials said 
an army spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
confirmed that troops opened fire on stonethrowers in the west 
bank village of bala he said said the military was investigating 
hospital reports that the teenager identified as sana abu zeina 
was killed by the gunfire 
also sunday sami abu laila 18 of the west bank town of nablus 
died of wounds suffered in a saturday clash with troops hospital 
officials said 
the latest deaths raised to 600 the number of palestinians 
killed by israeli troops or civilians in the 22month uprising 
against israeli occupation forty israelis also have been slain 
on sunday an israeli driving near the occupied gaza strip was 
seriously wounded in the head in a stonethrowing incident 
in an address to activists in his rightwing likud bloc shamir 
said i asked the president of the united states not to pay 
attention to those that insinuate that i am running away from the 
peace initiative 
ill say it now and ill say it 1000 times shamir said 
that is a lie because the likud and i within it are for a true 
peace that will serve our security and interests he was speaking 
at a rally in the southern port city of ashdod 25 miles south of 
tel aviv 
shamir telephoned bush on tuesday night to discuss the peace 
process 
the usisraeli contacts were reported as shamirs governing 
partners in the leftofcenter labor party threatened to support a 
parliamentary motion to topple the coalition cabinet unless he 
showed more flexibility with the americans 
foreign minister moshe arens joined shamir in urging us 
officials not to be frustrated with the pace of talks he too 
said israel was aggressively pursuing negotiations 
i think that mr baker also realizes that advancing peace in 
the middle east requires patience arens said on israel 
televisions arabic language service 
shamir adviser avi pazner denied reports that us efforts to 
arrange preliminary talks between israeli and palestinian 
representatives had broken down in disagreement over who the arab 
negotiators would be 
this is not true we are at the height of negotiations with 
the americans pazner said in a telephone interview 
his comments follow an exchange of public criticism between 
israeli and us officials started by shamirs declaration last 
week that he could not be pressured by washington to enter talks 
with palestinians 
israel so far has dismissed efforts by baker to arrange a 
meeting with palestinians on israels stalled proposal for 
elections in the occupied territories 
israeli officials say bakers plan for a meeting with a 
palestinian delegation would leave open a role for the palestine 
liberation organization which israel views as a terrorist group 
plo chief yasser arafat arrived sunday in cairo for talks with 
egyptian president hosni mubarak arafat in remarks reported by 
the middle east news agency described shamir as mr no 
the plo central council also has rejected the american and 
israeli proposals saying they are designed to impose israels 
election plan on the palestinians 
pazner denied reports in israeli newspapers sunday that baker is 
pushing shamir for a quick reply to his proposals 
israels initiative introduced in april calls for elections 
among the 17 million palestinians in the occupied lands to choose 
representatives for peace talks with israel on interim selfrule 
the final status of the territories would be decided in later talks

it was a battle of two chess champions one 
active and outspoken known to sip tonic water during matches the 
other sitting quietly on a desk taking in a different kind of 
juice 
world chess champion garri kasparov who hasnt lost a 
tournament since 1981 met deep thought the winner of this years 
world computer chess championship for two games sunday the human 
won both games 
im very happy i could do in both games what i wanted 
kasparov said in the first game with black i played quietly 
in the second game i tried to crush it in the opening 
the computer retired from the first game after kasparovs 52nd 
move and 2 hours of play after that victory kasparov said i 
expected it its a good player but without position and 
experience 
playing white in the second game kasparov took deep thoughts 
queen in move 18 the computer hung on surrendering after 37 moves 
and 2 hours 
i think the computer needs to be taught something how to 
resign said the 26yearold soviet 
kasparov said after the first game he realized early on that he 
would win when the computer missed some tactical opportunities and 
was not able to analyze all of the champions decisions 
i dont mind whos sitting opposite me said kasparov who 
lives in the soviet city of baku in azerbaijan if a computer 
should win of course i would have to challenge it to protect the 
human race 
murray campbell who helped create the computer program at 
carnegiemellon university in pittsburgh said it appeared there 
was a bug in the computer during the matches 
it wasnt looking at the right moves he said it wasnt 
given a chance to show its best style of play 
chess commentator shelby lyman who helped arrange the match 
said before the games that deep thought was clearly the first 
chess computer with the potential to draw blood and defeat the 
world champion 
lyman predicted the computer would make moves kasparov might not 
expect 
but it was kasparovs moves that caught the computer by surprise 
one of several hundred spectators chess grand master larry 
christiansen complained that computers are killing the 
creativity of chess a lot of the beauty of chess is coming up with 
an original and beautiful idea now with computers everything is 
known 
nineyearold conrad de marez oyens disagreed he has been 
playing against computers for three years and prefers them to 
human counterparts 
when you play it its always a good game even if you lose 
he said predicting that human chess skills will improve because of 
computers 
deep thought created by five graduate students at 
carnegiemellon can analyze possible 700000 positions on the 
chessboard per second and five to 20 moves ahead by each side as 
well as discern each moves implications 
deep thought evaluates the millions of possible board positions 
created by each sequence of five moves it imagines it assigns a 
numerical value to the positions created by each sequence and 
moves toward positions with the highest values 
the computer didnt even have to travel for the match it 
remained in pittsburgh with a telephone line to relay its moves to 
a computer terminal in new york where someone moved the chess 
pieces on a board 
fenghsiung hsu who designed the computers silicon guts said 
he wouldnt call it intelligent its just mathematical 
applications when humans play chess they use their intelligence 
when machines play chess they do calculations 
kasparov said the computer was fully aggressive but that its 
mind was too straight and too primitive 
chess is much wider than just calculations its even wider 
than logic you have to use fantasy intuition and some kind of 
prediction kasparov said 
but he said the computer does have some advantages we can 
lose hope a computer cant lose hope 
one of the main goals of the match is to learn something about 
deep thought said campbell who wrote the computer program with 
fenghsiung hsu 
campbell said he would study the games with kasparov and 
possibly rewrite the program to make deep thought better 
last november deep thought beat denmarks bent larsen the 
first time a computer had defeated a grandmaster in tournament 
play larsen is the worlds 96thranked player with an 
international chess federation rating of 2580 based on his 
tournament performances 
in comparison the computers rating from the united states 
chess federation is 2250 the international chess federation put 
kasparov at 2775 a beginner typically would rank about 1200 
deep thought captured the 1989 world computer chess championship 
in edmonton canada 
kasparov became a grandmaster 10 years ago and captured the 
world championship in 1985 
the match at the new york academy of art was part of an annual 
chess competition sponsored by asg computers inc kasparov was paid 
an undisclosed amount to participate

whittle communications is planning a 
spanishlanguage magazine and a series of daily twominute 
television programs designed to reach the fastgrowing us 
hispanic population 
the project which will be launched in the spring of 1990 
represents the knoxville tennbased media companys first effort 
to reach the hispanic market which the census bureau recently said 
has surpassed 20 million people 
it comes as a number of major advertisers including cocacola 
co pepsico inc and burger king corp have launched ad campaigns 
to reach hispanics 
according to hispanic business magazine national advertisers 
spent more than 550 million on reaching this market last year up 
12 percent from 1987 
whittle plans to sell advertising in both the magazine and the 
tv program in a package and is asking sponsors to make twoyear 
commitments 
peter finn the whittle executive who has overseen development 
of the project said all but a couple of 20 available 
advertising units have been sold out for the first two years at an 
annual price of 500000 per unit 
he declined to identify any of the sponsors but said the 
consumer products giant procter amp gamble co which has been the 
leading advertiser to hispanics had underwritten development of 
the project 
the magazine and tv programs will be designed to provide useful 
information on practical concerns such as family health nutrition 
parenting financial management and education he said 
whats out there now is very much entertainment and 
celebritydriven editorial finn said 
the magazine which will be published once every two months 
will be called la familia de hoy or todays family 
it will be distributed at 10500 locations with large hispanic 
clienteles including doctors and dentists offices hospitals 
clinics and beauty salons four copies will be left at each site 
for reading while waiting 
in addition subscriptions will be available at a price to be 
determined later and tests will be made on newsstand sales and 
distribution through grocery stores in hispanic neighborhoods 
each issue is to be 56 pages long with 20 pages of advertising 
as with another whittle magazine project called special reports 
that is distributed in doctors waiting rooms advertisers will be 
guaranteed exclusivity in their product categories 
but advertisers in this magazine will get a chance to be on 
spanishlanguage television as well 
whittle plans to produce a series of twominute informational 
features that are to air seven days a week on univision the 
nations largest spanishlanguage tv network that reaches an 
estimated 85 percent of the estimated 6 million hispanic 
households it claims a weekly viewing audience of 14 million 
finn said each of the twominute features many of which will be 
video versions of topics covered in the magazine would include a 
30second commercial 
the features will be run five times a day during the week on the 
univision network and three times a day on weekends 
whittle is paying univision an undisclosed amount for the time 
and will provide other considerations such as promotion in the 
magazine

a 21member panel of educators has been named to 
advise on the content of the channel one daily news show for use in 
the classroom that debuts next spring whittle communications 
announced sunday 
the channel one program has provoked considerable controversy 
since it was tested in six schools last spring because each 
12minute show contains two minutes of paid pitches for products 
ranging from candy bars to acne medicine 
critics say it is wrong to allow advertisers to peddle their 
wares to a captive audience of students in school 
but the knoxville tennbased whittle has been recruiting 
schools for the national rollout of the show next spring offering 
to install thousands of dollars worth of tv monitors videocassette 
recorders and satellite dishes in exchange for a promise to show 
the program in class every day 
it has touted the program as a way to keep students informed 
about current events and has encouraged teachers to develop lesson 
plans from the new stories that it covers 
this board will play a critical role in ensuring that the 
channel one programming and support materials for the schools meet 
high and rigorous educational standards said william s 
rukeyser editorinchief of whittle communications which is based 
in knoxville tenn 
the board is expected to meet three or four times a year 
panel members are jay sommer new rochelle ny foreign
