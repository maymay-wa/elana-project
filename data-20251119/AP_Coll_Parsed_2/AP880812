yellowstone national park 
got its first significant rainfall since memorial day on friday 
and the rain and cooler temperatures aided firefighters battling a 
40000acre fire 
in california the pilot of a us forest service plane was 
killed friday when his plane crashed while surveying a fire in the 
sequoia national forest about 35 miles northeast of bakersfield 
calif authorities said 
fires also burned in idaho and montana 
yellowstone received about two hours of intermittent rainfall 
friday 
one short rain shower is not adequate to douse the fires but 
it does help increase humidity in the air and it helps slow the 
fires down said park spokeswoman joan anzelmo 
she said the temperature in yellowstone cooled down friday 
afternoon the wind slowed and firefighters made some progress in 
their efforts to contain fires burning on nearly 200000 acres of 
the park 
park officials on friday morning reopened a road between madison 
junction and old faithful that had been closed thursday because of 
the fire and smoke 
the fire pushed east by winds whipping at up to 40 mph 
thursday had crossed the road in several spots near nez perce 
creek as it grew by about 3000 acres during the day 
the fires north edge was about 1 miles south of the madison 
junction campground which remained open and wind was pushing the 
flames to the east into backcountry anzelmo said 
the 20260acre fan fire in the parks northwestern corner 
remained inside containment lines and burning had slowed on the 
shoshone and red fires which had charred about 34000 acres 
despite the fires tourism in yellowstone remains high anzelmo 
said 
we are continuing to see a very busy park with campgrounds and 
hotels full each night she said but the last two days there 
have been fairly smoky conditions in the park and the vicinity so 
that has been difficult for everyone 
in montana cool cloudy weather slowed a 2800acre fire 
burning in the elkhorn mountains southeast of helena friday fire 
crews continued the slow work of building fire lines by hand in 
steep terrain forest officials said the cool weather also helped 
125 firefighters battling an 8000acre grass and range fire 
southeast of dillon 
in idaho fire crews carved a break line between the raging 
4000 walker creek fire and the southeastern town of inkom on 
friday residents from 16 rural homes were evacuated thursday when 
flames whipped by 60 mph gusts swept over thousands of acres of 
sage grass and groves of trees the families stayed away from 
their homes friday and residents of 32 other homes were warned 
they might have to leave their homes 
no structures were lost and no injuries were reported 
hundreds of firefighters were strung out across the southern 
part of the state against the worst of more than 75 fires started 
by lightning thursday 
were snowed under here just trying to get people on fires 
challis national forest spokesman jim james said were going to 
be really thin on resources 
in the nez perce national forest where thursdays storm sparked 
20 new fires some 180 firefighters tried to regain containment of 
the 1000acre ruby rapids fire after winddriven flames broke 
through the containment line fire bosses hoped to recontain the 
fire by days end and control it saturday 
crews finally controlled the stubborn 1500acre spring canyon 
ii fire in the targhee national forest near the wyoming border 
thursday night and fire bosses were hoping to begin demobilization 
this weekend

thanks to the meddling of a group of 
sharpeyed montana fifth graders oregons d river has lost its 
30year title as the worlds shortest river but not without a 
fight from miffed local officials 
editors of the guinness book of world records agreed to give the 
title to the roe river in great falls mont after students there 
spent the past school year researching the river which flows 
through a state park 
the students concluded the roe is 201 feet far shorter than the 
440foot d river near lincoln city and submitted their evidence to 
the guinness editors 
on the basis of that the roe river was shorter assistant 
editor cyd smith said from the publishers new york office 
news of the change was not wellreceived in lincoln city 
however where the d river has held the title of shortest named 
river for 30 years 
where a river begins and ends may be in the eye of the 
beholder mayor dell isham said wednesday 
in fact lincoln city now insists the d is only 120 feet long 
give or take 5 feet city officials are preparing documentation to 
convince guinness editors that they were right the first time and 
that the d river should regain its rightful title in the books 
1990 edition the deadline is past for next years edition 
of course the question being asked in great falls is how can a 
river shrink from 440 feet to 120 feet at first it was funny but 
fewer people are laughing now that its clear lincoln city is 
serious 
its fun to a point but it has no end when people can come 
back and keep shortening it until its kind of ridiculous said 
susie nardinger the great falls teacher who led her class in the 
river study 
the roe rivers acceptance into the records book is a matter of 
pride to the communitys 60000 residents she said 
our students went about it perfectly innocently she said 
the victory has been marred because oregon came out with its 
claims and in a sense stole the limelight at the peak of their 
success 
signs soon will grace the banks of the roe to proclaim its 
worldclass status about 625 miles away in lincoln city similar 
signs remain along the d river and there are no plans to remove 
them 
isham says the dispute is simply a matter of setting the record 
straight lincoln city insists previous estimates of the rivers 
length inaccurately measured from a point in the river that 
actually is part of devils lake 
that point looked like part of the river because a landfill had 
closed in the banks of the lake isham said 
a spokesman for gov neil goldschmidt says the states governors 
could get out their yardsticks and settle the issue once and for 
all 
if its a good honest fight well be there gregg kantor 
said but itll always be the shortest river in our hearts

secretary of state george p shultz can point 
to some recent successes around the world lately then theres 
nicaragua 
while shultz has seen progress in such areas as afghanistan the 
persian gulf cambodia and southwestern africa this has been a 
particularly bad week for the administration in nicaragua 
shultz found little evidence of support either in washington or 
latin america for his policies and considerable evidence that the 
contra rebels are becoming a spent force 
as shultz was winding up his 10day hemispheric tour wednesday 
the senate for the first time since the contra aid program began 
was rejecting a proposal for military aid for the rebels 
a democratic package was approved instead that includes the 
possibility of eventual military aid but there are so many strings 
attached that administration officials are viewing it as a defeat 
for one thing the legislation does not ensure weapons delivery 
to contras inside nicaragua even if all the other considitions for 
release are met 
meanwhile the contras themselves are looking more and more like 
a refugee force than a fighting force us officials dispatched to 
the border area of honduras and nicaragua on monday were horrified 
by new evidence of a policy gone awry 
the last of a group of about 1000 nicaraguans including 250 
contras and 750 nicaraguan civilians made it to the honduran side 
of the border area after an arduous weekslong trek through rugged 
terrain many were sick or hungry or both many were practically 
naked their boots and clothing having disintegrated along the 
route 
they went to the border because thats where the reagan 
administration unable to send food to the rebels inside nicaragua 
has set up feeding centers for contras and other refugees from 
nicaraguas turmoil 
since the ceasefire in nicaragua went into effect last march 
thousands of rebels have sought refuge in that area 
the question of assessing blame for the plight of the contras 
who oppose nicaraguas leftist sandinista government will be 
debated for years to come the republicans will accuse the 
democrats of betraying a brave people who took up arms on the 
promise of us support the democrats will counter that the 
commitment to start down that path was illadvised to begin with 
in any case the peace process is moribund and the rebel cause 
has never seemed more hopeless in the absence of military aid for 
the contras shultz has sought alternate means of bringing pressure 
to bear on the sandinista government to encourage a democratic 
evolution 
at the start of his recent trip he went to guatemala hoping to 
come away with a joint statement from four friendly central 
american foreign ministers designed to prod the sandinistas into 
making democratic reforms 
the effort did not bear fruit partly because the most reluctant 
of the four parties guatemala and costa rica did not want to 
sign a document that had the appearance of having a made in 
washington label 
beyond that the soviet union which has been generally 
accommodating in other third world trouble spots appears to have 
dug in its heels in nicaragua rejecting us appeals for a 
reduction in military aid to the sandinistas at current delivery 
rates the sandinistas will receive more than 300 million worth of 
soviet lethal aid this year according to us estimates 
so the view here is that the sandinistas despite persistent 
economic problems are more entrenched than ever 
they have unswerving support from moscow and irresolute 
opposition from the reagan administration which soon may have the 
added burden of figuring out what to do with thousands of contra 
fightersturnedrefugees amassed along the border of honduras and 
nicaragua neither of which wants them 
with no other obvious alternative their best hope may be 
obtaining a us green card a problem that president reagans 
successor could well inherit

a record 125 million fine against the 
operator of a pennsylvania nuclear plant whose workers slept on 
duty is meant to wake up utilities and show them that such 
violations carry a price says a government regulator 
philadelphia electric co operator of the dormant peach bottom 
nuclear power plant in southeastern pennsylvania was hit thursday 
with the fine the largest in nuclear regulatory commission history 
sleeping on the job was so common at peach bottom that on one 
occasion a shift superintendent and three of the four reactor 
operators all dozed at once according to testimony by an nrc 
official last year 
the nrc also announced fines ranging from 500 to 1000 against 
the 33 present and former reactor operators the first such civil 
penalties ever proposed for individual operators 
it said the 33 fines involved sleeping andor other acts of 
inattention to duty at the plant on the susquehanna river in 
delta pa 
the nrc called the levies proposed fines explaining that 
both philadelphia electric and the operators have 30 days to either 
admit or deny the alleged violations if they deny the allegations 
the nrc staff will review their complaints before deciding whether 
to uphold the penalties 
peach bottom which is capable of producing 1 million kilowatts 
of electric power was ordered shut down by the nrc on march 31 
1987 the commission said the plant posed an immediate threat to 
the public health and safety 
james taylor the nrcs deputy executive director for regional 
operations said in a letter to philadelphia electric that the 
commission recognized that the utility had made extensive 
personnel changes since then and had ordered reactor operators 
retrained 
but taylor said the fines were necessary to demonstrate to the 
company and to other utilities the significance of the problem 
and to ensure that corrective actions are long lasting 
in addition he said the nrc action should emphasize to all 
licensees that in addition to the cost of corrective action a 
licensee may face the additional costs of sanctions for significant 
safety violations 
philadelphia electric officials said at a news conference in 
holtwood pa that they had not decided whether to appeal the 
record fine 
we have a period of time to evaluate and make that decision 
we have not made it yet chairman joseph f paquette jr said 
paquette said no rate increases would stem from the fine and 
that the company does not expect to seek a rate hike until after 
its limerick ii power plant in suburban philadelphia becomes 
operational possibly in 1990 
philadelphia electric spokesman william jones said the company 
was relieved that the enforcement issue is finally behind us and 
that we may now fully focus our energies on the completion of the 
peach bottom restart plan 
in addition to the fines the commission barred the utility from 
placing in any operational position three officials who were 
toplevel managers at the plant in 1987 the officials held the 
positions of operations engineer superintendent of operations and 
plant manager 
corbin a mcneill jr executive vice president for nuclear 
operations said the officials are still with the company but they 
have been assigned to other nonnuclear responsibilities 
the fine is the largest since congress gave the nrc authority to 
issue civil penalties in 1969 the previous high was a 900000 
fine against toledo edison co for an incident in which the 
davisbesse nuclear plant in ohio had a temporary loss of cooling 
water 
pennsylvania gov robert casey told reporters in harrisburg that 
he was pleased with the fine but wished the nrc had gone further 
and suspended or revoked the licenses of control room operators 
philadelphia electric which still hopes to obtain nrc 
permission to restart the plant said the action has cost 
shareholders 86 million because of the cost of purchasing 
replacement power 
peach bottom is owned by a group of utilities public service 
electric amp gas co owns about 425 percent atlantic electric co 
and delmarva power amp light co own 75 percent each and 
philadelphia electric owns about 425 percent and operates the 
plant

israel has begun breeding pigeons in a bid to 
boost the popularity of the muchmaligned bird a poor mans 
poultry considered a delicacy during biblical times 
the agriculture ministry recently opened four pigeon nurseries 
housing 800 pairs of the birds in the jordan river valley the 
jerusalem post said thursday 
pigeon meat more tender and pungent than chicken was a favored 
delicacy during the time of jesus and around 500 bc when poor 
people sacrificed the bird at jewish temples 
pigeon meat has long been popular in palestinian households 
where many families raise the birds to vary their menu and as a 
cheap alternative to poultry 
zvi karchi who heads the agriculture ministrys research and 
development department said he hoped to popularize the bird in 
israel where poultry is a dietary staple and arabstyle food is 
common 
the newspaper also quoted karchi as saying he expected israel to 
successfully compete with pigeon exporters like the united states 
france and hungary

of course president reagan is playing 
politics these days george bushs protestations notwithstanding 
bush would have a lot more to lament if the white house were 
playing it any other way 
the vice president said the other day that he guessed it was 
inevitable for people to see political motives behind reagans 
decisions on cabinet appointments vetoes and policy decisions 
but i certainly wont add any validity to the charge bush said 
it really isnt much of a charge it is so standard as to be an 
electionyear cliche politicians are always accusing each other of 
playing politics which is rather ironic since thats what they do 
for a living 
besides theres really nothing wrong with it that is the way 
issues are defined and put to the voters if they dont like what 
they see they can vote for the other candidate 
presidents have not always been so helpful to their vice 
presidents in campaigns to succeed them dwight d eisenhower 
didnt do a lot for richard m nixon in 1960 lyndon b johnsons 
handling of vietnam war issues in his final months probably hurt 
hubert h humphreys ticket in 1968 
both those vice presidents lost 
no president can deliver nomination let alone election to his 
vice president or any other candidate but presidents certainly can 
help and reagan is 
he has promised bush two campaign appearances a week from labor 
day on and his white house actions in these waning days of his 
administration are at least as significant an assist 
im just still working on the job here reagan said tuesday 
when questions were raised about political motivation in his 
appointment of a hispanic educator to become secretary of 
education a month earlier the vice president had promised an 
association of latin citizens that he would choose a hispanic for a 
seat in a bush cabinet 
bush said he was consulted before lauro f cavazos president of 
texas tech university was appointed to the education post but he 
said he wasnt claiming credit or responsibility for it 
the influence or interests of the vice president were evident 
in an assortment of other reagan moves including 
his decision not to veto a bill to require advance notice to 
workers when there are to be plant closings or major layoffs 
reagan let the bill become law without his signature rather than 
revive an issue the democrats welcomed in congressional as well as 
presidential politics 
the selection of nicholas f brady a bush confidant to become 
secretary of the treasury succeeding james a baker iii who left 
the cabinet to take command of the bush campaign 
the veto of a 2995 billion defense budget bill on grounds it 
sought to lock the administration into weapons programs favored by 
the democrats defense and foreign policy are issues on which bush 
believes he can master democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis the veto guarantees a new round of action on defense 
spending during the campaign 
the signing on wednesday of a bill to pay reparations to 
japanese americans because of internments during world war ii 
thats particularly significant in california which is where bush 
endorsed the idea during the primary election campaign reagan 
originally objected to the cost but embraced a bill with a ceiling 
on appropriations 
an apparent switch in signals on a contra aid bill that passed 
the senate wednesday night over solid republican opposition the 
democratic bill provides 27 million in socalled humanitarian aid 
but no arms for contras fighting the government of nicaragua the 
military aid issue was left open for possible action later 
bush favors the full array of contra aid sen lloyd bentsen 
the democratic vice presidential nominee has voted for it in the 
past dukakis is opposed to military aid to the contras republican 
campaigners dont want that ticket split forgotten 
not that the democrats are without resources of their own they 
do run congress and as opportunities arise this fall they will 
use that control to the advantage of their candidates and the 
disadvantage of republicans 
and in turn republicans will accuse them of playing politics

more than three months after her 
death the body of ferdinand marcos mother is still unburied as 
her sons dwindling followers maintain a wake in hopes the 
government will allow him to come home 
but civic leaders say that even here in marcos country many 
believe the time has come to place the body of josefa 
edralinmarcos in the marble tomb prepared for her in the family 
cemetery in a swamp on the eastern edge of this town 
mrs edralinmarcos died may 4 at age 95 and her body was 
transferred the following month from manila to the marcos ancestral 
home in batac a town of about 50000 people about 240 miles to the 
north 
family members and marcos supporters say no date for the burial 
will be set until president corazon aquino allows her deposed 
predecessor to return or until marcos orders the interment 
the body has been embalmed at least twice and marcos family 
mortician frank malabed said the remains could remain unburied 
until the end of the year 
the former president has lived in hawaii since a 
civilianmilitary uprising toppled his 20year administration in 
1986 mrs aquino has refused to allow him back for security 
reasons 
to be frank with you we have not been able to set a definite 
date said marcos sister fortuna barba who attends daily prayer 
services before the open coffin in the family home the mansion is 
now a museum 
pictures of marcos and his wife imelda hang from the walls 
alongside banners such as gods will ill return to save my 
nation and people from communism 
were still hoping perhaps against hope that the situation 
will change and something good may come out of it mrs barba 
said 
whatever sympathy marcos may have hoped to generate by his 
appeal to come home appears to have dissipated in the months 
following his mothers death 
filipino newspapers rarely mention the ongoing wake in a rare 
exception the manila chronicle recently suggested an epitaph 
here lies dona josefa marcos died at age 95 buried at age 96 
rodolfo farinas provincial governor of ilocos norte and a close 
friend of the marcos family said if marcos believes he has no 
chance to return he should give the word that his mother should 
be laid to rest 
the rev ruben abaya a roman catholic priest said the arrival 
of mrs edralinmarcos body generated considerable enthusiasm in 
batac because many believed marcos was returning for the funeral 
promarcos politicians erected red white and blue signs in 
batac and in neighboring towns welcoming the former president to 
his provincial stronghold 
but as the weeks dragged on without the apo or grand old man 
both the signs and the enthusiasm are fading 
under a rotation system residents take turns attending daily 
prayers before the casket but attendance has dwindled from 
hundreds to a few dozens each day 
the feeling seems to be that the woman has suffered enough and 
should be laid to rest abaya said 
vice mayor rodolfo yadao a member of marcos new society 
movement party said townspeople were still eager for marcos to 
return 
yadao said however that townspeople were losing patience with 
his nearly fanatical supporters from manila who came here for the 
wake 
we have to provide for them yadao said sometimes they 
are quarelling with themselves she should be buried now that is 
our tradition he was referring to the practice of burying people 
within nine days of death 
at laoag international airport about six miles north the 
military has placed metal barricades mounds of gravel and six 
concrete abutments on the runway shortening it by 1200 yards to 
prevent marcos from slipping in on a charter flight from abroad 
some marcos supporters vow to continue the wake indefinitely 
until their leader returns 
but asked if the family were prepared for an indefinite 
standoff mrs barba replied well i suppose if there is no 
hope ill get a call from him one day telling me to go ahead with 
it

technically defective but the plaintiffs lawyer says the ruling 
ultimately will be a victory 
attorney david kairys said many of the legal flaws found by us 
district judge charles r richey in agent donald rochons complaint 
can be corrected and the case will go forward 
the philadelphia lawyer said richeys order thursday leaves the 
essential element of the case intact 
he has upheld our ability to get personal damages against the 
individual wrongdoers kairys said this is very important and 
was not a matter of certainty when we started this 
in a highly technical opinion richey dismissed without 
prejudice most of the claims against 21 white fbi agents whom 
rochon contends engaged in a threeyear campaign of harassment that 
included anonymous telephone calls obscene mail and death threats 
rochon also contends agents threatened his white wife with sexual 
assault 
the without prejudice proviso richey attached to most of the 
dismissals gives rochon an opportunity to file a new complaint to 
try to correct the legal defects identified by the judge 
richey said the complaint while raising repugnant and 
chilling allegations contains defects in both pleading and 
legal theory that constrain the court to dismiss many of the 
plaintiffs claims 
the judge however refused to dismiss commonlaw claims against 
three white chicago fbi agents gary w miller thomas dillon and 
kenneth veach whom rochon said spearheaded harassment when he 
worked in that city 
richey also refused to dismiss rochons claim that his civil 
rights were violated under title vii of the 1964 civil rights act 
but he dismissed 21 fbi agents and top officials as defendants in 
that claim saying only the attorney general could be sued as head 
of rochons agency 
he also found that many of rochons claims against individual 
agents particularly supervisors who allegedly ignored the racial 
harassment complaints were preempted under other statutes by the 
title vii claim 
kairys chose to hail richeys decision to preserve the civil 
rights claim saying it was the vehicle for the overall harassment 
and discrimination complaint 
the individuals at least temporarily some of them are off 
the hook but the judge has clearly said the only problem is he 
doesnt want title vii and allegations about the individuals to be 
merged kairys said 
that is just a matter of filing an amended complaint which 
separates them he said 
but kairys conceded he will have difficulty sustaining claims 
against the fbi supervisors and managers that rochon claims 
deliberately ignored his complaints 
kairys said he was gratified by richeys stern warning to the 
defendants to stop referring to the racial harassment incidents as 
pranks 
this utter lack of sensitivity is almost as disturbing as the 
alleged acts themselves richey said adding that the court 
hereby warns defendants that a modicum of decency is expected for 
all those who file pleadings in this court 
kairys said the judge really recognized how inappropriate it 
has been for the fbi and the department of justice and their 
lawyers to fail to acknowledge that something other than pranks 
occurred here 
the judge also dismissed altogether complaints against three 
agents arising from alleged racial harassment incidents when rochon 
worked in the fbis omaha neb field office in 1983 and 1984 
richey found that the statute of limitations had expired on those 
claims 
the equal employment opportunity commission upheld many of 
rochons complaints about harassment in omaha the eeocs 
investigation of the chicago incidents was suspended after the suit 
was filed 
rochon 38 now works in the bureaus philadelphia office 
miller who admitted during an internal investigation that he 
forged rochons signature on an application for death and 
dismemberment insurance is the subject of a grand jury 
investigation 
the insurance policy was sent to rochons home as part of what 
miller called an attempt to get retribution for the black 
agents complaints of racial harassment miller was suspended for 
two weeks without pay but fellow white agents took a collection to 
pay his salary according to statements made in court

federal investigators are trying to determine 
why a jetliner was flying at the wrong altitude over the north 
atlantic and almost collided with another jetliner earlier this 
week 
word of the incident emerged thursday when the national 
transportation safety board said it was investigating a report 
filed by one of the pilots who estimated the two aircraft came 
within 200 to 300 feet of each other 
the incident last monday occurred about 700 miles east of boston 
and involved lockheed l1011 jetliners flown by american trans air 
a us charter airline and lufttransport a west german charter 
carrier according to the federal aviation administration 
capt richard reb the american trans air pilot said he was 
talking to his copilot when he suddenly saw the other plane 
through a side window of the cockpit he immediately lowered the 
nose of his plane and descended 1000 feet according to an airline 
spokesman 
at the time both jets were cruising at about 550 miles per hour 
at 35000 feet with american trans air flight 665 flying directly 
west and the lufttransport flight 410 heading southwest and 
converging according to government and airline officials the faa 
said the lufttransport plane should have been flying at 31000 feet 
flight 665 with 250 passengers and 12 crew members was bound 
from lisbon portugal to new yorks john f kennedy airport said 
david recker executive vice president of american trans air which 
is based in indianapolis 
it could not immediately be determined how many people were 
aboard the other plane but such european charter flights normally 
are heavily booked during the summer months according to aviation 
experts the lufttransport jet was bound from frankfurt to cancun 
mexico 
the airspace over the ocean where the incident occurred is not 
covered by radar but jetliners are assigned specific routes speed 
and altitude by controllers at gander newfoundland and at new 
york 
according to the faa the west german plane had just left 
airspace controlled by the gander controllers and entered airspace 
controlled by the faas new york control center when the incident 
occurred 
the german plane should have descended to 31000 feet before 
it entered new york airspace said faa spokesman john leyden 
leyden said preliminary reports indicate that both planes were 
flying the proper route but that it looks like a case of the 
wrong altitude on the part of the lufttransport plane 
faa and ntsb investigators planned to interview controllers at 
both new york and gander to determine whether the lufttransport 
pilot was assigned the wrong altitude 
leyden said both pilots saw the other aircraft 
it was close and its kind of frightening said recker he 
said no one aboard the american trans air plane was injured during 
the incident and that it was over before the passengers were aware 
of anything unusual 
lufttransport is based in dusseldorf west germany according to 
the faa

lawmakers took several steps to fight the 
ocean dumping of medical waste before heading back to districts 
where waves of the infectious debris have marred the summer for 
east coast resort towns and vacationers 
a house subcommittee voted thursday to stiffen federal penalties 
for illegal dumping as congress prepared to leave town for the 
august recess and other lawmakers drafted separate measures to 
track hospital debris and make violators financially liable for 
lost revenue to coastal communities 
meanwhile vice president george bush injected the topic into 
presidential politics calling on attorney generaldesignate 
richard thornburgh to determine if the fbi can be used to 
strengthen government antipollution enforcement 
our ocean should not be a dumping ground the vice president 
said 
bush called medical waste floating up on east coast beaches a 
national disgrace and termed the situation dangerous just 
two days after the reagan administration told congress that 
guidance and education not new rules on disposal of medical 
waste were the answer 
environmental protection agency officials on tuesday had told a 
house panel that they believe the debris does not pose a major 
health threat 
in congress the house judiciary subcommittee on crime approved 
legislation that would create a specific federal law against 
medical waste dumping carrying penalties up to five years in 
prison 250000 in fines and forfeiture of assets such as ships 
used in illegal dumping 
rep william hughes dnj the subcommittee chairman and 
sponsor of the bill said current laws do not address medical waste 
dumping specifically and do not cover dumping in all circumstances 
even if they are apprehended the current penalties amount to 
little more than a slap on the wrist said hughes who represents 
jersey shore communities by making illegal medical waste 
disposal a federal criminal offense we will be raising the stakes 
considerably 
rep gerry e studds dmass who represents resort towns on 
cape cod marthas vineyard and nantucket introduced legislation 
similar to hughes bill but also including a liability provision 
under the studds measure state and local governments would be 
able to recover lost tax revenues from violators in addition 
coastal homeowners could recover for damaged property and fishermen 
and touristrelated businesses could recover for lost business due 
to medical waste 
while the medical risk associated with this debris is fairly 
low it is intolerable that garbage finds its way into the ocean 
and onto our shores said studds chairman of the house merchant 
marine and fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and the environment 
rep bruce a morrison dconn filed legislation calling for a 
manifest system to track medical waste produced in connecticut the 
senate last week passed a similar pilot program proposal for 
connecticut new york and new jersey 
the federal government has no mandatory tracking system and epa 
officials have said they will continue with voluntary efforts 
instead of imposing regulations 
jeffrey d denit head of epas office of solid waste said the 
agency would use education and guidance to discourage companies 
from dumping medical waste at sea

george bush comes to the republican 
convention with more money than anticipated after rationing 
everything from plane travel to office supplies to keep from going 
over the federal cap on spending his staff says 
although bush doesnt have to worry about paying for the 
multimilliondollar superdome convention he does have to pay 
related campaign costs such as housing and staff payroll 
to make those ends meet bush has been forced to keep a tight 
rein on campaign spending over the past few months to stay under 
the 23 million primary spending limit that is set for presidential 
campaigns 
candidates are allowed more than 4 million on top of that for 
fundraising costs which bush also raised and spent 
entering the last six weeks of the campaign bush began july 
with less than 1 million to go before hitting the limit 
he has only to make it through his nomination wednesday night to 
get 46 million from the federal treasury for his fall race against 
democrat michael dukakis until then his campaign is ruled by the 
primary limit 
weve been pennypinchers all along and were very careful 
with our finances said finance spokeswoman ede holiday who 
added obviously we are very close to our spending limit 
she declined to say how close 
four democratic state chairmen have accused bush of overspending 
the limit and filed a complaint with the federal election 
commission last week 
holiday said the campaign kept a tight budget that as planned 
will last just through the convention 
we have plenty of money to do what we want to do at the 
convention she said 
holiday would not say how much the campaign was spending for 
convention activity but said the belttightening in recent weeks 
has left more money to spend on the convention than originally 
anticipated 
one campaign official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
it was well in excess of the 300000 that democrat michael 
dukakis staff says he spent at the democrats convention in 
atlanta last month 
some of the bush staff are working voluntarily until they go on 
the general election payroll after the nomination said holiday 
staff members have talked about having to scrimp on office 
supplies and bush restricted his travel sharply in the waning 
weeks of the campaign to keep from topping the limit 
the lions share of the extravaganza in new orleans including 
the convention itself communications equipment and bush office 
space in the superdome and balloons and banners will be paid for 
by the republican national committee and to a lesser degree the 
local host committee 
the republicans as the democrats did in atlanta receive 92 
million from the federal treasury to put on their conventions 
the money comes from the same taxpayersupported federal fund 
that doles out primary matching money to the candidates and gives 
each general election candidate 46 million 
mary mead deputy convention manager for communications said 
most of the money went into construction and logistics costs while 
many of the decorations inside and outside the hall were paid for 
by the city of new orleans 
the louisiana host committees efforts centered on promoting new 
orleans through such projects as decorating the airport providing 
media kits about the area and plastering the city with banners and 
billboards reading new orleans host to the future and the 1988 
republican convention said bonnie hymel executive director of 
the committees media and hospitality effort

the national rifle association has served 
notice that even its strongest backers will feel its wrath if they 
support legislation to require a sevenday waiting period when 
buying a handgun 
nra letters mailed across the country urge the gun lobbys 
supporters to pressure members of congress to defeat the measure 
but even conservative republicans who call themselves nra 
supporters said thursday that the mailings contain factual 
distortions and some of the gop members are downright angry 
they ought to stop beating up on their friends said rep 
john j rhodes iii rariz who is undecided on the legislation 
they are really screwing up their credibility with people who 
supported them for a long long time 
the nra especially angered rep f james sensenbrenner jr 
rwis who said the organizations letter attacking him personally 
is downright erroneous false and plays on hysteria in an attempt 
to get me to change my vote 
sensenbrenner said he supports the waiting period and wont 
change his mind 
the nra official who signed the letters wayne lapierre said 
sensenbrenner was singled out because he wrote his constituents 
proclaiming his support for the right to keep and bear arms 
you dont have it both ways said lapierre director of the 
nras institute for legislative action everybody knows this is a 
big gun vote youre either for gun owners or against gun owners 
if someone is going to vote for a bill that takes these rights 
away were going to fight back thats what sportsmen and gun 
owners expect us to do 
the waiting period measure part of omnibus drug legislation 
that the house will vote on in september would require a sevenday 
wait in the purchase of a handgun from a licensed dealer 
the dealer must send to law enforcement authorities a sworn 
statement that includes a description of the gun the serial 
number and the name address and birth date of the buyer police 
may but are not required to conduct a background check 
purchasers who would be prohibited from buying handguns would be 
those already ineligible under existing federal law convicted 
felons fugitives from justice illegal aliens drug addicts those 
adjudicated mentally ill or committed to a mental institution 
those dishonorably discharged from the military and people under 
indictment for a felony 
twentytwo states already have enacted a waiting period of 
varying duration 
the nra contends the waiting period would amount to a national 
registration of handguns would cost hundreds of millions of 
dollars to enforce and would require a bureaucrats permission 
to buy a gun 
conservatives and liberals alike said all these assertions were 
wrong 
but conservative house members targeted for pressure said that 
perhaps the ultimate insult was the nras attempt to link them to 
liberals who support gun control 
lapierre wrote sensenbrenners constituents i have in my hand 
a letter dated july 1988 from the sensenbrenner campaign committee 
for reelection proclaiming his fight for gun owners rights 
ha with support like that you might as well have ted kennedy 
representing you 
kennedy dmass is one of the most liberal senators and is a 
strong supporter of handgun control 
while other versions of the letter do not attack individual 
lawmakers they make the same points about the legislation 
the nra contended that backers of the bill want the police to 
visit your home before you can buy a firearm yet police right now 
dont have the resources to send cruisers to investigate 
residential burglaries in many areas 
lapierre defended the statement even though no such language is 
in the bill he said it was a response to statements made by 
backers of the legislation that police would drive by homes to 
check addresses on a gun purchasers forms 
responding to a criticism of sensenbrenner lapierre 
acknowledged that the nra supported waiting periods in the early 
1970s but changed its mind a few years later when it found they 
dont stop crime its simply red tape for honest people 
other lawmakers angered by the nra campaign included rep dan 
lungren rcalif a judiciary committee member who has backed past 
nra positions and rep herbert h bateman rva who considers 
himself a strong supporter of the right to own guns 
lungren called the attack on sensenbrenner a pretty desperate 
letter against one of their supporters 
bateman said i am shocked and disappointed at the excessive 
language and tactics used by the nra in the letter to my 
constituents

vice president george bush and house speaker 
jim wright locked horns at a washington dinner party after wright 
said he was surprised and hurt that bush had called for a 
special prosecutor to investigate ethics charges against him 
aides to the two officials described the wednesday night episode 
after insisting on anonymity they said bush retorted by 
complaining about the democratic convention where speakers 
referred to bush as a toothache of a man and taunted where 
was george in suggesting he was an invisible vice president 
the aides provided differing descriptions of the intensity of 
the exchange which occurred at the annual house gym dinner given 
for members of congress who use the house athletic facilities 
it was a polite private discussion not a heated exchange no 
profanities said the wright aide in contrast the bush aide 
said 
it was quite a heated exchange with a lot of witnesses wright 
started screaming and yelling that he bush had impugned his 
wrights integrity the bush aide said wright used profanities 
wright called bush on thursday but not to apologize wrights 
aide said the aide said wright reassured him there was no 
personal animosity of any sort and the two agreed they could 
make contributions by maintaining a high standard in their 
personal relationship 
sheila tate the campaign press secretary to the vice president 
said bush told me this morning if you get any calls you can 
be authorized to say that i talked to the speaker this morning and 
i appreciated his call 
wright and bush have known each other since the 1960s when they 
served together in the house as junior congressmen from texas 
wrights aide said bush approached the speaker at the dinner and 
asked how he was doing the speaker said he was disappointed in 
bush for calling for a special prosecutor to investigate wright on 
ethical issues particularly the financial arrangements involving 
the publication of a book by wright and reports that the speaker 
had tried to get special treatment for texas bankers wrights 
actions are being investigated by a special counsel to the house 
ethics committee 
wrights aide said the speaker has always enjoyed a personal 
rapport with bush and has never had any personal harsh feelings 
toward him 
on a number of occasions including one with the press he had 
defended bush from what wright considered unwarranted attacks and 
bum attacks he said wright in front of reporters defended bush 
from charges of being a wimp and the next week bush called for the 
special prosecutor and came out with his attacks on wright 
last night wright reminded him of his defenses of bush and 
told bush that should bush be elected president wright would be 
speaker and the two would have to work together the aide said 
wright never engaged in any personal attacks on bush and he was 
surprised and hurt bush gratuitously had gone out of his way to 
attack wright personally 
he said he had no personal hostility toward bush he was glad 
he had spoken to him thats what a friend should do if he felt 
that another friend had let him down or done him injury

those who follow the rapidly moving 
events are uncertain of the outcome in burma where unarmed 
citizens are angry enough to confront rifles and the government is 
willing to shoot them down 
diplomats and other observers sketch a variety of finales to the 
drama that began with president sein lwins accession to power late 
last month and has progressed through increasing levels of popular 
protest and violence 
security forces initially were restrained and disciplined but 
soldiers opened fire tuesday on thousands of demonstrators in the 
streets of rangoon official reports say protest has spread to 
virtually every town and city in the the southeast asian nation of 
38 million people 
high school students in their midteens were the vanguard but 
witnesses say buddhist monks workers and ordinary townspeople have 
joined the mass denunciation of 26 years of authoritarian rule and 
economic deprivation 
these are some of the results foreseen by diplomats in scenarios 
by diplomats in rangoon and bangkok 
continued ruthless suppression of all protest by sein lwin and 
a loyal army until all opponents are rooted out or cowed into the 
passivity that characterized the political scene until recent 
events 
the ouster of sein lwin by former strongman ne win who 
overthrew the democracy in 1962 he formally retired from political 
life last month but some believe he still pulls the strings 
an intensified and bloody uprising that would compel the army 
burmas most powerful institution to overthrow the government and 
install a more moderate leadership 
unlike the philippines or south korea where mass popular 
protest achieved greater political freedom burma has no prominent 
personalities advocating democracy who could lead the growing but 
diffuse opposition 
aung gyi the most outspoken critic of the system is 70 and 
retired from politics after falling out with ne win in the early 
1960s sein lwin has jailed the former army officer a relative 
liberal 
protesters seem to illustrate this dearth of political 
alternatives by resurrecting old symbols and the images of leaders 
long dead 
rangoon marchers carry portraits of aung san the dashing 
fighter for burmese independence who was assassinated in 1947 and 
wave the peacock flag of days when burma struggled against its 
british colonial masters 
like the philippines under ferdinand e marcos burma has a 
strong military in which increasing disaffection is reported some 
diplomats speculate that elements of the army as in the people 
power revolution that ousted marcos could provide the muscle to 
bring down sein lwin a former general 
the military has been burmas privileged class since ne win 
seized power however retired or active military officers 
currently hold all but two cabinet positions and even the rank and 
file has privileges civilians do not enjoy 
ne win assiduously built or bought the loyalty of a generation 
and more of army officers although his proclaimed ideology has 
been a mix of socialist economics buddhism and isolationism 
political control has rested with the military and the 
armydominated government political party 
i find it hard to believe such a man steeped in power since 
1962 giving it all up in one fell swoop something smells here 
said a western diplomat based in rangoon who spoke on the condition 
he not be identified 
he added however that if ne win returned the question remained 
whether the people now would accept the lesser of two evils 
even if he pursued urgently needed economic reforms 
some protesters still call the government the ne win regime 
and demand restoration of democracy marchers applauded loudly this 
week when passing the us embassy in rangoon 
others say they are fighting for socialism minus sein lwin who 
is widely hated for ruthlessly suppressing dissent since the 1960s 
the young people havent known anything in their lives but 
this system a burmese intellectual said recently they dont 
know exactly what they want or how to get it 
many westerners arriving from rangoon say burmese from many 
walks seem certain of one thing they have had enough of leaders 
who provide neither freedom nor rice

for persons convicted of killing police officers and prison guards 
during his first term the death penalty was reinstated in 
pennsylvania during his second term thornburgh signed warrants 
setting execution dates for several convicted murderers appeals 
courts granted stays in each case 
on gun control thornburgh said while campaigning for his first 
term that he opposed further government regulation of the sale or 
purchase of firearms subsequent public statements on this issue 
could not be found while governor thornburgh signed a bill 
setting a mandatory fiveyear sentence for any person convicted of 
using a gun during a crime

the dawn of peace in the 8yearold 
iraniraq war is likely to be a sunset for the hopes of rebels in 
each country diplomats say 
the ceasefire announced monday may close crucial border 
sanctuaries used by the kurdish rebels fighting iraq and the 
leftist peoples mujahedeen seeking to topple irans ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini 
that can only be bad news for kurdish rebel leader jalal 
talabani who declared in an april interview with middle east 
magazine we can no longer live with iraqi president saddam 
hussein in the same country now its either him or us 
the ceasefire will take effect aug 20 and 350 un observers 
are to be in place along the 730mile border within a week that 
gives both countries a chance to concentrate on eliminating their 
rebels 
i dont think the iraqis are going to be anything other than 
merciless toward the kurdish rebels said a western diplomat in 
baghdad 
talabanis patriotic union of kurdistan fighting for a kurdish 
republic scored a series of military successes against iraq late 
last year in alliance with iranian forces 
but their fortunes faded as irans army appeared to crumble this 
year and diplomats say iraq largely has squashed the kurdish 
forces 
witnesses said iraq has tried to rob the rebels of base areas by 
bulldozing dozens of villages in mountainous northern iraq where 
about 25 million kurds live 
its just one destroyed village after another said a 
diplomat who has toured the area 
kurds from different villages have been moved to newly built 
towns of gray concrete houses breaking the tight social 
solidarity of village life that rebels often used for protection 
kurds will continue to be kurds but the village way of 
life is a thing of the past said the western diplomat who spoke 
on condition of not being identified further 
a 1975 iraqiran treaty closed the border to rebels in each 
country helping quell kurdish dissidence at that time but irans 
later support of kurdish guerrilla action was one of the fuses that 
led to full explosion of the war in september 1980 
iraq in the past also supported kurdish dissidents inside iran 
but its main aid during the war went to the mujahedeen khalq which 
moved to iraq after its leaders were expelled from france in 1986 
the mujahedeenled peoples liberation army of iran made a 
series of raids into iranian territory this year the latest drove 
60 miles into iran and briefly captured two cities 
military observers said there is evidence that iraqi forces 
aided the iranian rebel operations an allegation iraq and the 
rebels denied 
but a wellplaced iraqi source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said his government would almost surely block the border 
to the mujahedeen as part of any ceasefire 
the mujahedeen khalq being based in baghdad does have a lot to 
do with the conflict he noted 
no doubt any peace settlement will mean the mujahedeen khalq 
wont operate from iraqi soil said a european diplomat 
mujahedeen spokesman ali riza jafer zada refused to say whether 
the organization would move its battle entirely within iran but he 
insisted that closing the border would not stop the rebellion 
against khomeini 
we have tremendous support inside iran he said that 
would be no problem

soviets are caught in a paper chase brought on by 
mikhail s gorbachevs policy of openness they cant get their 
fill of glasnostinspired writing for the same reason they cant 
get enough toilet paper a paper shortage 
in a country where people read voraciously the problem is more 
than just another wrinkle in daily life 
it means some people could miss vigorous debates in the 
staterun press about the countrys history and about gorbachevs 
wideranging social and economic reforms 
thousands have left post offices emptyhanded after trying to 
apply for their favorite newspaper and magazine subscriptions they 
have been waging a paper war against the problem deluging 
newspapers with letters of protest 
its understandable that we constantly have a paper deficit 
but in our time of revolutionary renewal the thoughts and feelings 
by which the country is living is concentrated in the newspapers 
and magazines therefore it wouldnt be awful to sacrifice the 
circulation of other publications society would be generously 
repaid muscovite n shulgin wrote in a letter published aug 6 
in the cultural daily sovietskaya kultura 
since gorbachev came to power in march 1985 and encouraged more 
open discussion of the countrys problems and history citizens 
have been snapping up periodicals like ogonyok and moscow news that 
are at the forefront of the new openness or glasnost 
such periodicals quickly sell out at newsstands and 
subscriptions are hard to come by 
last year soviets rejoiced when it was announced that 
applications for 1989 subscriptions for the staterun press would 
be accepted throughout 1988 in previous years orders were taken 
only after aug 1 
but the jubilation was premature the sad tale of wouldbe 
subscribers has been unfolding the past two weeks in the soviet 
press 
when jan 1 rolled around soviets were told they could only 
sign up for newspapers and had to wait until august for magazine 
subscriptions but on july 20 the ministry of communications 
issued what has now become an infamous order directive no 315 in 
effect limited the number of 1989 subscriptions to their 1988 
level 
further restrictions apply to 41 publications including such 
popular sellers as ogonyok soviet sport and literaturnaya gazeta 
the skys the limit however for the more conventional some 
soviets would say boring publications like communist party life 
and political education 
the problem extends to books authors complain that because of 
the paper shortage they have to wait years for their works to be 
published 
the government newspaper izvestia complained aug 1 that soviet 
publishers waste limited paper and printing facilities producing 
huge stacks of political tomes and brochures that few people want 
to read 
faced with the public outcry over limits on subscriptions the 
ministry of communications has been put on the defensive 
two of its top officials have appeared in print explaining 
the restrictions and complaining that they cant keep up with 
demand gennady g kudryavtsev first deputy minister of 
communications said in an interview with the tass news agency 
published thursday that since 1985 when gorbachev took power 
magazine and newspaper circulation has increased annually by 20 
million copies the average soviet family receives seven 
publications he said 
kudryavtsev said the new restrictions became necessary only 
because of the subscription boom and paper shortage he said 
paper production had dropped in part because mills are big 
polluters and the government is paying more attention to 
preserving the environment under gorbachevs leadership 
he suggested people consider sharing or as he put it 
collective subscriptions

a woman who was once americas lowestpaid 
teacher is giving up a higherpaying job in texas to reopen the 
oneroom schoolhouse where she taught for 16 years and some 
parents and children couldnt be happier 
it keeps the community going we dont want to be dying out 
here peggy sveum whose two children will attend the grammar 
school said thursday 
janice herbranson 54 took a job teaching toddlers in progreso 
texas after the school closed in 1986 the school board decided it 
was not practical to keep the building open for the rural 
districts one remaining pupil 
with five children through grade 6 living in the district now 
ms herbranson the schools lone teacher for 16 years will be 
back when classes begin anew aug 29 
the whole community feels that something is back to life its 
exciting for all of us said ms herbranson 
ms herbranson said she was happy teaching in texas but that she 
considers her home to be mcleod a community of 45 people set in 
wideopen cattle country she maintains a home here and is part 
owner of the sand dune saloon 
mrs sveum said her daughters firstgrader erin and 
kindergartener lisa no longer will have to endure a 45minute bus 
ride to a school in lisbon about 25 miles away and will benefit 
from a oneonone relationship with the teacher 
theyre very much looking forward to it she said they 
went up while we were cleaning the school and they were playing 
school themselves writing on the chalkboard 
five years ago at mcleod ms herbranson earned the dubious 
distinction of being the lowestpaid teacher in the nation with a 
6300 salary the salary had increased to 6800 when the school 
closed but her texas job paid 25000 ms herbranson said she did 
not know how much she would be paid here but that it will be a 
substantial pay cut from her texas job ilef olerud school board 
president said the board was still negotiating a contract 
it doesnt cost me anything to live here in comparison to down 
there texas said ms herbranson it doesnt even out but 
its not a drastic difference 
ms herbranson said she believes the mcleod school has a bright 
future with several preschool children in the district 
enrollment is expected to grow she said 
she said the reopening is a victory of sorts for rural oneroom 
schoolhouses its a good type of education theres no doubt in 
my mind she said

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
says he hopes an independence referendum can be held in the western 
sahara this year and offered detailed proposals to end the 
guerrilla war there 
the un chief urged morocco and the polisario proindependence 
movement to respond to his proposals by sept 1 details of the 
ideas were not released 
morocco has occupied the territory since the spanish colonial 
administration withdrew from what had been the spanish sahara 
protectorate in 1975 fighting with the marxistled polisario 
movement began soon after 
morocco and mauritania jointly ran the western sahara until 
mauritania withdrew from the conflict in 1979 moroccos battle 
with polisario has engaged most of its 100000man army and has 
cost morocco up to 2 million a day 
nearly 10000 people have been killed in the war 
perez de cuellar presented his proposals for organizing a 
ceasefire and a referendum on thursday to representatives of 
morocco and polisario and to the organization of african unity 
algeria and mauritania 
he said details are being kept confidential but added that the 
rather long document was the result of extensive discussions 
among the parties so they wont be extremely surprised by his 
suggestions 
the current chairman of the oau and i have carried out a 
number of consultations with the parties to the conflict in order 
to find the means to bring about practical conditions which would 
allow the people of the western sahara to freely exercise their 
right to selfdetermination through a credible referendum and 
without military or administrative constraints said the 
secretarygeneral 
asked if the referendum will be held this year perez de cuellar 
replied that is our hope 
spain made little effort to develop the 110000squaremile 
wilderness about the size of colorado it is rich in phosphates 
and possibly potash and iron ore but had a population of only about 
75000 when spain pulled out 
polisario claims to have 16000 heavily armed guerrillas 
operating in the desert moroccan officers estimate guerrilla 
strength at fewer than 4000

return the next day at dawn to rest and sleep circling about 300 
feet overhead before they dive in clusters into the cavern opening 
as night approaches the cycle begins anew

the soviet union has lodged a formal 
diplomatic protest about members of a us energy department team 
who attempted to ship sensitive materials from a nuclear test site 
in the soviet union to the united states the washington post 
reported thursday 
the shipment seized by soviet authorities on july 17 involved 
tools and wire associated with soviet nuclear test preparations and 
soil and rock samples which could be used in assessing yields of 
nuclear blasts the report said the team members were not 
identified 
the project in question was part of the joint verification 
experiment concerning nuclear testing and has nothing to do with 
on site inspection or the inf intermediaterange nuclear force 
treaty a defense department spokesman told the associated press 
the story quoted robert barker assistant to the secretary of 
defense for atomic energy and chairman of the military liasion to 
the department of energy as saying the incident was absolutely 
not a deliberate us plan to collect prohibited materials 
contacted by telephone thursday night barker initially denied 
making the printed comments saying that is absolutely wrong i 
never said anything like that at all 
asked if he had not spoken to the newspaper the senior us 
official abruptly said no comment 
questioned further about details in the report barker again 
responded no comment good night he refused to answer 
questions involving the sovietus experiment the post described 
baker as key participant in negotaitions leading to the us 
visit 
the project was the first time the two nations had begun to 
allow the other to observe and closely monitor their nuclear 
blasts the experiment is expected to lead to adoption of onsite 
inspection measures to supplement traditional longdistance 
surveillance by seismic and statellite sensors 
the shipment in question was discovered when soviet officials 
searched a a crate of personal belongings of a us official and 
two employees of private companies under contract to the federal 
government the post said 
the agreement which was drawn up in june mandated tht none of 
the hand tools wire soil samples rocks and other materials 
discoverd in the crate could be legally removed from the testing 
area the paper said 
baker and other unidentified us officials were quoted in the 
report as maintaining that the incident which prompted the soviet 
protest to us diplomats on july 25 was an honest 
misunderstanding 
although the soviets demanded permanent expulsion of three team 
members who had already left the country the united states was 
able to obtain permission for one of the employees who was not 
responsible for the attempt to remain 
the post quoted unnamed senior us officials as saying the 
incident was not expected to halt the progress of the experiment 
which calls for observation of tests at the us site in nevada and 
a special esperiment at the soviet semipalatinsk site 
officials at the energy and state departments departments and 
the soviet embassy declined comment on the incident the report 
said

most doctors are not using clotdissolving drugs 
to treat heart attack victims even though studies suggest such 
treatment along with aspirin can dramatically reduce heart attack 
deaths say participants in the latest study 
our object is to get the results of this treatment widely 
known so people will get this treatment said dr peter sleight 
chairman of the new studys steering committee 
on thursday sleight and his colleagues reported that giving an 
aspirin and a clotdissolving drug within 24 hours of the onset of 
a heart attack can reduce the death rate over the following five 
weeks from 13 percent to 8 percent 
this should now be considered standard treatment the doctors 
said but at the moment most patients in the united states dont 
have bloodclot dissolving treatment of any type said richard 
peto one of the researchers 
ive never seen a trial that produced results as striking as 
these ones he said 
peto said the treatment could save the lives of 25000 of the 
500000 americans who have heart attacks each year if they all 
received it 
it costs about 150 and can be done at any community hospital or 
even by a doctor outside a hospital the researchers said 
peto and other study participants spoke at a press conference 
held in london and new york in conjunction with publication of the 
latest findings in the forthcoming issue of the lancet a british 
medical journal the results were widely publicized in march at a 
meeting of the american college of cardiology in atlanta 
the researchers studied 17187 patients at 417 hospitals around 
the world some patients were given aspirin and some the 
clotdissolving drug streptokinase another group was given both 
and a control group was given neither 
the death rate up to five weeks after a heart attack was 13 
percent in the untreated control group it dropped to about 10 
percent in the patients given either aspirin or streptokinase and 
it dropped to 8 percent in patients given both drugs peto said 
furthermore the study showed that the drugs reduced deaths in 
elderly patients who were previously not thought suitable for 
clotdissolving treatment because doctors thought it might increase 
their risk of strokes peto said 
it also showed that the drugs were helpful even if given as late 
as 24 hours after the onset of chest pains peto said 
streptokinase is derived from streptococcus bacteria which 
cause strep throat most heart attacks are caused by a clot 
blocking the coronary arteries which provide a nourishing blood 
supply to the heart muscle 
streptokinase dissolves the clots and aspirin helps to prevent 
the clotting of blood cells called platelets thus helping to 
prevent reformation of clots the researchers said 
the researchers found no increase in the rate of strokes 
following the treatment streptokinase caused potentially hazardous 
low blood pressure in 8 out of 100 patients but this can be 
easily dealt with provided doctors and nurses are aware that it can 
occur said dr rory collins another study participant 
the study called the second international study of infarct 
survival or isis will be followed by a third isis study intended 
to compare the effectiveness of streptokinase with other 
clotdissolving drugs 
the most widely publicized of the alternative drugs is tissue 
plasminogen activator or tpa which is produced by genetic 
engineering and costs some 2000 per treatment compared to the 
150 cost of streptokinase 
current data does not allow a direct comparison of the 
effectiveness of the two drugs the researchers said 
peter drake a biochemist and securities analyst with vector 
securities international in deerfield ill said that the dramatic 
success of streptokinase would likely force down the price of tpa

republican lawmakers say they expect president 
reagan to sign legislation that rushes 672 million to the veterans 
administration the federal prison system and an assortment of 
other programs said to need the money 
the house approved the supplemental spending bill by a 27032 
tally late thursday then sent the measure to the senate where it 
passed on a voice vote and was sent to the white house 
lawmakers prided themselves on fighting off temptation and 
refraining from the frequent practice of attaching pet projects to 
the measure saying they abided by a pact congressional leaders 
reached with reagan last fall the legislation was labeled a dire 
emergency bill because the measure was supposed to be limited to 
that type of spending 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash said it was a 
very stringently conceived bill that is absolutely required for the 
continuation of many essential services 
the 672 million bill was a compromise between a 189 million 
measure approved by the house on july 27 and a 633 million version 
passed by the senate on wednesday the bill is for the 1988 fiscal 
year which ends sept 30 in addition to the fresh money the bill 
would allow 200 million to be transferred among the budgets of 
various agencies 
eyeing a nearly monthlong recess that began at the close of the 
days business conference committee members worked out the 
compromise and rushed the bill through final approval in both 
houses in a single day 
the few objections in the house came from legislators who 
complained this measure was no different from other spending bills 
this is no emergency said rep bill frenzel rminn 
as often happens with spending bills in congress the deal was 
reached by each chamber agreeing to most of what the other had 
proposed rather than mutually chopping away at each others 
soughtafter projects 
thus the house accepted senate provisions that would give the 
veterans administration 530 million in new spending to help pay 
for an increase in some benefits a burgeoning caseload and medical 
care 
the senate also had sought 23 million to help the fbi keep an 
eye on soviet inspectors monitoring american compliance with the 
new nuclear arms treaty the final bill contained 14 million of 
that amount 
the senate consented to spending 15 million for state 
unemployment programs the house had wanted 50 million and 24 
million the house wanted so the government can process refugees 
from the soviet union eastern europe and elsewhere 
in addition the measure bore 75 million for the department of 
justice mostly for expenses arising from last years rioting by 
cuban detainees in prisons in atlanta and oakdale la 
it also had 60 million to help the coast guard keep its patrols 
going 55 million for the agriculture department to pay for some 
drought costs 49 million for benefits to people who lose their 
jobs because of foreign competition and 43 million for payments 
to people with black lung disease

the worlds secondlargest convenience 
store chain says it will postpone a plan to deny medical benefits 
to employees with ailments related to drugs alcohol or aids 
because of a general misunderstanding of the policy 
adopted in january by circle k stores the policy met with a 
storm of protest when it was publicly disclosed last week 
the company said it would no longer pay for employees medical 
care for illnesses resulting from personal lifestyle decisions 
including the use of alcohol or drugs selfinflicted injury or 
infection with acquired immune deficiency syndrome through any 
means other than blood transfusions 
the policy applied to about 3000 circle k employees hired since 
jan 1 the company said no employee has been denied coverage so 
far as a result of it since the company is selfinsured its 
health care plan is not covered by state regulations banning such 
restrictions most health insurance policies exclude coverage for 
suicide attempts but cover claims related to aids and substance 
abuse 
the phoenixbased company has about 26000 employees at more 
than 4000 stores in 27 states it also has about 800 other stores 
in japan the united kingdom canada indonesia and hong kong it 
had sales of about 2 billion last year 
karl eller circle k corpss chairman and chief executive 
officer announced thursday that the plans implementation would be 
delayed while it was reviewed by company officials 
a general misunderstanding of the policy has arisen and that 
needs to be clarified eller said we were and still are 
extremely concerned about containing costs of medical insurance for 
employees 
ed buck a phoenix gayrights activist met with company 
officials wednesday in an attempt to negotiate a change in the 
policy he called the announcement an excellent excellent 
signal 
buck said he and circle k officials agreed on four points 
there are ambiguities in the corporations healthbenefits 
policy 
the intention of the policy which is to cut the cost of health 
insurance is legitimate and wellmeaning 
the policy is open to review and possible revision 
the company and the gayrights activists will meet again monday 
ray cox a circle k senior vice president said the company 
agreed that clarification of the policy was needed but noted the 
agreement was to review the policy not cancel it 
i dont feel were conceding anything at this point he said 
buck who gained prominence by directing the 1987 campaign to 
recall thengov evan mecham said the primary problem with the 
policy was that the company became the judge of its employees 
lifestyles 
that creates two problems buck said one is that the 
employee doesnt know whether he is covered in any given instance 
the second is that it creates an administrative nightmare for the 
company in deciding on a casebycase basis what claims it will pay 
for 
buck said some gay activists favored picketing and boycotts of 
circle k stores but he counseled against it 
i think that they circle k are willing and anxious to open 
goodfaith negotiations buck said 
i told them that this is an emotional issue and they the gay 
community are reacting emotionally he said i told the other 
side that they must recognize the companys goal of 
costcontainment is legitimate but the policy became confused 
muddled and misdirected

a member of parliament says austrian president 
kurt waldheim while an officer in the german army during world war 
ii caused the execution of a british prisoner who led an allied 
escape attempt 
robert rhodes james a conservative party member said thursday 
that waldheim should be tried on war crimes charges 
the house of commons member told the associated press by 
telephone that he based his accusations on a british historians 
claims that waldheim signed a germany army intelligence report 
labeling british army capt david warren a saboteur 
the action constituted a virtual death sentence for warren 
because nazi leader adolf hitler issued a standing order to execute 
allied commandos linked to sabotage said rhode james 
were talking about murder coldblooded murder of a prisoner 
of war and that is a war crime rhodes james said it didnt 
happen in the heat of battle it was a coldblooded criminal act 
rhodes james headed waldheims private office from 197376 when 
waldheim elected president two years ago served as un 
secretarygeneral in new york 
waldheim has denied any role in executing allied prisoners when 
he served as an intelligence lieutenant for gen alexander lohrs 
army group e which committed many atrocities in the balkans 
rhodes james said waldheim 69 should be prosecuted 
i wouldnt particularly worry about a lowerranking person 
but waldheim was a former secretarygeneral to the un and is now 
head of state in austria rhodes james said 
in march 1986 it was revealed that waldheim was a german army 
lieutenant in the balkans from 1942 to 1945 after hitlers troops 
took control of austria 
the world jewish congress has accused waldheim of massacres of 
yugoslav and greek civilians and partisans as well as deportation 
of greek jews to nazi death camps he was also accused of 
involvement in a slaughter of about 70000 people at the yugoslav 
town of kozarra in 1942 
waldheim has denied these accusations 
even so the debate over his war past has badly marred relations 
between austria and israel and frayed austrias ties with the 
united states and britain as well the us justice department in 
1987 placed waldheim on its list of aliens prohibited from entering 
the united states 
the australianborn warren belonged to the clandestine special 
operations executive but wore his regular army uniform while 
leading an escape attempt of allied prisoners of war across greece 
rhodes james said 
the uniform entitled the captured officer to be treated as an 
ordinary pow rhodes james said but he charged that waldheim 
interrogated the prisoner and signed the report declaring him a 
saboteur a firing squad executed warren on may 15 1944 
rhodes james said his charges stem from conversations with 
christopher montague woodhouse a historian and former member of 
parliament who ran allied operations in greece from 1943 to 1945 
woodhouses report on warren is to be published later this month 
in encounter magazine meanwhile woodhouse has refused to talk to 
the press 
rhodes james said he has not read the report but discussed its 
contents with woodhouse 71 now a professor of greek studies at 
kings college london

despite greater awareness of exercise and healthy 
foods many americans remain significantly overweight 
according to federal researchers who say most government 
nutritional goals are unlikely to be met 
everybody knows what is required to lose weight yet the 
prevalence of overweight doesnt seem to change much said dr 
marion nestle of the us office of disease prevention and health 
promotion in washington 
the national centers for disease control in its weekly report 
thursday reviewed the progress toward the governments 15 
toppriority goals for american nutrition in 1990 including 
raising public knowledge of the effects of salt and lowering 
average bloodcholesterol levels 
substantial progress has been made in several areas and 
three of the goals will be fully met researchers said 
but despite the progress americans will probably fall short of 
eight major goals including that of getting people to lose weight 
said ms nestle whose office helped prepare the report 
the research that relates poor diet to disease is now 
incontrovertible she said its really time now to start 
looking at ways to implement the recommendations that everybody is 
familiar with ways to improve the nutritional status of the 
population 
the goals that will likely not be met she said are 
having less than 10 percent of american men and 17 percent of 
american women over the significantly overweight level defined 
as more than 20 percent over desired weight 
theres just been little change on that through the years 
ms nestle said its still about onefourth of the country 
having 50 percent of the overweight population on a 
weightloss program combining diet and exercise the cdc said 
recent surveys show half the nations overweight people are indeed 
trying to lose weight but only half are using both diet and 
exercise 
cutting the average adult level of harmful serum cholesterol 
below the 200 count in a 197680 survey average cholesterol 
levels were 211 for women and 215 for men down from 214 and 217 in 
197174 that rate of decline is not as fast as it should be 
ms nestle said 
having at least threefourths of all mothers breastfeeding 
their babies at the time they leave the hospital a 1984 survey put 
the figure at 61 percent up from 45 percent in 1978 
having all packaged foods labeled with useful calorie and 
nutrient information such is the case in 55 percent of packaged 
foods up from 42 percent in 1978 ms nestle said 
including nutrition counseling in virtually all routine 
health contacts with health professionals a 1985 survey showed 
the figure at less than 30 percent the cdc noted 
elimination of cases where a childs growth is retarded 
because of nutritional deficiencies although the problem cannot be 
precisely measured it persists ms nestle said 
including nutrition education in the required school 
curriculum in all states by 1985 only 12 states had such a 
requirement the cdc said 
the three objectives that researchers think will be fully met 
she said are 
having more than 75 percent of the population aware of 
nutritional risks for conditions such as heart disease and high 
blood pressure fats and salt and tooth decay betweenmeal 
sweets awareness already runs as high as 90 percent in some 
categories the cdc report said 
having 90 percent of us adults aware that to lose weight 
they must eat fewer calories or increase physical activity or 
both the percentage was 73 in 1985 and is rising quickly ms 
nestle said 
implementation of a comprehensive national nutrition status 
monitoring system it is already in place the cdc reported

opposition leader cuauhtemoc cardenas who 
lost his bid to become mexicos president accused two election 
officials of manipulating vote results and asked the government to 
file charges against them 
cardenas claims he won the july 6 vote but results released by 
the federal electoral commission gave cardenas of the leftist 
national democratic front coalition 3112 percent of the vote 
carlos salinas de gortari the candidate of the governing 
institutional revolutionary party received 5036 percent the 
commission said 
the chamber of deputies sitting as the electoral college meets 
aug 1531 to review the results and formally declare a winner in 
the july 6 election 
on thursday cardenas asked the federal attorney generals 
office to file criminal charges against commission president manuel 
bartlett diaz and technical secretary fernando elias calles for 
hiding information on the electoral results from nearly half of 
the nations approximately 55000 voting stations 
bartlett also is interior minister 
the petition said the election commissions failure to release a 
breakdown of results from 24642 polling places within four days of 
the election was a flagrant violation of the federal electoral 
code 
a statement issued by the front said the commissions failure to 
release the results made it impossible for opposition candidates to 
log formal complaints of voting irregularities in those local 
districts 
the attorney general first must find cause for opening an 
investigation to determine whether criminal charges are warranted 
said cecilia corona a spokeswoman with the social democratic 
party which belongs to the front 
on aug 4 cardenas manuel clouthier of the national action 
party and rosario ibarra de piedra of the revolutionary workers 
party renewed their charges of widespread fraud and called for new 
elections if their demands to clarify results were not met 
clouthier the national action candidate has said the elections 
were so tainted by fraud it is difficult to determine who won 
clouthier received 1707 percent of the vote according to 
official results 
both cardenas and clouthier have announced protests for sunday 
evening the night before the electoral college goes into session 
meanwhile the ruling party announced thursday night it will 
hold a series of nationwide rallies on friday to defend salinas 
victory as part of a popular day of national victory 
the rallies of party supporters are being held to recognize 
the validity of the vote and the defense of the same a party 
statement said 
it also announced a series of demonstrations of workers 
students professionals and other party sectors leading up to sept

israels military chief of staff says his 
troops have already held drills to prepare for possible warfare 
with arab armies after the iraniraq war ends 
lt gen dan shomron the chief of staff said on israel 
television thursday his troops completed a maneuver based on the 
presumption that the war had ended and iraqi forces are free we 
also took syria into account 
iraq has sent ground forces to fight israel in three of the five 
wars the jewish state has fought since 1948 
shomron said his troops held the maneuvers two weeks before 
irans july 18 announcement that it was ready to accept a 
ceasefire with iraq 
this was because of an assessment of the situation shomron 
said wednesday night we knew this war was winding down 
the unmediated ceasefire announced monday is to take 
effect aug 20 
israel has monitored the war carefully believing the outcome 
has an important bearing on israels security and the future of the 
arabisraeli conflict 
military and intelligence officers said israel was safer while 
iran and iraq were fighting each other but they worried about 
israel becoming an eventual target for iraqi forces that were 
better trained as a result of the war 
while it will take iraq some time to recover from its losses 
after the 8yearold conflict in the longer run this will mean 
a bigger danger for israel reserve duty brig gen aharon 
levran a former intelligence officer told foreign reporters at a 
governmentsponsored briefing 
the gulf war appears to be ending and i dont add thank god 
israel will have to think about it and start preparing said 
levran an analyst at tel aviv universitys jaffee center for 
strategic studies 
levran said any future war between israel and syria will be 
much more costly more bloody than it has been in the past 
because damascus has significantly improved the quantity and 
quality of its military equipment 
he noted syria recently had developed chemical warheads for its 
surfacetosurface missiles 
also syria had doubled its number of ground forces from five to 
10 divisions and increased the number of tanks from 1700 to 4000 
since the 1973 golan heights war he said 
damascus also has obtained advanced weaponry from the soviet 
union and more than doubled the number of attack aircraft in its 
arsenal levran said he refused to give a figure 
on the other hand he said syrias military expenditures had 
forced it to cut back on the size and training of its ground forces

almost two years after the fact the story is 
out that president reagan proposed to a louisiana state senators 
wife for him 
i didnt think there was a chance he would do it said sen 
fritz windhorst a member of the louisiana delegation to the 
republican national convention 
it was obviously a onceinalifetime experience from more 
than one point of view said barbara turner who became mrs 
windhorst thanks in part to a gentle shove from the president 
turner said she and windhorst who had been dating for about 18 
months attended a luncheon in september 1986 for henson moore a 
republican candidate for the us senate 
in a line of wellwishers meeting reagan windhorst asked the 
president for the unique favor he said ill do it i never get 
to do good things like this windhorst recalled 
reagan said turner walked up to me took both of my hands 
and smiled at me broadly and said its been a long time since i 
proposed to anyone which took me aback 
turner said she was left speechless and looking devoid of any 
intelligence whatsoever he said i think you should marry the 
senator 
she said she remained silent before the president said honey 
say something say yes turner said she finally gasped a yes 
out and kind of wobbled off at that point 
reagan wrote the couple a congratulatory note after they were 
married nov 22 1986 windhorst said

the senate reacting to the pentagon bribery 
investigation placed new restrictions on defense consultants as it 
approved a 282 billion military budget bill designed to win 
president reagans approval 
if the proposal becomes law consultants will be required for 
the first time to spell out who hires them and whether they have 
potential conflicts of interests 
the sad fact is that there is nothing requiring consultants 
under contract to the pentagon to disclose conflicts of interest 
said sen carl levin dmich one of the cosponsors of the 
proposal approved thursday 
the amendment was adopted on a voice vote shortly before the 
senate approved the 282 billion bill on a 904 vote 
levins proposal arose in the wake of the pentagon bribery case 
which involves allegations that private consultants many of them 
former pentagon employes paid current defense department employees 
for inside details about future contracts no charges have yet been 
filed 
sen david pryor dark a cosponsor of the proposal said the 
registration is needed because we need some mechanism for finding 
out who these people are working for and whether theyre working 
both sides of the street 
sen bennett johnston dla agreed saying this is an 
increasingly large problem 
the senate also added an amendment intended to send a message to 
us allies in japan and western europe that they should do more to 
pay for allied defense 
the votes came shortly before the senate passed the bill and 
followed by one week reagans veto of the first congressional 
attempt to pass a pentagon budget 
reagan vetoed that bill because he didnt like its restrictions 
on arms control policy or its deep cuts into his proposal for star 
wars spending the measure passed thursday includes the star wars 
reductions but none of the arms control limitations 
reagan rejected the bill authorizing the pentagon budget which 
is the first half of the congressional budget process a second 
measure is needed to appropriate money for the authorized projects 
and thursdays bill was the appropriation measure 
when congress returns after labor day from its recess a 
housesenate conference committee will meet to resolve differences 
between the measures approved by each chamber 
the house approved its defense appropriation bill two months ago 
and it doesnt contain either of the amendments approved thursday 
by the senate although both chambers are controlled by democrats 
reagans military budget generally fared better in the house than 
the senate 
the senates burdensharing amendment orders a major review 
of us overseas commitments limits the deployment of american 
troops to japan and south korea and sets a limit on spending for 
us military personnel stationed overseas the last provision 
requires the allies to pay the difference if deployment costs of 
us troops rise above 1988 levels 
the senate rejected 5936 another provision which proposed a 
10 percent reduction in the number of us military dependents 
living overseas 
in the past year both democrats and republicans on capitol hill 
have complained that us allies should pay more for allied 
defenses japan in particular has been a prime target of such 
criticism 
voting against the spending bill were sens kent conrad dnd 
mark hatfield rore claiborne pell dri and william 
proxmire dwis not voting were sens joseph biden ddel thad

israeli soldiers opened fire today on three 
palestinians who attacked them with chains clubs and an ax in a 
predawn fight the army said one palestinian was killed and 
another was wounded in the leg 
the clash took place shortly after midnight at the mughazi 
refugee camp in the gaza strip said an army spokesman who was not 
identified in keeping with military regulations 
israel radio identified the dead man as riad suleiman abu 
mandil 23 army officials said he had participated in antiisraeli 
demonstrations and attacks on soldiers in the past 
israeli sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the man 
ran from the army patrol after being wounded and may have bled to 
death an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of 
death 
the third member of the palestinian group was arrested said the 
sources they suggested the group may have been painting slogans on 
walls and were surprised by the israeli squad 
the death brought to 240 the number of palestinians killed since 
the uprising began dec 8 four israelis have died 
meanwhile the leaders of israels two major political parties 
intensified debate on the future of the west bank and gaza strip 
following jordanian king husseins decision to cut ties with the 
occupied lands 
in an interview with armed forces radio foreign minister shimon 
peres said israel must decide in nov 1 elections to pursue peace 
before arguing over who israels negotiating partner will be in 
peace talks 
what does israel want to take a peace initiative or to sit 
idly and let the arabs and the russians and the whole world run our 
affairs if we do not take the initiative and thats actually what 
the likud bloc proposes others will take it warned peres the 
head of the liberal labor party 
peres indicated he still believed that jordan had to be a 
negotiating partner even though hussein has declared he would not 
bargain on behalf of the palestinians 
we have always thought we should conduct negotiations both 
with jordan and the palestinians as jordan is responsible for the 
main border and the palestinians are those who bear the main burden 
of the palestinian problem 
we cant run away from facts what does jordan want war or 
peace that is the question said peres 
in an interview with the jerusalem post daily likuds industry 
minister ariel sharon argued the only realistic policy was to 
consider jordan a palestinian state since most of its 35 million 
people are palestinian 
the only thing to which we have to object in the strongest 
possible way is attempts to foist on us a second palestinian state 
to our east said sharon 
sharon who has a wide following among israels hardliners 
proposed that israel annex portions of the west bank and gaza 
strip he said there was a consensus that much of the territory was 
needed for security reasons 
prime minister yitzhak shamir leader of likud earlier this 
week ruled out annexation 
shamir said in a speech to the national defense college that the 
status of the territories could be decided only in talks with 
palestinians not affiliated with the plo which israel regards as a 
terrorist organization 
we honor our international obligations and we shall not make 
any unilateral step like imposing israeli rule on the territories 
that are subject to negotiations shamir said thursday 
his reference was to the usmediated camp david accords 
reached by israel and egypt in 1978 which call for five years of 
autonomy for palestinians before negotiations on the final status 
of land captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war

a longdebated experiment to distribute free 
clean needles to 200 drug addicts in an effort to slow the spread 
of aids has been judged legal and will begin soon the citys 
health commissioner said 
dr stephen c joseph said in an interview published in todays 
new york times that the experiment is expected to begin in about 10 
weeks 
needles are already distributed in several other countries but 
despite nationwide debate no government agency has yet done so in 
the united states 
if new yorks startup program is successful officials hope to 
broaden the distribution among the citys estimated 200000 
intravenous drugabusers sample blood tests indicate about half 
that group are already infected with the aids virus 
the experiment was approved this week by the state health 
department and local prosecutors have judged it to be legal the 
times said 
critics of the needles plan including some prosecutors and 
black officials contend it will promote illicit drug abuse 
the end is commendable of course said manhattan borough 
president david n dinkins a black who is against the plan but 
i maintain that drug use is unacceptable and i do not accept the 
notion that we can make drugs safer 
in new york city needle use has become the leading method of 
infection for new aids cases 
the 200 people to receive needles will be chosen from waiting 
lists of addicts seeking drug treatment another 200 will be chosen 
as a control group they will not receive needles but their drug 
behavior and aids infection will be monitored 
anyone who receives free needles will be required to turn in 
used ones each time they get another to prevent improper 
distribution of the needles

a man who was once a teenage prostitute has 
been charged with running an eightyearold sex ring that sold the 
services of hundreds of boys sometimes flying them to other 
cities police said 
accused ringleader wesley david gonzalez 26 earned a living 
from prostitution from age 12 to 16 eventually giving it up to 
start the pedophile ring eight years ago said detective robert 
sheehan 
the tampabased operation came to light when the parents of an 
11yearold contacted police after wondering how their son got 
large amounts of cash 
a fourmonth probe led to the arrests of gonzalez and two other 
floridians in june police disclosed wednesday the investigation 
continues and authorities say they expect more arrests in other 
cities 
for eight years the network sent boys to atlanta denver 
boston indianapolis and chicago to meet adult clients said tampa 
sgt ronald j reynolds 
gonzalez an unemployed avionics technician understood the 
psyche of the boys he hired most of them from poor families and 
broken homes because he was once one of them sheehan said he 
used boys to recruit others flashing wads of cash as a lure 
sheehan said 
a lot of the kids despised the sex but the financial 
inducements were too enticing to the youngsters said sheehan 
the underground child prostitution operation involved hundreds 
of youths ages 11 to 16 who earned from 300 to 700 for a single 
meeting police said 
getting the boys to admit their activities was difficult because 
of a quiet bond between them and officials said that slowed the 
investigation 
the members loyalty stood even when faced with prison 
sheehan said 
gonzalez also known as michael david gonzalez was arrested in 
june on a tampa warrant charging him with capital sexual battery 
procuring children under 16 for prostitution and deriving financial 
support from prostitution according to sheehan he is being held 
without bond 
the others arrested were identified as car salesman larry 
gorman 38 and michael leroy johnson 30 who works for a paint 
company johnson was charged with lewd and lascivious acts with a 
child gorman was charged with performing a sexual act with a 
child both were released on bond

a political truce during the olympics and warned that violent 
protests would expose the country to worldwide scorn 
roh condemned demonstrations by radical students and said 
dissident groups were trying to spoil the mood before the sept 17 
start of the olympic games in seoul he appealed to opposition 
leaders to support the government in curbing unrest 
an eruption of demonstrations involving firebombs stones and 
tear gas during the olympics would disrupt the olympics and our 
nation would become an object of worldwide scorn roh told a 
meeting reviewing olympic preparations 
later radical students battled riot police with firebombs and 
rocks at least three campuses in seoul after rallies to prepare for 
a march monday to the border for reunification talks with north 
korean students 
riot police fired tear gas to drive students back eyewitnesses 
reported some arrests and injuries but police refused to give any 
figures 
national police headquarters in seoul said today that 2099 
radicals were detained the previous two days for taking part in 
demonstrations to support the monday march which the government 
has prohibited all but 243 students were released 
police officials said 13 police stations were attacked by 
students nationwide this week and several dozen officers were 
injured 
radical students have staged scattered protests in seoul and 
other cities to prepare for the march and fought riot police in 
minor confrontations in some places turnouts at rallies during the 
past five days have been low 
a similar march june 10 for talks with north korean student 
delegates was blocked by riot police support for the latest march 
appears to be low because of public opposition a summer heat wave 
and college vacations 
also today assembly speaker kim chaesun suggested that 
delegates from north and south korea meet at panmunjom next friday 
to discuss the possibility of a northsouth parliamentary meeting 
the north has proposed the discussion be held wednesday 
south koreas national assembly made its counterproposal in a 
letter delivered to north korea through the truce village of 
panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone 
in a letter sent to south korea on tuesday north korea said the 
working meeting if held should discuss only logistical 
arrangements for full parliamentary talks which it hopes would be 
held before the end of this month 
radical students have seized on the reunification issue to try 
to mobilize public support for their antigovernment campaign the 
students a small but vocal minority on college campuses have 
failed to gain support because of their violent tactics and open 
advances to the communist north 
the peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of world 
war ii north korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the korean 
war 
the north is demanding that seoul to let it be a cohost at the 
games but the international olympic committee has said the 
olympics cannot be shared 
as a result north korea said it will boycott the event 
south korea today welcomed the international olympic committees 
latest attempt to persuade north korea to change its mind 
on thursday ioc president juan antonio samaranch proposed that 
the north and south korean teams could march side by side in the 
opening and closing ceremonies each carrying its own flag while a 
single olympic flag preceded the overall korean group 
he said north korean participation would demonstrate its 
strong desire for dialogue and reconciliation 
we are still very anxious to have their participation said 
shin hyonung director general of international press for the 
seoul olympic organizing committee 
if north korea accepts the ioc offer it would be a very good 
idea to march in parallel with north korea in the opening 
ceremony shin said

relatives of people who died in the worlds worst 
singleplane accident today marked the third anniversary of the 
disaster by visiting the mountain where the jumbo jet crashed 
about 120 relatives and 30 officials of japan air lines 
including president susumu yamachi attended a ceremony in heavy 
rain in uenomura 80 miles northwest of tokyo 
on aug 12 1985 a japan air lines boeing 747 en route to osaka 
from tokyo crashed and killed all but four of 524 people on board 
organizers of victims family groups said claims for compensation 
from jal and the seattlebased boeing co have been hindered 
because of the number of people involved in two countries 
it was the worst airplane accident the world has ever seen 
and the aftermath of the accident is highly complicated because the 
case intertwines interests of more than one country and over 
thousands of people said kuniko miyajima an organizer of 
bereaved families 
the ministry of transport last year concluded that faulty repair 
work by boeing and poor maintenance by jal after a previous mishap 
led to the rupture of a rear cabin wall on the aircraft which 
caused the crash 
in 1979 the jumbo jet suffered a damaged bulkhead when it 
skidded on its tail during a rough landing at osaka international 
airport 
so far families of 334 victims have reached settlement with jal 
and boeing co according to jal officials 
most families of the remaining victims are either proceeding 
with suits against jal and boeing or individually negotiating with 
the companies through lawyers according to miyajima 
terms of compensation have not been disclosed either by the 
companies or lawyers of the families of the victims however 
sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said the cost 
will be shared by the two companies with 175 percent paid by jal 
and 825 percent by boeing 
both jal and boeing have admitted liability for the crash and 
have reportedly offered about 100000 to 135000 compensation for 
each victim but miyajima said she is not satisfied with the offer 
judging from cruelty of the accident and the pain which 
bereaved people have to go through our feeling is that victims 
deserve at least more than what automobile accident victims get 
said miyajima who lost her 9 yearold son in the crash 
they have to consider that passengers were exposed to an 
extreme degree of fear for half an hour while the aircraft was 
flying in the air without control before crashing she said 
she also said about 30 bereaved relatives of the victims are 
refusing even to negotiate because they cannot get over the pain 
of facing the agony of losing their beloved ones every time they 
sit at a negotiation table and discuss the accident

former gov evan mecham says a lawsuit 
seeking to wrest an 80000 protocal fund from him is frivolous 
and he expects to win a court fight over the money which was 
central to his impeachment conviction 
the state of arizona brought suit against mecham on thursday 
aimed at forcing him to give the money to gov rose mofford the 
democrat who succeeded mecham when he was convicted on impeachment 
charges april 4 
mecham however told reporters that he mailed the money back to 
the original 687 contributors thursday 
valley national bank spokesman steve roman said the bank will 
not pay on the checks until a court decides who is entitled to the 
money 
mecham called the lawsuit one of the biggest travesties of a 
waste of taxpayers money on a frivolous lawsuit ive ever seen 
he predicted the court would declare the fund to be private 
money thus proving the senate had no grounds to convict him of 
misusing 80000 from the fund by loaning it to his auto 
dealership mecham also was convicted of trying to thwart a probe 
of an alleged death threat 
attorney general bob corbin who filed the civil suit said he 
believes the protocol fund belongs to the state corbin 
unsuccessfully prosecuted mecham in criminal court in may on 
charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
the lawsuit asks that mecham be forced to give the state all the 
money remaining in the account as of april 5 the day after he was 
removed from office 
corbin and mrs mofford decided to sue after mecham rejected a 
state offer that would have allowed him to return the money to the 
donors after providing a full accounting of the funds and asking 
the contributors if they wanted to give the money to charity 
weve made an offer to him he rejected it corbin said 
thats still on the table 
the protocol fund at one time totaled about 92000 but mecham 
has said some of the money was spent on state purposes 
the fund was created with receipts from mechams january 1987 
inaugural ball and mecham originally intended to use the receipts 
to help repay his campaign debt but questions were raised about 
whether the inaugural fund raising complied with arizonas campaign 
finance law and the money was converted to a protocol fund in june 
1987 in an agreement with the maricopa county attorneys office 
that agreement signed by mecham inaugural committee chairman 
bill long said the money was to be used solely for purposes of 
promoting the interests of the state or to promote and encourage 
citizen public service to the state 
but mecham has contended he was unaware of the agreement and is 
not bound by it 
the lawsuit said mecham has for financial gain knowingly 
exercised control over the protocol fund with the intent to deprive 
the office of the governor of control of those funds

a confidential source whose identification by 
the star tribune resulted in a jury verdict against the newspaper 
has prompted new guidelines at the newspaper on using anonymous 
sources 
in a front page announcement thursday the newspaper described 
the new guidelines to its readers 
we know that some readers are concerned about recent questions 
involving the use of anonymous sources in the star tribune so are 
we and were taking action to deal with those questions star 
tribune executive editor joel kramer wrote 
the announcement follows a verdict granting damages to a public 
relations man who gave the paper and other news organizations 
information about a political opponents shoplifting charge six 
days before a 1982 election he gave the information on condition 
he would remain anonymous and claimed in his suit that 
identification of him by the star tribune and the st paul pioneer 
press dispatch hurt his career 
kramer also said a recent star tribune article on the university 
of minnesota hospital that reported on alleged wrongdoing on the 
basis of anonymous sources who didnt have firsthand knowledge to 
support their account illustrated the risks to fairness and 
accuracy that can result from use of anonymous sources 
in a third recent incident the star tribune recalled all 
640000 copies of its sunday magazine scheduled to appear one 
weekend because kramer said a person quoted by name in the 
magazine said she had been promised anonymity 
the guidelines make three main points kramer said 
while anonymous sources are a critical element of some 
important stories frequent reliance on them increases the risk of 
inaccurate or unfair journalism and can adversely affect the 
newspapers credibility with readers 
anonymous statements and quotes should be published only when 
necessary to provide important information and only after both a 
reporter and editor are satisfied that the paper is meeting its 
standards for accuracy and fairness 
promises of confidentiality to sources that are not in the 
newspapers or the readers best interests should be avoided but 
once made will be honored except in the most extraordinary 
circumstances 
kramer said the guidelines replace the mostly unwritten 
guidelines and standards weve relied on before 
on july 22 a hennepin county district court jury found that the 
star tribune and the pioneer press dispatch broke a contract by 
identifying dan cohen as a confidential source for a story and must 
pay him a total of 700000 in damages the newspapers are 
appealing the verdict 
reporters for the two newspapers who separately accepted court 
documents from cohen on condition his identity not be revealed 
were overruled by their editors who decided to name cohen 
kramer said that under the new guidelines a reporter should 
not promise anonymity in a situation similar to cohens but if the 
reporter makes such a promise the editors will honor it

seven out of 10 american voters think the united 
states can trust the soviet union enough to sign a treaty 
eliminating most of both nations nuclear weapons by the turn of 
the century according to a poll 
such developments as the reagangorbachev summits and the soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan are eroding americans longstanding 
mistrust of the soviet union pollster daniel yankelovich said 
thursday 
but he said six in 10 voters still regard the soviet union as 
a serious threat to the united states and more than a third 
trust the soviets not at all 
the poll was one of several commissioned for americans talk 
security a series of surveys on national defense and security 
issues financed by boston businessman alan f kay 
in telephone interviews with 1000 registered voters 
yankelovichs firm found a majority trusted the soviets enough to 
believe that the united states and the soviet union could 
sign a treaty to eliminate most nuclear weapons by the year 
2000 71 percent 
work together to stop illicit drug trafficking 85 percent 
halt environmental pollution 85 percent fight terrorism 78 
percent resolve conflicts in the mideast and other trouble spots 
72 percent 
expand cultural exchanges 84 percent 
the survey taken in july shortly after the moscow summit noted 
a 7 percent increase to 68 percent from march in american 
voters belief that relations with the soviets are improving 
but yankelovich also noted a persistent strain of mistrust 
toward the soviet union with 60 percent describing it as a major 
threat to the united states down from 76 percent before gorbachev 
took office 
only 36 percent thought the united states should sell 
nonmilitary high technology to the soviets 34 percent would stop 
work on reagans strategic defense initiative as part of a nuclear 
arms agreement 28 percent favored sharing sdi technology with the 
soviets as it is developed 
women without a college education were far more mistrustful of 
the soviets and gorbachev than similarly educated men or 
collegeeducated men and women a finding which democratic pollster 
john marttila said flies somewhat in the face of conventional 
wisdom 
although 37 percent of all voters said they trusted the soviet 
union not at all 43 percent of women took that stand compared 
with only 30 percent of men 
referring to vice president george bushs gender gap 
republican pollster frank mcbride said this information is 
something the vice president can use in his campaign 
the poll has a margin of error of 3 percent

a man who says he witnessed the downing of 
george bushs navy bomber during world war ii has challenged the 
vice presidents contention that the aircraft was on fire when he 
bailed out leaving behind two crew mates who were presumed dead 
the new york post reported today 
chester mierzejewski 68 of cheshire conn said in interviews 
with the post that the plane was not engulfed in flames as bush 
has claimed and that bush could have made a water landing and 
possibly saved the lives of the two men 
i think he bush could have saved those lives if they were 
alive mierzejewski told the newspaper i dont know that they 
were but at least they had a chance if he had attempted a water 
landing 
bush has referred to the sept 2 1944 downing in the 
presidential campaign this year and described it in detail in 
interviews and in his autobiography 
describing the scene in his book bush wrote his aircraft was 
hit on a diving run to bomb a japanese radio installation in the 
south pacifics bonin islands 
smoke poured into the cockpit and i could see flames rippling 
across the crease of the wing edging toward the fuel tanks bush 
wrote he said he finished dropping the bombs and then losing 
control of his plane ejected over the ocean after radioing his 
gunner and radioman to jump and getting no response 
in a television interview aired last december bush described 
the ordeal as about as close as you get to death the plane 
was in smoke and the wings were burning he said 
mierzejewski who was the turret gunner in the tail of squadron 
commander douglas melvins plane which led the tight formation 
bombing raid disagreed 
he said he was about 100 feet ahead of bushs plane and saw 
only a puff of smoke which quickly dissipated there was no 
more smoke he said and he insists bushs plane was never on 
fire and that no smoke came out of his cockpit when he opened 
his canopy to bail out 
the intelligence report on the loss of bushs plane reports that 
smoke and flame engulfed bushs engine according to the post 
the report was signed by melvin and an intelligence officer now 
deceased 
squadron members interviewed by the post disagreed about whether 
mierzejewski would have had the best line of sight on bushs plane 
and mierzejewski was the only one to claim he saw the plane downed 
mierzejewski said that after bush was rescued and returned to 
their aircraft carrier 30 days later bush approached mierzejewski 
and he said ski im sure those two men were dead i called 
them on the radio three times they were dead 
he seemed distraught he was trying to assure me he did the 
best he could im thinking what am i going to say to him i have 
to give him the benefit of the doubt 
mierzejewski said he wrote bush this march to tell him his 
public descriptions were entirely different from my recall of the 
incident but did not hear back from the vice president 
steve hart bushs press secretary told the post thursday that 
bush has told us time and time again what happened that day to 
suggest that his account is inaccurate is absurd

the iranian embassy indicated it would help in the 
search for foreign hostages in lebanon if britain continues efforts 
to find four iranians believed held in lebanon 
british diplomat david reddaway arrived in tehran today for 
talks about the hostages it is britains first diplomatic visit to 
iran in a year 
those developments along with meetings in london between an 
iranian envoy and archbishop of canterbury robert runcie raised 
new hopes for the release of the three britons held hostage in 
lebanon 
i think it is bound to help reddaway a senior official at 
the british foreign ministry said of his tehran visit speaking 
before leaving from heathrow airport he said that while in iran he 
planned to assess the possibility of britain resuming diplomatic 
ties 
britain withdrew its diplomats from iran a year ago after one 
was beaten up in apparent reprisal for the arrest of an iranian 
envoy in england on shoplifting charges 
neither the iranian embassy nor runcie who left for a 
threeweek vacation in philadelphia would comment on runcies 
wednesday night talks with mohamed reza said mohamedi an iranian 
foreign ministry official 
runcie is the spiritual head of the church of england church 
envoy terry waite is among the three british hostages 
an anglican bishop went to lebanon last month to initiate 
inquiries about the fate of four iranians believed kidnapped by 
christians in lebanon 
a statement from the iranian embassy released thursday night 
said 
1 any attempt in locating the iranian hostages in lebanon 
would be appreciated by the entire people of iran 
2 we are sincerely exploring the possibilities and ways of 
mutual assistance in tracing noniranian hostages in lebanon 
3 we fully share the views expressed by the archbishop of 
canterbury and appreciate his initiatives in solving this problem 
proiranian extremists are believed to hold 18 foreigners 
including nine americans hostage in lebanon the hezbollah 
faction over which the iranian government wields considerable 
influence is believed to be the umbrella organization for groups 
holding the hostages 
waite disappeared in lebanon in january 1987 while trying to 
secure the release of hostages 
the other britons missing are television journalist john 
mccarthy who was kidnapped april 17 1986 and teacher brian 
keenan from northern ireland who has been missing since april 11 
1986 keenan holds british and irish nationality 
the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 
161985 
the foreign office said the catalyst for sending a diplomat to 
tehran was irans agreement july 18 to accept a un ceasefire in 
its war with iraq 
a british broadcasting corp middle east correspondent keith 
graves reported that the agreement had led to control of the 
hostages being passed from hezbollah to a group of hardline 
iranian revolutionary guards 
graves said the hardliners opposed hashemi rafsanjani head of 
irans armed forces because of his agreement to a ceasefire and 
his willingness to have the foreign hostages released from 
lebanon

antiapartheid groups oppose plans 
to build a new port terminal here unless the coal importer pushing 
the idea embargoes south african coal but high unemployment is 
making the project hard to turn down 
about 44 percent of the 107 million tons of coal shipped 
through rotterdam the worlds biggest port come from south 
africa according to city government statistics 
the frans swarttouw company which claims to handle a third of 
rotterdams coal import business wants to build a 467 million 
coal terminal rotterdam city officials are debating whether to 
invest 57 million in new roads docks and other construction works 
that would go up around the terminal 
the projects could help curb the citys 25 percent unemployment 
the kairos antiapartheid group wants approval of the 57 
million investment contingent on a swarttouw promise not to handle 
any south african coal 
the handling of south african coal is a serious stain on the 
port of rotterdam kairos wrote in a recent letter to city hall 
transshipment here helps shippers to conceal the coals south 
african origin 
according to kairos large amounts of south african coal are 
being shipped from rotterdam to nations that have embargoed south 
african coal 
the leftwing labor party which holds a 24seat majority in the 
45seat city council said in its 1986 election platform that the 
port of rotterdam may not be abused for the import of products 
from south africa particularly coal 
swarttouws general director hans sjouke conceded thursday 
that about a third of the coal handled by swarttouw is of south 
african origin but said if you want to impose a boycott of 
south african coal i think you want to talk to the consumers at 
the end of the line 
most of the coal imported via rotterdam is used by electric 
power stations in the netherlands and other european nations 
the new terminal scheduled for completion in 1998 has been 
designed to handle coal carriers of up to 250000 tons in line 
with a current trend toward the use of larger vessels sjouke said 
in a telephone interview 
there is strong public and official disapproval in the 
netherlands of apartheid south africas system of racial 
segregation the dutch government supports tougher sanctions 
against south africa by the 12 member nations of the european 
economic community but refuses to impose a south african coal 
import ban until all 12 eec members agree to do the same 
france and denmark are the only two eec member nations that have 
imposed such an embargo along with the united states

a new study finds that most elderly patients who 
survived one lifethreatening illness would submit to intensive 
care a second time but doctors say that finding leads to serious 
questions about the use of resources 
we undertook this study to help doctors deal with one dilemma 
when to use lifesustaining treatment and weve come up with 
another said dr marion danis one of the authors of the study 
published in todays journal of the american medical association 
the subjects of the study were 160 people 55 or older who were 
admitted to intensive care at north carolina memorial hospital in 
chapel hill for at least 24 hours during 1983 the authors said 
of those interviewed 74 percent later reported they would be 
completely willing to undergo intensive care again to prolong 
survival for any period even as brief as one month the study said 
four percent said they were unwilling to undergo more intensive 
care for any period of the remaining 22 percent most expressed 
varying preferences depending on duration of survival 
the patients in our study are saying they want to receive 
highly technical care under almost any condition as late as the 
last month of their life ms danis of the university of north 
carolina at chapel hill said thursday 
and our society is going to have to think about whats the 
most appropriate use of our medicalcare resources it may turn out 
that these are wishes that will prove very difficult to fill 
the patients preferences appeared to hold true regardless of 
quality of life life expectancy age severity of illness length 
of stay or intensivecare cost the study found 
families surveyed on behalf of patients who had died or been 
left incompetent after intensivecare treatment felt the same way 
indicating the feeling did not depend on successful treatment 
you have to recognize the limitations of the study ms 
danis said the patients who provided our subjects already had 
shown a willingess to undergo intensivecare treatment in the face 
of one lifethreatening illness but that could also be one of its 
strengths 
many times doctors face lifesustaining decisions without any 
input from the patients this study informs physicians about the 
opinions of patients whove been in that spot 
but one researcher questioned the finding that quality of life 
concerns had just a small impact on patient preference 
in an editorial accompanying the study nancy r zweibel of the 
university of chicagos department of medicine said the study 
dealt with qualityoflife considerations only in a general way 
evidence suggests that when faced with such decisions 
patients consider a number of more concrete factors such as the 
presence and level of longterm pain likelihood of getting better 
ability for selfcare and mobility ability to think straight and 
burden on family said ms zweibel a researcher in social policy 
and aging

sea lions along the west coast are being 
stricken by a disease that is contagious to humans and a marine 
expert is warning people not to approach the ailing creatures that 
may be found on beaches 
more than 40 sick or dying animals infected with the the 
microorganism leptospira have been found on beaches this summer 
said peigin barrett executive director of the marine mammal center 
in marin county 
leptospirosis last hit the california sea lion population in 
1984 killing as many as 10000 of the animals barret said the 
microorganisms invade the kidneys and liver and warned that humans 
should not approach the creatures if they are found on a beach 
we want to make sure people stay away from stricken animals 
barrett said we have really serious concern for both animals and 
people 
mary jane schramm of the marine mammal center in sausalito said 
news about the disease had sparked a mild panic among fishermen 
surfers and others who frequent beaches however she said even 
those who handle sea lions for a living are unlikely to contract 
the disease were not that worried about it she said 
theres no cause for alarm for leptospirosis in california sea 
lions denize springer assistant to the executive director of 
the mammal center said thursday 
the ailing sea lions are being treated with tetracycline but 
the mortality rate is 39 percent barrett said 
initial reports of ailing sea lions began in early june barrett 
said that through wednesday center volunteers had responded to 43 
cases with a current rate of two a day when the animals get too 
weak to swim they come ashore barrett said the animals have been 
found from san luis obispo to the oregon boundary 
scientists are puzzled by both the cause of the disease and its 
present occurrence since the epidemic seems to strike every 10 
years barrett said

camp was located told rude pravo that 2400 documents provide 
evidence of maloths crimes

execution squads novak told rude pravo

observatorys satellite dishes worth millions for 500 was 
obviously a prank to everyone but the reader who called up to buy 
five 
the ad taken out by four students who worked as summer 
employees at the observatory appeared in wednesdays albuquerque 
journal it read must go 28 used 82 ft satellite dishes hbo 
you bet 25 million new must leave state and said it would 
sell them for 500 or or best offer 
rick perley an official with the national radio astronomy 
observatory whose name was listed in the ad for prospective buyers 
to call said one caller obviously thought it was the buy of a 
lifetime 
they wanted to reserve five of them perley said we dont 
know who the wouldbe buyer is the secretary who took the call 
hadnt seen the ad she didnt know what it was he was talking 
about 
it was just kind of a practical joke ed murphy who will be 
a senior at the university of illinois this fall said of why he 
and friends took out the ad we heard it had been done once 
before at an observatory in west virginia so we had the idea and 
decided to do it 
its very funny from their point of view perley said but 
we take our responsibility of having the publics money very 
seriously we cant possibly condone this we dont want people to 
think we dont do our jobs 
the observatorys very large array cost 78 million and began 
operating in 1980 most recently it was linked with radio dishes in 
california to receive signals from deepspace probe voyager 2 as it 
approaches neptune

south african foreign minister pik botha 
today held talks with us soviet and british diplomats on 
pretorias joining the nuclear nonproliferation treaty a south 
african diplomat said 
the talks took place at the us mission in vienna said a 
secretary at the mission who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the south african diplomat who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity said a series of bilateral meetings were planned along 
with the talks 
the south african broadcasting corp reported thursday that 
botha and south african energy minister danie steyn would convey 
their governments willingness to open its nuclear facilities to 
international inspection 
in the past south africa has refused to sign the 1969 nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty and to submit all its nuclear facilities 
to inspection by the viennabased international atomic energy 
agency 
south africa is widely believed to have the technical capability 
to produce an atomic bomb but there is debate about whether it 
actually has produced any 
the us delegation to the talks is headed by ambassador richard 
t kennedy and the soviet delegation led by moscows permanent 
representative to the international organization in vienna timer 
baev us officials said 
the british delegation is reportedly headed by under secretary 
john goulden botha and steyn arrived in vienna on thursday 
the international atomic energy agency has said it is not 
invloved in the discussions 
south africa has been under increasing pressure at the 
international atomic energy agency to submit its nuclear facilities 
to inspection 
african and other third world member countries have repeatedly 
attempted to have south africa ousted as a member largely because 
of apartheid the policy under which the nations 26 million blacks 
have no vote in national affairs 
at last years general assembly a decision on south africas 
expulsion was postponed after pretoria announced it was considering 
joining the treaty 
last month diplomats in vienna said they expected south africa 
to make a move before the next annual general assembly of the 
international atomic energy agency in september 
the united states the soviet union and britain are the three 
nuclear weapon states that have joined the treaty which so far 
has been signed by a total of 137 countries france and china two 
other countries with a known nuclear weapons potential are not 
signatory to the treaty 
under the treaty signatories pledge to submit their nuclear 
programs to agancy controls and the agencys inspectors must make 
sure material is not diverted to other than peaceful uses

the california supreme court has upheld the 
life sentence of a contractor convicted of murdering a man while 
planning a bizarre plot to take over marin county with guns and 
laser beams 
the justices voted unanimously on thursday not to grant a 
hearing on an appeal by mark richards who was convicted of killing 
richard baldwin in july 1982 while making plans for the 
paramilitary takeover of the county 
according to police richards originated the plot known as 
pendragon which involved blowing up bridges and taking control of 
marin county and seceding from the united states the plot was 
never attempted 
it came to light after baldwins death and did not result in any 
additional criminal charges 
authorities said richards and one of his young proteges crossan 
hoover entered baldwins garage where hoover hit baldwin in the 
head with a baseball bat 
richards owed baldwin money in his business and police said 
hoover was told he would be helping to solve richards financial 
problems hoovers murder conviction also has been upheld 
richards was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility 
of parole for the death of baldwin

president pw botha said 
today that a tough sanctions bill passed by the us house of 
representatives will not help south african blacks and might derail 
a regional peace initiative 
the recklessness of members of congress who do not care in the 
least whether their actions adversely affect the search for a 
peaceful solution to the problems of southern africa as a whole is 
astounding botha said 
he said the legislation which was forwarded to the senate after 
a vote thursday night might obstruct or make impossible an 
ongoing initiative to end south africas 73year rule over 
southwest africa also known as namibia 
the sanctions bill which still needs senate approval and 
president reagans signature to become law would halt us 
investment in south africa and impose a neartotal trade embargo 
it was approved by the house 244132 with most democrats 
supporting it and most republicans opposing it 
the bill faces a possible republican filibuster in the senate 
and a likely veto by reagan earlier legislation which passed 
despite reagans veto bars imports of various south african 
commodities and forbids south african planes to land at us 
airports 
botha said in a statement that the pending bill was being 
debated for purely internal political aims 
it the bill has no bearing on the promotion of the interests 
of black people in south africa he said the members of the 
house of representatives are by now fully aware that prominent 
black leaders in south africa as well as governments in certain 
neighboring states strongly oppose this legislation 
prominent black antiapartheid leaders in south africa 
including anglican archbishop desmond tutu have urged the west to 
impose tougher sanctions as a means of pressuring the government to 
grant full political rights to the black majority under pretorias 
policy of apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs 
many black moderates and conservatives as well as several 
prominent white liberals have supported pretorias contention that 
sanctions will have the harshest effect on blacks and will harden 
the white minoritys resistance to political change 
botha said he found it particularly remarkable that the 
house acted on the bill exactly at a time when positive progress 
was being made with the peace negotiations between south africa 
cuba and angola 
the three countries on monday announced a ceasefire in the 
13year angolan war south africa said it was prepared to start 
granting independence to namibia nov 1 as part of a un plan 
provided an agreement was reached later this month on a timetable 
for the withdrawal of cuban troops from angola 
an estimated 50000 cuban troops have been supporting angolas 
marxist government in its fight against the unita rebel movement 
unita which is backed by the united states and south africa is 
not a party to the ceasefire 
it would be ironical if the un independence plan for 
namibia should reach the point of implementation only to be 
obstructed or made impossible as a result of provisions in the 
american legislation botha said

floods have destroyed about 83000 homes in 
sudans capital of khartoum more than twice the number previously 
estimated the middle east news agency reported today 
the floods which hit over the weekend after torrential rains 
caused shortages of electricity drinking water and food in 
khartoum a city of 4 million residents at least 11 people were 
killed and sudanese prime minister sadek mahdi said 15 million 
people were left homeless 
the united nations said a lack of boats was hampering relief 
operations for people stranded on piles of rubble 
the egyptian stateowned news agency quoted an unidentified 
sudanese official as saying the floods destroyed 83240 houses in 
the khartoum area alone previous estimates ranged from 10000 to 
40000 
the new figure did not include the number of houses destroyed by 
floods in eastern and northern areas of the country 
cairo newspapers today said khartoum state television showed 
mahdi touring flooded areas in khartoum and complaining that tents 
food and medicine were not reaching flood victims fast enough he 
blamed lack of coordination among government agencies 
among those worst hit are southern refugees estimated at 
750000 to 1 million who fled a 5yearold civil war in the south 
and are living in canvas tin and mud huts on the outskirts of 
khartoum many of their flimsy shacks were washed away by flood 
waters 
sudanese officials blamed the floods on inadequate drainage 
systems last week khartoum and surrounding areas received 84 
inches of rain compared with 144 inches in all of 1987 
officials say the country faces more destruction from the annual 
flooding of the nile river in coming weeks they said the river 
level has risen dangerously after heavy rains in sudan and 
neighboring ethiopia whose rivers feed into the nile 
international aid has poured into khartoum from arab and west 
european countries but in geneva a senior un official said a 
lack of boats is hampering relief distribution 
the problem is how to reach people said hybad chowdhury 
senior officer at the un office of the disaster relief 
coordinator many have taken to high ground on piles of rubble 
you cant commission a lot of boats like in southeast asian 
countries 
about 2500 tents and 80000 blankets have been airlifted to 
sudan but more are needed he said cash aid by the international 
community so far totals 3 million 
no disease outbreaks have been reported despite the dangers of 
stagnant water which cannot drain into sudans nonporous soil he 
said 
in geneva the international red cross appealed today for more 
international aid to sudan 
national societies and governments have contributed more than 
100 tons of relief supplies including 1 million water purification 
tablets the red cross said cash contributions through the red 
cross totaled 840000

iran today denied it shelled iraqi military 
positions and president ali khamenei urged his forces to remain 
vigilant at the front 
also today a british diplomat arrived in tehran for talks about 
british and other foreign hostages held by proiranian groups in 
lebanon 
iraq on thursday accused iran of shelling iraqi military 
positions near the shatt alarab waterway where the persian gulf 
war broke out in september 1980 
but a spokesman for the war information headquarters in tehran 
denied the charge as false propaganda the official islamic 
republic news agency said 
the iraqi charge came in a statement issued by the iraqi mission 
at the united nations in new york it also came three days after 
un chief javier perez de cuellar said iran and iraq agreed to 
observe a formal ceasefire beginning aug 20 with direct peace 
talks to begin five days later in geneva 
according to the statement which was not carried in newscasts 
in iraq the iranian armed forces bombarded iraqi military 
positions with howitzer fire mortar shells and small missiles 
the iraqi statement reported no casualties and there was no 
independent confirmation of the attack 
earlier this week iran gave perez de cuellar a letter pledging 
it would not launch any attacks before the ceasefire begins 
iraq did not submit a similar letter but perez de cuellar has 
said he received assurances from both iran and iraq that they would 
exercise restraint 
khamenei in a prayer sermon at tehran university today urged 
his forces to remain at the war fronts for defense of iran tehran 
radio reported 
a throng of worshipers chanted down with the usa down 
with the soviet union and down with israel and pledged to 
obey revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the crowd was noticeably smaller than during a similar sermon 
attended by an associated press reporter four weeks earlier 
irna said british diplomat david reddaway arrived in tehran and 
planned talks on mutual relations during his stay in the 
iranian capital 
it did not elaborate but before leaving london reddaway said he 
would speak with officials about the 18 foreign hostages believed 
held by proiranian extremists in lebanon the hostage held longest 
is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press he was abducted march 16 1985 
britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by 
proiranian islamic fundamentalists anglican envoy terry waite 
journalist john mccarthy and teacher brian keenan a belfast man 
with dual british and irish nationality whose release is also 
sought by the irish government britain says it also seeks word on 
alec collett a new yorkbased british journalist whose palestinian 
abductors claim they killed him his body was never found 
iran has been making conciliatory statements about relations 
with western nations since it accepted on july 18 a un call for a 
ceasefire in the gulf war iraq accepted the resolution shortly 
after it was passed in july 1987 
a un factfinding team also arrived today in the iranian 
capital to investigate allegations of iraqs renewed use of 
chemical weapons irna said 
the iranian news agency said the fourmember team of chemical 
weapons experts would travel to the northwestern kurdish town of 
oshnaviyeh in the province of west azerbaijan 
iran alleges that a chemical weapon attack on the town earlier

american and soviet educators are learning 
new ways to teach students about each others country by grappling 
with such tough issues as the death penalty in an unusual program 
but the educators are also discovering how common their worries 
are 
i am struck by how much we are all in the same boat said 
alexander mitrofanovich bannov the principal of a secondary school 
in novosibirsk he is one of 40 teachers administrators and 
researchers at the twoweek program at hampshire college 
among the many problems the groups share he said were the 
evaluation of teachers and students and staff and the improving of 
education everybody says teachers should teach better as if a 
child was a pan into which you could pour information like water 
the program was planned by the academy of pedagogical sciences 
in the soviet union and educators for social responsibility a 
nonprofit us organization with 15000 members founded in 1981 
to help educators teach students a sense of social responsibility 
the purpose of the education summit is to share insights into 
the ways each country teaches its children about the other and to 
break through the propaganda for a better understanding of the two 
nations 
lessons about each others country are fraught with problems 
strong feelings misinformation deeply embedded assumptions and 
resistance to new information all related to tensions in 
ussoviet relations said lawrence dieringer associate 
director of educators for social responsibility 
the program opened tuesday with frank talks about how each group 
thought the other perceived it 
the soviets for example said they thought americans saw them 
as aggressors trying to take over the world dieringer said 
we thought that they thought there was a great disparity 
between the rich and poor in our country and that we dont care 
about the poor he said in many cases theres some kernel of 
truth in these stereotypes but they are so exaggerated that 
they serve to distort and limit our understanding of each other 
also on the agenda is an examination of each countrys 
textbooks a look at educational reforms in both countries and 
strategies for teaching controversial issues using human rights as 
case studies 
thursday the groups learned believing exercises a way of 
suspending judgment to understand other viewpoints before looking 
at them critically 
they were asked to make statements supporting the position that 
there are some crimes so horrible and so abusive that they demand 
capital punishment 
for many participants it was impossible to suspend their doubts 
about the death penalty enough to understand how others could 
support it 
this issue is so loaded for me that it comes up against my 
strongest bias said an american woman 
a soviet woman said she couldnt imagine this institution 
although the soviet union like many us states has a death 
penalty 
the idea for the gathering was laid out in a 1987 memorandum of 
cooperation between the academy and dieringers group he said the 
list of cooperative ventures also included working together on 
curriculum and exchanging articles that would be published 
unedited in each organizations respective journals 
a team of us educators visited the soviet union for a week 
last year to plan the program and a soviet team came to the united 
states in march for further planning the next institute on 
critical thinking will be held next summer in the soviet union

a federal prosecutor said his office and the fbi 
will investigate last weekends riot at a lower manhattan park to 
determine whether police violated federal civil rights laws 
as of thursday night 81 people had filed charges of police 
brutality with a city police review board 
us attorney rudolph giulianis office said in a statement 
thursday that it would conduct a preliminary review of the melee at 
tompkins square park to determine whether a formal investigation is 
warranted 
fiftytwo people were injured and seven were arrested during the 
riot at the park late saturday night and early sunday morning the 
incident began with a protest against police enforcement of a 1 
am park curfew 
meanwhile residents of the east village area planned a park 
cleanup followed by a march concert and rally protesting the 
violence the activities are expected to begin saturday morning and 
end around nightfall 
capt thomas fahey a police spokesman said if there is not 
an undue amount of people the plan is to have nine or 10 seasoned 
police officers enforce the noise laws and other laws inside the 
park if theres a lot of people were going to have to change our 
plans 
police commissioner benjamin ward has criticized the initial 
police response saying it lacked adequate planning and that 
tactical errors were made 
however a group representing 400 merchants sent a letter to 
ward defending the police saying they do not countenance the 
antisocial activities of drug addicts vagrants and anarchists 
and we demand and expect strong police response to such 
activities 
ward asked four members of the review board to investigate the 
brutality charges as well as the management and planning of the 
police at the scene 
the police probe also will investigate allegations that some 
officers covered their badges or took them off in violation of 
police policy

sein lwin first rose to prominence in 
burma by commanding an army company that shot and killed 22 
protesting students in a 1962 riot at rangoon university 
last march when thousands of students went on a rampage in some 
of the worst rioting in burmas history it again was sein lwin who 
led the forces that put them down 
analysts had suggested the 64yearold hardliner would be a 
logical scapegoat as the government of ne win his close ally 
sought to appease critics and stabilize the country 
instead sein lwin emerged last month as burmas most powerful 
leader succeeding ne win who resigned 
protests against his authoritarian rule intensified this week 
and troops shot and killed at least 95 demonstrators 
today sein lwin resigned as president and as chairman of the 
chairman of the burma socialist program party virtually the 
countrys sole political institution 
sein lwin joined the army in 1942 when burmese officers 
including ne win were siding with japan against the allies 
specifically britain which had colonized the onetime kingdom 
as the war progressed the officers switched allegiance to the 
allies realizing japan posed as much a threat to burmese 
independence as had the british independence from britain in 1948 
was followed by a chaotic 14year experiment with democracy 
that experiment ended in 1962 the year ne win seized power in a 
military coup and began to enforce his brand of economic socialism 
militarybacked authoritarian rule and isolation from much of the 
world 
that same year sein lwin led his army unit in quelling the 
protest at rangoon university firmly establishing his reputation 
as an unbending leader prepared to wield an iron fist to root out 
opposition 
little has been pubished about sein lwin and others in burmas 
senior hierarchy most of whom live secluded lives away from the 
public eye 
sein lwin retired from the army and in 1977 became a member of 
the partys guiding body the central executive committee he took 
the no 4 party slot of joint general secretary in 1985 
also in 1985 he was named secretary of the council of state 
the no 3 position in the government after president and vice 
president the 28member council directs all state organs 
he has also held ministerial portfolios for cooperatives 
transport communications and home affairs 
on march 18 in a day that was later dubbed bloody friday 
thousands of students stormed through downtown rangoon burning 
cars and shouting anti government slogans for the second time in 
three months 
the lon htein or riot police were called out reinforced 
by regular army units and armored vehicles according to western 
diplomatic and burmese sources sein lwin commanded the police from 
a tactical command headquarters at the government broadcast station 
sein lwin overruled some leaders who wanted to handle the riot 
more leniently the sources said the government has since admitted 
to 43 deaths but more than 100 people are believed to have been 
killed 
analysts among them the respected hong kongbased far eastern 
economic review had suggested sein lwin would take the fall for 
the violence which deepened antigovernment sentiments 
instead after he became president troops under his command 
again fired on demonstrators

the united states and south korea have 
agreed in principle to move us military installations from the 
center of the capital to help ease antiamerican sentiment 
government officials said today 
chief presidential spokesman lee soojung said senior officials 
from both countries have been discussing the matter since president 
roh taewoo took office in february 
roh personally raised the issue when he met with defense 
secretary frank carlucci and secretary of state george shultz in 
seoul in june and july lee said 
the us side agreed to consider the matter affirmatively and 
there have been a series of high and workinglevel talks between 
the two countries he said 
a government source here speaking on condition of anonymity 
said us ambassador james lilley and gen louis c menetrey 
commander of the us forces in south korea have been discussing 
the matter with south korean foreign minister choi kwangsoo and 
defense minister oh jabok 
the source said military facilities in the us compound would 
be relocated under long and shortterm programs depending on the 
sensitivity of military facilities involved 
he said some facilities used for nonmilitary purposes such as 
a golf course and a ball park would be taken over by south korea 
as soon as possible and converted into a public park 
although the two countries have no disagreement over the issue 
they still need to discuss details including moving costs that may 
run into billions of dollars a foreign ministry official said on 
condition of anonymity 
many south koreans have been demanding a relocation of the 
military facilities saing their location in the center of the city 
blocks development 
antius sentiment is high in south korea among radical college 
students who hold the united states resonsible for the partition of 
the korean peninsula at the end of world war ii in 1945 they

democrat michael dukakis said today that 
overspending by the reagan administration is to blame for 
interestrate increases that will raise the federal deficit 15 
billion and impose hardships on families farmers and businesses 
the democratic presidential nominee speaking to a breakfast 
gathering at the virginia governors mansion said interest rates 
would continue to rise if we continue to live on a credit card 
as we all know sooner or later the bill collector comes to 
the door dukakis said thats what happened yesterday in the 
united states of america 
he was referring to an increase in many banks prime lending 
rates 
dukakis has been criticized in virginia because he opposes 
construction of two new navy supercarrier task forces which would 
be built at the newport news va shipyard gov gerald l 
baliles who introduced dukakis said he disagreed with dukakis on 
that point but did not question his commitment to a strong national 
defense 
gov dukakis and i may debate the individual choices we must 
make but in his commitment to the security of this nation i have 
no doubts no reservations and no hesitations balile said 
also today dukakis aides said his campaign would run a 
oneminute advertisement this weekend in california and in the 
houston area the ad dukakis first since the primary campaign 
stresses his major themes such as economic revival and contains 
footage from his acceptance speech at the democratic national 
convention 
dukakis first blamed the administration for spurring the 
increase in the prime lending rate in remarks he made thursday 
after touring fort dix in new jersey 
a 10 percent prime rate its 3 in japan dukakis said at a 
rally in hartford conn why because we havent been able to pay 
our bills for eight years in washington dc 
dukakis blamed the soaring federal deficit on reagans failure 
to make tough choices on spending 
we have to say no to a lot of things wed like to say yes 
to dukakis said weve got to decide whether we want star wars 
or star schools in this country 
i think its regrettable he said i think its what 
happens after eight years of borrowing and spending borrowing and 
spending 
the massachusetts governor spent most of thursday trying to 
establish himself as a tough leader on military and foreign policy 
issues areas republicans frequently cite as dukakis greatest 
weaknesses 
dukakis toured fort dix where he had eight weeks of basic 
training after joining the army in 1955 earlier he delivered a 
speech in new york in which he said the country needed new 
leadership in the white house prepared to carefully manage the 
defense budget and negotiate further nuclear arms reductions with 
the soviet union 
deterrence requires vigilance and determination and 
leadership dukakis said but it does not require the seemingly 
endless development of new and more expensive nuclear weapons 
systems particularly when thanks to president reagan and 
secretary gorbachev we may have the best opportunity in our 
lifetime to build a safer world 
because of that progress dukakis said a greater share of the 
defense budget should be spent to improve conventional forces 
we need strong wellequipped welltrained conventional 
forces dukakis said after the tour of fort dix where he met 
with two men with whom he went through basic training 
he also said the military should be prepared to help with 
antiterrorism and antidrug operations 
we have to build strong military forces in this country based 
on sound planning and tough management not wishful thinking and 
blank checks he said criticizing expensive weapons systems 
favored by reagan and the current pentagon procurement scandal 
while in connecticut dukakis attended two fundraisers which 
raised well in excess of 500000 for the democratic national 
committees 1988 victory fund 
after a reception at the virginia governors mansion today 
dukakis was headed to jacksonville fla where aides said he would 
emphasize his commitment to antidrug efforts and criticize the 
reagan administration for cutting coast guard funding and other 
moves dukakis contends have undermined the war on drugs

world health officials today approved 
a strategy to promote better world health care by training doctors 
to emphasize disease prevention and to pass this knowledge along to 
their patients 
we want doctors everywhere to concentrate on how to keep 
people well rather than always be thinking of new ways to cure 
them when they fall ill said dr george miller of clinton ny 
a former head of the center for educational development at the 
university of illinois 
the world conference on medical education issued its declaration 
at the close of the fiveday conference today the document sets 
out principles to change and improve world health 
thousands suffer and die every day from diseases which are 
preventable curable or selfinflicted and millions have no ready 
access to health care of any kind said the declaration which 
was approved by 160 experts invited to the conference 
the aim of medical education is to produce doctors who will 
promote the health of all people not merely deliver curative 
services to those who can afford it or for those for whom it is 
readily available the declaration said 
it set out steps for the radical reform of medical education 
through cooperation with education and health ministries and 
community health services 
dr james grant executive director of the un childrens fund 
said it was now possible to improve dramatically the health of the 
next generation 
but he said parents were not being instructed on how to protect 
their children at small cost from the great scourges of disease 
including diarrhea measles tetanus whooping cough and acute 
respiratory infection 
he said these diseases account for more than twothirds of the 
14 million child deaths in the world each year 
grant said ways must be found to give people the knowledge to 
improve their own health 
dr hiroshi nakajima newly appointed directorgeneral of the 
world health organization told reporters that some countries had 
too many doctors trained in curative medicine when the real need 
was for disease prevention 
the conference was told that scots were turning to alternative 
medicine and setting up selfhelp groups because of dissatisfaction 
with doctors 
they are doing this because they feel they are not getting 
enough time or consideration or applied concern from their 
doctors said linda headland secretary of the scottish 
association of local health councils a liaison body of regional 
health authorities 
mrs headland said womens selfhelp groups were set up in 
scotland to try to reduce dependence on tranquilizers a problem 
they blamed in part on doctors who prescribed the drugs over long 
periods 
people want more information about their treatment and they 
want to be involved more in the decisions taken they want to be 
treated with a bit of dignity and respect she said 
henry walton a psychiatrist educator and president of the 
edinburghbased world federation for medical education which 
organized the conference said in an interview that too often 
doctors do not listen to their patients nor consider how to keep 
them fit 
they only think about them when they are ill medical 
education must extend to take care of people in the community in 
their homes and at work walton said 
he said there is a serious problem in some countries of too many 
doctors 
mexico for example has 1500 unemployed doctors and a union 
for unemployed doctors they are taxi drivers waiters mexico 
cant find the salaries to pay doctors whom they could well use 
walton said

a mental hospital holding john w hinckley jr 
today dropped its proposal to take the man who shot president 
reagan on a field trip as prosecutors turned up new writings by 
the presidential assailant 
dr raymond f patterson director of st elizabeths hospitals 
forensic services unit told a federal judge that the decision to 
drop the request was based on material received by the hospital 
thursday night 
reading a letter to us district judge barrington d parker 
patterson said the forensic services administration has 
determined that further clinical assessment by mr hinckleys 
treatment staff is necessary before it would permit him to 
participate in a daylong field trip 
comments by attorneys on both sides during the brief hearing 
indicated the material turned up by the secret service consisted of 
letters by hinckley to an unidentified third party 
us attorney jay b stephens asked parker to unseal the 
material which he said the secret service had obtained through an 
investigation defense lawyer vincent fuller described the material 
as letters written by hinckley 
parker refused to unseal the writings which were turned over to 
the court thursday until fuller could respond to the governments 
request they be made public the defense lawyer was given until 
tuesday to file a written objection 
outside the us courthouse stephens told reporters the 
writings should be made public because they relate to a matter of 
great national importance they relate to an individual who shot 
the president of the united states 
the public should be aware of what these materials are 
stephens said 
stephens indicated that the material turned up by the secret 
service were not known to st elizabeths officials until thursday 
night and was the basis for the hospitals decision to withdraw its 
request 
we provided materials to st elizabeths last night they 
withdrew their request for an offsite visit this morning 
stephens said 
the hospital decision was announced a day after federal 
prosecutors cited disturbing entries made this week in 
hinckleys psychiatric treatment record 
hinckley has been held at st elizabeths since he was acquitted 
by reason of insanity of charges he shot and wounded reagan 
presidential press secretary james s brady and two other men on 
march 30 1981 
brady remains confined to a wheelchair as a result of crippling 
injuries suffered during the shooting 
the hospital had not formally made known its plans but 
officials at the facility had indicated they want to take hinckley 
on a supervised outing such as a picnic or a bowling party 
according to court records 
stephens said in thursdays pleading that the latest treatment 
entries support the governments demand to review letters and 
writings seized from hinckleys room in april 1987 
the writings include correspondence with multiple murderer 
theodore bundy who is held on floridas death row hospital 
officials abruptly dropped their request to allow hinckley to visit 
his family over the easter holiday last year after the bundy 
correspondence was disclosed 
parker who presided at hinckleys trial for the attempted 
assassination of reagan ordered st elizabeths to let prosecutors 
examine the treatment records that figured in its decision to 
propose the field trip 
but parker has yet to rule on the governments request to see 
those writings which he placed under court seal last summer 
in a pleading filed earlier this week hinckleys lawyers 
opposed allowing the government to see the sealed material 
as an insanity acquittee mr hinckley is receiving treatment 
from the hospital with the ultimate goal of being rehabilitated 
the lawyers said 
for this treatment to succeed mr hinckley needs to have some 
sense of privacy the government wishes to invade that privacy 
without any legitimate need to do so

sein lwin resigned today as president 
of burma and from all his other major posts stateowned radio 
rangoon said after thousands of people protested his 17day rule 
with violent demonstrations nationwide 
troops have killed at least 95 people in massive antigovernment 
protests since sein lwin became president on july 27 the radio 
said the peoples assembly elected him to replace ne win who 
resigned after 26 years in power 
however western diplomats said the death toll may be in the 
hundreds and unconfirmed reports reaching bangkok put the figure 
as high as 1000 
the broadcast gave no reason for the resignation and no 
successor was immediately named the radio said a special meeting 
of both the central committee of the burma socialist program party 
and the peoples assembly would meet next friday 
earlier today a burmese guerrilla leader called on rebel groups 
to launch a nationwide offensive against sein lwins government 
soldiers in one town reportedly turned against the government 
and allowed thousands of protesters to march through the streets 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said 
burmese security forces were trying to get rid of evidence of 
civilian deaths by burning bodies 
radio rangoon said the 92nd meeting of the partys central 
committee today accepted sein lwins resignation as the party 
chairman by far the most powerful political position in the 
country 
the report also said the council of state accepted his 
resignation as president of the republic and from membership of the 
peoples assembly 
students initially led the antigovernment demonstrations which 
also demand a return to democracy and economic reforms but wide 
sectors of the population later joined in the bloody street battles 
sein lwin 64 a former military officer was held responsible 
by demonstrators for brutal suppression of student demonstrations 
in march and june as well as his predecessors earlier crackdown on 
dissidents 
demonstrators chanted slogans and carried placards through the 
streets of rangoon calling sein lwin a dog a butcher and 
a nazi 
but the radio said there were virtually no demonstrations in 
rangoon today it said protesters also dispersed in the north 
okkalapa suburbs where workers and others have battled troops in 
recent days 
but a thai official speaking on condition of anonymity said 200 
soldiers and 100 policemen stayed inside while thousands of 
demonstrators marched freely through victoria point in burmas 
southernmost province of megui for a third straight day today 
radio rangoon denied that victoria point a market town of about 
5000 people had been taken over by protesters 
brang seng leader of a coalition of burmese guerrilla groups 
called for an offensive from north to south to push the army 
from dozens of towns and cities in burma 
a spokesman quoted the guerrilla leader as saying rebels would 
attack government troops and calling on them to join in battling 
the government rebels fighting for autonomy control vast areas of 
the country 
the spokesman who refused to give his name read the statement 
over the telephone from burma 
brang seng is leader of the kachin army one of the ethnicbased 
rebel groups in the national democratic front coalition the 
coalition claims to field about 35000 rebel fighters the nine 
other rebel groups in the coalition could not be immediately 
reached for comment 
a senior western diplomat in burma who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said thursday that the actual death toll from the 
rioting may be in the hundreds he said solid information was 
virtually impossible to get partly because soldiers and protesters 
were fighting a battle for the bodies 
when someone is killed the protesters try to get it so 
they can display the bodies and the government tries to get it to 
cremate it so there would be no evidence of deaths he said 
he said the leadership accustomed to undisputed rule simply 
does not know how to handle the disturbances and has assumed that 
if enough force is applied the demonstrators will simply go away 
protesters have turned more violent responding to unprovoked 
killings by security forces who shot into crowds to disperse them 
the protesters mostly students buddhist monks and young people 
are getting 100 percent support from the public the diplomat 
said 
prime minister tun tin went on the radio thursday to say that as 
promised the government will urgently carry out economic reforms 
to boost living conditions reforms cant be implemented in the 
current violence he said 
it was the governments first hint of concessions since sein 
lwin assumed power in the impoverished nation of 38 million people 
diplomats say economic problems caused by ne wins isolationist 
policies are among the reasons for the uprising 
with a per capita income of less than 200 burma is one of the 
worlds poorest nations inflation is soaring and the country has a 
foreign debt of 4 billion

the central intelligence agency 
apparently weary of the controversy and protests surrounding its 
recruiting at the university of colorado has decided to move off 
campus this year 
in 1986 and earlier cia recruiting on the boulder campus 
resulted in demonstrations and arrests 
some students uninterested in cia work waded through the pickets 
anyway to talk to recruiters as a sort of counterprotest 
university placement director gordon gray said thursday many with 
sincere interest stayed away for recruitment purposes the entire 
process was inefficient he said 
this year the agency will accept individual applications and 
interview potential employees elsewhere gray said 
the process avoids big onetime oneplace confrontations

police hoping to hear a murder 
confession put a tape recorder near a womans body as she lay in 
her casket at a funeral home according to a lawsuit filed by the 
former suspect in the case 
michael odom contends it was improper for police to put the 
device in the casket of his girlfriend tracy lynn green in march 
1986 
odom had every right to expect complete privacy and did 
not expect or even envision such an act by a public servant says 
the suit filed thursday 
police hoped odom would confess to killing ms green 24 when 
he paid his last respects the suit says instead the tape 
captured comments that would have shown odoms innocence and 
police then erased the recording the suit contends 
police spokesman chuck johnson said the department would not 
comment on pending litigation 
ms green died 11 days after she suffered severe head injuries 
odom 32 told police she had jumped from his moving van during an 
argument but police said she had been beaten to death 
odom was charged with firstdegree murder in may 1986 he was 
held without bond until february 1987 when the state attorneys 
office dropped the charge 
a medical examiner said ms green could have fallen from the 
van and prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to 
bring odom to trial 
the lawsuit also says the investigation into ms greens death 
was tainted because a police detective made false statements in the 
arrest affidavit and withheld evidence favorable to odom

an outlawed tribal group today agreed to 
end its 10yearold campaign for an independent homeland in the 
northeastern state of tripura a government official announced 
the tribal national volunteers signed a memorandum of 
understanding with federal and state governments indias interior 
minister buta singh said in parliament 
under the agreement worked out in three months of negotiations 
the insurgents agreed to surrender their weapons within a month and 
abide by the constitution in return the tribal group will be 
given 20 seats in the new state legislature 
the chief minister of tripura s r majumder said the accord 
would bring peace and stability to the state bordering bangladesh 
authorities estimate nearly 600 died during the insurgency 
the problem started in 1951 with a steady influx of settlers 
from bangladesh and parts of india the economic and social 
patterns in the state shifted when the tribe members who originally 
settled the area were outnumbered 
in the 1970s tribal unrest gave rise to the tribal national 
volunteers which declared independent tripura as its objective 
and took up arms 
the violence escalated and in june 1980 nearly 400 people 
mostly nontribals were massacred 
the group set up its underground headquarters in the chittagong 
hill tracts in southern bangladesh and started training volunteers 
in april 1983 the leader of the underground movement bijay 
hrangkhawl rejected suggestions by thenprime minister indira 
gandhi for a negotiated settlement between the organization and the 
state government 
in 1984 the organization was outlawed but the violence 
continued 
in january 97 people were killed nontribals threatened 
retaliation and the tribal national volunteers vowed to disrupt 
scheduled state elections prompting the federal government to 
deploy the army 
the elections were held a month later despite the threats and 
prime minister rajiv gandhis congress party wrested control of the 
state from the marxist communist party 
in may the tribal national volunteers said they were willing to 
negotiate a settlement

president reagans spokesman today denounced 
housepassed legislation to withdraw all us investment from 
racially segregated south africa while supporter announced a 
campaign to ensure its passage in the senate 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the bill would 
destroy americas flexibility to seek change through diplomatic 
pressure such moves are more likely to stymie progress toward 
ending apartheid rather than to accelerate its end fitzwater 
said 
the house on thursday adopted on a 244132 vote the south 
africa sanctions bill which also would impose a neartotal trade 
embargo the bill faces threats of a republican filibuster and a 
reagan veto 
supporters hailed the dramatic measure as a lastchance 
opportunity to bring strong economic pressure to bear to help end 
south africas apartheid system of racial separation by expanding 
the less sweeping sanctions adopted in 1986 
but republicans said the bill represents a scorched earth 
policy that amounts to declaring economic war against south africa 
a war they said would hurt the blacks it is designed to help by 
causing millions to lose their jobs 
apartheid is a morally wrong and politically unacceptable 
system which is the root cause of south africas disorder 
fitzwater said 
however the imposition of sanctions is not the solution he 
said sanctions would hurt the very people that we seek to help 
they would destroy americas flexibility discard our diplomatic 
leverage and deepen the crisis 
groups supporting the bill told a news conference they still 
lack the twothirds majority needed to override a veto but believe 
they could get it signed by democrat michael dukakis if he is 
elected 
robert brauer legal counsel to rep ron dellums dcalif said 
proponents were meeting with key senate aides today to discuss 
strategy for the sept 8 debate of the sanctions bill in the senate 
foreign relations committee 
damu smith executive director of the washington office on 
africa which has lobbied for an end to apartheid said his 
organization will intensify a grassroots campaign against a 
threatened senate filibuster 
gop members called on the house to reverse course and adopt a 
policy of black empowerment to increase the economic and 
political power of blacks and weaken the foundations of the 
apartheid system 
but rep howard wolpe dmich and other sanctions supporters 
said that course simply will not work 
black economic empowerment in the face of apartheid is an 
impossibility wolpe said as the house voted down a trio of 
republicansponsored amendments designed to dilute or change the 
legislation 
with the house and senate eager to adjourn for the fall 
elections little time remains to push the bill through congress 
especially since both houses likely would be faced with votes to 
override a presidential veto 
in a policy statement the administration said reagans senior 
advisers will recommend that he veto the sanctions bill if it 
emerges from congress in its present form because it undermines 
the presidents ability to conduct foreign policy 
it was likely that senate opponents of the measure would launch 
a filibuster since there is no limit on discourse in that chamber 
opponents have refused in the past to agree voluntarily to limit 
discussion on such issues forcing the chamber to a cloture vote to 
shut off debate a vote that requires the support of a twothirds 
majority 
many republican opponents accused the house democratic 
leadership of staging a political vote to score points among black 
voters for democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis and 
for political activist jesse jackson on the eve of the republican 
national convention 
some of us wonder if the real purpose of this bill is to be 
responsive to the jacksondukakis foreign policy said rep 
william broomfield rmich 
we are not bringing this bill to embarrass republicans said 
rep ronald dellums dcalif principal sponsor of the measure 
we are here to free black south africa this has nothing to do 
with presidential politics 
dellums said white house officials citing ongoing peace 
negotiations in southern africa had asked him repeatedly over the 
last several days not to bring up the bill until after congress 
returns from its labor day recess 
he said he agreed to do so but only if reagan promised in 
writing not to veto the bill if it reached his desk 
dellums said that in the end the white house declined to make 
such a promise and he decided to go ahead 
in an emotional summary that drew a standing ovation from his 
colleagues dellums told the house 
i listened to those who said this is going to hurt blacks 
its going to hurt corporations but human beings will struggle for 
their freedom in peace if they can in violence if they must 
that pales every single argument you have made we must end the 
madness of apartheid 
the disinvestment legislation has its roots in the economic 
sanctions voted by congress in 1986 and still in effect they 
banned all new public and private loans and investments in south 
africa and barred certain imports and exports 
the bill contains these major provisions 
all us investment in south africa would be banned and us

militants he added 
chandigarh is the joint capital of punjab and haryana states a 
separatist campaign by sikh insurgents in punjab has killed 1680 
people this year 
it was an encounter with death said yash bir a passenger 
on the bus who suffered burn injuries in the explosion i was

the 120member crew of an 
offshore vessel surrendered command of the ship after taking it 
over early today in a labor dispute a spokesman for the dutch 
seamens union said 
jg harmsen said the incident in which the spanish crew of the 
dutchowned hermod seized command from dutch officers for three 
hours ended peacefully after a misunderstanding about the weeklong 
dispute was cleared up 
earlier today the captain of the hermod which hauls heavy rig 
equipment for the north sea offshore oil industry issued a 
distress call requesting navy assistance because of the mutiny 
according to a dutch navy spokesman 
apparently there were some violent threats towards the 
commanding officers the spokesman lt cmdr willem van geneste 
said it was unclear whether the dutch officers had been locked up 
during the incident 
harmsen said the crew was on strike for a week when it seized 
power today he said that early in the day the captain asked the 
crew to suspend its strike and weigh anchor in light of worsening 
weather conditions in the area where the vessel was operating 100 
miles northwest of this dutch navy port 
the crew failed to understand that the captain asked this 
because of safety reasons harmsen told the ap they thought it 
was another company ploy harmsen said the leaders of the mutiny 
abandoned their action after he explained the purpose of the 
captains request by shiptoshore radio 
the whole incident was based on a misunderstanding harmsen 
said adding that the strike had not been called off 
the hermod is owned by the dutch offshore construction company 
heerema engineering company spokeswoman ria de kok refused to 
comment on the incident but said the request for navy assistance 
had been withdrawn 
the labor dispute on board the hermod and several other vessels 
involves heeremas layoff procedures the majority of the 
companys 950 spanish sailors have shortterm labor contracts and 
are not protected by dutch labor law 
the sailors are demanding better conditions in dismissal cases 
according to harmsen

richard l thornburgh took the oath of office 
today as the nations 76th attorney general declaring the united 
states must consider drugs and drugtrafficking public enemy no 
1 
with president reagan standing at his side in the roosevelt room 
of the white house thornburgh said he would use every resource 
of the department of justice consistent with strict observance of 
the civil rights and civil liberties of all our citizens to fight 
other unique threats to our traditional values 
but he said i believe that unless we sustain a vigorous 
effort to make drug trafficking and drug abuse public enemy no 1 
we could well stunt significantly the capacity of todays young 
people to contribute to a better quality of life for tomorrows 
america 
shortly after his confirmation by the senate thursday 
thornburgh said he was not counting on keeping the job if george 
bush becomes president 
i look on this as a sixmonth assignment thornburgh said 
after an 850 vote confirmed him as successor to the controversial 
edwin meese iii 
the oath of office was administered to thornburgh by supreme 
court justice antonin scalia bush attended the swearingin 
ceremony thornburghs wife virginia held the bible while he said 
the oath 
the former gop pennsylvania governor said in a television 
interview aired in philadelphia that hell let the future take 
care of itself even if vice president bush is elected 
thornburgh 56 already has told senators that hes a loyalist 
to president reagan declaring last week his agenda is my 
agenda 
last week thornburgh said that fighting the scourge of 
narcotics would be his top priority but he also promised a 
vigorous battle against organized crime public corruption and 
whitecollar crime 
thursday he said every day of his potentially short tenure 
will be important because the process of law enforcement is a 
24houraday sevenday a week yearround proposition and im 
anxious and enthusiastic about getting on the job 
thornburgh likely will be able to concentrate solely on 
department programs unlike meese who spent considerable time 
defending his personal conduct 
meeses ethical behavior was investigated by independent counsel 
james mckay who concluded that the attorney general probably 
broke the law meese consistently denied that and maintained that 
the department was running normally despite defections by top aides 
during his final months as attorney general 
three other nominees for top justice department positions were 
less fortunate thursday than thornburgh as the senate quit for the 
summer without acting on them several senators used parliamentary 
maneuvering to block action unless the senate first took up 
legislation to enforce a treaty against genocide the genocide 
legislation was not considered 
the lack of action however is not likely to have a major 
effect on department operations since all three already are serving 
in acting capacities harold christensen as deputy attorney 
general francis a keating ii as associate attorney general and 
edward sg dennis jr as chief of the criminal division 
we almost worked out something but at the last moment we were 
unsuccessful said senate republican leader bob dole rkan the 
senate likely will vote on the three in september 
thornburgh was supported enthusiastically by meeses sharpest 
critics sen edward m kennedy dmass attempted to paint a 
contrast between the two men 
he said meese attempted to roll back decades of progress in 
civil rights gave favored treatment to friends and 
tarnished his high office 
thornburgh he said will be an attorney general of a 
different and better mold he will do as much as he can to 
repair the damage and injustices of the meese regime 
kennedy said he admired thornburghs work as director of the 
institute of politics at the john f kennedy school of government 
at harvard university the institute is named after the senators 
brother 
clearly we have a superior nominee here sen paul simon 
dill said of thornburgh 
the attacks on meese were lacking when republicans spoke but 
the praise for thornburgh was bipartisan 
sen strom thurmond rsc said thornburgh has demonstrated the 
characteristics needed for the job character integrity good 
judgment competence and independence 
thornburgh ran the justice departments criminal division during 
the ford administration and established the public integrity 
section that prosecutes corrupt public officials

wholesale price inflation increased to an 
annual rate of 57 percent in july spurred by big boosts over a 
wide variety of products including clothing automobiles 
furniture and poultry the government said today 
the increase came despite lower prices for beef as the drought 
prompted farmers to slaughter more animals because of burnedout 
pastures and higher feed prices 
just three days after the federal reserve board initiated an 
increase in interest rates to fight inflation the labor department 
said wholesale prices rose 05 percent in july the same monthly 
increases as in may and march 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we would 
rather not see any increase in producer prices but we still 
believe inflation remains low and under control 
in june the departments producer price index for finished 
goods rose 04 percent or at an annual rate of 46 percent more 
than double the 22 percent rate of wholesale price inflation for 
all of 1987 
wholesale prices for consumer foods increased at a slower pace 
in july 04 percent than for goods overall indicating to some 
analysts that the worst immediate effects of the drought plaguing 
the farm belt were over food prices had been rising faster than 
prices for other products on the wholesale level since april 
overall energy prices meanwhile remained unchanged after a 16 
percent drop in june with a 3 percent seasonally adjusted increase 
in gasoline prices offsetting a 61 percent decline in what 
distributors pay for home heating oil 
excluding food and energy wholesale prices rose at 06 percent 
in july because food and energy prices are highly volatile from 
month to month most analysts look to price changes for other 
products as a better indication of underlying inflation 
analysts said the softer food prices partly offset what they 
called an overreaction in june to the drought 
as expected higher feed prices and burnedout pastures have 
sharply increased market slaughters and begun to influence meat 
prices said donald ratajczak director of economic forecasting 
at georgia state university in addition ratajczak said fruit 
trees under stress from the unusually hot weather are throwing off 
their fruit early resulting in a temporary early supply of 
fruit 
wholesale prices in july fell 25 percent for beef 105 percent 
for pork and 02 percent for soft drinks they rose 23 percent for 
fruit compared with a 67 percent increase in june 75 percent 
for vegetables 133 percent for bakery products 2 percent for 
chickens and 203 percent for processed turkeys 
rataczak predicted that meat prices will rise sharply in 1989 as 
a result of the early slaughters and fruit prices will spiral 
upwards this fall because of less than the usual supply then 
price increases were widespread across a wide variety of 
nonfood items mens clothing rose 09 percent drugs were up 11 
percent cosmetics increased 17 percent and auto prices edged up 
05 percent after a 1 percent decrease in june 
the only nonfood nonenergy consumer items for which wholesale 
prices fell last month were glassware down 23 percent and 
household flatware down 04 percent 
the july increase in finished goods overall put the labor 
departments index at 1085 that means a variety of goods costing 
100 at the wholesale level in 1982 cost 10850 last month 
compared with 10790 in june and 10600 a year ago 
wholesale prices for intermediate goods used in production rose 
07 percent in july indicating more inflation lies ahead despite 
the federal reserve boards decision tuesday to boost the rate it 
charges banks for credit from 6 percent to 65 percent 
prices for intermediate goods or those used in processing had 
risen 09 percent in june analysts said the smaller july increase 
was due almost entirely to a decline in oil prices before before 
opec members iran and iraq agreed late in the monthy to a 
ceasefire 
excluding food and energy prices for intermediate goods such as 
industrial chemicals finished steel products paper and synthetic 
fibers rose 07 percent overall 
however raw material prices fell 11 percent with crude oil 
prices plummeting 93 percent corn prices soared 20 percent on the 
drought but the increase was smaller than in june raw iron and 
steel prices jumpted 12 percent after holding fairly steady for 
three months 
price changes on the retail level usually lag one to three 
months behind those at wholesale consumer price inflation has been 
averaging 44 percent for the past 18 months july figures on 
consumer prices are to be published aug 23

five vietnamese who fled to hong kong by boat 
left the british colony voluntarily for home friday the government 
reported 
about 23000 boat people remain in hong kong camps including 
about 90 others who have asked to be sent back to the communist 
nation about 500 miles to the south 
the vietnamese who arrived before june 16 are viewed as 
political refugees eligible for resettlement in third countries 
but under a new policy to curb the surging number of arrivals 
the about 7000 boat people who arrived since midjune are 
classified as illegal immigrants subject to repatriation unless 
they can prove political persecution 
vietnam said it will accept people who volunteer to return 
the five repatriated vietnamese men arrived in the same boat in 
december no reason was given for their decision to return

attorney general edwin meese iii ended his 
controversial tenure at the justice department today by signing an 
order that provides for independent counsels to investigate members 
of congress 
meese who has been investigated by two separate independent 
counsels since he came to washington in 1981 said his final act as 
attorney general will ensure that members of the legislative branch 
and top executive branch officials are treated in the same manner 
during federal criminal investigations however meeses order 
established some differences 
as many of you know many people have long felt that there was 
an undesirable disparity between the way that members of the 
executive branch and members of the legislative branch were treated 
when it comes to allegations of criminal wrongdoing meese said 
at his final press conference 
under the order if the attorney general receives specific and 
credible mation indicating that a senator or congressman has 
violated criminal law he must launch a preliminary investigation 
of up to 90 days to see whether a special counsel should be named 
to conduct a full probe 
based on the results of the preliminary probe the attorney 
general can either close the case or appoint a special independent 
counsel to investigate 
meese said members of congress will be treated similarly to top 
executive branch officials under the provisions of the ethics in 
government act passed in 1978 
in fact the procedures will differ for instance meeses order 
retained for future attorneys general the power to select any 
independent counsel to investigate members of congress but the 
ethics act invests that appointment power in a special threejudge 
panel in cases involving top executive officials 
earlier in the administration meese sought to have the act 
declared unconstitutional but the supreme court upheld it on june 
29 meese argued that the law infringed on the presidents power 
and resulted in unequal administration of justice because normal 
criminal cases were handled by the justice department 
even before the act was passed in 1978 the justice department 
had authority to hire special counsels to replace government 
attorneys in any case where the attorney general perceived a 
conflict for the government lawyers this was done in the watergate 
scandal 
but as a result of meeses order the attorney general is 
required under this code of federal regulations to follow these 
procedures with respect to members of congress according to a 
justice department official who did not want his name used 
meese said he had discussed the order with his successor former 
pennsylvania gov richard l thornburgh though not with anyone on 
capitol hill thornburgh could rescind the order if he chose to 
lawmakers who have dealt with the independent counsel law have 
said they believe the act already applied to members of congress 
among those with this view are reps peter w rodino jr dnj 
chairman of the house judiciary committee and barney frank 
dmass chairman of the judiciary subcommittee that reviews the 
law 
they quote the act as saying the attorney general may trigger an 
inquiry to determine whether an independent counsel should be 
appointed if he determines that an investigation or prosecution 
of the personby the attorney general or other officer of the 
department of justice may result in a personal financial or 
political conflict of interest 
meese said the ethics in government law permitted him to sign 
the rule applying coverage to congress but he waited until 
thornburgh had been confirmed to shield him from any problems 
meese said he had no idea why congress did not spell out that 
the law should cover its own members but meese said his order will 
not apply to investigations that are currently under way 
meese is leaving the justice department to serve as a fellow at 
the conservative heritage foundation a think tank and the hoover 
institute at stanford university he also intends to hit the 
lecture circuit 
while at the white house meese was investigated by independent 
counsel jacob stein on allegations that he may have used his office 
for personal gain stein brought no charges against meese 
more recently independent counsel james mckay investigated 
meese on allegations of conflict of interest and looked into his 
relationship with e robert wallach a lawyer who has been indicted 
in the wedtech case wedtech is a defense contractor in the bronx 
new york 
mckay said last month that prosecution of meese was unwarranted 
although the attorney general probably violated tax and 
conflictofinterest laws 
meese harshly criticized mckays comments and said the special 
counsels report vindicated him 
at his news conference meese said neither he nor anyone at the 
white house would have helped wedtech secure government contracts 
if they had known wedtech was a nest of criminals 
i would not have had anything to do with it he said

the us postal service has done what 
revolutionary warera carpenters could not rebuild trinity church 
by july 26 1788 
the historic church on wall street in lower manhattan burned 
down in 1776 construction on the second trinity began in august 
1788 but on stamps issued july 27 in new york city the churchs 
spire stands tall above the date july 26 1788 when the building 
remained in ruins 
the postal service has an obligation to posterity to depict 
the facts as they are complained historian john tauranac in a 
letter to postmaster general anthony m frank 
as the stamp now exists it will go far in miseducating the 
public which is a grave disservice one might even say an 
engraved disservice tauranac wrote 
his letter failed to move postal officials who issued the stamp 
to mark the anniversary of new yorks ratification of the us 
constitution an event which actually took place in poughkeepsie 
anyway 
jack williams of the post offices stamp division said the 
25cent stamp is supposed to be reminiscent of an era rather 
than representative of the city on a specific date

jesse jackson won an extension today of a 
temporary court order barring a businessman from selling or 
distributing videotapes of jacksons speech to the democratic 
national convention 
us district judge james b zagel extended the temporary order 
until tuesday when he said he planned to issue a written opinion on 
jacksons lawsuit seeking to permanently bar mpi home video from 
selling or distributing the videotape 
im pleased with the result said henry mason one of 
jacksons attorneys but mason said he expected the lawsuit would 
be heard in a trial unless the two sides reach some type of 
settlement 
waleed b ali the suburban businessman who sold the videotapes 
of the former presidential contenders convention speech testified 
thursday that he was motivated by money and the events historic 
importance 
i thought we had a hotseller ali said 
ali president of mpi home video in suburban oak forest 
acknowledged during the hearing that he had never obtained 
permission to sell the tapes from the former presidential candidate 
but attorneys for mpi contend the company didnt need jacksons 
authorization because his hourlong speech july 19 in atlanta was a 
news event unprotected by federal copyright law 
alis attorneys have argued that mpi legitimately purchased 
abctvs coverage of the speech from the network for 6500 
ali said that while viewing the speech live on abctv he knew 
it was newsworthy and worth preserving for historic reasons 
our position is that it is news ali testified 
you admit that reverend jackson never authorized you to make 
this tape asked jacksons attorney william conlon 
absolutely ali testified i dont have any arrangement 
with the rev jackson 
the 60minute tape jesse jackson we can dream again is 
comprised of uncut abc coverage including commercials and camera 
shots of the convention floor ali said 
ali said that until a july 29 temporary restraining order barred 
the sale and distribution of the tape until today his firm had 
shipped about 7100 cassettes at a list price of 1495 each 
jackson who did not appear in court thursday testified last 
week that mpis tape has hurt our ability to make a living off my 
work 
he said he reaped 100000 four years ago from marketing a 
videotape of his speech to the 1984 democratic national convention 
and that mpis distribution of this years speech has cut into its 
market potential

republican platform writers wrangled over 
us policy in southern africa today as they strived to wrap up 
their preconvention work on a document that highlights george 
bushs experience 
the 106member platform committee looked for ways to avoid a 
divisive fight over deployment of the star wars antimissile system 
after finishing with the domestic portion of the 30000word 
document thursday 
but it was southern africa that sparked an early fight between 
more militant committee members and those pushing the views of the 
bush campaign 
first the committee agreed to denounce south africa 
republicans deplore the apartheid system of south africa and 
consider it morally repugnant 
but then the committee turned back a series of amendments 
designed to blame communists for many of the problems in that 
troubled region 
for example jim summers of washington wanted to specify that 
all communist troops should leave angola rather than all foreign 
troops the phrase pushed by the bush forces 
if it looks like a red and talks like a red lets call it 
a communist he said 
but rep tom loeffler of texas head of the foreign policy 
subcommittee argued against any changes words are delicate 
written comments cannot be retracted 
summers proposal was rejected as was language offered to 
condemn the african national congress a key group fighting the 
south african government 
its a communist group said angela bay buchanan of 
california the amendments sponsor 
loeffler said he agreed with the sentiments but said any change 
can cause problem with respect to the situation in south africa 
the bush forces did accept an amendment opposing the 
maintenance of communist forces in mozambique 
todays session focused on the 60 pages of defense and foreign 
policy language began with praise for republican nomineetobe 
bush and criticism of democratic nominee michael dukakis 
there is one person who can fill the full measure of the 
awesome charge of being president george bush said rep tom 
loeffler of texas the grim truth is mr dukakis that the oval 
office is no place for onthejob training 
the oval office phrase is in the platform itself 
foreign policy is an area that bush views as a strength in his 
battle against dukakis the governor of massachusetts 
rep bill mccollum of florida denounced as pure political 
hogwash rhetoric from dukakis and running mate lloyd bentsen that 
bush has not been deeply involved in foreign policy 
we have a candidate who has been more involved in foreign 
policy than anyone who has ever run for president of the united 
states mccollum said 
there was a bitter tangle on aids on thursday but the committee 
members while dissenting on a variety of issues chose not to 
disturb bushs hopes for a peaceful convention with floor fights on 
the platform 
i doubt very much that there will be any floor fights said 
sen robert kasten of wisconsin cochairman of committee the 
moderates in our party have had a significant impact on the newer 
issues in the platform 
earlier today gop chairman frank fahrenkopf interviewed on 
cbs this morning said were a conservative political party 
were proud of that were not afraid of the c word 
fahrenkopf said however the document will reflect bushs plans 
for a new direction in education in environment in child care 
the vice president came here in an unprecedented event and 
spoke to this platform committee and tried to give them that 
direction so that this really will truly be a bush platform he 
said 
the gop platform committee will meet again monday afternoon 
after the opening session of the convention to take a final vote 
before the convention faces the issues on tuesday 
one possible fight today looms over when to deploy president 
reagans star wars plan formally called the strategic defense 
initiative 
strong star wars backers led by angela buchanan of california 
pushed through a change earlier this week to make the platform call 
for rapid and certain deployment of sdi 
but former sen john tower of texas a bush spokesman on 
defense told reporters that the platform would reflect the 
original draft language calling for deployment as soon as feasible 
i dont think we should begin the program by acting too 
precipitously he said 
ms buchanan vowed a fight at the committee against any changes 
my understanding is that the vice president is comfortable 
with the language she said 
most of thursdays session was peaceful in sharp contrast to 
the heated debates earlier in the week on such topics as abortion 
sen lowell p weicker jr of connecticut dropped his plans to 
press an amendment calling upon the gop to back tough economic 
sanctions against south africa and a possibe floor fight was 
averted over abortion when moderates dropped plans to challenge a 
plank that says we believe the unborn child has a fundamental 
individual right to life which cannot be infringed

israels preelection debate on the future of 
the occupied territories is turning into a battle of the generals 
the liberal labor party of foreign minister shimon peres is 
reassessing policy based on the recommendations of retired military 
chiefs who believe giving back land may not jeopardize the nations 
security 
but their positions are disputed by exgenerals aligned with the 
rightwing likud bloc of prime minister yitzhak shamir they argue 
that a smaller israel is a more vulnerable israel 
could we leave judea and samaria the west bank and be safe 
the answer is no said retired maj gen yehoshua saguy a likud 
candidate for parliament 
the nov 1 elections may turn on whether israeli voters are 
willing to risk giving up all or part of the 2266 square miles of 
west bank and gaza strip captured in the 1967 middle east war 
much of the new thinking about the territories is coming from 
the liberal labororiented council for peace and security which 
includes among its members 30 major generals 80 brigadier generals 
and 100 colonels 
spokesman moshe amirav says after four months of internal 
debates the private think tank is getting ready to publish a 
series of papers on the military implications of giving up 
territory 
amirav said participants reached a consensus on four major 
points 
evacuated areas would become demilitarized except possibly 
for some troops along the jordan river 
the jordan river would be the military frontier 
israels air force would control of the skies over any 
territory yielded to the arabs 
israel would maintain early warning stations in the west bank 
perhaps existing bases on 50year leases 
retired maj gen menachem meron of the peace council said it 
could take years to establish adequate security safeguards 
our group believes territorial compromise can be achieved and 
defense arrangements can be made even if they cover a long period 
of time he said in an interview 
the daily yediot ahronot newspaper said a withdrawal plan was 
being drafted for the labor party by a group of senior reserve 
officers headed by avigdor bengal a retired major general and 
leading figure in the peace council 
it would replace a labor party policy paper that envisioned 
israel holding onto the jordan valley and other strategic areas of 
the west bank for security reasons 
under the previous plan israel would keep 50 to 60 percent of 
the territory but in terms of security we say it can give up to 
100 percent if these conditions are met amirav said 
he said the council has reached a consensus that a palestinian 
state is not by itself a mortal threat to israel although this 
has become a slogan of the right 
saguy who has emerged as a leading likud spokesman on defense 
policy said israels defense strategy is built on its ability to 
mobilize reserve troops and the ooccupied land is needed to buy 
time for troops to get into position 
he said maintaining the jordan river as a defensive line allows 
israel to send troops to the frontier without being subject to 
attack in hostile areas of the west bank in between 
some prowithdrawal generals said accurate longrange missiles 
make it unnecessary to hold onto the territory as a buffer but 
saguy said the extra time provided by territorial depth is more 
critical than ever 
alouph hareven a former intelligence colonel and leading figure 
in the peace council said former generals will play a key role in 
selling the public on the need to get rid of the occupied lands 
the israeli public is not sentimentally attached to nablus 
hebron or other areas of the west bank what matters to them is the 
security dimension he said 
saguy a former head of military intelligence agreed voters 
would decide on the basis of security issues but he said nobody 
sees an alternative to holding the territory right now 
raphael raful eitan a former chief of staff and now a 
leading figure in the nationalist tehiya party said israel should 
annex all occupied land 
we must annex all of the territory and massively settle 
every spare corner of the land of israel eitan a legislator 
said on israel radio 
saguy was forced to resign and eitan retired after a judicial 
commission criticized them for failing to prevent the massacre of 
palestinians by christian militiamen in the beirut camps of sabra 
and chatilla in 1982

the leaders are harvard law graduates who could be 
earning more than 100000 a year the participants are high school 
and college students who could be at the beach instead theyre 
working as a sort of urban peace corps that organizers hope will 
set a national example 
the program called city year is a privately funded community 
service project fifty students ages 18 to 21 from high school 
dropouts to brown university students were culled from 150 
applicants 
they begin their days at 8 am sharp on boston common with 20 
minutes of calisthenics if theyre late they do extra exercises 
they spend the rest of the day on various projects battling the 
summers searing heat and humidity as well as urban blight 
one day they sort surplus food in a warehouse other days they 
help paint and renovate shelters for the homeless clear brush from 
vacant lots or work with disabled children 
we call it city year because we thought of it as being like 
junior year senior year then city year said michael brown 27 
a recent harvard law school graduate who is one of the groups 
directors we say why not spend a city year helping your city 
before going on to college 
city year ends this summer but organizers hope to get enough 
funding to make the program yearround they plan to start it up 
again next year 
raquel mello 17 said shes learned a lot about other 
people she said she enjoyed working on a project with disabled 
children so much that she found it painful to leave 
though youth corps exist in other cities city year president 
alan khazei said most of them are governmentfunded khazei began 
working on the program during his last year at harvard law with two 
other students and a fourth person from another college they took 
their idea around to bostons business community in the hope of 
receiving funding and were rewarded 
bain amp company bank of boston equitable financial services and 
general cinema each donated 25000 to fund four of the five 
10person city year teams citizen contributions funded the fifth 
team 
one of the big issues with national service is how do you fund 
it said khazei well weve reached out to the private sector 
to show it can be done 
khazei said he and his colleagues prefer working to promote 
the idea of national service rather than taking highpaying 
corporate jobs 
this is a lot more fun he said we love what were doing 
i cant think of anything more rewarding than working with 
wonderful young people 
kristen hollister 27 a brown graduate is one of the 
individual team leaders because she knows sign language the two 
hearingimpaired participants were assigned to her team 
when i read the program proposal i said this is it this 
is what i have to do to make a difference she said 
hollister said the highlight of her teams work came on a recent 
sweltering day at a shelter for the homeless the students spent 
the day on the third floor of the shelter reupholstering chairs for 
the women in the shelter 
each of them got to carry a chair down to the women at the end 
of the day said hollister when the women saw the chairs they 
all cheered it was such a high 
a stint spent working at the massachusetts hospital school for 
disabled children was the high point for many of the students 
winda maldonado 17 who is deaf said it was a revelation to 
her to care for children with greater disabilities than herself 
it was my favorite place she said i loved it i dint 
want to leave i made so many friends 
caleb jacobsonsive 17 a prep school student said that prior 
to city year he might have avoided people like the ones there 
but i look at handicapped people totally differently now this 
city year has changed my outlook on a lot of things

communist east germany on friday hailed the 
positive effects of the berlin wall where 77 people have been 
killed in attempted escapes to the west since it was erected in 
1961 
on the eve of the walls 27th anniversary the official 
communist party newspaper published a lengthy article repeating 
longstanding allegations that the 13foot barrier had blocked a 
planned attack from the west 
under a headline reading for peace for socialism the neues 
deutschland newspaper recalled the start of the walls construction 
on aug 13 1961 from then on positive effects have continued 
up until today and will continue in the future it said 
the summer sunday 27 years ago stands in close relation to the 
struggle for the maintentance and strengthening of peace security 
and cooperation on our continent the newspaper added 
east german border guards hastily began erecting the wall 
through downtown berlin dividing the city east and west when the 
flow of refugees to west germany became so great it threatened to 
cripple the communist nations economy 
today armed east german guards with shoottokill orders patrol 
the wall around the clock floodlights illuminate it at night 
neues deutschland said that in 1961 the western powers used 
hysteria and an open threat of military force as the answer to the 
proposals of the soviet union and other socialist countries for the 
assurance of peace and the resolution of the anomalous situation in 
berlinwest 
the paper said there were plans at the time for a forcible 
change of the status quo 
the attack was tried out in a series of nato maneuevers and 
troop readiness areas were drawn up the paper said 
the august 13th working group a west berlin organization that 
monitors human rights in east germany says the number of people 
who have been killed in escape attempts is 77 
the last reported death came on may 23 1987 when a lifeless 
body was carried away from the wall on the east berlin side 
rainer hildebrandt the head of the august 13th group told a 
news conference on friday the shoottokill orders are still in 
effect at the berlin wall and on the boundary between the two 
german states 
the orders reportedly have been temporarily suspended at times 
for example during president reagans visit to west berlin last 
year 
maik sohr a former east german soldier who fled to the west in 
may said he estimated that 90 percent of those who want to flee to 
west germany are apprehended before they can make an attempt 
he said special security units track potential escapees by 
watching for unusually large bank withdrawals or sales of personal 
possessions

president roh taewoo threatened 
friday to crack down on student demonstrations to safeguard the 
olympics radicals on six campuses hurled firebombs and rocks at 
police who fired tear gas 
an eruption of demonstrations involving firebombs stones and 
tear gas during the olympics would disrupt the olympics and our 
nation would become an object of worldwide scorn roh told a 
meeting reviewing preparations for the games scheduled to begin 
sept 17 
also friday south korea asked north korea to meet at the truce 
village of panmunjom in one week to discuss the possibility of full 
parliamentary talks on easing tension on the korean peninsula 
about 6000 radical students from 22 universities held rallies 
or staged violent street demonstrations in seoul and six provincial 
cities protesting a police blockade of a march to north korea for 
unification talks the march is planned for monday 
riot police fired tear gas to drive students back at six 
campuses witnesses reported some arrests and injuries but police 
declined to give any figures 
national police headquarters in seoul said 2099 radicals were 
detained wednesday and thursday for taking part in demonstrations 
to support the march it said all but 243 were released 
riot police continued to ring college campuses and stand guard 
at government buildings to try to foil preparations for the march 
to the panmunjom border truce site the government banned the march 
and police have mounted a major security effort to block it 
police officials said students have attacked 13 police stations 
around the country this week and several dozen officers were 
injured 
roh accused radical students of trying to overthrow the 
government and siding with north koreas demand to be a cohost of 
the olympics 
roh appealed to opposition leaders kim daejung and kim 
youngsam who attended the olympic briefing to dissuade radical 
students from the march and violent protests the opposition 
promised support for the olympics but stressed the need for 
dialogue between the government and student leaders 
it is deplorable that a small number of dissidents and radical 
students are huring a successful olympic mood with demonstrations 
and calls for joint olympics roh said 
north korea sought the meeting on tensioneasing measures for 
wednesday but south korea counterproposed friday the twoday 
delay apparently is aimed at protecting celebrations of the 
olympic mood on wednesday 30 days before the start of the 
olympics 
north korea has called for a meeting of the two countries 
legislatures to discuss its bid to become a cohost of the olympics 
and draft a nonaggression pact 
the peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of world 
war ii north korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the korean 
war

president kenan evren approved a 
constitutional amendment friday to allow earlier municipal 
elections opening the way for a national referendum on the issue 
the amendment backed only by the governing motherland party 
passed 28495 in the 450seat legislature a week ago 
turkeys 1982 constitution written under military rule 
requires at least five years between local elections that meant 
local elections could not be held in turkey before march 1989 
the amendment calls for local elections nationwide on nov 13 
but the nation must vote on any constitutional amendment adopted 
by fewer than 300 votes in parliament 
the referendum is expected to take place sept 25 
political analysts say the governing party wants early polls 
partly because they do not want to give the main opposition social 
democrats time to organize under new leadership

the light sheen of oil left by a ruptured 
barge in the gulf of mexico was drifting away from barrier islands 
on the mississippi gulf coast and should eventually evaporate the 
coast guard said today 
the situation is definitely improving said coast guard 
petty officer bob morehead at one point thursday the oil slick 
had threatened to wash onto the beaches of ship and cat islands 
about 10 miles off the mississippi mainland 
an estimated 5000 gallons of oil leaked from the barge after it 
struck a submerged barge early thursday a few miles off the 
mississippi coast the submerged barge which was loaded with scrap 
iron had sunk monday during the rough seas of tropical storm beryl 
morehead said 10000 barrels of oil was pumped from damaged 
areas of the oil barge onto another vessel thursday night allowing 
the barge to float free it was moved away from the site of the 
accident and was no longer leaking oil he said 
the patches of oil remaining from the leak were too light to be 
skimmed from the water but the sun and wind should evaporate most 
of the crude as it drifts out to sea morehead said 
we talked with the mississippi bureau of marine resources and 
they said there was very little potential for major environmental 
damage due to the oil morehead said

checked maloney told the associated press he noted however 
that there had been no official announcement of the soviets 
destinations

president reagan has selected army lt gen h 
norman schwarzkopf to become the next head of the us central 
command the military arm responsible for all american forces in 
the middle east the pentagon said friday 
assuming senate confirmation schwarzkopf would replace marine 
gen george crist whose tenure has included more than a year of 
tanker escorts by american warships in the persian gulf as well as 
combat clashes between us and iranian forces crist is to step 
down from his command on nov 23 and retire 
schwarzkopfs selection had been widely rumored for several 
weeks ever since pentagon sources disclosed defense secretary 
frank c carlucci had rebuffed pleas by the navy to install an 
admiral as crists successor 
vice adm henry c mustin the deputy chief of naval operations 
plans policy and operations was the navys candidate instead 
the pentagon announced friday that he will retire on sept 1 after 
more than 33 years of active service 
when the central command was originally created as the followon 
to the rapid deployment force of the carter administration 
pentagon officials decided the commanding general should rotate 
between the marine corps and army in case troops had to be sent in 
at the time the biggest threat to peace in the region was 
considered the soviet union which was viewed as having designs on 
the oil supplies that are crucial to the west 
but then the iraniraq war erupted and expanded to the waters of 
the persian gulf and president reagan decided last year to escort 
reflagged kuwaiti tankers through the waterway that prompted the 
navy to begin arguing for a naval expert in the top job 
carlucci finally intervened in the matter deciding even before 
the recent ceasefire agreement between iran and iraq to stick with 
the original rotation plan 
schwarzkopf 53 now is the armys deputy chief of staff for 
operations and plans and the senior army member of the military 
staff committee to the united nations he would receive his fourth 
star and the rank of general in assuming the new job 
the pentagon said reagan has nominated lt gen john w foss to 
assume schwarzkopfs old post foss 55 now is the commanding 
general of the xviii airborne corps and of fort bragg nc maj 
gen carl w stiner 51 would replace foss and be promoted to

bourbon street has always appealed to the 
prurient but french quarter merchants have draped new orleans 
famous party street with red white and blue to attract the 
patriotic as well during the republican national convention 
american flags hang next to drawings of bare breasted women 
beckoning to passersby while multicolored bunting competes for 
attention with a fake pair of womens legs that swing forward and 
back from two stories above 
on this naughty street of takeout drinks and knockout strip 
shows merchants are hoping to lure republicans with traditional 
tawdriness and newfound politics 
hes tan rested and ready nixon in 1988 adorns one 
tshirt bearing a black and white likeness of the former president 
other shirts found in various souvenir shops carry the standard 
logo of the official 1988 gop convention 
bourbon street is ready for the republicans the question 
however is are the republicans ready for bourbon street 
everybody should see this city said jeff levy a delegate 
from los angeles there are lots of weirdos here but everyone 
should see them its hot but excellent 
wroughtiron balconies bars named for pirates provocative 
dancers of both sexes and 24hour liquor attract an eclectic group 
michael montolbano the doorman at pat obriens where tourists 
slurp rosycolored hurricanes in a glass they can take home said 
some republicans have already experienced the street 
you can spot em by the way they dress in those 800 suits and 
the way they carry themselves power tie power look the whole 
bit he said 
dancer bonnie holloway said she expects the republicans to party 
just like everyone else 
if they get drunk they should spend money theres going to 
be a lot of men at this convention they said so itll be good for 
us she said 
the doorman at papa joes which bills itself as having the only 
female impersonators on bourbon street said republicans seem to 
enjoy looking at men dressed up like women 
they seem to be having fun at least they get a couple of 
laughs out of here said manny moreland 
but a hostess at the coffee pot around the corner from bourbon 
street and a bartender at court liquors to go said theyve noticed 
little change yet 
the french quarter of course is not the only place new orleans 
likes to party 
a grand party for the grand old party started the convention 
festivities on friday with a picnic in city park probably the only 
family event scheduled for the week the grand party featured 
bands choirs fireworks and free rides on the parks narrowgauge

sein lwin rose to prominence by 
personally killing a burmese rebel leader in 1950 and commanding an 
army company that shot down rioting rangoon university students in 
1962 
when thousands of students went on a rampage last march in some 
of the worst riots burma has experienced sein lwin led the forces 
that stopped them 
analysts had suggested the 64yearold former general would be a 
logical scapegoat as the government of ne win his close ally 
sought to appease critics and stabilize the country 
instead sein lwin emerged last month as burmas most powerful 
leader to succeed ne win who resigned after wielding near absolute 
power since a coup 26 years ago 
protests of authoritarian rule intensified this week and 
soldiers killed at least 95 demonstrators protesters carried 
placards calling sein lwin a dog nazi and butcher of students 
and many burmese said he was the most hated man in the country 
on friday sein lwin resigned as president of burma and chairman 
of the ruling burma socialist program party 
little has been published about sein lwin and others in burmas 
senior hierarchy most of whom live in seclusion 
according to john badgley a burma expert at cornell university 
in the united states sein lwin is a mon tribesman born in mattama 
village the mons are one of several ethnic minorities in the 
southwest asian country 
he completed the fourth grade at most in a buddhist monastery 
school many burmese still look down on him for his low level of 
education and relative lack of manners 
sein lwin joined the army in 1942 when burmese officers 
including ne win were siding with japan against the allies 
specifically britain colonial master of the former kingdom 
as the war progressed the officers switched allegiance 
realizing japan was as much a threat to burmas independence as 
britain independence in 1948 was followed by a chaotic 14year 
experiment with democracy 
maj sein lwin became known during that period as the man who 
cornered and killed sabaw u gyi leader of the ethnic karen 
rebellion he developed a reputation as a man with courage and 
decisiveness but limited vision and a strain of brutality 
among the troops his nickname was chinthe for the mythical 
lion that guards the entrances of buddhist temples in burma 
he once was ne wins personal aide and was at the leaders side 
when ne win seized power in 1962 and began enforcing his brand of 
economic socialism militarybacked authoritarian rule and 
isolation from much of the world 
soon after the coup sein lwin led his army unit in quelling the 
riots at rangoon university firmly establishing his reputation as 
an unbending leader prepared to wield an iron fist to root out 
opposition 
most burmese are interested in the supernatural but sein lwin 
has a preoccupation with astrology magic and black arts and for 
three years was the secret publisher of a magazine called veda 
dealing with such matters badgley said in an interview 
sein lwin retired from the army and in 1977 joined the partys 
central executive committee he won the no 4 party post of joint 
general secretary in 1985 and also became secretary of the council 
of state the no 3 position in the government after president and 
vice president 
he has held ministerial portfolios for cooperatives transport 
communications and home affairs 
on march 18 a day later dubbed bloody friday thousands of 
students swept through downtown rangoon burning cars and shouting 
antigovernment slogans it was the second student outburst in 
three months 
the lon htein or riot police were called out reinforced 
by regular army units and armored vehicles western diplomats and 
burmese sources said sein lwin commanded the police from a tactical 
headquarters at the government broadcast station 
they said he overruled some leaders who wanted to be more 
lenient the government has acknowledged 43 deaths but more than 
100 people are believed to have been killed

three members of a us government team taking 
part in a nuclear testing experiment in the soviet union engaged in 
some unauthorized souvenir collection there the white house 
said today 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater however said that 
based on information available so far to us officials we dont 
believe it was intelligence activity of any kind 
the individuals picked up and attempted to ship on for their 
personal use some rock samples a piece of barbed wire an allen 
wrench and a hammer fitzwater told reporters at the white house 
the individuals involved have been removed from the list of 
those who might return for the experiment he said 
fitzwater noted that the team was in the soviet union under the 
auspices of an agreement announced by president reagan and soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev for a joint verification experiment in 
the field of nuclear testing 
we dont believe it was intelligence activity of any kind but 
it was a personal mistake on their part fitzwater said adding 
that we have informed the soviet union of this yes 
fitzwater declined to divulge the names of the three people 
involved 
the team apparently was under the auspices of the energy 
department fitzwater said only that it included geologists who 
were there to work with rocks and minerals related to the 
experiment 
the materials were discovered by soviets inspecting equipment 
crates being prepared for shipment back to the united states said 
deputy press secretary roman popadiuk 
the washington post reported in todays editions that moscow had 
issued a formal diplomatic protest over the july 17 incident 
but fitzwater said there had been no formal exchanges 
a us official told the newspaper that both the soviet union 
and the united states were trying to resolve the problem in a 
lowkey manner 
the team was in the soviet union under an agreement by which the 
superpowers are allowing each other to observe and monitor each 
others nuclear blasts the agreement is not connected to the 
monitoring of weapons under the intermediaterange nuclear forces 
treaty a defense department spokesman said 
theres no question but that we stepped over the bounds of the 
agreement the newspaper quoted an unidentified senior 
administration official as saying thursday the official said the 
incident presumably stemmed from an innocent mistake 
the attempted shipment by the americans who were not 
identified involved materials such as tools and wire associated 
with soviet nuclear test preparations at the test site near 
semipalatinsk in southcentral russia as well as soil and rock 
samples of potential use in assessing yields of soviet nuclear 
blasts the newspaper quoted officials as saying 
the items were found by soviet authorities during a search of a 
crate of personal belongings of a us official and two employees 
of private firms under contract to the federal government the post 
said 
spokesmen for the departments of energy and state as well as the 
soviet embassy declined to comment the energy department 
according to the post has conducted a secret investigation of the 
incident 
robert barker assistant secretary of defense for atomic energy 
and chairman of the military liaison to the energy department told 
the post the americans were absolutely not deliberately trying 
to collect prohibited materials 
when contacted late thursday by the associated press barker 
denied making the comment to the post and refused to speak about 
the issue 
the soviet ministry of foreign affairs issued a private protest 
july 25 to us diplomats that demanded permanent expulsion of the 
three and a detailed explanation the newspaper reported 
the us official and one of the contractor employees had left 
the country before the protest was issued and the other contractor 
employee was allowed to remain in the soviet union after the united 
states denied he was responsible the post said 
a us official not identified by the newspaper said we are 
trying to resolve it in a lowkey way and the soviets are 
too 
the special nuclear experiment for which the team was in the 
soviet union is scheduled for next month at the test site near 
semipalatinsk 
the post quoted unidentified senior us officials as saying the 
incident was not expected to halt the progress of the agreement 
which also calls for observation of tests at the us site in 
nevada 
the project in question was part of the joint verification 
experiment concerning nuclear testing and has nothing to do with 
onsite inspection or the inf treaty navy cmdr ken pease told 
the associated press on thursday night

faithful geyser in yellowstone national park and firefighters 
today faced dozens of lightningstarted fires in idaho 
fire burning underground in a peat bog in washington state 
bedeviled firefighters and choked a seattle suburb with smoke 
youre walking along and it looks like solid ground and then 
you fall three feet into hot coals said lynda coombs a 
volunteer at redmond wash its like standing in a barbecue 
pit 
forest and brush fires also burned in california montana and 
nevada a grass fire in utah was contained and firefighters 
controlled a lightningsparked grass fire that burned up to 15000 
acres in the nebraska panhandle 
in yellowstone the 40000acre north fork fire jumped across 
the road north of old faithful and authorities said the road 
probably would open and close periodically with increased fire 
activity the geyser was still accessible from the south extra 
crews of firefighters were assigned to the blaze as it moved 
eastward bringing the force up to 700 people 
the fire has been moving very fast is burning very hot and 
putting up a large column of smoke said park spokeswoman joan 
anzelmo the column of smoke was between 35000 and 40000 feet 
high thursday afternoon 
about 2000 firefighters were working on fires that had burned 
about 196000 acres of yellowstone as of thursday 
flames quieted down enough on the 34000acre shoshone and red 
fires in the park to allow officials to reopen the majority of the 
approximately 400 spaces at the grant village campground today 
anzelmo said 
a thunderstorm that swept through idaho thursday dotted the 
states forests and rangelands with flame estimates of the number 
of fires jumped from 50 to 75 thursday night as dispatchers 
received more reports 
the walker creek fire on the caribou national forest forced the 
evacuation of about 16 families from their homes on indian creek 
south of inkom in southeastern idaho the 3000acre blaze was 
believed contained thursday but wind gusting to 25 mph pushed the 
flames over lines and toward the homes 
crews in the challis national forest in central idaho worked to 
create a buffer between the 13500acre battleaxe wilderness fire 
and a guard station and a private airstrip about a mile to the 
south 
smoke from the peat bog fire at redmond wash combined with 
patchy fog has caused morning commuter traffic problems and road 
closures and the stench has choked residents and dairy cows 
an irrigation sprinkler was used to apply 35000 gallons of 
water an hour cooling the ground so firefighters could walk on it 
and use hoses to spray the smoldering peat as it was exposed by 
bulldozers and backhoes 
its so hot out there youre pants will catch on fire it will 
get in your boots said bill james a volunteer firefighter from 
carnation 
police sgt george potts said visibility was so low in the smoke 
thursday morning that he couldnt see a patrol car with flashers 
working more than six feet away its like driving into a brick 
wall potts said 
firefighters in nevada controlled a lightningcaused blaze after 
it charred 1800 acres of brush with 50foothigh flames in the 
outskirts of carson city that forced about 200 people to briefly 
evacuate their homes

steep elkhorn mountains to battle the warm springs creek fire the 
fire has burned some 2500 acres in the helena national forest

a mental hospital friday abandoned plans to 
take john w hinckley jr on a field trip after the secret service 
turned up a new cache of writings by the man who shot president 
reagan seven years ago 
the decision by st elizabeths hospital was announced at a 
hearing originally convened by us district judge barrington d 
parker to consider the plan to allow hinckley to join other 
patients on a supervised outing 
but letters by hinckley found this week during an investigation 
by the secret service prompted hospital officials to drop their 
request 
based on recent materials received thursday night the 
hospital determined that further clinical assessment by mr 
hinckleys treatment staff is necessary before it would permit him 
to participate in such an offgrounds activity said dr raymond 
f patterson reading from a letter sent to the judge 
the hospital no longer plans to include mr hinckley in the 
upcoming recreational activity in the community patterson 
director of st elizabeths hospitals forensic services unit added 
comments during the hearing by us attorney jay b stephens and 
defense lawyer vincent fuller indicated that the writings were 
letters hinckley had sent to an unidentified third party 
parker said he would not grant stephens request to release the 
writings which prosecutors had placed under court seal thursday 
night until fuller had a chance to file an objection 
fuller said hinckley may have some proprietary interest in 
the writings that would prevent them from being released 
hinckley who wore a sport jacket and tie sat impassively 
throughout the brief hearing 
the white house declined comment we have never taken a 
position on hinckley matters and we wot now spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said 
outside the us courthouse stephens said he would continue his 
efforts to make the writings public because they relate to a 
matter of great national importance they relate to an individual 
who shot the president of the united states 
the public should be aware of what these materials are 
stephens said indicating that the writings figured directly in the 
hospitals decision the request to take hinckley on a field trip 
we provided materials to st elizabeths last night they 
withdrew their request for an offsite visit this morning 
stephens said 
the decision also came after federal prosecutors cited 
disturbing entries made this week in hinckleys treatment 
record at the hospital 
hinckley 33 has been confined to st elizabeths since he was 
acquitted by reason of insanity of shooting reagan presidential 
press secretary james s brady and two other men on march 30 1981 
brady who was shot in the head remains confined to a 
wheelchair and has difficulty speaking as a result of the injuries 
he suffered 
hospital officials had not formally outlined its specific plan 
for the outing but court records indicate the field trip may be a 
picnic or a party at a bowling alley 
the hospital dropped a request in april 1987 to allow hinckley 
to visit his parents during the easter weekend after investigators 
turned up evidence he had traded letters with multiple murderer 
theodore bundy who is held on floridas death row 
a psychiatrist testified last year that hinckley also had once 
received a letter from lynette squeaky fromme who is 
imprisoned for trying to kill president ford in 1975 
hinckleys correspondence with bundy and other writings seized 
from his room last year remain under court seal

programmers hope a new software program that can 
print out music as its played will score a hit with composers 
you play it prints its a speeding up of the whole 
process said john borowicz a cocreator of the program it 
understands everything about standard music notation and it can 
accurately transcribe what you play 
the program called finale by coda music software of 
bloomington minn was unveiled thursday at the macworld expo 
boston 88 the program can translate information from a keyboard 
guitar or wind instrument 
borowicz a composer and computer scientist said he and his 
partner phil farrand worked on musical transcription software for 
about five years before producing the program 
the software he said costs 1000 and is aimed at the 
professional level or the intense amateurs 
although he said the new program will allow composers to produce 
more music in less time some musicians were hesitant to applaud 
the new development 
ran blake the director of the new england conservatory of 
musics department of third stream studies said he was personally 
interested but questioned whether it was an appropriate tool for 
students 
i wonder if they shouldnt have a mentor to teach them such 
intricacies as harmony he said 
although word processing has advanced rapidly music notation 
has benefited little from technology some software programs allow 
composers to print music by punching in notes on a computer staff 
but the new program frees musicians from working separately on 
composing performing and editing 
the new program borowicz said is works the way the musician 
works the musician does not have to work the way the software 
works 
finale allows the musician to edit a piece at any point 
you can play it back you can stop it at any point you can 
manipulate down to the micro level borowicz said you can also 
point to the note drag it to where you want it or change it

about 25000 demonstrators some 
lugging crosses urged mass boycotts of the last temptation of 
christ upon its release today and at least one major theater 
chain has decided against showing the film 
the movie opens in nine major cities at the height of a 
nationwide fundamentalist furor sparked by christians who say it is 
blasphemous in its portrayal of a jesus christ tempted to abandon 
his divinity 
in new york city today about two dozen demonstrators picketed 
in front of the ziegfeld theater some shouting at the hundreds of 
filmgoers who formed a line that wrapped around the block for a 
matinee showing 
we see it as an attack on morality and traditional family 
values said rabbi yosef friedman who carried a sign reading 
rabbis protest mockery of any religion we feel these people 
who are mocking christianity today would also be willing to mock 
judaism 
wargames director john badham joined warren beatty and 
michael mann at the directors guild of america today in support of 
the film 
we owe a debt of gratitude to this group of somewhat misguided 
zealots the film now will be seen by a lot of curiosity seekers 
badham said what is not terrific is their effort to rewrite the 
bill of rights 
an estimated 25000 protesters jammed the streets around 
universal studios thursday adding their voices to a chorus of 
protest that has stretched from the studio lot to the halls of 
congress 
a lot of impressionable people who would see this will 
receive a totally skewed biased and blatantly false portrayal of 
the person who is nearest and dearest to our hearts our savior 
jesus christ said the rev paul crouch president of trinity 
broadcasting 
newton massbased general cinema theaters decided against 
showing the movie after company executives screened it this week 
the company the nations fourthlargest movie chain with 1338 
screens in 318 locations offered no explanation for its decision 
in maryland delaware and north carolina newsletters and 
petitions are being circulated in churches urging their members to 
persuade theaters not to book the movie the owners of oregons two 
largest theater chains have said they will not show the film as 
did the 44screen douglas theater co chain in nebraska 
and in boston cardinal bernard law urged his archdioceses 
roman catholics to boycott the film because it is morally 
offensive and repugnant to christian belief 
one way to be heard is by not going another way is to write 
the producers law wrote in the archdiocesan weekly paper 
the movie directed by martin scorsese and distributed by 
universal opens to the public today in los angeles chicago 
washington san francisco seattle minneapolis new york montreal 
and toronto an invitationonly screening thursday in montreal drew 
about 30 peaceful protesters outside the theater 
last week the studio suddenly advanced the release of the film 
by six weeks giving its opponents less time to organize threatened 
boycotts and perhaps taking advantage of the current publicity 
in thursdays protest buses carrying thousands of christians 
rolled into the universal parking lot backing up traffic for a 
mile on the nearby hollywood freeway and on roads around the 
headquarters of mca inc universals parent company 
many demonstrators lugged wooden crosses others with children 
in tow carried handprinted signs reading boycott blasphemy 
and the greatest story ever distorted 
opponents of the film are enraged by scorseses portrayal of 
jesus as an ambivalent savior in a hallucination while dying on 
the cross christ imagines abandoning his divinity to live as an 
ordinary man and fantasizes about sex with mary magdalene 
most of the films antagonists have not seen last temptation 
and base their enmity on reports from the small number of clergy 
who have viewed it 
scorsese has defended his film saying he wished to create a 
story that would provoke people to think about jesus as a man 
confronting temptation he said the film should be considered art 
translated from a novel not an interpretation of the gospels the 
film is based on the 1955 novel by greek author nikos kazantzakis 
willem dafoe the actor who portrays jesus christ in the film 
said today that he is baffled by protesters complaints 
no i dont understand i dont understand i just think this 
is a beautiful powerful positive film some people that for the 
most part havent seen it are coming out against it that i dont 
understand he said in an interview on nbctvs today program 
while reactions from clergy across the nation have been largely 
negative some have been more tolerant 
beth cox summer minister for the fairfax unitarian church in 
virginia said christ could have been tempted by the sensual 
jesus was man and divine ms cox said i would think that 
the human side of him would have those thoughts 
yet other members of the clergy suggested that the best thing to 
do was not to make much ado about the motion picture 
we find the film offensive but were not going to turn out 
the troops to march on theaters monsignor william reinecke 
chancellor for the catholic diocese of arlington va we dont 
want to play it up 
among the participants in thursdays demonstration were the rev 
donald wildmon executive director of the american family 
association of tupelo miss and bill bright president of the san 
bernardinobased campus crusade for christ 
bright has offered to raise 10 million to buy and burn the 
film and wildmon has urged a nationwide boycott of mca 
conservative reps william e dannemeyer rcalif robert k

a letter from president reagan to mikhail s 
gorbachev was delivered to a top soviet official friday by the us 
ambassador and a western official hinted the message concerned 
talks on the ballistic missile treaty 
the western official speaking on the condition he not be 
identified by name or country said that after handing over the 
letter us ambassador jack matlock and soviet first deputy 
foreign minister yuli m vorontsov discussed the talks on the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
the official who was familiar with the meeting and the letter 
hinted that the message from reagan also concerned the talks 
scheduled to start aug 24 in geneva 
the official news agency tass reported that matlock had 
delivered a letter to vorontsov from reagan and said they discussed 
limiting nuclear and space arms building on the talks held 
during the moscow summit meeting 
the aug 24 meeting is required under the abm treaty which 
calls on the two superpowers to hold a conference every five years 
to review its implementation 
disputes over the abm treaty are among the stumbling blocks 
toward reaching agreement on an accord that would halve the 
superpowers arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons the kremlin 
contends reagans antimissile program popularly called star 
wars violates the abm treaty but washington says it is allowed 
at their summit in moscow reagan and gorbachev failed to 
resolve the dispute

president reagan noting the approaching 27th 
anniversary of the construction of the berlin wall said friday the 
barrier is dramatic proof of communisms failed dream 
noting a speech he gave last year challenging soviet general 
secretary mikhail s gorbachev to tear down the wall reagan said 
the united states is honored to stand firmly with the british and 
french to defend the freedom and promote the wellbeing of berlin

said in a statement that wall is a both a scar across the city 
of berlin and a symbol of the division of the german nation and of 
europe 
as tentative breezes of openness begin to stir the societies 
in the east the wall now stands in stark contrast to the human 
struggle for freedom taking place in its shadow reagan said 
there is no more dramatic proof of communisms failed dream than 
the wall 
he said that as we recall the construction of the wall on this 
day in 1961 the people the united states reaffirm their commitment 
to berlin and salute the brave people who live there

much of the south could suffer economically if 
the depletion of softwood timber continues at the current pace 
without being replaced a senior agriculture department official 
said friday 
forest service chief f dale robertson said a new study by the 
usda agency state forestry agencies and universities and the 
forest industry found that the annual removal of timber is greater 
than growth in many areas of the south 
timber is the regions leading agricultural crop and the 
processing of timber and timber products is the primary source of 
employment he said 
although the results of this study are of concern we have 
also found numerous opportunities for ensuring that timber 
production can continue to prosper and grow in the south 
robertson said 
since the 1880s when the souths first forest was devastated 
by fire and poor management two new forests have been regenerated 
and harvested he said the souths fourth forest the forest 
of the future can be even more productive 
according to the report 22 million acres of cropland and 
pasture in the south would be of more value if the lands were 
planted in pine trees 
conversion to timber production could increase annual softwood 
growth by 21 billion cubic feet the report said and the 
replanting of cutover and nonproductive trees on cutover lands 
could increase net annual growth by an additional 32 billion cubic 
feet 
in other words the study showed that conversion of cropland and 
replanting could nearly double the souths current annual softwood 
growth of 57 billion cubic feet 
robertson said the report presents a challenge and an 
opportunity for southern farmers and landowners 
already the owners of 15 million acres of highly erodible 
cropland in the south have decided to plant trees on that acreage 
under usdas conservation reserve program he said more 
opportunities exist to increase timber growth profitably 
copies of a summary of the report the souths fourth forest 
opportunities to increase the resource wealth of the south are

the state senate today reviewed a 
houseapproved bill that would require counties to adopt central 
purchasing systems a reform proposal prompted by a widespread fbi 
investigation into local corruption 
the legislature is meeting in a special session called by gov 
ray mabus in an attempt to change the prevailing county system 
under which each of five county supervisors directly oversees 
operations in his or her district 
as state auditor for the four years before he was elected 
governor mabus assisted the fbi in its operation pretense 
investigation into corrupt county purchasing it resulted in the 
arrests of 52 supervisors in 24 counties of which 43 were 
convicted or pleaded guilty and 23 received prison sentences 
the measure which passed the house thursday on a 11110 vote 
is similar to a bill approved by the house at the end of the 1988 
regular session 
under the housepassed bill a unit system for road construction 
and maintenance would have to be in place by oct 1 1989 
twentytwo counties already have a similar system the central 
purchasing system would remain in effect unless county voters 
rejected the plan 
the measure passed without debate and few amendments were 
approved 
one significant amendment adopted would prohibit a member of the 
board of supervisors from acting also as county administrator 
central purchasing clerk or road manager 
members of the senate county affairs committee met this morning 
to discuss the bill after a brief session thursday 
although the house and senate were stalemated at the end of the 
1988 session on the bill lt gov brad dye said he believed things 
would be different this time 
these senate members realize just like those house members 
that we cant leave here wihout passing that legislation he said 
under the new system one appointed administrator would oversee 
daytoday purchasing for the county a job currently shared by 
supervisors

three us technical experts involved in 
monitoring soviet nuclear blasts have been relieved of their duties 
after the soviets found them trying to make off with souvenirs 
from an atomic test site administration spokesmen said friday 
the spokesmen dismissing the episode as a misunderstanding 
said the items found by soviet authorities in creates being 
prepared for shipment back home included a small hammer a piece of 
barbed wire and several rock and core samples from a hole being 
drilled at the site 
the july 17 incident occurred near semipalatinsk in 
southcentral russia a ussoviet agreement allows each country 
to observe and monitor each others nuclear blasts the us 
experts were at the site in advance of a planned explosion in 
september 
state department spokesman charles redman said that after 
consultations with soviet authorities it was decided that the 
three who were not identified will not be returning to the 
testing site next month 
one was said to be an energy department employee and the other 
two reportedly were working under energy department contracts 
the soviets expressed concern over the incident but no formal 
protest was lodged redman said 
redman said the hammer and the barbed wire were intended as 
personal souvenirs as for the geological samples the americans 
asked the soviets for permission to remove the items and had reason 
to believe the request would be approved he said 
these items were of a minor nature certainly not of any 
military or technical significance redman said describing the 
incident as a misunderstanding 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said we dont believe it was intelligence activity of any kind 
but it was a personal mistake on their part 
asked whether it wasnt strange for americans to try to make off 
with rocks and soil redman said if youre involved in this kind 
of work those might be considered souvenirs 
the washington post reported in fridays editions that the soil 
and rock samples are regarded by us officials as potentially 
useful in assessing yields of soviet nuclear blasts 
one official told the post that soil samples can be examined for 
radioactive contaminaton which might reveal the type and quantity 
of nuclear materials used in nuclear bombs 
but redman said the rock and core samples were of the same type 
as that already provided to us experts by the soviets 
according to redman the issue has been discussed at length 
between us and soviet authorities and is being resolved 
he added that the joint monitoring program will continue with a 
us test set for aug 17 in nevada and the soviet test scheduled 
for midseptember

a federal judge removed from a ku klux 
klan case by an appeals court said today he wants to hear from the 
justice department before deciding whether to bar himself from all 
federal government cases 
us district judge william m acker jr at the end of an 
hourlong hearing on his own motion to ban himself from justice 
department litigation withheld any immediate ruling 
he said he did not know how he would rule eventually but i 
have made my mind up that i am not going to rule on my motion to 
recuse until i hear from william bradford reynolds who is 
director of the civil rights division of the justice department 
acker said he wanted reynolds comments about his being assigned 
to hear alabamas college desegregation case which has been marred 
by judicial conflict including bitter language over the removal of 
a black federal judge during the past several years 
i will defer until i hear from him on that matter acker 
said 
attending todays hearing was us district judge uw clemon 
who in 1980 became the first black federal judge in alabama he was 
removed from the college desegregation case by the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals on grounds that clemons past role as a 
state senator and civil rights attorney presented a judicial 
conflict 
clemon in a 10page opinion this week fired back that he was 
the victim of a double standard demeaning to black federal jurists 
acker a 60yearold white judge who was appointed by president 
reagan in 1982 was not urged to disqualify himself from all 
federal government cases during todays hearing three attorneys 
leon ashford joe whatley and doug jones told the judge they had 
found him to be fair and impartial they are not involved in the 
litigation that led to ackers removal from the klan case

the navy has decided not to send another 
of its billiondollar aegis cruisers to the persian gulf to 
replace the uss vincennes which shot down an iranian airliner july 
3 officers said friday 
lt cmdr tim taylor a spokesman for mayport naval station in 
florida said the departure of the uss mobile bay has been 
temporarily postponed until further notice 
the mobile bay had been scheduled to leave the base friday to 
join the us navy joint task force middle east which includes 27 
warships in the gulf and arabian sea 
taylor said he could not discuss the reasons and maj shelley 
rogers a defense department spokeswoman in washington declined 
comment on whether the delay was related to iraniraq ceasefire 
scheduled for aug 20 
military sources in bahrain indicated privately the decision was 
related to an expected cutback in the size of the us force after 
a truce in the 8yearold war but would not be specific 
they said the vincennes was expected to remain in the region 
until early september and one said an end to the war would 
sharply reduce any need for the navy to send another of its 
most sophisticated warships to the region 
ships normally serve about three months with the middle east 
force and the vincennes which arrived may 22 had been expected to 
leave for its home port at san diego in the next two weeks 
the military sources described the practice as flexible but 
would not say why the vincennes was being kept on longer than 
usual us navy policy provides for ships to be away from home 
ports no longer than six months 
defense secretary frank c carlucci repeated this week that the 
force of 27 warships including 18 in the gulf would be reduced 
sharply if the ceasefire held for a prudent period 
all 290 people aboard the airbus a300 were killed when the 
vincennes mistook it for an iranian f14 fighter on an attack 
course and shot it down with missiles 
an official report is expected to be released later this month 
after study by carlucci and the joint chiefs of staff 
pentagon officials have said it will blame human error by 
radar operators in the stress of firsttime combat the ship had 
sunk two iranian gunboats in a skirmish less than an hour before 
the jet passed overhead on a flight to dubai from a 
militarycivilian airfield in bandar abbas

president pw botha on friday 
accused us congressmen of recklessness and said a tough 
sanctions bill passed by the house of representatives could 
jeopardize a regional peace plan 
botha said the legislation would not help south african blacks 
and might obstruct or make impossible an initiative to end 
south africas 73year rule over southwest africa also known as 
namibia 
the recklessness of members of congress who do not care in the 
least whether their actions adversely affect the search for a 
peaceful solution to the problems of southern africa as a whole is 
astounding botha said 
the sanctions bill would halt us investment in south africa 
and impose a neartotal trade embargo it was approved by the house 
on a 244132 vote thursday 
the bill faces a possible republican filibuster in the senate 
and a likely veto by president reagan earlier legislation which 
passed despite reagans veto bars imports of various south african 
commodities and forbids south african planes to land at us 
airports 
botha said the bill emerged for purely internal political 
aims 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater also 
denounced the bill saying it would destroy americas 
flexibility to seek change through diplomatic pressure 
republican members urged the house to adopt a policy of black 
empowerment to increase the economic and political power of 
blacks and weaken apartheids foundations 
but rep howard wolpe dmich a sanctions supporter said 
black economic empowerment in the face of apartheid is an 
impossibility 
leading black antiapartheid activists in south africa 
including anglican archbishop desmond tutu have urged the west to 
intensify sanctions as a means of pressuring the government to 
grant full political rights to the 26 million blacks who have no 
vote in national affairs under apartheid 
many black moderates and conservatives as well as several 
prominent white liberals support the governments contention that 
sanctions will have the harshest effect on blacks and will harden 
the white minoritys resistance to political change 
botha said he found it particularly remarkable that the 
house acted on the bill exactly at a time when positive progress 
was being made with the peace negotiations between south africa 
cuba and angola 
the three countries monday announced a ceasefire in the angolan 
civil war south africa said it was prepared to begin implementing 
a un plan for namibian independence nov 1 provided agreement 
could be reached on a timetable for withdrawing cubas troops from 
angola 
the estimated 50000 cuban soldiers have been supporting 
angolas marxist government in a 13year war against a south 
african and usbacked rebel movement the movement the national 
union for the total independence of angola is not a party to the 
ceasefire 
it would be ironical if resolution 435 the un independence 
plan for namibia should reach the point of implementation only to 
be obstructed or made impossible as a result of provisions in the 
american legislation botha said 
he said unspecified financial transactions necessary to 
implement the plan could be affected by the sanctions bill

business inventories climbed for the 18th 
consecutive month in june the government said friday prompting 
some economists to warn that companies may be stockpiling goods in 
anticipation of higher prices 
the commerce department said inventories jumped 07 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 7339 billion in june following an identical 
07 percent rise in may inventory levels have not fallen since 
december 1986 
my guess is that there is a little buying ahead on inventories 
in anticipation of higher inflation going on when it happens that 
just adds to inflationary pressures said allen sinai chief 
economist of the boston co 
in a separate report the labor department said wholesale prices 
rose 05 percent in july a 57 percent annual rate that was more 
than double the 22 percent rate for all of 1987 
however other economists noting that business sales have 
increased more strongly than inventories werent troubled by the 
gain in goods held on shelves and backlots 
business sales surged 15 percent in june to 4906 billion 
following a 08 percent gain in may it was the fifth month without 
a decline 
even though inventories were up sharply they were still in 
line with sales said kathleen cooper chief economist of 
security pacific national bank in los angeles 
its a reflection of the exportdriven turnaround in 
manufacturing if youre selling more domestically and overseas 
then you need more inventory she said 
theres been some hedge buying against price increases but we 
think its been fairly small said lawrence chimerine chairman 
of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa consulting firm 
inventories in june were 78 percent higher than a year ago 
while sales were 81 percent higher 
the june inventory accumulation was boosted by a 10 percent 
climb at the retail level where sales were weakest a 08 percent 
increase at the wholesale level and a 04 percent gain at factories 
the strength in business sales was paced by a 25 percent jump 
at wholesalers sales from manufacturing plants climbed 15 percent 
and retail sales were up only 04 percent 
an advance estimate of retail sales for july released thursday 
showed a 05 percent increase 
the combination of strongly rising sales and moderately rising 
inventories pushed the inventorytosales ratio down slightly from 
151 in may to 150 in june that means it would take 150 months 
to exhaust inventories at the june sales pace a ratio not 
considered abnormally high

president ali khamenei said friday that iran 
has emerged from eight years of war against iraq as a victorious 
regional power with new worldwide respect 
also on friday iran denied iraqi claims that it shelled iraqi 
military positions a un factfinding team arrived in the iranian 
capital to investigate allegations of iraqs use of chemical 
weapons 
today the system of the islamic republic of iran for all the 
ineffective efforts of the enemies has turned into an important 
power in the whole of the region khamenei said at a prayer 
sermon at the tehran university campus his remarks were broadcast 
on staterun tehran radio 
the nation of iran is counted as an armed and established 
military force in the region he said 
khamenei said iran gained worldwide respect because of the 
military prowess it displayed in the war which he said the country 
acquired without depending on outside powers 
these eight years of war and resistance taught other nations 
that it is possible to defend themselves without depending on big 
powers he said adding iraq had been defeated because it has 
not been able to achieve its despicable objectives 
iran and iraq agreed last week to an aug 20 ceasefire in their 
conflict which killed or wounded an estimated 1 million people 
iran had recently suffered a series of losses on the 
battlefield leading it to accept a un ceasefire resolution july 
18 
in another development british diplomat david reddaway arrived 
in tehran friday for talks about british and other foreign hostages 
held in lebanon by proiranian groups before leaving london 
reddaway said he would speak with officials about the 18 hostages 
who include anglican envoy terry waite and two other britons as 
well as nine americans 
the foreign hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
a spokesman for the war information headquarters in tehran 
dismissed iraqs claims of iranian shelling as false 
propaganda the official islamic republic news agency said 
baghdad accused iran thursday of shelling iraqi military 
positions near the shatt alarab waterway where the persian gulf 
war broke out in september 1980 
the accusation was made in a statement issued by the iraqi 
mission to the united nations in new york it was not carried on 
newscasts in iraq 
in his speech khamenei urged iranian volunteer and other forces 
to remain at the front to defend the country and to give more power 
to iran on the international political scene 
even after the war defense will continue and members of the 
armed forces and volunteers must be present to defend irans 
territorial integrity alongside the countrys reconstruction he 
told the throng of worshipers 
worshipers chanted down with the usa down with the 
soviet union and down with israel and pledged to obey 
revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the audience at khameneis sermon included about 100 iraqi 
prisoners of war with about 25 of them wearing red headbands 
indicating they want to fight iraqi president saddam hussein 
the crowd was smaller than that at a similar sermon attended by 
an associated press reporter four weeks ago 
an official at the prayer service said the crowd was small 
because so many people have followed the call to go to the battle 
front he spoke on condition of anonymity 
plastic collection boxes were on hand at the sermon for 
worshipers to contribute to the war effort 
since iran announced it was accepting the un ceasefire 
resolution the once allpervasive slogan war war until 
victory has been abandoned said a westerner based in tehran 
the islamic republic news agency said a fourmember team of 
chemical weapons experts would travel to the northwestern kurdish 
town of oshnaviyeh in the province of west azerbaijan 
iran alleges that a chemical attack on the town earlier this 
month injured more than 2000 civilians including many women and 
children 
un reports have confirmed iraqs use of chemical weapons in 
the past 
at the united nations a spokesman said friday that the 350 
unarmed un military observers monitoring the ceasefire between 
iran and iraq will have headquarters in both tehran and baghdad 
several members of the observer group are already in tehran and 
baghdad and the rest are to be in place wednesday in preparation 
for the aug 20 ceasefire

republican george bush with president reagan at his side told 
administration officials today they must persuade voters that in 
the election whats at stake is a way of life democrat michael 
dukakis blamed rising interest rates on eight years of borrowing 
and spending borrowing and spending 
in new orleans meanwhile the 30000word gop platform was 
taking shape combining statements of party positions on domestic 
and foreign policy issues with sweeping attacks on dukakis 
bush and reagan at the white house addressed about 200 
administration officials whom bush said must be messengers of 
hope in the campaign 
all the good things youve accomplished are not in focus in 
the minds of the electorate the vice president said the 
officials job he said would be to spread the word of 
administration successes and pave the way for extending the 
reagan revolution into the bush era 
reagan in a jovial mood welcomed the officials to the white 
house complex 
white house complex thats what the democrats have after 
eight years out of office the incredible thing is they still 
cant take the hint reagan said 
in springfield ill gov jim thompson one of the people on 
bushs list of potential running mates said he had called the vice 
president and asked that he be removed from consideration 
i talked to the family about it and i now believe that at this 
moment in the time of jim thompson and his family its not the 
right thing to do thompson told reporters 
as the 106member platform committee began its final session in 
the partys convention city rep tom loeffler of texas said 
there is one person who can fill the full measure of the awesome 
charge of being president george bush the grim truth is mr 
dukakis that the oval office is no place for onthejob training 
winding up a fivestate campaign swing dukakis said reagan 
administration budget deficits were to blame for rising interest 
rates 
as we all know sooner or later the bill collector comes to 
the door dukakis told a breakfast at the governors mansion in 
richmond va thats what happened yesterday in the united states 
of america 
he referred to the fact that major banks raised their prime 
lending rate half a percentage point thursday to 10 percent that 
is the rate charged their largest most creditworthy customers 
the dukakis campaign also announced it was going on the air in 
california and texas with its first television advertisement of the 
general election campaign 
the oneminute commercial will stress dukakis economic themes 
his accomplishments as governor of massachusetts and include 
excerpts from his democratic convention speech 
with less than a week to go before he will claim the gop 
presidential nomination in the mammoth superdome bush was joining 
president reagan for a precampaign pep talk to senior 
administration officials who are expected to fan out across the 
country this fall to boost bush 
interviewed on cbs gop chairman frank fahrenkopf said the heart 
of the platform will not change that much from its conservative 
stance of 1980 and 1984 
were a conservative political party he said were proud 
of that were not afraid of the c word 
fahrenkopf said the document will reflect bushs plans for a 
new direction in education in environment in child care 
the vice president came here in an unprecedented event and 
spoke to this platform committee and tried to give them that 
direction so that this really will truly be a bush platform he 
said 
before the gop platform committee adjourned thursday it 
finished its draft of domestic planks the major remaining fight 
was over a star wars plank that called for deployment of the 
spacebased missile defense system as soon as technically 
feasible language backed by bush conservatives sought a call 
for rapid and certain deployment 
bush in washington told cbs he jogs and plays horseshoes to 
help relieve the pressure of preparing for his acceptance speech at 
next thursday nights convention session im no william jennings 
bryan and i think itll go ok he said in a reference to the 
democratic politician and orator from the turn of the century 
the bush campaign leaked private polling data that said senate 
republican leder bob dole helped bush more than other potential 
running mates but by a margin not considered very significant 
a campaign source said the kansas senator and former rival for 
the nomination added a little bit but not enough to make much of 
a difference 
the data from bushs chief pollster robert teeter were described 
as all but complete 
three national polls released thursday showed dukakis 
postconvention surge had crested dukakis 18point lead the week 
after the democratic convention shrank to 14 points in an nbc 
newswall street journal survey conduced aug 58 a cnnusa today 
poll the same aug 58 period gave dukakis a 12point lead while a 
business week poll done aug 49 put the two candidates in a dead 
heat 
all three of the polls placed support for dukakis in the 50 
percent range while support for bush ranged from 36 percent to 45 
percent 
the margins of error were three percentage points either way in 
each poll

ahead of us were going to continue to advance our programs and 
policies until we cross the finish line next january 
george bushs policies work reagan said the other folks 
talk george bush will deliverwe are going to hold the white 
house with george bush 
most people will vote for george bush this year because after 
voting for him twice before they know hes their guarantee that 
peace and propsperity today will be followed by more peace and 
prosperity tomorrow 
and frankly reagan continued i dont think the american 
people want to gamble their future on a blind date 
reagan handed bush a gavel at the conclusion of his speech 
claiming i figure that with the convention coming up you can 
probably use that gavel if not there from experience there will 
be a lot of meetings with the congressional leadership when you can 
use that 
the meeting was attended by cabinet and subcabinet officials 
who are exempt from a federal prohibition on campaigning that 
applies to lowerlevel federal bureucrats 
bush called the officials the field commanders of the reagan 
revolution and said more than most americans you have an 
important understanding of the importance of the election that 
stands ahead 
bush and reagan are to meet again at an airport rally next 
tuesday in new orleans as reagan leaves the convention city and 
bush arrives the two also are expected to spend about four or five 
days after the convention campaigning together according to 
campaign sources 
meanwhile top bush campaign advisers were to hold a strategy 
session today to discuss convention logistics and the vice 
presidents closely guarded selection of a running mate 
bush said thursday he would not discuss whos off the list and 
whos on the list although campaign sources did say that private 
polls for the campaign show former rival sen bob dole rkan 
would give him a larger boost than others being considered 
however the sources also said that a bushdole ticket showed up 
as only marginally stronger than other potential combinations for 
which polling was done 
doles advantage is a little bit but not enough to make much 
of a difference said one source 
a ticket of bush and bob dole ran stronger than a hypothetical 
ticket of bush and doles wife former transportation secretary 
elizabeth dole the sources said 
on thursday bush met with a group of black republican 
supporters and vowed to make an aggressive effort to court black 
voters who have traditionally voted democratic 
bush said his campaign would demonstrate his commitment in the 
field of civil rights and in opening the arms of this party 
he declined to say whether he would name a black to his cabinet 
a promise he had made previously only to hispanics he also refused 
to be dawn into a discussion of whether he was considering lt gen 
colin l powell the first black ever to hold the post of national 
security adviser for the no 2 spot 
i have worked closely with colin powell and i have great 
respect for him bush said but he added dont put it into 
any vice presidential equation 
several newspaper columns have suggested powell as an ideal 
running mate an idea also backed by rep jack kemp rny who is 
believed to be on bushs short list 
sources close to bushs selection process said that powell is 
not being actively considered 
meanwhile bush said hes opposed to higher interest rates but 
wont criticize the federal reserves action this week raising the 
discount rate the rate it charges for shortterm loans to banks 
from 60 percent to 65 percent 
i cant assault them right now for this bush said in an 
interview with abc news business world scheduled to be aired 
sunday youve got to find the right mix to prevent inflation 
or high interest rates from gaining the upper hand he said 
in raising the rate that usually provides a bellwether for other 
rates throughout the economy the fed said it was acting to keep 
the lid on inflation 
a transcript of the taped interview was released thursday by the 
network 
on another subject bush broke with the reagan administration 
and voiced support for the recommendation of a commission headed by 
new york investment banker nicholas brady that a single agency 
preferably the fed be given authority over financial markets 
brady a close friend of bushs was selected by reagan last 
week to succeed james a baker iii as treasury secretary however 
the white house never has endorsed the findings of his report on 
the oct 19 stock market crash

air base as the protesters arrived from a churchrun school two 
miles away 
the demonstrators included delegations from manila 50 miles to 
the south the group was to hold a similar protest saturday outside 
subic bay naval base 30 miles southwest of angeles 
the us military tv station the far east networkphilippines

to use other routes to avoid the protest

department civilians and military dependents are stationed at 
clark subic and four smaller installations 
also on friday capt douglas j katz commander of the 
battleship uss new jersey told reporters at subic that the us 
navy could relocate its facilities but hoped such a time would not 
come 
he said subic was the finest base in the pacific and it would 
be a loss to the navy if the lease on us military facilities in 
the philippines is not renewed when it expires in 1991 
president corazon aquino is under pressure not to renew the 1947 
bases agreement she has agreed to honor the lease through 1991 but

year in military and economic aid for continued use of the bases

drastic increase in compensation without assurances that the bases 
will be allowed to remain beyond 1991 
speeches and slogans during fridays rally accused mrs aquino 
of subservience to the americans and said she already has secretly 
agreed to extend the agreement

with vice president george bush promising he 
wont name his running mate until next weeks republican 
convention the field of potential candidates shrunk today when 
illinois gov james r thompson said he had withdrawn from 
consideration 
thompson said he called bush this morning and said he didnt 
want to be considered further because of the potential impact the 
job would have on his family he had been one of more than a dozen 
people contacted as a possible running mate with bush 
earlier california gov george deukmejian also had taken 
himself out the running 
the vice presidents job requies a lot of national and 
international travel thompson said at a news conference in 
springfield ill my wife couldnt travel with me because ive 
got a 10yearold in school and thats not true of the other 
candidates 
meanwhile bushs staff debated the best way to orchestrate the 
announcement of bushs running mate 
originally bush had planned to keep the name a secret until 
next thursday the final day of the convention however his aides 
now fear that would steal too much thunder from bushs acceptance 
speech which is on the same day so they are considering moving 
the announcement up to wednesday 
obviously a consideration is a desire to maximize the 
suspense factor said a senior bush campaign aide speaking on 
condition of anonymity on the other hand there is a rule that you 
dont step on other relatively good stories such as the 
thursday night speech 
another campaign official also speaking anonymously said there 
was a lot of pressure to look at wednesday for an announcement 
in any event one of the aides said bush is enjoying this 
whole thing as suspense mounts over his choice 
there wont be any leaks of this one because im not gonna 
tell a soul and i havent so far bush said in a cbstv 
interview he said some stories on the subject are close to 
accurate and some of them are 180 degrees wrong 
private polls conducted by bushs campaign indicate that sen 
bob dole of kansas would give him more of a boost than any others 
in contention for the no 2 spot but not enough to make much of 
a difference said one aide 
a ticket of bush and bob dole ran stronger than a hypothetical 
ticket of bush and doles wife former transportation secretary 
elizabeth dole sources said 
i dont think there is anybody under consideration who 
guarantees a bush victory in any state or region said roger 
stone a republican consultant with ties to the bush campaign as 
for the timing of the announcement stone said i dont think it 
makes a whole lot of difference 
bush at an appearance with black supporters thursday declined 
to say whether he was considering lt gen colin l powell the 
first black ever to hold the post of national security adviser 
powell has been suggested by several newspaper columns and has 
been backed by rep jack kemp rny 
people who were contacted by bush and asked to provide 
financial data include both doles kemp and sens pete domenici 
of new mexico dan quayle of indiana and alan simpson of wyoming 
according to campaign aides 
sen nancy kassebaum of kansas rumored to be under 
consideration said on national television she wasnt interested in 
the job 
govs george deukmejian of california jim thompson of illinois 
john sununu of new hampshire carroll campbell of south carolina 
and former governor lamar alexander of tennessee were also among 
those on the original list of those under consideration the aides 
said deukmejian has since withdrawn his name from consideration 
sources suggested that no polling had been done on domenici 
suggesting that he may no longer be under active consideration 
meanwhile kemp said he has no expectations that hell get 
picked and is not sitting by the telephone waiting to be 
asked but he said he would naturally jump at the job 
quayle said he too would accept an offer 
moreover quayle said his inclusion on bushs list is not a 
political favor to focus attention on indianas junior senator 
i dont think thats the case he said the answer is no 
no capital no he said

of violence in which soldiers regularly opened fire on unarmed 
protesters many of them high school students or buddhist monks 
diplomats in rangoon say hundreds were killed and some estimates

george bush in a campaign pep talk friday to top administration 
officials and predicted americans wont gamble their future on a 
blind date in the november election 
were going to hold the white house with george bush reagan 
declared to about 250 cabinet and other top administration 
officials in a spirited preconvention sendoff for bush next door 
to the white house 
bush noting that many of the officials would be on the campaign 
trail on his behalf as surrogate speakers this fall said they must 
persuade voters that not just one election but a way of 
life is at stake 
i need you to march to victory again in november bush told 
the group of officials he called the field commanders of the 
reagan revolution 
he told them a victory by his democratic rival michael dukakis 
would totally reverse the successes of this administration 
it was bushs last scheduled campaign event before he goes to 
new orleans next tuesday he will appear again with reagan at an 
airport rally there before he is formally installed as his partys 
presidential nominee at the republican national convention 
in the meantime bush will continue working on his acceptance 
speech and make his final decision on a running mate although he 
has repeatedly said hell try to keep his choice secret until the 
convention is well under way 
reagan who spoke after bush told his audience some people 
may cast their vote this year to thank us for the last eight years 
but i suspect most people will vote for george bush this year 
bcause after voting for him once or twice before they know hes 
their guarantee that peace and prosperity today will be followed by 
peace and prosperity tomorrow 
and frankly reagan continued i dont think the american 
people want to gamble their future on a blind date 
it was the first time the two had spoken together in a public 
political setting since reagans endorsement of bush last may 11 at 
a republican fundraising dinner an appearance in which the 
president barely mentioned his vice presidents name 
however if that endorsement struck many as lukewarm the 
president made up for it in fridays rally in which he frequently 
mentioned bush as his partner in a great and continuing success 
story 
he referred to himself and bush as the malaise busters who 
brought eight years of steady change change for the better 
after the administration of democrat jimmy carter 
theres no way that america will turn back now reagan said 
george bushs policies work the other folks talk george bush 
will deliver reagan told cheering officials 
whos tending the store reagan jokingly asked the gathering 
of senior administration officials welcome to the white house 
complex he said white house complex thats what our 
opponents have after eight years of being out of power 
the president said he would be crisscrossing america this 
fall for bushs candidacy 
he also said his own agenda was still full and he called 
for congressional action on a uscanada free trade bill 
administrationbacked welfare legislation new aid for contra 
forces in nicaragua and a defense bill that supports his star wars 
strategic defense initiative 
weve got five full months ahead of us were going to 
continue to advance our programs and policies until we cross the 
finish line next january reagan said 
reagan handed bush a gavel at the conclusion of his speech 
saying i figure that with the convention coming up you can 
probably use that gavel if not there from experience i can tell 
you there will be a lot of meetings with the congressional 
leadership when you can use that 
the meeting was attended by cabinet and subcabinet officials 
who are exempt from a federal prohibition on campaigning that 
applies to lowerlevel federal bureaucrats 
bush said he was proud to be a part of this administration 
proud to serve this president 
we all know what will kill definitively kill this economic 
expansion weve worked so hard to create he said those same 
democrats the mcgovern or carter or mondale democrats are just 
itching to get their hands back on the levers that you operate so

hunters flocked to the heathercovered moors of 
scotland and northern england on friday the glorious twelfth of 
august and the start of the grousehunting season popular with 
landed gentry and wealthy tourists 
but the hunters gunfire was muted by declining stocks of the 
wild red grouse due to a parasite and vigorous protesters who 
drove the birds away with a predawn swoop on three grouse moors 
the hunt saboteurs association which opposes blood sports said 
about 300 members beat the hunters to the bushes and rousted the 
grouse at stanhope and gunnerside moors in northern england and in 
an area near muirshell country park in scotland 
ben ponton a spokesman for the protesters said they would 
remain on the moors all day he described their early success as 
the most glorious day in efforts to ban grousekilling 
it has become a glorious twelfth he said weve saved 
birds lives and thats glorious 
dukes and lords traditionally lead hunting parties on the 
glorious twelfth of august not to be confused with the 
glorious twelfth of july when protestants in northern ireland 
celebrate their victory over roman catholics in the battle of the 
boyne 
london restaurants which used to hire helicopters racecar 
drivers and airplanes in an informal competition to whisk the first 
grouse from the north to their tables have toned down the 
publicity stunts partly because of the protests 
i think over the last few years there has been very bad 
press said a spokesman for the hilton international hotel on 
londons fashionable park lane which ordered 10 grouse to serve 
friday night as a result a lot of hotels have not done as much 
promotion 
gourmets have always turned up their noses at the competition 
insisting grouse should hang for four r five days to bring out 
their true gamey taste 
the ritz hotel in londons piccadilly area said grouse would be 
on its menu friday night for about 60 a plate but it will be at 
its best next week 
most of our clients prefer it after its been hung for about a 
week a spokeswoman said 
passengers on dan airs 650 am flight from inverness 
scotland to londons heathrow airport were among the first to 
taste this years grouse 
grouse shot on a scottish estate before dawn was cooked at the 
golsview hotel in nairn driven to inverness airport four miles 
away and served on board 
the palatial gleneagles hotel in eastern scotland traditionally 
one of the frontrunners in the grouseserving race abstained for 
the fourth successive year because of the serious grouse decline 
said general manager peter lederer 
we feel we should do everything possible to preserve 
scotlands great sporting traditions in the interests of tourism as 
a whole and for environmental and ecological reasons in 
particular he said 
scotlands game conservancy says the grouse population has 
fallen steadily since the mid1970s because of disease and because 
their native habitats have been taken over as farmland 
grouse hunting is particularly popular among britains landed 
gentry and estate owners charge foreign tourists several hundred 
dollars a day to shoot on their land 
john sheard agent for the duke of devonshires northern england 
estate at bolton abbey said propects for this years grouse were 
not too good because a parasitic worm called the strongyle has 
weakened the stock 
a conservative lawmaker said the grouse season is also 
threatened by a european economic community proposal which would 
require that every bird in its member countries be inspected by a 
veterinarian within 48 hours of death the proposal is an effort to 
ensure that wild animals used for food are healthy 
the vet would need to remove the feathers and gut the bird not 
only delaying its passage to the dinner table but making it 
impossible to hang game in a traditional way 
such an order is fatuous dictatorial militaristic idiotic 
and totally unacceptable to great britain or to sportsmen or to 
anybody who has the brains of a grouse said sir nicholas 
fairbairn conservative member of parliament for perth and kinross 
in scotland

i talked to the family about it and i now believe that at this 
moment in the time of jim thompson and his family its not the

wholesale prices rose at a brisk annual rate 
of 57 percent in july despite smaller increases for food the 
government said friday in a report that intensified already 
deepening concerns about inflation 
the labor department said its producer price index which tracks 
prices for finished products one step before the retail level rose 
05 percent last month compared with a 04 percent increase in 
june 
but what alarmed analysts most about the july report was that 
unlike previous months the biggest increases were not in the 
normally highly volatile food and energy sectors but across a wide 
spectrum of consumer and capital goods 
drugs mens clothing tires soaps cosmetics home electronic 
equipment glassware tobacco products and construction equipment 
all rose at annualized inflation rates in the double digits in the 
past two months alone auto prices have climbed more than 15 
percent close to double digits if annualized 
these prices will slow down but something else will pick 
up the slack said donald ratajczak director of economic 
forecasting at georgia state university theres a lot of 
inflation kicking around 
ratajczak said the august figures when they come out next month 
will look even worse he predicted a monthly increase of 06 
percent or annual rate exceeding 7 percent as energy prices rebound 
and the impact of the farm belt drought wends its way through the 
food production process 
consumer food prices on the wholesale level rose just 04 
percent in july the price decline was led by falling meat costs as 
droughtplagued farmers and ranchers rushed their herds to 
slaughter rather than continue feeding them highcost grains 
the 04 percent gain compared with increases of 11 percent in 
june and 09 percent in may 
i july beef prices dropped 25 percent pork plummeted 105 
percent and fish prices edged down 07 percent 
prices for other food products affected by the drought such as 
fruits and poultry products continued to rise but at a slower pace 
than in june 
prices for fresh vegetables jumped 75 percent after declining 
57 percent in june and canned fruits and vegetables rose 13 
percent triple the rate of increase the previous month 
the drought is still not a major factor at the finished goods 
level but it will be ratajczak said thats whats worrisome 
peas are in trouble corns in trouble and that is why you seen 
these canned goods beginning to take off 
however he said the effect of the dry weather on consumer 
prices overall for the year will be only about onehalf of 1 
percent 
on thursday the agriculture department said consumer food 
prices alone will be pushed about 1 percent higher than they would 
have been had it not been for the drought 
energy prices after dropping 16 percent in june were stable 
last month as a 3 percent increase in the wholesale price for 
gasoline was offset by a 61 percent decline in home heating oil 
prices 
in a related report on the inflationary front the commerce 
department reported friday that business inventories rose 07 
percent in june despite a 15 percent increase in sales 
were beginning to see some inventory buying as an inflation 
hedge said allen sinai of the boston co a new york economic 
consultant when that happens it just adds to inflationary 
pressures its the old too many dollars chasing too few goods 
the june inventories plus the higher wholesale prices in july 
suggest that the economy is racheting up to a new higher plateau 
of inflation 5 percent to 6 percent at an annual rate a good 
deal sooner than 1989 as most had expected he said 
based on fridays wholesale price data sinai said he was 
revising his earlier prediction of consumer inflation in july from 
an annual rate of about 5 percent upward to about 6 percent the 
labor departments report on july consumer prices will be published 
aug 23 
president reagans spokesman marlin fitzwater said that 
despite fridays report officials at the white house still 
believe inflation remains low and under control 
fitzwater had said earlier this week that administration 
officials were disappointed that the federal reserve board had 
boosted the interest rate charged banks from 6 percent to 65 
percent in an effort to stem inflationary pressures 
however other private analysts who once shared the 
administrations view that inflation is not a serious problem yet 
said they were alarmed by the july wholesale price report 
theres no way of sugarcoating it the report was disturbing 
because the big increases in prices were outside food and energy 
said larry chimerine president of the wefa group an economic 
consultant in bala cynwyd pa 
it certainly makes what the fed did earlier this week look a 
little bit more prudent chimerine said the report somewhat 
overstates the underlying rate of inflation but clearly it is 
getting worse

british diplomat david reddaway said friday 
he will talk to iranian officials about foreign hostages held in 
lebanon by proiranian extremists 
reddaway arriving for what he said was a twoweek stay would 
not say which officials he planned to see saturday 
the staterun islamic republic news agency said reddaway would 
hold talks on mutual relations during a short visit it did not 
elaborate 
before leaving london reddaway said he would speak with 
officials about the 18 hostages who include anglican envoy terry 
waite two other britons and nine americans 
i think it is bound to help reddaway said the main thing 
i will be able to do is to remind the iranian government that 
we would hope that any government that could influence people 
holding hostages would do so 
several of the missing foreigners in lebanon are believed to be 
held by a proiranian group of shiite moslem extremists called 
hezbollah or party of god tehran wields considerable influence 
over the faction no group has claimed responsibility for 
kidnapping the three britons 
in addition to waite britain seeks the release of journalist 
john mccarthy and teacher brian keenan a belfast man with dual 
british and irish nationality whose release is also sought by the 
irish government 
the foreign office says it also seeks word on alec collett a 
new yorkbased british journalist whose palestinian abductors claim 
they killed him his body was never found 
reddaway is a first secretary at the foreign office while 
stationed in tehran in 1980 he helped britons escape from the 
besieged british embassy 
irna said he speaks fluent farsi and has an iranianborn wife 
his visit was not mentioned on the evening radio and television 
news programs 
iran has been making conciliatory statements about relations 
with western nations since it announced july 18 it was accepting a 
un call for a ceasefire in its 8yearold war with iraq 
irans only representative in britain charge daffaires 
mohammed basti said the hostage issue could be solved if all sides 
showed good will and his embassy announced it was sincerely trying 
to help 
a british official source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said basti has been told repeatedly that if iran is in a position 
to get freedom for the 18 foreign hostages in lebanon it should do 
so on humanitarian grounds 
in a way this a very blatant admission of involvement the 
source said 
he stressed the government would make no deals with iran and was 
not involved with the church of england talks there is no change 
and can be no change in our position that there will no deals 
iran also said it appreciated the efforts of archbishop of 
canterbury robert runcie who met in london on wednesday with a 
representative of the iranian foreign ministry from tehran 
church of england representatives met again friday with the 
official mohamed reza said mohamedi 
in july an anglican bishop went to lebanon to initiate 
inquiries among christians about the fate of four iranians who were 
believed kidnapped by christians in lebanon iran has repeatedly 
sought information on the four 
waite disappeared in lebanon in january 1987 while trying to 
secure the release of american hostages 
the longestheld hostage is american terry anderson 40 chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press he was seized 
march 16 1985 
relations between britain and iran have improved markedly in 
recent weeks 
britain closed its embassy and withdrew the ambassador from 
tehran in 1980 after revolutionary guards stormed the building 
denouncing britain as an ally of the united states 
last summer britain withdrew all its diplomats who worked out 
of the swedish embassy in tehran and virtually broke diplomatic 
relations 
the move came after a british diplomat was detained and beaten 
in apparent reprisal for british police arresting an iranian envoy 
on shoplifting charges 
on thursday the englishlanguage tehran times said 
speculation looms large that reddaway will visit briton roger 
cooper held in iran on espionage charges 
cooper 52 a nephew of the late british poet and novelist 
robert graves was arrested in december 1985 and held in tehrans 
evin prison 
the newspaper said with the arrival of reddaway britain took 
a giant stride in expansion of bilateral ties with iran

bernardine dohrn says she has few regrets about 
her activist past though she concedes the political movement of 
the 1960s was occasionally fraught with arrogance sexism and 
racism 
i was determined not to be like my mothers generation 
dohrn former leader of the weather underground and once listed on 
the fbis 10 most wanted list told an audience thursday at the 
downtown cultural center she said she had wanted no marriage no 
children 
but dohrns views have mellowed since she spent 11 years in 
hiding and served a sevenmonth prison term for refusing to 
cooperate with a grand jury investigation of a 1981 brinks armored 
truck robbery in which three people were killed 
dohrn 46 has married and has three children she lives in 
chicago working for childrens welfare issues with her husband 
william ayers also a onetime member of the weather underground who 
is now a teacher of education at the university of illinois at 
chicago 
remembering the past is a more revealing process than studying 
the present dohrn told her audience the appeal of the 60s 
protest movement comes from a simple notion that what you do 
makes a difference 
but dohrn said radical movements she was involved in were often 
chaotic inconsistent and messy 
in our militancy and intensity we somehow lost hold of what 
brought us into the movement in the first place a spirit of unity

another 15 minutes and it would have exploded said 
superintendent rp singh he said the device was detected after 
someone reported seeing a suspicious canister with a watch attached 
to it 
brar said a bomb exploded on a bus six miles south of chandigarh 
bound for the town of shazadpur in neighboring haryana state 
chandigarh is the joint capital of punjab and haryana states 
sikhs form only 2 percent of indias 800 million people but form 
a majority in punjab radicals have been agitating for an 
independent sikh homeland in punjab since 1982 claiming 
discrimination by hindus who form 80 percent of the population

caste prejudices have lessened since india gained independence 
in 1947 but divisions are more apparent in bihar the poorest 
state in india 
prejudices often erupt into violence there because many 
untouchables have joined marxist groups that agitate for 
distribution of land owned by uppercaste hindus

two british scientists flew to the soviet union on

monitoring station of soviet nuclear tests a colleague said 
jonathan doody and paul coward plan to set up the monitoring 
center at garm near the afghan border and 800 miles south of the 
main soviet nuclear test site at semipalatinsk said andrew parker 
a scientist who works with coward at leicester university doody 
works at glasgow university in scotland 
they hope their tests will help bring about a comprehensive 
nuclear test ban treaty by proving that it is possible to monitor 
even small nuclear explosions said parker 
opponents of such a treaty say that it could not be verifiable 
because they believe lowlevel nuclear explosions cannot always be 
detected 
doody and coward plan to be stationed at the garm center for two 
weeks after which they will be replaced by other british 
scientists said parker the center will be open for a year 
although us scientists have set up five seismic monitoring 
centers in the soviet union they are operated by soviets 
the british center will be created under an agreement between 
the soviet academy of sciences and the british seismic verification 
research project an independent group of scientists who want a

interest rates on new oneyear 
adjustablerate mortgages surged to the highest level in nine 
months this week while fixedrate mortgages jumped almost to the 
high point for the year according to a nationwide survey released 
friday 
the federal home loan mortgage corp a governmentchartered 
company owned by savings institutions and known as freddie mac 
said the oneyear adjustablerate mortgages this week averaged 
800 percent up from 790 percent the week before it was the 
highest since rates averaged 811 percent the week ending nov 6 
thirtyyear fixedrate mortgages jumped to 1057 percent from 
1044 percent the previous week that was just slightly below the 
high for the year so far 1058 percent the average for the 
weeks ending may 27 and june 3 
the jump in rates this week followed a move tuesday by the 
federal reserve board to push up interest rates to slow the economy 
and fight inflation 
economists predict a wide range of interest rates including 
mortgage rates will increase further this year 
fixedrate mortgages hit a peak just before the october stock 
market crash of 1158 percent as the fed pumped money into the 
economy to avoid a recession the average dropped to 984 percent 
in early february 
the increase since then means homebuyers taking out 100000 
mortgages now face about 670 more in annual costs than they would 
have on a fixedrate mortgage taken out six months ago 
thomas m holloway senior economist for the mortgage bankers 
association of america said fixedrate mortgages likely will rise 
another threequarters of a percentage point by the end of the year 
i think its going to slow down the housing sector but i 
dont think this is the death of the industry he said 
fixedrate mortgages have fluctuated widely over the past 
several years depending on financial market assessment of 
inflation dangers but the oneyear rate has stayed relatively low 
serving as an alternative for home buyers when fixed rates jump 
however adjustable rates now are also moving higher reflecting 
federal reserve tightening which has a more immediate effect on 
shortterm rates than on longterm rates 
in a separate report the federal home loan bank board which 
regulates federally insured savings institutions said fixedrate 
mortgages declined slightly from 1078 percent in early june to 
1073 percent in early july the dip followed three consecutive 
monthly increases 
unlike freddie mac averages the bank board numbers include 
addon fees known as points also the bank board averages do 
no reflect changes over the past month 
the bank board said rates including points for the most 
popular type of oneyear adjustablerate mortgages those with 
caps on how high the rates can increase rose for the third month 
in a row from 880 percent in early june to 886 percent in early 
july

angolan rebels killed 42 government 
troops in three clashes this week ignoring a ceasefire declared 
by angola cuba and south africa in the 13year angolan war the 
group said friday 
also on friday the official angolan news agency said angolan 
president jose eduardo dos santos and cuban diplomat jorge risquet 
met to discuss the ceasefire which was declared monday 
the news agency angop said the thurdsay meeting in luanda the 
angolan capital also covered several unspecified bilateral issues 
the report distributed in lisbon did not elaborate 
in a military statement distributed in lisbon the rebel union 
for the total independence of angola said it killed 10 soldiers 
wednesday in an ambush on an army battalion just northwest of 
kuemba in the central province of bie 
on tuesday rebels ambushed government troops on a road near 
tomboko in northwestern zaire province killing seven soldiers the 
statement said it said rebels killed 25 more soldiers monday in a 
battle near chipendo in the southwestern province of huila 
two guerrillas died and nine others were injured in the clashes 
the statement said 
there was no independent confirmation of the claims 
the rebels with the backing of south africa and the united 
states have fought since 1975 to force the cuban and sovietbacked 
marxist government to share power in the former portuguese colony 
they are not a party to the ceasefire 
mondays ceasefire was the first step in a threeway peace 
agreement to end war in the region achieve a withdrawal of cubas 
50000 troops in angola and create an independent state in 
neighboring southwest africa also known as namibia which now is 
controlled by south africa 
risquet is a member of the ruling cuban communist partys 
politburo and headed cubas delegation to ongoing peace talks 
between the three countries 
another round is set to be held later this month 
the peace accord also calls for the eventual withdrawal of 
cubas estimated 50000 troops in angola by a date still to be 
negotiated 
the rebels have demanded direct talks with the government 
angola has rejected that

a federal judge has agreed to extend the 
deadline for amnesty applications so that as many as 100000 
immigrants who failed to apply because of confusion over a 
restriction can seek legalization 
us district judge william d keller said at a hearing 
wednesday he would issue a formal ruling ordering the immigration 
and naturalization service to extend the amnesty program until nov 
30 for one group of immigrants 
his decision is aimed at immigrants including large numbers of 
asians europeans and south americans who were rejected or 
discouraged from applying because of an ins rule that initially 
disqualified people who traveled outside the country after the 
january 1982 amnestyeligibility deadline and then reentered with 
legal visas 
the ins rescinded the policy midway through the oneyear amnesty 
program 
we believe that thousands of people never heard of the change 
in ins policy and therefore did not apply for amnesty by the may 4 
1988 deadline said peter schey attorney for the national 
center for immigrants rights inc who filed the lawsuit last 
summer 
he estimates that the ruling could add as many as 100000 new 
amnesty applicants to the 18 million who applied before the first 
phase of the program ended may 5 
government attorneys who disputed scheys numbers said they 
may appeal kellers decision 
the case is one of several court challenges seeking similar 
extensions for different categories of immigrants who maintain they 
were wrongly left out of the process 
according to schey kellers ruling is the first since june when 
the supreme court ruled in a case concerning filipino world war ii 
veterans against courts extending deadlines imposed by congress 
in a related case a federal judge in sacramento on wednesday 
reinstated an amnesty extension for immigrants who traveled outside 
the united states during the amnesty application period without ins 
permission 
us district judge lawrence karlton had stayed an extension he 
granted in june as a result of the supreme court ruling schey said 
this court ruling says that despite that supreme court case 
the federal courts do have the power to extend the deadline he 
said 
government lawyers remain unconvinced however 
the ins position is that the court doesnt have the 
jurisdiction to order this extension said assistant us 
attorney george wu who represented the ins in the case

paul getty museum have been removed from display after an 
investigator said they fit the descriptions of pieces stolen from 
an excavation in italy 10 years ago 
two marble heads and associated hands and feet were removed from 
the museums magna grecia gallery museum spokeswoman lori starr 
said thursday 
earlier this week italian magistrate silvio raffiotta told the

from an archaeological site in morgantina sicily and that he 
believed pieces of stolen statuary a face hands and feet had 
turned up in the getty museum 
no one has presented any evidence to us that they are from 
morgantina starr said however she said the museum removed the 
pieces because they may fit the description of objects allegedly 
stolen from the morgantina site 
the museum does not own the pieces ms starr said adding that 
they have been on loan from a private collector and will be 
returned to the collector 
according to terms of the loan agreement the museum cannot 
reveal the lenders name she said raffiotta has not indicated the

agrigento sicily alleged that a fifthcentury bc classical 
greek statue believed to be that of the greek goddess aphrodite

allegations have triggered an investigation by italian authorities 
and interpol the parisbased international police agency 
that 7foot statue unveiled by getty last month is said to be 
the only acrolithic figure that has survived relatively intact from 
head to foot acrolithic figures are composed of separately carved

palestinian governmentinexile currently under discussion in the 
palestine liberation organization

to the west bank which jordan ruled from 1948 until 1967 when the 
area was captured by israel 
staterun jordan radio said only that fridays meeting centered 
on issues of mutual concern 
the plo official who spoke on condition of anoymity said the 
two sides discussed the status of jordanian passports held by 
palestinians the rights of employees in the occupied territories 
recently fired by jordan and the implications of these measures 
on the future of palestinians 
hussein has scrapped a 13 billion development plan for the 
west bank and gaza strip cancelled the salaries of 21200 local 
employees and dissolved the lower house of parliament half of 
whose 60 members represented the west bank 
but the king has not yet anounced a decision on the validity of 
jordanian passports held by most of the 850000 west bank 
palestinians

a federal judge said friday the new fraud and 
conspiracy trial of lyndon larouche and his associates could last 
at least a year but the defense said it would try to block 
proceedings from starting in october 
at a hearing in us district court lawyers for the political 
extremist said they would appeal judge robert e keetons decision 
ordering a new trial 
defense lawyers also said they would seek more information about 
a february 1985 memo from fbi executive assistant director oliver 
revell to thenfbi director william webster regarding an bomb 
threat against former secretary of state henry kissinger that 
allegedly involved larouche affiliates 
larouche six aides and five political organizations are charged 
with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into 
allegations that larouches 1984 presidential campaign raised more 
than 2 million through credit card and loan fraud 
keeton who ordered the new trial thursday three months after 
declaring a mistrial said he plans to schedule daylong daily 
sessions starting oct 3 and prescreen jurors to guard against 
complaints about the trials length 
in light of my estimate that this trial is going to last a 
year or longer its important to get in as many hours per day as 
possible keeton said 
the first trial which began last december was suspended in 
march for hearings into government documents referring to larouche 
those included a memo from retired air force maj gen richard 
secord to thennational security council aide oliver north 
nowdeclassified fbi documents on informationgathering against 
larouche and other fbi cia and nsc records 
the defense has maintained that the fbi and cia infiltrated 
larouche organizations to fabricate evidence of fraud 
keeton halted all proceedings in may after excusing four jurors 
who complained about the length and conduct of the case that left 
only 10 jurors out of the original 12 and two alternates and the 
defense exercised its right not to continue with fewer than 12 
assistant us attorney john markham said the fbis 1985 memo 
and a 1982 telex about a bomb threat against kissinger were 
irrelevant to the fraud and conspiracy charges 
larouche attorney daniel alcorn said the document was pertinent 
because it was written after the government began its fraud 
investigation of larouche and could be used as evidence to prove 
the government set up larouche 
the defense friday also withdrew motions to divide the case into 
separate trials for the credit card fraud loan fraud and 
conspiracy charges attorneys said separate trials could have 
prolonged the case even more because some witnesses would be called 
three or four times 
markham said he expects the prosecution will produce 75 hours of 
direct testimony adding crossexamination by defense attorneys 
markham estimated the case would take 300 hours or about 3 months 
defense lawyers who in the first trial raised some issues 
several times refused to estimate how long their case would take 
michael riley one of about a dozen larouche attorneys said 
defendants would ask the federal appeals court to delay the trial 
until their appeal is heard 
the defense last month charged prosecutors with intentionally 
causing the mistrial because its case was going nowhere 
defendants had claimed a new trial would violate their fifth 
amendment rights against being tried twice on the same charges 
larouche who is seeking the presidency a fourth time is 
charged with one count of conspiracy for allegedly ordering 
supporters to destroy records and refuse to cooperate with 
investigators all six aides and the five organizations also are 
charged with conspiracy and four of the groups are charged with 
fraud

the coast guards busiest drug interdiction team is 
delighted to have a share of 60 million in emergency money and 
ready to stir it up with the opposition a coast guard official 
said friday 
theres nothing worse than being on a ship that wont get 
under way said capt john linnon chief of staff of the seventh 
coast guard district which stretches from south carolina georgia 
florida and the caribbean to mexicos yucatan peninsula 
the people in the coast guard are happy to get back to work 
were ready to stir it up with the opposition he said 
congress on thursday shifted 60 million to the coast guard to 
help restore a variety of operations cut last winter the shift was 
part of a 672 million emergency spending bill 
im delighted with this action the seventh district 
commander rear adm martin h daniell said in a statement now 
we can get our planes back in the air and our cutters out to sea 
where they can do their job 
the budget fight is not over linnon said standing in front 
of the polished white cutters at the coast guards base miami 
beach the 60 million is what we need to finish out the fiscal 
year 
linnon said the seventh district the busiest in drug 
intervention efforts had to cut to three of the biggest 
deepwater cutters per day and had seen seizures drop by half from 
january to august now the district will be able to put to sea six 
or seven cutters 
the district had already started to increase patrols in 
anticipation of the budget shift 
weve proven over the years that it increased activity makes 
a difference he said 
the money will be spread among all 10 of coast guard districts 
and will go toward a variety of needs including resuming training 
replenishing spare parts carrying out deferred maintenance and 
resuming patrols linnon said he hasnt seen how the money will be 
distributed but more than 25 percent of district 7s budget is 
spent on stopping drug traffic 
i see this as an excellent signal that the congress will 
support the presidents coast guard budget for the upcoming fiscal 
year said adm paul a yost commandant of the coast guard 
now that we have the 60 million we are ready to charge ahead 
in january the coast guard said it was being forced to cut back 
antidrug efforts by 55 percent because of a shortage of money the 
impact of the cuts was most sharply felt in the southeast because 
90 percent of all coast guard seizures are made in the waters off 
florida georgia south carolina and the caribbean basin officials 
said 
during the cutback the coast guard averaged about 100 cutter 
days per month in district 7 but that number could double with the 
additional money 
during the cutback the coast guard had continued to respond to 
reports of suspicious activity on the seas but had cut back on 
routine patrols

a prominent historian and an editor 
published open letters friday urging the reformist soviet weekly 
moscow news to condemn what they characterized as repression in 
romania 
when human rights are trampled underfoot it cannot be seen as 
just an internal affair whether this happens in south africa 
chile or romania wrote historian miklos kun the son of bela 
kun who led the abortive soviet republic established in hungary in 
1919 
by what title do we condemn racial persecution dictatorial 
regimes around the world if in a romania that belongs to the 
socialist camp there is not even the semblance of democracy kun 
asked 
he took issue with a moscow news article on the dispute between 
warsaw pact allies hungary and romania over the alleged 
discrimination against ethnic hungarians living in romania 
the article published in a july edition of the soviet weekly 
was careful not to take sides in the dispute 
but kun said he considers it incorrect that the weekly 
does not raise its voice against romanian arbitrariness 
romania is socialisms last bastion of the cult of personality 
he said painting a dismal picture of alleged repression there 
kuns letter was published in the aug 14 edition of new mirror 
along with a similar letter from the weeklys editor sandor 
fekete who said he hoped moscow news would drop its neutral stance 
he said an open informative press should be able to express its 
opinion even if the soviet government stays out of the 
hungarianromanian dispute 
moscow news recently started publishing a hungarianlanguage 
edition

the nicaraguan government is withholding 
approval of the names the state department has submitted as 
replacements for eight us envoys who were expelled by sandinista 
authorities last month a spokesman said friday 
other officials said the administration does not intend to 
replace ambassador richard melton who was among those expelled 
but instead plans to send kenneth skoug head of the state 
departments office of cuban affairs to run the embassy 
as embassy charge daffairs skoug would not require senate 
confirmation the officials speaking only on condition they not be 
named said it was doubtful that any ambassadorial nominee could 
receive senate confirmation before congressional adjournment on 
oct 8 
they said sandinista refusal to approve the envoys proposed as 
replacements apparently was in retaliation for the us expulsion 
of nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann who served as chief 
envoy to both the united states and the organization of american 
states 
nicaragua maintains that the administration acted beyond its 
authority in expelling a diplomat accredited to the oas 
state department spokesman charles redman said a usnicaraguan 
agreement calls for a reply to be given on visa applications for 
diplomats assigned to either countrys embassy within five days of 
the visa request 
the nicaraguan foreign ministry informed the us embassy in 
managua that this provision of the agreement had been suspended and 
that both the agreement and the us visa requests were under 
review redman said 
stalling on the issuance of visas indicates the sandinista 
regime wishes to prevent the us embassy from functioning 
normally redman said 
on july 11 nicaragua ordered the seven american diplomats to 
leave the country within 72 hours charging that they had been 
interfering in nicaraguas internal affairs by encouraging 
antigovernment protests 
the state department denied that the diplomats had acted 
improperly and ordered tunnermann and seven of his colleagues home 
it said tunnermann had engaged in unspecified illegal activities 
during his us stsy and that a us agreement with the oas 
permitted the united states to expel any oas diplomat guilty of 
such behavior

a former premier who was purged after 
the 1956 uprising and expelled from the communist party says he and 
other stalinist leaders of the 1950s should have been called to 
account for their deeds then 
the political weekly kepes 7 carried excerpts of andras 
hegedues memoirs in its aug 13 issue available in budapest on 
friday 
the magazine said the memoirs are to be published by the 
communist party publishing house kossuth and that hegedues has been 
allowed to resume teaching indicating he has been rehabilitated 
hegedues 66 was a political outcast for years because of his 
critical stand toward the regime and the party 
he was premier under the stalinist leader matyas rakosi in 1955 
and kept the post when imre nagy pioneer of the 1956 revolt took 
over the party leadership from rakosi in 1956 
hegedues was purged after the revolt was put down by soviet 
tanks in november 1956 but was able to find refuge in moscow 
returning to hungary in 1958 
he said he considers it an historical injustice that most of 
the leading persons of the early 1950s including myself got 
off unscathed we were never called to account 
but he also criticized nagy who was executed in 1958 
imre nagy committed a mistake by taking a political step in 
1956 which at that time looked impermissible in the east european 
context hegedues was quoted as saying 
nagy had promised to establish a multiparty system and announced 
hungarys withdrawal from the sovietled warsaw pact alliance and 
called on the west for support of a neutral hungary 
the revolt began oct 23 1956 with mass demonstrations for a 
new government and demands that soviet troops leave hungary on 
nov 4 200000 soviet troops and 2500 tanks entered budapest to 
quell the uprising 
the uprising was sparked by popular revulsion for rakosis 
repressive regime 
hegedues indicated it was clear at the time that nagy was 
destined to fail because he was trying to implement such radical 
changes when the soviets vested full powers over him 
hegedues said the revolt was a memento for politicians and 
the public rather than a model that should be followed 
if nagy instead had become premier and janos kadar had taken 
over the party from rakosi in 1956 we would certainly have 
avoided the uprising hegedues said 
kadar called for soviet assistance in 1956 and was party leader 
from then until last may when he was replaced by premier karoly 
grosz 
hegedues has called for reforms in hungary including greater 
pluralism in society and more autonomy for social insititutions

jesse jackson won an extension friday of a 
temporary court order barring a suburban company from selling or 
distributing videotapes of his democratic national convention 
speech 
us district judge james b zagel extended a temporary ban and 
indicated he would issue a preliminary injunction tuesday barring 
mpi home video from profiting from the former presidential 
candidates speech until the whole issue can be decided at trial 
the case is set to go to trial aug 30 unless the two sides 
reach agreement said henry mason a jackson attorney 
im pleased with the result mason said he ruled in our 
favor on a preliminary basis 
but eric cohen an attorney for oak forestbased mpi said he 
would appeal and declined further comment 
jackson who was not in court friday contends the tape 
exploited his name and literary and oratorical skills and hurt his 
livelihoood by diminishing his chances of selling his own tape of 
the speech 
in his ruling zagel agreed saying there is more than 
negligible probability that jackson earns part of his living 
on his oratory he added that even the defendants acknowledged 
their videotape will hurt anything jackson tries to sell 
mpi president waleed b ali and his attorneys argue that mpi 
didnt need jacksons authorization because his hourlong speech 
july 19 in atlanta was a news event unprotected by federal 
copyright law mpi paid abc for the rights to its coverage 
but zagel said the speech is an original literary work the 
judge added that the fact that jackson had waited to copyright the 
speech until after he learned of alis enterprise was insignificant 
ali said thursday that he was motivated to make the tape by 
money and the events historic importance 
i thought we had a hotseller ali testified 
as for the suggestion that he should have obtained jacksons 
permission before selling the tapes he said why should our 
medium be singled out as the only medium to get approval

sophies choice is mayor sophie masloffs 
theme for her antilitter campaign but people familiar with the 
book and film of the same name say the slogan is in poor taste 
william styrons book told the story of a polish woman sent to a 
world war ii concentration camp who was forced by the nazis to 
choose which of her two children would be killed 
i love sophie dearly i wish she had chosen another slogan by 
virtue of the fact it can raise an issue said richard marcovitz 
rabbi at congregation bnai israel 
i think it was in bad taste said councilwoman michelle 
madoff 
the reason it doesnt bother me is i know sophie masloff 
personally and i know the furthest thing from her mind would be 
anything that in the least bit would have any negative 
implications said stanley ruskin chairman of the pittsburgh 
chapter of the american jewish committee 
its just a catch phrase thats why i chose it not for any 
significance at all the mayor said thursday 
this sophies choice might not win an academy award but its 
my no 1 priority said mrs masloff 
the cleanup campaign includes buying new street sweeping 
machines setting out additional trash containers paving 70 miles 
of city streets this year and cleaning every vacant city lot by 
october

mississippi legislators worked friday to 
pass anticorruption legislation inspired by an fbi investigation 
that led to guilty verdicts against dozens of county officials but 
the house and senate were not in agreement 
the federal investigation into corrupt county purchasing 
practices has resulted in charges ranging from extortion to mail 
fraud against 56 supervisors in 25 counties of those 42 have 
pleaded guilty six have been convicted one has been acquitted 
one died before going to trial one died after sentencing and 
another was declared mentally incompetent to stand trial the 
remaining ones still have charges pending 
the state senate prepared friday to consider its version of a 
county government reorganization bill approval of which would 
require negotiations between that chamber and the house 
the house passed a measure friday dealing with purchasing laws 
the lawmakers were in their third day of a special session 
called by gov ray mabus who took office in january pushing county 
government reform as one of the four main goals of his first 
legislative session the house and senate were unable to agree on a 
bill during their 120day regular session earlier this year 
mabus was state auditor for the four years before he was elected 
governor and he assisted the fbi in its operation pretense 
investigation of corrupt county purchasing 
the county reorganization bill was endorsed friday by the senate 
county affairs committee after it substituted language in a measure 
passed thursday by the house with that proposed by state sen eddie 
briggs of dekalb 
state sen bill renick of ashland said the house version was 
merely the bill that we saw during the regular session he 
said it was heinous then its heinous now 
mabus has claimed the beat system still in use in 60 of 
mississippis 82 counties invites public officials to steal under 
that system supervisors maintain control over daily operations in 
their individual districts 
mabus has pushed for a law that would require counties to adopt 
the socalled county unit system under which the five county 
supervisors would set policy and hire an administrator to oversee 
daytoday operations 
the purchasing law measure passed 1180 friday by the house 
would allow governmental bodies to buy items costing less than 500 
and not have to follow the purchase prices set by the state office 
of general services through competitive bids 
the senate judiciary committee worked friday to incorporate 
purchasing law revisions in the senate version of the county unit 
bill 
the senate version of the bill differs in several ways from that 
approved by the house although both would mandate central 
purchasing and inventory control systems for counties 
both would provide for referendums in each county allowing 
voters to decide if their counties would construct and maintain 
roads on a centralized basis although the versions would word the 
question differently 
the senate provisions would allow counties to hire 
administrators but would not require them to do so the chancery 
clerk could agree to serve as county administrator or as 
purchasing or receiving clerk the house language would mandate 
hiring of an administrator 
both bills would require road managers for counties choosing 
central road construction and maintenance the senate version would 
prohibit the county engineer from serving as county road manager 
both versions would require separate clerks for purchasing 
receiving and inventory control but lawmakers have said those 
could come from existing personnel 
the 1988 legislative session ended with threemember negotiating 
teams from the house and senate refusing to budge in areas where 
the chambers differed killing the county unit legislation mabus 
then vetoed a bill that would have given 20 percent pay raises to 
the states 410 supervisors

a controversial montana law prohibiting the 
questioning of voters outside polling places violates the us 
constitution the state attorney general acknowledged friday 
but mike greely representing the state in a lawsuit filed 
against it by nbc asked us district judge charles lovell to 
leave intact the remainder of the law which bans any questioning 
of voters in a polling place itself 
in a brief filed in federal court greely acknowledged the 
prohibition of exit polling is constitutionally invalid and 
said it should be stricken from the statute 
but he added it is constitutionally permissible for the 
defendants to enforce the statute to the extent it prohibits 
solicitation of an elector within a polling place or any building 
in which an election is being held 
the proposal to eliminate the disputed language submitted by 
assistant attorney general patricia schaeffer came in a case filed 
by nbc just before montanas june 7 primary election 
exit polling is used by television networks to project winners 
in elections before votes are counted 
the late secretary of state jim waltermire had pushed for the 
ban after the 1980 presidential election in which networks 
predicted ronald reagan would win before polls closed in montana 
on june 3 four days before the montana primary judge lovell 
granted nbcs request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the 
state from enforcing the ban 
at that time lovell said the law is seemingly a broadside 
attack upon significant traditional and cherished first amendment 
freedoms

supporters of former republican candidate pat 
robertson were talking unity friday after months of wrangling with 
the bush campaign over delegations to the gop national convention 
aides to the television evangelist said his name will not be 
placed in nomination against vice president george bush and they 
promised no more than traditional convention floor demonstrations 
when robertson delivers his primetime address tuesday night 
his speech will focus on many of the issues robertson has 
stressed during the campaign including foreign policy and moral 
values 
and there will be a call for unity said barbara n 
gattullo director of communications for americans for robertson 
she said there are no plans to put his name in nomination he 
will release his delegates 
robertson who suspended his campaign on may 16 has 93 
delegates according to the associated press survey vice president 
george bush has 1998 delegates many more than the 1139 needed to 
nominate 
the former presidential candidate who has returned to the 
christian broadcasting network also will campaign for bush in the 
fall ms gattullo said 
the talk of party unity comes after bitter fights in states such 
as michigan and georgia over representation for robertson 
supporters in the state parties and the delegations attending the 
convention 
the michigan battle was resolved prior to the republican 
gathering this week the bush and robertson campaigns settled their 
dispute in georgia on wednesday with robertson supporters gaining 
28 of the states 48 delegate seats 
the solution to georgias fierce fight was still being hailed by 
the robertson people on friday 
georgia was a matter of definition said ms gattullo 
theres a feeling of harmony because of the fair treatment of 
the georgia delegation said marc nuttle former campaign manager 
for robertson 
later nuttle called the georgia resolution the bellwether in 
making the republican party the party of the 1990s 
nuttles comments came as he released results of a survey of 250 
robertson supporters conducted immediately after the democratic 
national convention it found 69 percent definitely or at least 
probably supporting bush to 17 percent for dukakis with the rest 
undecided 
sixtysix percent said they would vote for bush even if they 
learned that he had had full knowledge of the irancontra affair 
bushs selection of a vice president a major concern among 
conservative groups may affect support for the republican nominee 
according to nuttle but only if the choice is a liberal 
there is a wide range of tolerance for vice president 
nuttle said theres no evidence to indicate its a volatile 
issue

the federal aviation administration plans to 
accelerate the certification of fixedwing aircraft capable of 
taking off and landing vertically so they might be available for 
civilian use by the mid1990s officials said friday 
the socalled tiltrotor aircraft technology which is under 
development by the military is seen by some aviation industry 
experts as a key to providing shorthaul air transportation in the 
future 
faa adminstrator allan mcator one of the governments chief 
boosters of the technology told reporters friday that the 
potential civilian uses for the tiltrotor aircraft is virtually 
limitless 
he suggested it would be ideal for shorthaul flights in areas 
ranging from the congested skies of the northeast and southern 
california to the isolated airfields of alaska 
other aviation experts however suggest that the use of such 
planes which are expected to cost at least 20 million apiece and 
carry only 24 to 30 people per flight would be too high to be 
economically successful in the near future 
the tiltrotor aircraft is envisioned as being capable of 
landing and taking off like a helicopter and having a range of more 
than 300 miles when its rotors are tilted for fixedwing flight 
mcartor said the faa has entered into a memorandum of 
understanding with the defense department to share development 
information on the tiltrotor aircraft program so that once the 
military version is developed it may be adapted quickly for 
civilian use 
faa officials estimated the agreement will shorten the time it 
takes to certify such a plane for civilian use by as much as eight 
years mcartor estimated that the military version will be ready 
for certification by 1992 and the civilian version three years 
later 
six prototypes of the tiltrotor craft already have been built 
for the defense department by an industry team that includes bell 
helicopter textron boeing helicopter and allison engine division 
of general motors officials said 
the faa also announced that it has awarded the port authority of 
new yorknew jersey a 585000 grant to conduct a study that would 
determine where best to locate special landing and takeoff sites 
for such aircraft additional grants are expected to be provided 
shortly in other parts of the country mcartor said 
stephen berger executive director of the port authority 
estimated that as many as 8 million business travelers might use 
such an aircraft annually if routes are established that would take 
them from the downtowns of one city to another 
faa officials acknowledged more studies will be needed to 
determine the actual market potential the cost per seat mile of 
such aircraft and how such aircraft would be integrated into the 
next centurys air transportation system 
eventually faa planners envision tiltrotor aircraft being used 
extensively by commuter airlines to transport business travelers in 
areas where capacity at conventional airports is increasingly 
limited 
in the northeast says joseph del balzo the faas regional 
administrator in new york a tiltrotor aircraft eventually could 
take business travelers from downtown manhattan to downtown 
washington in 45 minutes

a federal judge removed from a ku klux 
klan case by an appeals court said friday he wants to hear from the 
nations top civil rights enforcer before deciding to remove 
himself from all government cases 
us district judge william m acker jr during a hearing on 
his own fitness for trial in government cases said he did not know 
how he will rule eventually 
but he said i have made my mind up that i am not going to 
rule on my motion to recuse until i hear from william bradford 
reynolds director of the civil rights division of the justice 
department 
the us attorney in birmingham said earlier the justice 
department would not take part in fridays hearing and would not 
seek ackers blanket removal from federal government cases 
the justice department is involved in two longrunning civil 
rights cases in alabama one involving the ku klux klan and the 
other involving allegations of segregation at the states colleges 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals removed acker from the 
klan case saying his position against the government had become 
hardened acker 60 was appointed to the bench in 1982 by 
president reagan 
by luck of the draw however acker this week was assigned the 
school case after the appeals court removed us district judge 
uw clemon the first black federal judge in alabama te appeals 
court said clemon could not be impartial because he had championed 
desegregation efforts as a state senator and civil rights attorney 
since the justice department urged the appeals court to remove 
him from the klan case acker said he wants to know whether 
reynolds will object if he hears the school case the justice 
department had joined in the suit which alleges race bias exists 
in higher education programs and funding 
i presume the 11th circuit court is reasonable acker said 
friday they say im partial if a reasonable person thinks im 
partial should i sit on federal cases 
clemon appointed to the bench by president carter in 1980 was 
among the spectators during ackers hearing on his own motion for 
recusal but did not comment three attorneys who are not involved 
in either case did offer testimony that they had found acker to be 
fair and impartial when they had matters before him 
clemon said earliers this week that he was the victim of a 
double standard demeaning to black federal jurists 
acker said he had invited responses from a wide variety of legal 
and judicial organizations and individuals but had received only 
one from us attorney frank donaldson of birmingham in which 
donaldson said the united states has at this time insufficient 
information to determine and no reason to believe that judge 
ackers proposed general recusal is either necessary or 
appropriate

the summers unrelenting heat finally wore 
down gov tommy g thompsons resistance to airconditioning the 
capitol 
thompson who had vetoed a budget item for installation of air 
conditioning said friday he was acquiescing 
the governors surprise backing followed a facetious suggestion 
from rep marlin schneider that impeachment proceedings might begin 
if thompson refused to budge 
statehouse employees were elated 
i think its wonderful said dianne mccaughy a secretary 
for assembly minority leader betty jo nelsen 
outside the governors conference room where thompson made his 
announcement the mercury climbed to the 90degree mark for the 
30th day this summer that was only 11 days short of a record set 
in the mid1930s the weather service said 
several times this summer when the temperature soared the 
assembly has allowed workers in rooms that lacked window air 
conditioners to take the afternooon off 
thompson whose personal office has a room air conditioner as do 
a number of legislators offices told reporters he encountered a 
woman in the capitol thursday who told him she would be glad to 
pay higher taxes for air conditioning in the building 
ive acquiesced thompson said 
schneider said fears among the public that air conditioning the 
70yearold capitol would lead to even lengthier legislative 
sessions is absolutely ridiculous 
the reality he said is that workers productivity drops in the 
summertime because the building is so hot and uncomfortable 
schneider estimated that the project could cost as much as 6 
million about 1000 people work in the building he said

former gov evan mecham predicts hell be 
voted back into office by an electorate disgusted with the way he 
was hounded from office by the states political establishment 
in a book titled impeachment the arizona conspiracy mecham 
claims the real reason he was impeached and convicted of wrongdoing 
in office was pure and simple raw political power exercised by 
those groups who wanted to remain in control 
mecham had the book printed privately and began selling it 
thursday for 295 
it was clear that they senators who voted to convict did not 
make that decision based on evidence the former governor wrote 
the senate convicted mecham on april 4 of misusing 80000 from 
the governors protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership 
and of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat 
mecham predicted public dissatisfaction with the impeachment 
would lead to changes in the legislatures makeup this fall 
adding that should pave the way to win back the governorship 
again the next gubernatorial election is in november 1990 with 
the winner to take office in january 1991 
in may mecham was acquitted of criminal charges accusing him of 
concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
in the final analysis my error was not in what i did with the 
protocol funds but in thinking i was dealing with people who had 
honor integrity and the best interest of the state at heart 
mecham said in the book 
on thursday attorney general bob corbin filed a civil suit 
asking that mecham be forced to turn over the 80000 remaining in 
the protocol fund to the state mecham has insisted the fund is 
private money and is seeking to return it to the donors himself 
in his book mecham repeated his contention that some 
establishment lawmakers corbin the media and business leaders 
banded together in a conspiracy to drive him from office 
but he said they had only partly succeeded adding they have 
not been able to fool all of the people in arizona into believing 
that mecham was terrible for arizona a racial bigot or a mindless 
buffoon illsuited to be governor

a deactivated reactor from the nations 
first nuclear power plant will be floated down the ohio river in 
october on its way to a nuclear waste depository in washington 
state officials said 
the reactor to be removed from the deactivated shippingport 
atomic power station about 35 miles northwest of pittsburgh is 
expected to be unloaded in february at the hanford nuclear 
reservation in southcentral washington 
the barge will go down the ohio to the mississippi river into 
the gulf of mexico through the panama canal and up the pacific 
coast 
although the reactor has been emptied of its nuclear fuel 
filled with concrete and enclosed in a neutronshield tank its 
classified as nuclear waste since it has been contaminated by 
radiation 
there has never been a plant this large decommissioned in this 
country said david ney a nuclear engineer for the pennsylvania 
department of environmental resources its probably the largest 
single shipment of nuclear waste in the nations history 
mike molloy executive director of disaster and emergency 
services in kentucky said thursday that his agency hasnt received 
word of the shipment to hanford 
mike mckernan a technology transfer program manager for 
westinghousehanford co said the company would inform states

technical support contractor for shippingport 
the concretefilled reactor and its enclosing shield mckernan 
said together about 1000 tons and measures about 45 feet high and 
18 feet across 
you can stand on it all day long and you wouldnt come in 
contact with more radiation than if you were standing out in the 
sun mckernan said 
the plant commissioned in 1957 was the nations first 
commercial nuclear power plant the federal department of energy 
and duquesne light the pittsburghbased power company operated 
the plant as a demonstration project they began taking the plant 
out of service four years ago 
by june the nuclear core was removed and the middle of the

to steam was filled with concrete 
the department of energy is charged with disposing of the 
reactor and converting the property owned by duquesne light to 
a perfectly usable condition mckernan said pennsylvania

a controversial plan to provide free sterile 
needles to drug addicts will begin in november as authorities try 
to stem the spread of aids among drug abusers the city health 
commissioner said friday 
there were problems with law enforcement agencies but weve 
worked those bugs out said dr stephen c joseph who expects 
the program to start in about 10 weeks they now agree with us 
that this is not an illegal program 
the state health department approved the experiment this week 
joseph said the progam will involve 200 addicts and last six to 
nine months 
thats enough time for us to get a fair amount of data to 
enable us to draw some conclusions joseph said if something 
goes wrong if we are mistaken we can stop things at any time 
needles are already distributed in several other countries but 
no government agency in the united states has such a program a 
social service agency in portland ore however announced plans 
in june to begin a needle distribution program but the program has 
been held up 
the use of dirty needles has become the leading method of 
infection among new cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in 
new york city 
if the new york experiment is a success city officials hope to 
broaden distribution among the citys estimated 200000 intravenous 
drug abusers sample blood tests indicate about half of that group 
are already infected with the aids virus 
some prosecutors and leaders of the black community are among 
those who oppose the needle plan saying it will promote illicit 
drug abuse 
the end is commendable of course said manhattan borough 
president david dinkins but i maintain that drug use is 
unacceptable and i do not accept the notion that we can make drugs 
safer

george bush reviewed the names of potential 
running mates with senior advisers friday asking a few questions 
about a few people but said he has not made up his mind a 
campaign source said 
he indicated he has not narrowed it the source said we 
talked about individuals hes still asking questions and seeking 
information 
the source insisting on anonymity said bush told his advisers 
he thought he would make his decision before he flies to new 
orleans on tuesday for the republican convention but wasnt sure of 
that 
meanwhile illinois gov james r thompson one of more than a 
dozen people said to be under consideration called bush on friday 
to ask that his name be withdrawn citing his family 
the vice presidents job requires a lot of national and 
international travel thompson said my wife couldnt travel 
with me because ive got a 10yearold in school and thats not 
true of the other candidates 
bush is spending the weekend in washington mulling his choice 
and working on the speech he will deliver thursday night in 
accepting the republican presidential nomination on his arrival 
here tuesday bush will join president reagan at an airport 
ceremony and then get on a boat to cross the mississippi river for 
a welcoming rally downtown 
leaders of bushs campaign assembled at his headquarters in 
washington at 7 am friday to talk with the vice president about 
his search for a running mate 
the group included craig fuller his chief of staff campaign 
manager lee atwater pollster robert teeter media adviser roger 
ailes press secretary sheila tate former sen nicholas brady 
nominated last week to be treasury secretary longtime texas friend 
robert mosbacher 
bush gave no clue about his preference the source said he 
asked a few questions about a few people hes seeking more 
information he hasnt made a decision and hes unwilling to say 
when he will the source refused to say who was discussed or how 
many names were reviewed 
afterward atwater flew to new orleans for final preparations 
for the convention 
among bushs staff there were differing opinions on whether he 
actually has made up his mind but just isnt telling anyone one 
official insisting on anonymity expressed the view that bush 
knows who he wants but is holding it back until the last minute 
gov john sununu of new hampshire one of the prospects said he 
thought bush should keep it a secret until wednesday or thursday 
gop chairman frank fahrenkopf said he is trying to persuade the 
bush forces it would be best to announce the running mate choice on 
wednesday night after the convention nominates bush as reagan did 
in 1980 when he chose bush 
fahrenkopf in an interview said that making the announcement 
on thursday would undercut the news value of bushs speech to the 
convention thursday night it would put the only two big news 
stories of the convention in competition with each other for 
fridays front pages 
fahrenkopf said he would favor having bush come to the 
convention hall thank the delegates for nominating him and then 
ask their support for his vice presidential choice 
meanwhile rep lynn martin rill a cochair of bushs 
campaign who has been mentioned as a possible running mate 
declined to say if she had been asked if she wanted to be

an international medical conference 
on friday declared a campaign against disease that involves 
training doctors in preventive care rather than waiting for their 
patients to become ill 
man needs more than science alone said a statement issued 
by the world conference on medical education after a fiveday 
meeting in the old college of edinburgh university 
the conference was attended by 160 doctors and health 
specialists and released the edinburgh declaration that was adopted 
unanimously 
it said in part that medical educators must produce doctors 
who will promote the health of all people not merely deliver 
curative services to those who can afford it or to those for whom 
it is readily available 
thousands suffer and die every day from diseases which are 
preventable curable or selfinflicted and millions have no ready 
access to health care of any kind the declaration said 
such facts have produced a mounting concern in medical 
education about equity in health care the humane delivery of 
health services and the cost to society 
the declaration was supported by representatives of three united 
nations agencies the world health organization the united nations 
childrens fund unicef and the un development program 
national ministries of health and education universities and 
such funding institutions as the rockefeller gulbenkian and 
kellogg foundations and the world bank helped finance the 
conference 
the message from this meeting is quite clear urgent reform of 
medical training is needed in all countries so that doctors involve 
their patients in keeping themselves well said henry walton an 
edinburgh university psychiatrist and president of the world 
federation for medical education 
he said the steps to reform doctors training will be monitored 
by offices in six regions africa the americas europe the 
middle east western pacific and southeast asia 
with backing from the governmentfunded scottish development 
agency a site for the central office has been offered by the city 
of edinburgh 
walton said the central office will have a staff of about eight 
and an annual budget of 289000 followup conferences are 
scheduled in washington next month and lisbon portugal at the end 
of october he said 
we want doctors everywhere to concentrate on how to encourage 
people to take care of themselves said dr george miller from 
clinton ny former head of the center for educational 
development at the university of illinois 
we want medical graduates to meet the needs of the people and 
not be content with curing diseases he said 
dr james grant executive director of unicef said more than 
two thirds of the 14 million deaths of children each year were 
caused by such diseases as diarrhea measles tetanus whooping 
cough and respiratory infection and the victims could have been 
protected at low cost 
grant said 50000 people die prematurely every day from causes 
that could be readily prevented 
we have the technology to dramatically improve the health of 
people over the next 20 years but will medical education play 
its role grant asked 
eleanor mclaughlin the mayor of edinburgh told the closing 
session we do need hightechnology medicine but ordinary people 
everywhere know what they want to keep healthy to feed their 
families and to have a city system that gives them clean water i 
know it will be a battle to get those things it always has been

pakistan long troubled by the naval buildup 
of archfoe india has struck a deal to lease up to eight of the 16 
us navy frigates that are being retired for budgetary reasons 
officials said friday 
the deal outlined to congress on thursday makes all the more 
final the pentagons grudging decision early this spring to suspend 
the reagan administrations drive for a 600ship navy 
although the ships are being leased and not sold to pakistan 
and can be recalled if needed by the navy it would probably 
take a war for us to ask for them back said one official who 
asked not to be identified 
lt barbara kent a navy spokeswoman said congress was informed 
of the deal in a letter from rear adm thomas c lynch the navys 
chief of legislative affairs congress has 30 days to block the 
transaction if it wishes to do so she said 
the spokeswoman said pakistan would be allowed to inspect nine 
frigates according to another official who asked not to be named 
however pakistani officials have been told they can lease a 
maximum of eight ships 
a top congressional aide who also requested anonymity said 
congress was unlikely to intervene because the decision has 
already been made to cut back the us fleet 
the decision was made up here not to keep these ships in 
service because of the cost of operating them so if pakistan wants 
to take on that expense we have no objection the aide said 
the ships because of their age and boiler plants require a 
disproportionate number of sailors to operate compared with modern 
warships 
according to lt kent pakistan has yet to say exactly how many 
frigates it wants the navy assuming congress goes along will 
begin allowing pakistani inspections of nine frigates in october 
she said 
the navy declined friday to say how much pakistan would pay for 
the warships 
but according to figures compiled by the defense security 
assistance agency the highest rental fee that pakistan would be 
charged for eight frigates would be 631 million per year 
pakistan is being offered an initial fiveyear lease on the 
ships but any agreement can be terminated at any time the 
navy spokeswoman said 
she identified the nine ships to be offered to the pakistanis as 
the brooke ramsey schofield talbot page bradley edward 
mcdonnell ocallahan and sample 
the brooke ramsey schofield bradley and ocallahan are based 
in san diego calif the talbot and edward mcdonnell are based in 
mayport fla while the page is based in norfolk va and the 
sample in pearl harbor hawaii 
the deal with pakistan is being struck five months after india 
leased a nuclearpowered attack submarine from the soviet union for 
its navy 
the indian navy is getting to be a powerful force said one 
pentagon source pakistan is naturally concerned and theyre 
prepared to put forward the manpower needed to operate these 
ships 
the american frigates being offered to pakistan are of the 
socalled garcia and brooke classes they were built in the 
mid1960s 
defense secretary frank c carlucci announced early this year in 
unveiling the pentagons fiscal 1989 budget plan he had ordered the 
navy to retire the 16 frigates he said the move was just one of 
several designed to shrink us military forces rather than 
maintain a hollow force that wasnt ready to fight 
that decision was stridently criticized by navy secretary james 
h webb who resigned in protest in february 
two months ago the navy announced it would decommission the 
first 10 of the frigates by the end of this year and the remaining 
six in 1989 
the 16 ships are operated by more than 5100 sailors

chiles military rulers gave no sign 
friday of accepting a roman catholic church proposal that they 
negotiate with the opposition about the nominee for the october 
presidential referendum 
gen fernando matthei chief of the air force told a news 
conference the idea was interesting but indicated he does not 
plan such negotiations before the commanders meet aug 30 to select 
the nominee president augusto pinochet the army commander is 
expected to be their choice 
ill take it into account when we meet in 18 days matthei 
said 
adm jose merino the navy commander said after the proposal 
was made thursday that its too late for an accord with the 
opposition 
pinochet the army commander indirectly rejected the bishops 
proposal in an address to businessmen thursday he said his 
government would abide by the 1980 constitution which says the 
commanders of the three armed forces and the national police will 
make the nomination 
bishops of the episcopal conference recommended negotiations 
because chile is becoming polarized and radicalized and the 
referendum might result in a virtual tie unless the opposition 
accepts the nominee whose name will be alone on the ballot 
leaders of an opposition alliance formed to promote a no 
vote in the referendum expressed willingness to negotiate about a 
choice 
if the nominee gets a majority of the yesorno vote he will 
begin an eightyear term in march if he loses pinochet is to 
remain in office until an open presidential election in 1990 
pinochet 72 led a coup in september 1973 that ousted the late 
president salvador allende an elected marxist

final consideration of the uscanada free trade 
agreement began friday with parliamentary debate on one of 102 
amendments proposed by opposition parties trying to scuttle it 
the agreement which would scrap all duties over a 10year 
period and reduce nontariff barriers was proposed by prime 
minister brian mulroney and accepted late last year by the reagan 
administration 
it is scheduled to take effect jan 1 but mulroney now faces a 
much tougher job than president reagan to getting the agreement 
ratified 
enabling legislation passed the us house of representatives on 
tuesday by a vote of 36640 and the senate is expected to give its 
approval next month 
in canada the main opposition liberal party and the socialist 
new democratic party claim the agreement jeopardizes canadian 
resources and could change the nations way of life 
they want mulroney leader of the conservative party to call a 
general election which in effect would let the voters decide 
whether the it should be accepted 
mulroney need not call an election until his fiveyear term 
expires in 12 months but canadian governments generally seek a new 
mandate after about four years he said this this week he wants 
free trade and other key legislation passed before he considers an 
election date 
his conservatives are expected to use their large majority in 
the house of commons to cut delaying tactics short next week and 
secure a third and final reading of the measure next week 
the bill could get bogged down in the senate canadas appointed 
second chamber that has a liberal majority liberal leader john 
turner has asked the senate to delay the bill until an election 
fridays debate in the commons began with a liberal amendment 
noting that the pact does not define canadian boundaries 
especially disputed waters in the arctic the government dismissed 
the amendment as frivolous and refused to join the debate 
rep john lafalce a democrat from niagara falls ny and a 
freetrade supporter told congress this week a major trade war 
could start if canada does not ratify the accord 
david peterson the liberal premier of ontario responded 
its the largest trading partnership in the world im not saying 
there wouldnt be some hard feelings but that would pass

to make drug trafficking and drug abuse public enemy no 1 
supreme court justice antonin scalia one of the conservative 
jurists appointed to the court by president reagan administered 
the oath of office to thornburgh in the roosevelt room of the white 
house 
reagan saluted thornburgh as an exprosecutor with a 
nationwide reputation for attacking the drug problem head on and 
cracking down on drug traffickers 
thornburgh succeeds outgoing attorney general edwin meese iii 
who resigned after saying he had been vindicated by an independent 
counsel investigation of his affairs 
reagan paid tribute to work done in the drug area by by both 
meese andd vice president george bush the prospective republican 
presidential nominee 
under vice president bushs leadership federal state and 
local law enforcement officials have been working together as never 
before to stop drug runners from smuggling illegal drugs into the 
united states he said 
the results of that work and the work that attorney general 
meese led are incredible 
bush was present at the swearingin ceremony but meese did not 
attend 
thornburgh swore his oath on a bible once owned by william penn 
the founder of pennsylvania it was held by his wife virginia 
i firmly believe that unless we sustain a vigorous effort to 
make drug trafficking and drug abuse public enemy no 1 we could 
well stunt significantly the capacity of todays young people to 
contribute to a better quality of life for tomorrows america 
thornburgh said 
he said said he would use every resource of the department of 
justice consistent with strict observance of the civil rights and 
civil liberties of all our citizens to fight other unique threats 
to our traditional values 
thornburgh 56 was confirmed by the senate late thursday 
meeses ethical behavior was investigated by independent counsel 
james mckay who concluded that the attorney general probably 
broke the law but decided not to seek his indictment meese denied 
any improprieties and maintained that the department was running 
normally despite defections by top aides during his final months as 
attorney general 
thornburgh headed the justice departments criminal division 
during the ford administration in the mid1970s and established the 
public integrity section that prosecutes corrupt public officials

a fouralarm chemical fire closed two 
busy highways near san jose and produced clouds of noxious smoke 
that injured at least three people before firefighters brought it 
under control authorities said 
a passing motorist was overcome by smoke and taken to a hospital 
for treatment said san jose police sgt jim morin a firefighter 
and a police officer also inhaled fumes and required treatment he 
said 
the blaze was triggered by a small explosion at altus corp a 
battery manufacturer about 1 pm and about 200 employees were 
evacuated said jack meral a company vice president 
he said clouds of smoke which also forced the evacuation of 
some nearby small businesses were produced by the burning of a 
chemical called thionylchloride and hydrochloric acid 
essentially breathing the smoke might cause some repiratory 
distress burning in nasal passages a cough irritation of the 
eyes said johnna anderson of the san jose poison control center 
it could cause problems for asthmatics or those with lung or 
heart problems 
she said that those who might have suffered a severe exposure to 
the fumes could find themselves coming down with pneumonia or other 
viral or bacterial infections a few days or weeks later 
when that delicate lining of the nose or mouth is burned the 
body has no more protection against infection she said 
the blaze was controlled around 215 pm officials said 
the highway patrol said interstate 880 and highway 101 near san 
jose were closed temporarily a massive traffic jam ensued with 
motorists backed up for about 15 miles 
at san jose international airport a few miles away landings and 
takeoffs were only slightly affected said spokeswoman marily mora 
several thousand people visiting great america amusement park

canadas health minister said friday 
his staff is ready to investigate why emergency workers at a 1985 
plane crash that killed 248 us military personnel now complain of 
mysterious health problems 
union official robert cox said firefighters transport workers 
police and other rescuers have shown signs of a rare blood disorder 
and other health problems since the crash 
he said they believe the blood disorder could be related to 
toxic fumes at at the site 
the crash of a chartered jet at gander on dec 12 1985 was the 
worst ever in canada 
in addition to the 248 troops from the us armys 101st 
airborne division it killed the eight crew members en on the dc8 
operated arrow air of miami a charter company specializing in 
military passenger transport the soldiers were returning from a 
tour with peacekeeping forces in the middle east 
about 50 workers requested the investigation at a meeting 
organized thursday night by their union the public service 
alliance of canada 
we are serving notice to the government of canada you have 
the responsibility to your employees to identify what the 
problem is cox said 
without an independent medical examination of everyone at the 
crash site it will be difficult to prove the ailments are linked 
to the disaster he said 
don boudria an opposition liberal party member of parliament 
said at least 24 rescue workers were suffering strange maladies and 
a full inquiry should be made 
health minister jake epp said friday in ottawa his department 
will conduct tests and do whatever is medically necessary when 
it gets a formal request from the union 
the plane refueled in gander and crashed soon after takeoff a 
preliminary report by the canadian aviation safety board said 
failure to deice the wings was the probable cause but members of 
parliament and other sources said the confidential report omitted 
evidence of a possible onboard explosion or fire 
we have doctors reports for some workers that say toxins were 
present but there is no proof that it was from the crash cox 
said 
he said thursdays union meeting established that a very high 
percentage of people involved in the arrow air crash are now 
experiencing medical problems of a similar nature 
the problems included high enzyme counts blood problems and 
cardiovascular problems cox said there definitely has to be a 
link there somewhere

the government recognized a foundation 
conceived by solidarity pointing to a softening of its stand on 
activists of the outlawed independent trade movement one of the 
movements leaders said thursday 
however zbigniew bujak said the labor movement still faces 
major obstacles in regaining legal status bujak led solidarity in 
the warsaw region until the movement was banned after martial law 
was imposed in december 1981 
in an unexpected move the government earlier this week approved 
registration of a foundation conceived by bujak and other 
solidarity leaders to help large families in need bujak said 
i was completely surprised i didnt expect such a decision 
its certainly connected with a general trend of change toward 
solidarity activists he said 
bujak said government registration of a health care foundation 
now being organized by solidarity leader lech walesa would 
represent an even greater step in the trade groups efforts to 
regain legal status 
registration of lechs foundation connected even in name with 
solidarity will be a huge step toward legalization of the whole 
solidarity said bujak 
the foundations plans to operate three health care clinics have

republicans approved convention rule changes 
friday they hope will get them more exposure on television 
dispensing with needless roll call votes and allowing governors and 
members of congress on the convention floor 
unlike the democrats republicans do not automatically give 
delegate status to highranking elected officials and under 
current rules the convention floor seating is restricted to the 
delegates 
rep robert dornan rcalif said it would be good to let the 
politicians be seated on the floor of the convention so they could 
rub elbows with the backbone of the party 
but its the reporters and the tv cameras that the politicians 
are interested in 
thats where the press is said rep tom delay rtexas who 
sponsored the change to allow the politicians to have nonvoting 
seats on the convention floor thats what we need to get 
elected 
the rule change if given final approval by the entire 
convention would not take effect until 1992 
the other change which would dispense with an hourlong roll 
call for the vice presidential nomination if there is just one 
candidate was designed to conserve precious prime time on the tv 
that rule change requested by vice president bushs campaign 
takes immediate effect if approved by the convention and would 
allow the republicans to forego a thursday night roll call next 
week

anticommunist afghan guerrillas have 
captured kunduz a strategic provincial capital in northeastern 
afghanistan according to an unconfirmed report cited friday by 
western diplomats 
the moslem insurgents who usually are the first to publicize 
their takeovers of afghan towns even when they are temporary have 
said nothing about capturing kunduz the capital of kunduz province 
kunduz about 150 miles north of the afghan capital of kabul 
would be a significant gain for the guerrillas fighting the 
sovietbacked government 
the city 40 miles south of the soviet border on the main 
highway leading from kabul to the soviet union would be the first 
afghan provincial capital the rebels have won in the 10year war 
most soviet troops leaving the country under an april 14 
unsponsored withdrawal agreement are taking another road to the 
border at heiratan about 100 miles west of kunduz 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 and have been 
helping the marxist government battle the guerrillas the soviets 
agreed to withdraw half their estimated 100000 troops by monday 
under a pullout plan that began may 15 and is to be completed by 
feb 15 
staterun radio kabul said foreign journalists and local afghans 
witnessed hundreds of red army soldiers cross into the soviet 
union on thursday and friday 
the radio reported that a pakistani national was arrested 
thursday for espionage as he carried two explosive devices in the 
eastern city of jalalabad the governmentcontrolled bakhtar news 
agency said the unidentified pakistani led afghan army forces to a 
guerrilla ammunition depot in caprahar six miles south of 
jalalabad 
radio kabul also said two pakistanis were among 70 people killed 
during a clash between afghan army troops and usbacked moslem 
guerrillas in eastern logar province there was no information on 
when the fighting occurred 
it described the two pakistanis as advisers to the 
guerrillas 
azim nasser zia of the national islamic front of afghanistan 
resistance organization said guerrillas who arrived about 10 days 
ago from kunduz said nothing of the capitals capture or its 
vulnerability to an imminent guerrilla takeover 
the afghan news agency which claims to be a mouthpiece of the 
sevenparty guerrilla alliance but is operated by members of 
gulbadin hekmatyars hezbeislami also could not confirm the 
capture of kunduz the loose and often fractured resistance 
alliance is based in peshawar in northwest pakistan 
a strategic gain in afghanistans resourcerich north would 
dampen any hopes the afghan government might have for the north as 
a fallback position if it is unable to hold kabul 
western diplomats said kabul might have designs on the north 
after the government began heavy construction in the northern city 
of mazaresharif appointed a deputy prime minister for the north 
and consolidated its fighting forces under a single command 
afghan insurgents temporarily captured two provincial capitals 
in southern and eastern afghanistan since the soviet withdrawal 
began but they were pushed back after heavy bombing attacks 
western diplomats said 
pakistan which has an estimated 25 million afghan refugees as 
well as guerrilla headquarters signed the withdrawal agreement in 
geneva with the afghan government the united states which backs 
the insurgency and the soviet union agreed to act as guarantors 
the insurgents have said they will ignore the geneva accord and 
keep fighting until the government falls 
pakistans foreign minister sahabzada yaqub khan said friday 
that pakistan is fully committed to the agreement and a political 
settlement in afghanistan 
he said soviet accusations pakistan had violated the accord were 
false motivated and propagandist the soviets have accused 
pakistan of continuing to channel weapons to the guerrillas 
khan said the accord carries the promise of the complete 
withdrawal of foreign forces from afghanistan the return of peace 
and independence and the safe return of refugees

gov mario cuomo said friday that he may 
yet remove from office the yonkers city councilmen who are defying 
a federal judge over an order to promote racial integration by 
building 800 units of affordable housing 
we certainly will not rule out removal by any means the 
governor said after meetings with the yonkers naacp and the 
editorial board of the gannett westchester rockland newspapers 
federal and state officials such as sens daniel patrick 
moynihan and alfonse damato should help persuade yonkers to build 
both low and moderateincome housing cuomo said 
the people of yonkers have to have leadership locally and 
otherwise that shows them the way that shows them they can have 
this housing that shows them they can do the right thing by the 
poor people without threatening their own property the governor 
said 
no one needs to suffer a loss to find housing for 200 families 
in a city as great as yonkers he said yonkers the states 
fourthlargest city has a population of 195000 
if an appeals court upholds a contempt finding next week he 
said the recalcitrant council members should consider resigning 
cuomo said his role would be defined by us district judge 
leonard sand who found the city liable for segregating housing and 
schools for 40 years 
its his jurisdiction the governor said 
sand also found the city and four councilmen in contempt for 
failing to endorse a resolution to build 800 units of affordable 
housing to break the pattern of segregation 
each councilman was fined 500 daily the city was fined 100 a 
day with fines to double daily by the 22nd day of the fines the 
city would face the total elimination of its 337 million budget 
but a threejudge appeals panel stayed the fines pending a full 
hearing on the contempt order next week 
cuomo said he wanted to await the outcome of the appeals court 
before taking any action to remove elected officials is a lengthy 
process he observed 
earlier this week the yonkers emergency financial control 
board imposed to oversee city spending four years ago as a 
condition of a bailout to stave off bankruptcy assumed the reins 
of city spending 
it could find the officials in violation of the control board 
act and set into motion a removal process said cuomo however he 
stopped short of saying it would

an abc news poll friday put the presidential 
race at 49 percent for george bush to 46 percent for michael 
dukakis an evaporation of dukakis big postdemocratic convention 
lead 
the survey wednesday and thursday of 384 likely registered 
voters had a relatively high margin of sampling error 6 percentage 
points meaning the race was statistically a dead heat 
four other national polls released this week showed support for 
dukakis dropping off from its peak after last months democratic 
convention in atlanta with leads for the massachusetts governor 
ranging from 6 points to 14 points 
dukakis boosted by good publicity led by as many as 18 points 
the week after the convention michael dukakis did as well as you 
can out of a convention said jeff alderman abcs chief 
pollster its not surprising that would shrink 
alderman said the abc survey found most of bushs growth in 
support among voters who identified themselves as independents he 
said their movement reflected an ambivalence about the candidates 
fifteen to 20 percent of the electorate is lightly attached to 
either of these candidates and those voters are capable of 
swinging back and forth he said either one could be ahead

israeli troops friday fired on three 
palestinians attacking with chains clubs and an ax in the occupied 
gaza strip killing one assailant and wounding another in the leg 
the army said 
leaders of israels two major political parties intensified 
debate on the future of the west bank and gaza strip after king 
husseins decision to cut jordans ties with palestinians in the 
occupied lands 
fridays clash began shortly after midnight in gazas mughazi 
refugee camp an army spokesman said he said the dead man riad 
suleiman abu mandil 23 had participated in antiisraeli protests 
and attacks on soldiers in the past 
the death brought to 240 the number of palestinians killed since 
the arab rebellion in the occupied lands began dec 8 four 
israelis also have been killed 
israeli military officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said troops apparently caught the arabs by surprise as they were 
painting antiisraeli slogans on camp walls the officials said 
soldiers opened fire when the palestinians attacked the troops with 
clubs chains and an ax 
they said mandil fled from the army patrol after being wounded 
and may have bled to death an autopsy was ordered 
troops also arrested the third member of the palestinian group 
the officials said 
in an interview with israels armed forces radio foreign 
minister shimon peres said israel had to decide in elections nov 1 
to pursue peace before arguing about the choice of an arab 
negotiating partner 
what does israel want to take a peace initiative or to sit 
idly and let the arabs and the russians and the whole world run our 
affairs if we do not take the initiative and thats actually 
what the likud proposes others will take it warned peres the 
head of the liberal labor party 
peres said he still believed jordan had to be a negotiating 
partner despite husseins declaration that he will not bargain on 
behalf of the palestinians 
we have always thought we should conduct negotiations both 
with jordan and the palestinians as jordan is responsible for the 
main border and the palestinians are the ones who bear the main 
burden of the palestinian problem peres said 
in an interview with the jerusalem post daily industry minister 
ariel sharon of the rightwing likud bloc argued the only 
realistic policy was to consider jordan a palestinian state since 
most of its 35 million people are palestinians 
we have to object in the strongest possible way to attempts to 
foist on us a second palestinian state to our east sharon said 
sharon who has a wide following among israels hardliners 
proposed that israel annex portions of the west bank and gaza 
strip saying most israelis agree that much of the territory is 
needed for security reasons 
prime minister yitzhak shamir has ruled out repeated calls by 
rightwingers to annex the west bank in response to husseins 
measures 
prime minister zaid rifai of jordan met in amman with a 
highlevel palestine liberation organization delegation to discuss 
jordans move to cut ties with the occupied lands 
a senior plo official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
they discussed jordanian passports held by palestinians the rights 
of employees in the occupied territories dismissed by jordan and 
the implications of these measures on the future of 
palestinians 
plo chief yasser arafat met with libyan leader col moammar 
gadhafi in tripoli the official libyan news agency jana said 
the agency monitored in rome said the two leaders discussed 
financial aid for palestinians in the occupied lands gadhafi said 
this week that libya will pay the salaries of 21200 palestinian 
officials who had been paid by jordan

the last temptation of christ opened in 
nine cities friday amid tight security that included guards 
standing as sentries alongside movie screens and theater patrons 
being searched 
thousands of christians furiously objected to the film saying 
it depicts jesus as filled with doubts and lust while some critics 
praised it as a masterpiece 
filmgoers snaked around streets by the thousands for tickets to 
the first showings vastly outnumbering the protesters who turned 
out in several cities 
uniformed security guards checked purses and bags of movie 
patrons in new york los angeles and toronto and guards also stood 
alongside screens in those cities but no disturbances were 
reported 
in new york rabbi yosef friedman an orthodox jew carried a 
sign in front of the ziegfeld theater that read rabbis protest 
mockery of any religion while in chicago about 50 demonstrators 
gathered 
about 30 protesters in washington dc waved placards and 
marched behind a mannequin of jesus while dozens of demonstrators 
gathered outside theaters in san francisco and chicago 
although a demonstration by 25000 christians at universal 
studios was peaceful and polite thursday 75 los angeles police 
officers monitored the crowds at the century plaza theater and 
security guards checked purses and bags of movie patrons 
police cmdr william booth said no officers will be in the 
theater in century city despite fears of slashed or spraypainted 
screens 
vandals tossed balloons filled with paint at the century city 
theater about 5 am splattering it with yellow paint said 
security guard fabian munez by noon someone had spread glue on 
the floor in the womens rest room said patron jo drott 24 
hours before the film was to open a group of directors 
including warren beatty james l brooks peter bogdanovich 
michael mann sydney pollack and walter hill called a news 
conference to express support for the films director martin 
scorsese 
we owe a debt of gratitude to this group of somewhat misguided 
zealots the film now will be seen by a lot of curiosityseekers 
said john badham director of short circuit and wargames 
what is not terrific is their effort to rewrite the bill of 
rights 
the directors guild of america was the latest group to enter the 
fray which has spread from the studio lots to congress to churches 
nationwide 
protesters have declaimed the film as sacrilege saying it 
portrays christ as a deranged and lustdriven human who while 
being crucified dreams he marries and has sex with mary magdalene 
and lives his life as an ordinary man 
cardinal bernard law the roman catholic archbishop of boston 
urged catholics to boycott the film calling it morally offensive 
and repugnant to christian belief 
it is inconceivable to me that a person of faith in jesus 
christ would go to this movie law wrote in the archdiocese 
newspaper one way to be heard is by not going another way is to 
write the producers 
but proponents say the film illustrates the central mystery of 
christianity showing a fully human jesus wrestling with doubts and 
temptation then rising above them to accept his role as gods son 
willingly crucified so the rest of humanity may be forgiven its sin 
willem dafoe who portrays jesus in the film said he is baffled 
by protesters complaints 
i just think this is a beautiful powerful positive film 
some people that for the most part havent seen it are coming out 
against it that i dont understand he said in an interview on 
nbctvs today program 
universal studios has accused the protesters of censorship for 
asking the studio to destroy the film in a suprise move the 
studio moved up the release date from sept 23 to friday saying it 
wanted the public to judge the movie for itself but perhaps also 
wishing to capitalize on the publicity 
church leaders opposing the movie have primarily been protestant 
evangelicals and conservative catholics many of whom have refused 
to watch it the mormon church also condemned the film friday 
saying it trivializes the message and mission of jesus christ 
other christian leaders such as the episcopal bishop of new 
york said after a screening that they had no objections to the 
release of the movie and some said it was an enlightening or 
educational tool 
film critics also had mixed opinions some calling it 
overwrought and boring at two hours 40 minutes others calling it 
the most impressive biblical epic ever 
richard corliss of time magazine said scorsese may have 
created his masterpiece while michael medved of sneak 
previews said it was ironic that so much controversy could be 
generated by a movie this awful 
the movie opened friday in nine major markets los angeles 
chicago washington san francisco seattle minneapolis new york 
toronto and montreal universal spokesman said no decision has been 
made whether to add other cities next week 
several movie chains have refused to book the film including 
the newton massbased general cinema theaters the nations 
fourthlargest movie chain with 1338 screens in 318 locations the 
company refused to say why however 
on friday the wometco exhibition chain which has more than 90 
screens in florida said it also had chosen not to screen the film 
garth drabinsky chairman of torontobased cineplex odeon which 
is showing the film and is codistributor said supression of the 
film would signal the beginning of the decline and fall of the 
motion picture industry 
scorsese a roman catholic says his film is an affirmation of 
faith that he hoped would provoke people to think about jesus as a 
man confronting temptation 
based on the 1955 novel by nikos kazantzakis which was 
denounced as heresy by the greek orthodox church last 
temptation has had a long journey to the big screen director 
sidney lumet acquired the rights to the novel in 1971 but abandoned 
the project because of difficulties in writing the screenplay 
barbara hershey who plays mary magdalene urged scorsese to 
read the novel while she was filming boxcar bertha with him in 
1972 and that began his 15year quest to make the movie 
during the journey such actors as robert deniro eric roberts 
aidan quinn and even sylvester stallone were suggested for the role 
of jesus

at least eight radio stations with antennas on the building were 
temporarily knocked off the air by the fire 
the fire broke out about 1 pm in a utility room on the 86th 
floor of the skyscraper and spread up a shaft to the top floor the 
fire department said 
three firefighters required treatment for heat and smoke in the 
93degree weather and one was taken to a hospital said fire 
spokesman john mulligan one building occupant suffered a cut on 
the arm but declined threatment he said 
it was really nothing unusual just very smoky and very 
hot said homer bishop acting fire chief 
there was no general evacuation and no one was trapped but 
people from the smokier upper floors were brought out elevator 
service was not disrupted 
some 1500 tourists visiting the popular observation decks on 
the 86th and 102nd floors were among those told to leave the 
building said nick cavatoro a spokesman for the building owners 
he said the decks would reopen saturday 
fifth avenue traffic was backed up for more than 20 blocks north 
of 34th street the fire department had 40 trucks and 125 
firefighters at the scene 
there was lots and lots of smoke but thats all it was 
coming out the vents said tracie ricks who works on the 65th 
floor 
everyone was kind of nervous but there was no problem getting 
out said a coworker karen mial 
bishop described damage as moderate in the utility shaft 
george wolfson general manager and vice president of wltwfm 
said the eight radio stations knocked off the air resumed 
broadcasting by 6 pm at reduced power he said they would remain 
at reduced power until burned transmission lines were repaired 
the 86th floor blaze was under control at 143 pm the fire 
department said but five minutes later fire was discovered on the 
top floor 
efforts to put it out were stymied for a time by lack of 
pressure because a pump on the 84th floor was not working properly 
officials said 
the greatest difficulty up there was the extreme heat and 
humidity a sweatsoaked firefighter mark keisey said as he 
left the skyscraper at times it felt like we were on our last 
legs 
the empire state building is probably bestknown as the site 
where movie ape king kong made his last stand 
its most serious reallife disaster occurred july 28 1945 when 
a us army b25 bomber lost over manhattan in fog crashed into 
the buildings 79th floor three plane crewmen and 11 civilians 
died and 26 were injured as flaming gasoline bathed the 78th and 
79th floors that saturday 
the structure built in 193031 for years was the tallest

george bush and michael dukakis swapped charges on the economy 
friday while republicans finessed a disagreement over star wars in 
completing a conservative platform the vice president will take 
from next weeks new orleans convention into the fall campaign 
gop chairman frank fahrenkopf said the platform reflected bushs 
call for a new direction in some areas still he added 
were a conservative political party were proud of that were 
not afraid of the c word 
but leslie dach a top aide to dukakis said in boston the 
republicans had produced a rightwing platform mired in the 
past 
bush met privately with advisers to discuss topic no 1 on the 
minds of republicans his choice of a running mate but offered 
no public clue in illinois gov jim thompson announced he did not 
wish to be considered for the post 
the vice presidents job requires a lot of national and 
international travel he said my wife couldnt travel with me 
because ive got a 10yearold in school 
an abc poll reported bush and dukakis in a statistical dead 
heat with bush at 49 percent support and dukakis at 46 a margin 
smaller than the polls sixpoint margin of error several other 
polls this week have reported dukakis leading although by less 
than in the days following the democratic convention 
both bush and dukakis were pointing their efforts toward next 
week the vice president by previewing the convention themes of 
peace and prosperity and his democratic rival by airing the first 
television commercials of the fall campaign in texas and california 
in a bid to take the sting out of an attack the gop will launch 
against him from new orleans 
fahrenkopf urged bush to make a dramatic announcement of his 
choice of a running mate wednesday night after the convention 
bestows its presidential nomination bush has been saying he would 
wait until thursday morning to announce his decision and would not 
tell a soul in advance 
bush campaigning in washington told reagan administration 
loyalists he stands for low taxes and high opportunity for all 
and accused democrats of favoring policies that would doom the 
economic recovery dukakis completing a fivestate campaign sweep 
fired back that republican borrowing and spending caused this 
weeks rise in interest rates 
dukakis said climbing interest rates were an irresponsibility 
tax forced on americans by deficit spending of the reagan era 
we deserve an explanation from the republicans at that 
convention about what theyre doing to the american people he 
said 
heat humidity and elephants of all shapes and sizes were in 
abundance in the convention city where republicans will flock next 
week to nominate bush and his vice presidential partner one red 
white and blue inflated plastic pachyderm was anchored atop a hotel 
overlooking the vast superdome convention hall 
the politicians werent the only ones looking forward to the 
convention there are going to be a lot of men at this 
convention they said so itll be good for us said bonnie 
holloway a dancer at a new orleans gogo club 
republican platform writers completed a 30000 work blueprint 
for the future that they said was far more specific than the one 
approved by the democrats last month officials released a list of 
125 issues that they said democrats had ignored 
republicans sidestepped a dispute over star wars when the bush 
forces agreed to accept a draft penned by conservatives that called 
for rapid and certain deployment of the missile defense system 
the platform also rules out higher taxes and expresses firm 
opposition to abortion 
bush and reagan staged a joint appearance before cabinet 
officers and senior appointees of the administration with bush 
appealing for their help in the fall campaign 
if we state in plain terms the case for low taxes and high 
opportunity for a strong america and a peaceful world i believe 
well have another republican victory in november he said 
bush said that the mcgovern or carter or mondale 
democratsare just itching to get back into the game 
given the chance i am convinced that they would repeal the 
tax cuts that weve worked so hard to enact and defend and that 
would defeat and simply bury this recovery he said 
measure us by our performance peace is breaking out all over 
the world earlier this week on the same day the headlines 
announced not one but two ceasefires in very troubled areas of 
the world one between iran and iraq and one between angola cuba 
and south africa 
reagan said he would crisscross the country this fall to help 
bush 
the other folks talk george bush will deliver the truth is 
that what weve achieved is just the beginning the best is yet to 
come he said 
dukakis campaigning in virginia stepped up his criticism of 
reagan administration spending policies and said interest rates 
will continue to rise if we continue to live on a credit card 
as we all know sooner or later the bill collector comes to 
the door the massachusetts governor said 
dukakis has been criticized in virginia because he opposes 
construction of two new navy supercarrier task forces which would 
be built at the newport news va shipyard gov gerald l baliles 
said he parted company with the presidential candidate on that 
point but added i have no doubts no reservations and no 
hesitations about dukakis on his commitment to national security 
dukakis aides also said the campaign was airing the first 
television commercials of the general election campaign in texas 
and california in the three days leading up to the republican 
national convention 
by working together to create opportunity and a good life for 
all all of us are enriched not just in economic terms but as 
citizens and as human beings dukakis says in the ad 
dukakis running mate lloyd bentsen appealed to hispanic voters 
for support as he began a weeklong stint of doubleduty 
campaigning in texas bentsen is seeking reelection to his senate

democratic vice presidential nominee 
lloyd bentsen returned to his home state friday to ask hispanic 
voters for support as he began a week of texas campaigning that 
will keep him visible while the republican national convention 
dominates the national political scene 
texas is a real battleground thats obvious bentsen said 
as he arrived in san antonio several hours late because of a delay 
leaving washington 
in remarks prepared for delivery friday night before the 
southwest voter registration project the texas senator said 
given the importance of the hispanic community in this election 
it is safe to assume that for the next three months you will be 
courted by both major parties you will get a lot of attention and 
hear a lot of promises 
mike dukakis lloyd bentsen and a united committed democratic 
party will stand shoulder to shoulder with you bentsen said an 
advance copy of his speech was released friday in washington 
bentsen told the group which works to increase hispanic 
political participation that its efforts already were being felt 
with a big increase in hispanic elected officials 
the large number of hispanic voters in texas and california 
which together have 76 electoral votes almost 30 percent of the 
total needed to win could tip the balance of power and elect our 
next president he said 
bentsen asked the group in both english and spanish to support 
the democratic ticket this year 
the stop in san antonio was the first in a week of texas 
appearances designed to shore up the traditional democratic 
support in the state and turn them into believers in the 
dukakisbentsen ticket said mike mccurry the campaigns 
spokesman 
dukakis planned to join his running mate at the end of the week 
i think the trip underscores the high degree of importance 
the ticket places on texas he said 
republican george bush is a new england native who also claims 
to be a texan but the bentsen campaign will try to emphasize the 
senators deeper roots in the state bentsen was born in the rio 
grande valley 
he is clearly doing something george bush cannot do 
campaigning as the states favorite son mccurry said 
by staying on the campaign trail bentsen also will be 
constantly ready to respond to developments in new orleans the 
site of the republican convention 
we know the democratic ticket will be in for some sharp 
attacks this week they might even say some things about lloyd 
bentsen mccurry said we want to go back to our base and shore 
it up while we are under attack 
after san antonio bentsen planned to visit kingsville laredo 
brownsville and houston this weekend a quick trip to arkansas was 
scheduled for monday and then it was back to texas 
dukakis plans to join bentsen late in the week for a visit to 
the lbj ranch and other events bentsen then will travel to florida

his study done in san francisco found users cut back on 
sharing of hypodermic needles which can spread the aids virus and 
cleaned their needles more as well as increasing their use of

hunters flocked to the heathercovered moors of 
scotland and northern england on friday the glorious twelfth of 
august and the start of the grousehunting season popular with 
landed gentry and wealthy tourists 
but the hunters gunfire was muted by declining stocks of the 
wild red grouse due to a parasite and vigorous protesters who 
drove the birds away with a predawn swoop on three grouse moors 
the hunt saboteurs association which opposes blood sports said 
about 300 members beat the hunters to the bushes and rousted the 
grouse at stanhope and gunnerside moors in northern england and in 
an area near muirshell country park in scotland

when it is harvest time in west 
germany some american soldiers switch from jeeps and tanks to 
harvesters and threshers 
this summer about 80 soldiers stationed in southern germany are 
helping local farmers bring in their crops 
young soldiers like pfc david connelly 20 of annandale 
minn are participating in a us army program to work a week or 
two on nearby farms 
like his colleagues connelly volunteered for the work which is 
counted as a temporary duty assignment and not furlough time but 
to the gis its like a vacation 
to me working on the land is fun connelly said apart 
from that i can sleep longer here than i can at the barracks 
suzanne schmidt a us army public affairs spokeswoman in 
heilbronn said the program started about 10 to 15 years ago with 
the intent to build better relations between the us military and 
local people 
it has been a really successful program with interest growing 
both on the part of the local farmers and among the young 
recruits schmidt said in a telephone interview 
each year the program which runs from the beginning of august 
to the end of october draws an increasing number of young 
enlistees many of whom come from big cities in the united states 
and have never had a farm experience 
us military officials see the project as a way of improving 
relations between the 250000 us military personnel in west 
germany and the local population 
these relations can be strained at times most recently many 
west germans have been complaining about lowlevel training flights 
by us military jets 
the stationing of us intermediaterange nuclear missiles as 
part of natos defense force in west germany set off frequent 
sometimes violent demonstrations outside us military bases in the 
early 1980s these tensions have diminished however with the 
signing in december of the ussoviet treaty that will remove the 
missiles 
the us army 7th corps in heilbronn works with local farmers 
associations to publicize the harvesting program and to find places 
among the local family farms for the soldiers 
schmidt said the soldiers are not required to have previous farm 
experience so long as they are motivated and eager to try 
for the german farmers the additional hands come inexpensively 
they need only provide room and board the us military pays the 
rest 
to farmers like ludwig waldburg who is connellys german host 
the extra help is welcome 
my family and i live and work the entire year just for and 
from the harvest since our farm does not carry livestock we earn 
our income only from the grain harvest waldburg said 
as they steer cropping and threshing machines through the dusty 
wheat and corn fields the american soldiers need little knowledge 
of the german language to harvest the grains 
connelly however had no language difficulties since his host 
family speaks english 
he is also accustomed to farmwork having helped out on his 
uncles 6000acre farm in minnesota 
waldburg praised connellys efforts 
he is not only ambitious he also understands something of his 
work 
both spokeswoman schmidt and farmer waldburg agree that the 
programs success has helped foster good relations between military 
and community 
many times the host family and the soldier will call up and 
ask for an extension schmidt said 
a bond is formed and often the soldier will go back to visit 
the family at christmas and easter 
waldburg who was himself an exchange student in the united 
states in his youth also is positive about the program 
i have only had the best experiences with the american 
soldiers in the past years he said 
it is with programs like this that real friendship is built

its been nearly 80 years since the house of lords 
stuck one foot in the grave and its enemies began looking ahead to 
a full burial 
yet this curious collection of princes bishops dukes 
marquises earls viscounts and barons seems to be staging a 
miraculous deathbed recovery 
not only has the upper house beaten its elected partner the 
house of commons in the race to be televised it also is handing 
legislative defeats to prime minister margaret thatcher at more 
than double the rate sustained by any conservative government since 
world war ii 
those who despair of thwarting mrs thatchers radical 
capitalist reforms in the commons look increasingly to the lords 
where most seats pass from father to son the peers who are not 
elected and serve for life can vote against the government with no 
fear of party discipline 
the lords topheavy with conservative landowners ought to be 
the natural ally of mrs thatchers conservatives yet it is the 
opposition labor party sworn enemy of inherited privilege that is 
benefitting most from the lords independence of mind 
mrs thatchers 101seat majority in the 650member commons 
guarantees that bills pass in the lower chamber but in the lords 
she has suffered 127 defeats since coming to office in 1979 
in recent years the peers have opposed the abolition of londons 
leftwing local government rescued free eye and dental checkups 
restored free school transport in rural areas stopped corporal 
punishment in state schools toned down a bill to abolish 
university tenure curbed the expansion of police stopandsearch 
powers 
the commons still has the last word and some measures 
including abolition of the london authority ultimately become law 
despite the lords resistance but almost always with compromise 
amendments 
by and large the two houses have learned to live with each 
other and the broad effect is that a lot of amendments made by the 
house of lords get accepted by the house of commons says lord 
belstead the lords conservative leader 
lordswatchers now are divided into two camps those who say a 
house based on inherited privilege is bad and those who say its 
bad but 
hugo young a columnist in the leftleaning guardian newspaper 
says the house of lords relieves pressure for britain to have an 
elected upper chamber like the us senate 
it is proof that of all the democracies britain is the most 
backward argues young 
lord ponsonby the labor partys chief whip calls the 
hereditary principle an intolerable affront to democracy 
but ponsonby himself a peer by inheritance values the lords as 
a revising chamber where commons legislation is finetuned and he 
acknowledges that the lords today is the best ally of the labor 
party in the legislative process 
although the house of lords lost the right to make tax laws in 
the 17th century only in 1910 was it stripped of all power over 
money bills and limited to two years the time period in which it 
could delay a bill 
the emasculation followed the lords veto of david lloyd 
georges liberal budget for the people and most assumed that 
the lords having thrown their reactionary weight about once too 
often would soon be scrapped altogether their power to delay a 
bill was cut to one year in 1949 
the creation of new peers remains a potent tool of government 
patronage 
belstead maintains the lords has opened up to new walks of life 
actors small businessmen trade unionists and women 
but of the 1191 peers 759 are there by inheritance only 10 of 
them laborites all but four are white all but 66 are men and 446 
are conservatives to labors 117 and the centrist parties 87 the 
remainder are independents or declare no political affiliation 
only about 300 peers attend debates regularly and in may the 
government had to summon nonattenders to ensure passage of a 
controversial property tax bill the turnout of 509 was the second 
biggest this century 
the key to mrs thatchers defeats have been regular attenders 
among the 266 independents the crossbenchers 
belstead 55 a lanky former schoolteacher who inherited his 
fathers title in 1958 has no ready answer to why the house 
survives 
in an interview he focused on the lords function as a revising 
chamber noting that peers work long hours and draw only 52pounds 
88 for each session attended plus expenses 
the chamber also provides the law lords nine ennobled judges 
who sit as the countrys highest court 
although they treasure their archaic rituals the lords boast of 
an openness to change they brought in electric lights before the 
commons and have allowed their debates to be televised since 1984 
something the commons only now is planning 
all in all its a relaxed place its still quite acceptable to 
fall asleep in midspeech the giveaway is often the ear trumpet 
sliding out of the hand or to ramble on at length about 
grouseshooting leaky army boots and what to do if mrs thatcher 
is at the hairdressers during a nuclear alert 
and then theres the joy of dressing up in ermine gowns and 
twopeaked hats to welcome a new member 
for one day of the year i was even prettier than my wife 
remarked len murray when he went from being general secretary of 
the national labor federation the trades union congress to being 
lord murray of epping forest

when the three major networks held their 
annual showandtell for television critics here the question of 
the hour was what the writers strike would do to the new fall 
shows 
the strike ended midway through the critics convention and the 
networks are reassembling the 198889 television season 
underlying the immediate effects of the strike however was the 
longerterm and for the networks more worrisome issue of audience 
erosion 
the strikes effects can only steepen the seemingly inexorable 
slide in ratings and audience share for the networks fewer people 
are watching the networks because they have more choices cable 
syndication and vcrs 
two weeks ago the threenetwork share hit its lowest level and 
cable sees itself becoming a major player in the scramble to catch 
the eye of the roving viewer 
you ask me whats going to happen in the next 10 years you 
wont hear the word cable anymore itll be television said 
michael fuchs chairman and chief executive officer of home box 
office theyre not going to be able to distinguish between what 
was cable and what was the big three 
im not trying to climb up the back of the networks i think 
theres room for all of us fuchs said but we just dont feel 
minor league anymore compared to the networks 
the network executives who spoke to the tv critics while not 
exactly putting on happy faces at least put up a brave front 
david poltrack cbs vice president for marketing used numbers to 
argue that the networks are doing quite well considering 
we constantly hear that we are losing our audiences to the new 
alternatives and that somehow we are at fault said poltrack 
the fact is that in 1980 the average american household had five 
viewing options the three local network affiliates were three of 
these five options in other words the network affiliates 
represented 60 percent of the viewing options the networks 
commanded 86 percent of the viewing audience 
today poltrack went on the average american household 
has 20 viewing options three local network affiliates are still 
only three of the now 20 options in other words the network 
affiliates represent only 15 percent of the average households 
viewing options yet the networks still command 68 percent of share 
of primetime viewing on a fullyear basis 
i for one do not think we at the networks have to make 
excuses for that performance 
robert c wright president of nbc concedes the networks are 
losing audience but says cable has had it easy so far because its 
programming some of it old network material has been relatively 
inexpensive 
as soon as they cable channels try to step up to a major 
increase in viewership theyre going to have enormous cost 
pressures of their own i think theyre going to have a very very 
tough time wright said 
abc entertainment president brandon stoddard said he was 
confident that quality network programming would hold audiences 
if you have a successful program or a bunch of successful 
programs youre going to do fine said stoddard nbc has more 
successful programs than we do and theyre doing fine i 
actually think the network programs are getting better and as they 
get better theyre going to maintain share 
stoddards counterpart at nbc brandon tartikoff sees a cloud 
on our horizon at his own network future absence of the cosby 
show bill cosby has said he would not continue the no 1rated 
series beyond this season cheers another topfive show for 
nbc is also likely to leave the air in the next couple years 
i think we made the best segue in the history of broadcasting 
when hill street blues was in its last season along came la 
law said tartikoff 
so our hope is that we will have bill cosby next year our 
hope is that the cheers people will want to go one more and that 
the audience will want them to go one more 
but the intent tartikoff said is to be in a flurry of 
development as soon as our doors open up tomorrow in the 
development of key 8 oclock comedies and 8 and 9 oclock dramas 
because i think that is the necessary formula for nbc to keep this 
dynasty going

like others at the 1980 republican 
national convention orchestra leader manny harmon was nervously 
awaiting announcement of ronald reagans choice for vice 
presidential running mate 
rumors persisted that former president gerald r ford would get 
the nod 
for journalists that meant getting copy ready on the former 
michigan congressman for political power brokers and analysts it 
meant consideration of the impact of a reaganford ticket 
for harmon who once again this week serves as musical director 
at the republican convention in new orleans it meant making sure 
his musicians had sheet music ready for the michigan fight song 
and youve got to be a football hero 
all of a sudden bush came out of the woodwork and everyone got 
caught short harmon recalled i couldnt think of where bush 
was from i knew it was a couple of places maine and texas 
then someone remembered that bush went to yale harmon said 
ah an ivy leaguer sheet music out ladies and gentlemen for 
boola boola 
once again harmon now 78 saved the musical day we just got 
lucky on that one he said 
harmon is playing the vice presidential blues this year on the 
downbeat of certain republican presidential nominee george bush 
harmon in a recent telephone interview from his office said he 
has identified at least 12 possible candidates from news accounts 
and everyone has to have a song 
harmon may have only minutes from learning the name to playing 
an introductory tune for the nominee he has a 700song library to 
choose from 
we try to figure out beforehand where the candidates are 
from said harmon i know some of the different candidates from 
playing for them at various functions and i know certain tunes 
they like and there are a lot of tunes that still have fire to 
them but arent regional he said 
thats important because sometimes the official state tune 
isnt necessarily the one that a crowd recognizes or likes 
for the record noted harmon the official state song of 
california is i love you california not california here i 
come and for new york its the great big state of new york 
not east side west side 
and folks are sensitive about that type of thing harmon has 
learned i once got called out on the carpet for playing east 
side west side for new york he said 
his compromise in such cases is a twosong medley with the less 
popular but official tune giving way to the more wellknown number 
harmon also has noted over the years a shift in the role of the 
orchestra at the convention the orchestra once was used as a 
device to bring unruly crowds under control with the irresistible 
beat of a patriotic tune 
modern conventions slickly produced and geared for television 
have fewer and fewer items settled by floor fights they depend 
more upon great sound spectacles and splitsecond timing he said 
whats lost is the drama 
once in 1968 in kansas city there was a floor fight said 
harmon who could not recall what the fight was over then it 
turned into a real demonstration and things started to get out of 
hand california senator george murphy said play something 
patriotic 
we played god bless america and everybody had to stand 
up harmon said but we had to play it three times before 
everybody calmed down 
harmon is a philadelphia native who has spent more than 50 years 
in the music business including 17 with rko studios where he 
scored and directed music for feature films he also befriended 
murphy then a songanddance man for the studio 
as the leader of the cocoanut grove orchestra in los angeles 
harmon became a favorite of hollywood stars and worked on several 
films he also became one of the movie colonys most soughtafter 
orchestra leaders for benefits and galas 
harmons first gig as gop bandmaster was in 1956 when dwight 
eisenhower carried the partys banner for a second term along with 
vice president richard nixon a 50piece orchestra played at that 
cow palace convention in san francisco 
harmon will bring 12 musicians to new orleans and pick 10 more 
union musicans from that citys ample roster everybodys on a 
budget now he said with a laugh 
harmon who has also directed orchestras at several democratic 
party functions has declined over the years to reveal his 
political affiliation he has played music at various functions for 
every american president since franklin roosevelt 
nixon liked foxtrots he recalled he and mrs nixon used to 
throw a lot of parties said harmon they were always formal

for new york state the execution of eddie 
lee mays in sing sings electric chair on aug 15 1963 was the 
695th and last time it used the device of death it introduced to 
the world in 1890 
yet in the quarter century since debate about the death penalty 
and its usefulness or offensiveness has no more faded than the 
states murder rate now well above the national average 
is life more precious in places where governments refuse to 
execute murderers are the streets safer are governors right to 
veto capital punishment legislation ignoring what polls indicate 
is overwhelming support for the death penalty in new york 
in 25 years the rituals still carried on elsewhere concerning 
the electric chair the last meal the prison chaplain soothing the 
condemned have been supplanted in new york with new rituals of 
emotional debate in the legislature and among citizens 
as frustrations mount on all sides of the issue so do the 
murder statistics new yorks criminals have not left the business 
of killing even while the state has 
the states murder rate is nearly three times higher now than on 
the day the 34yearold mays paid with his life for killing a woman 
in a harlem bar robbery below the national average in 1963 the 
states murder rate in 1987 stood at 113 per 100000 people 
compared to 83 murders per 100000 nationally 
those who favored abolishing the death penalty said society 
would be more civil and wed have about the same number of killings 
but less crime generally said republican dale volker a former 
police officer from suburban buffalo and the state senates 
strongest capital punishment advocate 
eventually they said wed have a more moralistic system 
well clearly the total and complete reversal has happened weve 
never had such viciousness as we have today you have a situation 
today where our streets are more of a war zone than at any time in 
history 
the chief question in any debate about the death penalty is 
whether it makes criminals think twice before committing capital 
offenses it is also the question no one can answer with enough 
certainty to settle the issue 
gov mario cuomo a democrat who has vetoed death penalty bills 
in each of his six years in office says the sentence has become a 
sort of cureall for many of societys terrible terrible 
problems 
just keep saying death penalty he said of some advocates 
get them mesmerized with language hypnotize everybody just keep 
looking at the electric chair 
cuomo says there is no proof the threat of that chair deters 
wouldbe murderers he suspects it could make some criminals more 
vicious he also argues that too many people were wrongly convicted 
of capital crimes to feel confident in sending prisoners to their 
deaths 
that uncertainty prompted the legislature and former gov nelson 
rockefeller to abandon the death penalty in 1965 except in cases 
involving the murder of peace officers and prison guards 
later decisions by the us supreme court and the states 
highest court the court of appeals effectively wiped capital 
punishment statutes off the state books and they was not restored 
after the 1976 supreme court ruling that allowed states to resume 
putting murderers to death 
the way to lower the states murder and crime rates is to 
provide better education and health programs including efforts 
against drug and alcohol abuse especially for poor young people 
cuomo says to control criminals he adds law agencies must be 
wellfunded and enough prison cells must exist to accommodate all 
offenders 
cost you a fortune the governor conceded 
the cuomo administrations criminal justice services 
coordinator john poklemba said the death penalty would not 
affect the vast majority of violent crimes that we need to do 
something about 
the emergence of crack and the increase in the amount of drugs 
that are now on the street the enormous amount of cocaine that is 
on the streets is overwhelming the whole criminal justice 
system poklemba said 
the topic of crackdealing desperadoes is a good example of how 
vexing the debate can be volker and other death penalty supporters 
say reestablishing the punishment is just the message society must 
send but poklemba said the prospect of the electric chair means 
little to such criminals 
they have uzi machine guns he said theyre fighting it 
out among themselves for drugselling territory they certainly 
dont care about a death penalty the threat of being found guilty 
and being executed 10 to 15 years down the road is not going to be 
a deterrent if taking a chance of getting blown away that day 
doesnt deter him 
aides to volker say that under a bill thats repeatedly been 
before the legislature the perpetrators of about one quarter of 
new york states 2000 murders a year could be charged with capital 
murder and sentenced to the electric chair 
but the measure wont become law this year while the senate 
voted to override cuomos veto the assembly last month fell seven 
votes short of the 100 needed 
while most new yorkers seem to have an opinion about the death 
penalty they apparently dont feel strongly enough to make it the 
determining factor in who holds the states highest office cuomo 
and gov hugh carey before him both won election against 
procapital punishment foes 
cuomo and carey are important for the proposition that 
political leaders who make it quite clear that they will not have 
the death penalty because they dont propose to be responsible for 
official homicides can still get elected said henry schwarzchild 
of the american civil liberties union which opposes the death 
penalty while the public disagrees it will also respect that 
cuomo is sure to be standing in the way again in 1989 and for as 
long as hes governor but volker says death penalty supporters 
will keep up their end of the ritual too 
i am convinced we will eventually override he said

in a cramped gondola dangling beneath 
an 11story helium balloon with clouds obstructing any view below 
the disembodied voice of the radar operator seemed scarcely to be 
believed 
you have crossed the coast of ireland the voice told three 
american balloonists on that stilldark early morning 10 years ago 
larry newman asked if the message was indeed that which had eluded 
others for 105 years 
silence 
then crisply sir my radar is never wrong 
newman along with ben abruzzo and maxie anderson whooped with 
joy sunburned and weary after five days aloft the 
businessmenadventurers had made the first transatlantic crossing 
in a balloon 
the three landed their blackandsilver double eagle ii later 
that day aug 17 1978 in a wheat field west of paris 
today newman is the only one of the three still alive 
anderson was killed in 1983 at age 48 when his balloon crashed 
in a west german forest during a race abruzzo then 53 died in 
1985 when his twinengine airplane crashed shortly after takeoff in 
albuquerque 
newman now 40 and a commercial airline pilot in phoenix ariz 
said he has no specific plans to celebrate wednesdays anniversary 
but he said his thoughts often drifted back to that summer 10 
years ago 
newman recalled that after the initial jubilation anderson went 
to sleep while he and abruzzo looked down through the clearing 
clouds on the lights of dublin ireland 
the silent 112foot balloon 15000 feet up caught sounds that 
drifted skyward newman and abruzzo could hear dogs barking and 
trains rumbling along tracks nearly 3 miles below 
tears came to my eyes newman said i put my arm around 
ben hed always been somewhat like a father to me i hadnt felt 
that close to another human being for as long as i can remember 
the men began the flight six days earlier when the double eagle 
ii lifted up from presque isle maine and headed toward europe 
more than 3000 miles away 
newman says the flight was not without problems including a 
clash of personalities 
maxie anderson later stated that he wished he could have flown 
the flight by himself newman said i dont know what bens 
feelings were but i wanted someone to share this with i didnt 
want to be charles lindbergh 
newman said conflicts arose when anderson and abruzzo both began 
making key decisions 
any aircraft can only have one captain and we had two ben 
abruzzo and maxie anderson he said 
but newman said conflicts were overshadowed by the hardships of 
the flight in the 12by6foot living space crowded with tv cameras 
and navigational equipment newmans hang glider dangled beneath 
the gondola and 5500 pounds of sand and lead for ballast hung over 
the sides in bags 
there were many times the flight was in question newman 
recalled but how close it came to failure at each moment was 
interpreted different by each of us 
they lost altitude rapidly at one point when ice chunks crusted 
the top of the balloon they jettisoned valuable ballast when they 
dropped to 4000 feet the ice melted 
later in the flight they dumped more ballast including an 
expensive navigation system that had failed on the second day they 
tossed oxygen bottles anything they could 
newman said that at one point a bit delirious from the 
altitude he chucked a 4000 radio and only later noticed a jar 
of peanut butter that weighed as much 
plans were for newman to fly the glider down once they made it 
to paris 
but 400 miles from ireland it came down to a choice of dropping 
the glider their last oxygen and food or a propane tank for a 
heater to battle abruzzos frostbite the glider went 
radios also failed during the flight and the men had to 
communicate by ham radio 
the first guy i talked to wouldnt talk because i didnt have 
a license said newman and he didnt believe i was in a 
balloon over the middle of the ocean 
finally newman reached an old man confined to a wheelchair in a 
home for the elderly somewhere in england 
his call sign was g4jy i dont think ill ever forget 
that he said he talked to me until the last day of the 
flight he was like the good shepherd 
newman said the rough times were offset by the excitement 
a high point he said came over ireland when a jumbo jet 
relayed a message from the smithsonian institution the museum had 
asked to display the gondola and balloon in the national air and 
space museum that houses the apollo 11 moonship lindberghs spirit 
of st louis and the wright brothers plane 
in the final few hours the men believed they would make it to 
paris where lindbergh had landed 51 years before after the first 
solo transatlantic airplane flight but over evreux france they 
realized they could not go on 
the last of the ballast was gone save for a bottle of 
champagne they were 60 miles west of paris 3107 miles and 137 
hours from maine where the heliumpacked balloon had taken off 
the swiftly draining balloon envelope carcass and its gondola 
settled gently to earth as cheering spectators abandoned their cars 
along a nearby highway and rushed to the balloon 
hundreds tried to take a piece of history 
its hard to chew rubberized cloth newman said people 
were trying to tear little shreds off but i think they were 
probably losing their teeth more than damaging the balloon 
the french press dubbed them the new lindberghs 
but newman says the only time he thought about lindbergh was 
when the adventurers drew straws that evening to see which would 
sleep in lindberghs bed at the american ambassadors residence in 
france 
newman and his wife won 
and i ended up on the floor after 30 minutes because i 
couldnt sleep he said the bed was like a banana the springs 
were shot

businesses and consumers with bank loans priced 
according to swings in the prime interest rate will feel the most 
immediate impact from major banks decisions to boost the rate for 
the third time this year 
the banks raised their base lending rates by a halfpercentage 
point to 10 percent on thursday a more than 3year high in 
reaction to the federal reserves drive to push all interest rates 
higher to curb inflation 
the prime rate increase the second in a month puts the key 
lending rate in doubledigit territory for the first time since 
june 1985 
because the prime is used to calculate a wide range of fixedand 
adjustablerate loans the change will affect consumers who already 
have seen borrowing costs rise in recent months 
a higher prime rate will affect small to mediumsized 
businesses and consumers more so than large corporations which 
borrow more cheaply in the open market by issuing commercial paper 
or shortterm unsecured ious 
home equity lines of credit usually are pegged to the prime 
rate while many adjustablerate home mortgages are tied to 
interest paid on treasury bills 
elizabeth g reiners an economist at dean witter reynolds inc 
said higher borrowing costs may have a significant effect on the 
spending habits of consumers who have been buying on credit in 
increasing numbers lately 
if you have to pay more for loans then you have less money 
to buy things like furniture clothing and other little 
niceties she said 
it will slow the economy but it wont stop it in its 
tracks said robert a brusca chief financial economist for the 
investment firm nikko securities co international thats a 
healthy thing right now 
you try to get your flu shot before you get the flu thats 
preventative medicine thats what the fed is doing brusca said 
financial markets took thursdays news in stride after 
weathering the storm that followed the feds increase in a key 
lending rate earlier in the week 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed 
up 516 to 203930 bond prices which generally decline in the 
face of rising interest rates ended mixed 
the dollar lost ground against all key foreign currencies 
although some european traders credited the prime rate hike for 
preventing a free fall 
chase manhattan bank was the first to announce the prime hike 
thursday morning with other major banks across the country quickly 
following suit 
the increase brings the prime to its highest level since june 
18 1985 when it was lowered to 95 percent from 10 percent 
the prime was at 85 percent at the beginning of the year the 
banks raised it to 9 percent on may 11 and then to 95 percent on 
july 14 
economists widely had anticipated the latest boost the fed 
signaled its desire to tighten credit on tuesday by raising its 
discount rate to 65 percent from 6 percent citing inflationary 
pressures the discount rate is the interest the fed charges on 
loans to member banks 
economists said the subsequent boost in the prime reflected the 
rising of borrowing costs faced by the banks rates banks pay on 
products such as certificates of deposits or money market accounts 
have been forced up although not at the same pace as bank loans 
the trend toward higher interest rates reflects prevailing 
concerns in the credit markets that the economy might be 
overheating and inflation creeping up higher inflation erodes the 
value of fixedrate investments such as treasury bonds forcing 
borrowers to pay higher interest rates to attract investors 
many analysts predict interest rate will continue to head higher 
but discount a big increase

bally manufacturing corp which last month 
disclosed the sale of its pinballmachine and videogame 
businesses is taking an even bigger restructuring step by spinning 
off its hotelcasino group to its shareholders 
bally announced the planned restructuring late thursday and said 
it planned to maintain a 15 percent stake in the hotelcasino 
business which accounted for about half its 173 billion in sales 
last year 
the move is intended to boost ballys stock price by creating 
two separate companies and by permitting the separate management 
of each company to pursue specific business opportunities on an 
independent basis bally spokesman william peltier said in a 
statement 
ballys stock closed up 12 cents at 2275 thursday in 
composite new york stock exchange trading the restructuring was 
announced after the market closed 
ballys stockholders will receive as a taxfree dividend one 
share of common stock in the hotelcasino business for each share 
of bally manufacturing they own on the effective date of the 
spinoff 
the company the creator of pacman space invaders and other 
videogame hits announced last month it was selling its 
pinballvideo manufacturing business on which the company was 
founded for about 8 million to rival wms industries inc parent 
of williams electronics games 
bally will retain all of its other leisure and manufacturing 
businesses which consist of ballys health amp tennis corp a chain 
of 250 fitness centers the aladdins castle chain of more than 300 
video arcades the scientific games division which manufactures 
lottery equipment life fitness inc a maker of exercise 
equipment and a slotmachine manufacturing division 
the arrangement should allow the stock price of each 
publiclytraded company to more accurately reflect ballys 
underlying value the company said in a statement 
ballys health and fitness operations and the gaming equipment 
divisions accounted for roughly 43 percent of the companys revenue 
last year 
bally indicated it expected each of the separate companies to 
post more than 1 billion in revenue this year 
lee isgur an analyst with painewebber inc in new york said 
the company had been expected for some time to pursue some type of 
restructuring 
you could have the value of the two asset groups appreciate 
significantly from where they are today isgur said diverse 
groups of investors can focus on the group that most attracts 
them 
isgur said he began recommending ballys stock last spring when 
it was trading around 16 
wall street has regarded bally as ripe for a restructuring due 
to a relatively weak stock price stemming from an erratic 
performance in several ventures such as its video game business 
bally made big profits from the business during the video game 
craze of the late 1970s and early 1980s but earnings tumbled when 
the games popularity declined bally wrote off much of the video 
game business in 1984 after it lost more than 100 million 
bally fended off a takeover overture from real estate developer 
donald trump in 1987 paying a premium to buy trumps 99 percent 
stake in the company 
the hotelcasino company will operate two atlantic city casino 
hotels ballys park place and ballys grand and two casino hotels 
in nevada ballys las vegas and ballys reno 
consumation of the spinoff will require approval from new 
jersey and nevada authorities and the internal revenue service 
according to bally which also plans to seek stockholder approval

polaroid corps patent court victory over rival 
eastman kodak co was upheld by a federal judge who ruled that 
another judge in the case was unbiased despite a relatives kodak 
stock holdings 
us district judge a david mazzone on thursday rejected 
kodaks request to throw out a 1985 decision by another federal 
judge who found kodak had violated several polaroid patents on 
instant film and cameras 
kodak attorney richard e carlton immediately appealed the 
decision to the 1st us circuit court of appeals 
mazzones ruling came during the first hearing to set a schedule 
for the damages portion of the case polaroid has requested 57 
billion in damages for the patent infringements 
the damages trial tentatively is set to begin in january 
kodak had argued in the 12yearold patent case that all of 
federal judge rya zobels rulings in the case should be vacated 
because zobels motherinlaw owned 1000 shares of kodak stock 
worth about 100000 when the trial began in 1981 
zobel withdrew from the case in june shortly after her 
motherinlaw died and she was named as a beneficiary of the stock 
which had increased to 2150 shares because of stock splits 
under the circumstances i cannot find that it is the law that 
eastman kodak obtain a vacation of this case up to this point 
mazzone said i do not think that would be fair or be equitable 
to everyone 
mazzone said zobel made it clear at the outset of the trial in 
october 1981 that her motherinlaw owned the kodak stock he said 
neither kodak nor polaroid raised the issue during the initial 
trial after zobels ruling in 1985 or during a lengthy appeal 
process 
she said she did not think that was a disqualifying reason 
mazzone said i dont think that was incorrect eastman kodak did 
not disagree with it 
polaroid attorney herbert schwartz called the decision 
entirely proper and correct and obviously sound 
polaroid the cambridgebased camera company that pioneered 
instant photography sued kodak in 1976 after the rochester ny 
camera company introduced its own line of instant film and cameras 
zobel ruled in september 1985 that kodak had infringed on seven 
of about 150 polaroid patents and barred kodak from the business 
in january 1986 
on may 9 she told both sides that she intended to remove 
herself from the case because she and her husband were 
beneficiaries of her motherinlaws estate the judge acquiesced 
after both sides encouraged her to continue in the case and asked 
her for time to research the situation 
but in a motion filed june 15 kodak called for zobels 
immediate disqualification and dismissal of all her rulings in the 
case since october 1981 one week later she withdrew

a federal court has canceled a scheduled 
friday hearing on kansas city southern industries application for 
a stay of a recent court order barring its efforts to purchase the 
southern pacific railroad 
kcsi president and chief executive landon rowland said he asked 
the court to cancel the hearing on the advice of company attorneys 
who said it was procedurally not ripe to have the hearing now 
he said the cancellation had nothing to do with tuesdays 
interstate commerce commission approval of rio grande industries 
incs proposal to buy southern pacific 
the icc in a series of votes tuesday rejected the kansas city 
southern proposal partly due to concern over kansas city 
southerns financial outlook in light of a 600 million court 
judgment against the company 
in april a us district court jury in south dakota returned a 
verdict that kansas city southern had violated antitrust laws by 
helping block a coal slurry pipeline that would have taken some of 
the railroads business and awarded the judgment to the state of 
south dakota 
the verdict is being appealed to the 8th circuit court of 
appeals in st paul minn 
a federal judge in sioux falls sd recently ruled that kcsi 
could not buy southern pacific railroad while it is appealing the 
judgment 
we think its moot in view of the fact that the order has not 
been entered in south dakota rowland said of fridays court 
hearing 
southern pacific part of santa fe southern pacific corp has 
15000 miles of track and is one of the oldest rail lines in the 
nation with track stretching from oregon to louisiana 
sante fe southern reached agreement with rio grande industries 
on the sale last february but when permission for the transaction 
was sought from the icc kansas city southern objected and asked 
that it be allowed to buy the railroad 
roland said the companys offer to buy southern pacific is 
still on the table and said the company would review all its 
options when the full commission decision is released

a financial planner may have fled with as much as 
25 million in retirement funds belonging to a group of doctors and 
other investors each of whom received an apologetic note 
explaining i have run away 
henry gherman 51 a former selfmade millionaire whose career 
as an ace salesman collapsed in personal bankruptcy is believed to 
have fled the miami area and sources close to the case say he may 
have left the country 
about 50 of ghermans clients learned of his disappearance when 
they received copies of the handwritten note in the mail this week 
everybody is pretty much in a state of shock said leonard 
filhaber a 61yearold salesman who says he had total trust in 
gherman for 12 years were all sort of walking around bouncing 
off walls 
my wife and i have worked 17 bloody years morning noon and 
night and now were broke filhaber said thursday now i can 
understand why old people believe in mattresses 
in his note gherman said he was unable to face the 
humiliation disgrace and consequences that would follow once his 
company financial amp investment planning inc collapsed he added 
that he would try to return the doctors money 
i have been dealing with financial and emotional problems for 
the past many months and have been unable to come up with any 
solution other than running the note said by the time you 
receive this letter i will be gone i have run away 
gherman and his companies were being investigated for possible 
wire fraud bank fraud embezzlement and interstate transportation 
of stolen property fbi spokesman paul miller said 
gherman handled pension funds for a long list of clients that 
included at least 20 doctors many of whom are wondering whether 
theyll see their money again 
im very angry said dr jack lubin a miami beach 
pathologist but i dont want to talk about it i might say 
something i shouldnt 
a court statement filed wednesday by 12 clients who are suing 
gherman to recover the funds says the financial adviser fled town 
monday leaving behind his wife and two grown children gherman 
worked for some of the doctors for as long as 20 years even 
managing their offices 
a dade circuit judge on wednesday granted the clients request 
to appoint a receiver to oversee the finances of gherman his 
family and his companies 
the investors also filed a 25 million lawsuit accusing gherman 
of fraudulently shifting their money to his wife and two children 
according to their attorney jay solowsky 
ghermans wife said through an attorney that she had no prior 
knowledge of his intentions to leave 
solowsky said gherman accepted money from clients to invest in 
certificates of deposit but banks said they had no record of any 
cds being purchased gherman also accepted money to buy medical 
malpractice insurance for his physician clients but failed to pay 
any premiums solowsky said 
its difficult to determine how much is missing the lawyer 
said from polling various clients solowsky said he believes the 
figure is as high as 25 million 
gherman is neither a lawyer nor an accountant and his 
investment and management companies are not registered with the 
state as investment advisers solowsky said 
gherman son of a new york city waiter became a millionaire 
before he turned 30 through his financial acumen and salesmanship 
he sold 1 million worth of insurance in one year for the john 
hancock mutual life insurance co 
his financial troubles began in july 1969 gherman then 34 
filed for personal bankruptcy listing 1 million in unpaid bills 
for casinos hotels credit card purchases clothes and flowers

five top officers of an investment group pleaded 
innocent to racketeering charges alleging a scheme to sell bogus 
stock and securities and their lawyers criticized what they called 
a broad attack on wall street 
a sixth defendant a former trader for drexel burnham lambert 
inc did not attend the arraignment thursday at federal court in 
manhattan but his lawyer entered an innocent plea for him 
the six were named last week in a 35count indictment on charges 
of racketeering and conspiracy the first time racketeering charges 
have been leveled against individual securities traders 
in court thursday prosecutors disclosed that they plan to bring 
a new and broader indictment in the case within two months the 
indictment could add additional charges or new defendants 
the defendants from princetonnewport partners a limited 
partnership based in princeton nj and newport beach calif 
are james sutton regan 46 of pennington nj jack z 
rabinowitz 41 charles m zarzecki 40 and paul berkman 41 all 
of princeton nj and steven barry smotrich 33 of belle meade 
nj 
bruce lee newberg 31 of santa monica calif a former 
securities trader at the investment firm drexel burnham lambert 
inc entered an innocent plea through his lawyer 
defense lawyers criticized the governments plan saying it 
would preclude a speedy trial because the lawyers would need more 
time to prepare for any additional charges 
the lawyers issued a threepage statement which said in part 
that the racketeering charges were brought to coerce the 
testimony of the defendants against principals at drexel and the 
investment firm goldman sachs amp co firms the partners had dealt 
with 
two grand juries are investigating allegations of insider 
trading involving the firms or their principals 
the statement said the partnership is proud of its association 
with those firms has no evidence of any wrongdoing on their part 
and refuses to join in this broad attack on wall street 
giuliani responded that the defense statement has no merit 
he said federal prosecutors have used the racketeering statutes in 
other securities cases and that defense lawyers in other cases have 
always complained about it 
the indictment accuses the six of a multimilliondollar mail and 
wire fraud conspiracy to make false stock trades in order to create 
phony longterm capital gains and shortterm capital losses for 
princetonnewport 
the indictment charged there was also a scheme involving the 
bogus sale of securities between princetonnewport partners and 
drexel to create more than 13 million in phony tax losses and 
avoid regulatory disclosure requirements 
if convicted on all counts each of the defendants faces a 
maximum 20year sentence

audi of america inc says its disappointed that 
a judge rejected a proposed settlement to a classaction lawsuit 
alleging that some of its cars were defective and it may go to 
trial with the case 
cook county circuit judge thomas rakowski on thursday threw out 
the proposed settlement between the company and a group of car 
owners who alleged that their audi 5000 sedans suddenly accelerated 
without warning 
the settlement puts people in a position where they have to 
buy an audi to reap any benefit rakowski said clearly its a 
settlement that i couldnt live with 
rakowski vacated an earlier order by another judge who gave 
preliminary approval to the settlement 
the judge recommended that both sides try to negotiate another 
agreement and report any progress at a hearing aug 31 
we are not sure that we will be negotiating said audi 
spokesman joseph bennett we always have the option of defending 
the suit 
but he said that the automaker had not decided what option to 
pursue 
attorneys for both sides announced the proposed settlement in 
june under which audi would have offered rebates of 300 to 2000 
to 390000 current or former owners who bought another audi 
however the company would not acknowledge liability 
circuit judge harold siegan gave prelimary approval to the 
settlement but removed himself in july because of his friendship 
with an attorney in the case 
attorney stephen nassau who represents the washingtonbased 
audi victims network a group of audi owners who contend their cars 
had sudden acceleration problems subsequently submitted a motion 
to vacate siegans ruling he contended the judge had failed to 
give proper scrutiny to the matter before approving it 
i certainly have a lot of respect for judge rakowksi nassau 
said after the judges ruling thursday he was obviously very 
troubled by what went on so far he said 
the case stems from a 1987 classaction suit alleging the audi 
5000s were defective because they could accelerate without warning 
the settlement would have applied to owners of audi 5000s built 
between 1978 and 1986 
the center for auto safety a washingtonbased group formed by 
consumer activist ralph nader has contended that the audi 
acceleration problem was linked to at least 1650 accidents 
causing 402 injuries and five deaths

postdepression levels in 1986 and have increased since as the 
state continues to feel the effects of the dramatic drop in oil 
prices and its resulting effects on real estate and the overall 
economy 
texas led the nation in bank failures the past two years with 
26 declared insolvent in 1986 and the 50 closed in 1987 
regulators frequently cite liberal lending practices and huge 
loan losses as reasons for texas bank failures and also blame 
banking officials for poor management 
before the 1985 oil price freefall a risky loan could be made 
and a bank could expect repayment from collateral if the loan 
failed 
but with the depreciation of real estate because of the drop in 
energy prices many loans cannot be repayed requiring banks to set 
aside more revenue to make up for the unpaid loans 
thursdays announcement could further provoke first republicbank 
investors who have threatened legal action over the fdics move 
many of the 40 subsidiary banks were healthy but were declared 
insolvent by the government when first republicbank then the 
states largest bank holding company failed and was purchased 
last month by ncnb corp of charlotte nc under an 
fdicsponsored bailout

the agriculture departments chief economist 
said today that despite a massive loss in farm production 
because of the drought there is no danger of food shortages or 
runaway inflation at grocery stores this year 
we did come into this season with good stock levels 
assistant agriculture secretary ewen m wilson said on the nbctv 
today program so there is no prospect of any shortages this 
year and we dont think there will be big price increases because 
we came in with pretty good supplies 
the usda issued a report thursday saying the drought should add 
only 1 percentage point to consumer food prices 
we dont see any runaway price inflation at the retail 
level wilson said in the interview 
the relatively optimistic price report came despite drought 
damage that is expected to include a 37 percent drop in corn 
production and continued threats to the soybean crop 
these figures show a massive loss in production its almost 
unprecedented what were seeing this year we had a very very dry 
period in june he said were now moving into a critical phase 
for the soybeans and if we dont get rain in august well lose even 
more of the soybean crop 
the department now is forecasting a food price increase for this 
year of 3 percent to 5 percent before the heat and dry weather 
usda had expected a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent 
but the impact might be even bigger in 1989 when food costs 
could go up an additional 2 percent due to the drought wilson told 
reporters thursday 
thats on top of an additional estimated increase in food 
prices somewhere in the region of 4 percent wilson said so 
this would bring it up to a total of 6 percent 
according to a usda crop production report issued thursday the 
corn harvest this fall may be about 448 billion bushels down 37 
percent from last years harvest and the smallest output since 1983 
sharp reductions also were reported for soybeans wheat and a 
number of other crops cotton which thrived last month in the hot 
humid weather is expected to increase from last year 
the grim news from usda came only hours after president reagan 
signed a 39 billion disaster relief bill aimed at helping 
droughtstricken farmers 
this bill isnt as good as rain reagan said to the nations 
farmers but it will tide you over until normal weather and your 
own skills permit you to return to your accustomed role 
overall the departments agricultural statistics board put 
total us crop production at 88 percent of the 1977 average a 
scale used to compare output from year to year tha matched the low 
1983 reading when sharp cutbacks in government acreage programs 
along with drought reduced production sharply 
the corn crop is expected to average 785 bushels per harvested 
acre down from 1194 bushels per acre last year a record 
yeartoyear decline of 34 percent 
corn is the largest and most important crop grown by american 
farmers and as a feed ingredient is essential to the production 
of meat poultry and dairy products 
todays reports confirm that the drought has had a major 
impact on this years crops wilson told reporters but because 
of large preseason stocks total supplies are enough in most cases 
to assure an adequate food supply at home satisfy foreign 
customers and meet our foodaid commitments 
sen patrick j leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee said in a statement todays crop report confirms our 
fears about the impacts of this summers tragic drought 
fortunately it appears we will have enough stocks to make it 
through this marketing year 
the new usda crop estimates were based on field surveys as of 
aug 1 in may and june before drought had made its biggest 
impact usda projected the corn harvest based on trends and an 
assumption of normal weather at 73 billion bushels 
but those projections were revised downward a month ago to 52 
billion bushels assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder 
of the season 
the soybean harvest was estimated at 147 billion bushels down 
23 percent from 19 billion bushels produced last year prospects 
last spring called for about 188 billion bushels and the july 
projection was 165 billion bushels 
production of all wheat was indicated at 182 billion bushels 
down 13 percent from 21 billion produced in 1987 
winter wheat production was estimated at 155 billion bushels 
down 1 percent from last year but durum and the other spring 
varieties which are produced in the hardhit northern plains 
showed sharp declines 
durum was estimated at 546 million bushels down 41 percent 
from last years harvest and other spring wheat was shown at 212 
million bushels down 53 percent from 1987 
cotton production was estimated at 149 million bales up 1 
percent from last year the crop was projected at 137 billion 
bales in july 
production of some other springplanted crops also has suffered 
including oats 206 million bushels down 45 percent barley 288 
million bushels also down 45 percent and sorghum 561 million 
bushels down 24 percent 
earlier at the white house reagan praised democratic and 
republican congressional leaders for putting aside partisan 
differences to speed action on the disaster relief bill 
reagan said the legislation which also provides assistance to 
dairy cattlemen and ethanol producers represents the largest 
disaster relief measure in history 
the measure among other things provides aid for farmers 
suffering crop losses of more than 35 percent of their expected 
harvest because of the drought or other calamities the payments 
would be equal to 65 percent of the lost income farmers whose crop 
losses exceeded 75 percent of the expected yield would receive 
payments equal to 90 percent of lost income 
the agriculture department said farmers intending to apply for 
relief under the drought bill should organize all their records and 
other evidence of their crop losses the department said however 
that the agricultural stabilization and conservation service would 
not be ready to start accepting applications for several weeks 
once the preliminary rulemaking for the program is completed 
farmers will apply to their ascs county agent for both the disaster 
payments and livestock feed assistance farmers seeking government 
loans also available under the program should contact their local 
farmers home administration offices usda said

a shadow economy that supplies everything the 
official system cant from bathroom repairs to medicine earns up 
to 145 billion a year and has made thousands of millionaires a 
report said today 
economist ti koryagin told the labor newspaper trud the 
underground economy will continue to grow until rubles earned by 
average people become more than paper that gives you the right to 
stand in line and be humiliated 
many soviets gladly pay more on the side for scarce goods or to 
have a repairman do better faster work they also give doctors a 
gift or cash to be more attentive extra money in turn gives 
those who earn it a chance to buy goods and services above 
stateset prices 
mikhail s gorbachevs moves to legalize cooperatives and some 
individual labor have brought some people out of the shadows and 
into the official economy where they pay taxes but many more 
remain outside corrupting the official system the article said 
services provided on the side or na levo in russian 
account for about 22 billion to 24 billion a year or about 
onequarter of the entire amount soviets pay annually it said 
the article said that 15 or 20 years ago the value of 
underground services was about 48 billion to 8 billion today 
together with the underground trade in food and other goods it 
ranges from 110 billion to 145 billion 
by comparison the entire soviet state budget for this fiscal 
year is about 760 billion 
the main items are overpaying workers for better housing and car 
repair tailoring and better attention at weddings and funerals 
it said 
the shadow economy is well known but figures are rarely given 
for its size under gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness 
on selected topics the soviet media have been more critical of 
social problems 
ms koryagin disagreed with some soviets who see the underground 
economy as merely instituting one of the main aims of gorbachevs 
reforms paying more to people who work better 
underground businessmen pull into their affairs the 
bureaucracy and the apparatus which increases the growth of 
corruption in order to live in the existing system its necessary 
to bribe people who dont do anything themselves but who have the 
final yes or no she was quoted as saying 
the soviet union has a few hundred legal millionaires mostly 
writers and artists but probably thousands more in the shadow 
economy the article said 
there are among them people who dont have a ruble in cash 
their money is constantly turning over in order to bring them an 
income she reported 
the underground economy will continue to exist until the 
official economy can provide the goods and services people want 
the article said 
that means the economy must in the future be managed by the laws 
of the market rather than bureaucrats it said 
that means we need directives that would return land to 
farmers and factories to the workers to make the people the 
allpowerful masters of the country ms koryagin concluded

inflation at the wholesale level rose to an annual rate of 57 
percent in july reflecting big boosts in a wide variety of 
products including clothng automobiles furniture and poultry 
the government said today 
the labor department reported that wholesale prices rose 05 
percent last month the biggest gain since march price increases 
were widespread across a wide variety of nonfood items such as 
drugs which were up 11 percent and cosmetics up 17 percent 
in june the departments producer price index for finised goods 
rose 04 percent or at an annual rate of 46 percent more than 
double the 22 percent rate of wholesale price inflation for all of 
1987 
todays report comes just three days after the federal reserve 
initiated an increase in interest rates to fight inflation 
on thursday major us banks reacted quickly to the feds move 
by boosting the prime lending rate a half percentage point to 10 
percent the highest level since the spring of 1985 
the prime rate hike though didnt upset the financial markets 
because it was a widely expected response to the feds earlier 
action in which the central bank raised the discount rate half a 
percentage point to 65 percent 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 
516 thursday to 203930 the average had had fallen nearly 100 
points over the five previous sessions partly because of 
interestrate jitters 
the dollar lost ground against all key foreign currencies 
indicating that the boost in the prime rate was not seen as a 
powerful lure for foreign money 
the dollars weakness in turn hurt bond prices which finished 
mostly unchanged or lower 
because the prime is used to calculate a wide range of fixedand 
adjustablerate loans the increase is likely to pinch the 
pocketbooks of consumers who already have seen borrowing costs rise 
in recent months 
it will slow the economy but it wont stop it in its 
tracks explained robert a brusca chief financial economist for 
the investment firm nikko securities co international thats a 
healthy thing right now 
you try to get your flu shot before you get the flu thats 
preventative medicine thats what the fed is doing 
the increase brings the closely watched rate to its highest 
level since june 18 1985 when it was lowered to 95 percent from 
10 percent 
at the start of the year the prime stood at 85 percent it was 
raised to 9 percent on may 11 and then another half percentage 
point on july 14 
the trend toward higher interest rates reflects prevailing 
concerns in the credit markets that the economy might be 
overheating and inflation creeping up 
in indicator of economic activity the commerce department 
reported that retail sales climbed 05 percent in july but 
economists warned that rising interest rates threaten to dampen 
even this modest growth rate in the months ahead

two stockholders of resorts 
international inc will have to go to civil court to try to block 
donald trump from getting more than 60 million from his deal to 
sell the company following the rejection of their claims by the 
casino control commission 
the panel said thursday that the stockholders should take their 
objections to a civil court julien j studley inc and joseph 
gutstein had argued that trump is not entitled to any payment for 
severing his services agreement 
in may trump reached an agreement to sell his interest in 
resorts to entertainer merv griffin in a deal which will take the 
company private and give trump the unfinished taj mahal casino 
hotel 
griffin has agreed to buy trumps controlling class b stock in 
the company for 962 million and to pay trump approximately 63 
million to sever a services agreement the services agreement was 
based on revenues pretax income and the construction cost of the 
taj mahal 
in return trump agreed to buy the taj mahal for approximately 
255 million 
the stockholders argued that trump is not entitled to any 
payment for severing his services agreement with resorts and the 
agreement is void 
alan bandler a lawyer for the stockholders has said trump 
bought control of the company a year ago and is now making a 63 
million profit from the termination of the management agreement as 
well as getting the taj mahal at a lucrative price 
in the interim bandler has charged the stockholders have lost 
135 million and he cited the decline in market value of resorts 
class a stock 
the commission also ruled it would not consider the financing of 
the trumpgriffin deal until griffin receives interim casino 
authorization for which he has applied 
under new jersey law interim casino authorization allows an 
unlicensed company or individual to hold an interest in or control 
of a casino company without first going through the extensive 
licensing process

the association of european airlines 
said delays in scheduled european flights in june were at least 
three times as many as in june 1986 
aea secretarygeneral karlheinz neumeister said friday that 
while delays in scheduled flights are not yet as bad as for charter 
flights the situation is definitely getting worse 
in january 115 percent of scheduled flights in europe were 
more than 15 minutes late and by late june this had reached 22 
percent neumeister said in a statement 
in june 1988 the delays caused by congestion problems were 
more than three times as many as in june 1986 he said 
in reality he said the picture is even worse since aea ontime 
figures do not include reactionary delays where inbound 
flights late due to insufficient air traffic control capacity 
delay outgoing flights 
normally flight punctuality drops during the winter months 
because of weather conditions and rises in the summer 
in 1988 the trend was reversed neumeister said he blamed 
this uncharacteristic drop on insufficient air traffic control 
capacity 
in recent months thousands of european vacationers have spent 
long hours at airports as their southbound charters were delayed 
by strikes by air traffic controllers in several countries

corn oat and soybean futures soared their 
permitted limits at todays opening on the chicago board of trade 
in reaction to the agriculture departments assessment of the 
droughts toll on crop production 
in a report issued after the markets closed on thursday the 
usda predicted this years us corn production would fall 37 
percent below last years harvest soybean production would decline 
by 23 percent and wheat production would drop by 14 percent 
analysts said the governments soybean production estimate of 
147 billion bushels the smallest harvest since 1976 was the 
biggest surprise 
the market must work higher to seek a price that will 
discourage usage or were simply going to run out of soybeans and 
the market wont let that happen said rich feltes director of 
commodties research for refco inc a chicagobased commodity

wholesale price inflation increased to an 
annual rate of 57 percent in july spurred by big boosts over a 
wide variety of products including clothing automobiles 
furniture and poultry the government said today 
the increase came despite lower prices for beef as the drought 
prompted farmers to slaughter more animals because of burnedout 
pastures and higher feed prices 
just three days after the federal reserve board initiated an 
increase in interest rates to fight inflation the labor department 
said wholesale prices rose 05 percent in july the same monthly 
increases as in may and march 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we would 
rather not see any increase in producer prices but we still 
believe inflation remains low and under control 
in june the departments producer price index for finished 
goods rose 04 percent or at an annual rate of 46 percent more 
than double the 22 percent rate of wholesale price inflation for 
all of 1987 
wholesale prices for consumer foods increased at a slower pace 
in july 04 percent than for goods overall indicating to some 
analysts that the worst immediate effects of the drought plaguing 
the farm belt were over food prices had been rising faster than 
prices for other products on the wholesale level since april 
overall energy prices meanwhile remained unchanged after a 16 
percent drop in june with a 3 percent seasonally adjusted increase 
in gasoline prices offsetting a 61 percent decline in what 
distributors pay for home heating oil 
excluding food and energy wholesale prices rose at 06 percent 
in july because food and energy prices are highly volatile from 
month to month most analysts look to price changes for other 
products as a better indication of underlying inflation 
analysts said the softer food prices partly offset what they 
called an overreaction in june to the drought 
as expected higher feed prices and burnedout pastures have 
sharply increased market slaughters and begun to influence meat 
prices said donald ratajczak director of economic forecasting 
at georgia state university in addition ratajczak said fruit 
trees under stress from the unusually hot weather are throwing off 
their fruit early resulting in a temporary early supply of 
fruit 
wholesale prices in july fell 25 percent for beef 105 percent 
for pork and 02 percent for soft drinks they rose 23 percent for 
fruit compared with a 67 percent increase in june 75 percent 
for vegetables 133 percent for bakery products 2 percent for 
chickens and 203 percent for processed turkeys 
rataczak predicted that meat prices will rise sharply in 1989 as 
a result of the early slaughters and fruit prices will spiral 
upwards this fall because of less than the usual supply then 
price increases were widespread across a wide variety of 
nonfood items mens clothing rose 09 percent drugs were up 11 
percent cosmetics increased 17 percent and auto prices edged up 
05 percent after a 1 percent decrease in june 
the only nonfood nonenergy consumer items for which wholesale 
prices fell last month were glassware down 23 percent and 
household flatware down 04 percent 
the july increase in finished goods overall put the labor 
departments index at 1085 that means a variety of goods costing 
100 at the wholesale level in 1982 cost 10850 last month 
compared with 10790 in june and 10600 a year ago 
wholesale prices for intermediate goods used in production rose 
07 percent in july indicating more inflation lies ahead despite 
the federal reserve boards decision tuesday to boost the rate it 
charges banks for credit from 6 percent to 65 percent 
prices for intermediate goods or those used in processing had 
risen 09 percent in june analysts said the smaller july increase 
was due almost entirely to a decline in oil prices before before 
opec members iran and iraq agreed late in the monthy to a 
ceasefire 
excluding food and energy prices for intermediate goods such as 
industrial chemicals finished steel products paper and synthetic 
fibers rose 07 percent overall 
however raw material prices fell 11 percent with crude oil 
prices plummeting 93 percent corn prices soared 20 percent on the 
drought but the increase was smaller than in june raw iron and 
steel prices jumpted 12 percent after holding fairly steady for 
three months 
price changes on the retail level usually lag one to three 
months behind those at wholesale consumer price inflation has been 
averaging 44 percent for the past 18 months july figures on 
consumer prices are to be published aug 23

american telephone amp telegraph co said friday 
it was offering a computerbased system for solving business 
problems that is based on a formula invented in 1984 by bell 
laboratories mathematician narendra karmarkar 
atampt said the system would cost 89 million including free 
training and would be ideal for customers such as airlines and 
companies in the process industries such as oil chemicals and 
paper 
the karmarkar algorithm greatly speeds up the solution of 
mathematical problems that involve the interaction of thousands of 
variables it was originally used to help atampt plan the growth of 
its phone network 
atampt said an airline for example could use the system to 
improve the efficiency of its routing system including the 
scheduling and allocation of planes and crews chemical companies 
could use it to balance the input of raw materials and the output 
of final products atampt said 
the system known as korbx is being offered by a new atampt unit 
advanced decision support systems based in whippany nj some 
systems but fewer than 10 have been sold said the new units 
president aristides fronistas 
the karmarkar algorithm traces a path inside the region of 
all potential solutions to a problem until it arrives at the best 
one an algorithm is simply a rule of thumb or a special method 
for solving a certain kind of problem 
bell laboratories received three patents related to the korbx 
system in may

californias retail stores would be 
able to charge unlimited interest rates on their creditcard 
accounts under legislation being considered by gov george 
deukmejian 
the proposal supported by the retailers but opposed by consumer 
groups would repeal during a threeyear period the current 18 
percent interest ceiling that was established 28 years ago bank 
credit cards would not be affected 
democratic state sen ralph dills who introduced the bill said 
current limit prevents stores from offering credit to poorer 
consumers 
the nolimit interest policy would open up some credit 
opportunities that dont exist at this time added democratic 
assemblyman dick floyd 
but critics charge the proposal would result in 450 million in 
additional interest charges over three years 
assemblyman lloyd connelly a democrat described the measure as 
clearly the worst consumer bill of the year he said california 
consumers pay an extra 50 million in interest rates for each 
percentage point added to interest rates by stores 
deukmejian in 1982 1984 and 1986 approved temporary increases 
in the interest limit to 192 percent however last year the 
governor vetoed another increase noting that the prime lending 
rate had fallen from over 20 percent in 1980 to between 8 percent 
and 9 percent in 1987 and the record is devoid of evidence 
supporting the need for the higher ceiling 
deukmejian who rarely discusses pending legislation has 
declined to discuss his position on the bill he has until the end 
of this month to decide its fate 
the assembly approved the bill in a 4922 vote monday the 
senate passed it in june 
the bill would take effect jan 1 1989 and expire three years 
later at which time the legislature could decide to extend or kill 
it based on a review by a nonpartisan state legislative analyst 
assemblyman frank hill a republican who was a key backer of the 
bill said that if stores are limited to 18 percent they can offer 
credit only to customers considered lower risks or raise their 
prices to compensate for the loss 
the current ceiling is hurting california consumers as well as 
the retail industry hill said deregulation would let the 
marketplace set the rates 
democratic assemblyman rusty aerias a critic of the bill said 
that a new york study found that stores actually did not offer poor 
people more credit after deregulation this is a reverse robin 
hood where were robbing from the poor he said 
according to an assembly finance committee 16 other states have 
deregulated retail credit

a severe shortage of computer memory chips is 
slowly beginning to ease but us electronics makers remain deeply 
concerned about their vulnerability to japans control of the 
critical components 
memory chips are the plywood of the worldwide electronics 
industry essential to products ranging from personal computers to 
copying machines 
the supply crunch has left us electronics makers wringing 
their hands over lost sales foregone profits delayed product 
introductions and worsened relations with customers 
although japanese companies such as nec corp hitachi ltd and 
toshiba corp account for 80 to 90 percent of worldwide sales of 
memory chips few people are accusing those companies of 
delibrately engineering the shortages 
in fact there is a shortage of memory chips inside japan which 
has surpassed the united states to become the worlds largest 
consumer of chips 
some major major major corporations in japan cant find 
product theyre coming to us said larry gurewitz an owner of 
hampr enterprises in canoga park calif which deals in used and 
surplus chips 
nevertheless the vulnerability of us companies to japanese 
suppliers has been highlighted by the chip squeeze the dominance 
in memory chips gives the japanese a base to solidify control of 
the products that use the chips 
the japanese have a large stake in supplanting usbased 
merchant producers as the providers of leadingedge chip 
technologies said michael g borrus deputy director of the 
berkeley roundtable on the international economy 
if the japanese companies succeed in gaining unquestioned 
leadership in chip technology they will be able to reserve the 
latest chips for their own computers phone switches satellites 
and other equipment before making them available to us and 
european rivals borrus said 
at stake for the us economy is not simply the 25 billion 
market for semiconductors but the current 05 trillion market for 
the final products that incorporate semiconductors soon to be a 1 
trillion market borrus writes in a new book competing for 
control americas stake in microelectronics 
so far the threat from japan is more theoretical than real for 
example toshiba the worlds biggest producer of 1megabit drams 
pronounced deerams allocates more than 60 percent of its output 
of the chips to us customers even though its own personal 
computer unit in japan is short on them 
but the potential for manipulation is starkly obvious 
especially considering that drams can account for up to a quarter 
of the cost of building a computer 
sun microsystems inc is one company that has felt the sting of 
the chip shortage the booming silicon valley maker of computer 
workstations which just cracked the 1 billion barrier in annual 
sales says its revenue would have been 100 million higher if chip 
shortages had not delayed deliveries 
sun occupies a market that japanese competitors have scarcely 
touched yet is heavily dependent on chips from companies that are 
potential rivals 
a similar dilemma faces another us computer industry star 
cray research inc which relies on japanesemade chips at the same 
time it fends off japanese challenges to its role as the worlds 
leading maker of supercomputers 
cray has never taken a position on whether a strong usbased 
semiconductor industry is needed 
ironically for all the problems of a chip shortage the 
greatest longterm danger to the us electronics industry could 
come from an eventual chip glut 
the last glut drove several of the biggest usbased dram 
suppliers out of the business because they could not afford the 
huge losses and the next one could wreak similar havoc 
japanese companies are better able to sustain losses on chips 
because they make other products that tide them over in the united 
states only international business machines corp is in a similar 
position ibm is the worlds largest dram producer but sells none 
to outsiders 
the only two usbased companies that still sell drams on the 
open market are texas instruments inc and micron technology inc 
which have earned windfall profits that will enable them to keep 
current on the technology 
for now a bust in memory chip prices is still a distant threat 
toshiba in a statement prepared for the associated press said 
we are afraid that the current unusual supplydemand relations 
will not ease until the middle of 1989 
shortages of the older 256kilobit drams could prevail even 
longer because production lines for them have been retooled for the 
new chips there are also growing shortages of 1megabit static 
random access memories or srams 
average us spot prices have fallen to 37 apiece in july from 
4750 in april for the most advanced memory chips in mass 
production the 1 millionbit dynamic random access memories known 
as 1megabit drams 
that is still way above the 1950 spot price that prevailed in 
july 1987 according to dataquest inc the market research firm 
in april some desperate customers paid as much as 65 apiece 
for small quantities of 1megabit drams according to mark giudice 
of dataquest it became common for companies to pillage memory 
chips from older computers and other equipment 
the supply squeeze in memory chips seems to have two main 
sources the main one being the sticky transition to the new 
hardtobuild megabit chips from the older 256kilobit variety 
producing the new chips demands unprecedented precision and 
cleanliness and it has taken chipmakers longer than expected to 
gear up production at the same time a boom in sales of personal 
computers and other gear has increased the demand for the chips 
a secondary reason for the squeeze is the 1986 accord between 
the united states and japan to prevent dumping of japanesemade 
chips at unfairly low prices in order to prop up prices to comply 
with the accord the japanese government instructed its chip makers 
to hold back on production 
that antidumping accord was supposed to lure more us 
companies back into producing drams by guaranteeing them some 
protection when chip prices begin skidding an inevitable process 
given the improving yields from existing fabrication lines and the 
startup of new ones 
so far though few companies have been lured back motorola 
inc is starting up dram production again but american telephone amp 
telegraph co in spite of the accord dropped out of the dram 
business last year 
the reluctance of us companies to enter or stay in the market 
is understandable considering the roughly 300 million it takes to 
build a stateoftheart fabrication plant and the boombust nature 
of chip prices 
in the long run many analysts say sustaining a healthy chip 
industry in the united states will probably depend on more 
government initiatives such as the antidumping accord and 
importantly closer cooperation between us chipmakers and us 
chip users 
were both realizing that adversarial isnt the best way to 
go said stan victor a texas instruments spokesman

car owners involved in a lawsuit alleging some of 
audi of americas cars are defective are forming a barricuda 
network to attack the company after a judge threw out a tentative 
settlement a company official contended friday 
cook county circuit judge thomas rakowski on thursday threw out 
the proposed settlement between the company and a class of audi car 
owners who alleged that audi 5000 sedans suddenly accelerate 
without warning 
i sense a barricuda network setting up where everybody wants 
to get a piece of the meat and to get into the deep pockets of 
audi said tom mcdonald a spokesman for volkswagen of america 
inc of which troy michbased audi is a subsidiary 
mcdonald contended friday that the audi victims network a group 
of audi car owners based in washington dc was advising some of 
its members to withdraw from the classaction lawsuit and file 
individual lawsuits against the company such a move could cost the 
company thousands of dollars in legal fees he said 
mcdonald said only 1500 of the 340000 owners of the audi 
sedans covered by the proposed settlement of the classaction 
lawsuit refused to agree to it he blamed the settlements 
rejection on the victims network 
the audi victims network has not been a headache to us its 
been a major disease to audi mcdonald said 
stephen nassau an attorney for the victims network said he had 
advised his clients to withdraw from the classaction suit because 
under terms of the proposed settlement owners would have had to 
buy another audi 
the group of about 800 audi owners contend their cars suddenly 
accelerate without warning nassau said 
some people have put their cars away and refuse to drive or 
sell them he said why would they want to buy another one 
i would say if we were barricudas there must be sharks 
circling in the waters as well he said referring to audi 
officials trying to eliminate complaints from car owners 
the case stems from a 1987 classaction lawsuit alleging that 
audi 5000s were defective because of sudden acceleration problems 
the settlement would have applied to owners of audi 5000s built 
between 1978 and 1986 
audi officials maintain that owners have been unable to prove 
their audi 5000 sedans have any defects and say the settlement 
rejected by rakowski is fair 
under terms of the settlement proposed in june by attorneys for 
both sides audi car owners who bought another audi would have been 
offered rebates of up to 2000 but would have had to free the 
company from all liability 
the judge recommended thursday that both sides try to negotiate 
a new settlement and report any progress at a hearing scheduled for 
aug 31 
after the ruling we have to look at all our options 
mcdonald said one option is to renegotiate the other is to 
litigate 
nassau said the victims network may ask the judge to let them 
become a third party in the case 
theres no question that were going to be watching to see 
what happens next nassau said a day after rakowski approved his 
motion to throw out a previous judges ruling giving preliminary 
approval to the settlement 
nassaus motion called for vacating circuit judge harold 
siegans earlier ruling contending the judge had not given 
proper scrutiny to the matter before approving it 
after giving the proposed settlement the preliminary goahead 
siegan removed himself from the case in july saying he had a 
potential conflict of interest because he was friends with an 
attorney in the case 
thursdays ruling was a victory for the center for auto safety 
a washingtonbased group formed by consumer activist ralph nader 
the center contended that the audi acceleration problem was linked 
to at least 1650 accidents causing 402 injuries and five deaths

at least five groups of insilco corp 
shareholders have filed suit against the company seeking to thwart 
a 950 million managementled leveraged buyout they consider 
grossly unfair and inadequate 
insilcos board of directors accepted the 29ashare offer 
earlier this month in what some analysts described as an 
antitakeover defense for the hightechnology and specialty 
consumer products concern 
in a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely with 
boreowed money repaid from the target companys profits or asset 
sales 
stockholders want to prevent that deal from being completed in 
complaints filed in new haven superior court they charge insilco 
would be worth a lot more in an open auction for the company 
the directors have the duty to maximize shareholder value 
william barnes an attorney for sam and marilyn pill of brooklyn 
ny wrote in one of five civil suits filed tuesday 
insilco disclosed in filings with the securities and exchange 
commission last week that it received several unsolicited buyout 
offers since the management bid it said it entered into 
confidentiality agreements with certain groups but declined to 
identify the parties 
insilco vice president and treasurer malcolm todt said thursday 
the company believes the tender offer from management is fair 
named as defendants were insilco 12 directors and isc holdings 
inc the new holding company created by insilco management to 
acquire the meridenbased company 
in recent years insilco once known as the international silver 
co has restructured itself into an industrial holding company 
with operating companies that make products for hightechnology 
industries and speciality consumer markets 
insilco makes red devil paints rolodex rotary files metal 
cartridges and other projectiles for the defense industry and 
duallite emergency lighting equipment 
insilco earned 117 million or 55 cents per share in the 
second quarter compared with 11 million or 52 cents a share 
last year revenue totaled 1964 million up from 1543 million

grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower 
friday on the chicago board of trade surprising many analysts who 
had expected a strong performance following the governments crop 
production report 
corn oat and soybean futures opened sharply higher as expected 
but corn prices plunged their permitted daily limit shortly after 
the opening sparking a selloff in the adjacent trading pits only 
oat futures closed higher while most corn futures finished down the 
10centsabushel limit 
its astonishing said katharina zimmer grain analyst with 
merrill lynch capital markets in new york 
in a report issued after the markets closed on thursday the 
usda predicted the drought would lower this years us corn 
production by 37 compared to last year the agency estimated 
soybean production at 23 percent below last years level and said 
wheat production would drop by 14 percent 
i guess the markets may be giving us a signal today that the 
usda report did not provide any new bullish information that wasnt 
already in the market said mario balletto merill lynchs 
soybean analyst 
balletto said traders apparently want to see signs of new export 
business before they are willing to bet on higher prices 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 380 a bushel corn was 4 
cents to 10 cents lower with september at 287 a bushel oats 
were 4 cents to 6 cents higher with september at 280 a bushel

rate the interest the fed charges on loans to major financial 
institutions was the first such hike since last octobers stock 
market crash a rise in interest rates sends bond prices lower

economy many market watchers had expected the fed to tighten its 
reins on the money supply but few were anticipating that dramatic 
a move 
its just been a lousy week said mitchell held chief 
financial economist for smith barney harris upham amp co 
he suggested that fridays more tempered decline in bond values

percent

an investment firm owned by a disney 
family scion sweetened its takeover bid for polaroid corp on 
friday and the camera companys board met for six hours before 
postponing action on the offer 
analysts interpreted the new offer by shamrock holdings inc of 
burbank calif as an effort to gradually raise the stakes for the 
instant camera pioneer 
its all part of a very delicate quadrille being danced by a 
large number of players and all were seeing is the first two 
steps one wall street analyst said 
shamrocks new offer was 40 a share plus giving stockholders 
the right to 40 percent of any settlement in polaroids 57 
billion patent infringement case against eastman kodak co 
that bettered the july 22 bid which offered a flat 40 a share 
for polaroid or about 23 billion but attached several 
contingencies 
on wall street polaroids stock fell 1 a share to 4212 
after the board meeting polaroid said in a statement no action 
was taken because of the new bid the 13member board planned to 
meet again to consider the offer but no date was set spokeswoman 
marcia phillips said 
analysts said shamrocks bid fell short of what polaroid would 
be willing to consider but might be part of a strategy to heighten 
interest in the company that introduced instant snapshots more than 
50 years ago 
i think they dont expect it to be a blitzkrieg said peter 
enderlin of smith barney harris upham amp co i think theyre 
prepared for a drawnout struggle or possibly even drawnout 
negotiations 
shamrock wholly owned by the family of roy e disney nephew of 
the late walt disney has interests in three television and 14 
radio stations an energy services company and 56 home 
entertainment software stores in los angeles 
the company failed in an attempt last year to acquire wherehouse 
entertainment inc which analysts said raises questions about its 
ability to go after polaroid which reported sales of 133 billion 
last year 
theyre trying to prove theyre for real but nobodys too 
sure said william relyea of eberstadt fleming inc theres a 
very healthy degree of skepticism about what theyre up to 
in its new bid shamrock which owns 69 percent of polaroid 
rescinded an earlier requirement making a deal contingent on 
polaroid dropping a 190 million pension surplus plan but it said 
it would continue to fight a recently announced employee stock 
ownership plan that includes the issue of 10 million new shares 
shamrock said it had retained wertheim schroder amp co and drexel 
burnham lambert inc to assist in securing about 1 billion in 
financing the new offer was made in a letter from shamrock 
chairman stanley gold to polaroid president i macallister booth 
we are willing to meet with you at any time to discuss how 
best to implement the furnishing of such an interest to polaroids 
shareholders gold wrote in the letter dated thursday and 
released friday 
shamrock has filed suit in a delaware court seeking to overturn 
the employee stock plan part of a corporate restructuring that 
includes 500 to 800 layoffs a 300 million stock repurchase and 
entry into the conventional film market polaroid is officially a 
delaware company 
under delaware law an acquiring company must have at least 85 
percent of the target companys stock to complete a merger by 
placing 14 percent of its stock in employee hands polaroid has 
effectively put the 85 percent target out of reach 
shamrocks lawsuit charges that polaroid enacted the plan as an 
antitakeover device polaroid said in march the plan would equal 5 
percent of company stock but raised the amount about 10 days before 
the first shamrock bid 
analysts called the new bid speculative because it depends on 
settling the patent infringement case against kodak which was 
found guilty in 1985 of violating several polaroid patents on 
instant cameras and film the 57 billion damages trial is set to 
begin in january 
shamrocks takeover bid values the company at about 288 
billion if all 719 million shares remain outstanding if the stock 
issue is rolled back the value of the company implied by the bid 
would be 248 billion 
since shamrock already owns a chunk of polaroid stock its cost 
to buy the rest would be 228 billion assuming defeat of the 
share issue or 268 billion if the share issue is not defeated

british publisher robert maxwell said friday he 
will launch a 21 billion cash tender offer for macmillan inc 
next week but made clear his main interest is acquiring its 
information services business 
macmillan already is the subject of a 19 billion bid from 
robert m bass group inc a texasbased investment group 
in a letter to macmillan maxwell said he would drop his 
80ashare tender offer if macmillan would sell him the 
information company which macmillan proposed to separate from its 
publishing business in a corporate restructuring 
maxwell said his maxwell communications corp plc would be 
willing to pay not less than 11 billion in cash for the 
information business noting that macmillans investment bankers 
had valued it at a range of 800 million to slightly in excess of 
1 billion 
in the letter maxwell also told macmillan chairman edward p 
evans he was willing to explore other forms of transactions with 
you that would allow current shareholders to continue to hold a 
significant stake in the company 
maxwell also reitereated he wanted to retain macmillan 
management 
macmillan declined to comment on maxwells proposals 
on wall street the price of macmillan stock rose 150 a share 
to 8325 indicating investors expected the bidding to escalate 
some people suggested maxwell isnt serious but by launching 
a tender offer at 80 a share on monday we see he is serious 
said bert boksen who follows the publishing business for the 
brokerage raymond james amp associates in st petersburg fla 
but boksen said by making the alternate suggestion that he be 
sold the information assets maxwell identified the piece he is 
most interested in 
i think macmillan is backed up against the wall and will try 
to find a white knight he said he said macmillan could be worth 
90 a share 
the overture from maxwell came only three days before a 
scheduled court hearing in delaware on whether macmillan should be 
allowed to proceed with its proposed restructuring 
the restructuring announced in late may would split the 
company into separate publishing and information services concerns 
and pay shareholders a special dividend of 5235 a share in cash 
that plan was advanced after the bass group proposed to pay 64 
a share for the macmillan stock it did not already own the bass 
group subsequently sweetened its offer twice and launched its own 
tender offer for macmillan at 75 a share 
the bass group won an order from delaware chancery court 
blocking macmillan from proceeding with its restructuring 
macmillan appealed the decision to delaware supreme court which 
scheduled a hearing for monday 
maxwell disclosed his interest in macmillan in midjuly saying 
he would be interested in paying 80 a share for its 259 million 
shares in a friendly transaction 
a maxwell spokesman said friday that the tender offer at that 
price would commence on monday it is contingent on dropping the 
restructuring plan among other things but maxwell said it is not 
conditioned upon obtaining necessary financing 
late last month the macmillan board rejected the 75 a share 
offer from bass as inadequate but took no position on the maxwell 
proposal 
macmillan spokesman david jackson refused friday to comment on 
whether the board has since met to discuss the maxwell proposal or 
anything else 
maxwell has vowed to make maxwell communications one of the 
worlds biggest media and communications businesses through that 
company and pergamon press maxwell controls the mirror group of 
newspapers in great britain is one of americas largest printers 
of magazines and catlogues and has extensive holdings in publishing 
academic and scientific journals

the chicago board of trade astonishing analysts who had expected a 
strong performance following the governments pessimistic crop 
production report 
the volatility of the grain markets attributed by some to 
massive trades by a handful of firms sent tremors through several 
other commodity markets that frequently look to chicago for 
direction 
sugar and cotton futures plunged livestock and meat futures 
were mostly lower precious metals advanced energy futures were 
lower and stockindex futures retreated 
corn oat and soybean futures opened sharply higher as expected

adjacent trading pits 
only oat futures closed higher while most corn futures finished 
limit down 
its astonishing said katharina zimmer grain analyst with 
merrill lynch capital markets in new york i really dont 
understand it 
ive been doing this for eight years and this is my most 
frustrating day ever said richard loewy senior grain and 
oilseed analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
in a report issued thursday afternoon the agriculture 
department predicted the midwestern drought would lower this years 
us corn production by 37 percent soybean production by 23 
percent and wheat production by 14 percent compared to last years 
yields 
analysts had expected a sharp rise in crop futures prices 
friday reflecting the increasing value of diminishing grain 
supplies but after the initial surge several large trading firms 
sold huge amounts of corn which sent corn prices plummeting 
traders said chicagobased campd commodities sold at least 20 
million bushels of corn alone other large sellers reportedly 
included refco inc shearson lehman hutton inc and merrill lynch 
futures inc 
loewy said a handful of firms were bullying the grain markets 
but mario balletto merrill lynchs soybean analyst said the 
selloff would not had occurred if the markets major players had 
truly been surprised by the usda crop estimates 
i guess the markets may be giving us a signal today that the 
usda report did not provide any new bullish information that wasnt 
already in the market balletto said 
wheat settled 1 cent to 3 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in september at 379 bushel corn was 3 cents to 10 
cents lower with september at 287 a bushel oats were 4 cents 
to 6 cents higher with september at 280 a bushel soybeans were 
12 cents lower to 2 cents higher with august at 848 a bushel

virtually every analyst was expecting a reduction 
cotton futures settled down the 2centsapound limit across the 
board on the new york cotton exchange with the contract for october 
delivery at 5328 cents a pound 
sugar futures followed the grain markets wild swing and closed 
sharply lower on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange 
theres an old saying when in doubt get out said erik 
dunlaevy a sugar trader with balfour maclaine corp in new york 
if you dont understand the market dont get into it get out of 
it 
sugar for october delivery settled 63 cent lower at 1077 cents 
a pound 
cattle and pork futures finished mixed to lower on the chicago 
mercantile exchange analysts said the lower grain futures 
portending lower feed prices and possibly higher meat supplies 
were the main influence 
live cattle settled 18 cent lower to 23 cent higher with 
august at 6915 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent lower to 
15 cent higher with august at 8105 cents a pound hogs were 112

prices of its 1989 automobiles an average of 29 percent because of 
higher manufacturing costs 
new prices announced by gm president robert stempel include 
increases up to 46 percent for the redesigned larger 1989 
cadillac sedan deville and more than 5 percent from current 
discounted levels for the popular chevrolet corsica fourdoor sedan 
prices of some cars including gms most expensive the 56533 
cadillac allante and its least expensive the 6399 pontiac 
lemans coupe will be unchanged gm comptroller john e rhame said 
however stempel said discounts on options have cut prices of 
some models enough so that even with the increases their 1989 
introductory prices will be down from a year earlier 
for example the 1989 introductory prices for the chevrolet 
corsica and beretta two of our most popular cars are on average 4 
percent to 5 percent lower than their comparably equipped 
counterparts at 1988 introductory price levels he said 
rhame said that as an example the manufacturers suggested 
retail price at the start of the 1988 model year for a corsica with 
options including air conditioning automatic transmission tilt 
wheel tinted glass rear window defogger and cruise control was 
11618 
with options discounts the price of that car now would be 
10618 he said for 1989 it will be 11168 a 52 percent 
increase but still down 39 percent from the 1988 introductory 
level 
the base price of the cadillac sedan deville will rise to 
25435 from 23404 for 1988 rhame said 
the highvolume chevrolet cavalier 4door sedan will have a base 
price of 8595 up from 8195 with the addition of rearseat 
shoulder belts as standard equipment for 1989 he said 
base prices will drop on some models such as the oldsmobile 
cutlass calais twodoor coupe which will start at 9995 down 
from a 1988 base price of 10320 
gms light truck prices will increase an average of 3 percent 
rhame said although specific truck prices were not released 
earlier this month ford motor co announced price increases for 
1989 ranging from 19 percent to 53 percent on six of its most 
popular cars 
chrysler said in late july it will raise 1989 prices an average
