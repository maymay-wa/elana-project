the victims arrive day and night at the 
sandbagged red cross hospital men with shattered legs or stomachs 
ripped open by bullets and children burned by antimissile flares 
there are fears of worse to come as the last of the soviet troops 
depart afghanistan in the next few weeks to try to meet a feb 15 
deadline 
the nations promarxist regime led by president najib will be 
left with its poorly trained army to face the guerrillas alone and 
some western diplomats say the guerrillas will win 
gunfire and explosions have been heard regularly the past few 
nights and rifletoting afghan soldiers are deployed throughout the 
city 
the swissrun international red cross opened the 50bed hospital 
in october in a villa beside the frozen kophen river in central 
kabul it has 16 foreign and 140 afghan staff members 
victims arrive in ancient taxis or are carried by relatives 
some of the latest arrivals were shot or wounded hours earlier by 
mines which are planted around kabul and villages in the 
surrounding hills 
other victims were wounded weeks or months ago and have infected 
limbs sometimes the result of botched surgery at government 
hospitals 
as several victims arrived ingrid andersson the swedish chief 
nurse cajoled an apprehensive middleaged man into giving blood for 
the relative he had brought in with shrapnel wounds to the chest 
minutes later word came that seven more patients were on their 
way nurses chased relatives from a waiting area to make room and 
set up brightly colored lounge chairs as temporary beds 
theres a lot of shooting in the city most of the ones coming 
now seem to have been hit by stray bullets said dr kari 
koskinen a finnish surgeon 
koskinens threemember team and one led by dr brian hewitson a 
british surgeon who arrived this week alternate shifts and are on 
call around the clock 
most of the foreign staff from a halfdozen western european 
countries and australia new zealand and canada have worked civil 
wars in asia africa and lebanon and in thailands refugee camps 
many say they sense there is a lot more killing to come in 
afghanistan 
the guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 since 
then an estimated 1 million people have been killed in the civil 
war and onethird of the nations population of 15 million has 
sought refuge in neighboring pakistan and iran 
in the past two weeks the red cross has readied a 100bed 
extension to the hospital 
i just have the impression that this is the beginning of a 
very very bad time said robert keusen a swiss radiographer and 
laboratory technician who arrived eight months ago from uganda we 
could set up a hospital for 500 patients for 1000 it would still 
be too small 
but somehow the hospital staff finds room for the wounded 
beds are jammed together an old man with leg injuries lay 
semiconscious next to a cheerful 12yearold boy who was shot in 
the spine four months ago during a clash betweeen guerrillas and 
government troops outside kabul the boy will never walk again 
a 10yearold girl shows a visitor the healing burns that cover 
her left leg 
at the red cross artificial limb center in the citys industrial 
district french physiotherapist christoph etienne makes tough 
choices daily 
theres a waiting list of 1500 most of the patients are 
disabled soldiers but women and children get priority followed by 
young men over old and amputees with one leg over people who have 
lost both legs and are least capable of using artificial limbs 
the center opened in 1987 making it the first international 
facility the afghan government allowed into the country to help the 
warwounded 
the red cross has run hospitals and clinics in pakinstan 
throughout most of the afghan conflict mainly serving civilians and 
guerrillas

thousands of jubilant republicans celebrated 
george bushs brandnew presidency at 11 inaugural balls friday 
night and during a fastpaced tour of the merrymaking bush took a 
few reluctant whirls around the dance floor 
he called himself a lousy dancer and told one crowd rocking 
to the music of lionel hampton i hope you dont judge my being a 
president by the way i dance 
a chill wind whipped evening gowns and fur stoles as 60000 party 
faithful thronged from union station to the national air and space 
museum to the kennedy center on the banks of the moonlit potomac for 
a night of dancing and carousing 
inside the kennedy center the air was hot and thick as 5000 
guests were jammed shouldertoshoulder in the grand foyer to 
awaiting the presidents arrival several people fainted and for 
one woman the crowd was so dense that she couldnt fall down after 
she passed out 
hours after he was sworn in as president reagans successor on 
the steps of the capitol bush began his tour of the invitationonly 
balls with a visit to an american legion affair for 149 medal of 
honor winners including freshman sen bob kerrey dneb and 
other military heroes 
ill do my level best to be a president who respects the 
military and keeps the united states of america strong said 
bush who was accompanied by former rep edward derwinski rill 
his choice to be secretary of the new department of veterans affairs 
bush also let slip that hes not particularly keen on dancing 
this is the first formal event and perhaps the most humane 
he said a ball at which you do not have to dance 
but by the time he reached union station the president finally 
took his wife barbara onto the dance floor as the band struck up 
i could have danced all night 
you can say that you saw it first here bush said a lousy 
dancer trying to dance his first dance with the first lady of the 
united states of america 
a while later at the cavernous pension building the president 
quipped the bush family is going to give dancing a bad name he 
took a few turns with mrs bush and stopped abruptly thats it 
he said thats the only step i know 
vice president dan quayle apparently felt the same way he told 
revelers at another hotel ballroom that i guess protocol allows 
you to witness my inability to dance quayle then took a few stiff 
turns on the dance floor with his wife marilyn as the band played 
a tune from my fair lady 
tickets to the nine crowded blacktie balls sold for 175 each 
assuring guests the privilege of jostling for drinks at cash bars 
and catching brief glimpses of bush and quayle tickets were easier 
t obtain for two casualdress balls for the 30andunder crowd 
where the drinks had more fizz than kick 
to be included in this is incredible said kerry trost 16 
of fairfax va who got her 30 ticket from a friend and joined 
several thousand other youngsters in dancing to loud recorded rock 
music and videos 
when bush showed up at one of the youth balls he recalled the 
inaugural parade and said it was the young people that brought 
that thing alive 
outside one hotel a group protesting the killing of animals for 
their fur hides picketed arriving guests many of whom wore fur 
coats the demonstrators carried signs reading fur is murder 
and im warm im not wearing fur 
a star of one hotel ball was 7yearold jessica catonia the 
current little miss buffalo the girls mother sharon said her 
daughter was conceived at the same hotel during reagans first 
inauguration in 1981 
before the hoopla began inaugural officials had said a 175 
ticket to the blacktie events reserved for invited guests would 
get them little more than the honor of being there bars at each 
site were charging for drinks there was no food and the dance 
floors promised to be gridlocked 
the partying continues saturday with scores of social events 
around the capital including a black tie and boots ball for 
5500 texans that sold out within 24 hours 
the four days of inaugural festivities costing a record 22 
million to 25 million will end with a sunday morning worship 
service at washington cathedral which was requested by bush 
one highlight of the week was a twohour variety show thursday 
night at the washington convention center where bush and quayle 
joined 12000 blacktie guests in applauding bigname performers 
from frank sinatra to country singer loretta lynn 
the gala was broadcast live on television and grossed about 9 
million from ticket and tv commercial sales to help defray costs of 
the privately financed inauguration week 
meanwhile those protesting the policies of the reagan 
administration and what they fear will be those of the bush 
administration held their own counterinaugural ball at the crispus 
attucks museum on friday night with a 6 to 10 sliding scale 
admission charge 
the dance party was arranged by the counterinaugural coalition 
for a peoples agenda a coalition of 80 groups ranging from the 
gray panthers to the student coalition against apartheid and racism 
those attending were asked to wear their finest trash said 
michael hasty of the washington peace center a member of the 
coalition live music was planned for the first hour followed by a 
disk jockey playing tapes so people can dance the night away

a restaurateur who held an exotic 
maledance show to raise money for a shelter for the homeless says 
she doesnt understand why some people objected to the show 
i cant understand the uproar over fridays show said sandra 
beaudin owner of the mountainview restaurant in this northwestern 
massachusetts town i just thought it would be nice for patrons 
to donate 10 and get something in return 
however some people in nearby north adams strenuously objected 
to the show saying they believed it was in poor taste 
i dont think its right to hire male dancers for a cause like 
this said city council member paul babeu it tarnishes it 
somewhat 
ms beaudin said she sold all 220 tickets nearly a week before 
the twohour performance and said she was pleased it all worked out 
well 
now i feel fine she said i was just hoping it went well 
because it really is to benefit the homeless people are just having 
a good time 
ticket sales brought in about 2000 the money will go to a 
24bed shelter for the areas homeless which welfare workers say is 
urgently needed to house the increasing numbers of families seeking 
shelter 
northern berkshire community action a branch of the private 
nonprofit berkshire community action council which uses state 
grants to help the homeless has been handling 10 to 15 family or 
individual cases a month said branch director theresa louison that 
compares with one case every month or two five years ago 
ms beaudin said the situation prompted her to look for a 
creative solution she held a spaghetti supper fundraiser in 
november but made only 900 she said she saw the dance as an 
easier way to raise money 
the clarksburg board of selectmen waived the usual 75 
entertainment license fee so ms beaudin could use the money to hire 
police guards 
she has the right to put it on if its done properly and there 
is no physical contact said selectman edward deneault who added 
that he had heard no complaints from people in the town of 1890 
people most of the people doing the complaining are from north 
adams

morton thiokol successfully tested its 
redesigned space shuttle booster friday firing the rocket in colder 
weather than that which contributed to the challenger disaster 
the nation has a new president today and a new success in its 
space flight program said royce mitchell nasas solidfuel 
rocket motor project manager at the marshall space flight center in 
huntsville ala 
the 20 million test the last of six qualifying tests was 
designed to show the strength of the rockets casing and the 
behavior of its solidfuel propellant which hasnt as much 
oomph in cold weather mitchell said 
early test data showed the propellants burn rate was normal for 
the conditions and there was no evidence of the uneven burning that 
could have occurred at that temperature he said 
the horizontal 126footlong booster its 11 million pounds of 
propellant chilled to a coldestever 40 degrees was fired for 125 
seconds at the companys wasatch operations center 25 miles west of 
here 
the bright orange plume from the rockets tail melted the snow 
from a nearby hillside during the test which was delayed for 90 
minutes by a lack of wind to blow away dust from the blast about 
300 company and space officials cheered as the rocket ignited 
if posttest analysis turns up no serious problems the 
experiment will qualify the rocket for coldweather launches 
although further testing on a smaller scale is planned said allan 
mcdonald vice president of engineering for space operations 
identical boosters already have been used on two shuttle flights 
in the four months since americas return to manned space flight 
the national aeronautics and space administration ordered morton 
thiokol to redesign the booster after a jan 28 1986 explosion 
destroyed the shuttle challenger and killed its seven astronauts 
nasa required only five qualifying tests before the shuttle 
program resumed with the launch of discovery on sept 29 the 
shuttle atlantis was sent into space dec 2 and in both cases the 
boosters performed with no problems 
a presidential commission blamed the challenger disaster on a 
booster joint that allowed a plume of superhot gas to burn through 
an oring triggering the explosion of the crafts liquid fuel tank 
investigators also found that freezing temperatures the night 
before the launch stiffened the joints rubberlike oring seal 
causing it to lose pliability and contributing to the failure

nets firecrackers and recordings of killer whales 
havent stopped sea lions from gobbling trout and salmon swimming 
through a ship canal so wildlife officials are going to send the 
overeaters into exile 
this years run of steelhead a seagoing rainbow trout that 
returns to fresh water to spawn was about 1650 at a fish ladder 
that lets fish bypass a set of locks down from about 2600 last 
year officials said this week 
seven to nine california sea lions hanging around the locks 
are gulping an average of 14 fish a day each said bob byrne state 
wildlife department spokesman 
despite a net barrier erected last year the 300 to 800pound 
animals ate 53 percent of the run byrne said sea lions eat 5 
percent of their body weight daily said susan ewing a department 
spokeswoman 
the new plan calls for installing a cage near the mouth of salmon 
bay below the locks on the lake washington ship canal in seattles 
ballard section said tag gornall a marine animal resource center 
veterinarian 
the cage of fivesixteenthsinch steel mesh will be mounted on a 
buoy that was a favorite sea lion resting place and will have a trap 
door that can be closed by rope from a nearby boat said bob delong 
of the national marine fisheries service mammals laboratory 
sea lions heading for their usual easy pickings in the pool below 
the fish ladder at the locks will be trapped tagged with radio 
collars and trucked about 200 miles to the long beach peninsula 
just north of the mouth of the columbia river and released on the 
coast 
long beach peninsula was chosen because you cant extradite 
them gornall said and besides california and oregon have 
enough of their own sea lions and dont want any more 
asked about the difficulty of moving one of the animals delong 
said it could be about the same as moving a leather bag filled 
with 600 pounds of rocks 
delong said he expects the sea lions will be back for more fish 
perhaps as soon as five days after they are removed he said the 
animals migrate from their baja california breeding grounds every 
year and they know the route 
i reckon theyll know where they are when we put them off the 
pacific coast he said 
the operation will begin as soon as the cage is completed said 
ms ewing 
the feasting sea lions have been the bane of fishermen and others 
concerned about the salmon run but have delighted residents and 
tourists who flock to the locks to watch the spectacle and applaud 
the frolicking animals 
the sea lions have become a problem at the locks only in the last 
couple of years scientists have said sealion populations have been 
growing since federal legislation protecting marine mammals took 
effect several years ago 
only one or two sea lions feasted outside the lake washington 
ship canal in 1984 but others caught on quickly wildlife 
department spokeswoman susan ewing said 
they kind of see their buddies over there since 1984 that one 
or two has grown to the neighborhood of 20 problem animals she 
said 
along with firecracker noisemakers and recordings of sea lion 
predators such as killer whales offerings of dead fish injected 
with a sickening substance failed as deterrents rubber bullets have 
been rejected for now 
we must exhaust all other viable options before we even 
consider shooting the sea lions the last option gornall said 
were trying to save and manage the fishery and the animals

former president reagan and his wife say there 
are no movie parts in his future but they both plan to keep busy in 
the home state that reagan says is not so much a place as a way of 
life 
i dont even use the word retirement reagan told reporters 
aboard the air force plane that flew him here friday after the 
inauguration of president bush 
the former president and first lady came back toward the 
reporters seats early in their flight west and answered questions 
for about 20 minutes 
when the plane arrived at los angeles international airport the 
reagans were greeted by an enthusiastic crowd and then driven to 
their new home in the fashionable bel air neighborhood by motorcade 
their spokesman mark weinberg said they planned a private 
weekend and no announcements would be made about their activities 
were just moving into a new house said reagan we didnt 
get the job done over the holidays when we were there 
the reagans slept a total of nine nights in the home around 
christmas and just after new years day 
obviously we have to unpack said mrs reagan 
reagan a movie actor before he entered politics was asked if he 
couldnt be tempted to reenter films even in a cameo part 
no there is kind of a lingering feeling that would look a 
little bit like trying to cash in on this job that ive had he 
said 
but a reporter asked aside from making money wouldnt it be 
appropriate to go back to what he did before politics 
well said the former president 
you dont go back said his wife 
no he agreed 
reagan said he plans to write a book and to speak out on behalf 
of such causes as a presidential lineitem veto a balanced budget 
amendment to the constitution and repeal of the twoterm limit for 
presidents 
mrs reagan said she doesnt believe in retirement either and 
plans to finish a book she is writing and work on behalf of a drug 
abuse treatment center she is backing in the los angeles area 
reagan who had changed to a blue air force jacket with his name 
on the pocket after boarding the plane told reporters he was 
prepared to hand over power to bush for a long time i had to 
accept this day and know it was coming he said 
returning to california he said will be a return to a life we 
did love very much california isnt a place in my mind its a way 
of life so that is the sweet part of the bittersweet experience 
there was just one more thing mrs reagan said that the reagans 
wanted to clear up 
he never took naps she said bringing the subject up 
herself no in eight years he never took a nap 
she sometimes gets edgy because she thinks i should be able to 
take a nap the former president said 
at the airport reagan told the crowd it had been a bittersweet 
several hours this day and added i have to warn you when you 
have to stay eight years away from california excerpt for an 
occasional visit you live in a perpetual state of homesickness 
reagan spent 458 days in california during his eight years as 
president by contrast his predecessor jimmy carter spent 77 days 
in his native georgia during his one fouryear term

rights said now president molly yard 
in a separate demonstration four washington women three 
wearing rubber masks of ronald and nancy reagan and george bush 
marched along the pennsylvania avenue sidewalk wearing signs 
protesting the extravagance of the inauguration and contrasting it 
to the nations need to address problems of the homeless aids and 
other social issues 
this is pretty much like a coronation in a monarchy said amy 
barehr the only difference is george bush isnt ronald reagans 
son 
as the bushes moved by in their car other protesters shook their 
fists and jeered but were virtually drowned out by cheers 
meanwhile members of the counterinaugural coalition for a 
peoples agenda a coalition of 80 groups ranging from the gray 
panthers to the committee in solidarity with the people of el 
salvador distributed thousands of leaflets calling for changes in 
administration policies their slogan was 1000 sparks of 
dissent 
the coalition called for all people to have the right to 
adequate food housing clothing and quality health care and 
education in addition the coalition called for a clean 
environment the right to safe legal abortions and no 
discrimination against minority groups or aids victims 
we demand a government responsive to the needs of the people 
and the planet rather than corporate and military interests the 
group said

the national aeronautics and space 
administration is looking for a kind of radar that can spot orbiting 
debris as small as a dime which someday could pose a hazard to its 
planned space station 
the space agency has access to space debris reports from the air 
force but it says information is still extremely limited about 
the number and size of small debris pieces at the operational 
altitude range of the space station 
the station will operate 180 to 360 miles above earth 
nasa needs radar that can see debris as small as one centimeter 
in diameter compared with the 10centimeter capability of current 
systems the new equipment also would need to calculate the altitude 
of the objects 
a request issued this week for proposals specifies that the new 
system must be available by october 1991 the space station named 
freedom is scheduled to be in orbit in 1996 
as of jan 11 the air force was tracking 7087 pieces of space 
junk 3142 put into orbit by the united states and 3302 left 
behind by soviet spacecraft 
space junk has included items such as screws 18inch in 
diameter missing after a 1984 space shuttle mission a thermal glove 
that floated out of gemini 4 in 1965 and a screwdriver dropped by a 
spacewalking astronaut aboard the soviet mir space station 
even the smallest pieces of orbital debris pose a potential 
hazard to the space station nasa said it is important that the 
pressurized modules of freedom be built to withstand as much orbital 
debris damage as possible 
the station is planned to remain in earth orbit for up to 30 
years

president bush led his inaugural parade of 
floats bands and military marchers up pennsylvania avenue walking 
for a time under bright sunshine along the route to the white house 
he now calls home 
bush and his wife barbara emerged three times from their 
armorplated limousine to walk along parts of the parade route from 
the capitol to the mansion at 1600 pennsylvania avenue where they 
have a fouryear lease 
at one point the first lady left her husbands side and rushed 
over to kiss television weatherman willard scott who was 
broadcasting from the sidelines 
the bushes followed by vice president quayle and his wife 
marilyn and the quayles children walked the final leg of the 
16mile parade route past the us treasury and into the 
presidential reviewing stand outside the white house 
for nearly three hours the president and his new vicepresident 
sat with their families cabinet officers supreme court justices 
and other guests to review floats bands dance troupes and 
equestrian teams representing all 50 states 
darkness fell and bonechilling cold set in before some 12000 
marchers 70 floats and 457 horses had filed past the presidential 
reviewing stand most of the people who paid 100 a seat in 
bleachers nearest the white house had left long before the parade 
ended 
for the finale bush and his guests stood to sing the battle 
hymn of the republic with the mormon tabernacle choir which 
arrived on a white float bearing the slogan peace prosperity and 
independence 
its a grand day sir and its a grand old flag conductor 
jerold ottley told bush whereupon choir members sporting yellow 
plaid scarves broke into a spirited version of its a grand old 
flag 
like any firemens parade in towns across america bushs 
inaugural procession had a stream of high school bands flags baton 
twirlers and antique cars 
but unlike most local parades this one also had the ohio state 
marching band the budweiser clydesdales and the presidents own 
marine corps band all in the same line 
the two grand marshals comedian bob hope and test pilot chuck 
yeager rode to the white house on the lead flag float and 
joined the bushes in the front row of the reviewing stand 
the presidents son george bush jr donned a white tengallon 
hat when the texas float followed by the university of texas 
longhorn band arrived on the scene 
the line of march also included a band from yale the presidents 
alma mater and another from depauw university the indiana college 
that quayle attended 
mrs quayles alma mater purdue was represented by a marching 
band that boasted the worlds largest drum 
an obviously delighted president stood up and waved as a navy tbm 
avenger torpedo bomber a duplicate of the plane he piloted during 
world war ii went by on a float 
bush and quayle shared a joke as the boston patrolmens 
association inc the first police union to endorse the gop 
presidential ticket last fall filed by along with a large float 
representing bostons finest 
the endorsement was particularly embarrassing for michael 
dukakis bushs democratic challenger from massachusetts 
during the parade bush dangled grandchildren on his knee 
greeted cabinet officers and chatted with his children across the 
aisle the quayles sat alone speaking only infrequently with the 
bushes or others on the platform 
arriving on the platform mrs quayle greeted bush with a kiss 
then quickly froze to attention after noticing that a color guard 
was passing by 
each time a flag appeared mrs quayle stood up and placed her 
hand over her heart

democratic lawmakers welcomed george bushs 
inaugural speech as a sign that the new republican president will 
have better relations with congress than ronald reagan did but they 
also said it offered too few specifics 
i think were off on a good foot said rep john conyers 
dmich this has genuinely established a kind of bipartisanship 
and friendship that should go beyond inaugural speeches 
ive been very touched by the things hes said in the last 
several days said rep john lewis dga its better than what 
weve had in the past eight years 
it was a very sensitive speech said rep dan glickman 
dkan in style its a dramatic break from ronald reagan it was 
humane and it showed a recognition that the democrats control both 
houses of congress 
he said bushs suggestion in his 20minute address that the 
federal governments money needs be reallocated clearly implied a 
shift from reagans emphasis on military spending to domestic 
priorities 
he repeated the themes hes been stating since the election 
cooperation and conciliation said house majority leader thomas 
foley dwash it is all very well received and congress will 
respond with an equal effort and attitude 
bush is extending the hand of friendship and we intend to 
extend ours in return said senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine 
mitchell said he planned to make a speech in response on 
wednesday when the senate reconvenes setting forth some of our 
objectives for this congress he said he had discussed his plans 
for the response with house speaker jim wright dtexas and senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan

normalcy in the white house how delighted i am

united states on friday was a soviet rocket body launched in 
december and reentering the atmosphere authorities said 
the rocket was sighted in texas oklahoma louisiana arkansas 
missouri illinois kentucky mississippi and iowa and a number of 
witnesses called officials to say they had seen it blaze across the 
sky about 810 pm cst 
some witnesses said the fireball had fiery tail 30 to 40 miles 
long 
maj dick adams a spokesman for the north american air defense 
command in colorado springs colo said the us space command 
identified the object as a sovietbuilt rocket body that was 
launched sometime last year 
it came down about 9 pm est adams said there is no way 
to know as to what happened to it 
the space command tracks about 7100 manmade objects and once 
they start to notice an object falling out of orbit they try to 
predict its reentry adams said 
adams said the object would not be positively identified until 
saturday 
earlier in the evening before the rocket body was tentatively 
identified navy cmdr dugald gillies deputy director of public 
affairs for the us space command said the space surveillance 
center was monitoring the object 
weve gotten many calls as well gillies said to the best 
of our estimation it would be a reentering of a soviet rocket body 
from a launch that took place last year 
thats as much detail as we have it was one of the objects 
that we track this reentry correlates with what we were tracking 
he said the sightings were made better because of weather that 
was clear and perfect for such sightings 
a dispatcher at the oklahoma highway patrol said the office had 
received calls from all over the state altus enid pawnee 
muskogee you name it theyve seen it she said were not 
sure yet what it was 
the federal aviation administration national weather service and 
military bureaus and bases across the midwest and southwest were 
swamped with calls from the curious officials said 
it just appeared all of a sudden out of the south and fell 
straight due north and it left a line just as straight as could 
be robin england of abilene texas told the abilene 
reporternews 
ms england said the rocket was in the sky for about three 
minutes slowly streaking across the sky 
sgt ron lenzini of the macon mo division of the missouri 
state highway patrol said the display was spectacular 
i went to the front door about 810 pm and saw what looked 
like a cluster of five pieces of some kind of burning debris in the 
sky lenzini said 
it had the effect of fourth of july or roman candles trailing 
fire behind it he said

condemned killer ted bundy began confessing 
to the murders of about 30 young women in five western states a 
newspaper reported saturday 
volusia state attorney john tanner a personal friend of bundy 
told the orlando sentinel friday night that he learned of the 
confessions from law enforcement agents at florida state prison near 
starke 
its my information that murders are being solved tanner 
said this is coming from law enforcement officers who are 
participating in these meetings the information they are giving me 
is that he is giving them verifiable hard facts concerning unsolved 
murders 
tanner would not identify the officers who spoke to him but said 
bundy met friday with robert keppel of the washington state attorney 
generals office and bill hagmaier of the fbi behavioral sciences 
unit in quantico va 
bundy who faces execution tuesday in the slaying of a 
12yearold lake city girl is scheduled to meet this weekend with 
authorities from colorado utah and idaho 
tanner and his wife met with the killer for about two hours 
friday morning before the law enforcement meetings began 
police have mentioned bundy as a suspect in as many as three 
dozen slayings in the early and mid1970s in washington state 
idaho oregon utah and colorado the victims were young women 
between the ages of 16 and 26 many were never found 
bundy has frequently met with investigators and reporters over 
the past 11 years but has refused to talk specifically about any of 
the cases 
bundy facing the electric chair for the 1978 murder of kimberly 
leach has tried to trade information about the unsolved murders for 
a delay in his execution but gov bob martinez rejected the offer 
tanner has been meeting regularly with bundy for about two years 
he said the killer told him about a year ago that he wanted to 
confess to everything hed done 
tanner a defense attorney before being elected in november said 
they specifically did not discuss details of any of the cases 
because he is a lawyer 
i know people wont necessarily accept this but bundy says 
its the right thing to do the attorney said people think hes

condemned murderer ted bundy began 
confessing to the murders of about 30 young women in five western 
states friday a newspaper reported and the florida supreme refused 
to block his execution 
the 42yearold former law student is slated to die in the 
electric chair tuesday for the murder of a 12yearold lake city 
girl 
volusia state attorney john tanner a personal friend of bundy 
told the orlando sentinel friday night that he learned of the 
confessions from law enforcement agents at florida state prison near 
starke the newspaper said saturday 
its my information that murders are being solved tanner 
said this is coming from law enforcement officers who are 
participating in these meetings the information they are giving me 
is that he is giving them verifiable hard facts concerning unsolved 
murders 
tanner would not identify the officers who spoke to him but said 
bundy met with robert keppel of the washington state attorney 
generals office and bill hagmaier of the fbi behavioral sciences 
unit in quantico va 
bundy is scheduled to meet this weekend with authorities from 
colorado utah and idaho 
the supreme court meanwhile said it didnt want to hear from 
bundy again 
defense attorney james coleman was expected to take his appeal to 
us district court in orlando for a hearing on saturday morning 
the high court rejected three claims from bundy and said his 
attempt to again raise the issue of mental competency constituted an 
abuse of process 
the supreme court said the issue had not been raised in a timely 
fashion should have been raised at an earlier stage and had already 
been settled in an case in which bundy was convicted of murdering 
two sorority sisters 
the court also said no petition for rehearing will be permitted 
the question really was was he able to assist his lawyers 
said coleman who sought to stop the execution to determine whether 
bundy was competent during his trial for the murder of kimberly 
diane leach a lake city schoolgirl 
bundy served as his own attorney through much of that trial 
much of what he did even at the hearing undermined his 
defense and his lawyers were having problems controlling him 
getting him to make decisions having problems getting him to stick 
to decisions said coleman 
attorney general bob butterworth said after the hearing that 
bundys attorneys were grasping at a straw 
all the courts have found ted bundy to be competent said 
butterworth 
the appeal centered on allegations that bundys competence to 
stand trial wasnt adequately reviewed in either the leach case or 
an earlier conviction in the 1978 slayings of sorority sisters at 
florida state university 
they also claimed the judge at the leach trial improperly 
discussed the case with prosecutors without defense attorneys 
present 
those claims were rejected by the supreme court which said they 
were not raised in timely fashion in accordance with rules of 
procedure 
bundy is under his fourth death warrant gov bob martinez signed 
the most recent warrant tuesday after the us supreme court 
declined to hear the case 
bundys last stay of execution was in 1986 six hours before he 
was to go to the electric chair

fires set by inmates erupted friday night in a 
prison south of washington and authorities said an unknown number of 
inmates were free within the sprawling complex one inmate was 
killed and one was injured authorities said 
at least four fires were set in the lorton reformatory complex 
according to authorities the administration building of the central 
facility was destroyed by the flames according to officials at the 
mayors command center 
district of columbia mayor marion barry accompanied by his wife 
effi both dressed in formal clothes they wore to friday nights 
inaugural balls arrived early today for a briefing 
the fires were at the corrections complex which is operated by 
the district and located about 20 miles south of the city the 
mediumsecurity complex houses about 1280 inmates from the district 
in dormitories and has been the scene of numerous inmate protests 
because of overcrowded conditions 
pat wheeler a spokeswoman for the city corrections department 
said one inmate was killed in the outbreak and another was injured 
no details about the circumstances of those casualties were 
immediately available 
ms wheeler said all inmates had been accounted for and none had 
escaped from the complex 
firefighters remained outside for about an hour while city 
corrections officers herded inmates who had been loose in the 
complex onto a baseball field 
lt mike reilly of the fairfax county va fire department said 
firemen did not try to put out the fires until it was certain the 
situation was safe until we get an area that is confirmed secure 
we are keeping our firefighters out he said 
it was not clear how many buildings were on fire in the sprawling 
complex which sits in a wooded rolling area near the potomac 
river one official said four buildings had fires but there were 
other reports that only two buildings were aflame 
washington police were rushed to the area including officers who 
had been assigned to protection duties at inaugural balls around the 
city the galas were celebrating the inauguration of president bush 
earlier friday 
the fire did not disrupt bushs schedule as he made the rounds of 
inaugural events but six police cars their sirens wailing sped by 
on their way to the prison just as the presidents motorcade pulled 
up to a private dinner at the organization of american states 
building near the white house 
the incident began with a power failure about 915 pm at the 
prisons central facility 
with the lights out fires were set by inmates in the building 
said ms wheeler 
we have no idea what specifically is going on inside the 
central facility she said in answer to a question about the 
location of inmates 
inmates were herded into a nearby baseball field where they were 
being guarded by police ms wheeler said 
the fires continued to burn several hours after the first alarm 
was sounded 
early today dc fire units arrived to aid fairfax firefighters 
fbi agents also went to the prison said ms wheeler the fbi 
investigates crimes at the complex 
a district police helicopter hovered overhead and some inmates 
were running loose in an open area within the prison complex 
the chronically overcrowded prison complex made up of a series 
of smaller prisons held a total of 6165 inmates last month when 
the district government asked a federal judge to bar newly sentenced 
felons from the entering city institutions 
the city closed its doors to new inmates for six weeks last fall 
opening them again only under a federal judges order the federal 
government was forced to take charge of 300 city inmates during that 
time 
the district has also sent more than 200 inmates to the states of 
washington and tennessee 
rep stan parris rva responding to the violence and frequent 
escapes from the facility introduced legislation in congress last 
fall to give virginia some control over the prison complex at the 
time he said the situation at lorton reached crisis proportions 
a decade ago and it has continued to deteriorate 
although there have been isolated incidents at the complex 
friday nights outbreak was the largest since an inmate riot broke 
out in july 1986 at the occoquan i and ii facilities two sections 
within the lorton institution one inmate was killed by buckshot 
wounds to the head suffered when guards tried to quell the uprising 
twentynine inmates nine guards and three firefighters were 
injured in that riot the fiery outbreak damaged 13 buildings and 
many inmates were kept in temporary shelters for a time afterwards 
edward koren an attorney with the national prison project of the 
american civil liberties union foundation said this is not 
anything new we have a long sad history of overcrowding at these 
facilities inevitably there are disturbances 
its really a very dangerous place they claim it is medium 
security but really its used for long timers its really just a 
dormitory theres a lot of violence a lot of idlness conditions 
are poor and thats a real dangerous mix 
the district has been unable to build new facilities at the 
complex because of political opposition from fairfax county 
officials who oppose the presence of the district prison and hold 
more power than the city in congress

president bush called himself a lousy 
dancer but gamely took a few whirls with his wife during an 
exultant tour of inaugural balls where 60000 republican stalwarts 
toasted his swearingin and caroused into the wee hours today 
during the gaudy noisy and slightly wacky evening bush also 
bragged about his fantastic new living quarters at the white 
house and vice president dan quayle had one hotel ballroom throng 
erupting in laughter with an offhand remark with a double meaning 
bushs choice for secretary of state james a baker iii 
sashayed with fellow texans beneath the wright brothers plane at 
the national air and space museum where crystal gayle sang her 
country best 
it was so crowded and the air so heavy in the redcarpeted grand 
foyer of the kennedy center that several blacktie guests fainted in 
front of the stage one woman who lost consciousness was kept from 
sagging to the floor by the crush of more than 5000 people around 
her 
presidential son marvin bush introduced his wife who wore a 
fulllength blue velvet gown and told several thousand partygoers 
at the washington convention center i paid a lot for this dress 
and damn it i wanted you to see it 
one of the belles of the ball at another hotel was 7yearold 
jessica cartonia the current little miss buffalo her mother 
sharon proudly confided that jessica was conceived in the same 
hotel during president reagans first inauguration in 1981 when 
we thought we were never going to have children 
outside one of the 11 invitationonly inaugural balls animal 
rights protesters shouted fur is murder and im warm im not 
wearing fur at arriving guests many of whom wore fur coats in the 
chill wind 
the bass player for the bus boys rock band at a 30ahead youth 
ball stood up and shouted its the inaugural day for a brandnew 
getdown president 
during his hurried ballhopping tour from union station near the 
capitol to the kennedy center on the banks of the moonlit potomac 
river the new president made it laughingly clear that hes not very 
fond of dancing 
each time the band struck up i could have danced all night 
bush took his wife barbara out for a brief cheektocheek turn on 
the floor he took a few steps of an oldfashioned fox trot and no 
more 
he told the crowd at union station that you can say that you 
saw it first here a lousy dancer trying to dance his first dance 
with the first lady of the united states of america 
later at the sprawling pension building he quipped the bush 
family is going to give dancing a bad name after taking a few 
steps with mrs bush he stopped abruptly and announced thats 
it thats the only step i know 
at the washington convention center which rocked to the music of 
his old friend lionel hampton the president pleaded with the crowd 
to overlook his footwork i hope you dont judge my being a 
president by the way i dance he said 
quayle told revelers at a hotel ballroom that he feels the same 
way about dancing as his new boss i guess protocol allows you to 
witness my inability to dance he said taking his wife marilyn 
onto the floor for a few stiff turns 
at another hotel quayle appeared with his wife and recalling 
their departure from the oathtaking ceremony at the capitol 
remarked that we went behind the bushes the crowd erupted in 
laughter at the doubleentendre 
johnny carson could not do it better the vice president said 
with a grin 
bush seemed elated by his new home at 1600 pennsylvania avenue 
dont worry about our housing he told one ballroom assembly 
we were over at the white house for two hours and boy is it 
something special unbelievable 
at his first stop an american legion affair for 149 medal of 
honor winners and other military heroes the president vowed to keep 
america strong by the time he reached the omni shoreham for his 
12th visit bushs energy was flagging 
where do you get all that life from he asked the cheering 
throng 
at his 15th and final stop on the party circuit standing in the 
washington hilton hotel ballroom at 1230 am a hoarse bush seemed 
in a reflective mood as he recalled his emotions when he took the 
oath of office at the west front of the capitol at midday friday 
i did feel moved standing there today and looking across that 
sea of faces he said thinking of the continuity of the 
presidency thinking of my gratitude to my predecessor thinking of 
the joy that i have and the strength that i get from my family 
thinking of how lucky we are to be a nation under god and thinking 
how lucky i am to have friends like you 
with that he departed in his limousine fifteen minutes later 
he arrived home for his first night in the white house

congratulations as he took office with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev hoping he would bring peace and pope john paul ii wishing 
him an abundance of divine blessings

middle east

us government and another the downtoearth bush over reagan 
the romantic a british daily said bush would need some of 
reagans luck

panamanians shot off fireworks in panama city and nicaraguans danced 
in the streets of managua to celebrate his departure 
gorbachev told bush he hoped his term would bring stable and 
diverse development of relations between our countries and said 
moscow was ready to work in that direction the official news agency 
tass said 
gorbachev said further joint efforts by the soviet union and 
the united states will make it possible to substantially bring 
closer the solution of the most painful problems of the present 
time above all the need to eliminate the threat of war 
prime minister margaret thatcher sent bush a congratulatory 
message as did west german chancellor helmut kohl president 
francois mitterrand of france and other european leaders in vatican

1981 one float friday showed uncle sam throwing dollars and the

announced that it would begin issuing visas for us officials 
nicaragua imposed visa restrictions after each country expelled 
eight of the others diplomats including the ambassadors during a 
diplomatic tiff in july 
in the middle east israeli and arab commentators appeared to 
agree that the changeover from reagan to bush was israels loss and 
the arabs gain 
in jeruslaem the daily hadashot said israel must be prepared for 
bush to be less sensitive and more pragmatic in approaching the 
arabisrael conflict 
president hosni mubarak of egypt said he believed bush 
understands the palestinian problem and has good intentions 
according to an interview with the kuwait daily alrai alaam 
bassam abu sharif spokesman for plo chief yasser arafat and 
other officials of the palestine liberation organization expressed 
cautious optimism that their cause may fare better with bush 
the pros are back said the conservative la libre belgique in 
brussels but added they were a network of serious patricians who 
risk being boring 
in paris the leftist newspaper le monde asked after the 
great communicator the great corrector 
bushs big challenge will be peace of which mr gorbachev made 
himself the champion the paper said 
the centerleft het parool of amsterdam said bushs presidency 
will be less flamboyant than that of reagan but better than 
reagan the romantic the downtoearth bush may be expected to draw 
the line between dream and reality and that holds no small 
promise 
the financial times anticipated a preference for management and 
a recognition of interdependence but added bush would need luck 
a commodity that mr reagan had in abundance but cannot bequeath

vice president dan quayle danced gamely into 
his second day on the job partying with wife marilyn until well 
past midnight and facing down a heckler in the only moment of 
discord on a night of celebration 
the quayles stopped at 14 inaugural balls and parties over more 
than four and a half hours friday night after being sworn in as the 
44th vice president it was after 1 am before they headed to the 
vice presidents residence for their first nights sleep in their 
new home 
at the american legions salute to heroes banquet quayle 
was interrupted by a shout from the audience just as he was speaking 
of freedom as the most precious thing we have 
what do you know about it shouted a woman who appeared to be 
a guest but could not be identified 
pausing only briefly quayle said freedom people have the 
freedom to speak we have free speech in this country 
he received a long and loud applause from the crowd made up 
largely of war veterans including 149 of the 225 living recipients 
of the congressional medal of honor the nations highest military 
honor 
quayle savored the sound of his new title at several stops after 
praising bush at length he said as a matter of fact vice 
president dan quayle doesnt sound too shabby 
quayle danced with his wife briefly at each of the balls on their 
motorcade tour of the city he told reporters before stepping out 
for the evening that his wife says he is a terrible dancer and 
he pledged to keep it to a minimum 
he did little to dispel that judgment and the dances were brief 
at the lavish ball in newly restored union station he danced with 
his mother and at several other stops he and marilyn danced with 
guests selected from the audience after first dancing with each 
other 
but as the night wore on both appeared weary and by midnight he 
had lost track of how many parties they had been to 
ask the press said marilyn quayle he did 
the press says its the 11th ball the vice president 
announced theyre usually wrong so for the record its either 
10 or 12

greeted warmly one woman on the front row 24yearold cindy butler 
of atlanta yelled to him dan blow me a kiss and take your 
coat off dan 
at another stop he told of his unease at the new protocol that 
put him ahead of former president reagan upon leaving the inaugural 
ceremony he said he and marilyn went out behind the bushes and 
then paused to consider what hed said 
mrs quayle put her hand to her face in embarrassment 
the crowd roared 
johnny carson could do no better quayle said finally

actresses and pop stars modeled tshirts to support 
a retail venture in the campaign against furs while a halfdozen 
furriers protested outside the shop 
actresses julie christie rita tushingham and twiggy chrissie 
hynde of the pretenders and siouxsie of the group siouxsie and the 
banshees on friday donned tshirts designed by the animal rights 
group lynx 
the 3yearold group has opened a store in covent garden making 
its case by selling tshirts bearing slogans like yuck your 
disgusting fur coat 
i modeled a fur coat when i was 16 that is the first and last 
time i have ever worn one said twiggy wearing a fur coat is 
absolutely unnecessary absolutely disgusting and complete vanity 
we have got to stop women wanting them so there would be no point 
selling them 
some of the protesting furriers handed out leaflets with a 
distorted lynx logo which they had embellished with horns and forked 
tongue 
lynxs stated purpose is to destroy the fur trade said 
mihran allalemdjian who buys and sells skins there is a question

a tough iranian crackdown on drug 
traffickers takes effect today with a mandatory death penalty for 
anyone found with small amounts of narcotics 
at least 75 smugglers already have been executed this month in 
the fiercest crackdown since the early days of the islamic 
revolution when hundreds of alleged drug users and pushers were 
rounded up and killed 
the new campaign followed the aug 20 ceasefire in the iraniraq 
war and an alarming surge in drug abuse blamed on hardships caused 
by the 8year conflict worsening unemployment and irans religious 
ban on alcohol 
the laws mandate death for people convicted of possessing 30 
grams or just over an ounce of heroin codeine or morphine or 
smuggling 11 pounds of opium or hashish simple possession of opium 
or hashish carries a jail term 
we have no fear of increasing statistics on executions because 
those who become the victims of the traders of death are far greater 
in number than the smugglers said mohammadmousavi khoeiniha 
irans prosecutorgeneral on tehran radio 
official figures on drug abuse in iran are not available but 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani recently indicated the scale 
of the crisis by referring to the devastating problem of drug 
abuse a blight that has ruined some of our young people 
the problem is a political one said irans chief 
justice ayatollah musavi ardebili the superpowers just as they 
fought the islamic revolution on the battlefield and in the economic 
field use narcotics as one method to battle with the people 
and taint the revolution 
even before the new law came into force iranian authorities had 
rounded up more than 1000 suspected smugglers and pushers running 
them through islamic tribunals and hanging them as soon as they were 
found guilty 
on jan 7 19 smugglers were hanged or shot by firing squads 
tehrans radical jomhuri islami daily hailed the executions as 
a landmark on the path to eradicating narcotics 
nine days later irans official media said 56 were executed in 
one day in various cities a chilling display of tehrans 
determination to eliminate drugs 
jomhuri islami urged that authorities put an end to the 
disgraceful life of a few who take joy in ruining a nation only to 
fill their pockets 
its much better if some families lose their breadwinners in 
this way than a nation loses its youth 
the new law was announced dec 5 by the 13member expediency 
council a body with special powers set up in february by ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini to speed legislation snarled in parliament 
apart from the death sentences the law provides for a minimum 
20year prison term for anyone convicted of addicting another person 
to drugs those convicted of causing widespread addiction could also 
face death 
the expediency council gave drug addicts six months to kick their 
habits or face imprisonment 
mokhtar kalantari deputy commander of the islamic revolutionary 
committees which have largely taken over law enforcement from 
police acknowledged shortcomings in recent years in combatting the 
narcotics trade from neighboring afghanistan and pakistan while iran 
concentrated on the war with iraq there are extensive poppy fields 
in iran as well 
officials say large quantities of narcotics are smuggled through 
iran into turkey and the soviet union 
former president abolhassan banisadr in exile in france 
claimed in a recent new york times interview that the tehran 
government is involved in the drug trade to make ends meet 
earning 2 billion a year from it 
kalantari predicted with the new laws that authorities will 
eliminate 80 percent of the narcotics trade within two years

plan for poor black neighborhoods in the wake of riots as the city 
geared up for the super bowl with fanfare fireworks and fiestas 
law enforcement officials meanwhile prepared for the funeral 
today of one of two black men whose deaths in a police shooting 
monday triggered the riots 
suarez discussed the plan in a meeting friday with black leaders 
as the black neighborhoods shaken by three days of violence returned 
to normality 
we know that a little bit of anger can have good results and 
we hope to turn what was more than a little bit of anger expressed 
in our community into many many good results he told them 
the city refused to let one of its worst weeks completely spoil 
the prelude to one of its biggest events the super bowl this sunday 
frank sinatra liza minnelli and sammy davis performed friday 
night at the miami arena on the edge of overtown the predominantly 
black neighborhood where the riots began another performance was 
booked for tonight 
in nearby miami beach 3000 people attended a bash held by 
national football league commissioner pete rozelle at the stephen 
muss convention center 
fireworks burst over biscayne bay as thousands of excited 
partiers listened to salsa and jazz bands at a shopping center and 
park less than a mile from where the shooting occurred 
a panel formed to investigate the shooting met for the first time 
friday 
im hoping well begin to deal seriously with this communitys 
problems and do more than just put some iodine on its cancers 
said the rev richard berry chairman of the 11member committee of 
police officers and black residents 
an unarmed motorcyclist 23yearold clement lloyd was shot in 
the head by a hispanic policeman monday as he sped through overtown 
lloyds passenger allen blanchard died of injuries from the 
subsequent crash 
the rioting that followed left one man dead and 11 others were 
treated for gunshot wounds thirteen buildings were torched others 
were looted and 372 people were arrested in overtown and the 
predominantly black liberty city neighborhood authorities said 
about 150 of those arrested remained in jail unable to post 
bond said police sgt michael mazur authorities planned to keep 
them locked up until new arraignments monday when if they plead 
guilty they will released based on time served 
blanchard was to be buried this afternoon officials said they 
were concerned about the potential for trouble at the funeral 
primarily because of the involvement of the rev al sharpton who 
has led protests by blacks in new york city and in atlanta 
the major concern is that sharpton will cause problems said 
mazur we dont need someone pouring gasoline on the situation 
black leaders have said sharpton is unwelcome but he was 
scheduled to hold a news conference and rally anyway 
security concerns also focused on the super bowl three hundred 
metrodade police officers in uniform and plainclothes will guard 
joe robbie stadium said police spokesman jim hutton 
only people with tickets will be allowed past the parking gates 
if protesters show up and obstruct the entrance they will be moved 
out quickly hutton said 
suarez called his program miamis comeback plan aimed at 
giving an economic boost to black areas and improving 
policecommunity relations 
the plan includes special tax districts business and job 
creation programs and police sensitivity and screening efforts he 
said that it was only a partial solution and some of the programs 
may fail 
the mayor did not set a cost for his plan nor did he say how it 
would be financed but city manager cesar odio said city resources 
for helping impoverished sections were slim 
were almost taxed out odio said theres no more we can 
do with taxes 
black leaders gathered 200 residents and high school students at 
a community center for a previously scheduled workshop on 
nonviolent conflict resolution and the teachings of the rev martin 
luther king jr they said they hoped the session at which suarez 
also appeared would help calm tensions 
yolanda king daughter of the slain civil rights leader said her 
father would not have advocated violence but would have been 
heartened that the needs of the community were receiving attention 
because of the unrest

jacqueline kennedy onassis is fighting a legal 
battle with wampanoag indians over a strip of beach on chic marthas 
vineyard that they consider sacred 
the indians portray mrs onassis as a rich newcomer intent on 
grabbing their tribal lands to round out her private summer retreat 
on the resort island off cape cod 
but her new york city lawyer alexander d forger says the 
former first lady has tried to deal fairly with the indians 
offering to swap better land or buy the beach for a fair price 
the indians descendants of the islands original inhabitants 
seem to be trying to take advantage of her wealth and the publicity 
her name can generate he added 
because the interested party is mrs onassis it seems evident 
that they believe thay can obtain five times what the property is 
worth forger said friday 
mrs onassis real estate trust is suing for partition of the 
15acre stretch of pristine dunes a legal maneuver that could 
result in the property being put up for sale to the highest bidder 
a pretrial conference was held earlier this week at the dukes 
county probate court in edgartown the original motion was filed 
aug 12 1980 but the lawsuit lay dormant for years 
paul j sulla a boston lawyer representing about a dozen of the 
indians said little doubt exists about who the high bidder would be 
most of my clients have little or no money and there is no way 
they can compete with jackie he said 
mrs onassis trust already has a oneseventh interest in the 
land the remaining shares are owned by more than 25 wampanoag 
indians 
mrs onassis wants to buy out the indians and gain sole ownership 
of the 264footlong stretch of beach because she owns all the land 
around it a 400acre tract that includes her summer home and guest 
house forger said 
the property in the town of gay head is rapidly being eroded 
by the atlantic and is expected not to exist in another 10 years 
he said 
mrs onassis offered to swap a larger beachfront property that is 
not subject to erosion and has better access but the indians 
declined forger said 
sulla said the indians are willing to respect mrs onassis 
privacy but would like her to allow them to swim and pick wild 
berries on the beach as they have for generations 
jackies property completely surrounds the indians land and 
she has guards at both ends of her beach to keep everyone away 
sulla said but this area is very sacred to the wampanoags this 
is where their great chief resides in legend they say he smokes his 
pipe and thats where the fog comes from 
mrs onassiss trust bought the 400 acres on marthas vineyard in 
the mid1970s and has brought a series of court actions to try to 
clear title to the land titles in gay head are often unclear 
because the town was divided into a checkerboard pattern in the 
1870s and many lots have no legal access 
joan patadal a tribal member whose family has a small share in 
the land said the property is the only piece of beach indians still 
own in gay head most of the wampanoag tribal lands have gradually 
been lost or sold and the indians intend to preserve what theyve 
got left she said 
nobody wants to sell tickets for people to see jackie mrs 
patadal said were not interested in that we just want to be 
able to get to our beach

the foreign minister of portugal has had 
his knuckles rapped for what is usually considered an essential 
skill in modern diplomacy speaking english 
newspapers and politicians have harshly criticized joao de deus 
pinheiro ever since he spoke english earlier this month at an 
international conference on chemical weapons in paris 
critics say it breaks a pledge by the seven portuguesespeaking 
nations to promote their language the sixth most widely spoken in 
the world at international events 
more importantly they charge pinheiro hurt portugal at a time 
when its influence among former colonies is increasingly being 
challenged by one of them brazil 
no speak portuguese was the motto plastered across the 
tshirt of a cartoon of deus pinheiro on the cover of the satirical 
rightwing weekly o diabo 
another paper this week showed the stocky bearded minister 
introducing himself as god pine the direct english translation 
of his name 
while deus pinheiro has been busy drumming up international 
financial support for an economic recovery plan for the other major 
portuguesespeaking countries of angola and mozambique brazil has 
outflanked portugal on trade and relief efforts 
trade between angola and brazil has quadrupled the last three 
years to more than 1 billion 
portugals trade with angola dropped from about 165 million in 
1986 to 127 million in 1987 for the first eight months of 1988 
the countries did about 103 million in business 
deus pinheiros recovery plan foresees 600 million dollars worth 
of aid from several nations to angola but brazil has already 
granted luanda a 11 billion credit that the african nation repays 
in oil it produces 
according to one government official in brasilia next weeks 
planned visit by president jose sarney to angola the first ever by 
a brazilian head of state should increase cooperation between the 
countries 
brazil already sells food cars and farm machinery to the 
southern african nation and is helping to build a hydroelectric dam 
there brazilian companies are now showing interest in helping 
rebuild angolas ravaged telephone and power networks 
we think portugal made an error at the paris conference 
said mozambiques secretary of state for foreign affairs antonio 
materrula we have to push our mutual language at an international 
level 
portuguese is not an official language of the united nations but 
the countries that use it angola brazil cape verde 
guineabissau mozambique portugal and sao tome e principe count 
about 180 million inhabitants 
only mandarin chinese hindi english spanish and russian are 
spoken by more people worldwide 
brazilian and mozambican delegates at the chemical weapons 
conference spoke in portuguese further enraging portugals 
politicians scholars and journalists 
its a scandalous insult to the values and interests of our 
language said herminio martinho leader of portugals new 
democratic party 
the importance of this language should be turned into a 
diplomatic tool and we portugal dont have many others said 
jorge sampaio newly elected leader of portugals main opposition 
socialist party

kings we only have to summon it from within ourselves

we must act on what we know i take as my guide the hope of a 
saint in crucial things unity in important things diversity in 
all things generosity 
america today is a proud free nation decent and civil a place 
we cannot help but love we know in our hearts not loudly and 
proudly but as a simple fact that this country has meaning beyond 
what we see and that our strength is a force for good 
but have we changed as nation even in our time are we 
enthralled with material things less appreciative of the nobility 
of work and sacrifice 
my friends we are not the sum of our possessions they are not 
the measure of our lives in our hearts we know what matters we 
cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car a bigger bank 
account we must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a 
loyal friend a loving parent a citizen who leaves his home his 
neighborhood and town better than he found it 
and what do we want the men and women who work with us to say 
when were no longer there that we were more driven to succeed than 
anyone around us or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had 
gotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of 
friendship 
no president no government can teach us to remember what is 
best in what we are but if the man you have chosen to lead this 
government can help make a difference if he can celebrate the 
quieter deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk but of 
better hearts and finer souls if he can do these things then he 
must 
america is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high 
moral principle we as a people have such a purpose today it is to 
make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world 
my friends we have work to do there are the homeless lost and 
roaming there are the children who have nothing no love no 
normalcy there are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement 
to whatever addiction drugs welfare demoralization that rules 
the slums there is crime to be conquered the rough crime of the 
streets there are young women to be helped who are about to become 
mothers of children they cant care for and might not love they 
need our care our guidance and education though we bless them for 
choosing life 
the old solution the old way was to think that public money 
alone could end these problems but we have learned that that is not 
so and in any case our funds are low we have a deficit to bring 
down we have more will than wallet but will is what we need 
we will make the hard choices looking at what we have perhaps 
allocating it differently making our decisions based on honest need 
and prudent safety 
and then we will do the wisest thing of all we will turn to the 
only resource we have that in times of need always grows the 
goodness and the courage of the american people

and i am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others a 
new activism handson and involved that gets the job done we must 
bring in the generations harnessing the unused talent of the 
elderly and the unfocused energy of the young for not only 
leadership is passed from generation to generation but so is 
stewardship and the generation born after the second world war has 
come of age 
i have spoken of a thousand points of light of all the 
community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the 
nation doing good 
we will work hand in hand encouraging sometimes leading 
sometimes being led rewarding we will work on this in the white 
house in the cabinet agencies i will go to the people and the 
programs that are the brighter points of light and ill ask every 
member of my government to become involved 
the old ideas are new again because theyre not old they are 
timeless duty sacrifice commitment and a patriotism that finds 
its expression in taking part and pitching in 
and we need a new engagement too between the executive and the 
congress 
the challenges before us will be thrashed out with the house and 
senate and we must bring the federal budget into balance and we 
must ensure that america stands before the world united strong at 
peace and fiscally sound but of course things may be difficult 
we need compromise we have had dissension we need harmony we 
have had a chorus of discordant voices 
for congress too has changed in our time there has grown a 
certain divisiveness we have seen the hard looks and heard the 
statements in which not each others ideas are challenged but each 
others motives 
and our great parties have two often been far apart and 
untrusting of each other 
its been this way since vietnam that war cleaves us still but 
friends that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago and 
surely the statute of limitations has been reached this is a fact 
the final lesson of vietnam is that no great nation can long afford 
to be sundered by a memory 
a new breeze is blowing and the old bipartisanship must be made 
new again 
to my friends and yes i do mean friends in the loyal 
opposition and yes i mean loyal i put out my hand 
i am putting out my hand to you mr speaker 
i am putting out my hand to you mr majority leader 
for this is the thing this is the age of the offered hand 
and we cant turn back clocks and i dont want to but when our 
fathers were young mr speaker our differences ended at the 
waters edge and we dont wish to turn back time but when our 
mothers were young mr majority leader the congress and the 
executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on 
which this nation could live

let us negotiate soon and hard but in the end let us produce 
the american people await action they didnt send us here to 
bicker they ask us to rise above the merely partisan in crucial 
things unity and this my friends is crucial 
to the world too we offer new engagement and a renewed vow we 
will stay strong to protect the peace the offered hand is a 
reluctant fist once made strong and can be used with great effect 
there are today americans who are held against their will in 
foreign lands and americans who are unaccounted for assistance can 
be shown here and will be long remembered good will begets good 
will good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on 
great nations like great men must keep their word when 
america says something america means it whether a treaty or an 
agreement or a vow made on marble steps we will always try to speak 
clearly for candor is a compliment but subtlety too is good and 
has its place 
while keeping our alliances and friendships around the world 
strong ever strong we will continue the new closeness with the 
soviet union consistent both with our security and with progress 
one might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumph 
of hope and strength over experience but hope is good and so is 
strength and vigilance 
here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the 
understandable satisfaction of those who have taken part in 
democracy and seen their hopes fulfilled 
but my thoughts have been turning the past few days to those who 
would be watching at home 
to an older fellow who will throw a salute by himself when the 
flag goes by and the women who will tell her sons the words of the 
battle hymns i do not mean this to be sentimental i mean that on 
days like this we remember that we are all part of a continuum 
inescapably connected by the ties that bind 
our children are watching in schools throughout our great land 
and to them i say thank you for watching democracys big day for 
democracy belongs to us all and freedom is like a beautiful kite 
that can go higher and higher with the breeze

and to all i say no matter what your circumstances or where you 
are you are part of this day you are part of the life of our great 
nation 
a president is neither prince nor pope and i dont seek a 
window on mens souls in fact i yearn for a greater tolerance 
an easygoingness about each others attitudes and way of life 
there are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up 
united and express our intolerance and the most obvious now is 
drugs and when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship it may 
as well have been a deadly bacteria so much has it hurt the body 
the soul of our country and there is much to be done and to be 
said but take my word for it this scourge will stop 
and so there is much to do and tomorrow the work begins 
and i do not mistrust the future i do not fear what is ahead 
for our problems are large but our heart is larger our challenges 
are great but our will is greater and if our flaws are endless 
gods love is truly boundless 
some see leadership as high drama and the sound of trumpets 
calling and sometimes it is that but i see history as a book with 
many pages and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness 
and meaning 
the new breeze blows a page turns the story unfolds and so 
today a chapter begins a small and stately story of unity 
diversity and generosity shared and written together 
thank you 
god bless you and god bless the united states of america

a transient grabbed a policemans gun 
shot him to death and mortally wounded another officer before police 
killed the man in a 30second fusillade as a terrified student 
television crew recorded the violence 
the homeless man identified as dale randy connors 35 was being 
questioned by officer gene simpson 45 in front of a downtown 
doughnut shop when a scuffle broke out around noon friday police 
and witnesses said 
among the estimated 30 witnesses were santa clara university 
students making a documentary on the homeless as the videotape 
rolled connors grabbed simpsons pistol chased the 19year police 
veteran and opened fire wounding him and then fatally shooting him 
in the head police and witnesses said 
he began pursuing the officer the officer hit the ground he 
the transient coldbloodedly pursued him said will douglas of 
los angeles a witness who was driving through the area i saw the

the military government blamed lawlessness 
for delaying free elections and official sources said balloting to 
end more than a quartercentury of oneparty rule might not take 
place until 1990 
we need peace and tranquility in the country if there is no 
law and order how can we have elections said brig gen khin 
nyunt ranked no 2 in a military council that has ruled burma since 
it seized power sept 18 and brutally put down a nationwide uprising 
the general did not specify friday what disorder the nation was 
experiencing and there has been no known resurgence of violent 
protest since the government by its count killed 500 people after 
the takeover 
western diplomats say about 1000 were killed and dispute the 
governments claim that most of those killed were looters and 
destructive elements not prodemocracy demonstrators 
khin nyunt told a news conference the government would keep 
schools closed maintain a curfew and continue restrictions on 
opposition parties being mentioned in the state controlled media 
further opening will come slowly he said 
he repeatedly denied the government had arrested tortured or 
executed student activists who had returned from border areas after 
fleeing the military repression 
the londonbased human rights group amnesty international claimed 
earlier this month that students returning from the thaiburmese 
border had been arrested the us state department said it had 
credible reports that some returnees had been executed 
rangoon says about 2000 students and others who participated in 
prodemocracy demonstrations last year have returned home among 
them 320 repatriated under a thai governmentsponsored program 
shunned by the international community including former aid 
donors japan and west germany the military has attempted to improve 
its tarnished rights image 
the news conference came at the end of a threeday fourcity 
trip arranged for 46 foreign correspondents who interviewed nearly 
150 repatriated students and some of their parents 
burmese officials could not recall such a large foreign press 
presence since the country gained independence from britain in 1948 
speaking with the authorities present most students denied 
knowledge of arrests or lengthy interrogations although a few said 
they knew of some returning activists who were detained 
among students the government assembled for the journalists in 
the city of taunggyi were myo win htun and kyi moe whom amnesty had 
said were feared arrested 
myo win htun charged thai authorities had exerted psychological 
pressure on him and some colleagues to return to burma from a 
special repatriation center he said he was forced to dig cesspools 
and cut down trees he went on a hunger strike to protest his return 
thailand has said that all students returned voluntarily from its 
border center 
we were not molested but were uncertain about our situation 
said aung htu a 26yearold student from meiktila he and virtually 
all others expressed their support for a democractic system and free 
elections 
khin nyunt said he could not specify the date of elections to end 
oneparty rule that began in 1962 
but official sources said these would probably not take place 
until late this year or 1990 while the military had not set a 
polling date western analysts had speculated they would be held 
before mid1989 
to date 182 political parties have registered with the election 
commission 
khim nyunt secretary of the state law and order restoration 
council acknowledged that authorities were detaining some people 
including lawyer nay min and political satirist thu ra on charges 
of inciting insurrection and endangering national unity during the 
uprisings 
but he denied nay min and thu ra had been tortured or poorly 
treated in detention 
uprisings last year prompted the resignation of ne win who took 
over in a 1962 military coup prodemocracy protests by hundreds of 
thousands of people forced the resignation of his successor and led 
to the sacking of another by the military

federal investigators probing allegations of 
widespread fraud at the nations largest futures exchanges pressured 
three suspects into secretly taping conversations with employers and 
other traders a newspaper reported today 
the three were among a number of traders suspected of fraud who 
have provided the fbi with fresh evidence in the twoyear probe the 
chicago tribune said quoting unidentified sources 
fbi agents have been visiting the homes of traders suspected of 
wrongdoing threatening them with criminal charges and demanding 
cooperation the newspaper reported 
law enforcement sources said the three suspects were fitted with 
hidden recording devices and told to call on colleagues to obtain 
recorded admissions of guilt from those involved in fraud at the 
chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
the investigation centers on allegations that investors were 
cheated out of millions of dollars according to published reports 
seats on the exchanges which go for hundreds of thousands of 
dollars have been selling like hot commodities by traders panicked 
by the probe 
fourteen seats were sold at the merc and the board of trade 
starting thursday when the investigation was first reported 
through the end of business hours friday 
we had a weeks worth of sales in a day said andrew yemma 
chief spokesman for the merc 
officials in the fbi and us attorneys office have said nothing 
publicly about the investigation but news of subpoenas for exchange 
records dating back to january 1983 has shaken the industry 
everybody is obviously concerned about what this means said 
board of trade spokesman raymond carmichael 
if there are people breaking the rules of course people that 
make an honest living in this business think they ought to be 
punished a merc pork belly trader who asked that his name not be 
used said after a day of trading friday 
the moods very uneasy said a soybean futures trader who 
also asked that his name not be used everybodys worried about 
whats going to happen its very unsettling to longtime 
members 
commodities exchanges are hotbeds of capitalism in which 
speculators bet millions of dollars on the future prices of goods 
ranging from gold to treasury bills to frozen orange juice 
fbi agentsturnedtraders recorded conversations that suggest 
some trades were rigged to prevent customers from getting 
fairmarket prices and that some brokers sent false reports to 
customers to hide the skimming of profits of overcharges on 
commissions the chicago tribune has said 
fbi spokeswoman jane koshutko would neither confirm nor deny the 
investigation but two law enforcement officials in washington 
speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed it thursday 
the seats which allow traders access to various markets on the 
trading floor sell for a wide range of prices the merc has 2724 
seats and the board of trade has 3400 
last year the price of a merc seat ranged from 350000 to 
523500 officials said prices for board of trade seats ranged 
from 371000 to 545000

the fbis undercover probe of the worlds two 
largest futures exchanges exposes the fraud potential that many 
believe is inherent in the industrys raucous centuryold trading 
method 
the investigation of the chicago board of trade and the chicago 
mercantile exchange reportedly targets individual traders who rigged 
trades and skimmed profits 
unlike wall streets insidertrading scandal which apparently 
involved a relatively small number of professionals active in a 
limited segment of the stock market the commodities allegations 
strike at the heart of the futures industry the crowded trading 
pits where the business actually takes place 
experts say the frenetic trading system used in the pits provides 
opportunity for fraud and raises problems in tracking whether 
traders are obeying the rules 
futures traders in the pits stand shouldertoshoulder 
frequently for hours at a time shouting and using hand signals to 
strike deals 
this system is known as openoutcry trading and has remained 
essentially unchanged since the early days of grain trading on the 
141yearold chicago board of trade the worlds oldest and largest 
futures exchange 
trading is permitted only in the pits during specified trading 
hours and traders are forbidden by exchange rules from playing 
favorites a trader seeking to sell a contract must accept the first 
offer that meets his asking price 
at least part of the fbi probe is believed to be focused on pairs 
of traders who arranged ahead of time complicated trading schemes 
that would allow both of them to share in profits skimmed from 
customer accounts 
such schemes often involve executing customer orders and trading 
for ones own account simultaneously a controversial but entirely 
legal practice 
the investigation also is believed to have uncovered instances in 
which traders simply reported to their brokerage firms trades that 
were different from the trades they actually made 
these instances also require collusion among traders because 
exchange rules require both the buyer and the seller to report their 
trades 
prearranged trading and commodity fraud are nothing new traders 
readily admit that the potential is always there for those so 
inclined partly because of the difficulty in monitoring traders 
both inside and outside of the pits 
it is not unusual for unscrupulous traders to be caught on 
thursday even as news of the fbi probe was breaking the chicago 
merc announced the unrelated expulsion of two of its members for 
prearranging trades 
the most alarming aspects of the fbi investigation are its 
breadth one news service reported that 150 people could be 
implicated and its depth undercover agents wearing concealed 
microphones reportedly recorded conversations with other traders on 
and off the exchange floors over a period of two years 
theres a fear of the unknown among chicagos trading 
community said john troelstrup an industry lawyer its the 
sudden realization that they have been in the midst of people who 
are not of them wearing wires 
some experts see the advent of electronic trading using 
computerized rather than human traders to match customer buy and 
sell orders as a way to reduce the fraud potential of commodities 
trading 
the chicago mercantile exchange is a leader in this area and is 
preparing to launch a fully automated trading system called globex 
that would operate during the hours its trading floor is closed 
the chicago board of trade opposes the concept saying the 
openoutcry system is more efficient and has raised objections with 
federal regulators who have yet to approve globex 
but even electronic trading would not erase the potential for 
abuse experts say 
it will be easier to keep track of trades that are recorded 
electronically than it is when you depend on people in the pits to 
write them down in the midst of furor said one industry 
consultant but just like electronic banking theyll have 
problems that nobody anticipated 
somebody who knows the system can figure out innovative ways to 
beat the system he said

commodities exchanges are hotbeds of capitalism in which 
speculators essentially bet millions of dollars on the future prices 
of goods ranging from gold to treasury bills to frozen orange juice 
the purpose of the futures exchanges is to transfer the risk of 
price fluctuations from people who dont want the risk such as 
farmers or metals processors to speculators who are willing to take 
a gamble on making big profits 
futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods 
at a specified price at a certain time in the future options which 
also are widely traded on the exchanges give purchasers the right 
but not the obligation to buy or sell something at a certain price 
within a specified period 
commodities traders standing in recessed pits and dressed in 
brightly colored jackets shout orders and wave hand signals to each 
other in a freeforall auction of contracts 
because trading is so chaotic some rules infractions are hard to 
detect immediately for example a dishonest trader could cheat a 
client by paying more than necessary for a contract ordered by the 
client the seller who got the extra profit would later return the 
favor 
in a typical transaction on a commodities exchange a farmer who 
wants to lock in a guaranteed price to minimize risk will promise to 
deliver 20000 pounds of live beef cattle at a specified future date 
at a specified price 
assuming the price goes up the speculator who buys the contract 
could take the cattle from the farmer and resell them to someone 
else at the higher prevailing market price pocketing the profit 
but if the price goes down the speculator would lose money by 
having to pay the farmer the agreedupon price and then resell the 
cattle at the lower market price 
in practice speculators rarely end up with mountains of tin or 
pork bellies they sell their positions at a profit or loss before 
the delivery date the ultimate buyer is a customer that actually 
needs the commodity 
although the exchanges started out with agricultural products 
they have rapidly expanded into financial products for example the 
chicago board of trade does most of its business in contracts based 
on the value of the standard amp poors 100stock and 500stock 
indexes 
other major exchanges include the chicago mercantile exchange 
the new york mercantile exchange the commodity exchange in new 
york the new york cotton exchange the coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange and abroad the london international financing futures 
exchange

a sri lankan man deported from britain 
after a twoyear battle for asylum returned home today and accused 
the british government of racism 
viraj mendis had sought asylum since late 1986 by holing up in an 
english church his fight ended when british authorities broke into 
the church wednesday and two days later put him on an air lanka 
flight to his indian ocean homeland 
i am happy to be back in my homeland but i am angry for being 
deported by the racist british government the 32yearold mendis 
told reporters upon his arrival 
he was escorted by a british policeman two british immigration 
officers and the rev henry west an anglican priest who described 
himself as a friend 
mendis said he feared persecution or death if he returned to sri 
lanka which is wracked by ethnic violence between guerrillas of the 
majority sinhalese and the minority tamils nearly 10000 people 
have died in five years of fighting 
foreign ministry secretary wt jayasimsghe said i dont think 
anything is going to happen to mr mendis 
but mendis said the government couldnt guarantee his safety 
i am a sinhalese and as a communist support the tamil 
liberation struggle i fear the sinhalese chauvinists and of 
course i dont believe any assurance given by the sri lankan 
government 
police arrested mendis in the northern english city of 
manchester he had moved into the church after being issued a 
deportation order in 1986 13 years after going to britain as a 
student 
mendis removal from the church sparked an outcry from 
supporters who said the action violated his ancient right to 
sanctuary in a church 
under english common law a person accused of committing a crime 
could take sanctuary in a church but had to surrender or leave the 
country in 40 days this right was abolished in 1623 but mendis 
supporters chose the ancient right as his last resort to stay in 
britain 
mendis was met at the airport by his younger brother suresh and 
an uncle eugene fernando 
mendis said he would not be living with his family in the 
southern town of kalutara for security reasons instead he 
said he is heading for an undisclosed location to write his memoirs

about 26000 troops 120 aircraft and 
1000 vehicles from canada and the united states began maneuvers 
across alaska in the militarys regular test of personnel and 
machines in freezing temperatures 
this may be the premier coldweather exercise in the free 
world air force lt gen thomas g mcinerney commander of joint 
task forcealaska said friday as the biennal exercise began friday 
brim frost 89 a 15 million training exercise involving 
the us army air force marines coast guard national guard 
reserve units and the canadian forces is to continue through feb 
1 
we hold some exercises like this in norway but theyre a 
little different mcinerney said here you have an entire army 
division operating in an arctic environment 
maneuvers were planned at more than 17 sites around alaska 
including kodiak island in the pacific ocean but the focus will be 
a major land battle between two army brigades on the tanana flats at 
fort greely about 75 miles southeast of fairbanks 
that will include a battalionsized canadian force dropped by 
parachute officials said 
it will be a rehearsal of the procedures wed have to go 
through if we actually had to defend alaska said army maj gen 
harold t fields jr in charge of land forces during the exercise 
brim frost 87 slightly smaller with 24000 troops focused 
primarily on unconventional warfare where alaska forces faced 
guerrilla units and defended airfields remote radar stations 
ports a transalaska oil pipeline pump station and other sites from 
attack 
planners said they will emphasize safety throughout brim frost 
89 no live ammunition is to be used but troops will face 
temperatures that are expected to plummet to 50 degrees below zero 
safety is a very challenging thing mcinerney said if you 
dont have any accidents then its a tribute to your 
professionalism 
our track record in the past has been very good fields said 
last month 3500 soldiers at fort greely trained in weather that 
was 44 below zero and they came through the exercise with no serious 
coldrelated injuries 
fields said at a news conference wednesday there is a lot of 
difference between simply being out in the cold and operating in the 
cold 
well not back off our exercises simply because the weather 
drops fields said it teaches you how to cope our potential 
adversaries are very good at this business

promoters conceded that super bowl week was a 
fiasco but remained confident the weekend festivities and game 
could be salvaged despite three days of rioting and racial unrest 
there is no question that it really hurts but we think our 
community can recover charles scurr president of the greater 
miami super bowl host committee said friday its already started 
the mood is lifting and i think people will be able to enjoy the 
celebration 
miami once viewed super bowl week as a crown jewel in the tourism 
comeback for south florida 
frank sinatra liza minnelli and sammy davis performed friday 
night at the miami arena and another concert was scheduled for 
tonight 
at a miami shopping center and park thousands of excited 
partiers watched fireworks explode over biscayne bay and listened to 
salsa and jazz bands 
in miami beach 3000 people held a bash held by national 
football league commissioner pete rozelle at the stephen muss 
convention center 
miami has worked to rebuild its image as a tourist mecca since 
1980 when the troubles began devastating riots that year the 
mariel boatlift the upspurt in the drug trade and bad press such as 
a paradise lost cover story in time magazine 
those factors created such an unappealing perception of the 
place said ruben aguilar an executive with the greater miami 
convention and visitors bureau we lost 13 million tourists in 
the next five years 
but in the last few years he said we felt like we were on a 
roll 
earlier this week riots triggered by the shooting of a black 
motorcyclist by a hispanic policeman left one man dead and 11 others 
shot in two black neighborhoods thirteen buildings were torched and 
others looted authorities said 
veteran miami publicist hank meyer said the tragedy of those 
riots went far beyond the damage to the tourism industry and the 
citys image 
i was saddened a feeling of shock disbelief said the 
68yearold meyer who has lived here for 50 years 
the city has made major strides to come back after the heyday of 
the 1950s and 60s when tv shows like jackie gleasons originated 
in miami helping to make the tropical city popular throughout the 
country meyer said 
but in the 1970s the hotels began to age too many apartments 
and condos were built and the economy declined 
the devestating blow came in 1980 with the boatlift and the 
riots which killed 18 and injured hundreds more riots followed in 
1982 and 1984 
the miami area had about 7 million visitors in 1980 it finally 
approached that total again in 1988 
the completion of the colorful bayside marketplace in 1987 and 
the miami arena last year helped revive the inner city and the art 
deco district of miami beach is coming back 
landing the super bowl seemed to put the seal of approval on 
miami as a tourist destination but this weeks rioting brought the 
progress into question 
my first reaction was why now said aguilar if it had 
happened when we didnt have 2000plus media here then i dont 
think the nationwide response would have been as wideranging and 
immediate as it was 
but the city seemed to be easing back to normal police were out 
in force to assure the weekend is a success and rozelle reassured 
miami that the riots would not affect the citys chance to host 
another super bowl

as george bush slept for the first time in the 
white house 1000 revelers spent todays early morning hours 
dancing to an uptempo hail to the chief in a noholdsbarred 
spoof of his inauguration 
partygoers at the los angeles inaugural ball greeted bush 
impersonator chuck kovacic with boos and derisive whistles as the 
lookalike mimicked the new president in a satirical address 
here comes the theme kovacic said after being introduced by 
cartoon characters batman and robin and sworn in by a human statue 
of liberty a new breeze theres a new breeze blowing we all can 
feel it especially the millions who choose to sleep in the great 
outdoors 
as theres hope there will be a new breeze but if that breeze 
blows too hard it will extinguish the 1000 points of light and you 
wont be able to read my lips 
the party was held to greet the installation of bush and vice 
president dan quayle with cheery displeasure of those in attendance 
asked about their political preferences almost all voted for 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis in the november election 
the west coast inauguration advertised as the political party 
for the rest of us featured lighting by thousand points of light 
inc and performances of the satirical songs a kinder gentler 
nation and out of the loop 
admission was 15 but cardcarrying members of the american 
civil liberties union got in for 1350 any profits were to be 
donated to an environmental group 
its absolutely a celebration but of course black is to be 
worn said organizer pacy markman an advertising copywriter 
the inauguration in washington was done with smoke and mirrors 
were just merely holding up the mirror 
markman wrote both a kinder gentler nation and out of the 
loop the latter song the title of which refers to bushs 
response to questions about his involvement in the irancontra 
affair also hints at the partys real purpose to point up the 
presidents supposed shortcomings 
i was out of the loop when it happened goes the song i 
was out of the loop through it all ill give you a scoop i was out 
of the loop talking to me is like talking to a wall 
were not wishing mr bush ill markman said but the whole 
idea of this is that people have really been put to sleep by reagan 
and you can either awaken them by a slap in face or as were 
hoping to wake them up with some good humor and some excellent 
music 
we werent invited to the other inaugural but ours is not out 
of spite its very possible that we might have done this if there 
were a democrat in office

griefstricken family and friends mourned 
the deaths of five school children gunned down during recess while 
the killer was buried nearly unnoticed in a nearby town 
parents and teachers continued counseling the children who 
witnessed tuesdays schoolyard slayings trying to help them deal 
with the tragedy 
patrick purdy 24 opened fire outside the cleveland elementary 
school with an ak47 semiautomatic assault rifle firing more than 
100 rounds killing five children and wounding 29 others and one 
teacher 
three days and nights of prayer began thursday for two of the 
youngsters killed and services for the other children were being 
held today and monday gov george deukmejian was to attend mondays 
services 
purdy was buried friday in nearby lodi said his grandmother 
julia chumbley he was interred following a service at cherokee 
memorial cemetery which several of his relatives attended she said 
fourteen of the wounded students were still hospitalized but 
most were reported in improved conditions 
at cleveland school about threequarters of the schools 970 
pupils had returned to classes by friday about three times the 
number who attended wednesday but it was anything but a routine 
school day 
counselors and school psychologists were assisting teachers in 
classrooms and some parents sat in with their children to comfort 
and reassure them 
one mother who asked not to be identified told reporters that 
her youngest son a 7yearold second grader who was on playground 
when the shootings occurred would only come back to school if she 
stayed with him 
theyre making it back slowly but surely she said adding 
that she planned to spend friday as she did thursday at her sons 
side in the classroom 
cleveland school is in the heart of californias thirdlargest 
community of refugees from southeast asia and nearly twothirds of 
the schools population is from asia all of the dead children were 
from refugee families as were 19 of the 29 wounded 
school authorities said they were particularly concerned that the 
killing might not only revive the psychological trauma of the 
horrors they experienced in southeast asia but that those families 
might flee from the area without accepting counseling if they feared 
a racial motive in the attack 
we want to pass the word to the community that this is not a 
racist act it could happen to anybody anywhere anytime this 
is a crazy action from one individual it is not racism said an 
tran of the southeast asian refugee resettlement program 
stockton police capt dennis perry also repeated that there was 
no evidence that purdy who committed suicide after the attack was 
specifically targeting asians 
it wasnt any one race or group of people he hated 
everybody perry said of purdy who as a child 14 years earlier 
had attended cleveland school

lech walesa met today with solidaritys 
national executive commission to hammer out an official response to 
a communist party offer to legalize the trade federation 
the solidarity leader was expected to advise the union leadership 
to begin longdelayed talks on polands future with the communist 
government 
earlier today walesa attended a rally by 4000 workers inside 
the lenin shipyard where solidarity was born but he did not speak 
walesa summoned the commission to this baltic port to respond to 
the communist partys announcement thursday that it will legalize 
solidarity after a sevenyear ban if certain conditions are 
negotiated 
the commissions 20 members and 10 advisers and local solidarity 
activists met at st marys basilica several blocks from the 
shipyard then moved to a more private meeting place at a convent 
near the citys old town 
in the past the commission has followed walesas recommendations 
walesa winner of the 1983 nobel peace prize told suspicious 
workers at the shipyard friday he also has doubts about the 
authorities good intentions 
the polish government cracked down on the independent trade union 
federation during the labor upheaval of 1980 declaring martial law 
in december 1981 and banning solidarity the next year 
a tape recording of fridays closed 1hour meeting was obtained 
by the associated press and in reply to a question accusing 
authorities of always lying to workers walesa said i dont trust 
them either but if someone gives a chance for trade union 
pluralism i take the chance 
walesa told the worker that the partys change in policy was 
significant 
they have never proposed pluralism before and whats even more 
economic union and political pluralism our people are checking 
already today what it may mean in practice 
if we are really getting economic social and political 
pluralism i say thank you very much gentlemen it has never 
happened in the party before it will mean breaking the monopoly 
and thats the point 
later walesa told reporters at the shipyard gates i will do 
everything on my side to begin talks about poland as soon as 
possible 
but he said that was his personal view and solidaritys official 
statement would come only after the meeting of the executive 
commission 
the government proposed formal talks to include walesa the 
authorities the official trade unions and other social groups 
during a wave of strikes in august poland is wracked by economic 
unrest rising inflation scarce supplies of basic commodities and 
its 39 billion foreign debt 
after some fitful preliminary talks last year walesa refused the 
invitation until the party agreed to legalize the union 
this weeks communist party plenum seems to have satisfied that 
demand said adam michnik a senior adviser to walesa 
after that plenum communist authorities said they would be 
willing to legalize solidarity if the trade union membership 
promised to obey the law not go out on strike for a period of time 
and help reform the economy 
walesa told reporters he has to bargain with authorities because 
polands problems are so daunting 
millions of poles were treated to an unprecedented barrage of 
openness in the official news media about solidarity and other 
sensitive political topics 
the coverage left many people shaking their heads in wonder 
whats going on in poland said one worker at the gdansk 
shipyard when asked about the heavy coverage that portrayed walesa 
as an official figure even though solidarity remains technically 
illegal 
state television also showed police controlling demonstrators in 
czechoslovakia a politburo member explaining why he voted against 
the partys new position on unions and a solidarityled strike at a 
textile plant in lodz

us operators of boeing 767 jetliners have been 
ordered by the federal aviation administration to inspect the wiring 
in cargo compartment fire suppression systems 
the faa earlier required similar checks on boeing 757 jets 
mitch barker spokesman for the faas northwest regional office 
here said the airworthiness directive was issued late friday as a 
precautionary measure because of the similarity between the fire 
protection systems on the two models 
last week the faa issued an airworthiness directive for us 
operators of the midsized 757s to check the cargo hold 
firesuppression systems after wiring problems were found on a royal 
brunei jet and a delta airlines 757 airlines around the world 
subsequently found wiring mistakes on five more 757s 
investigators said some of the errors would have caused the wrong 
extinquisher to work in the event of a cargo hold fire other 
mistakes would have indicated a fire to the pilot without activating 
an extinguisher 
wiring in boeing planes got widespread public attention recently 
following the jan 7 crash of a british midlands boeing 737 in 
central england in which 44 people died faulty wiring is one 
possibility being examined by investigators 
on thursday boeing commercial airplanes asked 26 operators of 
767s worldwide to check the fire extinguisher wiring 
we put one out yesterday alerting 767 operators worldwide to 
inspect their fire extinguishing systems not because there was any 
incident involving a 767 but because it was prudent boeing 
spokesman david jimenez said friday he said the faa directive now 
just ensures it will be checked 
both jimenez and barker said they knew of no wiring problems on 
767s although jimenez said that last spring some piping for 
cargohold fire extinguishers on 767s were found to be misconnected 
that problem was corrected boeing said 
barker said the 767 order calls for a check of cargo 
compartment fire protection system wiring and if necessary to 
ensure the wiring is correctly configured 
he said us operators of the planes will be required to make the 
inspection by jan 30 and to report any findings of incorrect wiring 
to the faa within 72 hours of making the check 
barker said the us operators affected are american airlines 
with 40 767s delta airlines with 30 united airlines with 19 
piedmont with 11 and trans world airlines with 11 
worldwide there are 246 767s in service jimenez said while the 
faa order is not binding on foreign carriers barker said many 
foreign regulatory agencies often follow the faas lead in requiring 
inspections 
the 757 and 767 both twinengine jets were designed at the same 
time in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
the 767 which carries 170 to 261 passengers depending upon 
model and configuration entered service in 1982 the 757 which 
entered service in 1984 can carry between 186 and 239 passengers

more than 1700 cabinet members lawmakers and other 
government workers paid their respects to the late emperor hirohito 
in a ceremony at the imperial palace today palace officials said 
the officials said 1748 people attended the ceremony held from 
morning through evening at the palace hinkyu or imperial 
mortuary where the body of the late emperor will remain until his 
funeral on feb 24 
hirohito died jan 7 of cancer at age 87 
prime minister noboru takeshita and leading members of the three 
branches of government paid their respects in a similar ceremony 
friday a day after the emperors coffin was moved to the makeshift 
mortuary the officials said 
in addition ceremonies will be held almost daily at the mortuary 
until the funeral next month with members of the imperial family 
and shinto ritualists offering prayers food and court music 
shinto derives from ancient nature worship and today includes 
worship of the sun goddess the imperial ancestors and thousands of 
other deities 
also today a newspaper reported that hirohitos son and 
successor emperor akihito wrote in an essay in 1945 that japans 
lack of group skills material wealth and technological prowess led 
to its world war ii defeat despite the innate japanese superiority 
over americans 
the essay penned by the then 11yearold crown prince was 
copied by the late vice grand chamberlain michio kinoshita an 
employee of the imperial household agency and recently disclosed 
if an individual japanese is compared with an individual 
american a japanese is superior on every point the crown price 
wrote shortly after the war the daily japan times reported but 
akihito added that japanese lacked skills to efficiently organize 
group strength 
the people gathered their courage and fought diligently but 
the war was lost nevertheless the crown prince wrote that is 
because the angloamerican forces had incomparable material 
superiority and because americas war tactics were extremely 
skillful 
japanese thought more of themselves than of their country and 
acted selfishly that is why we were not able to win this total 
war he wrote 
he described the radio broadcast by his father in 1945 announcing 
japans unconditional surrender to the allies as a fearful thing 
for his father to bear the peoples humiliation he also 
expressed regret over the defeat 
the crown prince wrote of his determination that japan be rebuilt 
after the wartime destruction

the leader of a nationwide 
whitesupremacist group accused by colleagues of misconduct and 
womanizing claimed he won a unanimous vote of confidence at a 
meeting today 
several of the dissenters said they were barred from the 
auditorium or ejected before the vote was taken 
armed members of the group wearing its swastikalike emblem 
patrolled outside the hall under the surveillance of about 100 
policemen 
eugene terreblanche a fiery orator who often closes his speeches 
with a hitlerstyle salute has headed the afrikaner resistance 
movement since he helped found it in 1973 its membership is kept 
secret but terreblanche often draws thousands of whites to his 
rallies 
the unprecedented challenge to his leadership began last month 
after he allegedly tried to ram his car through a gate at an 
afrikaner historical monument near johannesburg he was accompanied 
by jani allan a former model who now writes a column for the 
nationally circulated sunday times 
terreblanche who is married has denied any improper 
relationship with ms allan she had previously interviewed 
terreblanche for one of her columns 
the incident led to police filing a charge of malicious damage 
against terreblanche and four senior members of the resistance 
movement demanded his resignation one of them accused terreblanche 
of womanizing and excessive drinking charges which terreblanche 
denied 
about 300 members of the resistance movement known by its 
afrikaans initials as the awb attended todays meeting at a hall 
in pretoria 
dries alberts a former awb spokesman who had joined in 
challenging terreblanche told reporters he was carried out of the 
meeting hall in his wheelchair after he arrived other dissenters 
said they were barred from entering the hall 
today would have been an ideal opportunity for solving the 
awbs serious problems but the meeting has been turned into an 
utter farce alberts said 
terreblanche declined to field questions from awb delegates but 
gave a 30minute speech in which to loud cheers he reiterated his 
call for creation of a whitesonly state in south africa 
there will not and cannot be schism in the awb he said 
the press thought i was going to resign today but they will be 
resigning instead 
after the meeting some reporters were invited to attend a brief 
news conference but the sunday times representative was not 
allowed in 
despite its extremist stance the awb is viewed as politically 
influential because of its ties to the conservative party which won 
26 percent of the vote in the 1987 white election on a platform 
urging tougher enforcement of segregation laws 
the governing national party has emphasized the link between the 
awb and the conservatives seeking to suggest that the opposition 
party is reliant on dangerous extremists

a key senator said today the 
government probably would let former president ferdinand marcos come 
home if he returned money he is accused of stealing and made a 
public apology 
jovito salonga the senate president said he believes marcos 
must do what south koreas disgraced former president chun 
doohwan did last year 
if marcos decides to do a chun doohwan that is make a 
public apology seek our peoples forgiveness and restore his 
illgotten wealth there will be enough time for the former 
president and his lawyers to initiate a plea bargaining process 
with the new york courts and prosecutors authorities in 
washington and the government of the philippines said salonga 
the government of president corazon aquino has refused to allow 
marcos to return to the philippines he fled to hawaii after he was 
swept out of office in february 1986 in a militarycivilian uprising 
that put mrs aquino in power 
marcos and his wife imelda face racketeering charges in new 
york they are accused of looting 103 million from the philippines 
and using it in part to buy real estate in new york 
critics say marcos accumulated 510 billion during his 20year 
administration 
salonga added that if marcos decides to insist on his innocence 
and refuses to do a chun doohwan the aquino government may no 
longer be blamed for refusing to consider his return 
chun made a public apology to his country in november 
surrendered assets worth 24 million and went into rural exile in a 
remote temple 
the senate president who formerly chaired a committee leading a 
worldwide search for money marcos is accused of stealing made his 
remarks today to a lawyers group in the central port city of cebu 
the associated press acquired a copy of his speech in manila 
in new york a dispute over whether marcos is too ill to be 
arraigned on racketeering charges remains unresolved the 
71yearold marcos suffered a collapsed lung thursday and was 
reported hospitalized in honolulu

the wedding took place at the head of a snowplowed heart 
surrounded by fish houses 
several of our friends have fish houses out there so there 
were places to go to warm up julius said some people fished 
the icefishing nuptials jan 14 started as a joke for the 
couple who got engaged last valentines day but after awhile the 
joke started to make sense 
we spend an awful lot of time out there ice fishing anyway so 
we thought we might as well get married out there issendorf said 
the temperature reached into the 20s so the couple didnt even 
need the snowmobile suits they thought they would need for the 
20minute ceremony 
instead the bride wore a white flannel shirt and blue corduroy 
pants over her long underwear an ivorywhite hat royal blue coat 
leg warmers over boots and a beaded scarf completed the look 
the groom wore a green and purple plaid flannel shirt and navy 
corduroy pants

west germany today closed its embassy 
in kabul sources said becoming the first foreign mission to shut 
down amid fears of an economic blockade and increased violence after 
all soviet troops are withdrawn 
the three remaining west german diplomats left this afternoon on 
a flight for new delhi india with no prior announcement said the 
western diplomatic sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in bonn the west german foreign ministry confirmed it ordered 
its diplomats to leave kabul because of fears of increasing 
violence but it said the embassy would continue to function on a 
reduced status and that the diplomats could return if the 
situation in kabul improves 
other western embassis say they are reviewing their positions now 
that it appears the soviets may remove all their remaining troops by 
next month 
the british embasy this week warned britons and nationals of six 
other countries for which it has diplomatic responsibiity to leave 
immediately 
earlier today the soviet union airlifted food supplies to the 
afghan capital to combat shortages caused by rebel attacks and bad 
weather tass said 
the official soviet news agency reported from kabul that the 
3500ton airlift began friday with three special flights 
an englishlanguage tass report monitored in moscow said six 
flights arrived today with flour and other food supplies 
there was no immediate independent confirmation the flights had 
arrived 
traffic has been heavy at the airport since the beginning of the 
month with giant transport planes arriving and leaving daily as 
soviet troops try to meet a feb 15 deadline to depart afghanistan 
the afghan capital is increasingly tense because the withdrawal 
date for the final 50000 soviet soldiers is drawing closer 
in bonn juergen chrobog chief spokesman for the west german 
foreign ministry said the remaining diplomats and their families 
left kabul today 
but he said the embassy would continue to function on a reduced 
status and be maintained by a small local staff 
chrobog said the envoys had been ordered home on leave because 
of the growing danger and worsening economic conditions chrobog 
said he did not know how long the diplomatic staff would remain out 
of the country 
we intend to watch developments there carefully before making a 
decision on when to return he said 
soviet officals have warned they might not meet the deadline set 
in a unbrokered accord because of continuing us and pakistani 
assistance to the antimarxist resistance 
but recent reports indicate soviet soldiers might be gone from 
kabul by early february to protect the salang highway during the 
final withdrawal 
un aid officials welcomed the reported airlift and urged 
similar help from western nations which refuse to deal with the 
promarxist government of president najib 
guerrilla disruption of convoys which are also carrying 
ammunition has been increasing as soviet troops hand over escort 
duties and positions to government units along the key salang 
highway from the soviet border bad weather also has held up convoys 
todays englishlanguage tass report mentioned significant 
shortages because of the effort by the unreconcilable opposition to 
organize an economic blockade of the city it also accused some 
kabul traders of engaging in open sabotage by hoarding food 
food prices have doubled in recent weeks and long bread lines 
have formed in 20degree temperatures 
the soviet union has promised to keep supplying arms to najibs 
shaky government after feb 15 but it is uncertain whether moscow 
will continue to supply kabul where guerrilla groups have closed in 
in the surrounding hills 
the soviet military which intervened in afghanistan in 1979 is 
expected to move its command from kabul to a northern border post at 
the end of january

after 11 years of silence about his crimes 
condemned killer ted bundy began confessing to about 30 murders of 
young women in five western states just days before his scheduled 
execution an attorney said 
murders are being solved volusia county state attorney john 
tanner who befriended bundy told the orlando sentinel on friday 
night 
bundy faces death in the electric chair at 7 am tuesday at 
florida state prison near starke for the 1978 murder of a 
12yearold girl in lake city 
tanner said law enforcement officers from western states told him 
that the 42yearold former law student is giving them verifiable 
hard facts concerning unsolved murders the newspaper reported 
today 
after a 40minute hearing this morning us district judge g 
kendall sharp rejected bundys latest appeal ruling there was no 
evidence a lower court judge talked privately to prosecutors about 
bundys mental competence the state supreme court curtly rejected 
his appeal friday 
bundys attorney james coleman said he would appeal to the 11th 
us circuit court of appeals in atlanta 
tanner would not identify the officers who spoke to him but said 
bundy met friday with robert keppel of the washington state attorney 
generals office and bill hagmaier of the fbi behavioral sciences 
unit in quantico va 
keppel met with bundy from late friday morning until late evening 
and planned to meet with him today the seattle postintelligencer 
said keppel refused to discuss details of the conversations until 
he completed them 
florida corrections department spokesman bob macmaster said early 
today he had no information on anything bundy may have told other 
law enforcement agencies 
bundy has frequently met with investigators and reporters but 
previously refused to talk specifically about any cases 
he was also scheduled to meet over the weekend with authorities 
from colorado utah and idaho 
bundy who has also been sentenced to death for the 1978 slayings 
of two sorority sisters at florida state university in tallahassee 
is suspected in as many as three dozen slayings in washington 
idaho oregon utah and colorado the victims were young women many 
of whom were never found his case inspired the book the 
deliberate stranger and the television miniseries of the same name 
in considering bundys appeal friday the state supreme court not 
only ruled against him but said it would not permit a petition for 
rehearing it called the attempt to raise the issue of mental 
competency again an abuse of process 
tanner a former defense attorney who was elected to the 
prosecutors post in november was widely criticized wednesday when 
gov bob martinez and other state officials announced he was trying 
to negotiate a stay of execution but he said friday that he is not 
advocating that bundys life be spared 
i want to emphasize that my role was to put ted bundy in 
contact with law enforcement and ive done that tanner said 
its disturbed me that its come out any different its caused 
the people i represent to be very angry at me 
authorities from western states have said they want bundy to 
clear up the unsolved murders but not if it meant delaying his 
execution 
certainly we want to know but im not sure it matters to the 
extent of keeping him alive said king county sheriffs lt dan

thirty boxes of stolen books that mysteriously 
turned up on a library doorstep earlier this month have been traced 
to a woman who died last year authorities said 
the boxes returned to the thornhill branch county library jan 3 
along with several more boxes and other missing library items 
recovered yielded 4369 books and magazines worth about 28000 
library spokeswoman jo ann rogers said friday 
the mystery was solved when a lawyer for the womans estate 
called several days after the initial dropoff and asked that the 
library pick up the remaining books rogers said the library 
dispatched a van to pick up the other boxes and staff members 
needed two weeks to count sort and return most of the materials to 
regular circulation 
the haul included 1300 paperback novels most of them romances 
and more than 400 magazines the magazines and about 90 paperbacks 
were not returned to circulation because they were in bad condition 
or out of date 
most of the items appeared to have been taken between 1969 and 
1984 when an electronic beeper security system was introduced at 
the thornhill branch rogers said none of the books had been 
checked out 
rogers declined to identify the person who had taken the material 
other than as an elderly woman who was a heavy user of thornhill 
materials 
rogers said the library had decided against charging penalties to 
the womans estate because the missing items had never been checked 
out in the first place and thus carried no overdue fines and 
because the items had been returned voluntarily

a roman catholic magazine today said pope john paul 
ii plans to visit south africa in 1990 but the vatican refused to 
confirm the report 
the monthly 30 days said the vatican has tentatively scheduled 
the trip for either april or september of next year 
the magazine quoted an unidentified vatican source as saying it 
would have been unjust to punish an entire christian community 
for the sole fact that it finds itself living under a morally 
reprehensible regime 
a summary of the report scheduled to appear in the magazines 
february issue was sent to news agencies today 
a vatican spokesman the rev giovanni dercole said he was 
unaware of any plans for the pontiff to make his first official 
visit to the country the pope has criticized south africas 
apartheid policies of racial segregation 
the pontiff made an unscheduled landing in johannesburg during a 
september 1988 trip to southern africa when foul weather and 
mechanical problems diverted his plane while at the airport he met 
with foreign minister pik botha 
the pope is to return to africa this spring but he is not 
scheduled to visit south africa 
in the past catholic bishops in south africa have advised the 
pope against visiting the country whose population of 24 million 
includes more than 2 million catholics 
but the bishops have recently dropped their opposition according 
to the magazine which quoted archbishop of durban denis hurley as 
saying the pope must come here soon his followers cannot wait

with the red army nearly gone the 
capitals last line of defense is manned by disheveled afghan 
troopers huddled around an armored vehicle hugging themselves 
against the biting cold 
half a dozen tanks stand on the treeless snowcovered terrain to 
the right of the soldiers arranged in a rough semicircle with 
cannons pointed north 
shivering in their filthy uniforms the troops stand at the foot 
of the vital salang highway three miles outside kabul with orders 
to stop moslem guerrillas who have isolated the city since the 
soviets left the countryside 
this final line against the moslem insurgency that began with a 
commuist coup in 1978 looks as uncertain as the future after feb 
15 the deadline for the soviets to end their role in a war they 
joined nine years ago 
departing soviet military forces leave behind a regime 
stockpiling ammunition for a battle of survival with the guerrillas 
who ring the capital in mountain bases and have rejected proposals 
for a political settlement 
kabuls daily life is a tableau of war suffering fear and 
efforts to escape amputees hobble in the potholed sreets long 
lines wait for visas at the indian embassy 
the us embassy shut its visa section last month after a deluge 
of more than 250 applications a day compared with five a month last 
year 
food and fuel are scarce because of guerrilla attacks on convoys 
along the salang making the bitter weather even harder to bear the 
highway connects kabul to the soviet border carrying red army 
soldiers home and supply convoys south toward the capital 
giant ilyushin 76 transports drop cascades of antimissile flares 
as they climb from the kabul airport bound for moscow with soldiers 
and civilian advisers after delivering cargoes of ammunition 
an average of six planes arrive and depart daily hundreds of 
fully equipped soviet troops have been seen boarding them 
incoming road convoys roar down the salang with ammunition as 
well as food and fuel 
north of the salang pass toward the border soviet troops are 
digging in at new positions diplomats say apparently to secure the 
road for the final withdrawal 
workmen in kabul are felling an avenue of trees and leveling the 
ground on either side of a long wide road that runs from the 
darulaman palace headquarters of the defense ministry past the 
soviet embassy 
it is wide enough to accommodate smaller antonov transports and 
there is speculation the soviets are preparing an emergency airstrip 
indications are that thousands of afghans including supporters 
or beneficiaries of the current regime are trying to slip away or 
make arrangements for quick exits 
since the us embassy stopped issuing visas lines form outside 
the embassy of india the nearest country for those who can afford 
air fare 
most embassies down to skeleton staffs with families already 
evacuated have contingency plans to close the us embassy has 11 
american staff members left and says the question of whether to stay 
is under constant review 
un aid agencies have instructions from headquarters in new york 
to withdraw 20 foreign staff by the end of january leaving just 
eight 
the west german foreign ministry on saturday confirmed that it 
had ordered its diplomats to leave kabul 
furhatted soviet troops still man mountainside artillery 
emplacements on kabuls outskirts but have handed over some posts on 
the perimeter road 
rumors abound including one that soviets are about to move part 
of their military headquarters from kabul to mazaresharaf that 
city is near the soviet border and more importantly on the other 
side of the daunting hindu kush mountain range 
some analysts believe the guerrillas who have reduced rocket 
attacks on the capital are holding off a major assault to let the 
soviets out 
president najib fills his public pronouncements with a blend of 
exhortations to fight on and urgings that the guerrillas resume 
talks with kremlin representatives on a political solution 
we will forge ahead and struggle he told a recent gathering 
to mark the ninth anniversary of the feared ministry of state 
security 
an estimated 115000 soviet soldiers were in afghanistan when 
withdrawal began may 15 under a unmediated agreement signed in 
geneva half were gone by aug 15 and feb 15 is the deadline for 
all to be withdrawn

visits to their old battlefields this week 
were a blend of tears and cheers remembrance and reunions for six 
former us marines one was reminded that a broken toe may have 
saved his life 
bill johnson a 41yearold maker of electric signs from 
manchester conn wept as he walked through cam lo feeling the 
sting of a war he fought more than 20 years ago and the loss of men 
who served under him 
johnson did not remember cam lo as the peaceful village it is 
today but as the site of an attack on his squad part of the 11th 
engineers who cleaned viet cong mines from the highways and planted 
their own to protect us bases 
fortunately for me we had gone on a detail to do some work and 
something fell on my foot and broke my toe johnson said 
he had to remain in the rear at dong ha and another sergeant took 
over his squad they swept highway 9 west to cam lo and stayed 
overnight 
a north vietnamese battalion attacked cam lo that night and the 
first rocketpropelled grenades hit the engineer squads truck 
around which the men were sleeping it started a fire that burned 
some of them to death 
the 11th marines were based just below the demilitarized zone 
that divided north and south vietnam at the 17th parallel and five 
of the six men in vietnam now served in the battalion but none had 
ventured into the dmz until last week 
ever think youd be standing here nate genna a 41yearold 
maintenance worker from boston asked gene spanos 39 a police 
lieutenant in rosemont ill 
no way brother spanos replied as they walked across the ben 
hai bridge that divided the country until victory by the north in 
april 1975 
escorting them by an irony of war was col ho minh thanh who 
had tried to kill them a generation earlier by planting land mines 
on the highways they traveled 
johnson took a picture of his former foe spanos asked thanh to 
autograph a map at the point where they were standing and both 
former marines shook the colonels hand 
this the guys wont believe spanos said and johnson 
commented 
he put them in we took them out he was putting in the mines 
at night that we were taking out in the morning in the road that 
was his specialty he said he was good at it were glad we were 
good at our work or we wouldnt be meeting each other today 
thanh said both the american people and the vietnamese people 
dont like war now we talk we dont want to fight each other 
again we want to be friends not enemies 
i dont feel any bitterness johnson said some veterans 
may probably some families who lost a son if you look at the 
reality these people were hurting as bad as we were i hope nobody 
back in the states looks negatively on our visit here 
it was a sad journey for the marines in many ways but there were 
light moments 
at the government guest house in dong ha where the visitors 
stayed children waited at the gate each day to cheer them as they 
left and again as they returned 
when the americans left their van to retrace their steps and 
reminisce at landmarks they remembered scores of children followed 
as if the men were leading a parade 
mike wallace a 41yearold farmer from langdon kan brought a 
photo of a vietnamese woman and her infant son he snapped while 
building a road to con thien he asked col thanh if the woman was 
still around 
she was thanh knew her well and led wallace and the others to 
her thatchedroof hut in chau hau village just off the dirt road 
there wallace was reunited with hoan thi chit 56 and her son 
now 25 they smiled and posed for pictures and the son son put his 
arm around wallace 
the americans biggest surprise however came as they left mrs 
chits home thanh told the former enemy she had been his top viet 
cong agent and both men laughed

president bush today took some time away from 
the 25 million extravaganza marking his inauguration to try out his 
oval office chair and to get down to business declaring that those 
holding us hostages in lebanon will not gain any concessions from 
the united states 
after opening the white house grounds to the public and leading 
about 15 people on a tour of his new home bush invited his mother 
dorothy prescott bush and some reporters into the oval office where 
he amplified some remarks included in his inaugural address friday 
asked whether his plea friday for assistance in the hostage 
matter was an extension of an olive branch to the hostageholders 
bush said i want to make clear to them that good will begets good 
will 
we are not going to escalate the currency of holding americans 
hostage we are not going to have people feel that we are going to 
make concessions in order to free those precious lives bush said 
in his inaugural address bush had said of the hostages there 
are today americans who are held against their will in foreign 
lands and americans who are unaccounted for assistance can be 
shown here and will be long remembered good will begets good 
will 
the day started early with yet another event marking the 
inauguration of the nations 41st president the white house grounds 
were opened to the public 
this is the peoples house and it does seem appropriate on this 
first day that we welcome as many as we can bush said after 
spending his first night at the white house 
the doors opened at 8 am to about 400 people who had waited 
through the night outside in temperatures that dropped to the 20s 
it was the first open house at the white house in 80 years 
and organizers had expressed concern that the crowd touring the 
building would be more restrained than when andrew jackson invited 
celebrators into the white house at his first inauguration in 1829 
and they all but trashed the place 
those allowed inside went through the usual security checks and 
once they got in the presidential mansion they were jovial but 
still shivering from the cold they had endured 
first lady barbara bush joked about how early the tourists had to 
come to be the ones selected for the personalized tour saying 
they saw us come in last night 
the bushes had spent friday night stopping in at each of the 
galas held to celebrate the inauguration and had not gotten back to 
the white house until 1245 am 
asked about her first night in the new home mrs bush said it 
was comfortable but too short 
as bush began his first full day as president former president 
reagan was back in his home state of california where he and wife 
nancy were settling into their new home in bel air near los angeles 
speaking with reporters en route to california reagan called the 
transfer of power a bittersweet experience 
it was hard to say goodbye he said but he added that he was 
returning to a life we did love very much 
bush was equally nostalgic about taking over from the man he had 
served as vice president for two terms i was trying to keep the 
tears from running down my cheeks after eight years of friendship 
it was pretty tough bush said 
the bushes made the round of blacktie invitationonly inaugural 
balls into the night sixtythousand republican party faithful 
thronged from union station to the kennedy center on the banks of 
the moonlit potomac for a night of dancing and carousing 
at union station the bushes took a turn on the dance floor with 
the president joking you saw it first here a lousy dancer 
trying to dance his first dance with the first lady of the united 
states of america 
more partying was store for this evening including a glitzy 
black tie and boots reception thrown by the texas society then 
a lessformal dance party featuring performances by rock n roll 
and blues stars 
but amid the festivities there was a grim reminder of the 
responsibilities that now rest squarely on bushs shoulders from 
the moment he was sworn in a military aide was on call with a 
satchel containing the codes necessary to launch a us nuclear 
attack the satchel which went to the capitol with reagan and left 
with bush is never far away from the president 
bushs chief of staff john sununu said bush today would begin 
the routine of being president with a national security 
briefing and then would get in some paperwork 
nothing exciting but certainly the important daytoday 
routine sununu said 
he said bush also would contact some of his cabinet nominees but 
that a formal cabinet meeting is not scheduled until early next 
week the new president plans to conduct some work on sunday as 
well sununu said 
bush and vice president dan quayle took their oaths of office at 
midday friday under a partly cloudy sky at the west front of the 
capitol in a ceremony watched by 200000 people on the capitol 
grounds and by millions more who saw it on television 
bush delivered a 20minute inaugural address that was marked more 
by lofty calls for national unity than for specific proposals 
a new breeze is blowing and a nation refreshed by freedom 
stands ready to push on there is new ground to be broken and new 
action to be taken bush declared 
in his vow to devote new attention to the homeless the 
disadvantaged the forgotten and the drugaddicted bush also made 
an appeal for political reality in an era of 100 billionplus 
deficits we have more wallet than will but will is what we 
needed he said 
the republican president held out a symbolic hand to leaders of 
the democraticcontrolled congress urging compromise because 
americans did not send us here to bicker 
in his first official act as president bush signed the 
nominations of his cabinet and other toplevel members of his infant 
administration as well as a proclamation designating sunday as a 
national day of prayer and thanksgiving 
bush then went the 16 miles down pennsylvania avenue to the 
white house for the first time as chief executive riding some of 
the way and walking some of the way handinhand with barbara at 
the head of his inaugural parade 
thousands of onlookers lined the route including dean brundage 
and marcia little of suburban fairfax va who rode horses into the 
city and were rewarded with an unobstructed view you have to be 
an nba center to see over this crowd brundage said 
despite the months of preparation bush showed some signs of 
still adjusting to his new status at one point during his 
triumphant day as he was bidding a final farewell to reagan 
barbara bush had to nudge him to remind him that from now he is the 
one who answers to mr president

radio stations broadcast the news 40 years ago 
sunday to anxious beijing residents the citys nationalist 
officials had surrendered peacefully and a long communist siege was 
over 
she diqing now 71 remembers the day well the announcement 
meant his imminent release from jail in beijing for his underground 
communist work 
historian wang huilin is less sure of the dates but remembers 
clearly getting the news he and friends then students ran into 
the streets and sang songs of celebration 
from a military standpoint beijings surrender jan 22 1949 was 
anticlimactic after more than three years of civil war the rest of 
northeastern china already was in communist hands communist troops 
had surrounded the ancient walled city since dec 13 
gen fu zuoyi beijings nationalist commander had no line of 
retreat and no chance of relief from nationalist leader chiang 
kaisheks forces in the south 
for beijings 2 million residents the surrender meant the end to 
waiting and wondering whether the proud fu one of the nationalists 
most able generals would choose to make a stand 
it was a very dismal difficult time we never knew whether 
there would be violence or not derek bodde professor emeritus of 
oriental studies at the university of pennsylvania said in a 
telephone interview bodde was in beijing during the siege busy 
translating a history of chinese philosophy and remembers filling 
his bathtub with water each day because water supplies often were 
cut 
wang who in 1949 was a student at beijing normal university and 
now teaches history there remembers food supplies also were tight 
classes went on as usual but everyone wanted a peaceful 
surrender aside from the possible loss of life beijing held so 
many ancient relics that would have been destroyed in a battle he 
said 
the relics were part of beijings mystique as chinas capital for 
centuries the nationalists made their capital in nanking to the 
south but the communists planned to restore beijings status and 
did not want to destroy the city first 
beijing city officials have commemorated the fateful weeks in 
1949 by issuing three books of photographs reminiscences and 
documents 
she now retired from a top position in beijings postwar 
government and a contributor to the books recalled his work as an 
underground communist organizer 
even before the siege began he said he sent envoys to persuade 
fu to surrender starting with fus daughter a member of the 
procommunist democratic youth alliance that she headed 
we feared that if we picked someone else to talk to fu he 
might be angry and kill the messenger she said but we figured

occasional cannon volleys

despite scattered violence millions of 
people voted in three federallyruled states today in balloting that 
tested prime minister rajiv gandhis popularity before national 
elections later this year 
officials suspended the voting in the state of nagaland after 
clashes between rival groups left three people injured election 
officials said 
authorities also reported minor clashes but no casualties in 
populous tamil nadu an especially important state for gandhis 
fortures 
nevertheless election officials reported heavy turnout in all 
three states after eight hours of voting for state assemblies came 
to a close 
the voting will lead to a restoration of local rule 
an estimated 75 percent of 600000 eligible voters in nagaland 
and about 75 percent of 300000 eligible voters in mizoram state 
cast ballots an estimated 55 percent of 36 million eligible voters 
in tamil nadu went to the polls the officials said results were 
expected to be released sunday 
the federal government imposed its own rule last year after 
political crises in mizoram and nagaland sparsely populated 
northeastern states and tamil nadu in the south 
indian law allows the federal government to dismiss a state 
government and impose its control if there is no clear majority in 
the legislature a state may be kept under federal rule up to one 
year 
todays state assembly elections also were important for gandhi 
and his governing congress party gandhi made nine trips across 
tamil nadu since september in an uphill battle to win a victory for 
his party 
gandhi who must call national parliamentary elections by 
december has been considering early elections if his party wins in 
tamil nadu 
a loss however could rule out such a move and give the 
newlyformed opposition peoples party nearly a year to organize 
the new party is a coalition trying to unite behind vp singh a 
former gandhi ally who is planning to challenge the prime minister 
in the general election 
the congress party which has enjoyed almost uninterrupted 
control of india in the 41 years since independence has not held 
power in tamil nadu since 1967 preelection opinion polls showed 
the congress party trailing muthuvel karunanidhi and his dravida 
munnetra kazhagam party which was expected to win about 120 of the 
234 state assembly seats karunanidhi is backed by singh 
karunanidhi served as tamil nadu chief minister from 1967 to 1976 
when he lost to mg ramachandran a popular actor who turned to 
politics 
the indian constitution says the leader of the largest party 
should become prime minister if he is not already sitting in the 
legislature he must seek election within six months 
ramachandran ruled tamil nadu for 10 years until he died in 
december 1987 his death split his oncemassive party into two 
factions one led by 64yearold wife janaki and the other by his 
leading lady on and off screen jayalalitha jayaram 
ms jayaram 42 claims the late chief minister secretly married 
her and insists she is his political heir she made the claim of the 
secret marriage after ramachandran died 
gandhis party has not designated anyone to be chief minister if 
it wins 
sixty seats were at stake in nagaland a remote hilly state 
bordering china forty seats were being contested in mizoram both 
states have a history of insurgency and tribal unrest

pork rinds theyre loaded with cholesterol 
salt and fat but they crunch pleasingly and explode on the palate 
with delight before dissolving into a light baconflavored residue 
and president bush loves them 
he was introduced to the crispy tan strips during his days as an 
oilman in west texas after a tough day in the oil fields pork 
rinds washed down with a cold beer seems like a food of kings or 
of presidents 
so when bush left texas for the political wars of washington he 
carried with him a continuing yen for them 
but a diet laced with pork rinds say nutrition experts is bad 
news for a guy with a job like george bushs 
this is an appropriate snack for somebody who is doing a lot of 
manual labor an agricultural worker a guy working on the chain 
gang or building railroads said dr wayne callaway an associate 
clinical professor of nutrition at george washington university 
where they are burning up to 4000 calories a day and sweating a 
lot this would be fine 
how about an executive who spends most of his time at the desk 
as a general snack its not a good idea he said in a recent 
interview i think once a year would be fine 
according to a us department of agriculture analysis a 
twoounce package of pork rinds contains 315 calories 325 grams of 
protein 189 grams of fat 58 milligrams of cholesterol and 1054 
milligrams of sodium 
in effect a small package of the hog chips has 20 percent more 
calories almost twice the fat and double the sodium of a typical 
fastfood hamburger but the snack also has almost three times more 
protein than the burger 
the fat cholesterol and sodium says callaway make pork rinds 
an unhealthy addition to a typical american diet that already is 
high in those elements he said jelly beans the treat preferred by 
former president reagan are a much more healthy snack 
on the other hand callaway added if mr bush had a 
cholesterol of 165 and was otherwise healthy and was eating this 
stuff all day long then i wouldnt make a big to do about it 
according to his staff president bushs cholesterol count is 192 
well above the pork rind safety limit suggested by callaway 
bush is so fond of the fried pig skin that in his primary 
campaign last april he stopped in lima ohio and met with the 
president of rudolph foods co one of the nations top pork rind 
processors 
he said he learned about pork rinds in texas said john e 
rudolph the food company president he told me i eat the heck 
out of these things 
but the president is not alone in his craving for fried hog hide 
pork rinds are a 200 million part of the 6 billion snack food 
market said rudolph theyre just a little less popular than 
pretzels but theyre crawling ahead by 4 to 5 percent a year 
rudolphs company produces both the finished product and the 
partiallyprepared pellet that other companies pop into the 
snack food 
rudolph believes pork rinds originated decades ago in mexico he 
and his company modernized the technique and spent the last 33 years 
trying to sell the product to a skeptical world 
pork rinds start with raw fresh hog hides delivered to the lima 
plant the skins are cut into oneinch squares and smokecured like 
bacon then they are rendered a process that extracts grease and 
moisture and shrivels the strips into hard kernels called 
pellets 
to pop the pellets into the final porcine delicacy they are 
placed into oil heated to 400 degrees and deep fried finally the 
rinds are salted generously and packaged usually in twoounce 
snack bags

nearly a decade and a half after richard m 
nixon a distraught former president beset by the past flew home to 
california another former president has followed in his path 
serene popular and proclaiming that he looks to the future as he 
nears his 78th birthday 
the contrasts between nixon and ronald reagan were inescapable as 
reagan flew west after george bushs inauguration friday reagan 
left washington declaring that it was very pleasant living in 
the white house but there are a lot of things yet to be done 
outside of it 
nixon driven to resignation by the watergate scandal took off 
by helicopter from the south lawn of the white house on aug 9 
1974 and was aboard an air force jet to his native state by the 
time gerald ford was sworn in to succeed him 
reagan whose own administration was plunged into turmoil by the 
irancontra affair he professes not yet to understand sat by 
benignly on the capitols western porch as bush took the oath of 
office then he boarded a helicopter for the eightminute flight to 
andrews air force base and the same jet trip west 
nixon born and raised in california called his departure from 
washington the nightmare ending of a long dream 
reagan a midwesterner who adopted california as his home said 
the journey back there for him and former first lady nancy reagan 
was a return to a life we did love very much 
nixon went to an exile of seclusion and silence first in 
california then in new york then in new jersey only recently 
emerging to proclaim his views in books articles and public 
appearances 
reagan said he will quickly be out on the mash potato circuit 
pushing his proposals for budgetary and electoral reform 
asked what he would miss most about washington he said i 
havent tried thinking about that it was very pleasant living 
there 
as to what they would like most about their new life he said 
well because it will be a return to a life we did love very much 
california isnt a place in my mind its a way of life so that is 
the sweet part of the bittersweet experience 
reagan often conferred with nixon while in office and once said 
that as fellow californians they had a closer bond than he 
enjoyed with former presidents carter or ford 
nevertheless the two mens attitudes toward past and future seem 
to differ greatly 
nixon 61 when he left office asked diplomat vernon walters some 
months later what did i do wrong 
if there is any such soul searching in reagan he does not show 
it 
the circumstances of his departure as the first president since 
dwight eisenhower to complete two terms are of course immeasurably 
happier 
still the stark contrasts stand out in his farewell to his 
staff in the east room nixon said always remember others may 
hate you but those who hate you dont win unless you hate them 
in reagans east room farewell as in nixons there were tears 
aplenty but no talk of hate 
on his helicopter flight to andrews nixon leaned his head back 
against his seat back and closed his eyes and heard his wife pat 
murmur its so sad its so sad 
reagan asked as he jetted back west if he was sad happy or 
relieved replied there are elements of all that yes

ted bundys grisly sex crimes 11 years 
ago galvanized support for the death penalty in florida and left 
their mark on the political landscape 
therell be a celebration when he dies said gerald witt 
mayor of the north florida community of lake city home of bundys 
final victim 12yearold kimberly leach he has such a terrible 
criminal record its just impossible to have any sympathy for him 
although bundys scheduled execution tuesday is for kimberlys 
1978 murder he also received a death sentence for strangling two 
students in their beds in a 1978 rampage at a florida state 
university sorority house in tallahassee two other women were 
critically injured 
the law school dropout also was suspected in the sexrelated 
deaths of up to three dozen women in washington idaho oregon utah 
and colorado 
as his execution date approached bundy began confessing to some 
of those slayings said a prosecutor who befriended him murders 
are being solved volusia county state attorney john tanner told 
the orlando sentinel late friday 
at a 1987 competency hearing us district judge kendall sharp 
called bundy probably the most competent serial killer in the 
country at this time a diabolical genius 
this is not one of those cases where death penalty opponents 
are going to have much luck rallying public sympathy to their 
cause said jon peck spokesman for republican gov bob martinez 
we have not heard from amnesty international for a change 
bundy became part of the states 1986 gubernatorial race when a 
hardhitting television commercial for martinez said democrat steve 
pajcic voted to weaken the death penalty for killers like ted 
bundy 
although some found the commercial distasteful its effects were 
devastating to pajcic who lost the election largely on the 
lawandorder issue 
it is an issue that resonates very deeply in this state 
steven craig a political science professor at the university of 
florida said during the campaign everybody knows who ted bundy 
is 
political experts generally agreed that democrat michael dukakis 
presidential aspirations also were crippled in florida by his 
opposition to the death penalty dukakis received just 38 percent of 
the florida vote in november 
state officials and death penalty supporters complain that bundy 
escaped three earlier death warrants through legal maneuverings 
on one of those occasions bundy 42 whose case was depicted in 
the tv miniseries the deliberate stranger came within seven 
hours of execution nov 17 1986 before a federal appeals court 
ordered a competency hearing 
that man has been living off the taxpayers for 10 11 years 
and it reflects badly on the judicial system the mayor said 
people begin to wonder if there is such a thing as criminal 
justice any longer because of so many postponements 
when the legislature passed a law in 1986 requiring automobile 
passengers to buckle their seat belts hordes of bumper stickers 
appeared that read ill buckle up when bundy does its the 
law 
it makes a mockery of our judicial system every day that ted 
bundy continues to live said state attorney jerry blair who won 
a conviction in the leach case people are virtually up in arms 
about this and every day that justice is delayed justice is either 
denied or at least diminished 
nineteen people have been executed in florida since the death 
penalty was restored in 1976 but none has attracted as much 
attention as bundy 
hundreds of calls have poured in from editors and reporters from 
around the country who want to cover the execution the department 
of corrections has received scores of calls from people hoping to 
land one of a dozen seats available to the public for witnessing the 
execution 
weve had an average of 30 calls a day from people wanting to 
be witnesses said carrie flack an administrative assistant 
there is no comparison we normally get three or four requests on 
an individual inmate normally from law enforcement

the state department is refusing to unseal a 
26yearold correspondence between president kennedy and soviet 
leader nikita khrushchev concerning the cuban missile crisis 
despite requests from scholars who say officials in moscow are 
thrilled by the idea 
the 11 classified letters exchanged in 1962 following the cuban 
confrontation remain extremely sensitive from the national 
security point of view said pratt byrd of the departments 
freedom of information office 
scholars had hoped for the release of the letters in time for a 
conference in moscow next weekend featuring for the first time and 
most likely the last missile crisis participants from the united 
states cuba and the soviet union 
therell never be a group able to discuss these letters like 
this group ever again scholar james g blight said in a telephone 
interview last week 
some of the coauthors of these letters will be in the room 
said blight assistant director of the center for science and 
international affairs at harvards john f kennedy school of 
government 
he said scholars are anxious to learn what was said so often 
and so deeply felt because this was supposed to be regarded by both 
men as absolutely private 
the missile crisis flared in october 1962 when an american u2 
spy plane spotted construction of soviet mediumrange ballistic 
missile sites in cuba kennedy responded with a naval blockade 
many believe the confrontation brought the superpowers to the 
brink of war it ended when khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles 
in exchange for us guarantees that cuba would not be invaded 
blight who recently published a book on the missile crisis and 
helped set up the moscow conference said soviet leaders were 
enthusiastic about the idea of releasing the letters 
the soviets were thrilled by this idea blight said mikhail 
gorbachev absolutely would have gone along with it he said 
theres no doubt in my mind 
aleksander alekseev soviet ambassador to cuba at the time of the 
crisis urged kremlin leaders to allow release of the letters other 
people very close to gorbachev and the central committee also 
embraced the idea he said 
but blight said the soviets would not release the correspondence 
without the state department approval 
the john f kennedy library in boston spurred by researchers at 
the kennedy school who helped set up the moscow conference 
requested in november that all 11 documents be reviewed for release 
previous requests by the library on behalf of individual scholars 
have been rejected 
the state department has not announced its decision to the school 
or library but byrd said secretary of state george shultz told sen 
edward m kennedy dmass in a letter and a telephone conversation 
last month that the documents would remain sealed kennedy had been 
working on behalf of the school to have the documents declassified 
kennedy aide paul donovan said discussions between shultz and the 
senator were private and that kennedy would not release his 
correspondence with the secretary of state 
the world leaders exchanged 22 letters between oct 22 and dec 
14 concerning the missile crisis according to suzanne forbes an 
archivist at the kennedy library in boston 
ten of the letters were declassified in 1973 by the state 
department and the 11th was released in 1979 she said the 
remaining letters written by both men from oct 30 through dec 14 
have remained sealed at the boston library despite periodic requests 
by the library on behalf of scholars to have them released 
blight expressed skepticism about the national security 
reason for keeping the letters classified 
the americans who saw it at the time say theres nothing 
embarrassing and poses no national security risks said blight 
he said the reason may be that world leaders may be reluctant to 
have frank correspondence if they fear the documents might be 
released later 
blight also suggested that the state department may fear setting 
a precedent 
rather than the missile crisis correspondence being the 
problem it would be the precedent of opening up sensitive material 
related to the uscubansoviet relationship as a continuing 
problem he said

president bush getting swiftly down to work 
sent a fresh signal today to the powers holding nine americans 
captive in the middle east suggesting that the hostages release 
would engender a comparable act of good will from the united states 
the new president greeted tourists visiting the white house sent 
a letter to congress asking to address a joint session on feb 9 
welcomed a letter of congratulations from the kremlin and met with 
reporters during his first visit to the oval office 
with his mother dorothy prescott bush seated at his side bush 
said he hoped a plea for assistance in the hostage matter in his 
inaugural speech was heard around the world 
i want to make clear to them that good will begets good will 
he said when asked whether he was extending an olive branch to the 
hostageholders 
his comment echoed what he said friday in his inaugural address 
in a clear appeal to iran for help there are today americans who 
are held against their will in foreign lands and americans who are 
unaccoaunted for assistance can be shown here and will be long 
remembered good will begets good will good faith can be a spiral 
that endlessly moves on 
at the same time bush said the united states will not make 
concessions in an effort to free the us hostages some held for 
nearly four years 
refusing to indicate that any middle east nation was responsible 
for holding the hostages bush said we keep hearing rumors that 
countries want to have improved relations with the united states 
but you cant finger any one country for holding hostages agaisnt 
their will 
he added we are not going to escalate the currency of holding 
americans hostage we are not going to have people feel that we are 
going to make concessions in order to free those precious lives 
bush said he planned to respond to a generous letter from 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the gorbachev letter was handed to bush on capitol hill shortly 
after his swearingin ceremony in it the soviet leader told bush 
that the two superpowers have a chance to bring closer the 
solution of the most painful problems of the present time above all 
those connected with the need to eliminate the threat of war 
gorbachev congratulated bush on his new job and said he hoped 
that bushs tenure will be marked by the stable and diverse 
development of relations between our countries and added that the 
soviet union is prepared to work in this direction 
later in the morning bush sent a letter to the bipartisan 
leadership of congress inviting them to meet with him tuesday at 
the white house to discuss the nations deficit and its foreign 
policy he asked for the opportunity to address a joint session of 
the congress on thursday feb 9 
let me say how much i look forward to our working together on 
these critical issues bush wrote according to a text released by 
the white house i am sure the american people expect that 
conserns of such national import should be tackled in a spirit of 
bipartisan cooperation and am hopeful that we may prove worthy of 
the confidence they place in us 
asked for his reaction to being in the oval office for the first 
time bush grinned and said its wonderful i cant wait to get 
to work i really feels wonderful 
bush also read the note that reagan had left him for in his oval 
office desk handwritten on a notepad with the inscription dont 
let the turkeys get you down 
youll have moments when youll want to use this particular 
stationary well go to it bush quoted reagan as writing 
bush also marked his first full day in office by welcoming 
america to the peoples house opening the grounds of the white 
house and leading a tour for a few of the many who were waiting in 
the icy morning chill 
the president with first lady barbara bush at his side came 
outside below the south porch of the white house not usually a 
tourist entrance to welcome about 400 people waiting for a free 
public tour of the presidential mansion 
this is the peoples house and it does seem appropriate on this 
first day that we welcome as many as we can bush said 
while thousands more people waited their turns to enter the white 
house grounds a randomly selected group of about 15 visitors was 
personally escorted by bush on a tour of the historic house 
bush left the tour saying he had to begin some presidential 
paperwork to sign one or two things 
dozens of people waited outside the white house grounds most of 
the night for the public tour which came after the bushes had a 
busy evening of inaugural ballhopping 
bush took the oath of office at noon friday in a chilly ceremony 
watched by 200000 on capitol hill and by millions of television 
viewers around the world 
bush was also attending a lunch at the state department honoring 
the finance committee that raised more than 25 million for these 
inaugural festivities and was heading out again tonight to a texas 
black tie and boots party and another affair for young americans 
bush who has often joked that he has martin van buren to thank 
for his example of being the last vice president elected directly to 
the presidency may have van buren to blame for the black tie ordeal 
he endured friday night 
van buren in 1837 became the first chief executive to hold two 
inaugural balls and he offended supporters by only attending the 
higherpriced affair since then no president has passed up any 
official ball even as they mushroomed from five in john f 
kennedys time to nine at ronald reagans second inauguration 
this time there were 11 official balls with separate overflow 
balls at three sites and a stop at a congressional medal of honor 
winners banquet making 15 stops in all for bush 
bush made no bones that dancing is not his favorite pastime 
bush who began the eventful day by rising at 6 am in blair 
house didnt get home to the white house until 1245 am more 
than 4 hours after he and barbara began the party rounds they 
danced cheektocheek at five balls but although the bands played 
i could have danced all night they never did more than a few 
turns

west germanys diplomatic staff left 
kabul on saturday under orders from the bonn government and tass 
said the soviet union began an airlift of emergency food supplies to 
this beleaguered capital 
the west german foreign ministry said it told its three diplomats 
in kabul to leave because of fears of worsening economic conditions 
and increased violence as soviet soldiers leave afghanistan and its 
civil war 
juergen chrobog chief ministry spokesman said the diplomats and 
their families left the city saturday he said the embassy would 
function on a reduced status with a small local staff 
western diplomatic sources in kabul however said the embassy 
was closed that would make it the first foreign mission in kabul to 
shut down amid concerns about an economic blockade and possible 
blood bath following the red armys departure 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the west 
germans left on a flight for new delhi with no prior announcement 
we intend to watch developments there carefully before making a 
decision on when to return chrobog said 
other western embassies say they are reviewing their positions 
now that it appears the soviets will meet a feb 15 deadline for 
removal of their troops from afghanistan where they have been 
helping government troops fight moslem guerrillas since december 
1979 
the british embassy last week told britons and nationals of six 
other countries for which it has diplomatic responsibility to leave 
the us embassy has 11 american staff members in kabul and says the 
question of whether to stay is under constant review 
kabul has been increasingly tense as the withdrawal date for the 
remaining 50000 soviet soldiers approaches and guerrillas close in 
food prices have doubled in recent weeks civilians including young 
children stand in bread lines for hours in 20degree temperatures 
guerrilla disruptions of convoys of food and supplies including 
ammunition have increased as soviet troops hand over escort duties 
and positions to government units along the key salang highway from 
the soviet border bad weather also has held up convoys 
saturdays englishlanguage tass report mentioned significant 
shortages because of the effort by the unreconcilable opposition 
guerrillas to organize an economic blockade of the city it 
accused some kabul traders of engaging in open sabotage by 
hoarding food 
the official soviet news agency reported from kabul that a 
3500ton airlift of food began friday tass said six flights 
arrived saturday in kabul with flour and other food supplies 
un aid officials welcomed the reported airlift and urged 
similar help from western nations which refuse to deal with the 
promarxist government of president najib 
were very pleased this is a beginning said vincent 
oreilly head of unicef in kabul 
weve heard reports of children dying from cold in the bread 
queues and were very concerned about the dangers of increased 
malnutrition this is a humanitarian not a political issue and 
the west should help too

british officials frequently expressed alarm at 
their security forces behavior during an arab rebellion in 
palestine 50 years ago but they did little to curb the excesses 
newly declassified documents show 
the independent newspaper which sifted through the government 
files said saturday they showed ministers refused to curb the 
atrocities and excesses the very charge now leveled against 
israel by the present british government 
a foreign office spokesman said he did not expect the department 
to comment because that is history and its for the historians to 
decide 
one tactic was to force arab cabdrivers to ride at the head of 
british convoys in case the road was mined the independent said 
a note from sir john shuckburgh a senior government official at 
the time was quoted as likening conditions in palestine to what the 
british faced against irish rebels 20 years earlier 
we have to deal not with a chivalrous opponent playing the game 
according to the rules but with gangsters and murderers 
shuckburgh wrote 
this followed the assassination of a british official in the town 
of jenin and the shooting death of the suspected assassin allegedly 
as he tried to escape after being arrested 
a heavily armed convoy set out for jenin in what is now the 
israelioccupied west bank carrying 9300 pounds of the explosive 
gelignite and orders that a large portion of the town should be 
blown up according to a commanders report dated sept 5 1938 
demolishing homes is one of the penalties israel has used during 
the 13monthold palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories 
it inherited this and other tactics from the british who ruled 
palestine from 1917 until israel won statehood in 1948 
what particularly alarmed london the independent said was 
security forces use of minesweeping taxis 
known troublemakers owned the taxis which were commandeered with 
their drivers and put at the heads of convoys the papers said 
lord dufferin of ava parliamentary undersecretary at the 
colonial office wrote much as i dislike the implications of the 
minesweeping taxi i do not feel that we have the right to 
interfere british lives are being lost and i dont think we from 
the security of whitehall can protest squeamishly about measures 
taken by the men in the front line 
lets close our eyes he recommended to the government in a 
letter endorsed by other officials 
a letter to the colonial office from the british high 
commissioner in jerusalem sir harold macmichael shared a concern 
that the british were using black and tan tactics a reference 
to atrocities committed by the black and tan units of british 
military police in ireland in 1920 and 1921 
one recognizes that when men see their friends and comrades 
blown into pieces by a land mine they are apt to see red he 
wrote but there are limits which must not be passed 
the independent said the papers contain no evidence of firm 
government action to demand discipline and adherence to publicly 
stated orders 
many of the documents should have been made public in 1969 but 
were withheld for an additional 20 years because of their 
sensitivity the independent said

george bush begins his presidency awash in 
political good will for the moment but strapped in the long run by 
the legacy of debt from the reagan administration the trick is to 
jump start his term without any money 
bush has been trying to dampen expectations of a dazzling new 
start perhaps hoping to insure that any early achievements seem 
larger than life 
dismissing the notion of a dramatic first 100 days bush said in 
an inaugurationeve interview im not shooting for any 100 days 
and i think its kind of a concept that doesnt really apply 
bush is guaranteed of making a splash though just by comparison 
with the way ronald reagan did things there will be plenty of 
differences to highlight many of them that will depict bush as a 
busy handson manager in contrast to reagans laidback style 
a late sleeper reagan never got to work before 9 am on his 
first day bush was on the move at 8 am leading a tour of the 
white house for selected tourists on regular work days bush is 
expected to be in the oval office between 7 am and 730 am 
in public and private appearances reagan relied heavily on 
prepared scripts and talking points written on file cards bush 
is more comfortable speaking off the cuff though he too depends 
on speech writers to write formal remarks 
where reagans schedule was carefully choreographed bush is 
spontaneous and often unpredictable while reagan consented to 
always be accompanied by the press bush said he wont wait around 
for reporters and will come and go as he pleases you just dont 
want to be totally isolated he said 
there will be a big emphasis on family and children in the bush 
white house he has four grown sons and a daughter and 10 
grandchildren who will be frequent visitors 
in contrast reagan and his wife nancy were often estranged from 
their family 
while reagan was not fond of traveling overseas bush loves it 
making 40 separate foreign trips and visiting 74 nations since 1981 
hell go to tokyo for the feb 24 funeral of emperor hirohito and 
has not ruled out other stops on that trip a nato summit in 
brussels is likely in april and an economic summit in paris is set 
for july 
as reagan flew into retirement on friday he acknowledged i 
think there are a lot of things yet to be done certainly a 
change with regard to the abortion situation i couldnt get that 
done yet he also mentioned his futile efforts to get authority 
for lineitem vetoes on the budget and to win passage of a 
constitutional amendment for a balanced budget 
for bush the realities of the deficit loom over everything else 
on the domestic agenda 
on monday bush will have his first cabinet meeting and the 
budget is sure to be topic a on tuesday he wants to meet at the 
white house with the bipartisan leadership of congress to open talks 
on the 150 billion budget deficit bequeathed by ronald reagan on 
feb 9 he will address a joint session of congress to announce his 
budget priorities 
for now at least congressional democrats are treating bush 
warmly bush is extending the hand of friendship and we intend to 
extend ours in return said senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine 
former house speaker thomas tip oneill who led the 
democrats budget battles with reagan exulted its the dawn of a 
new era were back to normalcy in the white house how delighted i 
am 
no one expects the honeymoon with a democratic congress to last 
forever and some think it will end sooner than later the hill is 
stacked against them it will give this administration little or no 
slack said reagans former political adviser mitchell daniels 
the hill will treat this as an extension of the reagan 
administration 
already the deficit has forced bush to scale back on education 
initiatives and other plans our funds are low he said in his 
inaugural address we have a deficit to bring down we have more 
will than wallet but will is what we need 
bush in an interview said well have to sort through and set 
priorities some of what i want to do will have to wait on a 
solution to the budget question 
while bush and his lieutenants are hanging tough polls show that 
a majority of americans doubt that the new president will be able to 
live up to his promise not to raise taxes he has to find billions 
of dollars for the savings and loan industry crisis the cleanup and 
repair of the nations nuclear weapon plants and other costly 
problems 
there also are vexing national security and foreign policy 
problems for the pentagon bush has to decide on a scaleddown 
budget and choose between two strategic weapon systems the mx 
missile or the midgetman he plans to order a major reassessment of 
how to deal with the soviet union on arms control and other areas 
the middle east and central america also demand immediate attention

a shiite moslem cleric said in an 
interview published saturday there are signs british hostages in 
lebanon will be freed soon but that us captives wont go free 
until the united states makes concessions 
president bush said saturday in washington the united states 
would make no concessions to free the hostages we are not going 
to escalate the currency of holding americans hostage he said 
the fundamentalist cleric sheik sadek mousawi said the united 
states should meet iranian conditions for freeing the american 
hostages according to the interview published by the beirut 
magazine annahar arab and international 
the magazine quoted mousawi as saying i would like to assert 
that there are good indications of an imminent release of the 
british hostages as a result of the iranianbritish rapprochement 
britain and iran agreed dec 9 to restore full diplomatic ties 
ending a 19month break that followed the arrest of an iranian 
diplomat in england on shoplifting charges 
three britons are among the 15 foreign hostages in lebanon they 
are anglican church envoy terry waite who disappeared jan 20 
1987 journalist john mccarthy kidnapped april 17 1986 and 
educator brian keenan a dual britishirish national abducted april 
11 1986 
also missing is alec collett a british journalist who was 
working for the un relief and works agency when he disappeared 
march 25 1985 an islamic group claims to have killed him but no 
body was found 
mousawi heads a small group called the islamic movement which 
seeks to set up an islamic republic in lebanon patterned after the 
iranian regime of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
mousawis group is allied with the iranianbacked hezbollah or 
party of god an umbrella organization for proiranian factions 
believed holding most of the hostages 
the magazine quoted mousawi as saying the united states would 
have to make concessions to win freedom for the nine american 
hostages 
if america wants its hostages then it has to respond to the 
iranian demands so that iran would give the advice to the hostage 
holders to free the american hostages he said 
tehran has demanded release of 10 billion in iranian assets 
frozen in the united states as a precondition for its aid in 
releasing the american hostages 
the american captives include terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who is the foreigner held 
longest in lebanon he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
mousawi said iran could exert influence on the captors even 
though the kidnappings were ordered by lebanese personalities 
and carried out by lebanese without intervention from iran 
he added but it is normal for any moslem irrespective of how 
far he is geographically from iran to be influenced by the advice of 
the officials in iran

his inauguration ceremonies friday congratulated him and offered 
hopes for stable and diverse development of relations between our 
countries so important for peace throughout the world 
bush told reporters that he would respond to the letter which he 
characterized as generous pledging world peace he said he 
had received other heartwarming expressions of good will from 
leaders around the world and will respond to them as well

during his first day on the job bush also said the united states 
will not make concessions in an effort to free the us hostages 
held in lebanon he said he hopes his inaugural plea for help from 
other countries on the hostage matter will be heard worldwide 
i want to make clear to them that good will begets good will 
he said 
bush indicated he has several things on his mind as he prepares 
to begin his presidency and said he couldnt wait to get started 
a first formal meeting of his cabinet is set for monday on 
tuesday he will meet with a bipartisan group of congressional 
leaders on the budget deficit and on foreign affairs according to 
chief of staff john sununu 
bush aides have indicated there will be an ethicsingovernment 
package and he is expected to name an advisory commission on ethics 
with that coming within a matter of days according to sununu 
sununu said he expected bush to make a statement to coincide with 
mondays antiabortion demonstration in washington to mark the 
anniversary of the roe v wade supreme court decision legalizing 
abortion 
bush has said he opposes abortion except in cases of rape incest 
or a threat to the life of the mother although in earlier years he 
espoused a more flexible view 
the president sent a letter saturday to congressional leaders 
formally asking to address a joint session of congress on feb 9 
forseeing battles over his vow not to raise taxes bush 
acknowledged many on capitol hill wont accept some of the 
fundamental premises on which i was elected 
im not expecting miracles but i want them to know we are 
going to try he said in remarks to a group of republican 
financial backers saturday afternoon 
earlier bush told reporters that despite his overtures to 
congress he also has concerns about the erosion of presidential 
power in which the house and senate often are able to thwart 
presidential initiatives 
he said he wants to discuss that with members of congress how 
to reestablish in the presidency the firm hand that i think the 
constitution gave the president 
regarding the hostages he said we keep hearing rumors that 
countries want to have improved relations with the united states 
but you cant finger any one country for holding hostages against 
their will 
we are not going to escalate the currency of holding americans 
hostage we are not going to have people feel that we are going to 
make concessions in order to free those precious lives bush said 
bush displayed an upbeat and eager demeanor saturday the day 
after he was sworn in as the 41st president

reporters in the oval office i couldnt wait to come over here

of the public to tour the white house personally taking a group of 
about two dozen of the first arrivals through the mansions public 
rooms

cia director william webster and national security adviser brent

president bush admitted saturday with a 
sheepish grin that he got lost wandering around on his first night 
in the white house but vowed to get to work serious work on 
his first day in the oval office 
i couldnt wait to get in here its wonderful said bush 
seated before a crackling fire with his mother dorothy prescott 
bush by his side 
oh i think its the most exciting day of my life so far 
said mrs bush who was seated in the traditional chair reserved for 
visiting heads of state and dignitaries when they visit the 
president 
from around 8 am when bush popped his head out of a 
secondfloor window to wave to tourists the new president started a 
first day that had its hectic moments several dozen inaugural week 
visitors toured the mansions ceremonial rooms and caused more 
commotion than the white house has seen in years 
bush clad in a suit and sweater against the january chill led 
several dozen members of his family on an impromptu tour of the 
south lawn and tennis court capping the stroll by tossing a 
footfall with his sons 
then the new president joined about 240 of his family members for 
lunch in the east room 
shortly before 9 am bush strolled across the colonnade and 
entered the oval office stealing a few private moments with the 
matriarch of his family 
even at that hour he already had put his stamp on the office 
several pens were neatly arranged on a gilt plate on his desk 
accompanied by a letter holder and a trio of books pictures of bush 
family members in plastic frames crowded the table behind his ornate 
wooden desk 
as he chatted amiably with reporters the president sipped coffee 
from a green and gold cup emblazoned with the eagle of the 
presidential seal 
a somber portrait of george washington in full dress uniform 
looked down upon the nations 41st president a dark bronze bust of 
teddy roosevelt played sentry by a side door

it feels just fine noting that his large family was settling 
in after the glamor and excitement of the inauguration 
i cant wait to get to work serious work and were going 
to do some here today bush said he said he has a good full 
schedule for next week 
i got lost in the white house yesterday evening when we came 
in trying to find a couple of kids rooms bush admitted when 
asked about his first night in the mansion 
as his mother beamed bush reached over and patted her on the 
knee this is the one who told me not to brag about myself and to 
bend my knees when i volleyed bush cracked 
the president said he began his day around 6 am caring for a 
sick grandchild nancy ellis leblond and that the recovery was 
rapid pumped a half a tylenol into her and shes looking good 
ate two pancakes 
asked about the note president reagan left for him on friday 
before leaving the office bush told an aide to pull it from the 
desk drawer 
holding high a notepad with the inscription dont let the 
turkeys get you down bush showed reporters how reagan had written 
his successor hed have moments when youll want to use this 
particular stationary well go to it 
youll be in my prayers god bless you and barbara ill miss 
our thursday lunches bush quoted reagan as saying in the note 
bush also touched on matters of policy ranging from ussoviet 
relations to relations with congress 
he told reporters that the united states will stay strong and 
that occasionally presidents are called upon to use force this 
president will be no different he vowed 
he went on to muse about the limits of presidential power and 
said he intended to work with congress not only to avoid the 
erosion of power but to reestablish the firm hand that i think 
the constitution gave the president 
bush who has vowed not to answer questions in the socalled 
photo opportunities set up by the white house insisted that his 
17minute session with reporters and photographers is not a phot 
op 
i love it when its tranquil and peaceful like this bush

president bush opened the white house doors 
saturday to a band of shivering pilgrims some in tuxedos and 
others wrapped in quilts who had waited outside all night for a 
chance to greet him in his new home 
ive been here 11 hours and 30 minutes its cold said kyle 
shadix of atlanta when the white house east gate was finally 
unlocked shortly after 7 am 
cheers and occasional shouts of wheres george came from the 
long line of bundledup people clutching sleeping bags quilts and 
blankets as they streamed into a security area to walk through metal 
detectors 
one of the highlights of the tour is heat secret service 
agent william ludtke joked as the crowd moved out of the 24degree 
chill and into the historic house 
the white house american welcome billed as bushs first official 
act as president and as the first white house open house in 80 
years prompted dozens of people to sleep out overnight to make sure 
they were admitted 
more than 4000 visitors took the free tours as part of the 
threehour open house what made the event different from the 
regular saturday tours was that bush and his wife were on hand to 
greet many of the visitors 
inauguration officials said a new president had not made such a 
planned formal gesture since 1909 
the earliest arrivals showed up at 830 pm friday and the long 
vigil paid off for 15 people chosen to tour the white house with 
bush and his wife barbara 
the president actually stood beside me and nudged me and said 
what do you think of this room said dick nichols 52 of 
baltimorei said its beautiful 
he paused and laughed incredulously i never thought it would 
happen i never thought hed even be there its something ill 
never forget i will never be that close a president again 
it was barely light in the south courtyard of the white house 
when the first visitors were allowed in but the mood was festive 
the truman balcony was hung with red white and blue bunting and a 
us marine band pianist sent cocktail music wafting across the lawn 
college students and senior citizens and parents lugging children 
in snowsuits shouted we love you george as the first couple 
strode out to make brief remarks i know some of you have been up 
all night long bush told about 1500 patient fans we just 
wanted to wish you well and welcome you to the peoples house 
those on the personal tour were a mix of students older people 
and families all among the first to arrive friday night also 
picked was a double amputee in a wheelchair the bushes accompanied 
by a curator led the small group through several ceremonial rooms 
the same ones shown on normal white house tours 
it was just great he was the kindest man i wasnt expecting 
him to get up so early said adam slater of pittsburgh 
slater steven resnick and saul kellner three george washington 
university students earned their presidential tour by being the 
very first in line the president they said was as nice as they 
had expected 
he treated us like we were real people not like rabble 
resnick of scotch plains nj said in amazement what next im 
going to call my parents said kellner of manalapan nj 
the decorous tour was a far cry from andrew jacksons inaugural 
open house in 1829 muddybooted men stepped on chairs and knocked 
over furniture and glassware to get at the refreshments which were 
later moved onto the lawn in hopes the unruly crowd would follow 
jackson ended up cornered by the mob and had to be spirited out the 
back door 
william howard taft held the most recent open house shaking 
visitors hands for hours the day after his inauguration in 1909 
bush and his wife continued that tradition saturday after their 
stint as escorts greeting hundreds more people with handshakes and 
chitchat before leaving for other engagements 
it was well worth not sleeping said claudine fortunato of 
westchester ny hes got a nice firm handshake he really 
does said tom st george of springfield va it wasnt an 
assembly line he looked me in the eye and said thanks for coming 
by it was completely worth waiting for said john donnelly of 
philadelphia 
donnelly was among several men attired in tuxedos telltale 
evidence that they had come straight from friday night inaugural 
balls to camp outside the white house commenting on the phenomenon 
later bush said he had shaken hands with people who had been to 
one of these balls and slept out there 
now what does it take for somebody to stay awake all night to 
come into the white house bush mused what kind of people were 
they they were all different kinds of people the common thread 
was that they felt they were lucky to be there which amazed me in a 
sense because i felt we were so lucky to have people that would care 
that much

a group of homemakers said saturday 
they will protest at government offices because of a shortage of 
goods that has created a wave of panic buying and put the government 
at odds with manufacturers 
theres no coffee toilet paper or detergent there hasnt been 
all week its been crazy said cesar rumbos a supermarket clerk 
in caracas 
he was describing a wave of panic shopping after a group of 
companies announced they would no longer be able to supply the 
market with goods many stores simply closed their doors by weeks 
end unable to stock shelves with items ranging from toothpaste to 
milk 
the government says manufacturers are storing away goods to 
pressure it into increasing import subsidies which have been 
curtailed 
in venezuela the scarcity is false and distorted said 
president jaime lusinchi late friday he blamed manufacturers for 
hoarding and smugglers for taking goods out of the country 
especially to neighboring colombia and the caribbean venezuelan 
products often fetch higher prices there 
the homemakers said they were fed up with both the government and 
manufacturers they announced they would protest this week in front 
of the governments superintendency for consumer protection to 
highlight the scarcity 
the government says theres no problems because they assigned 
the dollars for import subsidies the industrialists say they 
havent gotten them the truth is consumers have lost faith in both 
the government and the industrialists said diana vegas head of a 
neighborhood group 
advertisements placed in local newspapers by a soap maker and a 
paper manufacturer blamed the government for cutting back on the 
subsidies granted to venezuelan companies to import goods 
presidentelect carlos andres perez has warned the program must 
be eliminated in an effort to bolster us dollar reserves which 
are used in the program a slump in prices for oil a major national 
export has contributed to the reserve crisis 
manufacturers and the business community generally welcome the 
reform in the long run however they blame the lusinchi 
administration for the shortfall in reserves that led to the cutback 
in dollars for imports 
theres one reason for the scarcity the government has no 
money to assign us said habib levi a diaper manufacturer he 
said his company panales mammi has cut production in half and 
denied it was hoarding

in an uncertain world ronald reagan stood for 
certainty he was unwavering absolute in his convictions 
especially when changing 
consistency was not a hobgoblin of the reagan white house 
that style not only worked it triumphed the 40th president left 
office on friday with the highest public approval ratings since the 
pollsters started keeping score 
a new york timescbs news poll conducted jan 12 to 15 showed 
that 68 percent approval of reagans job performance thats 9 
points higher than the farewell approval rating of dwight d 
eisenhower and reagan made those numbers count politically he was 
the first president in 60 years to leave office at the inauguration 
of an elected successor of his own party 
for reagan the genius was not in the details but more often in 
avoiding them he made u turns without a signal and usually without 
a problem he campaigned against deficits and tripled them he won 
the biggest tax cut in us history and later quietly signed the 
biggest increase he denounced moscows evil empire then 
fashioned a new closeness with the soviet union under new 
leadership 
a prime exhibit the swollen federal budget deficit 
time and again i have proposed measures to help curb federal 
domestic program spending reagan said in the budget he bequeathed 
to president bush time and again these proposals have been 
rejected by congress 
he said the deficit problem began with the recession that hit 
early in his first term and worsened because he couldnt get half 
the spending curbs he sought by reagans reckoning he hadnt 
changed conditions had so he kept making the deficit speech while 
the deficit soared on his watch 
but in six of the eight reagan budget years the budget passed by 
congress actually was lower than that proposed by the administration 
supplemental appropriations approved after the budget resolution 
was adopted pushed actual spending higher than the reagan budget in 
all but two of those years those additions were the handiwork of 
both congress and the administration 
reagan campaigned in 1980 with a promise to balance the budget 
within a fouryear term the federal debt has nearly tripled to 
26 trillion during his two terms the average deficit was 180 
billion 
with deficits worsening reagan insisted that a balanced budget 
had not been a campaign commitment ive never said anything but 
that it was a goal 
he promised a military buildup and he delivered a 24 trillion 
expansion during his eight years that fed the deficit and the 
struggle over priorities that raged through both his terms 
reagan political challenges stayed the hands of two presidents 
gerald ford and jimmy carter in arms control dealings with moscow 
ford dropped the word detente from his vocabulary while fending 
off reagan in 1976 compared with the reaganera thaw fords 
detente was a chill 
reagans farewell address described a satisfying new closeness 
with the soviet union he and soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
signed the treaty to scrap intermediate range nuclear missiles met 
at the summit five times in three years and fashioned a dramatically 
different relationship between washington and moscow 
reagan said that was possible because this time so far its 
different the soviet union has changed 
reagan changed too but he wasnt given to mentioning it 
when the iran arms sales of 1985 and 1986 were disclosed reagan 
insisted he had not tried to trade arms for hostages 
the record showed otherwise when his own investigating 
commission said so the president acknowledged that what he called 
an attempted opening to iran had deteriorated into arms for hostages 
even then he said my heart and my best intentions still tell 
me it wasnt a trade despite the facts and the evidence soon 
afterward he reverted to the notrade position and stuck with it to 
the end of his term 
for all that reagans years were years of evolution they call 
it the reagan revolution and ill accept that he said but for 
me it always seemed more like the great rediscovery a rediscovery 
of our values and our common sense 
rediscovery or revolution it rewrote the agenda ending an era 
in which government programs multiplied to address each emerging 
problem reagan always said that government was the problem not the 
solution 
he argued that the government shouldnt have more revenue because 
it would only spend the money his parting budget advice was to curb 
deficits by continuing to limit the appetite of government 
a troubling legacy to president bush the deficits reagan rued 
may yet serve the purposes of the reagan revolution limits on 
government are more easily enforced when borrowing is the only way 
to pay the bills

night as he took his wife barbaras hand and moved about the 
platform to the tune of i could have danced all night

first lady was enough for the 5000 that jammed the newlyrestored 
train stations main hall 
they cheered as the first couple walked the deck atop the center 
kiosk and waved above them red white and blue bursts of sparkles 
gold bunting and light blue streamers were hanging from every 
corner outside guests purchased tshirts sweatshirts and other 
souvenirs at a stand equipped with a credit card machine 
among those jostled in the crowd were actor george hamilton 
singers wayne newton and jimmy dean and artist peter max 
david treen governor of louisiana for four years and a us 
congressman for seven years said it was the last inaugural ball he

at the elegant civil war pension building the luminaries 
included cia director william webster senators alan k simpson of 
wyoming and bob dole of kansas and doles wife elizabeth bushs 
designate for secretary of labor 
but perhaps the most photographed person at the ball was ronald 
v knapp 
a gorbachev lookalike complete with an artificial birthmark he 
spent the night laughing and being photographed alongside other 
partygoers ill probably end up in more scrapbooks than anybody 
in washington he said 
maybe he looked too much like the soviet leader webster arrived 
with two bodyguards despite the already tight security 
simpson danced in an impromptu conga line joined by hundreds of 
other celebrants dressed in anything from black tie to scottish 
tartan kilts at a party including states and territories ranging 
from simpsons wyoming to guam and the virgin islands

freeflowing lighthearted affair but things got testy at the 
stripes bash in the other hall 
longtime bush friend lionel hampton entertained the stars 
crowd and the first family was represented by presidential son 
marvin bush and his wife margaret 
i paid a lot for this dress and i wanted you to see it said 
marvin of his wifes navy blue velvet dress as he introduced her to 
the crowd 
washingtons local office holders mostly democrats wondered 
aloud why they had been invited but they were obviously pleased 
it was significantly symbolic that the city was represented by 
its chief of police in the inaugural parade said city council 
member charlene drew jarvis washington has been plagued by a murder 
wave with more slayings per capita than any other us city 
on the other side of the convention center virginia sen john 
warner and former republican senate candidate linda chavez of 
maryland were on hand when tempers got a little testy at the

several people fainted during the sardinecan simulation at the 
kennedy center where 5000 people in a place that maybe could 
accommodate 1500 the crowd was so dense that one woman who fainted 
was kept from falling to the floor no floor space was available 
one woman complained that she had spent all this money on her 
new ball gown and the only place it could be seen was the ladies 
room 
no one could move from shortly after the party began at 8 pm in 
the grand foyer that parallels the potomac river and connects the 
kennedy centers three auditoriums until after george and barbara 
bushs fiveminute visit at 1125 pm 
during the threehour wait for the bushes visit the 
shouldertobosom audience whiled away the time by talking to their 
neighbors the resulting din was such that 
even conversation was difficult and the most effective 
communications award should go to the two women signlanguage users 
who had been stationed on either side of the makeshift stage so 
they could translate bushs comments to the hardofhearing during 
the longwait for the presidential party the two signers chatted 
back and forth across the 50foot stage it was the only way to 
communicate

several thousand young republicans danced shoulder to shoulder to 
the throbbing beat of rock bands and music videos and roared their 
approval for president bush and vice president quayle 
to be included in this is incredible said kerry trost 16 
of fairfax va who got her 30 ticket from a friend 
the crowd of about 3000 at the young americans ball one of two 
for the under30 set really came alive after bush and quayle made 
their appearances 
they chanted usa usa usa as quayle stood on the stage 
thanking the young republicans for their support and promising a 
bright future bush received an even louder welcome 
this is one of the most exciting things ive never seen a 
president or vice president before ruben rodriguez a 
hearingimpaired student at galludet university in washington dc 
signed through an interpreter 
the crowd most of whom were in their 20s was largely white 
although elizabeth smith a washington dc clerk had not expected 
to be in the majority she had not expected to be one of a handful 
of blacks at the party 
i saw very few blacks and the ones i saw were working she 
said 
as many men arrived at the marriott in coat and tie as in 
tuxedos but most of the women wore formal dresses and gowns and 
as susie ostrander of newport beach calif and stacey schlosser of 
washington dc discovered during a break in the womens room 
sometimes the same one 
were good friends now schlosser said after the two posed 
for a picture in their distinctive fulllength gowns of black velvet 
with a layered white taffeta skirt and large white bow on the back

dress and decorum were relaxed at the young americans ball for 
the under30 crowd at the dc armory where ballroom dancing was 
replaced with hard rock wallsized video screens and even a 
bunnyhop line or two 
organizers had tried to soften the cavernous setting with red 
white and blue drapes fringed metallic streamers and flowers but 
it still had a look akin to a high school gymnasium dressed up for 
the prom 
long gowns mixed with short skirts tuxedos alternated with suits 
before the fete had ended the floor was littered with 
stadiumsize budweiser cups beer cans and empty champagne bottles 
young women and occassionally their dates were seen slipping off 
their tootight shoes 
between the appearances of bush and quayle the latter of whom 
looked like he would have fit right in the biggest hit of the night 
was actor ricky schroeder a bevy of squealing girls and clicking 
cameras tracked him around the room 
when the crowds energy started to flag at one point the bus 
boys bass player reminded them they were celebrating the 
inaugural day for a brand new getdown president

it was nearly midnight when bush greeted those gathered at the 
sheraton he and barbara had stopped at their new home to refresh 
themselves for the marathon evening he said 
dont worry about our housing we were at the white house for 
two hours and boy is it something special unbelievable bush 
declared 
eariler quayle and marilyn made the sheraton their first stop of 
the evening 
hey quayle shouted as he took the stage hey the crowd 
intoned back 
this sounds like a good group we might just stick around for 
awhile quayle said to applause 
then a reluctant quayle gave in to an inaugural tradition i 
guess protocol allows you to witness my inability to dance the 
vice president as began a stiff slow spin around the stage

some waited more than five hours for their chance to applaud the 
new president at the washington hilton where bush arrived after his 
appearances at the other 10 official ball sites 
whens he getting here are we really last what time 
did you hear he was coming 
the main ballroom was so jammed that for more than an hour the 
local fire marshals aided at first by boy scouts and later by 
police barred the doors 
you should have heard them they were banging on the doors 
they were shouting they paid all that money for tickets and they 
wanted in said a fire inspector 
it was next to impossible to dance in the human gridlock and 
very difficult to get drinks so many simply marked time with 
politicking and peoplewatching 
a young woman who described herself only as a debutante from 
pittsburgh and washington wore a zebraprint minidress with a 
white ruffled train and was inundated by strangers wanting to take 
her picture 
martha poli of derry pa did her peoplewatching from a carpeted 
corridor where she and two companions cornered a section of the 
floor 
its just too crowded she said were not having fun

president bush said on his first day in the 
oval office saturday he is prepared to respond in kind to any acts 
of good will by those holding americans hostage but will make no 
concessions to free those precious lives 
people in the past facilitated the release of our citizens and 
id love to see that happen again and i wont and i wont forget 
it if it does bush declared 
in a freewheeling exchange with reporters the new president also 
said he intends to meet with congressional leaders tuesday to 
discuss the governments spending deficit and has asked to address 
a joint session of congress feb 9 bush hinted that would be a more 
specific call to action than what he termed a thematic inaugural 
address on friday 
stay tuned feb 9th well have something a little different 
if thats the date thats settled on he said 
after a night of celebration at 11 inaugural balls bush and his 
wife barbara were up early to open the doors of the white house to 
4500 ordinary americans many of whom had stood in line for hours 
in bitter cold for a special tour and a chance to stroll the south 
lawn 
it was the first open house at the executive mansion since 
william howard taft held a public reception 80 years ago but it was 
hardly reminiscent of the most famous such occurrence when 
thousands of tennessee frontiersmen in muddy boots followed andrew 
jackson through the doors in 1829 and virtually trashed the place 
after personally escorting 15 tourists picked at random through 
his new home bush took his place at the oval office desk occupied 
by ronald reagan for the last eight years there he found a 
personal note left behind by his mentor inscribed on jokeshop 
stationery which bore the printed heading dont let the turkeys 
get you down 
beneath it was reagans handwriting dear george youll have 
moments when you want to use this particular stationery well go to 
it george i treasure the memories we share and wish you all the 
very best youll be in my prayers god bless you and barbara ill 
miss our thursday lunches ron 
showing the note to reporters bush said none of those assembled 
should take the turkey reference personally it is a broad 
ecumenical statement he grinned 
with his aging mother dorothy prescott bush seated at his side 
bush took his first presidential news conference question 
q how does it feel to be president 
a it feels just fine its setting in now after the glamour and 
excitement of the inauguration its a great joy to have my mother 
here the leader of our family 
later he declared its the most exciting day of my life so 
far it just is wonderful everythings been perfect everythings 
so beautiful 
bush said too he would soon respond to a generous letter 
from soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in the letter gorbachev told 
bush he hoped his term would bring stable and diverse development 
of relations between our countries and that they could work 
together to eliminate the threat of war 
bushs schedule included an intelligence briefing from national 
security adviser brent scowcroft and chief of staff john sununu an 
appearance at a luncheon for the financial organizers of his 25 
million inaugural and a second night of formal revelry including a 
black tie n boots ball for his fellow texans his official 
inaugural calendar ends sunday with a national prayer service at the 
washington cathedral 
bush acknowledged he couldnt find his way around the white house 
his first night after he and the first lady returned from the long 
round of balls i got lost trying to find a couple of kids rooms 
yeah he chuckled 
along with his mother five of bushs children their spouses and 
10 grandchildren shared the first night in the mansion after a 
luncheon for the entire bush clan in town 240 relatives in all 
the kin scattered 
its a great joy to have our kids over there in the living 
quarters last night said bush one got sick so i had the duty 
at about 6 oclock this morning ellie leblond i pumped half a 
tylenol into her and shes looking good ate two pancakes what 
youd call a rapid recovery 
bush expressed special feeling too for the thousands who stood 
outside the white house in subfreezing temperatures for a chance 
to tour it at the new presidents invitation the white house is 
routinely opened for limited tours by the public but this was 
different 
i must say that was kind of interesting said bush i was 
saying to myself now what does it take for somebody to stay awake 
all night to come into the white house what kind of people are 
they well they were all different kinds of people a lot of kids 
a lot of young people some older 
the common thread was that they felt they were lucky to be 
there which amazed me in a sense because i thought we were so lucky 
to have people that would care that much 
on the hostage issue bush was asked if his inaugural address 
reflected any movement or change of policy regarding the 
imprisonment of ap correspondent terry anderson and eight other 
americans believed held in lebanon by shiite moslems bush had said 
in the speech that assistance can be shown here and will be long 
remembered good will begets good will 
bush told reporters i dont think its a change of policy but 
i wanted to be sure i mentioned in that speech my absolute 
determination not to forget either the powmias or these 
hostages and i wanted that right in there it was one the few 
specific points in an otherwise thematic speech and in terms of 
your question i hope it was heard around the world 
you know bush added we keep hearing rumors that countries 
want to have improved relations with the united states i wanted to 
make clear to them that good will begets good will i also know 
enough about the situation to think in fairness that because of 
the nature of the hostageholders you can cant finger any one 
country for holding americans hostage against their will 
but people have in the past facilitated the release of our 
citizens and id love to see that happen again and i wont and i 
wont forget it 
but having said that bush concluded were not going to 
escalate the currency of holding americans hostage were not going 
to have people feel that we are going to make concessions in order 
to free those precious lives

at the elegant civil war pension building the luminaries 
included cia director william webster senators alan k simpson of 
wyoming and bob dole of kansas and doles wife elizabeth bushs 
designate for secretary of labor 
but perhaps the most photographed person at the ball was ronald 
v knapp 
a gorbachev lookalike complete with an artificial birthmark he 
spent the night laughing and being photographed alongside other 
partygoers ill probably end up in more scrapbooks than anybody 
in washington he said 
maybe he looked too much like the soviet leader webster arrived 
with two bodyguards despite the already tight security 
simpson danced in an impromptu conga line joined by hundreds of 
other celebrants dressed in anything from black tie to scottish 
tartan kilts at a party including states and territories ranging 
from simpsons wyoming to guam and the virgin islands

several people fainted during the sardinecan simulation at the 
kennedy center where 5000 people in a place that maybe could 
accommodate 1500 the crowd was so dense that one woman who fainted 
was kept from falling to the floor no floor space was available 
one woman complained that she had spent all this money on her 
new ball gown and the only place it could be seen was the ladies 
room 
no one could move from shortly after the party began at 8 pm in 
the grand foyer that parallels the potomac river and connects the 
kennedy centers three auditoriums until after george and barbara 
bushs fiveminute visit at 1125 pm 
during the threehour wait for the bushes visit the 
shouldertobosom audience whiled away the time by talking to their 
neighbors the resulting din was such that 
even conversation was difficult and the most effective 
communications award should go to the two women signlanguage users 
who had been stationed on either side of the makeshift stage so 
they could translate bushs comments to the hardofhearing during 
the longwait for the presidential party the two signers chatted 
back and forth across the 50foot stage it was the only way to 
communicate

congressional leaders on saturday praised the 
tone of conciliation sounded by president bush in his inaugural 
address but said the nation should expect some discord as the new 
administration pursues an agenda 
theres a good spirit now and i think thats useful said 
rep thomas s foley dwash the house majority leader there 
will be some difficulties and disagreements obviously but its a 
good mood in which to start any administration 
george bush has done everything during the transition that he 
could to offer an olive branch to the congress said rep dick 
cheney rwyo the house minority whip 
the reaction yesterday on both sides of the aisle was very 
positive to the presidents speech he said but he cautioned i 
think people shouldnt mistake this for meaning there wont be 
disagreements there will be thats as it should be 
foley and cheney appeared on cable news networks newsmaker 
saturday program 
bush in his inaugural address on friday asked for a new 
cooperative spirit between the republican white house and the 
democratic congress while he offered little detail of what specific 
proposals hell ask congress to approve bushs speech was greeted 
warmly by the opposition 
on saturday bush said he has suggested to congressional leaders 
that he address a joint session of the house and senate on feb 9 to 
lay out his plans 
it was a beautiful and warm speech less ideological than 
former president reagan and i feel much better rep anthony 
beilenson dcalif said of bushs inaugural address 
but beilenson a member of the house rules committee said bush 
still was not dealing realistically with the deficit and the need 
for raising taxes 
weve got to all stop this pretense with there not being any 
additional revenues you cant do that the realities are somewhat 
different he said 
leaders of the house and senate have insisted that bushs 
campaign pledge not to raise taxes is unrealistic and that new 
revenues will be needed to meet deficit reduction targets but they 
are equally insistent that they will not propose new taxes on their 
own that bush will eventually admit the need for new federal 
revenue 
some of the first difficult disagreements of his presidency will 
ensue next month when bush is expected to send congress his detailed 
proposals for revising the fiscal 1990 budget that reagan submitted 
on jan 9 
but even when conflict comes democrats predicted it would be 
less acrimonious than the often sharp battles with reagan 
i think bush understands the congress and the need for working 
with cooperation said sen robert byrd dwva former majority 
leader and the new chairman of the senate appropriations committee 
weve had too much confrontation the people will be better 
served he said 
foley said bushs reputation for straightforwardness and 
openness will serve him well on capitol hill 
craig fuller cochairman of bushs transition team said on the 
cnn program that bush has the advantage when compared to reagan of 
his long year in washington including two terms in the house 
you have relationships of respect and trust on both sides that 
have been built up over the years he said 
bush based his appeal for bipartisanship largely on foreign 
policy the area of his greatest expertise 
in his inaugural speech bush seemed to hint that there would be 
no new money for some of the social educational and environmental 
programs he has championed instead where money is needed it will 
be shifted from other spending categories or sought from 
nongovernmental sources he indicated 
our funds are low bush said we have a deficit to bring 
down we have more will than wallet but will is what we need he 
said 
rep beryl anthony dark chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee said he saw hard times coming 
he pointed to the private sector and to sacrifice as ways to 
achieve some of the goals anthony said youre going to have a 
confrontation of numbers and of policies 
foley said he doubted a fullscale budget summit such as the 
one with reagan following the 1987 stock market crisis will soon 
occur although congressional leaders have already been invited to 
the white house for a meeting on the deficit next week

gandhi and reports said at least 19 people were injured in 
electionrelated violence

national parliamentary elections 
voting was suspended at five centers in the state of nagaland 
after clashes between rival groups left three people injured 
election officials said 
at least 16 supporters of gandhis congress party were injured in 
the key state of tamil nadu united news of india reported the news 
agency also said two bombs exploded there but there were no reports 
of casualties 
despite the violence election officials reported heavy turnouts 
in polling for assemblies in three states where voting will restore 
local rule the government in new delhi imposed federal rule in the 
states last year after political crises there 
in tamil nadu a southern state an estimated 65 percent of 36 
million eligible voters went to the polls election officials said 
an estimated 75 percent of 600000 eligible voters in the state 
of nagaland and about 97 percent of 300000 eligible voters in 
mizoram cast ballots 
results are expected sunday 
saturdays elections are important for gandhi and his party 
because they faced popular regional parties in all three states 
but the crucial test is tamil nadu where more than 2000 
candidates vied for 234 seats in the state assembly 
gandhi must call national elections by december but a tamil nadu 
victory could allow him to move sooner a loss there could give more 
time to organize to the newly formed peoples party which is trying 
to unite behind gandhis chief rival vp singh 
preelection polls showed congress trailing the frontrunner 
muthuvel karunanidhi and his dravida munnetra kazhagam party that 
party was expected to win about 120 of the 234 seats karunanidhi is 
backed by singh 
karunanidhi served as tamil nadu chief minister from 1967 to 
1976 when he lost to mg ramachandran a popular actor who turned 
to politics at the peak of his career 
ramachandran led tamil nadu for 10 years until he died december 
1987 
his death split the huge all india anna dravida munnetra kazhagam 
party into two factions one is now led by his 64yearold widow 
janaki the other is led his leading lady on screen who says she 
secretly married him off screen jayalalitha jayaram 
the leader of the winning party will become chief minister 
gandhis party has not said who it would pick if it won in tamil

on a day when much of washington was discussing 
what george bush will or should do a group of scholars and scarred 
political veterans gathered to talk about what he cant do 
fragmentation micromanagement constraints 
stymied encroachment were the terms of art at a seminar on 
the fettered presidency staged on the last full day of ronald 
reagans presidency by the conservative american enterprise 
institute 
it drew participation from old reaganite figures such as richard 
perle jeane kirkpatrick and robert bork 
their theme summed up by l gordon crovitz a wall street 
journal editorialist instead of an imperial presidency we have 
an imperial congress aided by an activist court 
the same thought popped into the head of president bush during an 
impromptu news conference saturday on his first day in the white 
house 
im concerned as a lot of congressmen are as a lot of 
senators are about the erosion of presidential power he said 
he said he wanted to talked with reasonable members in the 
senate and the house about how to reestablish in the presidency 
the firm hand that i think the constitution gave the president 
the discussion at the american enterprise institute thursday 
celebrated the publication of a book its cover picturing a white 
house encircled by a chain which made the same case congress has 
managed to erode the power of the presidency and of the executive 
branch and presidents from here on out should fight to regain the 
power they once exercised 
a chart showed that one legislative restriction on the 
presidents ability to conduct foreign affairs was enacted by 
congress between 1789 and 1900 and 37 were adopted between 1950 and 
1960 but 191 passed during reagans eightyear watch 
he leaves the office of the presidency weaker than he found it 
in 1981 lamented crovitz saying reagan had been a strong 
president but an unsuccessful one as the keeper of the institution 
of the presidency 
the problem of congressional usurpation of power cripples all 
chief executives he said it would have been just as severe for a 
president dukakis 
bork reagans rejected nominee to the supreme court wrote to 
complain of an intrusive and debilitating congressional oversight 
of intelligence activities and of congress vacillating 
incursions into foreign policy such as the boland amendments 
restricting the use of money to help the contras 
he deplored particularly the supreme courts 81 unsurprising 
but disappointing decision upholding the law under which 
independent counsels are named to investigate the ethics of the 
executive branch 
bork said presidents must fight congressional encroachments 
perhaps by refusing to accept some restrictions even at the risk 
of political damage 
it would be a prolonged and bloody fight he said but our 
national wellbeing requires that it be made 
kirkpatrick reagans former united nations ambassador 
complained that a congress that wants a hand in running foreign 
policy cannot keep secrets and she said secrecy is vital to 
diplomacy she deplored the ethic of revealall 
perle former assistant secretary of defense complained that 
congress micromanagement of the defense budget invited 
wastefulness 
once he said former defense secretary caspar weinberger wanted 
to chop 600 million worth of unneeded jets from the pentagon 
budget but swallowed hard and accepted them when told the planes 
were built in the home district of a vital congressional chairman 
and c boyden gray who is moving into the white house as 
president bushs counsel wrote that the problem is exacerbated by a 
congress where most seats are safe that has become vulnerable to 
the paralyzing effect of special interests 
democrats and incumbents he wrote generally have 
controlled congress for so long that most members of congress have 
figured out how to achieve the rough equivalence of life tenure

syrias defense minister alleged that israel duped 
an american soldier into carrying the bomb that blew up a pan am jet 
over scotland last month israel called the charge ridiculous 
an agent of israeli intelligence mossad handed him the 
bombladen bag to carry in return for 300000 claiming it was 
diamonds worth 500000 needed to be smuggled into the united 
states mustafa tlass said in an interview published saturday in 
kuwaits daily alqabas 
reached in damascus tlass confirmed the newspaper reported his 
statements correctly but he refused to give additional information 
in israel foreign ministry spokesman alon leil said it is 
ridiculous and malicious this story shows how the syrian leaders 
are not serious toward israel and peace in the region 
syria is israels most vehement enemy in the middle east israel 
has accused palestinian terrorists of placing the bomb and has 
dismissed claims of israeli involvement as ludicrous 
the syrian minister did not say where he got his information but 
he said it was known to western investigators 
britains sunday express newspaper in an unattributed report 
jan 15 said us government investigators are looking into the 
theory the bomb went aboard the plane with a soldier involved in a 
diamond smuggling ring 
all 259 people on board pan am flight 103 were killed and 11 
people on the ground in lockerbie scotland died when the boeing 
747 fell from the sky dec 21 
the flight originated in frankfurt west germany and stopped in 
london en route to new york 
tlass said the one who carried the explosives aboard the plane 
in frankfurt was one of the american soldiers serving at a base in 
west germany and he did it unknowingly he did not name the 
soldier 
british investigators determined the plane was destroyed by a 
bomb placed in the luggage hold but they have not said who was 
responsible 
representatives of the palestine liberation organization have 
talked of a mossad connection suggesting israel planned the attack 
to throw blame on the plo and undermine a new dialogue between the 
plo and washington 
suspicions also have turned on several syrianbacked palestinian 
factions which might be trying to derail peace overtures of plo 
chairman yasser arafat 
in addition a caller claiming to represent an iranian group 
called the guardians of the islamic revolution made two calls to the 
associated press in london saying that group planted the bomb

that soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has fostered an artistic 
renaissance in her homeland which she soon will visit for the first 
time since defecting in 1970 
the dancer speaking in an interview in her london apartment 
said she is pleased with changes in soviet society under gorbachev 
i think he is a very courageous man it gives a new spring for 
any form of art i think artistic life will flourish if this 
progress continues 
it is quite difficult for russian people to take this freedom 
because years without freedom left its imprint but they will get 
used to it and i think it will be really great for artists to 
express whatever they want to say 
during the interview the day before she left on the twoweek 
visit the 47yearold ballerina wore a long pale green scarf as a 
headband a black and white knitted top and black pants she smoked 
a cigarette in a black holder 
ms makarova has been invited to leningrad by her old company 
the kirov ballet she trained and advanced to principal dancer with 
the company before breaking away while on tour in london in 
september 1970 
i wanted greater artistic freedom and opportunity she said 
granted asylum to start a new career she became an international 
star she made her home in san francisco married us businessman 
edward karker and raised their son andrusha he remains at home to 
go to school but karker will accompany his wife to leningrad 
ms makarova will make two stage appearances during her visit 
she also has been invited by the leningrad film festival to show her 
series of four onehour programs titled ballerina made in 
britain to describe a ballerinas life and recently shown in the 
united states 
she said she believes she is the first soviet artist defector to 
be invited back since the bolshevik revolution in 1917 
horowitz went back to perform but he was never a defector 
she said 
pianist vladimir horowitz emigrated from his homeland in 1925 and 
became a us citizen he returned in 1986 on a visit and performed 
there 
asked what she had missed most in her native land ms makarova 
said in heavily accented english not to be able to dance in the 
kirov the nature of the russian people the russian countryside 
not to be able to communicate 
most of all i missed my family and friends and its very 
important for me to see them after almost 19 years she said 
the dancer decided to stay in the west nine years after rudolf 
nureyev quit the kirov to defect while on tour mikhail baryshnikov 
followed suit four years after ms makarova left

amnesty international on sunday released a report 
urging brazils government to investigate the widespread killing 
of community leaders 
the report came a month after the death of environmental activist 
francisco chico mendes whose murder drew international 
attention 
amnesty international fears that when public interest in the 
murder of chico mendes abates his case will follow the pattern of 
cases now numbering many hundreds which remain pending because of 
inconclusive or obstructed investigations the report said 
brazilian authorities have said that darcy da silva the 
21yearold son of a rancher has confessed to the killing 
mendes 42 was an internationally acclaimed ecologist who said 
he received death threats from cattler ranchers for organizing 
demonstrations against deforestation of the amazon rain forest he 
was under local police protection when he was shot 
 
amnesty international said authorities did not investigate six 
previous attempts to murder mendes it said he was one of five rural 
trade union presidents killed in 1988 
these cases are among hundreds which show the result of 
governmental failure to take effective action against political 
killings in rural areas said the organization which won the 
nobel peace prize in 1977 
a new wave of death threats and killings began after the 
municipal elections of november 1988 amnesty international said 
more than 1000 killings have occurred since 1980 in the 
context of land disputes 
amnesty internationals information indicates that less than 1 
percent of these killings have resulted in convictions of gunmen or 
of people who hired them to kill

jurors who begin deliberating alleged child 
killer joel steinbergs fate monday could send him to prison for 
most of his remaining life even if they believe his version of what 
happened to his adopted daughter 
even if the jurors accept steinbergs claim that he returned home 
to find 6yearold lisa steinberg comatose it is undisputed that he 
virtually ignored her while she lay unconscious on the cold tiles of 
their bathroom floor for several hours 
instead he lay in bed with hedda nussbaum his battered livein 
companion getting high on cocaine and its derivative crack 
before the jurors get the case state supreme court justice 
harold rothwax will tell them the defendant had a parental duty to 
see to the health and safety of lisa the girl he got illegally at 
birth from an unwed teenager and raised as his own 
the judge will tell them that if they find steinberg showed 
depraved indifference to the firstgraders life they may 
convict him of seconddegree murder even if he never hit the child 
he could face up to 25 years to life 
the jury can also consider firstdegree manslaughter punishable 
by up to 25 years seconddegree manslaughter a maximum of 15 
years and criminally negligent homicide up to four years 
anything less than a verdict of seconddegree murder is a 
victory for the defense said steinberg lawyer ira london 
london and cocounsel adrian diluzio say lisa was attacked in a 
jealous rage by ms nussbaum who saw the child as a rival for the 
affection of the man she considered a god 
diluzio says steinberg 47 left lisa alive and well with ms 
nussbaum whom the lawyer called a poor excuse for a woman and a 
mother when he went to dinner with a friend the evening of nov 
1 1987 
diluzio says steinberg returned about three hours later and found 
lisa unconscious and even now does not know what really happened 
the next morning emergency medical service workers took lisa 
from steinbergs greenwich village apartment to a hospital she died 
three days later 
assistant district attorney peter casolaro says it was steinberg 
drugged with cocaine and vexed and frustrated by the childs 
rebelliousness who struck lisa 
hes a huge guy and shes a little girl and she gets knocked 
out casolaro said in his summation friday 
and then he leaves the apartment and goes to get dinner he 
continued and he comes back and does some more drugs and he 
doesnt do a thing for the next 12 hours until six in the morning 
when she finally stops breathing 
these are acts of omission that put her in grave risk of 
death casolaro said this isnt just depraved indifference to 
human life this is monumental indifference to human life 
steinbergs lawyers claimed several times during the trial that 
he did not perceive the danger that lisa was in and that he thought 
she was asleep 
and in their doublebarreled summation part of it by london and 
part by diluzio the defense lawyers asserted that even if 
steinberg had called for medical help sooner it would not have done 
lisa any good 
this casolaro said is unknowable he said the point in any case 
is that steinberg ignored his duty to summon help for his clearly 
distressed child 
the prosecutor conceded that steinberg didnt intend to kill the 
child 
but he added hes an adult he knows what smashing a 
6yearold girl in the head would do you have to ask isnt 
this the equivalent of taking a gun and shooting her in the head

a spectacular light show that some mistook for a crashing 
airplane or a comet when it lit up the night sky over several states 
was just the body of a derelict soviet rocket burning up in the 
atmosphere officials said saturday 
the federal aviation administration national weather service and 
military bureaus and bases across the midwest and southwest were 
swamped with calls about friday nights display officials said 
sightings of the object around 910 pm est were reported from 
texas oklahoma louisiana arkansas kentucky tennessee indiana 
missouri illinois kansas mississippi and iowa officials said 
it was definitely a soviet rocket body that was reentering the 
earths atmosphere said maj dick adams at the north american air 
defense command at colorado springs colo 
he said the rocket body that fell out of orbit was either 
destroyed in reentry or fragments of it have fallen to earth and 
are some place but who knows where most such objects burn up 
before hitting the ground 
the reentry was unusual only because it happened over land and 
was visible in the night sky adams said 
robin england of abilene texas said the object just appeared 
all of a sudden out of the south and fell straight due north and it 
left a line just as straight as could be 
some callers thought that was a sign of trouble 
they thought a plane blew up in the sky said patsy halfacre 
dispatcher for the washington county ark sheriffs department 
it was the most horrible thing i ever saw and it scared the 
heck out of me i kept worrying and i called the airport and they 
told me it was a satellite said katheryn berger of spring texas 
i said thank god it wasnt an airplane 
others were more appreciative of the display 
it was fabulous just fascinating im 57 years old and ive 
never seen anything like it said jack lippincott of fulton mo 
we had this terrific panoramic view of the thing you could see 
the reflection of the moon in the rocket body and there were these 
white and orange spots trailing along behind it at the same speed 
then it faded off 
it was the most spectacular thing i have ever seen in the 
sky said laura kyro an astronomer at the st louis mo science 
center even better than a shuttle landing 
people were stopping their cars on the highway and about a 
dozen came into our office because it is so spectacular said john 
feldt lead forecaster for the national weather service in st louis 
in houston david czarnek and his 11yearold daughter went 
outside to look at the moon and the stars but their attention was 
caught by a very bright falling light 
it was real bright a little yellowish with a small tail 
czarnek said the tail was shimmering and then it went behind the 
trees and we couldnt see anything 
it looked like a comet you know said tom wald of atkins 
ark i just happened to walk outside at the right time and i 
grabbed a camera but i dont think my pictures were any good i 
was so excited i dont think i was focused too well

police blocked roads and stopped 
strangers on saturday to prevent a vigil at the grave of a student 
who burned himself to death 20 years ago to protest the sovietled 
invasion 
in the village of vsetaty 18 miles north of prague authorities 
checked the identifications of western reporters and czechoslovaks 
traveling on roads to the village 
the village was the hometown of jan palach who burned himself to 
death in pragues wencenslas square to protest the soviet invasion 
that crushed the countrys communist party reforms of 1968 
czechoslovaks without vsetaty residence permits or police 
permission to pass the roadblocks were told they could not go to the 
village where the part of the cemetery where palach is buried was 
closed for technical reasons according to a sign outside 
the charter 77 human rights group called the vigil at palachs 
grave but western reporters at vsetaty saw no sign of them in the 
village activist petr uhl said on friday that passenger trains 
traveling to vsetaty would not stop there on saturday 
uniformed police also patrolled wenceslas square late saturday 
but there were no crowds gathered as there had been the previous six 
evenings in the longest wave of unrest since the weeks after the 
1968 invasion 
an attempt to commemorate palach on jan 15 was broken up by 
police spawning a week of demonstrations in prague 
the youth daily mlada fronta reported that police arrested 280 
people during a demonstration thursday when truncheonswinging riot

a 59yearold man who suffered a fractured skull were injured on 
jan 15 it said 
police threats of violence and a heavy presence of riot police

mlada fronta also reported that anonymous bomb threats had been 
made in the past 11 days against two prague schools the citys 
kotva department store the main railway station and the national 
theater 
the reports that violence had been threatened appeared to be part 
of the efforts of communist authorities to discredit dissidents and 
demonstrators 
mlada fronta said all the places where bombs reportedly were 
planted were searched and nothing was found 
but jiri schwarz manager of the kotva department store said he 
knew nothing about a reported bomb threat when asked about it by a 
western reporter 
several calls were made to the communist party daily rude pravo 
and to a prague emergency number threatening violence against 
security forces the party daily said 
the anonymous callers announced that if the police wont leave 
alone the antistate demonstration in wenceslas square on friday 
firearms will be used the daily said

a baby boom among alaskas natives could herald 
an increase in the rate of suicides violent deaths and other 
problems plaguing the villagers a new report says 
the report released friday by the alaska federation of natives 
and the university of alaskas institute of social and economic 
studies concludes that without major steps taken by the government 
problems in the villages will likely only get worse 
especially troubling the report said is a population surge in 
rural villages that will mean an increasing number of young 
villagers without jobs dependent on government benefits and at high 
risk of alcoholism suicide and violent death 
during the next two decades young native adults many of whom 
have been brutalized by alcohol abuse despair violence and deaths 
in their homes and villages will be having their own children 
the report said 
unless the cycle can be broken the projected high birth rate 
for young native adults will create a new generation at risk far 
more numerous than the current one 
the native birth rate in 1980 was twice the national average and 
50 percent higher than the rate for nonnatives in alaska the 
report said at the current rate alaskas native population of 
75000 is expected to double in 26 years 
alcoholism accidental death and suicide are major concerns among 
native alaskans 
alaskans drink the equal of 4 gallons of pure alcohol per person 
each year compared with the national average of 288 gallons 
according to the national institute for alcohol abuse and alcoholism 
alaska has twice the national average of accidental deaths and 
70 percent are alcoholrelated according to a 1982 state report 
suicide rates in rural alaska quadrupled during the past decade 
and doubled in urban areas according to the 1982 report officials 
believe 80 percent of the suicides were alcoholrelated 
among the recent reports conclusions 
a plague of alcoholism violence and selfdestruction afflicts 
natives throughout alaska 
village economies based largely on public assistance or 
government jobs cannot meet the needs of the growing native 
population 
despite improvements in public health native alaskans remain 
more vulnerable to serious injury infectious disease and violent 
death than nonnatives 
the document was the first status report on alaska natives 
published in a decade said afn president janie leask 
the report does not offer specific solutions although leask said 
it has become obvious that many government programs intended to help 
alaska natives have failed

a man who wrestled away a policemans gun 
and fatally shot two officers before he was gunned down had acted 
bizarrely hours earlier police and friends said 
dale randy connors mumbled to himself friday looked dazed and 
occasionally raised his arms in the air said friends and street 
acquaintances 
connors 35 had been arrested at least twice for willful 
obstruction of a thoroughfare after standing in the middle of the 
street and waving his arms 
the usually affable easygoing connors became violent just 
before noon in the parking lot of a doughnut shop and he later was 
overheard telling one officer he had shot i got you now 
basically he was a nice quiet eventempered guy said 
johnny flamingo 44 a friend of connors who witnessed the 
shootings he was the kind of person whod talk to you about god 
but i never saw him like this before 
connors had his own apartment but was well known among the 
homeless in downtown san jose 
i saw him about 735 this morning and he kind of mumbled 
said michael williams who said he has known connors for six years 
i was wondering why he didnt speak he wasnt like that he was a 
good guy hed come around and have a little fun with us all the 
time 
officers wore black bands on their badges saturday in memory of 
their slain comrades the first to die in the line of duty since 
1985 
the friday shootings witnessed by about 30 people were partly 
videotaped by san jose state university students doing a documentary 
on the homeless it began as a routine call of a disturbance outside 
winchells donut house a block from the college 
connors had been acting bizarrely repeatedly challenging 
people to fight and may have been accosting them for money said 
police chief joseph mcnamara 
officer gene simpson 45 a 19year veteran working an overtime 
shift approached connors outside winchells which had evicted 
connors three times and attempted to calm him down 
almost immediately connors attacked the officer witnesses said 
the two men wrestled to the ground but connors managed to pull 
simpsons 357caliber magnum from his holster 
simpson ran off and called for help on his portable radio police 
said 
simpson ducked around cars in the parking lot in an attempt to 
escape connors but connors followed shooting 
police said simpson fell to the ground either from a gunshot or 
after losing his footing 
witness samuel tobias said that after the third shot he heard 
connors tell the officer i got you now 
as simpson lay on the cement connors walked up and shot him in 
the head police said 
officer gordon silva 39 was flagged down by a bystander and 
came to simpsons aid however as he climbed out of his car 
connors ran into the street and shot him once in the stomach and 
twice in the leg 
other officers arrived and fired at connors hitting him three 
times in the heart and killing him instantly 
silva a 17year veteran died several hours later 
the blurred videotape made by the two journalism students 
recorded 26 shots in 3 minutes with 21 of those coming during the 
final 30second volley that killed connors

complaints by a major grain processor about 
corrupt commodities traders sparked a federal undercover 
investigation at the nations largest futures exchanges a newspaper 
reported saturday 
officials at archer daniels midland co based in decatur first 
approached prosecutors under us attorney anton valukas about two 
years ago the chicago tribune reported quoting sources who were 
not named 
a security guard answering the telephone at adms headquarters on 
saturday said a company spokesman would not be available until 
monday 
the adm complaint came at a time when federal prosecutors in new 
york were cracking down on insider trading on wall street 
the seriousness of the allegations of fraud at the chicago board 
of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange prompted valukas to go 
after similar corruption in his region the newspaper said 
the investigation centers on allegations that as many as 100 
traders at the two exchanges systematically cheated customers out of 
millions of dollars in executing trades 
on friday assistant us attorney daniel gillogly would neither 
confirm nor deny the investigation but the chicago suntimes 
reported he and assistant us attorney ira raphaelson were the lead 
prosecutors on the case 
fbi agents richard carlson and michael mcloughlin began working 
as trainees at adm investors inc the farm giants commodities 
trading arm in december 1986 and then acquired seats on the 
chicago board of trade the newspaper said 
richard burket an adm vice president told the newspaper the two 
were employed by the firm but he would not comment further 
in addition to the undercover agents the fbi used six traders 
who were angry about alleged corruption to inform on their 
colleagues at the two exchanges the suntimes reported also citing 
sources it did not name 
about a year after the investigation began the six were wired to 
record conversations on the frenzied trading floors and during 
social gatherings after work the newspaper said 
the two exchanges were served with subpoenas thursday demanding 
records of trades 
fbi spokeswoman jane koshutko would neither confirm nor deny the 
investigation friday but two law enforcement officials in 
washington who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed it 
thursday 
the complaint by adm indicates that some traders who deal in tens 
of millions in futures contracts a year were victims of alleged 
fraud at the exchanges 
while carlson and mcloughlin were trading in the treasury bond 
and soybean pits at the board of trade two other fbi agents were 
trading currency at the merc the tribune said 
everybody is obviously concerned about what this means board 
of trade spokesman raymond carmichael said friday 
commodities exchanges are hotbeds of capitalism in which 
speculators essentially bet millions of dollars on the future prices 
of goods ranging from gold to treasury bills to frozen orange juice 
fbi agentsturnedtraders recorded conversations that suggest 
some trades were rigged to prevent customers from getting 
fairmarket prices and that some brokers sent false reports to 
customers to hide the skimming of profits of overcharges on 
commissions the chicago tribune has reported 
fourteen seats were sold at the chicago mercantile exchange and 
the chicago board of trade from thursday when the investigation was 
first reported through the end of business friday

lech walesa met with other solidarity 
leaders on saturday to draft the outlawed unions official answer to 
a communist party offer to legalize the labor group 
solidarity representives from across poland hoped to complete 
their statement by sunday said jacek kuron a veteran 
antigovernment activist 
attending the meeting were about 30 people including members of 
the unions executive commission chaired by walesa and the senior 
union advisers 
late saturday walesa left the meeting and returned home for the 
night but the meeting continued no union officials were available 
for comment but a solidarity source said an announcement of the 
meetings results was expected sunday 
the urgent meeting was called by walesa to respond to the 
announcement thursday of the ruling polish united workers party of a 
new stance endorsing more than one trade union organization 
currently the only legal trade union alliance is the 
governmentsanctioned opzz 
the party offered to legalize solidarity under terms to be 
negotiated if the union respects the law and agrees to help in 
reforming the economy 
the party statement agreed on at a stormy central committee 
meeting earlier in the week marked a dramatic reversal for the 
party and for polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
in 1981 he declared martial law and interned thousands of people 
in order to crush solidarity which was banned the following year 
but the worsening economic situation and the threat of an 
outburst of public unrest because of rising prices and consumer 
shortages have helped persuade officials to reassess solidarity 
the union is now seen as a potential partner that could help 
smooth the introduction of painful economic and political reforms 
that both sides agree on necessary 
at a closeddoor rally friday walesa said he favored beginning 
as soon as possible roundtable talks with the government that 
would lead to legalization because the countrys problems are so 
overwhelming 
responding to a worker saying the party always lies walesa said 
i dont trust them either but if someone gives a chance for 
pluralism i take the chance 
but there was some feeling among solidarity supporters that the 
government should recognize their organization immediately so walesa 
could go to the talks officially as a union representative and not 
as a private citizen 
solidarity has to be a side at the talks and not just a subject 
of discussion said the rev henryk jankowski an adviser to 
walesa who is he there to represent if not solidarity 
earlier at a saturday morning rally of 4000 workers at the 
lenin shipyard in gdansk the leader of the shipyard solidarity 
committee alojzy szablewski appealed to prime minister mieczyslaw 
f rakowski and industry minister mieczyslaw wilczek to rescind a 
decision to liquidate the yard as unprofitable 
such an action would be received with great relief by our work 
force and by the whole nation szablewski said 
liquidation of the yard officially began dec 1 but outwardly 
work there appears normal several private companies are opening up 
operations that would take over parts of the yard 
walesa attended the rally and was applauded by his fellow workers 
but did not address the crowd

president mikhail s gorbachev on saturday rejected 
calls to import more consumer goods to end shortages saying it 
would not force the soviet union to learn to manufacture its own 
products 
he also attacked speculators hoarding laundry detergent caviar 
childrens clothing and other items a laundry soap shortage is 
plaguing soviet mothers this winter 
if we take a credit of a billion dollars and buy goods for one 
or two years they will be in the market but what will happen in 
the third year he asked rhetorically in a speech to the moscow 
communist party conference 
will we continue not to produce anything ourselves he said 
that was the government policy when the soviet union was enjoying 
the benefits of high oil prices gorbachev said in excerpts 
broadcast on the evening news 
instead of technical and scientific progress instead of 
stimulating the economy all faults were covered up with the wild 
sums the country got due to high oil prices he said 
thats all over now he said with oil prices down we need to 
found our own industry he said we cant continue selling raw 
materials for western consumer goods 
television cameras showed audience members hastily scribbling 
notes when gorbachev supported his argument with the shortage of 
laundry detergent and soap 
in the first quarter of 1988 the government sold 80 tons of 
laundry detergent and there was no shortage he said yet this 
year more than 200 tons has been sold yet the soap is a rare find 
production of soap also has grown from 50 tons to 110 tons 
gorbachev said 
certain people are making money on the deficit hoarding 
everything from black caviar to tights for children gorbachev 
charged 
gorbachev also rejected calls for a crackdown on his opponents 
he said it would be narrowminded to employ the same old methods 
we are trying to give up which we condemn while trying to 
democratize the country

with temperatures dipping to 64 degrees 
below zero saturday about 26000 servicemen prepared for a mock 
battle in maneuvers described as the premier cold weather training 
exercise in the free world 
but participants in brim frost 89 may be getting too much of a 
good thing 
overnight lows saturday dipped to 50 degrees below zero or lower 
at 11 reporting stations in alaska including 64 below zero at 
mcgrath 
air force col john d hopper jr said orders were issued to 
field commanders allowing them to suspend the exercise if weather 
conditions become too severe 
that means temperatures ranging from 30 below to 65 below 
we do have some curtailment of activity this morning hopper 
said saturday although noting that the exercise still is primarily 
in its command and communication phase 
about 26000 servicemen 120 aircraft and 1000 vehicles from the 
united states and canada are participating in the 15 million 
biennial arctic training exercise which military planners called 
the largest of its kind in the west 
among the players are the us army air force marines coast 
guard alaska national guard and reserve units and canadian land 
and air forces 
the exercise is to conclude feb 1 
maneuvers are planned at more than 17 sites around alaska but 
the focus of the exercise will be a set piece battle between two 
army brigades on the tanana flats at fort greely about 75 miles 
southeast of fairbanks 
that will include a battalionsized canadian force dropped into 
the arctic winter darkness by parachute 
planners said they were emphasizing safety throughout the 
maneuvers 
our track record has been very good said army maj gen 
harold t fields jr in charge of land forces during the exercise 
last month 3500 soldiers at fort greely trained in weather 
that was 44 below zero and they came through the exercise with no 
serious coldrelated injuries fields said 
army maj john tilman said the bitter cold produced ice fog which 
has restricted visibility in many areas that has delayed some 
flights and stranded some flight crews around eielson air force 
base today he said 
were also having problems with metal fatigue and rubber 
fatigue on vehicles and aircraft tilman said 
this kind of stuff weather is old hat to the military 
personnel stationed in alaska he said but for guys like me 
from the lower 48 fort mcpherson ga this is quite a learning 
experience were getting initiated fast

sales of ak47 assault rifles have increased 
at some gun stores since one was used in a schoolyard massacre 
dealers said 
one gun dealer said he plans to stop stocking the weapon and 
concerns that distribution will be further restricted prompted the 
sales surge sellers said 
the gun was already a popular gun al campbell general 
manager of western surplus said friday now everyone wants to 
get it before the distribution is stopped its having a profound 
effect on sales 
patrick purdy 24 used a semiautomatic sovietdesigned ak47 
rifle to shoot up an elementary schoolyard in stockton calif on 
tuesday five pupils were killed twentynine pupils and one teacher 
were wounded 
purdy fired more than 100 rounds from the rifle and then killed 
himself with a handgun 
since then there have been calls to either ban the sale of such 
highpowered semiautomatic rifles or subject buyers to the same 
background check and waiting period required of handgun buyers 
campbell said he used to sell three ak47s a week but now is 
selling at least one a day 
art noroian who said he sells the rifle for 349 at arts guns 
in reseda estimated the price could go as high as 800 if sales are 
restricted or the legislature passes a law banning the gun 
its trendy noroian said everybody wants to buy the gun 
theyre fun to shoot theyre outstanding to shoot its 
exhilarating its just a lot of fun 
he said his sales of the gun also increased after the shooting 
but declined to provide figures 
bob kahn owner of bampb sales in north hollywood and westminster 
said he sold 4500 ak47s over the last year most of the volume was 
wholesale to other dealers but there also were many retail sales he 
said 
sales increased as soon as the public perceived through the press 
that they might be restricted kahn said saturday 
kahn said veterans of korea and vietnam buy ak47s as nostalgia 
items for display and many people buy paramilitarystyle weapons 
because they are the latest in technology and use them for family 
outings to shooting ranges 
one orange county dealer randy garell said he would quit 
stocking the rifle at the grant boys store in costa mesa 
the handwriting is on the wall that these types of weapons with 
massive firepower have little true purpose said garell who also 
sells camping and outdoor gear i believe they are going to be 
banned eventually

crab meat with duxelle sauce and 
chocolatecovered macadamia nuts isnt the usual bill of fare for 
the homeless but that was on the menu saturday after celebrity 
chefs ousted from a fundraising event decided to cook instead for 
those who cant pay 
we normally serve a very nice meal a hot meal with either 
fresh fruit salad or fresh green salad but we dont serve clams 
or crab people around here got all perky about that said mitch 
snyder of the community for creative nonviolence which runs the 
homeless shelter 
a commercial event had been scheduled for saturday night and 
sunday charging 50 per ticket for saturday night and 15 for the 
sunday super bowl party the forprofit organization planning it a 
taste of america had expected to donate 150000 to 300000 in 
profits to the homeless shelter said spokeswomen for the sponsoring 
group 
but the event was canceled because of lastminute contract 
problems with the dc armory they said 
james dalrymple general manager of the armory did not 
immediately return a phone call to his home saturday 
obviously we could use the money and were sorry that didnt 
work out snyder said at least people in our shelter are going 
to get one nice meal 
the dismayed chefs who had brought some of their food with them 
met friday to decide what to do 
we had a choice whether we should pick up and go but we 
decided we were here to help the hungry and homeless so why dont 
we said john p hughes iii owner and chef of windows on the 
water in kennebunkport maine 
when president and mrs bush stop by his restaurant he usually 
serves them lobsterstuffed potatoes and he had intended to make 
the same dish for the a taste of america event but he managed to 
stop the shipment of 160 pounds of lobster 
it would have cost us 2000 said his wife cynthia were 
a small business we cant absorb that 
john weichman of all seasons restaurant in mobile ala had 
brought more than 500 worth of crab meat with him and filippo 
milone of the pillars restaurant also in mobile who had canceled 
his shipment of crab meat offered to split the cost 
referring to the homeless shelter residents weichman said 
hopefully theyll have a memorable meal and theyll realize they 
ate as well as some of the fat cats 
there appeared to be no clash of egos as the chefs whirled around 
the shelters kitchen directing college volunteers on the proper 
way to slice potatoes chop carrots and open and mix cans of tomato 
paste with whole tomatoes 
broccoli au gratin weichman pronounced as crates of broccoli 
appeared in the kitchen you gotta be flexible he said 
explaining the instant addition to the menu 
well make a good pasta with crab sauce whatever said 
milone reflecting the ad hoc menu decisions 
in addition to the crab meat with a sauce of bell pepper onions 
mushrooms and pimentos the chefs prepared a dish of roasted garlic 
potatoes pasta with a red sauce as well as a lamb dish and salad 
chef daniel thiebaut of the mauna kea beach resort in kohala 
coast hawaii got his company to donate the lamb fruit and special 
colored chocolatecovered macadamia nuts 
snyder surveyed the busy scene in his kitchen at 2 pm and asked 
warily you can get this dinner done by 5 pm 
no problem weichman responded 
snyder who runs the 1400person homeless shelter said he 
expected the residents to be thrilled by the culinary change of 
pace but some waited to be impressed 
itll probably be all right said ronnell showell 29 of 
washington who after thinking about it a moment added it 
should be all right 
herman jackson 51 also of washington said i think its a 
very good idea im thankful for everything we get 
snyder said the money that had been expected from the commercial 
event would have been used to renovate a theater next to the 
shelter a project that will cost about 250000 
weve discovered that cultural activities theatrical 
activities are very important to the people here he said 
there are no plans to build another shelter now 
we already operate the largest shelter in america snyder 
said were trying to make this as complete a model as possible so 
people here have the greatest chance possible to get out of here 
to help their transition back to the real world

the ballooning soviet budget deficit could pass the 
us deficit in 1990 according to figures published in a soviet 
newspaper saturday 
driven by the cost of the chernobyl cleanup a crash program to 
solve shortages of housing and consumer goods and reconstruction 
after the armenian earthquake soviet red ink could nearly double 
next year to 100 billion rubles or 162 billion 
that figure calculated by research economist ot bogomolov and 
reported in the newspaper arguments and facts is higher than 
estimates for the us deficit for 1989 which range from 127 
billion to 141 billion 
worse it looms as a far greater percentage of the soviet economy 
11 percent of gross national product compared to 3 percent to 4 
percent in the united states bogomolov said 
the economist blamed the deficit in part on the declining price 
of oil the soviet unions primary export and the antialcohol 
campaign which cost 65 billion in lost tax revenue 
he also cited urgent social problems apparently referring to 
the soviet governments decision to boost spending on housing and 
consumer goods this year to appease an unhappy population 
in addition the cost of reconstructing the area devastated by 
the armenian earthquake is estimated at more than 13 billion during 
the next two years 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said last week that soviet 
financial problems were so pressing that even the defense budget 
would have to be cut 
the soviet union first admitted to a budget deficit last autumn 
saying it has been running in the red for years while telling soviet 
citizens it was producing an annual surplus finance minister boris 
gostev projected a deficit of 55 billion on a 1989 government 
budget of 795 billion 
however some western economists say the severity of a deficit is 
determined by its proportion to the entire economy not just the 
government budget they say that is a better indicator of how far a 
nation can afford to go into debt 
until saturday the soviet union had not revealed the size of its 
economy 
but in reporting the 1988 economic statistics izvestia said 
saturday that the soviet gross national product grew 5 percent to 
14 trillion dollars in 1988 
that would be a strong increase if it did not include inflation 
but the government newspaper did not say the soviet union first 
acknowledged that it suffers from inflation last year but officials 
said they had not yet calculated the rate 
overall georgetown university soviet expert murray feshbach 
evaluated the economic performance described in the izvestia report 
as not enough progress but not failing badly either 
the izvestia report said one out of 10 enterprises in the country 
was losing money and only 12 percent of high schools have a single 
ersonal computer 
although the economic news was mixed feshbach noted the soviet 
union had progressed substantially in reducing the extremely high 
infant mortality rate the national figure dropped from 254 to 24 
deaths per 1000 births however that does not include deaths in 
the first six days of life 
tass said the infant mortality rate in central asia and 
kazakhstan ranges as high as 514 deaths per 1000 due to 
insufficient medical care and unfavorable conditions of womens 
work 
alcoholrelated crime and toxic air pollution also decreased 
feshbach said

the scene as did about a half dozen dc fire department units 
police said 
the disturbance was the latest in a series of problems plaguing 
the city prison system including escapes accusations of drug 
dealing inside prison walls disorders and years of litigation to 
reduce chronic overcrowding 
but corrections director hallem williams said early saturday the 
disturbance was not caused by overcrowding we are in compliance 
with the cap and overcrowding was not the issue he said in july 
1986 fires set by inmates destroyed four dormitories at the 
occoquan area of the correctional complex that blaze was blamed for 
severely intensifying the crowding that has plagued the prison 
system

prime minister herbert blaize was 
ousted as political leader of the ruling new national party during a 
party convention vote saturday night and replaced with his 
longtime critic keith mitchell 
the election of mitchell by a delegate vote of 190154 means he 
will be grenadas next prime minister if the centrist new national 
party wins in elections due by december 
blaize will remain prime minister until the elections 
though the press was excluded from the convention held in 
grenville on the caribbean islands east coast proceedings could be 
heard from outside the building through a loudspeaker 
mitchell 43 minister of communications and works has regularly 
criticized blaize for taking major decisions without consulting his 
cabinet it had been rumored for months that he would challenge 
blaizes party leadership 
blaizes ouster as party leader was apparently due to his drop in 
popularity especially among the young and his ill health at 71 
blaize is suffering from prostate cancer and an old spine injury he 
recently returned from several days of hospitalization in the united 
states 
blaize who was the partys leader since 1960 became prime 
minster when his party was elected in december 1984 replacing an 
interim government that had ruled since the us invasion of grenada 
in october 1983 
blaizes party originally controlled 14 of the 15 seats in 
parliament but the defection of elected party officials due to 
disputes with blaize reduced his partys majority to nine seats 
defecting party members created an opposition party called the 
national demoratic congress which now controls the remaining six 
seats 
the invasion ousted a hardline marxist regime that came to power 
in a bloody coup against leftist prime minister maurice bishop who 
was assassinated by extremist members of his own government

a piedmont airlines jet whose engine fell off just 
after takeoff had not yet undergone safety modifications ordered by 
the federal aviation administration a federal official said 
saturday 
the official said however that it was too soon to know whether 
the modification could have been a factor in preventing the incident 
friday in which no one was injured 
the right engine tore away from the boeing 737200 jet on 
piedmont flight 1480 as the plane left ohare international airport 
two months earlier the faa ordered all boeing 737200 engines to be 
equipped with additional engine supports 
the modification had not been performed on this airplane 
said william bruce who is heading an investigation for the national 
transportation safety board 
the faa order said the support could be added anytime within the 
next 4000 landings and bruce said he believed the aircraft had not 
made that many subsequent landings 
the engine which fell in a field at the airport was being 
examined at ohare and portions of the planes engine mount were to 
be sent to washington for analysis he said 
the investigation was not focusing on any one possible cause 
bruce said at a news conference at ohare he said he would be 
reviewing maintenance records for the piedmont plane which was 
built in 1981 
fridays incident was the second one of its type in 13 months 
last january the faa ordered airlines to inspect some 
enginemount bolts on boeing 737200 aircraft for cracks after an 
engine fell off a usair flight shortly after takeoff from 
philadelphia on dec 5 1987 said mitch barker an faa spokesman in 
seattle 
the boeing 737200 has two engines one mounted under each wing 
the plane which can carry about 125 passengers is designed to fly 
on one engine said david shipley a spokesman for usair inc which 
owns piedmont

the one remaining engine and no injuries were reported

restaurant owners are taking a dim view of a 
crackdown by fire inspectors who have been by snuffing out candles 
and other open flames in establishments that failed to get the 
required inspection and approval 
there must be another planet we can go to where theyd allow a 
candlelight dinner said marlene pulaski general manager of the 
tin angel a cliffside restaurant and lounge 
it all seems a little preposterous said dan cosagrande 
owner of brandys restaurant how am i supposed to keep a chafing 
dish warm or to use butter warmers for crab legs 
ed zeliesko coowner of tramps downtown said his restaurant has 
been darker since fire inspectors ordered him to remove 
glassenclosed candles from 40 tables 
at first we were astounded when these guys came in with their 
fire hats on zeliesko said ive seen candles in every 
restaurant ive eaten at all over town but its really not funny 
when you realize they could cost you business 
violators also can be fined 1000 
fire capt robert friel said if the restaurants would seek 
permission and an inspection shows they have a good sprinkler 
system and fireproof construction we might be able to give them 
an ok

iran on saturday called for the united 
nations to put pressure iraq so that a permanent truce in the 
persian gulf war can go into effect 
a commentary broadcast on tehran radio and reported by the 
official islamic republic news agency said a deadline should be set 
for putting into effect a un security council resolution that 
calls for troop withdrawals prisoner exchanges and peace talks 
a unmediated ceasefire in the eightyear gulf war took effect 
aug 20 but peace talks that opened in geneva five days later broke 
down immediately 
the commentary monitored in nicosia said the way to ensure 
progress in the peace talks was for the united nations to apply 
corrective discipline to iraq 
the commentary did not mention specific sanctions but appealed to 
un secretary general javier perez de cuellar to think of other 
devices for implementing the resolution 
it also called for more serious international actions to 
pressure iraq into withdrawing from iranian territory it occupied 
during the war and freeing prisoners of war 
the commentary was aired shortly before a special united nations 
envoy jan eliasson was due in tehran in an effort to restart 
stalled peace talks between the gulf war foes 
the swedish un ambassador was to arrive in iran on jan 23 and 
travel to iraq jan 27 
three rounds of peace talks have failed to resolve the deadlock 
over troop pullouts to prewar borders 
un security council resolution 598 calls on iran and iraq to 
halt all military activities and honor the truce withdraw troops 
to prewar borders exchange around 100000 prisoners of war and 
start peace talks 
iran firmly believes a final date for execution of the 
resolution should be set irna reported the radio as saying 
iraq occupies 259 square miles of iranian territory and refuses 
to pull out until iran gives up the right to search ships in the 
gulf for iraqbound war cargo 
iran which has not stopped any iraqi ship since the ceasefire 
insists that troop withdrawals must be the next stage in the peace 
process 
on friday iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz said irans tactics 
were blocking peace talks citing irans refusal to exchange sick 
and wounded pows as a major obstacle to progress in the negotiations 
an exchange of 1158 sick and disabled pows sponsored by the 
international committee for the red cross in november collapsed four 
days after it began amid mutual recriminations over the numbers to 
be repatriated 
a total of 155 iraqi and 56 iranian pows were freed before the 
operation broke down nov 27 
on saturday a senior red cross official said the organization 
will begin monday repatriating 255 iranian prisoners of war that 
iraq unilaterally decided to release earlier this month 
the official arnold luethold told the associated press that a 
plane chartered by the swiss relief agency will fly about half the 
iranian prisoners to tehran on monday 
he said the iranians already have been examined by red cross 
medical staff but declined to say whether all of them are willing to 
be repatriated 
the red cross says it has registered 50182 iraqi and 19284 
iranian pows but estimates the total number of prisoners at more 
than 100000 
before the failed november exchange the two sides had exchanged 
765 sick and wounded iraqi and 613 iranian pows

the government said saturday it will 
still try to recover billions from ferdinand marcos even if he dies 
a key senator said marcos may be allowed to return if he gives back 
money he allegedly stole and apologizes publicly 
the government will not be prejudiced by marcos death 
justice secretary sedfrey ordonez told reporters and it would be 
doubly difficult for his heirs or any appointed administrator of his 
estate to touch his alleged swiss bank deposits 
ordonez made the comment following reports from hawaii that the 
ousted philippine president is in declining health and suffered a 
collapsed lung thursday 
concern over marcos health prompted a federal judge in new york 
to postpone until next month a hearing on whether marcos is too ill 
to be arraigned on racketeering charges 
ordonez said the government could pursue its 35 civil suits 
against marcos estate if the former president dies president 
corazon aquinos government has never filed criminal charges against 
marcos for fear he would demand his right to return to face his 
accusers 
marcos has lived in exile in hawaii since a 1986 
civilianmilitary uprising toppled his 20year administration and 
propelled mrs aquino into power critics say marcos accumulated 5 
billion to 10 billion during his administration 
also saturday the president of the philippine senate jovito 
salonga said marcos might be allowed to return home if he returns 
allegedly stolen funds and issues a public apology as south koreas 
disgraced former president chun doohwan did last year 
if marcos decides to do a chun doohwan that is make a 
public apology seek our peoples forgiveness and restore his 
illgotten wealth there will be enough time for the former 
president and his lawyers to initiate a plea bargaining process 
with the new york courts and prosecutors authorities in 
washington and the government of the philippines said salonga 
salonga added that if marcos decides to insist on his innocence 
and refuses to do a chun doohwan the aquino government may no 
longer be blamed for refusing to consider his return 
chun made a public apology to his country nov 23 surrendered 
assets worth 24 million and went into rural exile in a remote 
temple 
the senate president who formerly chaired a committee leading a 
worldwide search for money marcos is accused of stealing made his 
remarks to a lawyers group in the central port city of cebu the 
associated press acquired a copy of his speech in manila

blacks are twice as likely as whites to have their 
applications for home loans rejected by savings and loan 
associations a newspaper reported 
the records of 10 million applications from savings and loans 
show a lending gap so wide that in much of the country highincome 
blacks are rejected at the same rate as lowincome whites said a 
report in sundays combined editions of the atlanta journal and the 
atlanta constitution 
the journalconstitution said it studied government records of 1 
trillion in loan applications between 1983 and mid1988 at the 
nations 3100 savings and loan associations and mutual savings 
banks which make 50 percent of us home loans 
on the face of it it looks like what you have there is a great 
big red flag said jerauld c kluckman director of compliance 
programs for the federal home loan bank board which regulates 
savings and loans 
the rejection rates were derived from computerized summaries of 
loan applications sorted by race sex and marital status in the 
newspaper study 
the raw statistics were obtained through a freedom of information 
act request 
in settling a civil rights suit 10 years ago the board agreed to 
collect and analyze the statistics each year since it has 
collected the numbers and stored them in a computer but never has 
analyzed them the newspaper said 
loan statistics do not by themselves prove discrimination since 
they reveal nothing about the debt burdens or credit histories of 
applicants but home loan bank board regulations say statistical 
disparities should be examined for clues that might reveal illegal 
discrimination 
i cant argue with the numbers said richard tucker director 
of the bank boards office of community investment clearly weve 
got a problem and the powers that be have got to agree on a way to 
deal with it 
the records show that blacks besides being rejected more than 
twice as often as whites withdraw applications 22 percent more 
often and receive no decision on loan applications 10 percent more 
often 
counting these factors 50 percent of blacks who fill out loan 
applications receive loans compared with 74 percent of whites

six white supremacists marched through downtown 
saturday surrounded by national guard troops in riot gear as 
hundreds of angry counterdemonstrators hurled bricks rocks and 
insults at them 
a halfdozen law enforcement officers were injured as violence 
broke out along the route and in spots throughout downtown after the 
march police reported 42 arrests 
two thousand police officers and national guardsmen surrounded 
the capitol and lined the milelong march route trying to keep 
about 1000 counterdemonstrators away from the white supremacists 
john bankhead a spokesman for the georgia bureau of 
investigation said the counterdemonstrators overwhelmed the 
security forces at some points the white supremacists said they 
completed their march battered from being hit with debris but 
without serious injuries 
i wouldnt call it a riot said public safety commissioner 
george napper who was quickly surrounded by an angry crowd of about 
50 people when he appeared downtown after the march its an 
unusual situation that were going to contain 
he told the crowd the white supremacists had a right to march 
adding theyre entitled to protection its not always easy 
the six marchers were among 10 white supremacists who had rallied 
at the state capitol marking the second anniversary of clashes 
between civil rights marchers and white onlookers in neighboring 
forsyth county 
rally organizer richard barrett a mississippi lawyer and leader 
of the white supremacist nationalist movement had predicted 1000 
supporters would attend his rally and march which also was a 
protest of last weeks observances honoring the rev martin luther 
king jr 
people ask me where are your numbers barrett told the 
nine supporters at the capitol how many people were at kitty hawk 
where the wright brothers made their historic flight i dont 
know but it changed the course of history i have the spirit of 
kitty hawk in my heart 
as barretts group walked from the capitol to near the omni 
sports arena they were surrounded by riothelmeted guardsmen 
massed shoulder to shoulder who covered almost a full city block 
the guardsmen were led by a convoy that included 12 motorcycle 
officers four police cars two dozen officers on foot two police 
buses and two vans 
at the end of the route the marchers were met by dozens of 
youths throwing bottles bricks and other objects the violence 
scattered dozens of curious bystanders including conventioneers in 
town for a homebuilders trade show 
when the convoy turned around and marched back to the capitol 
the melee continued with more rocks and bottles tossed at the group 
after the march hundreds of people milled about at spots 
throughout downtown vandals at the underground atlanta shopping and 
entertainment complex which is under construction threw building 
materials 
police used riot shields and clubs to disperse the crowds and 
several people were seen struck by policemen wielding billy clubs 
by sundown the streets downtown were quiet 
at a city hall news conference napper said he thought police 
handled the days events well he said atlanta historically has been 
able to work out its racial conflicts adding i think thats why 
we havent had the kind of situations that took place in miami 
during the melee a police officer was knocked unconscious by a 
flying rock a national guardsman was injured by a brick that hit 
his foot the georgia bureau of investigation said several of its 
agents were hurt and grady hospital said it was treating two 
officers from the state department of natural resources 
barretts rally and march was billed as a resumption of one 
canceled at the last minute in july by police on the eve of the 
democratic national convention that march was canceled as about 500 
counterdemonstrators gathered and police feared violence 
as troops waited for barretts rally to begin a loudspeaker 
blared a song proclaiming if the south would have won wed have 
it made 
a few blocks away about 1000 people gathered at woodruff park 
to demonstrate against the supremacists participants ranging from 
cleancut emory university students to punk rockers to street 
people were separated from the streets that the white supremacist 
marchers were to take by 100 police officers 
the counterdemonstration was organized by a new yorkbased group 
called the partisan defense committee which bills itself as a 
trotskyistsocialist organization 
gene herson a member of the group said it was not seeking a 
violent confrontation but wanted to make a statement of its own he 
said the white supremacist march was a provocation in a city that 
is predominantly black has a large jewish population and is strong 
in trade unions these are all things the klan is against 
barrett said his rally was intended to repudiate the holiday 
marking kings birthday 
the theme of the march is america arise no king over us 
he said earlier on the steps of the forsyth county courthouse in 
cumming a virtually allwhite community 40 miles north of atlanta 
forsyth county officials refused to permit him to use a podium or 
loudspeakers or to put up his american flag because he was denied a 
permit for a full demonstration 
me without my flag is like castro without his cigar barrett 
told sheriff wesley walraven 
if you had a permit wed let you fly that little old flag all 
over the place walraven said

construction projects worth more than 80 
million are in progress at the federal governments 
uraniumprocessing plant in nearby fernald despite recommendations 
that the facility be closed by 1994 
about 500 of the plants 1264 employees have finished twothirds 
of a sixyear schedule of projects to replace old equipment and 
improve safeguards at the 39yearold plant 
in contrast only 123 of the workers were involved in cleanup of 
radioactive contamination at the facility which processes uranium 
the government refines elsewhere for use in nuclear weapons 
the construction work is defended by the plant owner the us 
department of energy and the plant operator westinghouse materials 
co of ohio both claim the projects will improve environmental 
safety and production at the site 18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
there is no construction that i am aware of that would fall 
under the category of expanding production capability said 
westinghouse spokesman bob walker there are a number of 
improvements and construction projects that while related to 
production are environmental or safetyrelated 
the energy department scheduled 88 million worth of construction 
at fernald from 1985 to 1991 about 7 million worth of projects 
that would have increased production capacity have been canceled 
because demand for uranium at the plant has fallen sharply as other 
government reactors have closed 
a report by the energy department known as the 2010 report 
recommended closing the plant by 1994 former president reagan 
concurred with the report and passed it along to congress 
the recommendation however has no legal force 
were supposed to maintain the feasibility of production until 
were phased out pete kelley a westinghouse spokesman told the 
cincinnati enquirer in a story published saturday 
neighbors of the facility have sued the plants former operator 
national lead of ohio alleging it allowed unsafe amounts of 
chemical and radioactive pollution into the atmosphere putting 
their health at risk and depleting the value of their property 
the energy department has acknowledged the pollution in documents 
filed in the suit pending in us district court in cincinnati 
critics question using money for construction on a plant the 
government wants to close 
its typical money that obviously should be used for 
cleanup is being frittered away on projects they admit will not be 
needed said tom carpenter a spokesman for the government 
accountability project a washingtonbased lobbying group 
bob alvarez a spokesman for sen john glenn dohio said it 
makes no sense to pour money into revitalizing the facility when 
there are problems that will just fester and get worse 
but bruce boswell of westinghouse the plants president said 
the facility must be maintained in good condition because its 
capacity may still be needed 
although the 2010 report says well operate just until 1994 
that doesnt mean everything here will be demolished then kelley 
said and we do have production quotas for the next few years

the failure occurred aboard goes6 a national oceanographic and 
atmospheric administration satellite that was launched in april 
1983 said milton mortman a shift supervisor at the agencys 
satellite operations control center 
its just old age mortman said 
national weather service meteorologist al brown said weather 
mapmaking would be little affected 
for making maps it wouldnt have that much effect brown 
said noting that forecasters rely mostly on conventional ground 
data 
we do things such as help them locate frontal positions 
coming in over the ocean areas its sort of extra input he said 
of the goes6 data 
brown said partial pictures can be provided from a companion 
satellite goes7 that covers the eastern united states 
well be getting pictures from the eastern satellite 
eventually we will move the eastern satellite over so it can cover 
the entire country brown said 
mortman said the process of moving goes7 using small rockets 
mounted to the satellite would be completed around feb 21 
controllers will move the goes7 satellite from its present position 
at 80 degrees west longitude over northern south america to 108 
degrees west longitude 
goes6 is located at 1345 west longitude far out over the 
pacific ocean the two satellites are in stationary orbits 22300 
miles above the equator 
until the satellite is moved weatherwatching also will be 
augmented by other existing satellites operated by noaa and by 
satellites from the european and japanese space agencies said 
thomas n pyke jr noaas assistant administrator for satellite and 
information services 
noaa said goes7 will perform double duty for an estimated 18 
months until mid1990 when the next goes satellite is expected to 
be ready for launch 
mortman said the satellites take cloudcover pictures in narrow 
strips and then compile the pieces to give largescale moving views 
of cloud patterns an encoder lamp that is critical to the 
compilation process failed he said 
without the lamp you have no instrument mortman said

former ku klux klan leader david duke led a 
field of seven candidates saturday to advance to a runoff election 
for a louisiana state house seat representing a mostly white 
suburban district 
duke 38 former imperial wizard of the knights of the ku klux 
klan had 3995 votes or 33 percent he ran as a republican but 
under louisianas open primary system all candidates run on the same 
ballot regardless of party 
the klan is far behind me but the effort for equal rights for 
everybody is ahead of me duke said in a telephone interview 
saturday night 
i think when i win this race youll find candidates across the 
state and across the country begin to talk about the issues im 
raising said duke whose campaign platform included such racial 
issues as welfare reform to reduce black births i think this is 
the beginning of a change in this country 
duke will meet fellow republican john treen in the feb 18 
runoff treen 62 brother of louisianas first republican governor 
since reconstruction came in second with 2277 votes or 19 
percent david treen served four years as governor beginning in 
1980 
in louisiana the top two votegetters go into a runoff election 
if no one wins a majority 
delton charles a republican member of the jefferson parish 
school board was a close third with 2011 votes or 17 percent 
treen and charles both drew endorsements from highprofile 
politicians 
four other candidates split the remainder of the vote they were 
democrat budd olister 1150 or 10 percent republican roger 
villere 1142 or 9 percent republican ron courtade 791 or 7 
percent and democrat bobby savoie 697 or 6 percent 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the special election was to fill a seat vacated by charles 
cusimano who became a state judge the district covers a 
predominantly white neighborhood in jefferson parish a suburb of 
new orleans 
duke left the klan in 1980 after being accused of trying to sell 
topsecret membership lists and set up the national association for 
the advancement of white people he calls himself a white civil 
rights worker 
but his klan activities emerged as an issue during the state 
house race with a report that he has a personal listing under the ku 
klux klan in the telephone directory 
duke said the listing was only to make it easier for people to 
contact him and offered to sign an affidavit swearing he is no 
longer a klan member 
duke mounted a campaign for president last year as a democrat 
party chairman paul kirk wrote to state party leaders urging them to 
do everything legally possible to thwart duke from getting any 
delegates at the 1988 national convention in atlanta 
duke said his presidential campaign was a protest against jesse 
jacksons candidacy 
the state house campaign mostly a race of personalities that 
centered on name recognition and endorsements was mostly quiet in 
the last few days duke blanketed the area with large yard signs 
his campaign echoed the issues he raised in speeches across the 
nation last fall white supremacy through such things as welfare 
reform to reduce black births

president bush put a hardrocking finish to the 
weekend of inaugural parties saturday night at a rollicking bash 
where new republican party chairman lee atwater jammed with a stage 
full of rock n roll legends including ron woods sam moore and 
joe cocker 
the new president after giving a double thumbsup when the 
starstudded performance of high heeled sneakers came to an end 
mounted the stage himself and was presented with a gleaming white 
guitar carrying the legend the prez 
the 64yearold bush got right into the rhythm of things trying 
to follow atwaters fingerwork on soul man but it was all for 
show the gift guitar wasnt plugged in 
at one point the 37yearold atwater an unreconstructed rhythm 
and blues fan from south carolina dropped to his knees then fell 
back to the floor all the while strumming his guitar 
i taught lee everything he knows about that kind of dancing 
joked bush who the night before was pained to take even a few waltz 
steps with the first lady barbara bush and several of their 
children were also at saturdays concert clapping and cheering 
throughout 
listen i want to get this show to keep going that was 
marvelous absolutely wonderful said the president i know when 
to shut up and i know when to say something this is a time to shut 
up 
the big band on stage included steve cropper and others from the 
blues brothers band woods once played with the rolling stones 
moore was famous as part of the soul duo sam and dave 
bushs 32yearold son marvin helped organize the rock affair 
earlier bush showed off his lone star boots to an appreciative 
crowd at a texas black tie and boots affair for thousands of 
members of the texas state society at the washington hilton his 
footgear was black with a map of the state of texas enameled on each 
of them and with a lone star flag in the middle 
i want to show you my boots i dont want ann richards to think 
im not a texan said bush referring to the texas state treasurer 
who delivered an address mocking bush at the democratic national 
convention last july she did not appear to be at the party 
coyly lifting his pants leg bush said hey listen stop 
whistling at me 
several people yelled take em off 
mrs bush who did not address the crowds at any of the numerous 
balls she and her husband visited the night before said what i 
ought to do is make george stand on his head and really show you 
those boots 
bush in what was clearly the understatement of the evening told 
the 9000 young people jammed into the convention center this has 
got to have been the most active event of the inauguration it is 
fantastic 
moore presented the guitar to bush after trying his hand at 
soul man he gave up and waved atwater off 
ladies and gentlemen this is a dream come true youre 
going to hear the greatest of rhythm and blues and soul atwater 
told the crowd before some of the bestknown singers in the genre 
took the convention center stage 
tonight is not the night for politics were going to have 
the time of our lives tonight said the columbia sc native who 
likes to entertain friends with his own guitar playing 
among those who led off the show were percy sledge singing his 
classic when a man loves a woman and coco taylor the socalled 
queen of the chicago blues 
audience members who paid 35 a seat were mostly young wearing 
a range of outfits from black tie to blue jeans and casual clothes 
behind the stage in the center of the hall partygoers packed the 
dance floor to twist and jitterbug to the sounds of the 1950s and 
1960s 
in front of the stage vip guests sipped soft drinks at round 
tables among those attending were marvin bush and dorothy bush 
leblond two of bushs children 
earlier at the black tie and boots event bush told his audience 
and a separate overflow crowd weve had a great wonderful family 
day 
he recalled going home to the white house on friday night for the 
first time looking out the window and seeing people already lined 
up to visit it during saturdays open house 
here were people who spent all night out there under blankets 
or maybe not he said it made me realize just how important it 
is to be the custodian of the peoples house 
and mrs bush who wore a red dress with a black lacecovered 
bodice also turned serious saying just a minute ago when 
george said first lady i dont think so i think im still 
george bushs wife and im darn happy to be living in the white 
house

front of the stage one woman who lost consciousness was kept from 
sagging to the floor by the crush of more than 5000 people around

by all the evidence wall street is expecting 
good things as george bush begins his presidency 
while bush was preparing to take the oath of office last week 
the stock market climbed to new highs since the crash of 1987 
analysts said that wasnt just a coincidence 
stock and bond prices rallied despite tight money and a growing 
risk of recession said erich heinemann chief economist at 
ladenburg thalmann amp co 
in part this was a vote of confidence in the bush brigade mr 
bush has deep roots in the financial community perhaps he will 
bring the bull back to lower manhattan 
during the presidential campaign and in the period after the 
election investors seemed to change their appraisal of the former 
vice president sevberal times 
once the conventions were over and the race came down to two 
candidates the markets registered their decided preference for bush 
over gov michael dukakis 
but by the time the election results were in on nov 8 market 
participants seemed to develop some misgivings over the next six 
trading sessions the dow jones industrial average fell 8889 points 
that selloff wasnt necessarily the result of second thoughts 
about bushs prospects many analysts argued but it did appear to 
signal doubts about what any president would be able to do to shrink 
the federal budget deficit without inducing a recession 
since then traders evidently have grown more optimistic that 
constructive action will be taken 
we think the financial markets care almost as much about the 
politics of the budget this year as they do about the deficit 
said susan simon an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc 
the markets worst fear is that we might have to face a 
protracted stalemate with a president who wont deal 
we think the poker game will be different after reagan bush 
has been in congress and has more congressional ties than reagan 
ever had and he has said he will meet with congress to work out a 
budget 
peter j davis jr washingtonwatcher at prudentialbache 
securities inc says investors may see some surprises as the tax 
and budget negotiations between the white house and congress unfold 
if congress could get ronald reagan to accept a half dozen 
budget packages containing tax increases why shouldnt it expect 
the same result with george bush davis says 
but he adds bush wont relent in my opinion he will prove to 
be a stronger opponent of tax increases that president reagan ever 
was 
the new president he notes has spent much of his career in 
washington he knows how to play the game 
i do not expect congress to bamboozle him into a tax increase 
although maybe around october he might go along with some modest 
sintax increases if congress offers up enough spending to go 
along 
political commentators have remarked that bush has won for 
himself much more of a honeymoon than anyone thought he would 
get in washington and on wall street as well 
as heinemann put it the new administration has made it plain 
it will confront not avoid a host of longfestering issues 
the federal budget the savings and loan crisis drug 
enforcement toxic waste third world debt the list goes on and on 
will all get fresh pragmatic examinations from the bush brigade 
in months to come actions should replace stalemate

super bowl week began with miamis civic leaders and 
promoters eager to show off the vibrant citys new look and with 
most of the black community on the sidelines as usual 
the black problems of disaffection displacement despair 
resentment feelings of injustice and lack of hope were there 
seething but far from the national spotlight or from immediate 
local concern 
then the confusing fatal police shooting of a black motorcyclist 
on the monday night of martin luther king day provided the spark 
that quickly brought smouldering tensions to a fiery rage of violent 
disturbances lasting three days 
now black leaders offended by the initial local focusing on the 
riots damage to miamis super bowl image instead of the reasons 
behind it say the question to them hadnt been why blacks 
erupted again as they did in 1980 riots and disturbances in 1982 
and 1984 
it was when 
here we are once again said willie sims who has served on 
the dade county community relations board since the 1980 rioting 
aftermath the black community takes all these negatives and they 
store them and youve got the powder keg its just a question of 
who would detonate it 
it is almost elementary now said a wearysounding garth 
reeves sr publisher of the blackoriented miami times newspaper 
we keep hoping we learn from the past hopefully were coming 
around to redressing our grievances 
much has changed about miami since it last was host to a super 
bowl 10 years earlier there is a colorful new downtown skyline a 
modern peoplemover system a bayside marketplace of shops and 
restaurants a new downtown convention center and three new luxury 
hotels a new 50 million basketball arena and the football game 
itself will be played in a new stadium north of the city 
a cubanization of miami has transformed it from a southern 
tourismbased resort to a thriving center of latin commerce as 
refugees from fidel castros revolution stopped being exiles and 
exerted financial social and political influence 
the transformation though swept past blacks who account for 
between 20 percent and 25 percent of the countys nearly 18 million 
residents hispanics chiefly cubans account for about 40 percent 
blacks saw their neighborhoods carved up for new buildings and 
roads and felt themselves slipping in the citys new triethnic 
structure from perhaps second to the whites who had run miami to 
third 
its like standing on shore and looking at a body of water 
watching the high tide constantly receding from you over a period of 
10 years said arthur teele a black attorney what you have in 
miami today is a community that has grown dynamically in a way 
perhaps no other city has ever grown and in a short time and what 
you have had is a squeezing out of the black community socially 
economically politically 
a listing in the miami herald last year of the citys power 
brokers was filled with hispanics and nonhispanic whites called 
anglos here city listings of ethnic ownership of businesses have 
put black ownership in singledigit percentages 
black unemployment in dade county in 1987 was 104 percent 
nearly double that of the two other ethnic groups black youth 
unemployment in neighborhoods such as overtown was estimated at 40 
percent to 50 percent 
jobs havent been coming in to the black community but crack 
cocaine has and that has compounded crime 
sims agency compiles a weekly neighborhood tension chart 
using reports from its own staff and some 150 volunteers ranging 
from county judges to bus drivers who are in daily contact with the 
black comunity 
using reports on police incidents crime and what people are 
talking about plus their own experience and sense of the community 
the community relations board staffers assign black neighborhoods 
numbers from 1 to 5 and watch for areas that stay near the crisis 
level of 5 
the levels were staying high sims said thats an 
indication of something seriously wrong 
sims last month became alarmed by a startling series of 
similarities to community concerns in 1980 before the riots that 
killed 18 and did hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage 
in late december he said his staff wrote to the chiefs of the 
miami and metrodade police department and listed comparisons 
for example in 1980 several black officials were under fire 
most notably dade county school superintendent johnny l jones who 
lost his job in march 1980 after being charged with grand theft for 
alleged misuse of school funds a later conviction was overturned on 
appeal but jones eventually served time for solicitation of perjury 
in 1988 several black officials were under fire including us 
district judge alcee l hastings who was acquitted in a 1983 
bribery trial but has been impeached by the us house 
as in 1980 when the metrodade police department was recovering 
from the indictments and trial of former officers accused of helping 
a cocaine kingpin 1988 saw miami police struggling after the 
indictments and trials of officers accused of running a drug ripoff 
ring 
in both years sims said there were several instances of 
controversial police shootings of black suspects and wronghouse 
raids one before the 1980 riots involved a former black 
schoolteacher while one this year involved a black minister 
deepseated economic and social problems were combining with 
feelings that black officials were being singled out for 
persecution that police couldnt be trusted and that they were 
unfairly violent to blacks sims said as he reviewed the community 
relations board letter dated dec 23 
after that letter a federal judge in texas ruled that central 
american immigrants couldnt be forced to stay near the border while 
awaiting us immigration and naturalization service action on their 
asylum requests that led this month to a buslift of hundreds of 
central americans most nicaraguans to miami 
the cuban community identifying with latin refugees fleeing a 
marxist homeland opened up their pocketbooks with donations to help 
the nicaraguans amid predictions the 100000strong nicaraguan exile 
community could double by years end 
to some blacks who had seen more than 100000 cubans come into 
miami in less than five months in the 1980 mariel boatlift that 
began a month before the race riots this was another group coming 
to crowd them further down the city ladder 
some compared the openarms treatment for nicaraguans to the fact 
that many black haitian immigrants are turned away before they reach 
the florida coast or are later deported

the incident that touched off last weeks rioting also bore 
striking similarities to events of the past 
in 1980 the acquittal of metrodade police officers charged in 
the beating death of black motorcyclist arthur mcduffie sparked 
riots in 1982 there were disturbances after the fatal shooting of a 
black youth by a cubanborn miami police officer and in 1984 after 
that officers acquittal 
when it came many blacks scoffed at civic clucking over the 
unfortunate timing of their rage 
these people and their lives were here before the super bowl 
said the rev carlton coleman of new providence church its wrong 
to worry about the incident might hurt the super bowl or will the 
heat basketball team play tonight what about the people in the 
heat neighborhood overtown 
as in the past city leaders responded with promises of speedy 
impartial investigation of the triggering incident and help for the 
underlying problems some black community leaders say the new 
efforts will face skepticism from most blacks 
cubanborn mayor xavier suarez has made improving black 
neighborhoods a top priority since taking office three years ago 
and his predecessor puerto ricoborn maurice ferre had made that a 
theme in the last years of his 12year tenure reviewing miamis 
progress in 1985 ferre said we must also be on the cutting edge 
of solving problems of the poor who live in our ghettos 
recent years have found increased localgovernment aid and loans 
to spur black enterprise job placement services aimed at blacks 
requirements that 25 percent of localgovernment contracts go to 
blacks and appointments of two successive black miami city police 
chiefs 
but the problems are so overwhelming that if we had kept all 
our promises it would have made no difference ferre said last 
week highlevel leadership must be backed by support for blacks by 
the community as a whole he and others said 
it doesnt do any good to start pointing fingers said teele 
a former reagan administration mass transportation official and 
vietnam war hero all of us must shoulder some responsibility 
can the fire next time be avoided 
thats the 64000 question im not in a position to 
predict teele said not if theres not a comprehensive 
commitment to respond to these repeated cries for help

if the stock market is going to do well in the 
first year of george bushs presidency it will have to give him a 
warmer welcome than it has accorded the past several newcomers to 
the white house 
in 1969 when president nixon took office the market dropped 
about 14 percent 
after his successor gerald ford was sworn in in august 1974 
the dow jones industrial average went into a 200point swoon in less 
than two months 
jimmy carter in 1977 was greeted with a 10 percent decline 
even the arrival of ronald reagan with his immense popularity on 
wall street was followed by a 7 percent loss in 1981 
it is a generally accepted view in the financial world that this 
tendency is more than coincidence 
a change of command presumably begets uncertainty among 
investors who pull back until they become familiar with a new 
administration 
furthermore new presidents often use their early months in 
office to take tough measures that would be politically difficult or 
awkward at any other time 
and as it happens 1969 1974 and 1981 though not 1977 were 
recession years 
as 1989 begins the economy is growing with few signs of a 
business slump any time soon stock prices have rallied in the weeks 
leading up to bushs inauguration aided by hopes that he would 
bring a new touch to dealing with some old problems 
nevertheless wall streeters are watching closely to see if past 
patterns repeat themselves 
said suresh bhirud chief investment strategist at oppenheimer amp 
co 1989 is likely to be a very difficult year for stocks and 
bonds 
the us budget deficit is no longer improving the us has 
become a net debtor currently owing 400 billion to the rest of the 
world 
capacity utilization is very tight in the manufacturing sector 
and labor shortages are beginning to surface and there is too much 
debt in all sectors of the economy 
stocks shrugged off such worries in the past week in fact the 
weeks best showing came on wednesday in the face of a government 
report that showed a largerthanexpected increase in the nations 
trade deficit 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed friday at 
223536 up 929 from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 158 to 16116 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
453 to 39162 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 359 at 31952 
volume on the big board averaged 16140 million shares a day up 
from 15357 million the week before 
there has been much talk on wall street of late that president 
bush may well prove more adroit than most chief executives at 
working with a congress dominated by the opposing party 
in particular hopes seem to have increased that a constructive 
plan for dealing with the budget deficit can be worked out 
the prevailing level of optimism about good things happening in 
washington provides a good chance for disappointment in my view 
said greg smith at prudentialbache securities inc 
we must keep in mind that the pace of congress doesnt match 
wall streets the certified optimists in washington feel investors 
could see action on the budget deficit by april or may at the 
earliest 
that is still a long time away for wall streeters 
the stock market does not usually react well to newly elected 
presidents smith concluded but the past record suggests he 
added that after the president has about six months to settle in 
the market usually likes what it is seeing

many investment strategists scrounged to devise 
logical explanations for the curiously cheerful behavior of the 
stock bond and dollar markets in the face of disturbing news about 
the trade deficit 
only a few considered the emotional but just as potent power of 
a presidential inauguration to incite euphoria about the future 
whether justified or not 
perhaps the most confounding event of the past week was the 
market reaction to the commerce department news that the trade 
deficit the most visible symbol of declining us economic might 
surged to 1251 billion in november reflecting a 23 percent drop 
in exports and 42 percent rise in imports 
the report suggested the united states was losing the battle to 
export more and import less a struggle to avoid what some 
economists see as a looming financial crisis based on americas 
habit of spending beyond its means 
it was the sort of news that in months past would have incited a 
heavy selloff in the dollar and sent investors fleeing from 
securities denominated in the currency namely stocks and bonds 
news of a ballooning trade deficit was one of the elements that 
played a role in the october 1987 stock market crash 
instead the dollar surged in hectic trading despite efforts by 
the worlds central banks to stem the rise by selling dollars on the 
open market elsewhere the stock market rallied to a postcrash 
high interest rates eased and bond prices strengthened 
what happened 
many strategists scrambling for answers now reasoned that the 
dollar had been undervalued in the first place some said more 
important economic signs such as strong corporate profits low 
inflation and a decline in borrowing had overshadowed the market 
neurosis over the trade deficit 
others maintained the overall trade deficit was shrinking in 
relation to the countrys total economic output a few even heralded 
what they saw as the reincarnation of the historic bull market on 
wall street 
dollar traders theorized the trade deficit news meant the federal 
reserve would tighten interest rates a signal that they should buy 
dollars but securities traders theorized that the economy was 
slowing and the fed wouldnt have to tighten interest rates so they 
bought stocks and bonds 
suddenly almost everybody was finding good news in the week that 
george herbert walker bush would become the 41st president of the 
united states only a few months after the markets worried about his 
inflexible ban on new taxes indicating an uncertain commitment to 
reducing the trade and budget deficits 
in the chorus of enthusiasm that historically accompanies a 
presidential inauguration only a few economists raised skeptical 
hands 
whats happening in the financial markets is that everybody is 
pretending the deficits arent that important said robert brusca 
chief economist at nikko securities co international nobodys 
paying any attention to the fundamentals because the attention has 
diverted to politics 
in other major business and economic news this past week 
the labor department said the rate of increase in consumer 
prices last year totaled 44 percent matching the 1987 gain but 
private economists said mild increases in energy costs last year 
masked more serious inflation 
the commerce department said housing construction dropped 82 
percent in 1988 to its lowest level in six years but industry 
analysts said the housing industry one of the most sensitive to 
economic slowdowns remained healthy 
chicagos freewheeling commodity exchanges acknowedged a major 
federal sting operation to investigate possible widespread fraud 
fbi agents posing as brokers secretly taped conversations on trading 
floors and reportedly implicated more than 100 people

these are difficult times for those whose 
reputations are based on forecasts of inflation some have been at 
it for more than two years now and month after month they wait in 
vain for fulfillment 
again in december the official consumer price report failed them 
december prices rose just 03 percent the same as in november and 
inflation for all 1988 was 44 percent no higher than a year 
earlier 
inflation of that rate isnt to be ignored of course if 
continued it would cut buying power in half in about 16 years 
apply that to housing prices or education and you can see how it 
might submerge many families 
but while undesirable 44 percent inflation is tolerable for a 
short period and in fact history shows that it is almost 
impossible to avoid from time to time it is not runaway inflation 
which some seers have forecast 
still suffering from the trauma of the 1970s when inflation 
trampled the economies of millions of american households a very 
large segment of the forecasting fraternity nevertheless has made it 
their overriding concern 
for them it is a passion they stand high in the watchtower 
binoculars raised peering over the distance seeking evidence they 
know must be out there each day they scan the horizon for ominous 
shapes 
in recent weeks they have discovered new possibilities taking 
shape 
energy prices for example are likely to rise because of higher 
world prices the 1988 drought has pushed up food costs and prices 
for services especially health care are rising faster than product 
prices 
moreover industrial activity appears to be getting close to 
capacity at the very time the jobless rates has been pushed down to 
a 14year low either one could set the inflation spiral spinning 
faster 
the boston co economic advisors described the threat succinctly 
when an economy is in a fullemployment zone continuing 
price inflation eventually spills into wage costs which through 
downward pressure on profits spill back into prices which in turn 
spill back into wages 
while worrisome however such items and others do not 
necessarily make a case for an important rise in prices generally in 
1989 over the past few years similar scares have evaporated 
sometimes magically true luck was involved 
last year to illustrate oil prices fell during the year 
offsetting food price increases the falling jobless rate did not 
produce wage inflation as widely expected neither did the rise in 
plant and equipment usage 
many economists had stated confidently their belief that if 
industrial activity reached 83 percent of capacity inflation would 
certainly boil over now they have been forced to raise the critical 
percentage the exact level is still unknown but one thing is 
clear it is not what it used to be 
several explanations have been offered for the economy having the 
good fortune to avoid the worst fears of the pessimists 
greater competition in a global economy wage restraint by labor 
more efficient production facilities placed on stream in the past 
decade or so wiser corporate management federal reserve board 
restraint 
monetary restraint which grew tighter throughout 1988 has 
produced an economy that plods rather than races and that slow rate 
of expansion is perhaps the best defense of all against a surge of 
inflation 
meanwhile the pessimists are saying that events are not 
unfolding logically and that we should be getting more inflation 
if not today then certainly tomorrow 
for many of them destructive inflation is a presence in its 
absence they talk about it write about it warn about it and 
confidently forecast that it will come maybe it will and then 
theyll be right finally

by giving banks the right to operate in an area 
off limits for more than 50 years the federal reserve board 
signaled willingness to let banking companies and investment houses 
meet in headon competition 
the feds unanimous decision this past week authorizing five 
large banks to underwrite corporate debt addressed one of the key 
elements of rules designed to reduce risks identified as a cause of 
bank failures during the depression 
limits set by the fed will prevent banks from challenging the 
dominance of big wall street securities firms in the near future 
however the decision eventually will lead to increased competition 
and pinch the profitablity of debt underwriting analysts say 
historical banking functions were separated from securities 
businesses by the 1933 glasssteagall act but in modern times the 
line between the two has blurred as banks have been permitted to 
broaden their activities and investment houses have created 
banklike services such as moneymarket accounts that work like 
checking accounts 
the ensuing turf battle has featured brokerages complaining about 
banks encroaching on their territory while the banks argue that 
times have changed and they should be free to participate in the 
worldwide trend toward universal banking which has led to the 
creation of financial conglomerates offering a wide range of 
services 
even though the feds move greatly expands the type of 
underwriting banks may do it places low limits on the quantity of 
underwriting 
also responding to concerns about concentrating too much power 
among banks the fed spelled out how banks engaging in underwriting 
must structure their operations generally the parent bank must 
refrain from involving itself too closely in operations of 
securities affiliates 
debt underwriting is a crucial link in the process of raising 
money for businesses corporations selling bonds depend on 
underwriters to purchase them and then resell them to the public 
for acting as a marketer in this way underwriters collect fees 
that in recent years have been shrinking as other financing methods 
have gained more widespread use 
last year the value of new corporate debt registered with the 
securities and exchange commission and sold to the public totaled 
about 100 billion industry estimates show 
on deals lately an underwriter can expect to make about 750 
per 1000 of face value of a longterm bond issue so of a 100 
million bond issue the underwriters share would be 750000 minus 
expenses typically netting the underwriter 500000 
robert judge a vice president in the bond trading department of 
nikko securities co international said that as a result of the 
feds decision underwriters might have to settle for smaller 
spreads as more competitors vie for a share of the business 
the five banks given debt underwriting authorization also had 
asked the fed for permission to sell new issues of stock but the 
central bank withheld that power for a year pending a review of the 
banks activities 
the five banks are bankers trust new york corp chase manhattan 
corp citicorp jp morgan amp co and security pacific corp 
john j kriz senior analyst at moodys investors service said 
banks will not make much of a dent in the debt underwriting business 
of the giants that handle most us deals 
in the long term it signifies a trend toward universal 
banking which is what we already have in most european financial 
centers he said adding that in the future it will put severe 
pressure on profits 
from the view of big moneycenter banks the feds latest move 
was significant only so far as it was part of the evolution of the 
industrys financial powers 
it enables them to provide a service in the united states that 
some already have experience with in the eurobond market judging by 
the somewhat unimpressive record of us banks in underwriting debt 
overseas one banking analyst who asked that his name not be used 
said the feds decision wont amount to a hill of beans

they find things in the dark they check 
groceries play concertos and perform eye surgery they are faster 
than a speeding bullet and could do serious damage to a locomotive 
lasers have been the superman of the electromagnetic spectrum 
ever since 1960 when 33yearold theodore h maiman of hughes 
aircraft co built the first one from a pink ruby 
as they near their 30th anniversary though lasers have switched 
from comicbook novelties to necessities that preoccupy the 
technology giants of the united states europe and japan 
lasers are not only in compact disc players and barcode scanners 
at checkout counters they are in the phone system carrying 
longdistance calls over hairthin glass fibers 
now lasers are poised to take a quantum leap tiny devices 
called quantum lasers herald an era in which lasers will be more 
central to the technology underlying daily life 
experts say quantum lasers and their cousins quantum 
transistors could make possible supercomputers the size of 
baseballs and television screens of unparalleled clarity that hang 
on the wall like a painting 
quantum devices are the wave of the future almost all of the 
research that goes on involves quantum effects in some way or 
another said david v lang director of the solid state 
electronics research lab at atampt bell labs 
lasers are what some scientists call a killer technology 
compact discs are killing vinyl records for example and nobody 
uses copper anymore for longdistance phone lines 
to repeat a familiar story the japanese are putting the 
americaninvented killer to use more effectively than americans 
themselves are 
japans dominance of massmarket electronics gives its companies 
unmatched expertise in making things small cheap and reliable for 
example japanese companies dominate the market for cd players 
which use more lasers than any other product 
its a byproduct of the japanese decision to invest in consumer 
electronics theyll find an application and find the technology to 
solve it i wish we did it here said henry kressel a venture 
capitalist at em warburg pincus amp co inc in new york 
japans twin towers of strength in lasers and semiconductors 
could allow it to build the first computers in which chips are 
connected by quantum laser beams instead of electricity that 
worries companies like international business machines corp which 
is intensively studying quantum well lasers and quantum well 
transistors 
at atampt bell laboratories one of americas foremost laser 
research centers alan huang is hoping to leapfrog the japanese but 
he admits the competition is tough for an early model of his 
optical computer he had to use a diode laser he took from a 
japanesemade cd player 
a laser is a directed needle of light purified to one particular 
color or wavelength in contrast ordinary light is a jumble of 
many wavelengths flying in all directions 
laser stands for light amplification by stimulated emission 
of radiation in a cascading effect photons of light strike an 
energized material and stimulate the release of more photons in a 
synchronized pattern 
the most powerful lasers big enough for someone to walk inside 
are being used to attempt to fuse the nuclei of atoms in flashes of 
energy a million times more intense than a nuclear blast sustained 
nuclear fusion could be a source of clean plentiful and cheap 
electricity 
at the other end of the scale are semiconductor diode lasers no 
bigger than a grain of salt the kind used in compact disc players 
and the phone system one exotic subspecies is the quantum laser 
scientists build quantum lasers by spraypainting atoms in a 
layer cake of incredibly thin layers some of which have impurities 
added 
the impure layers act like walls to trap electrons confining so 
many electrons and their receptors holes to a tiny space makes 
it easier to get a cascade of photons going creating laser light 
if a laser the size of a salt crystal were blown up to the size 
of the world trade center in new york a quantum well would be about 
the thickness of a rug in an office said michael ettenberg 
director of the optoelectronics research lab at the david sarnoff 
research center in princeton nj 
quantum lasers are more precise and require less current and 
their efficiency in converting electricity to light is unmatched 
spectra diode laboratories of san jose calif recently produced 
55 watts of continuous wave power from a quantum laser a record 
power output and power conversion efficiency for a semiconductor 
laser president and chief executive donald scifres told the 
associated press this past week 
ophthalmic surgeons have used lasers since 1970 to weld detached 
retinas later came other medical uses like excising tumors and 
eliminating cataracts today lasers snaked into the body on optical 
fibers clean arteries and destroy urinarytract stones 
lasers are used to make pinholes in the nipples of baby bottles 
study components of car exhaust and form the threedimensional 
holograms used on credit cards and maybe someday dollar bills 
the military has star wars designs for freeelectron lasers 
and powerful xray lasers which physicist edward teller has 
suggested could be triggered by a nuclear blast 
laser weapons would most likely be mounted in space people 
tried to shoot laser beams through the sky and what they discovered 
was fog and rain said william bridges of california institute of 
technology 
quantum well lasers fill only one niche but an important one 
their speed and efficiency makes them ideal for rapidfire 
communication initially for longdistance calls later for links 
between neighboring computers and eventually for the links between 
chips in computers said robert melcher a laser expert for ibm in 
zurich switzerland 
ive been in the laser game for 25 years now said one 
researcher ross a mcfarlane of hughes research laboratories in 
malibu calif that quantum lasers is where the future lies

texaco incs sale of its lucrative canadian 
subsidiary marked one of the final steps in a massive restructuring 
since the oil giant emerged from bankruptcy law protection last 
april 
but while observers say they are impressed with the pace and 
execution of texacos restructuring they concede the oil giants 
future remains uncertain 
texaco has made major changes over the last year selling off 
major assets reorganizing internally and shifting its focus to 
exploration and production from refining and marketing 
but despite the changes analysts say texaco has not been able to 
formulate a clear longterm strategy due largely to the cost and 
energy that has gone into battling the power plays of a legion of 
dissatisfied investors led by its largest shareholder carl c icahn 
icahn has been pushing texaco to boost the value of the companys 
stock by selling off assets and this week indicated he might try for 
a second time to wrest control of texacos board from management at 
the may shareholders meeting icahn also has indicated in the past 
he might mount a buyout bid for the oil giant 
texaco the nations thirdlargest oil company behind exxon corp 
and mobil corp announced friday it had signed a definitive 
agreement to sell its 78 percent stake in texaco canada inc to 
imperial oil ltd of canada for 3436 a share or 324 billion 
the deal was the final step in the assetsale portion asset sale 
portion of a major restructuring 
the canadian subsidiary fetched far more than had been 
anticipated bringing the total value of texacos asset sales under 
its restructuring program to more than 7 billion 
texaco has promised to distribute 17 billion in proceeds from 
the sales to shareholders probably in the form of a stock buyback 
analysts say they dont expect texaco to boost the amount of the 
proceeds promised to shareholders but rather raise the common 
dividend to enhance shareholder value over the longer term 
nevertheless now could be the perfect opportunity to weaken 
shareholder support for icahn especially if texaco opts for a stock 
buyback some analysts say 
i believe icahns intention all along has been to sell not to 
buy said michael young an analyst with smith barney harris upham 
amp co 
fridays sale included texaco canadas refining assets but left 
intact much of its exploration and production assets in canada as 
well as in west africa brazil and other areas 
texaco spokesman peter maneri acknowledged that the companys 
focus has shifted to exploration and production side of the business 
thats clearly where texaco is going young said but the 
jury is still out as to whether texaco will have success in the 
exploration business 
in the last two years us oil production has declined by 
approximately 1 million barrels a day due in mainly to a sharp drop 
in oil prices according to the american petroleum institute during 
that time many major oil companies have shifted their focus to the 
more profitable refining and marketing side of the industry 
analysts say texacos turn to exploration and production has 
happened by default due to its financial troubles 
texaco filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 
of the federal bankruptcy laws in april 1987 to avoid having to post 
a potentially ruinous multibilliondollar security bond in its fight 
with pennzoil co 
pennzoil had sued claiming texacos 1984 acquisition of getty oil 
co interfered with pennzoils prior contract to buy part of the 
reserverich getty in 1985 a houston jury awarded pennzoil a 103 
billion judgment 
texaco had appealed the judgment but eventually was forced by 
shareholders to settle with pennzoil for 3 billion 
icahn pressured texaco into a restructuring mainly through the 
sale of assets to boost the companys stock price after the 
companys board rejected his friendly proposal to buy texaco for 60 
a share last year icahn narrowly lost proxy fight for control of 
texacos board 
icahn has continued to increase his stake in texaco and earlier 
this week announced he controls 166 percent of the company icahn 
also disclosed he was considering the possibility of waging another 
contest for board seats at the annual shareholders meeting in may 
nevertheless analysts said they were impressed with the price 
and the terms of the texaco canada sale as well as with the pace at 
which texaco has managed to complete its restructuring 
less than a year since emerging from bankruptcy texaco has 
been able to sell 7 billion in assets and pay down debt by 28 
billion and improve earnings dramatically said young 
when texaco first announced last year that texaco canada would be 
put on the auction block observers speculated the company would 
fetch under 3 billion in the last several weeks that estimate had 
soared 
in addition to the asset sales texaco has cut back operations 
and reorganized management 
other major asset sales in the last year have included its 99 
percent interest in the west german subsidiary deutsche texaco 
ag for 12 billion late last year it completed the sale of 50 
percent of its refining and marketing assets in 23 eastern and gulf 
of mexico states to saudi arabia for 800 million texaco has said 
it expects to realize 18 billion from that joint venture 
partnership with the saudis

technical factors and profittaking have 
depressed the market for crude oil and refined petroleum products 
in moderate trading friday on the new york mercantile exchange 
the february contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude lost 42 cents to 1886 a barrel after rising 
2 cents on thursday 
the contract which was set to expire friday had reached a 
14month high on wednesday after breaking the psychologically 
important 19abarrel level it shot up to 1945 a barrel at one 
point thursday before falling back largely on profittaking 
among refined contracts traded on the exchange friday february 
home heating oil settled 115 cents lower to 5260 cents a gallon 
after falling 086 cent on thursday 
the february contract for unleaded gasoline which declined 016 
cent in thursdays session settled at 5178 cents a gallon friday 
down 032 cent 
peter beutel an energy analyst with elders futures inc said 
fridays price decline was mainly because of technical conditions 
which included profittaking from the earlier rally 
but beutel said the downturn also appeared to show a change in 
market sentiment to one of cautiousness from bullishness 
its a very jittery market right now he said 
oil prices had risen steadily this year on the belief that the 
13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries will abide 
by a productioncutting pact that went into effect jan 1

texaco inc said it has agreed to sell its 78 
percent stake in texaco canada inc for 324 billion cash to 
imperial oil ltd of canada 
the planned sale announced friday would complete a major step in 
texacos postchapter 11 restructuring analysts said it appeared 
that texaco would raise more money than expected from the asset 
sales that are at the core of its reorganization 
torontobased imperial will pay texaco 3436 a share for its 
9418 million shares of texaco canada and agreed to make a 
3436ashare tender offer for the remaining 2659 million shares 
held by 4500 minority stockholders 
the total value of the deal for all 12077 million texaco canada 
shares is 415 billion texaco said 
in new york stock exchange trading texaco rose 87 cents to 
5562 in heavy trading texaco canada closed up 1 at 3412 a 
share on the american stock exchange after a trading halt for part 
of the session 
texaco canada also was expected to issue special common stock 
dividends friday totaling 75 cents a share out of which texaco will 
get 591 million said texaco spokesman peter maneri 
a previously announced special dividend of 650 canadian a 
share to be issued feb 1 will give texaco another 514 million and 
an additional oneforone stock dividend issued to texaco canada 
shareholders in the newlyformed texaco canada petroleum inc will 
raise the total value of the deal for texaco to 39 billion maneri 
said 
texaco canada petroleum was formed late last year to continue 
texaco canadas interest in production and exploration mainly in 
brazil west africa and canada it is not part of the sale package 
imperial 70 percent owned by exxon corp the biggest us oil 
company is canadas largest integrated oil company with 27 
billion in sales in 1987 and 12000 employees 
texaco canada is that nations fourthlargest oil company with 
3200 employees 
the sale package includes among other assets two refineries 
with a combined capacity of 115000 barrels a day and 1800 service 
stations the sale is subject to canadian government approval 
analysts said they were impressed with the price that texaco 
canada fetched as well as with other terms of the deal 
for example texaco will receive an additional 100 million if 
the deal is not completed by march 10 said michael young an 
analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co 
also certain exploration and production properties in alberta 
nova scotia and west africa were not included in the sale as some 
had expected 
the sale could face stiff opposition from those worried about 
growing corporate monopolies however imperial said friday that 
discussions with antitrust officials were under way and it had 
started to divest certain types of assets 
the sale of texaco canada marks one of the final steps in the 
massive restructuring texaco undertook in emerging from federal 
bankruptcy court protection last april 
texaco had hoped to raise some 5 billion in cash primarily 
through the sale of assets with fridays sale texaco tops its goal 
by more than 2 billion analysts said 
texaco promised to issue 17 billion in proceeds from the sales 
to shareholders after being challenged last june in a proxy contest 
by its largest stockholder takeover strategist carl c icahn 
promising the dividend helped texaco win the proxy fight analysts 
said 
james w kinnear texacos president and chief executive said 
friday that announcement of the distribution would be made as soon 
as practical 
icahn again has been pressuring the company to increase the value 
of its stock partly with the dividend payments raised by the asset 
sales sources have said kinnear did not want to sell the lucrative 
texaco canada but agreed to do so to win shareholder support 
icahn who owns 166 percent of texaco said this week he might 
mount another proxy fight to win control of texacos board during 
the annual shareholders meeting in may if the asset sales did not 
produce the shareholder benefits he wanted 
icahn did not return calls friday from the associated press 
imperial beat out a string of other bidders including bond 
corp owned by australian tycoon alan bond and royal dutch shell 
group of the netherlands
