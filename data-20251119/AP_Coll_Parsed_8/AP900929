in the land where high school football is 
as important as oil cattle and chili a traditional crosstown 
rivalry is hotter than ever after a stinging expose a tattling 
coach a lawsuit and death threats 
police patrols were more than doubled for the game between state 
powerhouse permian high school and longtime rival odessa high 
school on friday night and city leaders urged rabid fans to keep 
their cool 
there was a lot of concern that because of anger there could 
be vandalism even violence if we did not pull together as a 
community mayor lorraine bonner said 
permian won 246 and there were no incidents reported 
immediately after the game players from both teams hugged each 
other at midfield after the game as 20000 fans stood in ovation 
before the game a student read a prayer and the schools bands 
played america the beautiful together 
contributing to the pregame tension was action by odessa 
football coach jerry taylor he ended permians chances of 
defendingits state title when he told university interscholastic 
league officials he saw the permian team holding an organized 
practice before the aug 20 starting date 
taylors accusation resulted in permians ban from the 1990 
playoffs and several anonymous death threats against taylor 
attorneys for the permian football coaching staff filed a 
lawsuit against the league friday in hopes of reversing the 
sanctions which included a twogame suspension for coach tam 
hollingshead and a year of probation for the team 
the permian panthers widely known as mojo have won five 
state titles and finished second four times 
permian fans also were angered by hg bissingers book 
friday night lights it depicts a city where racism is rampant 
football gets more attention than english class and school district 
lines are drawn to guarantee the best athletes play for permian 
booksigning appearances by bissinger in this west texas city of 
108000 were canceled last week by bookstore owners after they 
received threats on the pulitzer prizewinning authors life 
some residents claimed bissinger duped them into cooperating 
with assurances he was writing a positive account of local prep 
football along the lines of hoosiers a heroic tale of an 
indiana high school basketball team 
to keep tensions at a low boil odessa high canceled its yearly 
mock funeral procession of permians mascot 
this rivalry was bad enough before all the sanctions came 
down said candy dennis a permian graduate who works at odessa 
high they canceled the panther funeral because they dont want 
any more trouble between the two schools 
the mayor and 14 students from both schools on wednesday 
videotaped a public service message they hoped will reduce 
animosity 
with this appeal we are asking that everyone who goes to 
the game friday night show the real stuff that odessa is made of 
ms bonner said lets show everyone watching and thats going 
to be a lot of people that odessa has a lot of strengths too 
odessa high which has not beaten permian since 1964 was given 
its best chance in many years to beat permian this year the game 
at odessas 20000seat ratliff stadium has been sold out for days 
the citys police department assigned about 50 officers to the 
game where normally we would have no more than 20 said sgt 
jim mckown 
tensions run high for this game even when there isnt all the 
added conflict so there is a real potential for trouble

negotiators for congress and the white house 
opened a finalweekend search on friday for tax increases and 
spending cuts acceptable to enough lawmakers to avert disruption of 
major government services on monday 
by most accounts the negotiators were hung up over two 
perennially tough issues whether and how to tamper with social 
security benefits and whether and how to reuce taxes on capital 
gains 
they were working through the yom kippur holiday on saturday 
and the house and senate scheduled sessions sunday to deal with the 
emergency 
differences were said to be narrowing but nobody was about to 
guarantee agreement before the new budget year begins monday 
there are some remaining issues that are very difficult that 
remain to be resolved said house speaker thomas s foley 
the negotiators quit for the day just before midnight lots of 
issues are left senate republican leader bob dole told 
reporters im optimistic 
members of both parties agreed it will be no easy job getting 
support among rankandfile lawmakers for whatever agreement is 
reached by the leaders 
obviously everybody wants something to pass but very few 
people want to vote for it sen phil gramm rtexas said after 
briefing other gop senators on what negotiators are doing weve 
got a lot of heavy lifting to do to get any agreement enacted 
into law he said 
the best news we could get would be that the negotiators had 
reached an agreement said rep byron dorgan dnd but the 
big question is whether it can pass congress 
delaying costofliving increases in social security benefits or 
increasing the portion of benefits subject to tax both options 
are being considered could weaken support for the package 
especially among democrats 
on the other hand if republicans are unhappy with the 
capitalgains provision or whatever offsetting tax increase on the 
wealthy is proposed to pay for it they might walk away from the 
whole package 
sources in both parties said a recent proposal to exclude from 
taxation any capital gain profit from the sale of an investment 
caused solely by inflation apparently was finding little favor 
among negotiators 
so republicans and democrats exchanged new capitalgains 
proposals on friday 
democrats proposed to exclude from taxation 30 percent of 
capital gains in turn the current maximum 28 percent incometax 
rate on the wealthiest americans would be raised to 32 percent 
republicans pressed instead for excluding 40 percent of capital 
gains while raising the maximum incometax rate on the wealthy to 
31 percent 
capital gains are taxed at the same rates as apply to wages and 
other income president bush is demanding that they be given 
preferential treatment as a spur to investment 
democrats noting nearly 80 percent of such a cut would go to 
those with incomes over 100000 are insisting that any 
capitalgains reduction be offset by raising other taxes on 
highincome americans 
unless congress and bush can agree before monday on a 
deficitreduction package 85 billion worth of arbitrary spending 
cuts will be triggered affecting hundreds of programs though 
sparing others including social security benefits and military 
pay more than 1 million federal workers have been told to expect 
furloughs 
although bush raised the specter of social security checks being 
delayed the social security administration says there is no chance 
of that happening immediately 
october social security checks already have been handed over to 
post offices and should be delivered by wednesday said social 
security spokesman campbell gardett 
the deficit crisis is heightened by the fact that congress has 
not enacted any of the 13 annual appropriations bills although 
congress is planning to pass stopgap legislation continuing 
spending authority until oct 20 bush has said he will veto the 
measure because it also would postpone the acrosstheboard 
spending cuts 
democrats who control the house devised a fallback plan in 
case the fourmonthold deficit negotiators fail to produce results 
by sunday over opposition of republicans the committee cleared 
the way for house action on an alternative budget reflecting 
democratic positions 
rep bill frenzel rminn said that fallback which envisions 
removing the threat of the 85 billion worth of automatic cuts 
would encourage democrats to bob and weave and quote jefferson 
and come to no conclusion 
negotiators are working on a package that would cut the deficit 
50 billion during the 12 months that begin monday and an 
additional 450 billion in the following four years 
any agreement is expected to include higher taxes on alcoholic 
beverages gasoline cigarettes airline tickets and such luxuries 
as highpriced cars and electronic equipment 
tentative agreement also has been reached on medicare cuts 
totaling 60 billion over five years federal workers retirement 
benefits farm support payments and major reductions in the defense 
budget

seventysix paintings seized from imelda and 
ferdinand marcos are not worth the multimillion dollar price tag 
placed on them for auction an arts magazine says 
experts quoted in the october issue of artnews said the artwork 
is not worth the 86 million to 125 million christies auction 
house estimated they will bring at a january auction 
manhattan conservator marco grassi told the magazine that 
galleries sold mrs marcos inferior art at superior prices 
ian kennedy vice president of christies old master paintings 
department stood by the estimates 
of course anybody can disagree with estimates but i am 
perfectly satisfied he said you can tell its not garbage a 
lot of these pictures have been published 
the 76 paintings were seized by the philippine government after 
marcos was ousted and the couple fled to hawaii in 1986 marcos 
died last year 
mrs marcos was acquitted in july of fraud charges prosecutors 
had contended she helped her husband loot their countrys treasury 
of more than 220 million and spent elaborately on art and other 
luxuries 
among the paintings scheduled for auction at christies is one of 
the madonna and child for which mrs marcos paid 700000 she was 
reportedly told that it was by the renaissance master fra filippo 
lippi but artnews said it was really done by zenobi machiavelli a 
lesserknown artist 
christies estimate for the painting was 40000 to 60000 
artnews said the most valuable artworks mrs marcos owned are 
missing including works by monet renoir degas gauguin cezanne 
van gogh picasso chagall and magritte

iraqi atrocities in occupied kuwait could 
prompt the united states to return to the united nations to seek 
tougher sanctions against saddam hussein possibly even military 
action the white house says 
on friday kuwaits exiled emir sheik jabir alahmed alsabah 
gave president bush a harrowing account of what the president 
called a population assaulted incarcerated intimidated and even 
murdered 
the narrative included tales of babies being removed from 
incubators and critically ill patients being taken off lifesupport 
systems so that the hospital machinery could be sent back to iraq 
said national security adviser brent scowcroft 
it was a pretty devastating account especially in the face of 
saddam hussein saying he is the defender of the arabs against the 
outside scowcroft said 
as a result of these reports and other accounts of violence and 
pillaging bush is reviewing the possibility of seeking additional 
united nations action beyond the existing trade embargo and naval 
and air blockades scowcroft said 
the white house official also mentioned iraqi threats to cut off 
food supplies to westerners trapped inside kuwait and iraq after 
the aug 2 invasion 
the whole element of what the iraqis are doing inside kuwait 
to a whole people could conceivably be the subject of another un 
action scowcroft said 
asked if the united states might seek a resolution that 
specifically sought military action to force iraq out of kuwait 
scowcroft said thats one of those things which is 
conceivable 
meanwhile rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed 
services committee said he believes the administration is 
looking more favorably on an early war option 
aspin told reporters he based this assessment on four factors 
the diminishing chances of kuwait regaining its independence 
cooler weather moslems january pilgrimage to mecca which would 
make fighting then more difficult and a more hawkish tone to 
recent administration remarks 
scowcroft noted that one provision of the united nations charter 
that might be called into operation already establishes 
procedures for assembling a multinational military force under the 
un flag 
the presidential adviser noted that the charter allows the 
security council to organize military actions against a nation if 
other sanctions prove to be inadequate 
scowcroft said however that bush did not plan to include an 
appeal for further united nations action against iraq during his 
visit to the world body this weekend 
the president was flying to new york today for a un conference 
on childrens diseases and hunger he will address the general 
assembly on monday 
after his luncheon meeting with the exiled kuwaiti ruler on 
friday bush told a departure ceremony on the white house lawn 
what normally would be a pleasurable occasion instead is a time 
for sobriety and sorrow 
bush reiterated his commitment to seek to isolate saddam the 
iraqi president and force withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait 
his highness and i agreed that we must keep all our options 
open to ensure that iraqs unlawful occupation of kuwait is ended 
and kuwaits legitimate government restored bush said 
iraq will fail he declared 
for his part the exiled emir praised bush for showing a 
principled courageous and decisive position in the face of iraqi 
aggression and said he hoped the president would one day be able 
to visit him in liberated independent kuwait 
the white house meeting was intended as a clear sign that the 
united states still regards the 64yearold emir as the legitimate 
ruler of kuwait 
bush has consistently insisted that not only must iraq withdraw 
its invasion troops from kuwait but that the emir must be restored 
to the power he has wielded since 1977 
several hundred prokuwaiti demonstrators across pennsylvania 
avenue from the white house erupted into excited cheers as bush and 
the emir briefly waved to them from the front portico 
briefing reporters on the meeting scowcroft said a peaceful 
resolution to the persian gulf crisis remained in everyones best 
interest 
the sanctions have not been in place very long he said 
but he added there is no question that whats happening 
inside kuwait affect the timetable there is no question about 
that but i think we need to at least come to a sincere judgment as 
to whether or not theres a peaceful way to resolve this 
an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said a request might come before the united nations within a week 
or so likely at the request of kuwait for a resolution condemning 
iraqs treatment of kuwait

the bush administration is moving ahead with a 
test sale of 5 million barrels of stockpiled oil despite 
contentions by lawmakers and its own energy secretary that the 
amount is too small 
the energy department sent out formal notices of the sale friday 
as the house voted to give president bush authority to triple its 
size as recommended a day earlier by energy secretary james 
watkins 
the white house stopped short of disavowing watkins suggestion 
that the 5millionbarrel sale announced by bush on wednesday was 
too small to even test how the 590millionbarrel strategic 
petroleum reserve might work in an oil emergency 
wed have to look at any proposal to expand it said steven 
hart a white house spokesman 
but watkins testimony and the houses prompt response to it 
amid a doubling of crude oil prices since july left the 
administration scrambling to find a single policy voice on using 
the reserve 
although the embargo against iraq and kuwait removed 43 million 
barrels of oil daily from the world market large inventories and 
shipments already on the ocean have prevented any actual shortages 
from developing so far 
but the anticipation of shortages as winter approaches and 
commercial stocks begin to decline has sent prices from about 21 a 
barrel when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 to 39 this week 
the administration contended for nearly two months that the 
reserve built at a cost of 20 billion to taxpayers after the 1973 
arab oil embargo was never intended to counter escalating oil 
prices 
however white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
wednesday that one of the purposes of the test is acting against 
what we believe is speculation in terms of unwarranted price 
increases 
lawmakers have embraced claims by market analysts that bush 
could have stopped the price spiral at 25 to 27 per barrel by 
tapping the reserve last month at a rate of 500000 barrels a day 
since aug 2 4 billion more in energy prices have been paid 
by american consumers than should have been rep edward markey 
dmass said friday businesses are being driven into recession 
by this headinthesand energy policy the administration has 
adopted 
the energy department has the capability to pump up to 35 
million barrels of oil a day from the stockpile which is stored in 
salt deposits along the louisianatexas coast 
rep wj tauzin dla who guided a bill authorizing a 
15millionbarrel test sale through the house on friday said the 
administration had vowed just two weeks ago that bush would veto 
legislation with a test sale above 5 million barrels 
watkins however told the house energy and commerce committee 
on thursday that a 15millionbarrel test was needed 
its our belief the secretary of energy was correct tauzin 
said there are no shortages but fears of shortages are allowing 
speculators on wall street to drive up prices and take advantage of 
consumers 
sens joseph lieberman dconn and carl levin dmich 
introduced a senate bill friday for a 15millionbarrel sale 
the road in the senate may not be so smooth said an 
administration source who acknowledged efforts under way there to 
prevent a vote on the proposal 
meanwhile the energy department said it will open bids on the 
5millionbarrel sale oct 5 and sign the first contracts with the 
successful bidders a week later for an average daily release of 
167000 barrels 
if a buyer can arrange for a tanker to be at the dock we 
could load oil the next day said doe spokesman bob porter but 
we expect most of these deliveries to occur in november 
potential buyers will have to bid for minimum quantities of 
200000 barrels if delivery is to be by tanker 75000 barrels by 
pipeline and 40000 barrels by barge

backers of legislation to reregulate cable 
television prices and services say that despite a senate defeat 
theyll be back next year with an even tougher bill 
sen timothy wirth dcolo on friday objected to bringing the 
bill to the floor for debate or a vote where it was expected to 
pass easily faced with a possible filibuster a sponsor of the 
bill sen daniel inouye dhawaii declared the measure dead and 
buried for the 101st congress 
congress is expected to adjourn as early as the middle of 
october 
backers of the bill said the cable industrys victory may be 
shortlived and that it would only strengthen the hand of wouldbe 
competitors 
home satellite companies are itching to compete with cable and 
are expected to push provisions of the senate bill that guarantee 
them access to cable programming broadcasters also want cable to 
pay for the programming it now takes virtually for free 
there may come a time when the cable industry will devoutly 
wish they had taken todays deal said edward o fritts 
president of the national association of broadcasters 
this bill was like inpatient surgery on the cable industry 
dealing with surface wounds said gene kimmelman legislative 
director of the consumer federation of america my guess is that 
next years bill is going to be like heart and brain surgery 
combined 
the office of management and budget had issued a veto warning on 
the bill which would have restored some of the government 
oversight of cable that congress lifted in 1984 
omb said the bill imposed too many restrictions on cable and 
that increased competition perhaps from the telephone industry 
was the answer to any problems in the cable industry basic cable 
prices on average have risen 43 percent in the past three years 
wirth said service and prices had been the driving forces behind 
the bill but we have gone far beyond that there are some 
provisions in there that dont have anything to do with rates or 
service 
cable executives had said they could live with some form of rate 
reregulation but they bitterly opposed provisions that would have 
imposed strict business restrictions on their industry including 
banning exclusive programming contracts 
nonetheless the bill had been expected to pass by a wide 
margin a similar version sailed through the house on a voice vote 
earlier this month 
consumers are outraged and we have the opportunity to do 
something about it and we will do something about it next year 
said sen john danforth rmo one of the bills architects but 
as for now the cable companies have won they get to increase the 
price of service and allow the quality of service to deteriorate 
until the congress acts 
the legislation would require cable systems to provide a basic 
tier of local broadcast and public tv channels and require the 
fcc to monitor rates for cableowned programming such as mtv 
the house bill would prohibit programmers owned by cable 
operators from unreasonably refusing to deal with competitors 
and require them to provide their signals to backyard satellite 
users

the forest service says saving the northern 
spotted owl from extinction will require banning logging next year 
on 3 million acres of the northwests oldest forests 
and some lawmakers while fearful of the impact on timber jobs 
say they are optimistic that adoption of a credible protection plan 
will help avert environmental lawsuits that threaten to bring the 
regions logging to a standstill 
concerned that its current protection plan may violate the 
endangered species act the forest service announced friday it will 
follow instead the recommendations offered in april by one of its 
biologists jack ward thomas and a panel of government scientists 
congressmen said the move will mean greater cuts in logging than 
the white house predicted last week 
the forest service estimated last spring that the thomas plan 
would cause federal timber harvests in the northwest to fall by 
nearly 50 percent and result in the loss of more than 20000 
logging jobs 
however president bush last week endorsed a finding by a white 
house task force that the owl could be saved from extinction by 
reducing next years harvests by only about 20 percent from this 
years 385 billion board feet to about 3 billion board feet 
rep denny smith rore said fridays announcement by the 
forest service means that harvests will tumble to about 26 billion 
board feet this is just a further cavein to the folks that are 
trying to put us out of business said smith a strong supporter 
of the timber industry 
the action came as environmentalists were preparing to return to 
federal court in seattle to try to force the forest service to 
accept a scientifically sound plan to protect the spotted owls 
habitat in the northwests oldgrowth forests 
the fish and wildlife service on june 22 declared the rare owl a 
threatened species under the endangered species act an estimated 
3000 pair live in the pacific northwest their only habitat 
lawmakers said the thomas proposal would be the most sweeping 
protection of wildlife in the history of the act banning logging 
on 3 million acres of national forests currently open to harvests 
an area larger than the state of maryland 
rep norm dicks dwash said implementation of the thomas plan 
should help prevent an onslaught of environmental lawsuits that 
could block the sale of much greater amounts of timber 
todd true an attorney for the sierra club legal defense fund 
said the action was overdue certainly it is appropriate that the 
old plan has been thrown out and recognized as the poor job it 
has always been the environmental lawyer said 
but evelyn badger of the proindustry oregon lands coalition 
said the announcement means that forest service chief dale 
robertson has just signed eviction notices for tens of thousands 
of families in the northwest 
the thomas plan will remain in force until congress adopts 
another plan or the fish and wildlife service adopts a permanent 
recovery plan for the owl

darkness hampered a coast guard effort to 
determine the extent of a petroleum spill from a collision friday 
between a tanker and a barge authorities said 
a tanker struck one of two barges being towed by a tugboat in 
the houston ship channel where about 700000 gallons of oil 
spilled in a july accident the coast guard said 
the leaking barge contained reformate a volatile colorless 
liquid product of petroleum distillation that is used as a 
manufacturing solvent a drycleaning fluid and a gasolineblending 
stock 
the coast guards marine safety office in galveston said the 
collision occurred at 9 pm about 3 miles east of a galveston bay 
beach 
details remained sketchy early today no injuries were reported 
coast guard cmdr frank whipple said darkness prevented 
authorities from determining the extent of the spill 
the 538footlong norwegian tanker designed to carry a chemical 
cargo of undetermined size was not damaged whipple said 
a slick formed from the leaking barge and a spill response team 
from contractor garner environmental co of houston was sent to the 
spill he said 
the collision occurred as the tanker was leaving houston and the 
297footlong barges both loaded with reformate were coming in 
whipple said 
the tug was able to push the barges out of the channel and up 
onto the bank whipple said they are resting on the bank 
the july 28 collision between the greek tanker shinoussa and two 
barges in the ship channel spewed crude oil into the 
environmentally sensitive bay 
on june 8 the norwegian tanker mega borg was rocked by an 
explosion about 58 miles offshore from galveston dumping more than

the armys apache antitank helicopter needs 
repairs after an average 2 hours in the air during peacetime and 
may be useless in war say congressional investigators 
the apaches seeinthedark electronics 30mm cannon guided 
missiles and rockets make it a powerful tank killer when in 
operation it has been deployed to saudi arabia in operation desert 
shield 
the army has ordered all but 66 of 807 apaches it planned to 
purchase from mcdonneldouglas corp for 12 billion 
but the general accounting office in a report issued friday 
said rather than buy more of the helicopters the army should beef 
up the maintenance organization devoted to the aircraft 
a similar gao recommendation was made in april when the army 
had 132 choppers to go but another 66 helicopters were bought 
anyway 
investigators said the army has too few apache mechanics about 
100 maintenance personnel assigned to an apache battalion take care 
of 39 helicopters including 18 apaches the marine corps however 
achieves far more flying hours with 225 technicians taking care of 
24 simpler helicopters 
the gao said in april that apaches were fully mission 
capable only about half the time far short of the armys 70 
percent goal the figure was repeated in fridays report 
why buy more headaches richard davis director of the gaos 
army issues group asked in an april appearance before congress 
use the money to operate and fix existing apaches 
given that the apache has not been able to attain availability 
goals in peacetime despite favorable conditions it is questionable 
whether it can meet the far more strenuous demands of 
highintensity combat the gao said in the friday report 
the gao said the aircrafts electronics fault detection system 
about 40 percent of the time detects a fault that does not actually 
exist 
in addition soldiers maintaining the apache spend only about 30 
percent of their time repairing the aircraft they spend the rest 
of their time on required assignments such as guard duty physical 
training motor pool detail marksmanship testing and other such 
tasks for this reason reenlistment rates are low and experienced 
mechanics rare in apache battalions 
components fail at rates far higher than expected when the 
aircraft was designed for instance the main rotors must be 
replaced every 164 hours instead of lasting 1500 hours gao said 
according to the gao the armys commander in europe has said 
as much as 50 percent of the time apaches spend in the hangars 
for maintenance is devoted to troubleshooting and that this time 
was increasing 
in an aug 31 letter to the gao david j berteau principal 
deputy assistant secretary of defense for production and logistics 
said the agencys findings mostly portray the readiness and 
support problems of the apache helicopter of about 1824 months ago 
and were not new to the army 
maj nancy burt said friday that the army and mcdonnell douglas 
had identified 173 problems resolved 106 and are fixing 67 
burt also said that apaches sent to the persian gulf have exceed 
the services goals for capability 
in april gao officials testified that the army handpicked six 
of its best apaches for the invasion of panama last december 
one helicopter never took off because of a hydraulic failure 
the fuel cell failed in another and still another was forced to 
return to the base when its target detection system didnt work 
the gao said 
complicating matters were the helicopters sensitive electronic 
components that failed to work when rain and humidity caused a 
build up of moisture army officials were forced to dry the parts 
in kitchen ovens the gao said 
the gao report was requested by rep les aspin dwis chairman 
of the house armed services committee and rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce committee and 
its panel on oversight and investigations

millions of iranians on friday protested the usled forces in 
the persian gulf with chants of death to america and iraq 
warned that war in the region would ravage other arab states and 
israel 
also friday britain began sending some of the 6000 ground 
troops it promised to add to the forces in the saudi desert the 
defense ministry in london said 
president bush promised the exiled leader of kuwait that his 
country will not remain under iraqi control 
kuwaits sovereignty and territorial integrity will be 
restored bush said after meeting with sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah the white house meeting was intended as a sign that the 
united states still regards the emir as the legitimate ruler of 
kuwait which iraq invaded aug 2 
a bush aide said the graphic account of the iraqi occupation 
that the exiled ruler gave bush could lead the president to push 
for tougher un action against saddam hussein including 
unbacked military action 
thats one of those things thats conceivable said brent 
scowcroft the presidents national security adviser 
alsabah described terrifying conditions in kuwait 
including soldiers taking patients off life support systems and 
removing babies from incubators so the equipment could be shipped 
back to iraq scowcroft said 
rep les aspin the chairman of the house armed services 
committee said he feels the administration is looking more 
favorably on an early war option 
the wisconsin democrat said he based this assessment on four 
factors the diminishing chances of kuwait regaining its 
independence cooler weather moslems january pilgrimage to mecca 
which would make fighting then more difficult and a more hawkish 
tone to bush administration remarks 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia said millions of iranians 
staged demonstrations nationwide denouncing the united states and 
israel 
we have seen how they have defiled our sacred lands the land 
of divine revelations just as they did in jerusalem by bringing 
corruption devastation godlessness and debauchery to that 
hallowed region a reporter said in a live report from the tehran 
rally 
iran has condemned iraqs invasion of kuwait but it also has 
deplored the usled forces sent to protect saudi arabia and 
enforce a unimposed embargo against baghdad it says it is 
honoring the blockade however 
the protests capped a week of celebrations marking the 
anniversary of the beginning of the 198088 iraniraq war iran 
sees cause for celebration because last month baghdad caved in to 
its demands for peace ending two years of deadlocked talks some 
observers say that in return baghdad expects iran to circumvent the 
embargo and deliver food to iraq 
iraqs government newspaper aljomhouriya again warned about 
widespread devastation if war broke out the battle arenas would 
be multiple and the fires would devour all oil fields the zionist 
entity and agents of america in the region it said in an 
editorial 
the newspaper was referring to israel and egypt syria morocco 
and arab gulf states cooperating with the united states in the 
multinational buildup following the invasion of kuwait 
british ground forces bound for the gulf began leaving ports in 
britain and germany the defense ministry said in london 
initial estimates put the number of troops of the 7th armored 
brigade and support units being sent to the gulf at between 6000 
and 8000 but the times of london said saturday that the number 
could reach 9000 
three thousand british military personnel aboard ships or with 
air force fighter units are already in the gulf 
the main weapon of iraqs opponents in the gulf standoff has 
been the economic embargo imposed by the united nations the world 
body this week extended the land and sea blockade to the air foreign 
ministers from the united states britain china france 
and the soviet union met with un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar and released another statement condemning the iraqi 
invasion while emphasizing their commitment to seeking a peaceful 
solution 
chinese foreign minister qian qichen addressed the issue in a 
speech to the un general assembly in which he omitted chinas 
standard opposition to big power involvement in the gulf 
western diplomats said the omission could reflect greater chinese 
acceptance of and possibly support for the us military buildup 
in saudi arabia 
the commander of the american battle group patrolling outside 
the gulf said friday he doubted that ships were evading it by 
hugging the iranian coast 
personally i feel that we are being 100 percent effective 
said rear adm jerry unruh iraq may be loading their ships with 
oil but their ships are not coming out 
turkey enforced the air embargo by searching indian soviet and 
polish planes bound for baghdad 
in paris representatives of the united states and 20 
industrialized nations met to discuss how to replenish oil supplies 
if they are depleted by the crisis 
the nations are members of the international energy agency 
which issued a communique that said it was preparing to protect the 
west from an oil supply crisis but that there was no immediate need 
to use strategic reserves to offset embargoed oil from iraq and 
kuwait if a significant oil shortfall develops the board will 
hold an emergency session the communique said 
investor fears sent some stock markets plunging 
stock prices dropped to the lowest point in 3 years in tokyo 
and analysts blamed fear of war in the middle east high interest 
rates and climbing oil prices 
the us government said its main economic forecasting gauge 
the index of leading economic indicators declined 12 percent in 
august following the iraqi invasion of kuwait the steepest drop in 
three years 
in other developments 
the iraqi news agency said radical palestinian leader mohammed 
abbas vowed to strike american interests if any iraqi aircraft were 
attacked to enforce the air embargo 
a grenade attack killed the 9yearold son of a french soldier 
and wounded 17 other people in the red sea nation of djibouti 
which has served as a staging ground for french forces in the 
persian gulf officials said 
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack 
thursday night and it was unknown wether it was linked to the gulf 
crisis 
spain and south korea joined other nations in pulling envoys 
from embassies besieged by iraqi troops in kuwait 
bulgaria has offered to send 400 troops to the gulf the us 
state department said the poles czechs and romanians have offered

an environmental activist group is seeking a 
federal court order to stop the scheduled launch next week of the 
space shuttle discovery with the nuclearpowered ulysses sun probe 
in its cargo bay 
we have an extraordinary risk here from an agency whose 
competency in the last year has been abysmal said andrew c 
kimbrell a lawyer for the foundation on economic trends which 
asked friday for a preliminary injunction 
the organizations motion is the latest round in a legal battle 
begun last year when the national aeronautics and space 
administration dispatched the galileo probe to jupiter from shuttle 
atlantis 
at that time us district judge oliver gasch refused to stop 
the launch and galileo was sent on its way 
the foundations friday motion was made part of that earlier 
suit brought by the florida coalition on peace and justice the 
coalition staged a demonstration last saturday at the kennedy space 
center 
it was not unexpected said nasa general counsel edward 
frankle its basically similar to the one that was done last 
year in galileo and i hope it has the same result 
both planetary probes use electricity generated by decaying 
radioactive pellets of plutonium238 which causes cancer and death 
in humans if inhaled 
the united states has launched 23 missions with nuclear power 
sources three have had accidents including one that released 
radioactive materials nasa said the risk with ulysses is minimal 
galileo carried 496 pounds of plutonium to provide power for 
the 15 million probe on its sixyear journey during which it 
will twice fly close to earth for added momentum 
the ulysses probe which is to be ejected from discoverys cargo 
bay hours after the shuttle launch oct 6 carries just under 237 
pounds of plutonium238 which kimbrell called one of the most 
toxic substances known to man 
the current complaint restates the risk of a challengerlike 
explosion on launch and introduces an element not present last 
year the fuel leaks that three times have stopped the launch of 
shuttle columbia since may nasa has grounded the shuttle until an 
investigative team solves the problems 
until nasa shows it can become competent again it should not 
be in the business of putting nuclear fuel in space kimbrell 
said 
the motion to gasch says the challenged launch comes at a time 
of crisis and confusion at nasa it said the agency is being 
criticized in congress and elsewhere for unreliability in 
predicting mission goals and risks and lack of quality control 
basically we are saying where are their studies on where the 
hydrogen leaks are coming from kimbrell said where are the 
hard numbers on radiation risks on actual risks of a shuttle 
explosion 
the government has until tuesday to respond

one of the most intriguing political 
realignments triggered by the persian gulf crisis is the one 
between king hussein of jordan and radical plo factions he has 
feuded with for 20 years 
george habash of the popular front for the liberation of 
palestine and nayef hawatmeh of the marxist democratic front for 
the liberation of palestine were feted as heroes when they returned 
to jordan last week for the first time in two decades 
they left as the sworn enemies of hussein but returned to amman 
as allies thrown into his arms by political fallout in the wake of 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
hussein has pledged to honor the un sanctions against iraq 
but the king steered clear of a confrontation with saddam hussein 
jordan is heavily reliant on iraq for trade and cheap oil 
jordans 3 million palestinian residents half its population 
strongly back saddam who has positioned himself as the champion of 
palestinians in the territories occupied by israel 
meanwhile the palestine liberation organization led by yasser 
arafat has turned away from syrian president hafez assad a 
traditional foe of saddam who has sent troops to bolster the 
multinational force in saudi arabia 
the warm reception for habash and hawatmeh in amman last week 
appalled the us state department 
habash described his meeting with the monarch at his palace 
sept 18 as cordial we came out with the impression that we 
share the same political ground were facing a common danger 
he told reporters 
habash and hawatmeh were received by the king more as old 
friends rather than former deadly enemies a senior jordanian 
official said 
you wouldnt have thought that 20 years ago the two 
palestinians were fighting to topple the king or have him 
assassinated said the official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
many palestinians had moved into jordan after the 1967 war in 
which israel occupied the west bank and gaza in 1970 habashs 
guerrillas hijacked three airliners and blew them up in the 
jordanian desert after evacuating the passengers 
hussein fearing that the growing power of the plo threatened 
his hashemite throne and was drawing punitive israeli military 
strikes against jordan decided to move against them 
habash and hawatmeh fled amman on sept 30 1970 after 13 days 
of fierce housetohouse fighting between palestinian guerrillas 
and king husseins tough bedouin troopers 
the palestinians suffered close to 10000 casualties during 
black september and began referring to the king as the 
butcher of amman government forces lost more than 600 dead and 
1500 wounded 
many of the palestinians leaders dispersed to damascus or 
lebanon where their heavily armed presence and alliance with 
leftist moslems contributed to the outbreak of the lebanese civil 
war which continues today 
ironically king hussein could yet find his throne in danger 
again 
he has already paid a high price for his support for iraq saudi 
arabia last week cut off financial aid worth 300 million a year to 
the economically strapped kingdom and blocked oil deliveries 
political and diplomatic sources in amman believe that any 
attempt by the king to adopt a more proamerican stand would spark 
off massive protests that could endanger the throne 
crown prince hassan the kings brother complained friday of a 
lack of understanding from the west jordan was respecting 
sanctions he said even though it has meant a 50 percent decline 
in the gross national product 
is it expected that jordan commit economic hari kari he 
said during a conference in washington are we expected to commit 
economic suicide

east lansing mich ap zimbabwe president robert g mugabe 
at a ceremony in which michigan state university gave him an

weary congressional and bush administration 
officials headed today into what could be a lastditch attempt to 
fashion a deficit reduction agreement and avoid massive cuts in 
federal services monday morning 
lots of issues are left senate republican leader bob dole 
of kansas told reporters after a lengthy session ended late friday 
night 
dole added im optimistic we are committed to getting it 
done 
a source familiar with the negotiations said republicans 
indicated they might be ready to give up their insistence on a 
capital gains tax cut demanded by president bush the issue that 
has been the source of most of the debate during the more than four 
months of budget talks democrats have claimed that the tax which 
is charged against the profits on property sales is of primary 
benefit to the rich 
the source who spoke only on condition of anonymity said the 
bargainers tentatively agreed to scale back a planned increase in 
taxes on beer wine and liquor and to impose some new limitations 
on the total amount of itemized deductions allowed for high income 
couples and individuals 
the house and senate scheduled rare sunday sessions in 
anticipation of an agreement that would cut the deficit by about 
50 billion during the budget year that begins monday and by 
another 450 billion in the following four years 
monday could be chaotic for federal workers and for users of 
many government services unless a deficit reduction package is 
produced if no agreement is in place 85 billion in arbitrary 
spending reductions will be forced on hundreds of government 
programs ranging from meat inspection to air traffic control 
social security military and congressional salaries and many 
initiatives for the poor are exempt from the cuts 
but more than 1 million of the 21 million civilian federal 
workers already have received notices that they will be furloughed 
up to 22 days during the next year the office of management and 
budget told agency heads friday that all employees should report to 
work on monday and those considered nonessential would be sent 
home 
the situation is made worse by the fact that congress has failed 
to enact any of the 13 annual appropriation bills for the new 
budget year lawmakers are ready to approve stopgap legislation to 
extend spending authority for another 20 days but bush has 
promised to veto the measure unless it is striped of a provision 
postponing the mandatory 85 billion in cuts until oct 20 
the president insists that the pressure of mandatory cuts is 
necessary to force agreement on a package of targeted spending 
reductions and tax increases 
among the most contentious issues still to be resolved is 
whether social security beneficiaries should be made to pay a 
greater share of the deficit reduction cost one proposal under 
consideration would increase from 50 percent to 85 percent the 
share of social security benefits on which higher income recipients 
could be taxed another would delay for two or three months the 
jan 19 1991 cost of living increase in benefits

the bush administration not wanting to 
alienate china refused taiwans offer of about 100 million to 
help pay for the military buildup in the persian gulf a newspaper 
reported today 
the united states wants to remain on good terms with china 
which has one of five permanent seats on the united nations 
security council the los angeles times reported in todays 
editions 
the united states has depended on china in the security council 
to support sanctions against iraq for its aug 2 invasion and 
subsequent annexation of kuwait 
taiwan made its 100 million offer through its vice foreign 
minister cj chen during his recent visit to washington the times 
quoted unidentified diplomatic sources as saying 
us officials have sought donations from other countries to pay 
for the deployment of thousands of american troops to saudi arabia 
and the persian gulf region 
but the administration refused the taiwanese offer not wanting 
to upset beijing which has always opposed any official recognition 
of the taipei government the newspaper said there was no 
immediate administration response to the report 
a spokesman at the taiwanese coordination council for north 
american affairs in washington would neither confirm nor deny the 
offer 
speaking hypothetically even if we did make an offer and it 
was turned down we would be understanding the unidentified 
spokesman said if the sanctions fail to take effect the 
administration will still need the communist regimes 
cooperation 
however the times said some sources indicated the taiwanese 
government was angered by the rebuff 
us officials apparently told taiwan to give the money instead 
to egypt jordan and turkey but vice foreign minister chen did not 
want to do this the times said 
taiwan recently announced it would give 30 million to those 
countries 
president bush and national security advisor brent scowcroft met 
with former chinese ambassador to the united states han xu two 
weeks ago 
han a friend of bushs came seeking a renewal of highlevel 
contacts between the two countries that were broken after chinese 
soldiers attacked prodemocracy demonstrators in beijings 
tiananmen square in june 1989 hundreds were left dead

the wisconsin performs its mission today on the doorstep of an 
aggressor it is a constant highly visible reminder of the peril

the musket factory in which eli whitney 
introduced mass production to the world has been reborn as a 
working museum where children can learn the importance of 
manufacturing by making toy soldiers 
at the site where in 1798 the inventor began to beat his 
competitors with the revolutionary production concept that helped 
arm the federal government the goal now is 25 toy soldiers 
produced by 25 youngsters in 25 minutes 
ask me in a couple of weeks if we can do it said william 
brown director of the eli whitney museum the exhibit opened 
sunday 
whitney fresh from a disappointing attempt to profit from his 
cotton gin set up the musket factory in a small barn along the 
mill river just north of new haven 
the museum thought a working exhibit would be the best way to 
demonstrate whitneys genius 
kids are taught that factory is a dirty word brown said 
we wrongly equate factory work with degrading repetitive labor 
our goal is to help kids realize that this is a good and noble 
tradition 
twentytwo antique lathes drill presses and other machines cut 
and shape the 3inchtall toy soldiers the machines were collected 
from other museums factories and machine shops throughout the 
state 
whitneys mass production system based on interchangeable 
parts the use of machine tools and the division of labor made 
possible levels of precision and productivity unheard of in his 
day 
whitneys work paved the way for connecticuts rise as a hub of 
precision manufacturing a legacy most children know little about 
brown said 
the experience of producing something collectively has become 
as foreign to these children as ballet or opera brown said in 
the last 20 or 30 years weve moved away from teaching anything 
about manufacturing thats a horrible mistake 
whitneys muskets were followed by colts revolvers the 
legendary gun that won the west and locks clocks 
typewriters and sewing machines today jet engines nuclear 
submarines and helicopters are made in connecticut along with colt 
guns 
but manufacturing has tapered off since 1943 when 507000 
workers in the state 63 percent of the connecticut work force 
were employed now only 22 percent of the work force or 350000 
out of 16 million jobs are in manufacturing 
over the next nine months the museum hopes to send as many as 
25000 students and other visitors home with toy soldiers and 
even more importantly with a better understanding and new 
appreciation of manufacturing 
peter moanfeldt a professor of mechanical engineering at 
greater new haven state technical college said the project 
addresses what he sees as a fundamental problem that threatens the 
health of the us economy 
we need people who are willing to go into plants and do 
work he said and were not turning out people who have that 
mind set were turning out people who want to sit in glassedin 
offices and run the plants 
we cant become a nation of bosses moanfeldt said

midshipmen come at a time when the maledominated institution is 
trying to rid the campus of sexual harassment 
academy students melvyn malcolm davis and gordon scott wilson

to abuse by male officers and male students 
in may the academy toughened its rules increasing the penalty 
for midshipman found guilty of physical abuse of a plebe to 
expulsion previously midshipmen were expelled for the more 
narrowly defined offense of hazing 
a navy survey found 46 percent of female midshipmen and 31 
percent of male midshipmen thought the 4500student academy had a 
problem with sexual harassment 
dreyer quit the academy in april to protest the punishment meted 
out to two male midshipmen they were penalized with loss of leave 
time and demerits and six others were issued written reprimands

residents of a public housing project here are 
the first residents of federally subsidized housing units in the 
nation to purchase their complex 
the kenilworthparkside development in the citys northeast 
quadrant was transferred to the residents on friday for 1 the 
transaction capped a fiveyear process in which the residents 
successfully managed the complex and qualified to purchase the 
property under a program boosted by housing secretary jack kemp 
the residents have worked so hard over the past five years to 
make this possible this can open the door for residents of other 
public housing complexes across the country whod like to have a 
definite say about their living conditions said kimi gray head 
of the kenilworthparkside resident management corp 
the first phase of the changeover included the transfer of 132 
housing units to the management corporation the remaining 332 
units are to be exchanged as renovations are completed 
a study by an independent accounting firm showed the program 
would save the government 6 million over 10 years and 26 million 
over 40 years 
the sale was made possible in part by amendments to the 1987 
housing act which gave resident councils the right to manage their 
own developments

the government has indicated it may 
have to raise taxes because of the persian gulf crisis and it 
unveiled a 164 billion borrowing plan to help finance the growing 
costs of german unity 
finance minister theo waigel also presented a new 128 billion 
supplementary budget friday most was earmarked for helping east 
germany 
chancellor helmut kohl has doggedly rejected opposition claims 
that he will eventually have to raise taxes to finance unification 
scheduled for wednesday but government officials have been hinting 
taxes may go up 
waigel told reporters through strict spending discipline we 
will do everything to avoid raising taxes 
asked how germany will pay for its contributions to help ease 
the gulf crisis he replied that the exclusion of a possible 
tax increase is limited to german unity 
kohl has pledged 21 billion to help the antiiraqi effort the 
sum includes equipment for us forces deployed in saudi arabia and 
assistance for nations like jordan that are suffering from a loss 
of trade 
raising taxes for gulf assistance would let kohl technically 
keep his word that germans wont face a tax increase because of 
unity 
kohls political rivals have charged the chancellor is trying to 
hide the true costs of unification so voters wont turn against him 
in allgerman elections 
the vote had been set for dec 2 but west germanys 
constitutional court ruled today that the plan is illegal because 
it keeps smaller parties off the ballot that could force 
postponement of the balloting unless political leaders agree on a 
new procedure 
waigel called the news conference friday to unveil the 
supplementary budget which would raise total outlays for this year 
to 252 billion 
the extra borrowing that he announced increases 1990 total to 
about 42 billion 
the added borrowing would cover new outlays earmarked for 
helping rebuild what is now east germany after unification 
higherthanexpected unity costs have already forced kohls 
government to adopt two previous supplementary budgets 
the latest budget addition includes extra money for the creation 
of new jobs in east germany which is suffering from heavy 
unemployment as antiquated businesses collapse in the new 
freemarket system it also provides more funds for housing 
jobless benefits pensions and health insurance

sidestepping soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev the russian republic has asked israel to form direct 
economic ties russian and israeli legislators say 
the israelis said friday they would consider the request but 
dont want to jeopardize the big prize eventual renewal of ties 
with the soviet union 
gorbachev is seeking better relations with israel and more 
investment in the troubled soviet economy but he would probably be 
angered by a special deal between jerusalem and the russian 
republic led by his chief rival boris yeltsin 
we will act carefully and i emphasize that said eliyahu 
benelissar chairman of the defense and foreign affairs committee 
in israels parliament 
we cant endanger all that is going on between us and the 
central authorities of the soviet union he told israel radio 
he was referring to the warming of ties between the two 
countries in the past three years there are growing indications 
that diplomatic relations could be restored in the near future 
the offer of direct ties with the russian republic came from 
vladimir lukin chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the 
republics parliament in a message to his israeli counterpart 
benelissar lukin said he was interestd in forming close working 
relations between the two committees the israeli legislator said 
but lukin suggested in an interview with israel radio broadcast 
friday that the real objective would be economic cooperation 
the idea of exchanging delegations between the foreign affairs 
committees of the two parliaments is in the works but the most 
important area is economics lukin said 
russia the soviet unions wealthiest largest and most populous 
republic has adopted a radical economic reform plan it is 
scheduled to go into effect oct 1 
the central soviet government meanwhile is working out details 
of a somewhat more conservative plan for leading to nation toward a 
freemarket system 
the russian republic has something to offer to israel and we 
are interested in your technologies lukin told the radio 
speaking in russian 
based on our radical economic program all are invited to 
trade to establish joint factories but many israelis would have a 
competitive edge because they know russia and its language he 
said 
lukin assured the israelis that they wouldnt harm their chances 
with gorbachev by developing ties with the russian republic which 
has been seeking greater independence from the central government 
benelissar said several months ago he asked the foreign affairs 
committee of the supreme soviet the soviet unions parliament to 
establish working ties but that he didnt receive an answer 
the soviet union cut diplomatic relations with israel after the 
jewish state conquered territory of moscows arab allies during the 
1967 middle east war

china is still holding hundreds of prisoners 
detained during last years crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement a usbased human rights group says 
the group asia watch on friday issued the most comprehensive 
list to date of prisoners of conscience held in chinese jails 
most of the 1000 prisoners profiled in the report were arrested 
after the military crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators on june 
4 1989 
sidney jones executive director of the new yorkbased 
organization said the aim of the report was to keep the prisoners 
from being forgotten 
we are concerned that human rights in china as an issue is 
going to fade from public view we want to make sure that these 
names become very much in the public eye she said in a telephone 
interview 
asia watch also hopes the report will help gain the release of 
those listed she said 
the group planned to try to give a copy to chinese foreign 
minister qian qichen when he attends the united nations general 
assembly in new york 
the chinese government did not immediately respond to the 
report it generally rejects criticism of its rights record as 
interference in its internal affairs 
thousands of chinese nationwide were detained or arrested 
immediately after last years studentled democracy movement was 
put down 
the asia watch report lists the names and backgrounds of those 
whose cases are known it also enumerates other arrests and 
executions reported by the official chinese media without giving 
names 
only 226 of the 1000 prisoners in the report have been tried 
sixtyseven were sentenced to death or executed 
called repression in china since june 4 1989 the report is 
far more comprehensive than those issued previously by asia watch 
and other international rights groups 
it includes people from every segment of society students 
intellectuals peasants workers and government officials from 
all 29 of chinas provinces and regions 
the focus has been on beijing when people think about the 
crackdown but its been widespread throughout china jones 
said 
the government has announced the release of 881 people in 
beijing and shanghai the past year but it has refused to say how 
many remain in jail nationwide for political offenses 
among those named in the report are such wellknown figures as 
liu xiaobo he is a literary critic who was on a fellowship at 
columbia university when the democracy movement began and he 
rushed back to china to take part 
the report mentions wang dan the bookish student who became one 
of the main protest leaders he has been held in solitary 
confinement in a maximumsecurity prison outside beijing 
the report also includes hundreds of other people who were 
caught up in the prodemocracy protests that spread to more than 80 
cities throughout china 
the report also includes dozens of tibetans and moslems 
imprisoned for separatist activities and christians arrested for 
conducting religious activities outside the staterun churches 
asia watch plans to present the report to congress next week 
during a hearing on a bill that would link future renewal of 
chinas mostfavorednation trade status to its rights record 
jones said 
president bush extended chinas preferential status for one year 
in june some legislators criticized his decision but it is not 
expected to be overturned

a 9foot ledge east germanys adn news agency said the inmate was 
slightly injured 
adn said inmates also occupied rooftops in buetzow and leipzig 
prisoners have been mounting periodic protests for weeks over the 
amnesty plan 
exempt from the prisoner amnesty plan are people convicted of 
murer war crimes sex offenses and other violent crimes 
the convicts want a broader amnesty program many claim they 
were falsely imprisoned under the former communist regime 
the amnesty plan passed by parliament was one of the 
legislatures last official acts before it formally disbands on 
tuesday one day before east germany is absorbed by west germany 
interior minister petermichael diestel spoke to the dresden 
inmates for several hours early this morning adn said 
in east berlin authorities arrested 15 people after hundreds of 
young people rampaged friday night through east berlins main

west germanys constitutional 
court ruled today that plans for united german elections in 
december are illegal because they keep smaller parties off the 
ballot 
the ruling does not affect the unification of east germany and 
west germany that comes on wednesday but it will force political 
leaders to seek a new election plan or perhaps postpone the united 
elections planned for dec 2 
west german justice minister hans engelhard said today his 
government will try to keep the dec 2 election date in place but 
also respect the decision of the constitutional court 
west german chancellor helmut kohl will be in charge of a united 
germany until the common elections are held 
the constitutional court acted on a complaint brought by east 
germanys former communist party the environmental greens 
coalition and the farright republicans 
hans christian stroebele spokesman for the greens hailed the 
courts decision he called it sweet success against the 
arrogance of the cocky dominant parties 
the smaller parties have opposed the election agreement between 
mainstream political groups because it required a party to win 5 
percent of the vote across a united germany in order to win a seat 
in parliament 
the election treaty would allow smaller parties to form 
alliances with larger parties and share ballot space with them 
allowing them to get the necessary 5 percent 
but the former communists and the rightist republicans have 
virtually no chance of finding mainstream parties that would share 
the ballot with them 
the courts decision was announced by ernst gottfried 
mahrenholz vice president of the constitutional court in 
karlsruhe near the french border 80 miles south of frankfurt 
he said the 5 percent clause in the election agreement would 
infringe on the rights of the parties that brought the complaint 
the court also struck down the mechanism that would allow 
smaller parties to be listed with larger allied parties 
the agreement rejected by the court represented a compromise 
between the kohls christian democrats which is the leading party 
in both germanys and the main opposition group the 
leftofcenter social democrats 
the social democrats wanted the 5 percent limit to keep smaller 
leftofcenter parties from getting in parliament and diluting the 
social democrats clout in a united germany 
the christian democrats wanted the agreement that would allow 
bigger parties to form alliances with smaller parties because 
kohls power base is comprised of coalitions with other 
conservative parties such as the powerful christian social union 
in germanys biggest state bavaria

the air force has decided to convert a 
mothballed 35 billion space shuttle dock into a backup pad for 
launches of the titan 4centaur rocket 
the pentagon said friday the multimillion dollar conversion of 
space launch complex6 at vandenberg air force base will start 
after oct 1 
the first launch of titan 4 rockets equipped with centaur 
upperstage boosters at the pad is expected in 1996 the pentagon 
said 
the air force believes the pad is needed in case an accident 
ever cripples vandenbergs space launch complex4 east which will 
be used early next year for the first west coast launch of a titan 
4 without a centaur upper stage col charles f sterling titan 4 
program director said in a statement 
sterling cited the 1985 explosion of a titan 34d rocket that 
temporarily halted use of another launch pad 
but a critic predicted the pad will never be used because 
congress will refuse to pay for the costly military communications 
and surveillance satellites meant to be launched on titan 
4centaurs 
theyve been working on this launch pad for more than two 
decades and it still hasnt launched anything space policy 
analyst john pike said friday by telephone from the federation of 
american scientists a public interest group in washington they 
just want to keep pouring concrete 
the conversion of slc6 will cost 300 million to 500 million 
and will be faster cheaper and environmently safer than building a 
new launch complex for up to 800 million said maj tom worsdale 
a vandenberg spokesman 
pike said he believed the conversion will cost far more he said 
the decision effectively forecloses ever flying the shuttle from 
california 
the cost of titan 4 and titan 4centaurs ranges from 173 
million to 265 million each according to various air force and 
general accounting office estimates

off funds because of allegations that the scouts oath 
discriminated against atheists

hendricks cast the only dissenting vote but denied that the 
cutoff of funds had originally been her idea

agencies nationwide to take such action the national association

the berlin wall guard post at checkpoint 
charlie was handed over to a german museum today for future 
exhibition to the public and it was lauded as a symbol of the 
american support for a free life 
in the course of its 29year existence checkpoint charlie 
witnessed acts of courage and acts of desperation said maj gen 
raymond e haddock the commander of us forces in west berlin 
the post which stood between the american and soviet sectors of 
berlin provided constant visible proof of allied determination 
to maintain their freedom of movement in all of berlin and to 
defend the freedom of berlin haddock said 
decorated with american british and french flags the small 
onestory building was given to the german historical museum at a 
ceremony attended by allied military chiefs diplomats and notables 
from berlin 
the guard post had stood at the friedrich street crossing 
between west and east berlin since 1961 when east germany erected 
the berlin wall to keep its citizens from moving to the west last 
november after a popular revolution the wall was opened and in 
june the guard building actually the fourth in a series of 
temporary structures was lifted by a crane and put in storage 
checkpoint charlie stood as a symbol of the american support 
for a free life said anke martiny a member of the west berlin 
city council responsible for cultural affairs 
she also recalled the berlin airlift in which us and british 
planes kept berlin alive in 194849 when the soviet blockade tried 
to starve the outpost city in the middle of communist east germany 
without the help of the allies berlin would not have 
survived she said 
museum director christoph stoelzl said the building would be 
stored while a place is found to display it safely stoelzl said 
the same souvenirhunters who are hammering constantly on the 
remains of the berlin wall would probably attack checkpoint 
charlie too 
they want to take it away in pieces he said 
the mundane function of the checkpoint was to serve as a place 
to register american british and french military people traveling 
into the soviet sector it was usually manned by two american 
military police and one french and one british mp though in 1961 
after the wall went up us and soviet tanks faced each other 
across the checkpoint in a tense dispute over the right of allied 
soldiers to travel unhindered in the eastern sector 
ive seen it all here said us army staff sgt nathaniel 
brown 39 a veteran of three years with the checkpoint charlie 
unit

police station overnight seizing arms and ammunition the yugoslav 
news agency tanjug reported today

speech but i will go there and my lawyer will present my 
objections

appear before another tribunal in the eastern city of lahore on

disqualified as a candidate in the oct 24 elections and barred 
from politics for seven years

dismissed ms bhuttos government on aug 6 and installed a 
caretaker government comprised largely of her opponents

incompetence and abuse of power 
ms bhutto has denied any wrongdoing and accused the president 
and the caretaker government of launching a witch hunt against her

bhutto of illegally using an asia development bank loan to hire a 
foreign consulting firm to oversee a karachi power project and of 
allowing a britishbased firm to export cotton at rates far below 
the international market rate 
the caretaker government has tried to portray ms bhuttos 
administration as the most corrupt in pakistans 43year history

generated a wave of sympathy for ms bhutto analysts say she and 
her party appear to be gaining strength and could emerge from next 
months election as the single largest party

vietnams foreign minister today promised 
that his country would withdraw all its military advisers from 
cambodia but he provided no timetable for the withdrawal 
the pledge by foreign minister nguyen co thach came before his 
meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii for the 
highestlevel talks between the two countries since the vietnam 
war 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in 1978 has withdrawn all or 
most of its 140000 troops from cambodia western intelligence 
officials believe it was not immediately known how many military 
advisers remain in cambodia 
we have withdrawn our forces and we will withdraw all our 
advisers the foreign minister said adding that vietnam had 
agreed to international monitoring in cambodia 
the private meeting with baker followed a series of sessions 
this summer between vietnams un ambassador and state department 
officials vietnam has been seeking to forge diplomatic ties with 
the united states 
baker said that the two countries would have to resolve such 
issues as american prisoners of war and those missing in action 
during the vietnam war 
the minister knows that the pace and the scope of our ability 
to move toward normalization with vietnam is going to depend on 
further progress on the powmia issue baker told reporters 
president bushs administration has been expanding diplomatic 
contacts with both hanoi and the vietnameseinstalled government in 
cambodia the united states had supported the rebel resistance but 
officials in washington are now worried that a communist rebel 
faction that once ruled cambodia will force its way back to power 
vietnam installed the cambodian government when it invaded that 
country in 1978 to oust the communist faction the khmer rouge 
during its rule from 197579 the khmer rouge killed hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians directly through purges and executions and 
indirectly through starvation and the hardship of a radical 
agrarian relocation program 
washington has said improved diplomatic ties with vietnam depend 
on vietnams cooperation with a un peace plan for cambodia 
under that plan the united nations would administer most of 
cambodias government until new elections are held 
the plan was worked out by the five permanent un security 
council members the united states britain france china and the 
soviet union 
if carried out it would be an unprecedented un operation to 
settle a regional conflict costing up to 5 billion over one or 
two years it would involve up to 10000 peacekeeping troops and 
10000 civilian personnel 
on friday president bushs administration signed agreements 
providing 2 million to meet health needs of cambodian children it 
is the first us government aid earmarked for that country in 15 
years 
the aid will be administered by world vision relief and 
development and unicef the un agency to help children

republican david dukes past as a 
crossburning ku klux klansman is under attack as democratic sen 
j bennett johnston tries to deal him a knockout blow in 
louisianas open primary 
johnston who is seeking a fourth term in washington is out to 
capture 50 percent of the vote in the oct 6 primary to avoid a 
november runoff against duke the senator has gone on the offensive 
against duke after earlier seeking to stress his own experience and 
influence in congress 
one of johnstons latest tv spots features old footage of duke 
saluting a burning klan cross and quotes him as saying there is 
no more truly representative symbol of the white race than the 
fiery cross 
the narrator then warns david duke is lying about his past 
dont trust him with our future 
another ad financed by an independent antiduke group features 
a jeopardytype game show that asks what politician hired 
exnazis to work on his campaign failed to file state income taxes 
for four years and lied about serving in the military contestants 
correctly answer who was david duke in each case 
the ad closes with the caption who is david duke 
duke who was elected to the state house in 1989 and remains the 
head of the national association for the advancement of white 
people insists too much is made of his past 
he said he plans to go on television this week with a 30minute 
fireside chat explaining his stand on the issues duke says he is 
opposed to affirmative action plans for minorities and favors 
civil rights for everybody 
every elected official is going to find out there is a 
majority out there in favor of equal rights not affirmative 
action and against further tax increases he says 
the presence of a third major senate candidate state sen ben 
bagert of new orleans increases the possibility of a runoff 
between johnston and duke although bagert has the official 
blessing of the republican party his campaign has been hampered by 
a lack of money and support 
a recent poll by the university of new orleans showed johnston 
with 46 percent of the vote duke with 21 percent and bagert with 8 
percent twenty percent were undecided and 5 percent would not 
reveal who they planned to vote for 
under louisianas open primary system all candidates 
regardless of party run on the same ballot if no candidate wins a 
majority the top two finishers meet in a runoff 
based on heavy absentee voting which ended at noon saturday 
the secretary of states office predicted that up to 70 percent of 
the states registered voters would cast ballots 
johnston said duke cant win the state but can damage 
louisianas reputation if he forces his way into a november runoff 
wayne parent a political science professor at louisiana state 
university said a runoff involving duke could be devastating to 
republicans in other races across the nation 
republicans have been haunted by the perception that they are 
antiblack parent said given david dukes history his 
candidacy is reinforcing the concept of republicanism and racism 
although the national republican party has repudiated duke 
parent said a runoff would give duke the opportunity to be the 
republican senate candidate for a month 
national republican officials have echoed parents view saying 
they do not want duke to make a runoff sen ted stevens ralaska 
campaigned recently with johnston and said bagert should drop out 
of the race 
until early 1989 the ku klux klans telephone number and that 
of duke were the same duke also has been criticized for selling 
neonazi literature out of his office and has admitted he wrote a 
book showing blacks how to attack whitey 
research into dukes past last week brought to light a 1987 
letter in which he advocated separating blood banks by race to 
fight the spread of aids 
duke responded that he now would favor segregating the blood 
supply only if aids presented a greater threat to one race or 
social group he said he is no longer sure that aids is more 
prevalent among blacks than whites 
duke a former imperial wizard of the klan first attracted 
attention in the early 1970s when he showed up at louisiana state 
universitys free speech alley in a nazi uniform 
johnston said that if duke is elected louisiana faces the loss 
of federal projects and military installations duke has accused 
johnston of using scare tactics and says he would be effective 
in washington because of a changing national political climate

editors note this report is one of a series on the german 
countdown to unity on oct 3 
 
east berlin ap east germanys children will grow up in a 
nation that is vastly different from the one in which their parents 
lived 
the associated press asked german literature teacher ingeborg 
knirsch to assign an essay to students at grammar school no 18 in 
east berlin 
forty students were asked to describe how they felt about the 
end of east germany and their future in the new land 
here are some representative responses 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i think its truly good that german unification is coming you 
could hardly travel freely and give your opinion in other years 
there is naturally also a negative side for example 
unemployment losing your home in any case i see germany as my 
fatherland but i think the hatred of foreigners and the drugs are 
totally bad there already is hatred of foreigners in the gdr east 
germany but i am totally for a united germany 
i have truly given no thought about my own future but i have no 
fear because i hope to become a catechism teacher which is 
something i could not be before 
up until the fifth grade i thought the gdr was super but after 
i thought about it and talked about it with my parents i realized 
it was a bad government i found it to be sinister and terrible 
true i was content because we had food and other things but 
thats not my opinion now i hate the stasi secret police and the 
police the teachers used to ask us for our opinions but if we 
gave our opinions they said that was wrong 
and former communist leader erich honecker gave orders to 
shoot people who crossed the border all this was done for the 
people 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i think its right for a united germany to be created but not 
so fast and not in this fashion the coming unity is bringing many 
problems for us 
my mother lost her job and my father is on shorter hours 
because of that there are a lot of problems in our family my 
mother is afraidbecause the jobless pay is so small and she has to 
go to the unemployment office every day to see if there are jobs 
we had a lot of things that were good such as social things 
free kindergarten work holidays cheap rent and subsidies for 
food 
my future is very uncertain i hope to learn languages and later 
become an interpreter perhaps i can also work with computers 
we should have reformed the older government but now it is too 
late we brought about a lot with the demonstrations last year 
but the end of the gdr should not have looked like this unity came 
too fast 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
there are many problems in my family my parents were both 
members of the communist party and are now in the reformed 
communist party this party is not particularly beloved but it 
has many supporters 
i dont believe everything was so bad before the revolution 
some things were bad the stasi for example but every country has 
a secret service 
my dream is to be a reporter in boston and to meet the group new 
kids on the block but i am afraid that is only a dream 
i think it was right the wall was built in 1961 but it should 
have let more people through the borders shouldnt have been made 
absolutely tight 
i believe for many people from a moral standpoint it was good 
that the border was opened on nov 9 1989 because my grandma had 
not seen her brother for 28 years 
the end of the gdr is as if my apartment burned down it was the 
homeland 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i dont want any unity because i always read in the paper and 
see on television and hear on the radio that there is so much 
joblessness and so much fear 
the rents rise how can you pay your rent if you dont have a 
job 
i think its terrible that the cdu christian democratic union 
the governing party in both germanys is getting rid of all the 
foreigners here they have been here for years and now what 
i am afraid that i wont find a job i want to be a zookeeper 
i find it idiotic that the stores here wont sell east products 
anymore now that the wall fell i dont really feel secure now 
there is robbery and murder 
i also find it idiotic that you have to pay for a doctor visit 
what happens if you are sick and dont have a job 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the unity of german brings for our fatherland great changes 
many positive things have come to us for example a new range of 
goods but also it raises new questions for example unemployment 
the gdr was a highly developed socialist country with many 
industries certainly i cant write about all of that because i am 
still small 
i am only 12 years old and have still not made a plan for the 
future 
now the gdr will soon end and we will join together with the frg 
west germany in case of a war which we would never hope for 
that is a good thing because karl marx indeed said unity makes 
strength 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
before unification on oct 3 i have a lot of fear because i 
dont know how bad it will be and whether well see riots on our 
streets 
of course there are things that please me too we can buy 
pretty things and sweets but we must not think about our futures 
but the jobs of our parents and about the rent 
my parents cannot afford to pay 1000 marks per month in our 
building where the elevator doesnt work and there is no warm 
water i dont think its right that whatever is in the west 
germany must be given to us 
for bread we paid 90 pfennigs and now we pay three marks 
im worried about my future i cant believe that everything our 
parents produced was bad 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the coming unity is good because we will live as one country 
instead of two 
i hope my parents have money to keep sending me to school i 
dont know anymore which profession to choose jobs that i 
sometimes wanted arent any good anymore 
the gdr had many good sides and not only bad ones as everyone 
always says the old government made a lot of mistakes 
im not so happy about the end of the gdr because it was my 
home we had no contact with crime and drugs and now were 
confronted directly by it

fewer than 20 percent of eligible voters cast 
ballots in the 1990 primaries according to a nonpartisan study 
released on saturday 
dismal as it might appear that turnout was about average for a 
midterm election reported the committee for the study of the 
american electorate the report also cautioned that turnout in 
primaries is not an indicator of whether voters will be motivated 
to go to the polls in november 
the turnout for states which had primaries in both parties was 
1956 percent down a fraction of a percent from 1986 
there were a few bright spots hot contests for the republican 
and democratic nominations for governor of massachusetts brought 
out 32 percent of the voters the highest turnout for such 
elections there since 1962 
in the district of columbia nearly 27 percent of the eligible 
democrats turned out to choose nominees for mayor the highest 
participation since the city gained home rule in 1974 
in both massachusetts and the district of columbia the surge of 
primary election voters resulted in a rejection of political 
insiders 
john silber won the democratic nomination for governor of 
massachusetts easily defeating the preelection favorite former 
attorney general frank bellotti also campaigning as an outsider 
william weld captured the gop nomination for governor defeating 
legislative republican leader steven pierce 
sharon pratt dixon who has never held elective office defeated 
four officeholders to win the democratic nomination for mayor of 
washington 
even in this era of cynicism public disillusionment with 
politics and declining voter participation the public will vote if 
they have something important to vote for or against said curtis 
b gans director of the committee 
but gans said it was too early to tell whether the 
antiincumbent mood that was reflected in some of the primaries 
will turn activist in november and whether it will affect all 
incumbents or as is more traditional the party which occupies the 
white house 
he also noted primary election turnout has not necessarily 
been a reliable indicator of general election trends 
the states with the highest percentage turnout in the primaries 
were alaska with 379 percent wyoming 363 arkansas 325 
massachusetts 324 montana 32 oklahoma 313 and nebraska 302 
lowest turnout was in connecticut with 52 percent new jersey 
55 south carolina 74 wisconsin 90 maine 113 and michigan

ingeborg knirsch thumbed through the thick 
stack of essays and shook her head so many pages of childhood 
scrawl were laced with fear and anxiety 
these were words written by east german children about the end 
of their nation and the birth of a new one this was the voice of 
the next generation 
i was astounded astounded said mrs knirsch a teacher 
in east berlin im more optimistic about our future than these 
children seem to be 
what these essays reflected were households in turmoil a nation 
in transition a society on the edge of enormous change 
no one has a greater stake in the fate of the new german nation 
than the children of east germany the shifting winds of history 
have profoundly altered their future 
they will be the first generation of east germans to come of age 
in a free land but one that faces tremendous social upheaval as it 
leaves the old ways behind 
the associated press visited grammar school no 18 and asked 
mrs knirsch to assign some of her german literature students an 
essay about wednesdays unification of germany 
she chose an eighthgrade class and a sixthgrade class and told 
them to write 100200 words 
but each class produced torrents of words an outpouring that 
mixed hope for the distant future with a startling bleakness about 
the coming months 
i told them short short short and they said no i must 
write mrs knirsch said five hundred 600 words one of them 
wrote 800 words in 45 minutes 
she said she was stunned by the content 
they were worried about keeping their homes about their 
parents keeping their jobs about their rents rising she said 
much she said was a reflection of the worries expressed by 
anxious parents the grim accounts of furrowedbrow newscasters 
everything is getting more expensive rents telephone 
service and so forth and many people are jobless wrote diana 
schulz 12 my parents also are already jobless 
the rent is higher and my parents lost their jobs wrote 
lohin lueben 12 the only good thing about oct 3 is that its a 
school holiday 
there was support for german unity but paradoxically regret 
the gdr german democratic republic would end 
these children like all others were drilled to be loyal to 
their nation and communism and suspicious of the crimeridden 
greedy west 
the gdr was my fatherland and now the gdr really wont be any 
more it is incomprehensible wrote 12yearold anke schramm 
you can kick a soccer ball from the playground of grammar school 
no 18 to where the berlin wall once loomed checkpoint charlie 
the former allied border crossing stood half a block away 
much of the neighborhood part of east berlins increasingly 
seedy leipziger street has become a lure for derelicts and 
criminals 
on tuesday about 200 leftist radicals from west berlin wearing 
black ski masks and wielding pipes destroyed the front of a 
grocery store nearby 
mrs knirsch said many children watched the scene from their 
apartment buildings 
many essays contained worried references to crime 
now that the wall fell i dont really feel secure wrote

the soviet empire crumbles germany unites iraq 
invades america intervenes japan though mainly talks and 
talks 
before the persian gulf crisis began serious questions were 
raised about whether this pacific power would soon replace the 
united states as the leading global force 
to some it seemed only a question of time it will take more 
than time japan analysts now say its not likely to happen at 
all many agree because in an era when many commentators are 
declaring the start of a new world order the worlds no 2 
economic power lacks the vision to be anything more 
japan whose postwar rise was helped by avoiding the military 
costs shouldered by the united states and soviet union may see 
little reason to grasp a greater political or military role 
worldwide 
no other country can replace the united states as the leader 
of the world said seizaburo sato a tokyo university political 
scientist and adviser to two former prime ministers 
the world has become unipolar in a sense the us is the 
only remaining superpower but the pole is not so high as it once 
was so we would like to support the pole and make it higher 
during the gulf crisis as in many times past japan has been 
nudged into action by the united states after 3 weeks of 
government haggling it promised 1 billion and medical aid to the 
multinational gulf force and arab nations affected by the un 
trade embargo on iraq washington criticized the offer as stingy 
japan returned with a promise of 3 billion more but the 
belated offer smacked of japans old habit of doing the minimum 
necessary to appease america 
japan does not have any idea what to do beyond joining in the 
economic sanctions the asahi shimbun newspaper editorialized 
today two months after iraqs seizure of kuwait there are 
about 200000 us british and french troops in the middle east 
japan has sent 17 medical personnel and a debate looms in 
parliament over prime minister toshiki kaifus proposal thursday 
made on the eve of a us visit to deploy a small number of 
unarmed troops overseas for the first time since world war ii 
some conservative politicans fearful of a loss of international 
prestige for japan are pushing for more a reinterpretation of the 
ban in japans postwar constitution on using force overseas 
they are quietly backed by commanders of the selfdefense 
forces japans military but the commanders have little say in a 
country still bitter over an independent military that broke free 
of civilian control in the 1930s leading to war 
japans political timidity predates the gulf crisis wielding 
economic might beyond her militarist dreams a halfcentury ago 
japan still dragged its feet in offering aid to newly liberalized 
eastern europe officials contended the region was too remote 
tokyo recently became the worlds no 1 source of foreign aid 
but only after years of pressure from the united states and other 
western nations tired of watching japan recycle profits back into 
its blockbuster economy 
most of the aid has been issued in loans not the typical 
grants and the program has been criticized as commercially 
selfserving and inefficient 
japan still doesnt have a concept of itself as a global 
actor said sheila smith a researcher at the japan institute of 
international affairs in tokyo japanese believe the world is 
not their problem 
us public opinion polls show americans overwhelmingly back 
president bushs policy of intervening in the gulf surveys here 
however indicate most japanese feel america is only defending its 
oil interests even though japan imports more of its oil 70 
percent from the middle east than any other industrialized 
nation 
in one recent poll 83 percent of japanese said they opposed 
sending military personnel to the gulf 
japans leaders are not being naive as historian paul kennedy 
argued in his bestselling book the rise and fall of the great 
powers major nations have declined by overexpanding straining 
their economies with military expenditures 
japan has avoided such a role 
japan has been able to enjoy all the advantages of evolving 
into a global economic giant but without any of the political 
responsibilities and territorial disadvantages which have 
historically followed from such a growth kennedy wrote 
little wonder that it prefers things to remain as they are 
japanese analysts argue that empirebuilding nations usually 
focused on pragmatic selfcentered policies only the united 
states they say has made its ostensible goal the exportation of 
democracy and freedom as universal principles 
japan recently made independent diplomatic forays into north 
korea and china as part of its strategy of creating a regional 
power base 
japans foreign policy has been summed up as do whatever is 
needed to maintain japans special relationship with the united 
states a code phrase signifying the usjapan security 
arrangement and japans huge export stake in the us economy 
its been a very successful foreign policy for 40 years 
said gerald curtis a japanese politics expert at columbia 
university in new york but its no longer sufficient

gen michel roquejeoffre the overall french commander and a 
paratrooper greeted col gilbert leguen commander of the

most of the legionnaires maintained a stony silence following 
orders as they marched singlefile along the quay 
their first stay will be in a warehouse larger than a football 
field to regroup for the trip across the desert 
their commanding officer said it has been a halfcentury since 
the legion gave refuge to any person off the street 
we take who we like not just anybody the days of anybody are 
over said renard a 10year veteran of the force

originally from although about half are french 
once you join the legion youre just a legionnaire said an 
officer who ordered all his men to speak french while reporters 
were around 
renard 47 said most of the men under his command had returned 
from more than four months in the sahara desert in chad last 
february and he expected conditions in saudi arabia to be the 
same 
i think it may be a little hotter here well find out the 
captain said 
renard said the legionnaires had not been briefed on how long 
they would stay in saudi arabia 
the legionnaires do what is asked of them a legionnaire is a 
soldier first he said

after 45 years the soviet union finally got 
invited to the premier celebration of capitalism the annual 
meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund 
but the soviet delegates spent the week sitting in a corner far 
away from the action playing the role of economic wallflowers 
they came to the ball but were not asked to dance 
instead they sat on the sidelines right next to mongolia 
the only difference is that mongolia has formally applied for 
membership in the imf and the world bank and its application is 
expected to receive speedy approval 
the soviet union uncertain of its chances for success has yet 
to apply for membership the soviet delegation however left no 
doubt that the country would like to join the institutions soviet 
leaders used to deride as bastions of capitalist economics 
the imf and world bank with their huge lending resources look 
a lot more inviting these days with soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev appealing for massive amounts of western aid for his 
faltering economy 
victor v geraschenko the head of the soviet delegation and the 
chairman of the countrys state bank the gosbank met wit various 
finance ministers and with top imf and world bank officials to 
present his countrys case 
he declined to be specific about when the soviets might submit a 
formal membership application although he said one could come next 
year 
but even with the desperate situation facing the soviet economy 
imf and world bank officials said they did not see any prospect for 
quick membership for the country 
the soviets are obviously interested in integrating their 
economy into the global economy but it will take some time for 
them to go through the process of membership application world 
bank president barber conable said at the close of last weeks 
meetings 
we do not anticipate an early membership by the soviet 
union conable said 
officials give a variety of reasons for hesistance in accepting 
the soviets as members in the two institutions these range from 
the difficulty in interpreting soviet economic statistics to the 
lack of convertibility for the soviet currency the ruble 
however the major stumbling block is political the united 
states the country with the largest voting power in both 
institutions is at present opposed to soviet membership 
the fear in the bush administration is that given the turmoil 
wracking the soviet economy massive amounts of western aid 
supplied now could well end up being wasted or perhaps even 
delaying needed movement toward a freemarket economy 
treasury undersecretary david mulford said the united states is 
awaiting the results of a study of the soviet economy before 
deciding whether to modify its current opposition to direct western 
aid 
that review which is being coordinated by the imf is scheduled 
to be completed in december top finance officials from the worlds 
seven richest industrial countries the united states japan west 
germany britain france canada and italy received a closeddoor 
briefing on the study last week 
one official who spoke on condition that he not be named said 
imf managing director michel camdessus stressed that the soviet 
union needed a strong central bank as a key step in getting control 
of its serious economic problems 
the debate over how much power to give the central government is 
currently being hotly debated in the soviet union with many leaders 
in the 15 soviet republics seeking ways to give the central 
government less not more power 
in the absence of imf and world bank membership the two 
agencies did make an offer to provide the soviets with technical 
assistance an approach that also is favored by the united states 
the soviets are interested in doing a lot of restructuring and 
doing it fairly quickly we are happy to advise them about that 
because that is our business said conable whose agency last 
year made 20 billion of development loans to third world 
countries 
camdessus said there was a precedent for the imf providing 
technical advice to nonmembers he said the agency was 
instrumental in helping namibia set up a central bank before it 
became a member this year and he said the same help would be 
available to the soviets 
with the speed of current events camdessus said it would be 
wrong to assume that just because the soviets did not now qualify 
for imfworld bank membership that situation would never change 
at last years meeting who could have imagined that we would 
be on the verge of seeing a unified germany camdessus said 
history is moving very rapidly to tell you where we will be in a 
year or two is very difficult

irans resumption of diplomatic relations 
with britain caps two months of nonstop political military and 
economic gains for tehran since its old foe iraq invaded kuwait 
for the past few weeks everything seems to have been going 
irans way amid the chaos touched off by the iraqi invasion in 
many ways iran has won more since kuwait was overrun aug 2 by 
iraqi forces than it did in the decade of upheaval and war that 
followed the 1979 islamic revolution 
the gulf crisis is far from being resolved but tehran courted 
by both sides is already looking like one of the winners from the 
confrontation between two of its old enemies iraq and the united 
states 
the irony is that tehran owes much of what it has gained to 
saddam hussein whose country it fought from 1980 to 1988 in a war 
that had no victor only victims and caused at least 1 million 
casualties 
saddams invasion gave iranian president hashemi rafsanjani a 
golden opportunity to accelerate his efforts to end the islamic 
republics isolation improve relations with the west and secure 
investment and advanced technology to rebuild the economy 
last week iran boasted it has taken delivery of advanced mig29 
interceptors for its badly depleted air force under a 6 billion 
economic and military agreement with moscow 
restoring relations with london will likely speed up 
rafsanjanis efforts to normalize links with western europe and 
could herald the release of british hostages held in lebanon 
four britons are among the 13 westerners missing in lebanon 
most are believed held by proiranian shiite moslem militants 
the tehran times which often reflects rafsanjanis thinking 
noted saturday the complete normalization of iranian relations 
with the european community can lead to extensive cooperation in 
many areas particularly the persian gulf crisis 
tehran severed relations with britain on march 7 1989 over 
salman rushdies novel the satanic verses which irans late 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini deemed had 
blasphemed islam he issued a fatwa or religious ruling 
condemning rushdie to death 
britain rejected iranian demands to ban the book and denounce 
rushdie iran refused to lift the death sentence even after 
khomeini died in june 1989 
the 12 ec nations withdrew their ambassadors from tehran in 
solidarity with britain after khomeinis death decree most later 
sent envoys back but have withheld full normalization until 
relations with britain were restored 
thursdays announcement that relations are being restored did 
not spell out the agreement beyond saying it was based on mutual 
respect 
but british foreign secretary douglas hurd stressed that iranian 
leaders had indicated there would be no interference in the 
internal affairs of any other country 
that was interpreted to mean iran would quietly drop the death 
sentence on rushdie without publicly revoking it 
there have even been slight movements in irans stormy 
relationship with the united states on sept 21 the united states 
paid a 200 million claim to iran for undelivered american 
equipment orders dating from before the 1979 islamic revolution it 
was the largest claim before a tribunal settling billions in 
iranian assets frozen by the united states 
in the last few days iran has also restored relations with 
tunisia severed in 1987 amid allegations tehran was backing moslem 
fundamentalists seeking to topple the government there are signs 
too of a thaw in the feud with saudi arabia 
some analysts and diplomats are talking about including iran in 
a new regional defense alliance with egypt turkey syria and saudi 
arabia 
whether that ever emerges arab strategists even talking about 
including iran underlines now how rafsanjani has led his country 
toward international acceptance after years as a pariah and how the 
gulf crisis has redrawn the political map of the middle east 
the islamic republic has emerged more powerful than ever it 
has won everything for which it fought an asian diplomat in 
tehran said in a telephone interview 
saddam finding himself in a tight corner after the invasion 
abruptly gave into iranian demands aug 15 after two years of 
deadlocked peace negotiations on formally ending the war 
he withdrew his army from iranian territory seized in the 
conflict began a prisonerofwar exchange and agreed to share 
sovereignty over the shattalarab waterway the strategically 
important southern border between iran and iraq 
baghdads improved relations with tehran have allowed iraq to 
shift forces toward kuwait iraq also has tried to persuade iran to 
break a un security council embargo but iran has pledged to 
abide by the sanctions 
for the iranians saddams cavein meant they had won the gulf 
war in a moral sense if not militarily 
they felt it vindicated their claim that iraq was the aggressor 
and their warnings that saddam would one day turn on his erstwhile 
allies like kuwait and saudi arabia 
irans leaders are now waiting for a possible visit to tehran by 
saddam himself an event that for them would be the final act of 
iraqi submission

the gathering of nations to the brink of war in 
the middle east is a sign some evangelical leaders believe may 
herald the most feared and soughtafter age in christianity 
armageddon and the second coming 
at least one fundamentalist television evangelist believes god 
may call all bornagain christians up to heaven at any day that 
would usher in a sevenyear period of destruction that only a third 
of the worlds population would survive before christ comes to rule 
over a world in which the lion will lay down with the lamb and 
swords will be beaten into plowshares 
saddam hussein is just kind of an activator bringing it all 
together said the rev charles taylor host of the syndicated 
television show today in bible prophecy its time to rejoice 
for the christians were going home 
what has caused the current revival in speculation of the end 
time is the resurgence of babylon in the form of modernday iraq 
the ruins of the ancient city lie 60 miles south of presentday 
baghdad 
several of the bibles prophetic books including isaiah 
revelation and ezekiel refer to the rise and fall of babylon some 
believe babylons rise today may be the precursor of the final 
battle between the lord and the enemies of israel and the coming 
of the savior to rule over the world 
few evangelicals are ready to don white robes and implore people 
on street corners to repent the end is near but some are 
saying iraqs invasion of kuwait and menacing stance toward israel 
point toward the the final conflict between good and evil 
i would not predict we are near the end of the age although i 
personally think we are evangelist billy graham said 
religious movements built around predictions of christs second 
coming have long been a part of us religious history 
in the 19th century the rev william miller caused thousands of 
americans to prepare for the lords coming even after his 
predicted dates in the 1840s passed by uneventfully his work laid 
the foundation for the seventhday adventist movement later in the 
century jehovahs witnesses grew into a national movement amid 
similar predictions 
more recently some thought former president reagans foreign 
policy particularly his hawkish view of soviet union may have 
been based on a belief in biblical warnings of armageddon being 
started by invaders from the north 
saddam has done little to discourage speculation he may trigger 
the final conflict seeking to exploit his nations past glories 
the iraqi leader has spent millions to rebuild babylon he also has 
portrayed himself as the new nebuchadnezzar the babylonian 
warriorking who sacked jerusalem in the 6th century bc 
in seeking greater arab support for his invasion of kuwait 
saddam also has spoken in increasingly ominous terms about israel 
history has gone full circle and we are coming back to these 
lands graham said during a recent crusade this is not another 
korea it is not another vietnam it is something far more 
sinister and far more difficult 
the circumstances are such that we see the culmination of 
gods plan for planet earth said the rev paul schenck of new 
covenant tabernacle a large assemblies of god church in suburban 
buffalo ny 
he added that he has mixed feelings about the possibility i 
will not be disappointed if my children grow up and i see my 
greatgrandchildren 
most mainline biblical scholars give little credence to such 
speculation they say such analysis takes out of context biblical 
passages that were written in a specific culture and time for 
different teaching purposes 
rabbi james rudin of the american jewish committee puts it 
bluntly i would not give saddam hussein any place in a 
theological end time 
such criticism does not bother a fundamentalist such as taylor 
who interprets the bible literally and believes the bodily ascent 
of christians into heaven before armageddon can happen at any time 
wars usually happen in the middle east in the october period 
before the snows come and after the hot weather taylor said 
the lord would really have to put it on hold the way things are 
going 
thers are less certain that the decisive battle between the 
forces of good and evil is at hand 
even some of the most intense prophecy preachers are reluctant 
to say this is it said the rev richard buhler host of a 
national radio show for evangelicals called table talk 
some factors work against the theories linking saddam and 
armageddon 
for one thing skeptics can cite references to babylons being a 
great power holding the riches of the world at the time of its 
destruction the rev chuck smith a radio evangelist based in 
costa mesa calif says the iraqis could fit that description 
within two years if they gain control of enough oil 
god is focusing the attention of the world on the middle east 
to alert us to the fact time is running out said smith whose 
program the word for today is heard on 150 radio stations 
meantime what does one do 
taylor is urging his listeners to make a final effort to convert 
friends and relatives to bornagain christianity while others say 
christians should look beyond the initial period of suffering to 
promises of another paradise beyond armageddon 
rather than forebodings of doom these things to us are just 
the prelude to a glorious new day said smith personally i 
believe the lord will create heaven on earth

three years ago george bush complained that the 
united nations was another light that failed largely 
ineffective and sometimes counterproductive on monday he will 
stand before the general assembly and praise the uns resolve in 
opposing iraqs aggression 
there has been a remarkable turnabout in the white house 
attitude toward the un which not so long ago was viewed as a 
platform for antiamericanism and third world dissent 
now administration leaders do not hide their delight over the 
tough stands taken by the un against iraq spanning eight 
security council resolutions condemning its invasion of kuwait and 
imposing bans on trade and financial dealings 
its unbelievable said john bolton assistant secretary of 
state for international relations its like being in san 
francisco in 1945 when the un was founded amid an air of 
idealism 
we are reading articles of the un charter that have not been 
seriously read in 45 years bolton said a lot of what were 
doing were doing quite literally for the first time in the 
history of the united nations 
says bush were now in sight of a united nations that 
performs as envisioned by its founders the united nations is 
backing up its words with action 
the dramatic change is due in large measure to the warming of 
relations between the united states and soviet union the 
superpowers throughout the cold war had used the un as a 
primary forum for ideological battles now they stand more as 
allies than adversaries 
when the us and the soviets decide the un will be a 
serious place its a serious place said judith kipper a middle 
east expert at the brookings institution a washington think tank 
there are other explanations as well for the uns unity in 
the persian gulf crisis there are third world nations worried by 
the specter of a larger nation gobbling up a helpless neighbor 
there are countries concerned about oil prices and supplies there 
are countries jockeying for position in the arab world 
everyone is acting according to their selfinterests said 
alan keyes former assistant secretary of state for international 
relations it didnt require much persuasion to achieve a un 
consensus 
charles lichenstein who was alternate us representative at 
the un in the early 1980s said the security council resolutions 
were a useful way of rallying nations that traditionally feel 
obliged to be antiamerican 
it provides a number of countries with a marvelous excuse for 
being on the side of the united states when they might not have 
leapt to their feet otherwise he said 
bolton said that when iraq invaded kuwait it was kind of an 
automatic decision to turn to the un for one thing bush had 
been us ambassador to the world body from 1971 to 1973 and had a 
feel for the organization 
perhaps more importantly there was a belief that the un over 
the past three to four years had started to act effectively in 
matters of international peace and security such as the iraniraq 
war the transition of namibia to independent status and un 
oversight of nicaraguan elections 
bush signaled a new attitude toward the un when he picked a 
highly respected career diplomat thomas pickering as un 
ambassador a skilled trouble shooter pickering had served as 
ambassador both in israel and in jordan 
the fact that he selected pickering shows very strongly that 
he bush has a commitment to the institution said james 
spiegelman director of research for georgetown universitys center 
for international business and trade you cant underestimate the 
importance of having a guy like pickering in there as bushs top 
man maneuvering votes and doing his bidding 
administration officials say bush has taken an active role with 
secretary of state james a baker iii in advising pickering 
he knows the strengths and weaknesses of the un better than 
the head of government anywhere in the world said bolton he 
just has a very good sense of the institution 
with a penchant for personal diplomacy bush also has used the 
telephone frequently to sustain the consensus against iraq between 
aug 2 and sept 7 bush talked with foreign leaders on 71 
occasions about the gulf officials said 
yet some question whether bushs un experience has been 
instrumental in dealing with the world body 
the fact is it takes you about five minutes to learn what 
string to pull said lichenstein he was there for 
substantially less than two years you dont learn very much in two 
years 
keyes said that with reduced soviet tensions and arab 
nervousness about iraq its not very hard for us to put together 
the coalition at the un

the hills know nothing of saddam hussein 
they hear no talk of recession the vibrant reds oranges and 
yellows emblazon the countryside in a burst of glory before the 
long white silence that lies ahead 
only the people worry especially those who make money from the 
annual pilgrimage of millions of leafpeepers who come north to 
view natures autumn splendor new englands sagging economy has 
many in the tourism business eager for a hearty foliage season 
this is a critical season for the travel industry said 
christopher barbieri president of the vermont chamber of commerce 
after a soft summer in the region were counting on this as a 
last blast before ski season 
but with wild cards such as the persian gulf crisis and 
increased competition from other states the new england fall 
season may be weaker than in the past 
this middle east crisis could not have come at a worse time 
barbieri said were watching to see how it affects the economic 
situation which will in turn affect us its a danger signal 
a slow summer in the northern new england states vermont new 
hampshire and maine has them looking to the midseptember to 
midoctober fall foliage season to bolster the travel and retail 
industries 
june and july were off by 5 and 15 percent said dick 
hamilton president of new hampshires white mountain attractions 
association if we can do well and go into a long cold winter 
with a good fall season people will be happy 
in maine where tourism is the states second largest industry 
behind paper production a weak season hurts the whole economy 
said john a johnson of the maine tourism office 
tourism is all weve got in massachusetts people who arent 
hired as waiters or chambermaids can get jobs in light industry we 
dont have that here he said oh do we need a good year 
the fall season has long been considered the gravy of the 
tourism year because little or no promotion was needed to get the 
people here 
but competition from other states that are heavily promoting the 
colors of their leaves even arkansas is jumping for the 
leafpeepers with a sophisticated advertising campaign is hurting 
the new england states barbieri said 
weve always taken it for granted but those days of assuming 
we have a corner on the leaf market are over he said other 
places have discovered that they have pretty leaves too 
new hampshire maine and vermont officials each estimate about a 
million people flock to their states in the brief but brilliant 
season 
but some of those people travel by car and may be inclined to 
stay at home this year because of rising gas prices 
if there is a fuel shortage scare then we will see a drop in 
business barbieri said and if gas prices rise above the 
psychological threshold of 2 a gallon people may think twice 
one indicator of a slow fall is the hotel and bus tour 
reservations some motor coach operators say the market to new 
england is softer than it has been in the past 
reservations are not where they were four or five years ago 
said peter tauk owner and general manager for tauk tours of 
westport conn new england this fall is soft for every tour 
operator 
the states are not forecasting a poor year just a year that 
could leave some general store tills a little less full 
barbieri said he expects the million tourists who will visit 
vermont twice the states population to spend more than 16 
million 
and the tourists in the fall are likely to be a bit freer with 
their money foliage draws the singles couples and senior 
citizens who may have a greater disposable income barbieri said 
these folks are less likely to ride the alpine slide but more 
likely to buy some things for christmas he said

after combatively defending himself at a public 
hearing against federal conflictofinterest charges neil bush now 
faces a potentially more damaging hurdle that could hit his wallet 
as well as his reputation 
in addition to the governments conflictofinterest case the 
presidents son faces a new 200 million lawsuit against him and 
other former directors of a failed colorado savings and loan the 
suit alleges that gross negligence by the directors contributed 
to the thrifts collapse 
that intensifies the pressure on neil bush 35 who already has 
become an unwilling symbol of the savings and loan crisis and a 
potential political liability for his father and the republican 
party 
the negligence suit filed sept 21 by the federal deposit 
insurance corp obviously made it more difficult for neil 
bush his attorney james nesland said in an interview friday 
bush testified for three hours thursday before an administrative 
law judge insisting that his business dealings with two denver 
developers did not conflict with his role as a director of 
silverado banking savings and loan association the developers 
kenneth good and bill walters eventually defaulted on more than 
132 million in loans from silverado 
silverado collapsed in late 1988 leaving us taxpayers with a 
1 billion tab for reimbursing depositors of the federally insured 
institution bush was a director of silverado from august 1985 to 
august 1988 quitting the post a few days after his father won the 
republican presidential nomination 
the federal office of thrift supervision is seeking an 
administrative order against bush that could lead to barring him 
from the banking and savings industry the regulators contend that 
bush failed to adequately inform fellow silverado directors of his 
business ties with good and walters who invested in bushs oil 
company jnb exploration 
administrative law judge daniel j davidson will examine 
testimony from last weeks hearing before him and is expected to 
recommend in january to ots director timothy ryan what sanctions 
if any should be taken against bush ryan is scheduled to make a 
decision in may and bush would have the right to appeal it to a 
federal court 
just four days before the start of the ots hearing in a federal 
courtroom in denver the fdic filed its lawsuit 
that cant be coincidental nesland said in an interview in 
his highrise office one has to recognize that those federal 
agencies act jointly 
the timing of the lawsuit he contended was symptomatic of 
the concerted effort by the banking agencies to prejudice his 
clients case 
the regulators insisted however that the suit was filed that 
day because the fdic had just finished its review of the matter 
after about six months of consideration 
politics simply are not involved said alan whitney an fdic 
spokesman in washington 
politics or no the civil lawsuit brings a new dimension to the 
bush case by threatening him with financial liability not just 
banishment from the banking and savings industry 
the liability insurance for silverado officers and directors 
lapsed in 1986 and it is unclear whether the defendants would be 
able to tap a special fund which the thrift had set aside for legal 
fees 
bushs financial situation also is uncertain he borrowed 
125000 for his new oil exploration venture bush energy co over 
the past 16 months from a denver cable television executive fred 
vierra according to public records 
as far as fred was concerned the loan was personal john 
neal a spokesman for vierra said friday 
fred didnt ask them what they were going to do with the 
money neal added referring to bush and his wife sharon 
he said the loans with an interest rate of around 10 percent 
were secured by a second lien on the bushs 550000 house in an 
upscale area of denver the first lien for 440000 is held by 
bank western 
bush has declined comment on the matter 
neal said vierra the president of united artists entertainment 
co of denver has known neil and sharon bush for about seven 
years

one of the worlds last great gothic churches 
was formally completed today with president bush and thousands of 
others gathering to see the final stone laid for what bush called 
the symbol of our nations spiritual life 
bush said the completion of the washington national cathedral 
recalled to him the words spoken by the late rev martin luther kig 
from its pulpit just days before the civil rights leader was 
assassinated 
he said we will bring about a new day of justice and 
brotherhood and peace and on that day morning stars will sing 
together and the sons of god will shout for joy bush said 
he said the cathedral in use during most of its construction 
years has been a place where the nation has come to understand to 
grieve to celebrate and to express concern 
and so we have constructed here this symbol of our nations 
spiritual life overlooking the center of our nations secular 
life the presdient said at the stonelaying ceremony 
he said the cathedral carries with it a constant reminder of 
our moral obligations 
it was a long time coming it was just 83 years ago to the day 
that president theodore roosevelt rode to mount st albans the 
highest point in the capital to see the foundation stone laid a 
crowd of 10000 braved threatening weather to join him 
cathedral spokeswoman jean grigsby said at least that many were 
expected today sunny and warm weather was forecast on sept 29 
1907 it had been raining and the sun burst through the clouds just 
moments before the ceremony began 
the stone reserved to the last is a 1000pound piece of indiana 
limestone carved in the shape of a folded leaf or flower it has 
been on display inside but was moved onto the grounds of the 
cathedral and lifted into place by a crane 
the stone rests on the southwest pinnacle of the cathedrals st 
paul tower 
the 873021square foot building roughly 14th century english 
gothic in style is the sixth largest cathedral in the world 
st peters in rome is the largest followed by one in seville 
spain the unfinished st john the divine in new york and 
cathedrals in liverpool england and milan italy 
richard t feller the canon clerk of the works at the 
cathedral said in a recent interview that he believes it will be 
the last built in the gothic style 
there isnt the craftsmanship available he said there 
isnt the design ability 
the 150000ton church was built in the traditional 
stoneonstone method of the medieval cathedral builders although 
with modern equipment the bearing walls have no steel 
reinforcement but are supported by stone buttresses 
construction began at the east end with the laying of the 
foundation stone beneath what is now the bethlehem chapel the twin 
towers at the west end a tenth of a mile away are named for st 
peter and st paul 
the cathedral is the headquarters of the episcopal diocese of 
washington but calls itself a house of prayer for all people 
funeral services for president eisenhower were held in the 
cathedral president woodrow wilson is buried there as bush 
recalled the rev martin luther king jr preached from its pulpit 
so has the rev desmond tutu 
work on the cathedral was halted during world war i and world 
war ii and stopped again in 1977 because of a shortage of funds it 
was resumed in 1980

negotiations between students and members of 
the board of trustees of the university of the district of columbia 
began again today but student leaders say the impasse over student 
protests wont end in time for classes to resume on monday 
honestly right now we dont anticipate an end by monday 
said student spokesman mark thomspson 
thompson said the board was undermining the talks through 
actions taken against the students 
while negotiations are contiuning all students here are in 
imminent danger he said 
we have been threatened by the board of trustees and by the 
mayor that police could move in at any given moment 
university spokesman john britton denied the allegations 
calling them hogwash 
he said the trustees have issued no threats 
thompson also said that the heat had been turned on the 
buildings they occupy during the day when temperatures are warm 
conversely thompson said the air conditioning was activated in 
the late night and early morning hours as it became cooler 
the cars of students participating in the protest also were 
being impounded thompson said 
udc officials said friday they would resume classes next week 
despite a student protest that has kept the school closed since 
wednesday 
we are prepared to move this institution forward the rev 
a knighton stanley a member of the schools board of trustees 
said friday night this board of trustees is prepared to open 
this institution on monday morning 
stanley declined to say how the 12000student public 
institution will be reopened if the dozens of students occupying 
university offices refuse to leave but he said negotiations would 
go on over the weekend 
former presidential candidate jesse jackson showed up on the 
campus friday night and said he was prepared to place himself 
between the students and police if a confrontation developed but 
he said i am convinced that rational and caring minds can arrive 
at a just and nonviolent conclusion 
the protesters seized control of two university buildings 
wednesday and asked fellow students to boycott classes accusing 
the board of taking actions that threatened the schools quality of 
education 
they asked for the resignation of the 11 mayoral appointees to 
the 15member board of trustees 
the students had cut off negotiations friday after board members 
refused to quit immediately stanley said 
the only thing they were willing to hear was the resignation 
of this board he said when i indicated to them that it would 
put them in a position of negotiating with nobody or with lame 
ducks or with nonentities they would not move in that regard and 
legal counsel did not move them to move beyond that 
the udc faculty senate has backed the students who also want 
improved academic and athletic programs compliance with education 
standards set by a regional accreditation board and an increased 
emphasis on africanamerican studies 
sam carcione president of the faculty union said he also 
wanted trustees to resign the board has been our enemy for a 
long time he said three city council members also called for 
the trustees to quit eventually 
trustee nira h long agreed to resign as the boards chairwoman 
on friday but said she would remain as a member 
the students had mayor marion barrys help and support until 
wednesday afternoon when he bowed out saying two attorneys 
advising the students had talked them into refusing to compromise 
but thompson said the students are in charge of the protest 
not the lawyers 
stanley said he and other school officials were willing to make 
changes 
we are prepared to admit that perhaps we and our predecessors 
have been somewhat remiss in governance of this institution he 
said we are more than willing to review the issues of governance 
of the university of the district of columbia with all aspects of 
the university community

environmentalists challenged the safety of frances 
big nuclear power network saturday a day after the end of an 
international conference touting nuclear energy as crucial to 
global development 
france has 50 nuclear power plants and obtains a higher portion 
of its electricity from nuclear power more than 70 percent than 
any country in the world 
leaders of the ecologyoriented green party accused energy 
authorities of lax response to investigations by safety experts 
who this week reported finding flaws in the water filtration 
systems at 17 french reactors 
officials said the flaws posed no immediate danger and would be 
fixed during a series of shutdowns at the affected plants 
on friday as the extent of the defects became known more than 
2000 scientists engineers and energy experts from 30 countries 
ended the weeklong european nuclear conference in lyon 
several speakers asserting the importance of nuclear power 
invoked the impact of the persian gulf crisis on the world oil 
market 
the only existing possibility is nuclear energy if we dont 
want to go toward major energy crises said remy carle a deputy 
director of staterun electricite de france which operates the 
nuclear power system 
he said standardized global safety regulations and better 
technical cooperation would help alleviate worries about nuclear 
safety 
defects in water filtration circuits were first detected at the 
golfech plant near toulouse in january authorities have been 
criticized for not determining until this month that the same flaws 
existed at 16 other 1300megawatt reactors 
said michel laveyrie head of the safety service that pursued 
the investigation im not shocked that there were anomalies in 
the system nothing can be 100 percent perfect but when you find 
one you must treat it rigorously this wasnt the case 
greens leader antoine waechter at a news conference denounced 
frances nuclear dictatorship and said officials lied by 
omission by failing to reveal the extent of the problems 
robert malgras a regional councilor in lorraine in eastern 
france called saturday for a meeting between the areas mayors and 
nuclear safety officials to discuss the flaws found at the areas 
cattenom plant 
we cant be content with an annual report he said we 
want to know whats going on

evidence the final battle between the lord and the enemies of 
israel and the coming of the savior may be near at hand the

on a bare hill raise a signal cry aloud to them wave the hand for 
them to enter the gates of the nobles

mighty men to execute my anger my proudly exulting ones

an uproar of kingdoms of nations gathering together the lord of 
hosts is mustering a host for battle they come from a distant 
land from the end of the heavens the lord and the weapons of his 
indignation to destroy the whole earth wail for the day of the 
lord is near as destruction from the almighty it will come

after this i saw another angel coming down from heaven having 
great authority and the earth was made bright with his splendor 
and he called out with a mighty voice 
fallen fallen is babylon the great it has become a dwelling 
place of demons a haunt of every foul spirit a haunt of every 
foul and hateful bird 
and the kings of the eart who committed fornication and were 
wanton with her will weep and wail over her when they see the 
smoke of her burning they will stand far off in fear of her 
torment and say 
alas alas thou great city thou mighty city babylon in one 
hour has thy judgment come

california voters will decide nov 6 
whether the tax revolt they started a dozen years ago with 
proposition 13 is dead 
the 28 propositions on the statewide ballot include three 
proposed tax increases and 14 bond issues that would increase state 
debt by 58 billion but another measure would disallow any tax 
increase approved by less than a twothirds majority of voters 
substantially strengthening the antitax movement 
the voters also will decide whether to ban cancercausing 
pesticides take new steps aimed at saving ancient redwoods throw 
out veteran lawmakers and put prisoners to work 
the 58 billion in bond proposals come just five months after 
voters approved 51 billion in state bonds on the june primary 
ballot 
the november bond measures would go for forest preservation 
housing loans universities schools prisons jails juvenile 
halls county courthouses water and sewer projects parks and 
child care centers 
tax measures include proposals to increase the state sales tax 
by a halfcent and to raise the state tax on alcoholic beverages 
but a rival initiative backed by the alcohol industry could wipe 
out those tax increases 
reflecting a growing public disdain for politicians as shown by 
the recent vote in oklahoma to limit politicians time in office 
two initiatives would turn out state elected officials after two to 
six terms depending on the measure and office 
local ballot propositions range from a measure to roll back rent 
controls in berkeley to a 12 million bond issue to purchase land 
for a butterfly habitat in affluent pacific grove 
a plan to move the san francisco giants 40 miles south to 
suburban santa clara depends on a santa clara county vote on a 
utility users tax to finance a proposed stadium for the national 
league baseball team 
four environmental measures on the statewide ballot pit 
conservationists and hollywood celebrities against farmers 
chemical manufacturers loggers and timber companies 
one sweeping initiative could affect how much californians pay 
for food and energy how many trees are planted in their 
neighborhoods and whether their takeout hamburgers keep warm in a 
foam box it also could regulate their air conditioning and require 
cars to average 50 miles per gallon of fuel by 2010 
dubbed big green by its backers proposition 128 would phase 
out pesticides known to cause cancer ban chemicals that harm the 
ozone and require a dramatic reduction in emissions of gases that 
contribute to global warming 
it also would authorize 300 million in bonds to preserve 
oldgrowth redwood trees restrict offshore oil drilling and create 
a new elective office of environmental czar 
opponents call proposition 128 the hayden initiative after 
one of its chief sponsors tom hayden the student antiwar leader 
of the 1960s who as a 50yearold state assemblyman has refocused 
his activism on environmental issues 
another measure sponsored by environmentalists seeks to save 
oldgrowth forests it would restrict clearcutting of timber 
impose new restrictions on logging and prohibit exports of logs 
harvested from state forests it also would provide 742 million in 
bond financing to preserve oldgrowth forests and retrain timber 
workers who might be forced out of work by its harvesting 
restrictions 
two rival measures backed by industry offer less restrictive 
regulation of pesticides and logging 
if two questions on the same subject pass they both take 
effect except for provisions that conflict in that case the 
courts have ruled the measure with the highest vote total 
prevails 
proposition 134 a nickeladrink surtax on wine beer and 
liquor would earmark the extra 760 million a year for drug and 
alcohol programs health care and law enforcement an 
industrybacked rival proposition 126 would raise the tax by a 
smaller amount roughly a penny a drink 
proposition 133 would raise the state sales tax by onehalf cent 
per dollar for four years the 15 billion to 21 billion in 
annual revenues would go for antidrug education drug treatment 
prisons and jails 
but proposition 136 which would take effect election day could 
nullify the alcohol and sales tax measures by amending the state 
constitution to require a twothirds vote for ballot measures that 
raise special taxes 
the question of whether such a proposition could actually 
nullify another vote taken the same day or could be applied only 
to future propositions would probably be decided in the courts 
proposition 136 is supported by followers of the late antitax 
crusaders howard jarvis and paul gann opponents say the real 
backers are alcohol interests who want to defeat the liquor tax 
proposition 131 would limit the governor and other statewide 
elected officials to two consecutive fouryear terms legislators 
would be limited to 12 years in office 
it also would set new limits on campaign contributions 
establish partial public financing for state campaigns restrict 
closed meetings of the legislature and create a new political 
corruption prosecutor 
under proposition 140 the governor and most other state 
officials down to senator could each serve up to eight years 
assembly members would be limited to six years it also would 
eliminate legislative pensions and cut the legislatures budget by 
about 40 percent

ethnic protesters clashed with 
police reinforcements saturday after seizing police weapons in two 
croatian towns and at least 27 people were detained authorities 
said one policeman was injured 
croatias interior ministry dispatched special police units to 
the trouble spots south of the croatian capital of zagreb and 
accused unnamed serb politicians of encouraging what it called 
terrorist acts 
serbs and croats yugoslavias two largest ethnic groups have 
been fierce rivals since the country was formed in 1918 
with increasing ethnic economic and political differences 
tugging at yugoslavias fragile sixrepublic federation the 
serbcroat rivalry is becoming more intense and violent 
the centerright coalition that ousted the communists in free 
elections in croatia last spring is pushing for a much looser 
confederation of sovereign states in yugoslavia 
serbia wants to maintain a more centralized system and vows to 
protect the serbs living in croatia if necessary by changing the 
borders between the two republics 
the croatian interior ministry said shots were fired on police 
friday in petrinja about 25 miles south of zagreb when they used 
tear gas and clubs against about 2000 minority serbs protesting 
seizures of weapons issued to them as police reservists 
one policeman was seriously injured and at least 27 of the 90 
people identified as responsible for the unrest were detained the 
ministry said according to the state news agency tanjug 
the local police chief was among those detained on suspicion of 
irresponsible work tanjug said 
tanjug also said about 1000 angry serbs from dvor 25 miles 
south of petrinja and from nearby bosanski novi in the republic 
of bosniahercegovina attacked dvors police station friday night 
the crowd overpowered police who did not use their firearms 
they occupied the building and seized unspecified weapons and 
ammunition tanjug said 
the serbs then barricaded roads leading into the town tanjug 
said special police units eventually arrived after midnight 
retook the police station and began recovering the confiscated 
weapons tanjug said 
it did not say whether force was used but it said all 
approaches to the police station and town hall were blocked police 
checked vehicles and passengers on access roads 
in addition to the seizure of weapons at the police station 
tanjug said the crowd stole hunting ammunition overnight from a 
weapons shop in dvor 
the developments point to recklessness of gangs of bandits 
trying to start an armed uprising in the republic of croatia 
the interior ministry statement said 
tension is rising throughout yugoslavia as the quarreling 
republics and their leaders move toward a showdown over the 
countrys future 
novembers free elections in bosniahercegovina which has 
strong serb croat and moslem groups and elections scheduled dec 
9 in serbia the largest yugoslav republic are expected to decide 
whether the federation stays together or falls apart 
slovenia which like croatia elected a centerright government 
in free elections in spring also advocates a confederation 
slovenia has threatened full independence if a new arrangement is 
not found and its parliament on friday adopted measures bringing 
the republic closer to rupture with the others

the washington national cathedral begun at 
the dawn of the century was formally completed saturday with 
president bush overseeing the laying of the final stone atop what 
he called this symbol of our nations spiritual life 
the fabric of this cathedral church of st peter and st paul 
is completed richard t feller canon of the clerk of the works 
announced to bush and the thousands who gathered at the cathedral 
bush told the crowd we have constructed here this symbol of 
our nations spiritual life overlooking the center of our nations 
secular life a symbol which combines the permanence of stone and 
of god both of which will outlast men and memories 
the visitors crowded the grounds atop mount st alban the 
capital citys highest point to witness the end of a project 
begun in 1907 
theodore roosevelt was president when construction began on what 
is now the worlds sixth largest cathedral 
roosevelt watched the laying of the foundation stone along with 
10000 people who braved chilly damp weather to join him 
saturdays celebrants gathered under sunny warm skies on a day 
that highlighted the grandeur of the gothicstyle cathedrals newly 
visible facade for years the front flanked by twin towers was 
obscured from passers by on wisconsin avenue by massive 
construction equipment and scaffolding 
today the massive limestone church is set back impressively 
from the broad avenue on 57 acres of landscaped grounds that also 
house three schools a college the offices of the episcopal 
diocese of washington and st albans parish church 
bush told the gathering the nation has come to the cathedral to 
grieve to understand to celebrate and to express concern 
he noted the funerals of presidents harry s truman and dwight 
eisenhower and vice president hubert h humphrey were held there 
over a threeday period at the dedication of the vietnam 
veterans memorial the names of 57939 lost americans were read in 
chapels other times we listened to bishop tutu billy graham and 
martin luther king 
he also recalled when the hostages were freed from our embassy 
in iran there was a service of thanksgiving 
we went to express our concern to hold a memorial for victims 
of the american embassy bombing in beirut a service of reflection 
on the 40th anniversary of hiroshima and even now prayers for our 
brave young servicemen and women in the harsh distant deserts 
he said referring to troops in the persian gulf region 
the final ceremonial stone was a 1000pound chunk of indiana 
limestone carved in the shape of a folded leaf or flower 
it was lifted into place atop the southwest pinnacle of the 
cathedrals st paul tower 
feller directed the delicate crane operation in a voice 
broadcast over loudspeaker the crowd below erupted in cheers when 
one of the two workmen exclaimed bulls eye as the stone was 
positioned over a mortar bed 
bush said the words spoken from the pulpit by the late rev 
martin luther king jr in his last sunday sermon should become 
our new vision 
he said we will bring about a new day of justice and 
brotherhood and peace and on that day morning stars will sing 
together and sons of god will shout for joy 
the 873021square foot cathedral in 14th century gothic style 
is bested in size only by st peters in rome the worlds 
largest followed by one in seville spain the unfinished st john 
the divine in new york and cathedrals in liverpool england and 
milan italy 
it is officially named the cathedral church of st peter and st 
paul 
feller said in a recent interview that he believes it will be 
the last built in the gothic style because that type of 
craftsmanship is no longer available 
he had said only the most optimistic person would have bet on 
the washington cathedral ever being finished 
in 1981 the protestantepiscopal foundation had fallen 107 
million in debt and work on the church stopped but a fundraising 
drive revived the project and the final phase of the nearly 
centurylong project began in 1983 
the 150000ton church was built in the traditional 
stoneonstone method of the medieval cathedral builders although 
with modern equipment the bearing walls are supported by stone 
buttresses 
president woodrow wilson is buried there so is helen keller 
whose memorial is in braille 
work on the cathedral was halted during world war i and world 
war ii and stopped again in 1977 because of a shortage of funds it 
was resumed in 1980

a kuwaiti businessman said saturday that 
he saw iraqi soldiers summarily execute eight men accused of 
resistance activities in occupied kuwait 
the eight were murdered by iraqi soldiers who shot them with 
pistols said the businessman who spoke through a satellite 
telephone conversation a rarity in this region since the aug 2 
takeover of kuwait by iraqs forces 
each victim was killed with one bullet in the head and another 
in the heart he said adding that the killings occurred sept 
21 
the same day the iraqis rounded up 17 businessmen and former 
parliamentarians on charges of refusing to cooperate with the 
occupation authorities said the businessman who spoke on 
condition his name was not used 
the 17 included faisal alsanie former parliamentarian and 
member of the opposition group that had been demanding more 
democracy in kuwait along with businessmen brothers khaled adnan 
and salah alwasmi he said 
they were arrested and moved along with their families to 
unknown places possibly to iraq he said also last week the 
kuwaiti red crescent society was closed and the six members of its 
board board were seized and taken away 
the red crescent officers were taken to the southern iraqi basra 
region he said 
the report was the latest reaching bahrain from the estimated 
300000 kuwaitis living under iraqi occupation 
things are getting real bad here said the businessman 
food is scarce and the iraqis are becoming extremely ferocious 
 
he said the kuwaiti resistance is doing a good job but not 
good enough 
our beloved and beautiful kuwait has been reduced to a 
shambles in daytime the city is like a cemetry oppressive and 
silent he said after sunset we hear only the sound of death 
the rattle of machinegun fire the thud of cannons and blasts of 
bombs 
the telephone connection was clear the businessman sounded 
tired and shaken saying its a big risk making this call they 
iraqis kill kuwaitis in cold blood 
regular telephone and telex links between kuwait and the rest of 
the world were cut off in the first days of the invasion 
the exiled ruler of the invaded country sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah gave president bush a graphic account of the situation in 
the country under the iraqi occupation 
as a result of these reports and other accounts of violence and 
pillaging bush is reviewing the possibility of seeking additional 
united nations action beyond the existing trade blockade according 
to bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft 
scowcroft said friday that military action was one possibility 
kuwaitis fleeing since the invasion have been providing frequent 
accounts of oppression rape and plunder by the iraqi occupation 
forces the londonbased human rights group amnesty international 
recently sent a team to the gulf to try to investigate the reports 
the businessmans report was the first about an iraqi crackdown 
on members of the opposition ranks in kuwait who had been on a 
collision course with the emir over the months seeking the return 
of a westernstyle parliament but they had always affirmed loyalty 
to the emir 
at the start of the iraqi invasion there were claims that kuwait 
opposition leaders would be asked to form a government to run their 
country when the iraqis withdrew instead baghdad announced the 
formation of a 9member provisional kuwait free government led 
by an obscure col alaa hussein ali 
other kuwaiti refugees reaching bahrain said that they saw alaa 
on television with iraqi president saddam hussein requesting unity 
between their two countries the same day kuwait was annexed by 
iraq and alaa was never seen again and was presumed executed they 
said

dog in for a rabies vaccination watched as his pet was mistakenly 
put to sleep 
it was a real tragedy very serious said dr keith 
sultemeier the veterinarian who operates the clinic in azle 
northwest of fort worth 
fifteenyearold tony mccarty and his mother brought the dog a 
2yearold pit bullchow mixbreed named runt into the clinic 
thursday about the same time a female pit bullchow mix was 
brought in for euthanasia sultemeier said the lady and her son 
came in with a dog for a fairly straightforward vaccination and 
walked out without the dog we are at fault the veterinarian 
said 
the boy was with runt when the dog got the lethal injection 
instead of the rabies shot to make up for the error sultemeier 
bought mccarty a fullblooded chow puppy 
mccartys mother pam peyton said she wont sue sultemeier 
i dont see any reason to ruin his practice over this she 
said hes gotten us a new dog and said he will take steps 
whatever that means to make sure it doesnt happen again and i 
believe he will

a proiranian shiite moslem leader on 
saturday pointed to renewed ties between tehran and london and said 
washington should improve its conduct to help win the freedom 
of six american captives 
te leader hussein musawi said he does not expect the early 
release of any of the us hostages not before americans 
improve their conduct like the british started doing 
britain and iran restored diplomatic ties thursday 18 months 
after severing relations following irans death decree against 
author salman rushdie a british citizen irans late ayatollah 
khomeini said rushdie should be killed because his novel the 
satanic verses defamed islam 
if any american were freed musawi said it ought to be terry 
anderson the longestheld foreign captive anderson 42 the chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press was kidnapped 
march 16 1985 
i hope that anderson will be the first to be releasd when 
conditions are ripe for american hostage to be freed musawi 
said 
the americans should apologize to the moslems for their 
traditional support for israel they should withdraw from the 
persian gulf he said they should release iranian funds 
they should treat moslems with respect 
asked if he had any information on andersons whereabouts or 
health condition musawi said no one heard that there is 
anything wrong with andersons health 
musawi hinted that one of the four british hostages might be 
freed as a result of the renewal of the renewed diplomatic ties 
between britain and iran but said he did not have accurate 
information on any specific plans to free one of them 
asked about former irish hostage brian keenans contention that 
anglican church envoy terry waite had fallen ill in captivity 
musawi said i dont know anything about terry waite except what 
we read in the press attributed to keenan i hope he is in good 
health 
waite 51 personal emissary of archbishop of canterbury robert 
runcie disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving his hotel in 
moslem west beirut for a meeting with a representative of islamic 
jihad or islamic holy war the underground faction believed to 
hold anderson and thomas sutherland 
no group has claimed responsibility for waites abduction but 
keenan released in august said he was held with the anglican 
envoy for a while in the same house 
the westerners are believed held by proiranian shiite moslem 
groups musawi denied his islamic amal movement group was holding 
hostages but said the islamic leadership in iran is the only 
force outside lebanon that can influence these special islamic 
security groups 
the 13 western captives in addition to the six americans and 
four britons also include two west germans and an italian

here is the text of president bushs remarks 
at the celebration of the completion of the washington national 
cathedral on saturday 
 
thank you sir thank you very much its a pleasure to be here 
thank you all thank you all ladies and gentlemen thank you 
bishop browning 
please thank you bishop browning and a its a great 
pleasure to be with you again and a special thanks to bishop 
haines and special thanks to colonel broussard and our wonderful 
marine band 
thank you ladies and gentlemen 
and a warm welcome to all of you out there standing and seated 
in this splendid scene of bright unity across these gorgeous 
grounds the clergy and other interfaith leaders members of this 
great washington national cathedral representatives of our 
government and other countries and the men and women who have 
worked on this magnificent structure and all our friends 
barbara and i feel privileged privileged to be with you on 
this day of ecumenical thanksgiving 
theres one man mentioned by bishop browning whos gone before 
us yet who is in so many of our hearts today the late episcopal 
bishop of washington john walker 
like many of you here i treasured his friendship and i valued 
his counsel and were he still with us the stonesetting would be 
the culmination of his lifes work and his lifes dream 
but tomorrow on the first anniversary of his death the very 
first service will be held in the completed cathedral and id like 
to dedicate these remarks to his memory 
what an extraordinary moment this is eightythree years ago 
this day this hour our predecessors here laid a cornerstone and 
now eight decades later we look at mount st alban and say 
here we have built our church 
not just a church a house of prayer for a nation built on 
the rock of religious faith a nation we ceebrate as one nation 
under god a nation whose founding president george washington 
said no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the 
invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men more than the 
people of the united states 
and so we have constructed here this symbol of our nations 
spiritual life overlooking the center of our nations secular 
life a symbol which combines the permanence of stone and of god 
both of which will outlast men and memories a symbol that carries 
with it a constant reminder of our moral obligations 
you know whenever i look up at this hill and see the cathedral 
keeping watch over us i feel the challenges reaffirmed 
woodrow wilsons last public words inscribed here on the wall 
next to his tomb say it best our civilization cannot survive 
materially unless it be redeemed spiritually 
to do that we must govern by the imperatives of a strong moral 
compass a compass based on the kind of purity and vision and 
values that inspired our early founders a compass that would lead 
us to enter this building through its oldest door the way of 
peace 
and a compass oriented to the words of saint paul who gazes 
down from our left and now abideth faith hope and love these 
three but the greatest of these is love 
our personal family compass has for many years led us here for 
public and private worship we were neighbors when we lived at the 
vice presidents residence and before that our children went to 
school at st albans and i was a board member at national 
cathedral school and ken and martin baptized one of our 
grandchildren and two sons were confirmed here and barbara has 
even read the christmas story 
ill stop in case each of you want to tell me of your family 
connection with this wonderful institution 
one of the high points of our inaugural weekend was the prayer 
service here part of a national day of prayer across the country 
i want to take a moment to say goodbye to provost perry charles 
perry who so beautifully organized that service and who is 
leaving tomorrow after a dozen years of devoted work 
and i would like to share with you some thoughts on why we find 
this cathedral so moving 
to begin with there is profound meaning in the physical beauty 
the devout say they can see here the invisible hand of god in the 
visible handiwork of man 
we all can see in this astonishing place of stone and light a 
massive 300 millionpound mountain of indiana limestone created as 
an act of worship 
i want my grandchildren to come here i want them to feel 
reassured that there always will be comfort here in the presence of 
god and i want them to delight in the colors and the sounds and 
the tapestries and mosaics to the fine old hymns 
and i want them to know a very special way of understanding this 
wondrous place studying the brilliant stained glass windows from 
where we now stand the rose window high above seems black and 
formless to some perhaps but when we enter and see it backlit by 
the sun it dazzles in astonishing splendor 
and it reminds us that without faith we too are but stained 
glass windows in the dark

but the magnificent story of this place then is human as well 
as spiritual the greatness of this masterpiece comes from the 
loving and sometimes lifelong dedication of the finest craftsmen 
for some it has been a multigenerational work son following son 
throughout the birth of this house of worship 
many of these workers are now gone for their memorial simply 
look around you 
but most of the gifts that made this great american dream a 
reality gifts of funds work love spirit and prayer were 
from the people who are its congregation the millions across 
america 
they caught the exhilaration of the dream that seized those who 
envisioned this cathedral and yet who didnt live to see it a 
reality men like pierre lenfant whose 1791 plan for washington 
included a great church for national purposes or henry 
satterlee this citys first episcopal bishop who yearned for a 
place forever open and free and the members of congress who 
voted the 1893 charter of foundation 
there are some here who share that dream in a unique way they 
were also here 83 years ago today for the laying of the 
cornerstone and they remember sunlight shining through the rain 
while 10000 watched and cheered 
for instance elsie brown is now 90 but was seven when her 
mother took her to that event 
nintyfiveyearold taylor eicher was 12 when he donned his 
cassock to sing in the boys choir that noon and ruth oliphant 
now 98 walked over with her other 15yearold cathedral school 
classmates 
it was a very american ceremony president teddy roosevelt 
spoke and bishop satterlee tapped the stone with the gavel which 
george washington had used to set the cornerstone of the united 
states capitol 
that was only right for a cathedral whose style is 14th century 
gothic and yet also very much american a cathedral thats not just 
about faith but was also about a nation and its people a 
cathedral where mosaics of the great seal of the united states and 
the state seals are set into the floors where bays honor 
washington lincoln stonewall jackson and robert e lee where you 
can find an eagle a bison and even a stained stainedglass 
codfish 
or needlepoint memorials or to herman melville alexander graham 
bell harriet tubman and john fitzgerald kennedy where lie the 
graves of president wilson admiral george dewey and helen keller 
where the mesmerizing stainedglass space window included 
includes a moon rock given by astronaut michael collins who went 
to school on these very grounds at st albans 
and where an unexpected shaft of sun can leave a stunning 
memory the statue of george washington strong and solid and 
earthbound suddenly dappled by the brilliance of stainedglass 
light 
its a place where the history of the cathedral and of the 
country have been interwoven 
when we need to grieve we come here we held funerals for 
presidents truman and eisenhower and vice president humphrey the 
burial of president wilson and a fantastic memorial service for 
winston churchill 
when we want to understand we come here over a threeday 
period at the dedication of the vietnam memorial the names of 
57939 lost americans were read in chapels 
other times we listened to bishop tutu or billy graham or 
martin luther king 
when we want to celebrate we come here when the hostages were 
freed from our embassy in tehran there was a service of 
thanksgiving and later a national prayer service for the 50th 
presidential inauguration 
and bells peal out on the national holidays 
when we want to express our concern we come here to hold a 
memorial for victims of the american embassy bombing in beirut a 
service of reflection on the 40th anniversary of hiroshima and 
even now prayers for our brave young service men and women in the 
harsh distant deserts 
and so today we prepare to raise that final 100 1008 pound 
grand finial to its spot on one of the great pinnacles of st 
pauls tower the last step in an eightdecadelong journey 
and now that our national treasure is complete how will it fit 
into our lives 
i would love to see the entire country discover this cathedral 
as americas resource refuge and reminder somewhere to strengthen 
the nations heart we should consecrate this place in the words of 
isaiah for mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all 
people all people all america 
and we should come here to pledge ourselves to the work of 
martin luther king envisioned from the splendid canterbury pulpit 
in his last sermon three days before he died and he said we 
will bring about a new day of justice and brotherhood and peace 
and on that day morningstars will sing together and the sons of 
god will shout for joy 
for eight decades the dream of a completed cathedral dominated 
this hill and now dr kings words should become our new vision 
eightythree years ago on this spot president teddy roosevelt 
said god speed the work begun this noon 
and today i say god speed the work completed this noon and the 
new work yet to begin 
god bless all of you this magnificent cathedral and the united 
states of america thank you all very much

a trash bin last year were identified as the wife and motherinlaw 
of a new jersey police officer already charged with murder in their 
deaths 
diane palumbo woodrow 32 and yolanda palumbo 67 both of 
williamstown nj were identified friday after a review of dental 
records and forensic evidence from an autopsy maryland state 
police said 
the bodies were discovered aug 12 1989 in a trash bin at the 
rear of a joppatowne shopping center 
sgt andrew j woodrow 26 a sixyear veteran of the woodbury 
nj police department was indicted sept 13 in new jersey for 
murder over the past year the indictment charges he cashed 13 
social security checks issued to his motherinlaw worth more than 
5000 
confirming that the bodies found in maryland were mrs woodrow 
and mrs palumbo bolstered the prosecutions case said gloucester

bail noting that woodrow if convicted could be sentenced to 
death he is being held at the ocean county jail in toms river 
nj 
woodrow and his wife married in 1986 lived with mrs palumbo 
at her williamstown mobile home hickey said woodrow continued to 
live in the mobile home before moving to west deptford nj in

in his six years with the woodbury force he was promoted to 
sergeant last may

six blacks were killed in two 
clashes saturday including three youths who died when 
gasolinesoaked tires were put around their necks and set ablaze 
police said 
a large group of blacks assaulted the three youths aged 19 18 
and 16 then killed them by the necklace method saturday 
morning in evaton a black township south of johannesburg police 
said 
authorities gave no motive for the attack but rival black 
factions have been battling in townships outside johannesburg since 
early august leaving about 800 dead 
also three blacks were shot dead in the crossroads community 
outside cape town in an ongoing battle between squatters and 
residents in formal brick houses police said 
in other developments a rightwing white in detention without 
charge told supporters to accept a government offer granting 
amnesty to people who surrendrr illegal weapons 
piet rudolph deputy leader of the boer state party said this 
call does not mean i have given up the struggle for our 
freedom 
but in a letter released by police rudolph conceded that no 
one with a few guns will be able to obtain the declared goal of 
the overthrow of the government 
the boer state party is one of several rightwing groups that 
want strict apartheid and have vowed to resist president fw de 
klerks plans to share power with the black majority 
rudolph was arrested sept 17 after several months in hiding 
while underground he declared war on the government and claimed 
responsibility for bomb attacks on offices of de klerks ruling 
national party 
meanwhile african national congress leaders said saturday that 
apartheid was dying but the government was still attempting to 
undermine the anc 
the government has got a double agenda anc treasurer thomas 
nkobi said in cape town one is to negotiate with the anc for the 
purposes of responding to international pressure and two 
promoting nationwide violence to weaken the anc 
nkobi and other anc leaders addressed delegates at regional 
conferences in cape town and johannesburg they were the first such 
anc conferences in south africa since 1959 the year before the anc 
was outlawed the anc the largest black opposition group was 
legalized in february 
the government has denied charges that police have fueled 
fighting between the anc and the rival inkatha movement in the 
townships outside johannesburg 
the government points to a sharp decrease in the fighting since 
emergency police measures were announced two weeks ago 
in johannesburg anc leader walter sisulu told delegates that 
apartheid was near its end 
the period we find ourselves in is ripe for the transfer of 
power to the people he said

does nessie scotlands fabled loch ness 
monster have a cousin 
a handful of sightings of huge serpentlike creatures in lake 
erie were recorded in 1985 and 1987 but things remained quiet 
until sept 4 
thats when harold bricker and his family returned from a 
fishing trip with a new sighting and monster mania began spreading 
along lakefront communities 
the brickers said they saw a large creature moving in the water 
about 1000 feet from their boat they described it as black about 
35 feet long and with a snakelike head it moved as fast as their 
boat 
i told my son that i wanted to get a look at it the 
67yearold bricker said my son said no way that thing is 
bigger than we are so we stayed where we were 
bricker his wife cora and son robert told rangers at east 
harbor state park about what theyd seen 
the creature has since been reported by five people on three 
separate occasions including a huron firefighter and a 50yearold 
woman from pennsylvania vacationing at her lake erie cottage 
john schaffner editor of a weekly newspaper in port clinton 
has set up a tollfree phone for people to call if they see the 
serpent 
he also ran a contest to name it south bay besse was chosen in 
part because of the location of the davis besse nuclear power plant 
near port clinton not to mention that besse rhymes with 
nessie 
the story of the monster in loch ness in northcentral scotland 
dates back centuries and is worth tens of millions in tourist 
dollars to the region each year three years ago a milliondollar 
scientific expedition to find her turned up just vague sonar 
readings but the legend remains 
any similar effort to find a creature in lake erie would be even 
more difficult at 240 miles its more than 10 times as long as 
loch ness 
thomas solberg owner of huron lagoon marina has offered a 
5000 reward to anyone who captures south bay besse alive he also 
posted a sign at his marina calling it the future home of the lake 
erie sea serpent 
but while some people are having fun with the creature marine 
researchers remain skeptical 
fred snyder a researcher with the ohio sea grant an 
organization that examines great lakes issues said it is highly 
unlikely a monster is living in lake erie 
he added that hes not trying to be the sour old guy who 
throws a bucket of water on things and loves stories about the 
loch ness monster 
but he noted that loch ness is old while lake erie is a 
youngster geologically speaking 
a lot of people kind of assume like most places in the world 
it must be millions and millions of years old he said its 
not the case the glaciers receded and the area stabilized about 
12000 years ago which geologically is just yesterday 
so the monster really cant be anything left over from the 
dinosaur days because its just too young 
snyder also noted that no sightings were reported before the 
mid1980s and he said he doubts a big sea creature could have 
gotten in from the atlantic ocean because of the difficulties of 
navigating the st lawrence seaway 
the sturgeon lake eries largest fish can grow to 300 pounds 
and 10 feet in length but it is on the endangered species list and 
is a bottom dweller snyder said 
he speculated monster sighters may have seen a school of fish 
and mistakenly thought it was a creature 
i truthfully dont know what people have been seeing but its 
hard for me to believe that there could be a monster out there 
he said

the waters of the mississippi casts off on its final 
dinneranddancing cruise tonight before opening a new chapter in 
river history as the nations largest floating casino 
first thing monday morning workers will start tearing up the 
insides of the 57yearold president a national historic landmark 
theyll rip out the huge polished hard maple dance floor the 
carpeting the tiles 
come april after a 10 million facelift the president will 
reemerge with 27000 square feet of gaming space more than some 
las vegas or atlantic city casinos 
its going to dazzle them capt bob goodman said 
goodman sat recently at a table in the ballroom on the boats 
main deck and described his mixed feelings about the boats future 
the thing that really tears me up is that dance floors going 
to come up thats the heart and soul of this boat you can just 
imagine the proposals that have been made the sweet nothings that 
have been whispered on that floor said goodman who has worked 
on the boat since 1985 literally millions of people have danced 
on this floor 
the old riverboat holds fond memories for george and margery 
perry who have been doing the ballroom fox trot on the president 
for at least 25 years 
weve been referred to as the black fred astaire and ginger 
rogers said perry 70 
the presidents history dates back to 1924 when it was a 
sidewheel steamboat called the cincinnati an overnight packet boat 
carrying freight and passengers from cincinnati to louisville 
as more of the nations transportation needs were handled by the 
expanding railroad streckfus steamers in st louis bought the 
boat and transformed it into the president the countrys first 
allsteel riverboat 
five decks tall and nearly a football field long the president 
conducted daytime and moonlight excursions in st louis during the 
spring and summer and in new orleans during the fall and winter 
from 1933 to 1940 
in 1941 the president took up official residence in new 
orleans returning to st louis only when nww 2000 horsepower 
diesel engines were installed in 1978 replacing the paddlewheels 
in 1985 the deteriorating riverboat was bought by john e 
connelly a pittsburghbased riverboat entrepreneur and developer 
and was returned to st louis 
the first time i saw the president i said thats a 
riverboat thats a real boat goodman said i fell in love 
with it

with all the glamour and allure of the river and gambling 
connelly said im very excited shes had a great past and i 
think her future is very bright 
it will be the end of an era for israel izzy gorman who has 
worked on the president since 1939 when he was 10 years old and 
working as a captains boy for capt roy streckfus 
through the years gorman has met such entertainers as louis 
armstrong fats domino al hirt chuck berry and many others who 
have worked the president 
but gorman was more philosophical than sad about the presidents 
last cruise 
regardless of how they change it its still the same boat 
its not laid up in some dirty old wharf or what not shes still 
sailing still living and im proud of that 
everybody needs a new suit once in a while

a senior iraqi official denied saturday 
that foreigners would be deprived of food supplies when a rationing 
system begins this week 
iraqi officials had threatened last week to withhold food from 
nonarab foreigners starting monday 
but on saturday mohammed mehdi saleh minister of trade and 
finance told the iraqi news agency that rationing would provide 
basic foodstuffs in equal share for for iraqis arabs diplomatic 
missions foreigners working in iraq and all those who arrived as 
guests of iraq without any preferential treatment for any group 
guests of iraq is the term baghdad applies to westerners who 
have been taken to strategic sites to serve as shields against 
potential military attack 
there are no instructions whatsoever to deprive any foreign 
nationals of the right to benefit from the ration card system as 
claimed by some hostile and suspicious media reports within the 
context of their rabid campaign against iraq saleh said 
he accused foreign governments of embarking on a smear 
campaign against iraqs treatment of the foreigners 
iraqi leaders had said wednesday they would cut off food to 
nonarabs in the country and announced at the same time they 
planned to extend nationwide rationing to rice flour sugar tea 
and cooking oil bread is already rationed 
word of the planned food cutoff came from diplomats speaking on 
condition of anonymity who quoted a foreign ministry memorandum as 
saying rations would be suspended because of the latest un 
security council resolution it imposed an air embargo on iraq 
the memorandum was delivered to all nonarab missions 
we received a memorandum explaining that the governments 
priority is to feed the iraqi population a western diplomat 
said they said they contacted arab diplomats who told them they 
had not received any such notice

secretary of state james a baker iii met 
his counterpart from vietnam on saturday taking a step toward 
normalizing relations severed since the vietnam war 
they were the highestlevel talks between the two countries 
since the war ended in april 1975 
vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach promised his 
country would withdraw all its military advisers from cambodia but 
he provided no timetable for the withdrawal 
baker offered to lift the usual travel restrictions on 
vietnamese diplomats which limit them to a 25mile radius of new 
york city so they can meet in washington with relatives of 
americans missing in vietnam 
when asked if the talks were a step toward normalizing 
relations a senior state department said it would be fair to 
say it was a step in that direction although it did not constitute 
commencement of normalization 
speaking on condition of anonymity he said restoration of 
relations would depend on vietnams cooperation on two issues 
resolving the war in cambodia and providing a full accounting 
of americans missing since the vietnam war 
the official said progress on the cambodian issue hinges on the 
signature of a peace treaty in paris by the parties to end the 
conflict and the implementation of a un peace plan in which un 
administrators would run major cambodian government ministries 
until new elections are held 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in 1978 has withdrawn all or 
most of its 140000 troops from cambodia western intelligence 
officials believe 
it was not immediately known how many military advisers remain 
in cambodia but the state department official said there are 
more than dozens 
we have withdrawn our forces and we will withdraw all our 
advisers thach said before the meeting with baker he added that 
vietnam had agreed to international monitoring in cambodia 
on the powmia issue the state department official said thach 
would go to washington to meet with gen john vesey president 
bushs special emissary on the issue and with anne griffiths head 
of the national league of families of missing americans 
progress on that issue will depend on the outcome of that 
meeting which will be planned in the next few days the official 
said 
washington wants the fullest possible accounting of the 
missing americans the official said 
we would certainly want progress on cambodia and powmia to be 
matched by progress in the usvietnam relationship he said 
the private meeting with baker followed a series of three 
sessions this summer between vietnams un ambassador and state 
department officials vietnam has been seeking to forge diplomatic 
ties with the united states 
a crowd of several hundred boisterous anticommunist protesters 
rallied outside the waldorfastoria hotel where the meeting was 
held when thach left the hotel and heard their chants he ducked 
into his waiting car and left without making any statement 
baker stayed inside to hold more meetings with other leaders 
president bushs administration has been expanding diplomatic 
contacts with both hanoi and the vietnameseinstalled government in 
cambodia the united states had supported the rebel resistance but 
officials in washington are now worried that a communist rebel 
faction that once ruled cambodia will force its way back to power 
vietnam installed the cambodian government when it invaded that 
country in 1978 to oust the communist faction the khmer rouge 
during its rule from 197579 the khmer rouge killed hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians directly through purges and executions and 
indirectly through starvation and the hardship of a radical 
agrarian relocation program

a court ruling upholding an amnesty for 
alleged human rights violators during the former military regime 
will not prevent finding the truth and making justice about 
abuses a leader of the new civilian government said saturday 
enrique krauss acting as government chief in the absence of 
president patricio aylwin who is in new york to attend un 
meetings said the supreme court ruling causes a clash between 
the executive and the court 
the court ruled friday 151 that the amnesty law covering 1973 
to 1978 was constitutional and ordered judges to halt any human 
rights investigations or trials linked to incidents during the 
fiveyear period 
the amnesty law was issued in 1978 by gen augusto pinochet who 
took power in a violent 1973 coup and ruled until lastmarch 
after seizing power the military launched severe repression on 
supporters of the toppled leftist government thousands were 
arrested executed tortured or forced into exile the most serious 
violations occurred during the period covered by the amnesty 
krauss however suggested the government may continue probes of 
alleged abuses for the entire 16year pinochet rule even if the 
courts do not but he acknowledged the investigations covering the 
197378 period would not lead to trials 
this ruling can not prevent the government from pursuing its 
goal of finding the truth and seeking justice said krauss 
krauss stressed the government respects the court ruling 
aylwin who succeeded pinochet last march named a ninemember 
special pannel to investigate rights abuses and send the findings 
to the courts for trial 
since may the panel has documented about 3200 killings linked 
to the military according to commission president raul rettig 
the supreme court ruling was made following a legal challenge of 
the amnesty law by communist lawyer alfonso insunza who claimed it 
was unconstitutional 
the ruling immediately affects at least 15 cases including the 
finding of mass graves containing the remains of 106 people 
believed killed for political reasons 
the situation poses a sensitive problem to the aylwin 
government which faces pressure from the victims relatives and 
political groups and the danger of an angry reaction from the 
military 
pinochet remained commander of the powerful 60000man army 
after handing the presidency to aylwin a clause in the 1980 
constitution written by the pinochet regime prevents his dismissal 
before leaving power pinochet repeatedly warned he would not 
tolerate any of my men being brought to trial on human rights 
charges 
but some pinochet supporters including former justice minister 
monica madariaga one of the writers of the amnesty law said they 
would not oppose government inquiries into alleged abuses

other fuel delivery cutbacks according to a government decree 
cited saturday 
special coupons will be issued to ensure the gas rationing is

multinational force in the persian gulf region president zhelyu 
zhelev said during a visit to washington this week 
the decision was welcomed by the newspaper of zhelevs union of 
democratic forces the main opposition party but was questioned 
saturday by the governing socialists 
since we are not officially invited by the united nations it 
looks more like an interference in internal affairs it would be a 
great risk to start down this path socialist party spokesman 
dimitar iontchev wrote in the partyaffiliated duma newspaper 
duma also quoted the head of the movement for rights and 
freedoms which represents many of bulgarias ethnic turkish 
minority as saying he opposed the dispatch of bulgarian troops

sitting in her study with the dust from a 
desert refugee camp covering her cowboy boots jordans queen noor 
worried that a decade of progress was slipping away because of the 
persian gulf crisis 
to lose the momentum after painstakingly building it for so 
many years would really be a tragedy said the americanborn 
wife of king hussein 
all our people have been hit pretty hard we have to help them 
keep hope in the future they mustnt lose heart during this 
difficult time she said were not going to let all our work 
die 
by almost any measure life for the nearly 3 million people of 
jordan has improved the past 10 years life expectancy is up 
infant mortality is down more girls were going to school 
although unemployment remains high and income low the country 
met or surpassed international monetary fund targets and was set to 
begin repaying its 83 billion debt 
wed finally reached a point where things were working that 
of course has been completely changed by the present 
circumstances said the former elizabeth halaby a 
princetoneducated architect and planner who married the king in 
1978 
tens of thousands of refugees from iraq and kuwait have overrun 
the kingdom since the iraqs aug 2 invasion and the nations 
small but valuable tourist industry collapsed 
meanwhile king hussein has been criticized for joining only a 
handful of nations that did not fully denounce iraq 
the queen who played a central role in the good times is now a 
key player in the bad she has taken personal responsiblity for the 
welfare of refugees which reached about 100000 at its peak 
shes now in the united states attending a conference on 
children at the united nations and presenting jordans position in 
the crisis to groups in washington dc where she was born 
queen noor whose name in arabic means light of hussein 
surprised many who expected her to wrap herself in luxury and 
quietly raise a family after marrying the king 
jordanians didnt immediately warm to the idea of an american 
queen who has been chastized for reported extravagances and is 
sometimes misunderstood 
i wanted to come to the arab world and contribute in any way i 
could knowing id come from a privileged environment where id had 
the best of everything i wanted to give something back said the 
39yearold queen who met king hussein while working as a planner 
for royal jordanian airlines 
so here i am in this fantastic privileged position able to 
do what i want i consider myself very lucky even in the worst of 
times 
she has sponsored clinics and schools in crowded palestinian 
refugee camps and remote bedouin villages about the time her 
fourth child was born five years ago she set up the noor 
alhussein foundation to coordinate her social and cultural work 
the queen was also the catalyst for a cottage industry of 
artisans that has caused a renaissance in jordanian crafts 
but a group of jordanian businesswomen who met with the queen 
recently complained their factories and stores were suffering from 
the nearclosing of jordans only port at aqaba and the un trade 
sanctions against iraq 
we dont know how much longer this is going to go on said a 
matchstick manufacturer we cant plan ahead we cant ship our 
stock by sea and we cant sell to our biggest customer 
with the tourist industry now moribund the jordan design and 
trade center has a new importance as it seeks to develop export 
markets 
about 1000 women sell their richly textured rugs colorful 
embroidered pillows and dresses and other goods through the center 
which just received a 100000 un grant to teach management 
skills to the women 
in a room across from the meeting of jordanian businesswomen a 
dozen palestinian women their heads covered in moslem style 
listened to a lecture on quality control 
when the queen entered nobody got up and the women showed more 
curiosity than warmth 
shes accepted but not loved said a jordanian journalist 
familiar with the royal family no matter what she does shell 
never be an arab and will never have the affection of the people 
that an arab woman would receive without doing anything

jurors in the trial of an art gallery accused 
of violating obscenity laws by displaying sexually explicit 
photographs were given plenty to think about even before they were 
empaneled last week 
if you were shown a picture of a homosexual act would you be 
offended marc mezibov an attorney for the contemporary arts 
center asked prospective jurors does it make him mapplethorpe 
any less of an artist because he was a homosexual 
the gallery and its director dennis barrie are charged with 
pandering obscenity and using children in nudityrelated material 
the charges were based on seven photographs that were part of the 
175picture exhibit robert mapplethorpe the perfect moment 
the exhibit drew more than 80000 people during its sevenweek 
appearance it closed may 26 and is on display in boston a grand 
jury viewed the exhibit april 7 before returning the indictments 
defense lawyers say the controversial work has artistic and 
political merit but the prosecution says the photos violate 
obscenity laws 
you understand that the arts community is not on trial here 
assistant city prosecutor frank prouty asked a prospective juror 
the issue is whether or not these pictures are obscene 
attorney h louis sirkin representing barrie tried to steer 
jurors in another direction 
can you accept that photography is an art form sirkin 
asked he spent some time talking about the intent and feeling that 
goes into a floral display 
in his opening statement friday sirkin said that art is not 
always to be pleasing to our eyes 
art is to tell us something about ourselves to make us look 
inside ourselves and to look at the world around us he said 
by doing that it the mapplethorpe exhibit does without 
question have serious value both artistically and politically 
the us supreme court has said the test of obscenity is whether 
the dominant theme of the artwork appeals to a prurient interest in 
sex whether the work is patently offensive based on contemporary 
community standards and whether the work lacks serious artistic or 
political value 
mapplethorpe died of aids in march 1989 at age 42 
the photographs show a man urinating into anothers mouth and 
pictures of objects including a whip inserted into mens anuses 
the child nudity charge is based on two pictures of children one 
of a boy and one of a girl with genitals showing 
prouty repeatedly told jurors that the photos by their mere 
presence could secure a conviction 
obscenity is obscenity he said 
you may have to look at the picture but whats really on 
trial is mr barrie sirkin told jurors robert mapplethorpe is 
not on trial and his lifestyle is not on trial 
in attempting to assess community awareness defense attorneys 
asked prospective jurors how often they visited galleries heard 
concerts and saw movies 
one man said he didnt go to many movies because i dont want 
to put out the 375 
it has been a long time since youve been to a movie sirkin 
responded 
on friday two police officers testified they saw the photos on 
display at the gallery testimony is scheduled to resume monday in 
hamilton county municipal court

the worlds highest aids rates are in africa a 
continent where health officials are illequipped to cope with the 
disease experts at an aids symposium said saturday 
aids comes on top of africas already intolerable burden of 
economic social and health problems said dr nzilambi nzila 
deputy director of a kinshasa zaire aids project 
the countries which have been most affected are the countries 
least able to handle this problem said dr pk kataaha 
presenting a report from ugandan health officials 
some 65000 aids cases have been officially reported in africa 
but the world health organization estimates the true total is 
probably closer to 500000 in some countries such as uganda 
health officials estimate that one person in every five is already 
infected with hiv the virus that causes aids 
in contrast about 150000 cases have been recorded in the 
united states and about one in 200 persons is infected with the 
virus 
kataaha and other researchers spoke at a symposium sponsored by 
the morehouse school of medicine and the federal governments 
research centers in minority institutions program saturday was the 
final day of the symposium 
the african aids epidemic has effects beyond the immediate toll 
of death and sickness said dr alfred j fortin a specialist in 
aids and development issues from the university of hawaii 
aids in africa is just one more reason for those with capital 
to look elsewhere when theyre investing traveling or 
contemplating starting new industries fortin said 
and africa a continent with substandard health care to begin 
with faces major political problems trying to address aids 
concerns he said 
african nations like many third world countries tend to 
place all their eggs in the internationalassistance basket he 
said and there is no active aids constituency there as there is 
in this country 
the disease is sweeping through middle and upperincome people 
in africa robbing countries of laborers technicians and 
government workers they badly need fortin said 
this is having a significant effect on the productive powers 
of those societies he said

the supreme court agreed saturday to 
hear an appeal to halt a plan that reserves nearly half the civil 
service posts for lowcaste hindus the policy has led to a rash of 
protest clashes and suicides 
a panel of five justices are expected to meet monday on an 
application by the supreme court bar association for a temporary 
injunction on the program announced aug 7 by prime minister vp 
singh to counteract centuries of discrimination 
the appeal seeks to suspend the quota program until a nov 6 
hearing on its legality 
meanwhile some members of singhs janata dal party in 
parliament issued a letter accusing him of mishandling the issue 
and demanding his resignation 
leaders of the critics refused to say how many people signed the 
letter but most had previously been aligned with singhs party 
rivals indian news agencies reported 
four uppercaste students committed suicide to protest the 
policy and one person died from gunshot wounds friday when police 
tried to quell riots in hansi about 50 miles northwest of new 
delhi 
thirteen youths have taken their lives the past 10 days some 
burning themselves or taking poison each left a note blaming the 
job policy also 48 people have died by police gunfire in street 
battles 
whitecollar government jobs are highly coveted by graduates in 
india where more than 5 million educated people are unemployed 
according to official figures the government employs about 18 
million people 
kk venugopal president of the bar association said he hoped 
an injunction would stop the wave of suicides a threemember 
supreme court tribunal had earlier declined to intervene in the 
case 
singh has refused to retract or delay the policy to increase the 
lowcaste job quota to 49 percent saying it is necessary to 
reverse centuries of discrimination previously 22 percent of jobs 
were reserved for the lower castes 
indias complex hindu caste system sets social levels according 
to birth ranging from the toplevel brahmins to the sudras who do 
menial tasks below them are the untouchables tradition 
forbids them from wearing shoes riding bicycles or sharing a water 
well with caste hindus 
uppercaste students claim reverse discrimination will deprived 
them of jobs even though they are better qualified some 
psychologists quoted by the press trust of india news agency said 
the dozens of suicide bids suggest mass hysteria 
hoping to ease student anger the government announced a plan to 
create 3 million new jobs in five years in the nation of 880 
million people 
the unrest has also threatened the stability of singhs minority 
national front coalition 
singhs allies have attacked his handling of the demonstrations 
though none has criticized the idea of reserving jobs for deprived 
classes 
senior leaders of singhs party decided at a closed meeting 
friday to leave the governments decision intact news reports 
said 
a test of singhs 10monthold coalition government may come 
early next month when parliament convenes in special session to 
discuss extending federal rule over the state of punjab where sikh 
militants are fighting to leave the indian union 
india which is 82 percent hindu embraced secularism and 
socialist ideals when it became independent from britain in 1947 
it pledged to discard the caste system but the ancient social 
order continues

soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov warned saturday of 
economic disorder spreading through the country and said the potato 
crop must be harvested within three weeks to avoid a hungry winter 
for the masses 
ryzhkov in a nationally televised interview depicted a 
crumbling economy with promised shipments of food medicine and 
other necessities going undelivered and economic warfare being 
waged among cities and regions 
i dont want to dramatize things i dont want to frighten 
anyone i have no right to do that ryzhkov said 
but laws are not obeyed decrees are not obeyed resolutions 
are not obeyed there are massive violations to say nothing of 
criminal violations he said its been a long time since we 
had such a situation in this country 
ryzhkov has been pushing for a more moderate economic reform 
than that endorsed by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who 
has backed a plan to move from central planning to a market system 
in this nation of 290 million residents 
the soviet parliament has been unable to enact a coherent reform 
plan and last week bestowed extraordinary powers on gorbachev to 
direct the economic transition gorbachevs first step was a decree 
threatening fines against suppliers who do not make promised 
deliveries 
that decree and rykhkovs televised warning came amid media 
reports that the harvest was going poorly especially for potatoes 
a staple of the soviet diet 
this week factory workers soldiers and city dwellers swarmed 
to the countryside to help farmers pull potatoes from rainsoaked 
fields in an effort to fend off hunger this winter 
in some industrial regions people are going to the fields 
despite the difficult weather conditions and the army helps 
ryzhkov said 
he referred to a resolution by the council of ministers on 
wednesday aimed at saving the harvest especially vegetables and 
potatoes the situation is very difficult 
asked to evaluate prospects for an adequate food supply this 
winter ryzhkov replied i think now these weeks two or maximum 
three if we work as we should we have reasons to say that we will 
be able to store up potatoes even though the crops are worse this 
year 
he mostly blamed the weather which has been cold and rainy in 
central russia since midaugust 
but he also laid the onus on the collapse of the system of 
economic planning in which the central government orders factories 
and farms what goods to deliver when and where 
as the country prepares to shift to a market economy and 
producers cast about for higher profits those centrally planned 
deliveries are not being made 
what causes great concern and even indignation is the 
discipline of deliveries take meat for example the meat 
situation has sharply worsened said ryzhkov 
he cited the failure of collective farms to deliver meat to 
sverdlovsk a key industrial city in the ural mountains east of 
moscow and a decision by authorities in karelia near finland to 
make scheduled timber deliveries outside that region because 
karelians were not receiving food from elsewhere 
we cannot allow ourselves into a situation where regions wage 
economic war against each other he said 
its like a chain reaction ultimately its bad for 
everyone he said its a single economic organism and it 
ought to work precisely and be wellcoordinated people 
themselves will suffer the question of discipline is coming to the 
fore today

pope john paul ii in a message to the world 
summit for children urged families saturday to respect all human 
life unborn as well as born 
the pontiff also said the vatican supports an international 
treaty on childrens rights as long as programs do not advocate use 
of birth control opposed by the roman catholic church 
the children of the world cry out for greater respect for 
their inalienable individual dignity and for their right to life 
from the first moment of conception even in the face of difficult 
circumstances or personal handicap the pope said in a message to 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
reiterating the churchs opposition to abortion john paul said 
children should be raised in families where there is profound 
respect for all human life unborn as well as born and where both 
mother and father jointly make responsbile decisions regarding the 
exercise of their parenthood 
a text of the popes message was released by the vatican 
the twoday summit at the united nations is aimed at mobilizing 
governments to protect up to 100 million children from death by 
disease and malnutrition in the 1990s 
the pope praised the convention on the rights of the child 
which went into effect this month and requires ratifying nations to 
guarantee the survival of children and their development 
in a reference to birth control john paul stressed the vatican 
endorsed the convention on the understanding that future programs 
and actions will respect the moral convictions of parents 
regarding the transmission of life with no urging to resort to 
means which are morally unacceptable

cardinal bernard yago said saturday 
a plot to assassinate pope john paul ii was uncovered prior to a 
papal visit earlier this month but denied ivory coast opposition 
parties were involved 
the cardinal attributed the plot to a group based in ghana and 
condemned president felix houphouetboigny for disclosing details 
about the plot 
he should have kept it secret he has held political 
interests above those of the roman catholic church the 
cardinal said in rare criticism of ivory coasts leader of 30 
years 
the cardinal noted houphouetboigny accusations came as the 
president faced the nations first multiparty elections on oct 28 
the 85yearold president did not name those he claimed were 
responsible for hiring mercenaries and former soldiers to kill john 
paul when he visited ivory coast on sept 910 no attack was made 
on the pontiff 
yago said one assassination plotter had confessed to a parish 
priest and said he was disgusted by houphouetboignys 
political use of knowledge that came from the confessional 
emile boga a leader of the opposition ivorian popular front 
called the assassination plot allegations a fabrication 
the cardinal said the pontiff had been told about the plot 
before the visit 
earlier chief vatican spokesman joaquin navarro asked about 
houphouetboignys claim said we never comment on such 
matters

in a major step toward normalizing relations 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has given the green light for 
direct flights between the soviet union and israel a senior 
israeli official said saturday 
the flights will begin within a month said yossi ahimeir a 
spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir he said the soviets 
did not provide further details about the arrangement which by 
late saturday had not been reported by soviet media 
the flights would accelerate the exodus of jews from the soviet 
union to israel the jewish state is already straining to 
accommodate more than 100000 newcomers who have arrived since last 
year 
a senior israeli immigration official however said the number 
of direct flights would initially be limited to about two per week 
each way and thus would not immediately have a dramatic effect on 
the numbers of soviet immigrants 
but hopefully the number of flights will eventually be 
expanded said the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
we would like to be in a position in which the majority of soviet 
jews can come straight from the soviet union its easier and 
safer 
the immigrants now arrive via european transit points and space 
is often limited even before the direct flights agreement was 
announced estimates said the number of soviet jewish immigrants 
could swell to 1 million by the end of 1992 
ahimeir praised the soviet step as a very positive development 
in the direction of strengthening and intensifying the relations 
between israel and the soviet union 
he said it was another leap toward resuming diplomatic ties 
the soviets themselves have told us that after such a period of 
improved relations it is very possible that there will be 
diplomatic relations he told the associated press 
the soviet union cut ties with israel after it captured 
territory of moscows arab allies in the 1967 middle east war 
relations have warmed the past three years in part because 
israel is seen by the soviets as a conduit for western investment 
and because moscow wants to play a role in middle eastern 
diplomacy 
the soviet decision to allow direct flights was passed on by 
soviet finance minister valentin pavlov to israeli transportation 
minister moshe katzav in a telephone call on friday the eve of yom 
kippur the jewish day of atonement israel radio reported 
the national airlines of the two countries aeroflot and el al 
signed a direct flights agreement last year but aeroflot then said 
it needed approval from soviet leaders before flights could being 
gorbachev held up the deal because he didnt want to anger arab 
states protesting the immigration of soviet jews to israel arab 
fears heightened after shamir suggested in january that israel 
needs to hold on to the occupied west bank and gaza strip to house 
the newcomers 
in april israelis rejected a soviet offer of direct flights in 
exchange for a promise not to settle soviet jews in the occupied 
lands israel maintains it cannot tell immigrants where to live 
it seems they the soviets are now softening their 
position ahimeir said 
the apparent soviet concession comes at a time when the arab 
world is busy with the persian gulf crisis

the state department on saturday issued a new 
warning to americans traveling abroad of the threat of 
iraqsponsored terrorist attacks in the near future 
the state department is particularly concerned about possible 
terrorist attacks in europe and the middle east the advisory 
said 
like an initial warning issued sept 7 the new announcement did 
not cite specific locations that may be targeted by terrorist 
forces loyal to iraqi leader saddam hussein 
however it said evidence continues to accumulate that 
iraqisponsored terrorism may occur in the near future 
the department said for the first time that its evidence points 
to europe and the middle east as the likeliest areas for terrorist 
attack 
while information does not suggest that americans traveling 
abroad are the specific targets of possible iraqisponsored 
terrorism the advisory said americans overseas should 
exercise caution particularly when in or near us milttary or 
civilian facilities or at other facilities commonly identified as 
american 
national security adviser brent scowcroft told reporters in a 
briefing friday that saddam was actively discussing things with 
terrorist leaders 
asked if there was evidence of specific threats scowcroft said 
there have been a couple of strange incidents in brussels for 
example and there was a recent one there was a soldier shot i 
think and wounded in saudi arabia 
last week assailants broke into the brussels home of a us air 
force general assigned to nato and belgian reports called the 
incident an attempted kidnapping or murder the general was out of 
the country at the time 
and an air force mechanic suffered a gunshot wound to the 
shoulder thursday at a facility in saudi arabia the air force said 
it was unable to determine whether the shooting was a terrorist 
act 
what we do have are some indications that saddam hussein is 
actively discussing things with leaders of certain terrorist 
organizations and it was for that reason that we gave him an 
explicit warning that we would consider terrorist activities as 
coming from him and hold him personally responsible scowcroft 
said 
france warned saturday it would retaliate if it finds iraq was 
even indirectly behind a grenade attack that killed a french child 
and injured 17 other people thursday night in djibouti 
on thursday assailants hurled grenades into a crowded cafe 
popular with french soldiers stationed in the red sea nation 
the state departments original advisory was released about a 
month after the united states began the massive deployment of 
forces to the persian gulf region in response to iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait

united auto workers union members appeared to be 
giving overwhelming approval to a new threeyear contract with 
general motors corp as voting wound down saturday 
voting on the new pact concludes sunday union officials said 
they will not release final totals until later this week but 
checks at more than half of the 155 union locals at gm facilities 
revealed large ratification margins 
i felt that it was wellreceived uaw local 696 president 
joseph hasenjager said saturday the day after 83 percent of voting 
members in his 3200member local at dayton ohio approved the 
contract 
other locals approving the contract late last week included 
local 1618 at the reatta craft centre in lansing mich with 94 
percent in favor local 662 in anderson ind with 90 percent 
support and local 653 in pontiac mich with 88 percent favoring 
the pact 
meanwhile in toronto canadian auto workers union spokeswoman 
peggy nash said her unions talks with general motors of canada 
ltd continued this weekend on local issues 
she said the first meeting of top negotiating committees from 
both sides is scheduled for later this week the union which is 
basing its demands on a contract it reached with ford of canada 
earlier this month has set an oct 10 deadline for talks with gms 
canadian subsidiary 
in the united states the uaw hopes to pattern agreements with 
ford motor co and chrysler corp with the contract it reached with 
gm on sept 17 after the ballots on the uawgm contract are 
counted the union will begin intensive bargaining with either ford 
or chrysler corp 
uaw contracts with each of the big three expired at midnight 
sept 14 
provisions of agreements covering more than 450000 active 
workers were continued while bargaining and ratification voting 
went on gm employs about 300000 of the unions members ford has 
about 106000 and chrysler has about 60000 
its expected that ford the nations secondlargest automaker 
behind gm will have little problem coming to terms with the uaw 
over a contract similar to gms 
theres a much more ominous tone to the uawchrysler talks 
the union repeatedly has said it will not settle for a contract 
with chrysler outside of the pattern set with the other automakers 
and chrysler has said just as often it needs to cut its labor 
costs especially in health care 
the gmuaw contract provides for no change in the healthcare 
system offered to employees 
maintenance of health care provisions negotiated in 1987 and 
improvements in the pension plan were two of the big sellers of the 
1990 contract hasenjager said 
other selling points included a gm promise to pay up to 4 
billion to guarantee wages for workers laid off mre than 36 weeks 
during the next three years 
in addition the contract provides for a 3 percent raise in the 
first year and lump sum payments in the second and third years of 3 
percent cost of living adjustments were retained

the senate on saturday approved a proposal 
that would outlaw most abortions in poland for the first time in 34 
years while setting jail terms for doctors who perform them 
the bill passed 5017 with five abstentions it must next be 
considered by the sejm parliaments lower chamber 
the bill would allow abortions only when a womans life is in 
danger or when pregnancy is a result of a crime the senators 
rejected a provision to establish jail terms for woman who have 
abortions 
feminist groups from around the country protested vociferously 
during the twoday senate debate abortion has been legal since 
1956 when communist authorities made the decision without public 
debate 
poland is about 90 percent roman catholic but it has one of the 
worlds highest abortion rates 
more than 500 people mostly young women marched outside the 
parliament building saturday carrying banners and throwing leaflets 
criticizing the legislation 
dont let a small group of men decide about the life of 
women one female demonstrator called over a loudspeaker the 
100member senate has seven women 
sen edward wende who spoke with a fivemember delegation of 
protesters said the proposal was still far from becoming law 
this is only the beginning of the legislative process we all 
agree in principle that the mother should not be punished said 
wende this is parliament and further discussion will be held 
here about the final shape of this law 
in may 1989 the sejm proposed a more punitive bill that would 
have penalized both doctors and the women who undergo abortions 
action on the bill was delayed but the senate decision throws the 
matter back into the sejm 
as poland and other east bloc nations move toward democracy 
issues such as abortion and religious education in schools have 
emerged 
in some areas of czechoslovakia groups have pushed to restrict 
relatively easy access to abortion roman catholic church leaders 
in hungary also are campaigning to restrict abortions 
in romania on the other hand nearly 500000 women have had 
abortions since a ban by the late president nicolae ceausescu was 
lifted when he was deposed in december 
although the vast majority of poles consider themselves roman 
catholic many young couples turn to abortion when they are unable 
to find larger apartments in the housingstarved nation reliable 
contraceptives are infrequently available in poland

he said this meant building up reserve stocks for 30 days 
delivery of ammunition and other fresh supplies would be a top 
priority even in a brief conflict between iraq and the united 
states and its allies 
pagonis the commander of the us army support command arrived 
here aug 3 a day after iraq seized kuwait he said he had to use 
a rented chevrolet as his office at first and slept one night in 
the back seat 
us forces have the supply edge over baghdad despite having to 
import huge amounts of material from the united states pagonis 
said 
iraq would have an enormous problem in maintaining its 
supply lines over limited road access with a limited number of 
trucks that can only carry so much cargo 
my line of communication is from the port to the soldiers 
thats peanuts compared to his 
iraqs supply problems are sure to grow worse as a result of 
un economic sanctions he said 
pagonis said the first sea delivery of supplies was completed 
within 30 days and that eight fast sealift ships that brought the 
first loads of armor and other major equipment now are on the way 
with more 
weve delivered more soldiers and discharged more ships in a 
short period of time than any armed forces in the world the 
general said 
pagonis said logistical troops now arriving would be able to 
take up the slack should an outbreak of hostilities send the 
thousands of drivers and other civilian contract workers now 
employed by the americans fleeing for safety 
many of the workers are third country foreigners who have no 
families in saudi arabia and would probably remain with the us 
troops in the event of war he said 
the general estimated overall costs of uscontracted services 
at 380 million a month 
the saudis are providing free water fuel and most of the food 
for us troops other than field rations he said

lebanese president elias hrawi held five 
hours of talks saturday with president hafez assad and received 
syrias support for the measures he is taking against a rebel 
christian leader officials said 
hrawis army closed all crossing points into east beirut enclave 
of gen michel aoun on friday in a bid to starve him into 
submission 
it was not clear whether hrawi had asked for military support 
although it is generally understood that syria is willing to 
provide military assistance if hrawi asked 
president assad expressed syrias full support to the moves 
taken by the lebanese legitimacy to extend its authority and 
expressed syrias readiness to provide every assistance to achieve 
this purpose presidential spokesman jibrane kourieh said 
hrawis move friday tightened an economic blockade that his 
government imposed july 30 against aoun and his 15000 soldiers 
who control an area of 80 square miles in east beirut and the 
neighboring metn mountains 
troops stopped all supplies of flour food and vegetables from 
entering the zone friday fuel supplies and money transfers had 
been banned for two months 
hrawi and aoun are both maronite catholics the sect that has 
dominated government structures in lebanon since independence from 
france in 1943 
hrawi was elected last fall within the framework of a peace plan 
brokered by the arab league to resolve lebanons 15yearold civil 
war between moslems and christians 
aoun rejected the plan because it did not include a timetable 
for the withdrawal of syrian troops in lebanon since 1976

lockheed corps prototype 
of a 21st century fighter jet made its first flight saturday in a 
winnertakeall competition for the multibilliondollar advanced 
tactical fighter contract 
the yf22 was airborne just 18 minutes taking off from air 
force plant 42 in palmdale and ending 25 mile away at this desert 
flight test center 
the flight was a milestone in a highstakes contest between an 
aerospace team headed by lockheed and a team led by northrop corp 
for 1250 atf jets to be built at a projected cost of 51 million 
per plane 
the winner must produce a jet that is highly maneuverable uses 
radarevading stealth technology and can fly twice the speed of 
sound for long periods of time the air force wants 750 of the new 
planes and the navy needs 500 
pilot dave ferguson said the yf22 flew as expected although the 
flight was shortened by 42 minutes because of problems at ground 
telemetry stations 
the jet burned so much fuel while sitting on the runway waiting 
for takeoff that there wasnt enough left for the scheduled 
onehour flight 
it was a very easy airplane to fly said ferguson adding 
i would be happy to put fuel in it and fly it this afternoon 
the jet reached an altitude of 12500 feet and a speed of about 
280 mph the twotone gray jet with stubby wings and a vshaped 
tail touched down smoothly in a light rain 
the yf22 was built by lockheed general dynamics corp and 
boeing co it was unveiled in palmdale aug 29 two days after the 
yf23 built by northrop corp and mcdonnell douglas corp made 
its first flight 
lockheed vice president sherman mullin head of the yf22 
project said he could not compare the two planes because he didnt 
have enough information about the yf23 
each team has spent about 600 million producing two prototype 
jets each 
its obviously an extremely important program to us said 
mullin but its not a program thats going to make or break 
the lockheed corp 
both planes are built of advanced composite materials the 
lockheed aircraft has stubby wings the northrop fighter has a 
longer cigarlike fuselage and a wingspread that looks like a kite 
this is a great day from a technological perspective said 
gary l denman who heads an air force research division i can 
assure you whats out there in the airplane is the best in the 
world 
survival of the advanced fighter program was threatened by 
congress until iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait the crisis has 
enhanced prospects for approval of major defense contracts 
if northrop and mcdonnell douglas win the contract the yf23 
would be built in california the lockheedgeneral dynamicsboeing 
team plans to build yf22s in marietta ga if it wins the 
selection is due in 1991 
the 51 million cost of each jet is about twice that of the air 
forces present top fighter the f15 eagle

many city officials agree with the students 
who forced the university of the district of columbia to close 
because of their frustration with the mayoral appointees running 
the school a university trustee said saturday 
the protestors seized of a number of university offices 
wednesday because they believe the schools programs are being run 
by a board of trustees made up of pals of mayor marion barry rather 
than by educators alonza evans said 
they wanted to know why they didnt have big name trustees who 
could bring in millions of dollars in donations rather than 
just some of barrys political cronies he told reporters 
before returning to closeddoor negotiations among students 
administrators and trustees 
trustees at udc a public institution with about 12000 
students are nominated by the mayor and confirmed by the council 
members they cannot be forced to resign 
the students have demanded a number of academic improvements in 
return for leaving one of the campus main buildings so classes can 
resume they also asked the 11 mayoral appointees to the 15member 
board to resign immediately a demand that was rejected friday 
at least three city council members have said they also would 
like board members to resign council members plan to call a 
hearing soon to devise a new way of appointing board members 
councilman james nathanson said 
we have been very dissatisfied with performance of the board 
we are looking for a way to restructure the board nathanson said 
last week 
the trustees admit the school which has had five presidents or 
acting presidents in the last eight years is in trouble and have 
offered to make changes stanley said 
regardless of the outcome of talks classes will resume monday 
according to trustee a knighton stanley 
the students say otherwise 
school will remain closed until this matter is ended 
student leader mark thompson said before talks began saturday 
honestly right now we dont anticipate an end by monday 
he also said the students will not compromise on their 
insistence that the board members resign 
that stand could backfire on the students said evans a 1978 
alumnus who was appointed by the schools alumni organization not 
the mayor 
i have been saying for four days that the students have 
legitimate concerns he said but we are prepared to resume 
classes monday 
the protest led trustee nira long to resign as the boards 
chairwoman effective oct 16 and that was a significant victory 
he said 
students have complained that school officials have threatened 
to remove them forcibly if they are not out by monday

iraqs foreign minister made a surprise appearance in jordan on 
saturday giving rise to speculation that saddam hussein might be 
seeking to circumvent the economic embargo or open new diplomatic 
maneuvers 
president bush meanwhile sought to solidify the international 
condemnation of iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait in a series of 
meetings with other world leaders in new york beginning saturday 
in the gulf region the multinational force took on a more 
multinational character britain launched a deployment that was to 
include thousands of ground troops egyptian reinforcements were on 
their way and the first french foreign legionnaires arrived in 
saudi arabia 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said saturday the 
soviet union also would be willing to send troops into military 
action in the persian gulf if it is sanctioned by the united 
nations 
we will comply with any decision with any resolution of the 
security council and that would include anything regarding 
the involvement of the soviet troops under the flag under the 
auspices of the united nations he said in a taped interview for 
broadcast sunday on nbc news meet the press 
france warned saturday it would retaliate if it turns out iraq 
was behind a grenade attack that killed a french child and injured 
17 people thursday night in djibouti the small red sea country 
provides support bases for french forces deployed in the gulf 
region 
if iraq is found responsible foreign minister roland dumas 
said there will be a response from france and you better 
believe it it will be appropriate to the hateful nature of this 
attack 
belgian foreign minister mark eyskens said saturday most 
european community embassies in kuwait city including belgiums 
will probably close next week because the situation is becoming 
unbearable the iraqis have cut off water and energy supplies to 
the embassies 
at the same time iraq backed off a threat to deprive nonarab 
foreigners of food under new rationing beginning monday the threat 
came last week in a foreign ministry memorandum sent to nonarab 
embassies western diplomats said 
the official iraqi news agency quoted trade and finance minister 
mohammed mehdi saleh as saying saturday that rationed food would be 
provided equally to all and calling earlier reports part of a 
rabid campaign against iraq 
an estimated 650000 foreigners remain in iraq and kuwait of 
the more than 2 million there before the invasion 
it was the second time in two weeks iraq made a drastic threat 
against foreigners and then rescinded it 
last week baghdad told western diplomats that harboring 
foreigners was a crime punishable by death a threat western 
governments interpreted as directed at their envoys a day later 
iraqi officials said the decree applied only to iraqi citizens 
in an interview over belgian tv from new york where he was 
attending the un general assembly eyskens said water and 
electricity to the belgian embassy were cut food has practically 
run out and psychological pressure is enormous with iraqi troops 
ringing the embassy 
eyskens said britain may continue to hold out but almost all 
other ec countries probably will close their embassies too the 
us embassy still defies iraqi closure demands 
bush was in new york to attend the world summit for children at 
the united nations but the gulf crisis was high on his agenda 
he set weekend and monday meetings with leaders including 
shevardnadze and prime ministers margaret thatcher of britain and 
toshiki kaifu of japan on monday bush was to make a major speech 
on the gulf to the general assembly 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz visited amman on saturday 
meeting with king hussein and then returning to baghdad 
jordan was a principal trading partner of iraq before the 
invasion and even after the united nations approved the trade 
embargo some supplies continued to flow through jordan 
iraq imported threequarters of its food before the sanctions 
started it imposed rationing of some staples as a result of the 
embargo new nationwide rationing on monday is to cover rice 
flour sugar tea and cooking oil 
jordan has been battered economically by the sanctions and 
agreed only reluctantly to abide by them it was not known whether 
aziz specifically sought a loosening of the embargo in saturdays 
talks but baghdad is believed to have made similar overtures to 
iran with which it recently patched up relations 
jordans difficult position was underlined saturday when the 
king postponed for 48 days convening of the regular session of 
parliament which had been set for monday 
the monarch gave no reason but some lawmakers saw it as an 
attempt to muzzle strong proiraqi sentiment in the legislature 
although jordan condemned the iraqi invasion it has spoken out 
strongly against the usled foreign military deployment in the 
region 
the us contingent stood almost alone early in the crisis but 
allies have been contributing larger and larger shares of troops 
and equipment 
the first deserthardened units of the french foreign legion 
arrived saturday in saudi arabia joining the largest deployment of 
french forces overseas since algerias 195462 war of independence 
the bulk of french ground forces 4000 troops are expected to 
arrive sunday 
france will have about 13000 troops in and around saudi arabia 
when the deployment is completed 
a monthlong british deployment of up to 9000 ground forces was 
under way british officials said the logistical landing ship sir 
tristram sailed friday night from england and hundreds of troops 
left by air from bases in england and germany 
egyptian military sources said saturday about 1000 egyptian 
soldiers had left the port of alexandria for saudi arabia gen 
mohammed ali bilal commander of egyptian forces in saudi arabia 
said he expected the number of his troops in the kingdom to reach 
20000 within the next 15 days 
the united states has sent about 165000 soldiers to the gulf 
region most of them in saudi arabia the pentagon said iraq had 
boosted its forces to 430000 in and around kuwait 
in other developments saturday 
maj gen william g pagonis commander of us military 
logistics in saudi arabia said the supply flow was on schedule and 
could sustain us forces for more than a month in an allout war 
with iraq he called his supply problems peanuts compared to 
those facing iraq 
the indian passenger ship akbar moved out of iraqi waters with 
1700 indian refugees as the tipu sultan approached the southern 
gulf port of dubai with 700 others the alsafeer also indian 
brought out 725 refugees earlier this month 
iranian and iraqi newspapers carried editorials warning of a 
flood of refugees in case war broke out and cautioning moscow not 
to play into washingtons hands 
the englishlanguage baghdad observer said it is paramount 
that moscow should not miss the historic opportunity of playing a 
positive role which it can do without risking its fundamental 
economic political and financial interests

the government is suing lockheed corp over 
its mandatory retirement age for test pilots 
the lawsuit filed friday by the equal employent opportunity 
commission seeks to allow kenneth wier 59 to keep his job as a 
chief test pilot past his birthday on oct 20 lockheed requires 
mandatory retirement at age 60 
lockheed has warned wier he will face retirement if he does not 
give up his pilots job and accept a ground position by monday 
the suit filed in us district court seeks to overturn the age 
limit plus back pay and possible reinstatement for test pilots 
forced to retire under the policy 
us district judge terry hatter jr denied an eeoc motion to 
temporarily block the retirement policy while the suit is pending 
lockheed officials expressed surprise at the federal agencys 
action 
we dont know why they decided to do this now with this 
pilot company spokesman jim ragsdale said 
lockheed says its retirement policy is based on commercial 
airline policy which also mandates retirement at age 60 
the physical and psychological demands on lockheed pilots are 
significantly greater than those placed on pilots in commercial 
aviation lockheed lawyers argued in court documents certainly 
no lesser standard can be applied 
wier of santa ana is currently chief test pilot for the u2 and 
tr1 reconnaissance plane programs a job he has held for 18 years 
ragsdale said 
wiers record is excellent and his performance has shown no 
deterioration in the past few years ragsdale said 
court documents say wier has flown more than 235 types of planes 
in his 35 years as a pilot he has flown for lockheed for 24 years

a special senate counsel recommended more than 
two weeks ago that the ethics committee clear two of the five 
senators under investigation for their ties to savings and loan 
operator charles h keating jr sources confirmed saturday 
the confidential sept 10 report of robert s bennett said there 
was inadequate evidence to pursue the case against sens john 
glenn dohio and john mccain rariz but advised the panel to 
look further in the case of the three others democratic sens 
donald w riegle jr of michigan dennis deconcini of arizona and 
alan cranston of california the sources said 
neither bennett nor any of the six members of the ethics panel 
led by chairman howell heflin dala would comment on the 
disclosure originally made late friday about the special 
counsels recommendations or why the committee has yet to act upon 
them despite three interim meetings 
and none of the senators targeted by the probe said he had any 
formal word about bennetts findings though mccains spokesman 
scott celley said we presume its true since theres been no 
denial the senator is pleased to hear this and hopes the 
ethics committee will vote these recommendations soon certainly he 
hopes it will have acted before the election there is an old 
saying justice delayed is justice denied 
none of the five is up for reelection this year but some 
sources talking on condition of anonymity said they believed 
heflin and other members of the ethics panel are reluctant to take 
any definitive action in the heated political atmosphere 
particularly at a time when the senate is burdened with crucial 
floor business over the budget and other issues 
i wouldnt look for a thing until after election day said 
one aide close to the case believe me a lot of senators on both 
sides of the aisle feel that way i cant count the number of them 
who have told me there but for the grace of god go i and want 
to move the issue off center stage 
if glenn and mccain were cleared republicans could point to the 
fact that those remaining under scrutiny in congress are all 
democrats and some gop aides suggested that may have something to 
do with the delay but republicans still would have no monopoly on 
fingerpointing in the s amp l debacle with president bushs son 
neil facing serious allegations over his dealings in a colorado 
case 
and conservative republican sen jesse helms rnc an ethic 
committee member and close political ally of mccain said earlier 
in the week the committee is moving as fast as it can do you 
suggest we dont work every angle he asked we just have a 
heavy load 
all five senators subject to the investigation have acknowledged 
intervening with banking regulators on behalf of keating but say 
they did so in a proper manner consistent with their duties toward 
any constituent seeking help collectively they received 13 
million in campaign contributions from keating and his associates 
the three senators who under bennetts recommendation would 
remain under investigation declined direct comment on that 
prospect riegles spokeswoman karolyn wallace said the 
committee is in stage one of a possible threestage process 
senator riegle is confident its review will find his conduct to 
have been proper 
keating controlled lincoln savings and loan of irvine calif 
whose failure has been estimated to cost the taxpayers 2 billion 
his family is from ohio he had a hotel project in michigan and his 
principal corporation operated in arizona where his enterprises 
once pumped an estimated 100 million annually into the economy and 
had a payroll of 50000 
keating charged with fraud in the sale of more than 200 
million in risky junk bonds is in jail in los angeles unable to

an awardwinning spanish director whose 
latest film received an x rating in the united states said he hopes 
a change in classifying adultoriented movies will bring his work 
to a wider american audience 
im very pleased because this means there will be a new market 
for the film pedro almodovar told el pais newspaper in a story 
published saturday 
tie me up tie me down the 38yearold directors seventh 
feature film was rated x earlier this year by the motion picture 
association of america because of the movies explicit sexual 
scenes the film tells the story of a former mental patient who 
kidnaps a pornographic film star and exdrug addict who eventually 
falls in love with him 
almodovar and the films distributor miramax films sued in may 
to get the films rating changed to r which prohibits minors 
unless accompanied by a parent the film was finally distributed 
without a rating 
many us movie houses shied away from xrated films because of 
the perceived link to hardcore sexual films which often use the x 
rating in advertisements the x rating the only category not 
copyrighted by the film association prohibits viewers under 18 
years old 
the x rating was eliminated wednesday in favor of a new nc17 
the r rating remains intact as does the pg13 pg and g ratings 
the first beneficiary of the new rating system is philip 
kaufmans formerly xrated film on the life of author henry miller 
henry and june from universal pictures scheduled for release 
oct 5 
we all feel that universals protest over the rating of 
kaufmans film was the determining factor said film producer 
agustin almodovar the directors brother 
agustin almodovar said he and his brother would seek a new 
rating for tie me up tie me down 
the new rating would open the possibility of showing the film 
in at least 100 theaters of the most conservative states where it 
was refused because it had no rating 
pedro almodovars women on the verge of a nervous breakdown 
has grossed nearly 30 million in worldwide sales and is the 
biggest box office hit in spanish history actress jane fonda has 
bought the rights for a us production 
almodovar who worked for the telephone company in central spain 
before getting involved in underground productions has based many 
of his films on confusion over sexual roles unrequitted love and 
the hassles of life in modern spain 
he said recently he would like to change the tenor of his work 
and has purchased the rights to time for friendship a short 
story set in north africa by american author paul bowles 
the director added that he felt the movie associations 
decisions seemed biased against foreign films 
another miramaxdistributed film british director peter 
greenaways the cook the thief his wife and her lover also 
was rated x 
i dont think i would be overly modest in saying that it was 
we europeans or my brother and i if you like who put our necks on 
the line for a principle he said 
other xrated films of high artistic quality have included 
1969s midnight cowboy 1973s last tango in paris 1969s 
if and 1971s a clockwork orange 
there is no rating system for films in spain which emerged 14 
years ago from the rigid censorship of the 36year dictatorship of 
gen francisco franco 
spanish state television features striptease acts on prime time 
shows and two of the three new private tv channels compete for 
audience with parades of topless and sometimes bottomless young

improve scores evidence of doctoring was found on 53 of 62 tests

minimum amounts of goods when they leave the country on trips this 
winter 
the government also barred romanians and foreign travelers from 
taking more than a days supply of food across borders from oct 1 
through april 30

romanian goods across the border which is squeezing the romanian 
market which is so poor anyway government spokesman adrian 
sirbu said 
romanians seeking foreign currency or scarce foods like meat and 
sugar are selling items such as carpets clothing and tents in 
turkey hungary and bulgaria 
the government also restricted imports of foreign cars sirbu 
said romanians were buying secondhand gas guzzlers in austria 
west germany and holland 
most of these western cars have powerful engines so they eat 
more gasoline sirbu said gasoline is also scarce in romania

india and pakistan are trading ever 
harsher accusations before the un general assembly even as other 
speakers welcome the easing of tension and rivalries in some other 
parts of the world 
in speeches friday pakistans foreign minister sahabzada yaqub 
khan accused india of reneging on a 40yearold pledge of 
selfdetermination for the kashmir he urged the international 
community to exert its moral and political influence to support 
the struggle of the people of kashmir 
external affairs minister inder kumar gujral of india charged in 
his speech that pakistan armed and assisted terrorists for more 
than eight years in the indian punjab recently pakistan has 
chosen to extend these practices to the northern territory of 
kashmir he said where thousands have died since indian military 
forces began a crackdown in midjanuary 
gujral said pakistan characteristically denied responsibility 
and involvement in these acts and now tries to justify them on 
the pretext of support to religious fundamentalism in violation 
of international law and good neighborliness 
yaqub khan described the upheaval in kashmir as a spontaneous 
uprising that 300000 indian security forces people are trying to 
crush 
the two countries have twice gone to war over the kashmir in 
194748 and in 1965 the wars have left kashmir divided into 
pakistani and indian sectors 
both foreign ministers accused the other of rejecting proposals 
for resolving their disputes and building confidence 
yaqub khan said that at two highlevel meetings in july and 
august the indian side evaded the core issues namely discussion 
of the kashmir dispute and redeployment of forces to peacetime 
locations in the region 
gujral said india and pakistan can have a great future if we 
respect each others integrity and unity and once pakistan desists 
from the temptation of interfering in our internal affairs 
he said that in that spirit i will not refer to the gross 
flouting of human rights in pakistan and the dismissal of prime 
minister benazir bhutto 
that is pakistans internal matter even though democrats 
everywhere feel concerned he said 
ms bhutto elected in 1988 was thrown out of office by 
president ghulam ishaq khan last month sunday she was to appear 
before a court that will decide whether she can participate in 
politics in the future

west germanys highest court ruled in favor 
of east germanys former communists on saturday and threw out a 
plan for holding united german elections on dec 2 
the federal constitutional court said the election format would 
deny small parties a fair chance at power in the united germany 
that will be created on wednesday 
although the ruling will not halt the historic merger it is a 
victory for the nowreformed communists who once ruled east germany 
and increases the chances they will win seats in a ew parliament 
the decision also will force lawmakers to scramble this week to 
come up with an alternative election plan and avoid postponing the 
first united german elections in 60 years 
meanwhile the top lawman in west berlin warned of an alarming 
security situation in east berlin where leftist radicals have 
been reported to be planning riots to protest germany unity 
west berlin interior minister erich paetzold in a letter to 
police officials in both berlins called on officers to work 
together next week to contain violence as their departments merge 
about 5000 people marched saturday from west berlin to east 
berlin to protest what they called the annexation of east 
germany by west germany 
the protest was called by a womens group demanding greater 
rights in a united germany 
although it is popularly called german unification in fact east 
germany is essentially dissolving itself and acceding to the larger 
nation whose laws will supplant east germanys 
east germany braced for growing unrest in its final days as a 
nation 
inmates seized prison rooftops in dresden buetzow and leipzig 
on saturday to protest a prisoner amnesty plan that would exempt 
those convicted of violent crimes many claim they were falsely 
imprisoned under the communists 
in east berlin authorities made 15 arrests after hundreds of 
young people rampaged friday night through the citys main square 
alexanderplatz following a soccer match east berlin has become 
increasingly violent since borders to the west were opened 
west german chancellor helmut kohl will be in charge of a united 
germany after wednesday 
kohl plans to add four east germans to his cabinet west 
germanys parliament also will add 144 lawmakers chosen late friday 
from the 400member east german parliament 
among those east german lawmakers are 24 members of the reformed 
communists who are the thirdlargest party in east germany but 
would be only a small political voice in a greater germany 
west german government spokesman dieter vogel said he hoped the 
combined parliament this week would come up with a new election 
plan quickly enough to still hold elections on dec 2 
the constitutional courts decision was based on a complaint 
brought by the former communists the environmental greens 
coalition and the farright republicans 
hans christian stroebele spokesman for the greens hailed the 
decision as sweet success against the arrogance of the cocky 
dominant parties 
the rejected election plan was the result of a compromise in 
august between the conservative christian democrats the top party 
in both german lands and the main opposition the leftleaning 
social democrats 
under the election plan parties would need to win 5 percent of 
the vote across a united germany to get a seat in parliament 
the election treaty also would have allowed smaller parties to 
form alliances with larger parties and share ballots allowing 
small parties to get the necessary 5 percent 
but the former communists and the rightist republicans have 
virtually no chance of winning 5 percent of the total german vote 
nor of finding mainstream parties willing to share a ballot 
ernst gottfried mahrenholz vice president of the constitutional 
court said it was unfair to require small east german parties to 
get 5 percent of the vote nationwide 
the court also struck down the mechanism that would allow 
smaller parties to be listed with larger allied parties 
the social democrats wanted the 5 percent limit to keep small 
leftleaning parties from getting in parliament and diluting the 
social democrats clout in a united germany 
the chrstian democrats wanted the agreement that would allow 
bigger parties to form alliances with smaller parties because 
kohls power base is comprised of coalitions with other 
conservative and centrist parties

a united way chapter fearing a fundraising 
backlash reversed its decision to cut funding to a boy scouts 
group because of protests from atheists over the scout oath 
officials said saturday 
atheists blasted the decision and said theyd continue the 
fight they oppose a scouts oath to do his duty to god and my 
country 
the genoakingston united way chapter reversed itself by an 81 
vote late friday and will resume its 1250 contribution to the boy 
scouts of americatwo rivers council 
there was an overwhelming response from our donor base that 
they wanted the boy scouts funded united way board chairman jim 
ferris said at a news conference there was some concern that our 
ability to collect may be hurt by the previous board decision 
robert sherman a spokesman for the northern illinois chapter of 
american atheists inc based in austin texas said the united way 
group violated its promise not to support an organization that 
practices religious discrimination they are soliciting money 
from atheists and others under a promise that these funds would be 
used for human care services without discrimination sherman said 
at a news conference 
there is an impression that society will tolerate the 
violation of atheists rights he said 
the genoakingston united way group based about 60 miles 
northwest of chicago voted to halt the boy scout funding aug 29 
the boy scout council is based in the small north chicago suburb of 
st charles 
a pending federal lawsuit filed in chicago challenges the 
requirement that boy scouts take the oath 
the charge of discrimination that the atheists are raising is 
in the courts right now for a decision united way of america 
spokesman tony de christofaro said in an interview from alexander 
va 
that is why local officials reinstated the allocation he 
said 
the boy scouts receive more than 80 million a year from united 
way agencies across the country christofaro said 
the local chapters original decision to withhold 1991 funding 
made it the first of 1400 united way groups nationwide to take 
such action 
the atheists group will ask the illinois attorney general to 
investigate the united way chapter sherman said 
atheists also hope to block any future united way grants to the 
scouts with legal action and plan a federal lawsuit seeking to 
revoke the boy scouts national charter granted by congress he 
said

china sold iraq large quantities of a rare 
chemical used to make missile fuel poison gas and possibly 
nuclear weapons in violation of the un trade embargo a 
newspaper reported 
the independent in its sunday editions said it had documents 
showing that around sept 20 a subsidiary of north china 
industries corp agreed to supply about seven tons of lithium 
hydride to iraq for about 15 million 
the deal was struck in great secrecy the newspaper said 
britains foreign office said it was studying the report 
china a permanent member of the un security council voted 
for a resolution banning trade with iraq following its aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
the independent reported the us embassy in beijing told the 
chinese foreign ministry it was concerned about the activities of 
the chinese firm known as norinco it was not known if the 
embassys statement was related to the lithium hydride deal it 
said 
iraqi president saddam hussein has previously tried to obtain 
lithium hydride but the three western manufacturers of the 
chemical are suspicious of large orders the chemical is used in 
minute quantities in the pharmaceutical and computer industries 
the newspaper said 
just before the un trade embargo vote the norinco subsidiary 
sent sales material about lithium hydride to five international 
arms dealers the newspaper said 
the company offered 10 tons of the chemical at about 210000 a 
ton the offer was open to any purchaser and iraq agreed to buy 
seven tons 
sources suspect that they planned to fly it to tehran and 
then forward it as pharmaceuticals to baghdad the newspaper 
said 
the independent said it had copies of some of the original 
documents and had seen others 
the iraqis are most likely to use the chemical to make missile 
fuel but it could be used to make poison gas the newspaper said 
iraqs failure to obtain the chemical has held back saddams 
ballistic missile program it said 
the newspaper said the chemical can be used in the manufacture 
of hydrogen bombs but western experts do not believe iraq has 
adequate nuclear technology 
julian perryrobinson an authority on the science of chemical 
weapons was quoted as saying the chemical is also needed for 
lithium aluminum hydride which can be used to produce nerve gases 
saddam has used chemical weapons against iranians during the 
sevenyear gulf war and on ethnic kurds fighting for independence 
in northern iraq

a state appeals court has upheld the 
murder and child abuse convictions of a christian scientist couple 
who withheld medical treatment from their 7yearold diabetic 
daughter 
william and christine hermanson should never have been allowed 
to argue at trial that constitutional religious freedom exempted 
them from prosecution the 2nd district court of appeal ruled 
friday 
the right to practice religion freely does not include liberty 
to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the 
latter to ill health or death the appeals court said quoting a 
1944 us supreme court decision 
hermanson 43 a former sarasota banker and his 39yearold 
wife were convicted last year of felony child abuse and 
thirddegree murder in the 1986 death of their daughter amy from 
untreated diabetes 
in accordance with their christian science beliefs the 
hermansons shunned modern medicine to treat amy and instead relied 
on prayer 
as the jury could and did determine the hermansons 
acknowledged absolute right to hold their religious beliefs did not 
permit them to exercise that right at the price of amys life 
the appeals court said in its 32page decision 
i think they covered the whole ballpark with it said 
assistant state attorney deno economou the lead trial prosecutor 
im extremely pleased 
defense attorney thomas dart said he would have to study the 
decision further to determine whether to appeal 
regardless of further legal proceedings spokesman nathan talbot 
said the bostonbased church must maintain its efforts to make 
people understand christian scientists reliance on prayer 
well just have to continue to let people know that theres an 
alternative method of healing that doesnt have a perfect track 
record but has been so successful that a large segment of society 
relies on it talbot said 
the hermansons were given suspended fouryear prison sentences 
placed on probation for 15 years and ordered to seek medical 
treatment for their surviving children they have moved to st 
louis since their convictions and could not be reached for comment 
saturday a message was left on their answering machine 
courts in various states have delivered split decisions in 
similar cases in which parents who shun traditional medicine for 
religious reasons have been charged in the deaths of their 
children in a case in july a christian science couple in boston 
was convicted of manslaughter in the death of their 2yearold 
son

consulted with world leaders on the persian gulf crisis saturday as 
a top soviet official pledged moscow would send troops into 
military action if it were sanctioned by the united nations

with more than two dozen leaders was aimed at shoring up the 
consensus of global outrage over iraqs invasion of neighboring

un secretary general javier perez de cuellar 
he conducted the first six of the meetings saturday concluding 
with an evening session with kaifu whose government has pledged 4 
billion to support the multinational force in the gulf and to aid 
the frontline states of jordan egypt and turkey 
bush asked kaifu to ensure that the money is disbursed quickly 
and the japanese leader pledged that it would be officials from 
both sides said bush also urged that tokyo increase the money it 
contributes to underwrite the cost of keeping us forces in japan 
it goes without saying that japan should continue to 
increase spending for that purpose said taizo watanabe the 
spokesman for kaifu 
kaifu invited bush to make a state visit to japan early next 
year and bush readily accepted solomon said the dates still must 
be worked out 
shevardnadze meanwhile made a commitment to involve soviet 
forces in any action against iraq authorized by the united nations 
the soviet official said we will comply with any decision 
with any resolution of the security council and that would 
include anything regarding the involvement of the soviet troops 
under the flag under the auspices of the united nations he 
made his comments in a taped interview for broadcast sunday on nbc

persian gulf to join the forces of arab countries britain france

baghdad

friday that the united states was considering making a new request 
for action to the united nations the un already has adopted 
eight resolutions condemning iraqs aggression and imposing trade

the atrocities the devastation inside kuwait really are 
worthy of world attention and a un resolution is one way to bring 
that kind of attention scowcroft said at a briefing on bushs 
trip

action that mentions the military option available under article 
42 which authorizes the use of all appropriate measures 
including force to enforce sanctions

bushs meetings with leaders

it cited as its source an unidentified senior officer attached 
to the british 7th armored brigade which began leaving for the 
persian gulf on saturday from bremerhaven west germany 
we do not comment on any aspect of our nuclear capability 
said a defense ministry spokesman who in line with british 
practice would not allow use of his name 
the ministry refused to say if the brigade normally stationed 
in germany was taking along its 155mm selfpropelled howitzers 
which can fire w48 nuclear shells or conventional high explosive 
the newspaper said the nuclear shells are normally held by the 
british in dual custody with american troops 
w48 shells are equivalent to 100 metric tons of high explosive 
which is 100 times smaller than the atomic bomb dropped on 
hiroshima at the end of world war ii the report added

iraqi atrocities in occupied kuwait could 
prompt the united states to return to the united nations to seek 
tougher sanctions against saddam hussein possibly even military 
action the white house says 
on friday kuwaits exiled emir sheik jabir alahmed alsabah 
gave president bush a harrowing account of what the president 
called a population assaulted incarcerated intimidated and even 
murdered 
the narrative included tales of babies being removed from 
incubators and critically ill patients being taken off lifesupport 
systems so that the hospital machinery could be sent back to iraq 
said national security adviser brent scowcroft 
it was a pretty devastating account especially in the face of 
saddam hussein saying he is the defender of the arabs against the

washington ap the bush administration is moving ahead with a 
test sale of 5 million barrels of stockpiled oil despite 
contentions by lawmakers and its own energy secretary that the 
amount is too small 
the energy department sent out formal notices of the sale friday 
as the house voted to give president bush authority to triple its 
size as recommended a day earlier by energy secretary james 
watkins 
the white house stopped short of disavowing watkins suggestion 
that the 5millionbarrel sale announced by bush on wednesday was 
too small to even test how the 590millionbarrel strategic 
petroleum reserve might work in an oil emergency 
wed have to look at any proposal to expand it said steven 
hart a white house spokesman 
 
washington ap one of the worlds last great gothic churches 
was to be formally completed today with president bush and 
thousands of others gathering on the grounds of washington national 
cathedral to see the final stone put in place 
it was a long time coming it was just 83 years ago to the day 
that president theodore roosevelt rode to mount st albans the 
highest point in the capital to see the foundation stone laid a 
crowd of 10000 braved threatening weather to join him 
the stone reserved to the last is a 1000pound piece of indiana 
limestone carved in the shape of a folded leaf or flower it has 
been on display inside but was moved onto the grounds of the 
cathedral to be lifted into place by a crane 
the stone will rest on the southwest pinnacle of the catherals 
st paul tower 
 
united nations ap president bush has a plan to combat 
measles and aids in the young but still opposes a childrens rights 
treaty endorsed by scores of other nations say us officials at a 
conference examining those issues 
bush was expected to unveil the program to more than 70 other 
world leaders at the twoday world summit for children scheduled 
to begin today 
the convention on the rights of the child which went into 
effect this month requires nations to guarantee the survival of 
children and their development it sets new standards for fighting 
child neglect sexual exploitation and other abuse 
but us officials say they are not yet ready to support the 
treaty though it already has been ratified by 43 nations and 
endorsed by more than 100 others

theres a lot of babble about unconventional tv 
shows nowadays mainly by people who talk about but dont watch 
twin peaks but there are some truly unconventional shows 
about 
case in point abcs veteran tuesday series about high school 
life head of the class which began its fifth season last 
month its wellcrafted literate and even funny 
this cant be said of the newer high school sitcoms nbcs 
ferris bueller and foxs parker lewis cant lose theyre 
so conventional that the students are smarter than their teachers 
and high school principals 
abcs class on the other hand is set in an honors program 
class its students are there to learn and as in the earlier era 
of abcs longrunning welcome back kotter the teacher knows 
more than they do 
if you havent yet seen this seasons class you might take 
a look tonight because it has yet another unconventional touch a 
new history teacher from scotland played by comedian billy 
connolly 
connolly who even is from scotland brings a wonderful warmth 
and exuberance to the show 
full of good will with a musical lilt to his voice he belies 
the rumor that all scots are dour the rumor started in 1746 after 
the scots and the english had a frank exchange of views at a place 
called culloden 
as oxfordeducated billy macgregor connolly succeeds howard 
hesseman who played the original more laidback teacher charlie 
moore but left to pursue various nonseries projects 
in the class premiere moores departure was explained as a 
sudden exit to take a shot at acting as one student jokingly put 
it he left to be in a lowbudget musical seven brides for one 
brother 
there is some resentment of the newcomer with the strange accent 
and obvious eyes for the lovely vice principal jeannetta arnett 
most of the resentment is by dennis dan schneider the rotund 
chemistry whiz who berates the class nerd arvid dan frischman 
for taking such an immediate liking to the new teacher 
but its hard not to like a guy who not only knows his history 
but also describes the first westward rush of east germans after 
the berlin wall came down as a tangled wave of bad denim 
in tonights episode connolly who greets his young charges 
each morning with a cheery good morning geniuses has to cope 
with the impact of a flu epidemic on a citywide high school 
shakespeare competition 
there might not be an epidemic at his school were it not for 
arvid obsessed with maintaining a perfect attendance record he 
insists on coming to class even though hes so stricken by flu he 
faints at the start of the show 
this prompts macgregor to tell him you look like smmething 
the cat dragged in changed its mind dragged back out again came 
back in threw up went back out dragged it farther away and 
diiiiiiiied 
its not said meanly though but in the caring tradition and 
gentle humor of yesteryears kotter who like macgregor taught in 
a new york school albeit to a class that was er of a lower iq 
there also are nice bits of byplay in class between the 
lovely vice principal and the new teacher as when he agrees to 
help out in the fluravaged shakespeare competition 
assuming a shakespearean look he intones i would sooner mine 
eyes be plucked from my head than deny thy lips request 
she smiles sweetly thats beautiful but its not 
shakespeare 
yep this is unconventional television dont know if itll 
survive why the kids dont even say surfs up 
but take a look at this class tonight you may enroll in it 
 
elsewhere in television 
on the frontline of global dumping public tvs frontline 
starts its ninth season tonight with a 60minute report by 
frontline visitor bill moyers on the international export of 
toxic waste from the united states entitled global dumping 
ground its a collaboration by moyers the center for 
investigative reporting and san francisco public tv station kqed
