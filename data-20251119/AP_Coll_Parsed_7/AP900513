national guardsmen and volunteers rushed to sandbag 
watersoftened levees saturday and 7000 people were under an 
evacuation warning because of the worst flooding in parts of texas 
oklahoma arkansas and louisiana since the early 1900s 
fierce storms dumped 2 to 4 inches of rain on northwestern 
louisiana where the red river already was rising from water 
draining down from the oklahomatexas border area heavy rain also 
fell in nearby northeastern texas and an additional 2 to 3 inches 
of rain was possible during the weekend officials said 
poisonous snakes and fire ants driven out of cover by the water 
made emergency workers nervous 
water had inundated more than 250000 acres of arkansas farmland 
and more than 18000 cattle were stranded officials said in 
texas flooding had caused between 500 million and 700 million in 
agricultural damage with millions more to homes and roads 
hundreds of texas cattle have drowned in floodwater since thursday 
over the past three weeks 12 deaths have been blamed on 
flooding in texas and one in oklahoma 
the federal emergency management agency on saturday declared 
four more texas counties disaster areas from storms and flooding 
that began april 15 bringing the total to 29 
along texas rampaging trinity river about 500 residents 
voluntarily left subdivisions downstream from the lake livingston 
dam after liberty county judge dempsie henley issued an evacuation 
warning for 7000 people in lowlying areas 
he said officials projected that four to five times the normal 
discharge would go over the dams spillway when the trinitys flood 
crest reaches the reservoir 
tuesday through friday we will have the crest come in here 
and we will have a major dangerous flood the highest in the 
history of the county since the lake was built henley said 
already saturday every road and bridge leading into the eight 
or so housing developments along the trinity was as much as 6 feet 
under water 
the only transportation is by boat said henley adding that 
some people wanted to stay to guard their property 
houston county judge john musgrove estimated that at least 500 
head of cattle have drowned in his county which is about 130 miles 
southeast of dallas 
in louisiana forecasters said the red river would reach a 
45year high in shreveport by early this week although no major 
flooding was expected in the city 
the us army corps of engineers said the volume of water 
expected to move through the region would exceed that of record 
floods in 1927 and 1957 but that levees and other flood control 
measures built since then would prevent a disaster 
downstream in avoyelles parish national guardsmen arrived 
saturday to help finish a fivemile levee that about 50 farmers 
started building themselves friday with farm machinery to protect 
cropland from the rising river 
thats a major undertaking to build something that long that 
fast said michael logue spokesman for the corps of engineers 
district in vicksburg miss 
upstream in arkansas volunteers sandbagged a levee at garland 
where the river threatened us 82 the only major thoroughfare 
still open into the texarkana area from the arkansas side 
westbound lanes of interstate 30 were closed at fulton where the 
river crested around 34 feet friday 7 feet above flood stage 
its going to maintain a crest like that for at least 72 hours 
and maybe longer because weve got rain that will affect the 
river said state emergency official gary talley basically 
all the levees along that area are threatened because of the high 
water and long crest period 
in the northeastern corner of texas officials were concerned 
about a 4 to 5mile section of levee holding back the red river 
north of texarkana 
the levee is continuing to deteriorate a little bit because 
the ground is totally saturated from rains its like walking on 
jello said dave hall texarkana emergency management 
coordinator 
some volunteers sandbagging the levees overnight encountered 
poisonous snakes 
in addition to worrying about the water pressure on the levee 
it is spooky when you are down there with only a flashlight and 
suddenly walk up on a water moccasin or two hall said 
elsewhere in texas north of liberty wildlife officials 
collected a 16foot alligator that was washed onto a highway 
saturday said jim mitchum liberty county emergency coordinator 
were not known for alligators in this area he said i 
guess it just came out of the swamps 
mitchum said the flooding also brought out floating masses of 
fire ants named for their sting 
and theres nothing like seeing fire ants piled a foot high 
coming right at you he said 
in oklahoma forecasters saturday predicted at least a twoday 
respite from rain in the states southern and eastern sections 
weve switched from a response to a recovery mode state

about 300 jewish tombstones were desecrated 
in a haifa cemetery with spraypainted slogans including some that 
called on arabs to kill the jews officials said sunday 
national police commissioner yaacov turner said investigators 
were uncertain if the desecration was the work of arab extremists 
we must deal very sensitively with the issuebecause no 
one can say at this moment who did it and how he said 
all the slogans were written in hebrew noam gabrieli a city 
official said the hebrew was grammatical and the language was not 
typical of that used in palestinian leaflets he said the 
desecration therefore may have been the work of a mentally unstable 
person rather than arab radicals 
a police antiriot squad was sent to the kfar samir cemetery to 
prevent any violent demonstrations by relatives and other israelis 
who rushed to the scene after the news was reported on israeli 
radio stations 
the desecration was condemned by jewish and arab leaders alike 
and mayor arieh gurel called on all haifa residents to keep calm 
this is a sick action from people who learned from the 
neonazis we will cutoff the hands of those who did this gurel 
told a reporter 
gurel and turner suggested the incident in haifa was inspired by 
the desecration of 34 graves in the french town of carpentras where 
one corpse was dug up and impaled on a umbrella four skinheads 
were questioned and released 
the desecretion in israel took place in two sections of the 
haifa cemetery apparently during the jewish sabbath when guards 
were not present 
haifa a mediterranean port city in northern israel where 10 
percent of the 220000 population is arab has been symbol of 
arabisraeli coexistence despite the 30monthold palestinian 
uprising in the occupied territories 
yosef yisraeli whose mother and motherinlaw are buried in 
kfar samir told reporters at the scene i saw the horrible sight 
and my blood boiled 
israel radio broadcast an interview with one grieving relative 
who weeped uncontrollably as he said kill them kill them and 
dont kill them gently 
another man who said he was a taxi driver but declined to give 
his name told a reporter he rushed to the cemetery even though 
none of his relatives were buried there because i couldnt 
believe my ears 
the man said he prayed over a grave that had been painted with a 
slogan that said mubarak kill the jews a reference to 
president hosni mubarak of egypt which has a peace treaty with 
israel i prayed there because mubarak is supposed to represent 
peace he said 
a memorial for the prestate jewish haganna militia in the older 
section of the cemetery was also scrawled with slogans 
one slogan spraypainted on a grave said moslem brothers 
destroy the jews and found palestine still others called on arab 
villages and arab leaders such as iraqs saddam hussein to burn 
the jews

soldiers stormed the national 
radio station on sunday and arrested a handful of dissidents who 
occupied the building and claimed in a broadcast that the

has reportedly ended a us embassy official said in a telephone 
interview from madagascar the crowd in front of the station has 
been dispersed

5000 people who milled around the radio station located near the 
islands hilton hotel it was not known whether they supported the 
rebels or were simply curious 
tear gas canisters were fired off right in front of the hilton 
hotel a dutch guest said in a telephone interview in the 
afternoon there are still quite a few people in the street at 
the moment 
fter the dissidents occupied the station sunday morning a woman 
came on the air and called on the population to rise up against the 
government however her broadcast was cut off after about 45 
minutes

president bushs surprise move to seek a grand 
budget compromise with congress could backfire and hand the 
president the very recession he had hoped to avoid private 
economists warn 
the fear is that cutting the budget deficit by the size being 
discussed a combination of spending restraints and new taxes in 
the range of 60 billion to 100 billion would take a lot of 
steam out of the economy 
with economic growth only expected to average an anemic 2 
percent this year such a wallop could easily push the country into 
a recession putting an end to the longest peacetime expansion on 
record 
this could be a classic case of doing the right thing at the 
wrong time said david jones an economist at aubrey g lanston amp 
co in new york 
jones predicted that the adverse impact from a budget agreement 
would hit in late 1991 or early 1992 at which time the loss of 
government spending in both domestic and military programs and 
lower disposable income from higher taxes would be enough to 
trigger an economic slump 
it would be the worst possible environment for the president 
to run for reelection jones said in an interview last week 
it could make george bush a oneterm president 
however other economists argued that the president is right to 
take the risk of reaching a farreaching agreement that finally 
would resolve the deficit problem that has plagued the country for 
nearly a decade 
these economists believe a successful budgetreduction package 
would result in a significant drop in interest rates reflecting a 
reduced government drain on capital markets 
it would be unfortunate if a weak economy deterred the 
president and congress from making a major fix on the budget 
said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co it really is 
the right time provided that the federal reserve responds to offset 
the budgetary restraint 
but even the optimists concede that such a scenario will be 
difficult to pull off given the fact that actions such as tax 
increases and moves by the fed to lower interest rates often have 
long and unpredictable lag times 
the danger is that fiscal policy taxes and spending and 
monetary policy interest rates wont be coordinated said david 
wyss senior economist at drimcgraw hill the fed should really 
start loosening now to counteract spending cuts that would go into 
effect in october and a tax increase that would take effect in 
january 
top fed policymakers will meet behind closed doors on tuesday to 
map monetary strategy but few analysts are looking for any 
immediate credit easing given current fed concerns that inflation 
remains a problem 
the bush administration has been unsuccessfully pressuring the 
fed for months to ease credit policies fearing that higher 
interest rates would slow the economy and make the administrations 
deficit reduction goals unobtainable 
in january the administration released a proposed budget for 
the 1991 fiscal year which begins oct 1 that projected a deficit 
of 100 billion without any changes in policy 
the administration proposed a 36 billion package of spending 
cuts and modest tax increases to reach the grammrudman deficit 
reduction target of 64 billion 
the administrations proposal was attacked at the time as overly 
optimistic and events so far this year have proven the critics 
correct 
interest rates have risen higher than the administrations 
forecast raising the cost of financing the 3 trillion government 
debt at the same time the economy has not grown as fast bringing 
in less tax revenues in addition the cost of rescuing failed 
savings and loans has skyrocketed 
white house budget director richard darman now says the deficit 
absent any corrections could soar as much as 100 billion higher 
than the 64 billion target triggering massive acrosstheboard 
spending cuts in both military and defense programs under the 
grammrudman law 
economists are in agreement that arbitrary spending cuts of that 
magnitude would be harmful and it would be better to couple less 
draconian spending reductions with a package of tax increases 
the need to raise taxes to cut the deficit is even winning 
endorsement among business leaders normally a group opposed to tax 
increases 
many of the corporate executives attending the spring meeting of 
the business council last week in hot springs va said tax 
increases would be a reasonable price to pay to lower us interest 
rates and thus reduce the borrowing costs for new plant and 
equipment 
we need more capital and a cheaper price of capital said 
willard butcher head of chase manhattan 
other business leaders said that if bush failed to get the 
deficit under control before the onset of the next recession it 
would be disastrous 
the risks on the other side are terribly worrying said 
lewis t preston head of jp morgan amp co another large new york 
bank if we get a recession of any magnitude we would be talking 
about deficits of 200 billion to 300 billion more than we 
currently have and that would be very difficult to manage

both harvey gantt and andrew young are black 
democrats seeking statewide office but one wants a runoff election 
and the other doesnt highlighting one of the most sensitive 
divisions in southern politics 
some analysts call the runoff system racist others say it 
simply assures that a party runs its strongest nominee they agree 
however that minority and liberal candidates almost always lose 
when forced into oneonone runoffs with more conservative whites 
runoff elections are required in nine southern and border states 
if no primary candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote on 
the first goround in north carolina the secondplace finisher 
can demand a runoff if the top votegetter garners less than 40 
percent 
gantt the former mayor of charlotte got 38 percent of the vote 
in north carolinas us senate primary last week he pleaded with 
secondplace finisher michael easley who is white to forgo a june 
5 runoff 
but easley refused and is expected to pick up most of those who 
supported the other two losing white candidates in the democratic 
primary the eventual winner will take on conservative republican 
sen jesse helms in november 
in georgia young is leading the democratic gubernatorial field 
with about 30 percent of the vote but he is opposed to a lawsuit 
filed last week that seeks to abolish the states runoff system 
its heightening the tensions in the state said merle 
black a politics and government professor at emory university 
it makes it much harder for him to get the share of the white 
vote that he needs he certainly doesnt want the rules changed in 
the middle of the game 
georgias runoff system was instituted in 1964 and sponsors of 
the legislation clearly indicated its purpose was to dilute black 
political strength 
but most runoff systems originated early in the century when 
blacks did not vote the south had virtually no republican party 
and a democratic primary victory was tantamount to election 
runoffs were used to narrow the democratic field and unify the 
party 
many political scientists swear by the principle of majority 
rule and some believe the runoff system should be universal 
i dont think you want to get a party nominee who represents 
only onefifth of the party said larry sabato of the university 
of virginia i would personally favor a 40 percent or 45 percent 
cutoff and having a runoff for all states because the dangers 
always present that you could get a very unrepresentative nominee 
party strength is the reason most often used to justify runoffs 
but some say the oneonone contests merely prolong vicious party 
infighting and can severely wound the eventual nominee 
all the republican has to do is pick up on all the charges 
and just continue the fight said thad beyle a political science 
professor at the university of north carolina 
william schneider a political analyst with the american 
enterprise institute said the runoffs in many instances are merely 
a way for democrats to avoid nominating blacks 
theres plenty of contest now from republicans in general 
elections he said so what is the purpose of the runoff to 
strengthen the party not necessarily theres another unspoken 
purpose to keep from nominating blacks or it could be phrased 
weaker candidates 
schneider called the runoff system a terrible racist idea 
that forces black candidates to prove themselves twice 
other analysts say runoffs are not inherently racist although 
racism can color the results and they say changing the nominating 
structure is not the way to deal with that problem 
eliminating runoffs wont eliminate racism said earl black 
a political scientist at the university of south carolina 
you have to make people confront their biases through 
education through religion through civil rights demonstrations 
this is how you reach people said sabato 
merle black who is earl blacks brother said runoffs have 
produced many prominent figures who won runoffs after secondplace 
primary finishes among them a young georgia democrat named sam 
nunn now chairman of the senate armed services committee 
by contrast he and others say the absence of runoffs can have 
disappointing results for example 
ray blanton who won a crowded tennessee primary with barely a 
fifth of the vote he became governor in 1974 and later was 
indicted on a variety of corruption charges 
marshall coleman who won virginias gop gubernatorial 
nomination with 37 percent of the vote and narrowly lost the 1989 
general election to douglas wilder 
the nine states that have runoffs if a primary candidate doesnt 
get 50 percent are alabama arkansas florida georgia louisiana 
oklahoma mississippi south carolina and texas

a pennsylvania attorney is using last years 
congressional pay raise to give veteran democratic rep john murtha 
a rare primary challenge 
opponent kenneth burkley said he was within six to eight 
percentage points of murtha as tuesdays pennsylvania primary 
neared 
murtha chairman of the house defense appropriations 
subcommittee denies the race is that close but he has responded 
to burkleys challenge by using taped television ads with 
endorsements from democratic gov robert casey and former house 
speaker tip oneill of massachusetts 
this kind of ammunition usually is reserved for general 
elections if it is needed at all 
murtha faced no opponent in 1988 and this is the first real 
primary the congressman has had since 1982 said bill allen 
murthas spokesman 
murtha had a primary opponent in 1982 because his industrialized 
western pennsylvania district was combined with a neighboring one 
in the redistricting following the 1980 census he easily defeated 
democratic rep don bailey 
burkley a greensburg pa attorney making his first run for 
public office has hit murtha on the pay raise and on political 
action committee contributions 
hes a whos who of pacs burkley said 
in a 38048 vote on feb 7 1989 the house rejected a 51 
percent congressional pay increase proposed by a presidential 
commission murtha was among the 48 backing the pay hike 
the issue has long made democrats nervous 
i think its an important issue but its important for it to 
be placed in the context that changes in pay have taken place in a 
number of years in which congressman murtha has also supported 
steps to reduce outside earned income allen said the second 
half of the pay issue is removing conflicts of interest 
last november 1989 the house passed a different murthabacked 
bill raising salaries of its members federal judges and top 
executive branch officials by about onethird the bill bars house 
members from accepting honoraria or speaking fees beginning in 
1991 
burkley said murthas support of the raise was irresponsible in 
such budgetconscious times 
burkley has made inroads in the race although it is difficult 
to tell whether the pay raise is a reason why the candidates split 
endorsements from two major party groups burkley winning the 
surprise backing of the westmoreland county democratic committee 
and murtha capturing support of its cambria county counterpart 
burkley said he knows congressional salaries are politically 
sensitive if he defeats murtha he said he does not expect any 
support from national democrats if i use the pay raise 
burkley has raised 27285 in the past 15 months compared with 
murthas 256293 
of murthas total 154320 came from pacs 
elected in 1974 murtha is considered an oldstyle vote broker 
who shuns publicity 
also on the democratic ballot is veterinarian john k shrader 
businessman willeam choby faces fellow johnstown resident tony 
joseph for the gop nomination

democrats and republicans alike are 
reaffirming an old adage in their competing proposals for campaign 
finance reform if money is the mothers milk of politics lets 
dry up the other guys source 
with serious negotiations between leaders of the two parties in 
the senate scheduled to begin behind closed doors this week both 
are defining reform as weaning the other from its chief means 
of raising cash 
republicans describe as sewer money the estimated 45 
million to 60 million in unreported dollars that taxexempt 
organizations primarily unions spent last election on socalled 
independent getoutthevote drives largely on behalf of 
democratic candidates 
democrats accuse republicans of wanting to introduce more 
rather than less money into the political process by greatly 
expanding the role of wealthy individuals 
both want to increase the roles of their state and national 
party organizations as a conduit for money republicans with a 
much stronger party infrastructure already in place for raising and 
disbursing cash would do it much faster 
the two parties also agree on wanting to diminish the influence 
of political action committees or pacs an institution largely 
spawned by the last postwatergate round of reforms and 
republicans would like to abolish them entirely 
pacs accounted for 45 million or nearly onefourth of all the 
money spent on senate campaigns in 1988 nearly 80 percent of their 
contributions went to incumbents since there are more democratic 
than republican incumbents in congress democrats tend to benefit 
most from pac largesse 
president bush and republicans would prefer to eliminate pacs 
altogether but recognizing that the courts likely would hold such 
a broad ban to be an unconstitutional infringement on freedom of 
speech and association they have a fallback position 
union corporate and trade association pacs still would be 
abolished and the amounts that nonaffiliated ideological pacs 
such as those operated by the national rifle association 
environmental groups and both sides of the abortion issue can 
contribute to a candidate would drop from 10000 to 2000 per 
election cycle 
to make up for the lost revenue republicans would raise the 
25000 aggregate ceiling on individual contributions to candidates 
and parties for use in national elections to 340000 a year 
democrats contend the gop plan contains a loophole that would 
allow individuals to continue contributing even more money into 
state party coffers without having to report it to the federal 
election commission 
wealthy individuals and corporations could continue to give 
unlimited amounts of money to state party organizations senate 
democratic leader george mitchell of maine said of the republican 
proposal the practice that occurred in the 1988 elections when 
publicly funded presidential candidates raised upward of 45 
million in 100000 donations from individuals and corporations 
would continue unabated 
democrats would displace pacs with spending ceilings and a 
revived public financing scheme paid for by taxpayers 
volunteering to increase by 3 what they pay to the internal 
revenue service each year 
pacs would be prohibited by the democratic plan from 
contributing directly to candidates the limit on those 
contributions is now 10000 from any one pac to a candidate 
but the democrats would continue allowing pacs to give 15000 a 
year to party committees under their plan the national parties 
could still collect up to an aggregate 35 million a year from 
pacs and their senatorial campaign committees could collect another 
19 million 
the democrat bill fails the truthinadvertising test said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas what we have here in 
effect is a big moneylaundering scheme 
the rhetorical flourishes are expected to diminish once 
mitchell dole and four to five other key senators from the two 
sides begin negotiating behind closed doors later this week on 
seeking a compromise 
democrats are adamant that any compromise must contain some type 
of firm spending limits on candidates never declare republicans 
just as vehemently the average senatorial campaign in 1988 cost 
38 million 
both parties embraced portions of a bipartisan task forces 
recommendations calling for flexible ceilings but neither has 
accepted its suggestions entirely 
republicans rejected the task forces suggestion that a cap be 
placed on outofstate contributions instead adopting as a 
substitute the notion that nonresident donors should be limited to 
half or 500 what individuals can give directly to a candidate 
democrats likewise rejected the suggestion there should be no 
cap on small donations from instate contributors candidates could 
use those contributions to exceed the overall limits but only by 
25 percent under their proposal

a recent gunbattle between louisiana and 
vietnamese shrimpers over choice fishing waters has brought to the 
surface the tension each side feels in these lean times for the 
industry 
increased regulation dwindling resources rising costs and 
foreign competition coupled with language barriers and 
misunderstood cultural customs provide more than enough fuel to 
ignite an already heated situation in the gulf of mexico waters 
people on both sides say 
its tough for the guys out there said lt col charles 
clark of the louisiana wildlife and fisheries department people 
are struggling to survive and its not ethnic background its 
whos catching the shrimp that divides people 
i dont think its discrimination against the vietnamese 
fishermen said monsignor dominic luong pastor of mary queen of 
vietnam church i think it is a human thing you have the 
vietnamese fighting to achieve on the economic scale and you have 
the other fishermen trying to do the same thing the vietnamese do 
keep the rules but sometimes they dont understand the american 
rules in that situation tempers flare 
a federal grand jury is expected to look into the may 5 incident 
in which longtime local fishermen and vietnamese immigrants 
exchanged gunfire and rammed each others boats the coast guard 
officials intervened and briefly confiscated six shrimp boats no 
one was injured in the confrontation 
for the vietnamese who have struggled up from poverty owning 
their own boats is a step up but for louisiana shrimpers a way of 
life is rapidly crumbling 
the costs of shrimping including fuel nets and insurance have 
skyrocketed said capt sandy dares of wildlife and fisheries 
meanwhile shrimpers are coming off several bad years and a winter 
freeze that kept them landlocked for an extended period this year 
shrimpers are particularly bitter over the federal laws that 
require they use turtle excluder devices the teds allow the 
endangered kemps ridley sea turtle to escape from their nets but 
shrimpers say the turtle isnt caught in louisiana waters and the 
teds let half of their catch escape 
they just cant make any money so how do they pay for the 
boat and feed their families dares asked then youve got more 
regulations showing up every day not just the teds but lots of 
things like what they have to have on their boats and how they can 
dispose of their waste oil 
i just cant afford it said mark buras 37 of port 
sulphur you never did get rich shrimping one year would be 
good one year bad one year youd break even with the teds 
theyll all be bad its like having a big hole in the middle of 
the net 
many us native shrimpers believe the vietnamese arent using 
the teds according to donald lirette of dulac president of the 
terrebonne fishermens organization 
clark dismisses such talk as well as shrimpers charges that 
the vietnamese have bigger boats and use them to drive other 
shrimpers away from schools of shrimp when theyre found 
i dont think they have bigger boats if you look at it 
theres a lot of equal opportunity out there clark said when 
the shrimp are found its everyone for himself but to tell the 
truth when the vietnamese find shrimp theyre going for it 
theyre much more interested in harvesting the resource than in 
human compassion 
the language barrier is also blamed for many problems at sea 
shrimpers communicate by radio or shouting at one other 
the vietnamese only learn the american words for we found 
some shrimp said lirette they monitor the radio and when they 
hear that they head there that doesnt make the guy who found the 
shrimp and told his buddy happy 
in louisiana shrimpers never moved that much clark said 
they shrimped their own area and that was it the vietnamese 
are very migrant on the other hand they go anywhere they hear the 
shrimp are i dont think theyve grasped our sense of fair play 
and some of the shrimpers probably hold it against them 
foreign shrimp imports add to the problem dares said about 80 
percent of the shrimp consumed in the united states is imported 
and he said its cheaper than what louisiana shrimpers produce 
no matter what we do they can grow shrimp cheaper than we can 
catch them said kevin pennison of houma 
the economic squeeze for both groups is acute and for both the 
alternatives to shrimping are narrow now with the states economy 
shrunken because of oil industry problems 
what happened was most vietnamese came here and had no time to 
learn english or develop skills luong said they had to go 
right into the labor market to support their families for them 
owning their own business or boat is achieving on the economic 
scale they have moved up

the mess hall is a mess the army cook is 
harried and the jostling line of anxious diners is ready for a 
military meal of meat and potatoes 
these are not east german soldiers on a chow break however but 
romanians on the run scores are fleeing their east bloc nation 
daily for a former communist country that has moved more quickly 
toward reform 
about 700 romanians and a few hundred bulgarians have packed 
into two barracks at an east german army base on the outskirts of 
berlin hundreds more are housed in a building once used by east 
germanys feared secret police 
every day there are more they come here see the free food 
and the free housing and call home then more come maj harry 
kretschmer says as he strolls through a hallway packed with 
squalling children and milling adults 
we do not know what to do with them we are filled to 
capacity kretschmer said 
east germany reeling from a creaky economy and an exodus of its 
own citizens to west germany suddenly finds itself luring other 
east europeans whose countries do not have a wealthy neighbor to 
help them emerge from four decades of oppression 
the government said it decided last week to begin housing and 
feeding the romanians and bulgarians who show up daily in train 
stations with battered bags of belongings but no money 
many see east germany as the new threshhold of the west a 
passageway to prosperity 
i came here for work and to escape the communists says 
taian neascu 19 from bucharest i want to go to west germany 
and go to america 
at least 50 to 70 romanians daily arrive in east germany but 
the numbers may be much higher said matthias jahr a member of the 
east berlin foreigners commission 
romanians comprise the largest group of refugees jahr said 
followed by bulgarians the government has no figues on how many 
east europeans have flooded into the country in recent months 
but the newly opened borders in eastern europe have turned east 
germany into a crossroads of commerce and a lure for the 
disadvantaged thousands of poles travel daily to berlin to hawk 
wares along streets and in squares 
jahr also said his office has received numerous requests for 
asylum from soviet jews who want to flee a new wave of 
antisemitism at home 
the romanians began arriving in late april about the time 
political strife intensified in their country 
some romanians believe the revolutionary interim government led 
by acting president ion iliescu will not differ substantially from 
the communist regime that was overthrown in december 
scores of romanians began sleeping in the large train station in 
lichtenberg the huge foreign quarter of east berlin 
at first we were ignorant of the problem then we found all of 
these people sleeping in the train station said hannelora 
gensch an east berlin housing official who runs the complex in the 
beisdorf district 
children typically roam subway and train stations sent by their 
parents with cards printed in german we are romanian please 
help us with money 
many are sick when they arrive and most are afraid mrs gensch 
said 
we have had to put people in the hospital because of their 
fear she said the government has to make a decision on what 
to do with these people 
the stream comes just as resentment of foreigners is sweeping 
east germany fueled mainly by fears the country will face 
widespread unemployment as it merges with west germany and converts 
to a free market 
street clashes between foreigners and east german gangs broke 
out in lichtenberg a week ago 
one romanian at the army base a 36yearold man who said he 
drove a taxi in constanza said he left behind three young 
children he said he has no plans to return 
kretchsmer said he believes the motives are more economic than 
political 
some romanians at the barracks said they fled because they 
believed a new crackdown on travel would be imposed after may 20 
when iliescu is widely expected to win romanian elections 
the romanians and bulgarians fill two large bunkhouses at the 
base weapons were cleared out of large store rooms to create more 
space said kretschmer 
most came here on tourist visas and some said they still 
planned to go home 
maria caldarau 48 said through an interpreter she brought her 
six children so they could get better medical attention 
jahr said the government should discuss visa requirements with 
other east european countries as a way of limiting the flow 
we dont want to build a new wall he said

on the bright side the republic has survived 
andrew dice clays saturday night live gig and he even ended 
the show wishing his mother and mothers everywhere a happy mothers 
day 
but the dice man clad in black threads a black leather jacket 
and smoking a filter cigarette more resembled the star of a 
brooklyn geek festival than the noholdsbarred prince of dirty he 
is said to be 
nbc aware of his tendency to call women bitches verbally 
assail gays and even use naughty words aired saturdays show on a 
fivesecond delay basis so it could bleep out anything obscene or 
worse 
dumb move it should have rigged the tapedelay to say tuba 
when bleeping or even on those occasions it let go what clay said 
for example during his opening monologue a protesting couple 
in the studio audience shouted clay clay go away they were 
quickly whisked out by guards the startled clays snappy comeback 
was shadddup 
that figures his routine stepped out for a short beer when wit 
was passed out things might have been better had nbc inserted 
tuba where he got well crude about one of those ejected you 
would have heard him say 
thats the type a guy that hangs out in the mens room to 
smell other peoples tuba all day long 
same goes for his thoughts on the furor his appearance on the 
show caused including the boycott of the show by cast member nora 
dunn and pop singer sinead oconnor 
push the tuba button you would have heard him say 
i mean what do i need more pr i couldnt get any more 
pr if i took out my tuba and wrapped it around the microphone 
stand 
true he got bleeped only five times in one skit in which he 
played himself explaining sex to his son no doubt this was because 
he used gosh crude words to describe the male and female 
genitalia 
but five shots of tuba would have put him in perspective he 
works dirty because he has no act 
the show like its guest host was an epic in lame even in such 
nonclay skits as the anal retentive chef or dennis millers 
weekend update on which the annoying man appeared and squeezed 
a pimple 
about the only mildly witty moment came when the funny gifted 
jan hooks told the audience she lacked the guts to protest clays 
appearance but had decided to protest him by giving a lackluster 
performance 
the show predictably spoofed the clay uproar right from the 
start with a takeoff of its a wonderful life in which the 
devil showed clay what would have happened had clay not been born 
among other things frank zappa would have appeared in his place 
on the show and done a 70minute anticensorship rap causing the 
shows ratings to plummet and the ax to fall on saturday night 
after 15 years 
that wouldnt be such a bad idea snl once had a firstrate 
cast a sense of comic danger and inspired routines all that now 
is on fox broadcastings new in living color a very funny yet 
compassionate show 
not much is left of saturday night live when all it can do 
is call on a guy who only can talk dirty a guy from the land of 
nobody home

us and filipino officials open talks monday 
on the future of their military alliance with both sides convinced 
that major changes are needed if a new base agreement is to be 
reached 
bush administration officials are sensitive to filipino 
objections about the existing agreement and are going to present 
an entirely new kind of arrangement philippines ambassador 
emmanuel pelaez said 
special us negotiator richard armitage will open exploratory 
talks on monday in manila with philippines foreign secretary raul 
manglapus 
the talks come amid heightened tensions in the philippines 
following the murders sunday of two us servicemen near clark air 
base including sundays victims eight americans have died in 
politically motivated slayings in the philippines since april 1989 
us officials blamed communist rebels for the first six slayings 
the talks are aimed at replacing the 1947 military bases 
agreement which expires on sept 16 1991 at stake is the future 
subic bay naval base clark air base and four smaller us military 
facilities 
in an interview last week pelaez called the 1947 agreement 
anachronistic and said radical changes would be required for 
the us presence to continue after next year 
pelaez said the talks initially will focus on how us and 
filipino security requirements have been affected by the changing 
international situation particularly the easing of eastwest 
tensions 
but security questions sometimes have become overshadowed by 
other aspects of the american presence in the philippines such as 
us monetary compensation to the host government and whether the 
existence of the bases infringes on filipino sovereignty 
the negotiations over base rights in the philippines have 
become largely an issue of price and pride a delegation of seven 
house members said in a report after an inspection trip to the 
western pacific last month 
the delegation examined possible alternatives to the us 
military bases in the philippines 
the consensus among american officials is that the functions now 
being carried out at the philippine bases could be scattered to 
multiple sites elsewhere in the region such as singapore japan 
and guam 
but the administration is intent on making every effort to 
retain its presence in the philippines in contrast philippines 
president corazon aquino has been noncommittal reflecting the deep 
divisions among her countrymen 
stephen bosworth a former us ambassador to the philippines 
said he is moderately optimistic an agreement can be reached and 
pelaez shares that view 
bosworth believes that a reduced us presence would go a long 
way toward easing filipino concerns about perceived us 
infringement on philippine sovereignty 
about 40000 americans are stationed in the philippines carrying 
out baserelated activities 
defense department figures show that the impact on the local 
economy of the us facilities is substantial combined us air 
force and navy spending was 531 million in fiscal 1988 
but filipino authorities reacted angrily last year when congress 
cut 96 million from the 481 million aid package the 
administration had promised annually as part of the compensation 
the us provides for access to the bases 
another sore point for many filipinos is that us servicemen 
are rarely prosecuted under filipino law since there various legal 
ways for us authorities to take jurisdiction 
but polls show a majority of filipinos favor a continued us 
presence and that sentiment is shared by countries nearby 
virtually all countries in the area are happy to have the us 
there a us official said last week but some members of 
congress favor a us withdrawal noting the bush administration is 
shutting down dozens of bases at home 
their sentiment is reinforced by the center for defense 
information a liberal research group 
david isenberg a research analyst at the center said we 
believe that the threat for which the bases were originally 
designed is obsolete the prospect of invasions by red china and 
the soviet union is now fantasy

the resonant ringing of the town bell 
from a whitesteepled church on main street has been a venerated 
fixture for nearly a century in this 320yearold new england 
farming community 
but a couple of newcomers who moved next to the bell when it 
wasnt working say the hourly clanging is taking its toll on their 
sleep they have sued the town to silence the bell at night some 
oldtimers resent the threat to the timehonored custom 
its been there for years said giles desmond who runs the 
town barbershop its a tradition 
bringing the civil suit are richard and pamela carnall who in 
august 1988 plunked down 220000 for a 19thcentury house on main 
street and prepared to embark on life in a small yankee town 
in december the town clock 50 feet from their home was repaired 
and they discovered a quaint tradition they hadnt bargained for 
the hourly clanging of an 1800pound bell 
it was just keeping me up all night there were nights that i 
didnt sleep at all mrs carnall testified in hampshire superior 
court last week the trial continues monday 
the carnalls are asking a jury to declare the bell a nuisance 
and decide whether they are entitled to damages if a jury agrees 
the couple will ask judge john f murphy to order the bell silenced 
from 9 pm to 6 am 
town officials are defending the ringing of the bell which is 
housed in the first congregational church tower but owned by the 
town residents have testified of their fond memories of hearing 
the bell calling farmers to the field and children to play for 91 
years 
its something that even if you are in bed at night and cant 
sleep you hear the bell ring george g zgrodnick jr chairman 
of the hatfield board of selectmen testified friday and i think 
it assures us it assures me that there is something working for 
the community all the time 
desmond said some in town agree that the bell probably should be 
turned off at night if only to extend a warmer welcome to the 
newcomers 
its like anything else theres pros and cons he said 
w michael ryan the couples attorney presented testimony that 
the bell is estimated at about 69 decibels about as loud as a 
vacuum cleaner inside the carnall home 
mrs carnall said she and her husband have tried running fans 
and machines that produce background noise to drown out the bell 
she said the ringing startles her infant daughter and means that 
all three members of the family must sleep in the same room with 
the door latched shut 
the carnalls have offered to pay for a mechanical device that 
would silence the chimes at night ryan said 
desmond and his wife rose who also live on main street 
although farther from the church said the noise of the bell 
depends on which way the wind blows the desmonds said they enjoy 
the chimes 
i cant believe in a year they havent got used to it mrs 
desmond said there are nights i lie awake and i hear the clock 
and i think well at least im in the right place

kidney failure was suspected in the death 
of an elephant whose calf was stillborn in a caesarian section last 
month zookeepers said sunday 
babe a 36yearold asian elephant died saturday at burnet park 
zoo the 7700pound elephant was taken to cornell universitys 
veterinary school where an autopsy continued sunday said don 
moore the zoos curator of mammals 
final autopsy results wont be available for a week to 10 days 
though veterinarians may have preliminary lab results by monday 
moore said 
babes death has prompted criticism from animal rights activists 
angry over the zoos breeding program burnet park is small by zoo 
standards but has an ambitious breeding program 
may god grant her the peace that man never did said joyce 
goike president of the central new york humane association on 
wednesday she asked the zoo to put babe to sleep rather than 
prolong the elephants suffering 
babes 22month pregnancy drew worldwide attention from 
zookeepers trying to breed endangered asian elephants in captivity 
had the pregnancy been successful babe would have been the 
oldest elephant to become a firsttime mother in a north american 
zoo but after a stalled labor babe underwent a caesarian section 
april 23 her 266pound bull calf died in the womb when it could 
not position itself properly for birth 
no elephant has ever recovered after a caesarian section 
zookeepers said 
right up to the time of babes death zookeepers were hopeful 
she would recover a day earlier babe had been taken off the 
critical list and upgraded to stable condition 
moore who helped on the autopsy said babes kidneys didnt 
look too good and that kidney failure probably caused her death 
gary maclachlan who heads the onondaga county parks agency that 
runs the zoo said babes death will raise questions about the 
zoos decision to breed her this may add fuel to any skepticism 
people have had he said 
animal rights activists complain about the mortality rate of 
newborns at the zoo of about 300 mammals born there last year 59

the zoos breeding program will continue despite babes death 
said county executive nicholas pirro a second asian elephant at 
the zoo is expected to give birth in july 1991 
nothing that has happened will stop us from what the zoo 
people believe and i agree is the best we can do to preserve this 
species pirro said 
an asian elephant expert agreed that burnet park should continue 
its breeding program 
theyre certainly not guilty of anything except incredibly bad 
luck said roger henneous senior elephant keeper at the 
washington park zoo in portland ore the washington park zoo the 
nations premier asian elephant breeder has had 24 births in the

lithuanias prime minister said sunday she 
believed she had gained de facto recognition for her breakaway 
republic from the united states and other western governments she 
visited on a 16day trip abroad 
stopping in moscow on her way home to vilnius kazimiera 
prunskiene said leaders in the five countries she visited 
acknowledged lithuanias right to independence and backed talks to 
resolve its standoff with the kremlin 
asked about lithuanias quest for diplomatic recognition mrs 
prunskiene said this is de facto recognition the fact that i 
came to these countries that several of them received me on a very 
high governmental level that these consultations occur thats 
already recognition that this is not just an internal affair of the 
soviet union 
mrs prunskienes trip was part of a growing campaign by all 
three baltic republics to gain full independence the presidents of 
latvia estonia and lithuania met saturday to reestablish a 
56yearold political bloc and form a united front in their drive 
to secede from the soviet union 
in vilnius lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis said on 
sunday that the baltic leaders also had appealed to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and president bush asking both to 
take our problem into their hearts 
landsbergis declined to release the text of what he called a 
diplomatic communication but said he and the presidents of 
neighboring latvia and estonia also had asked gorbachev to meet 
with them 
the baltic republics were forcibly annexed by the soviet union 
in 1940 they have taken advantage of gorbachevs reforms to wage a 
careful parliamentary push for sovereignty that suddenly took a 
sharp turn march 11 when lithuania defied moscow and declared its 
independence 
moscow imposed a partial economic embargo on lithuania and 
threatened the other two republics the sanctions have forced the 
layoff of 12000 people in lithuania according to official reports 
a tanker carrying 80000 tons of petroleum was en route sunday 
to the lithuanian port of klaipeda to relieve the gasoline shortage 
stemming from the blockade lithuanian television reported the oil 
was purchased with money from emigre lithuanians officials said 
it was not clear whether soviet authorities would allow the tanker 
to dock at klaipeda 
mrs prunskiene traveling as a private citizen met in 
washington with bush and with leaders in canada france britain 
and west germany 
although she was warmly received the west in general has 
adopted a cautious attitude toward the situation in lithuania 
unwilling to cause more trouble for gorbachev as he wrestles with 
domestic reform 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater emphasized that bushs 
may 3 meeting with mrs prunskiene did not change the us policy 
of not formally recognizing lithuania as a separate country 
mrs prunskiene said on sunday she was heartened that western 
leaders were pushing negotiations between lithuania and the 
kremlin the fact that they see us lithuania and the soviet 
union as partners in negotiations is a sign that were already 
seen as a state she said 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and president francois 
mitterrand of france proposed in an april 26 letter that lithuania 
temporarily suspend its independence and enter into talks with 
moscow 
the two sides are interpreting the kohlmitterrand letter 
differently but appear to be edging toward a compromise similar to 
what it proposes 
mrs prunskiene reiterated that lithuania was prepared to 
suspend new laws that concern moscow as a condition for talks and 
said she expected the kremlin to raise its economic blockade of the 
republic of 37 million

debate about capital punishment is swirling around the country 
as a federal court on monday considers allowing californias first 
execution in 23 years louisiana awaits an electrocution friday and 
demonstrators march toward atlanta 
the death penalty outlawed in every other industrial country in 
the west is embroiled anew in arguments that touch on legal 
medical moral political and racial issues 
emotions are strong on all sides relatives of victims who want 
to see murderers put to death prosecutors tired of repeated stays 
of executions opponents who condemn statesponsored killing 
the death penalty is an issue that has a peculiar degree of 
sensitivity in the public mind even though people dont often see 
themselves as potential victims of murders or capital punishment 
charles j ogletree harvard professor of criminal law and former 
washington dc public defender said in an interview 
it gets a visceral reaction people are worried about crime a 
seeming loss of control a criminal system running amok and they 
think the death penalty is an answer to crime 
every major study has concluded that the death penalty does not 
deter capital crimes ogletree said yet polls show most americans 
still support capital punishment a fact that politicians havent 
ignored in current elections although most people say they would 
prefer life imprisonment without parole 
former california gov edmund g pat brown who wrote a book 
last year about his agonizing decisions to grant or withhold 
clemency to prisoners facing death sentences believes the publics 
attitude toward capital punishment will change as the pace of 
executions increases 
when they start gassing four people a day after 20 weeks 
of that people will be ready to get rid of it brown said 
people will see the futility of the death penalty 
people are not really in favor of the death penalty but 
theyre opposed to the outrageous number of homicides in the 
country theyre rightfully frightened and feel frustrated 
more than 2300 prisoners are on death rows around the country 
and their numbers increase nearly every week as the appeals process 
blocks executions and more killers are convicted thirtysix states 
have capital punishment statutes 
since the 1976 us supreme court ruling allowing states to 
resume use of the death penalty 125 people have been executed 
the latest last friday in potosi mo where winford stokes died by 
lethal injection for killing a woman 12 years ago 
the pace of executions brown envisioned does not appear to be 
coming soon stokes was the fifth person executed this year from 
1984 through 1989 an average of 19 people a year were executed 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in san francisco will hear 
arguments monday on the execution of robert alton harris convicted 
of the 1978 murders of two san diego teenagers 
harris scheduled to die april 3 in san quentins gas chamber 
was granted a stay four days earlier by 9th circuit judge john 
noonan he said a lowercourt judge may have erred in dismissing 
harris claim of incompetent psychiatric assistance without holding 
a factfinding hearing 
a psychiatric evaluation also is at the center of a case in new 
orleans where a man with borderline retardation dalton prejean 
who killed a state trooper in 1977 is scheduled to die in the 
electric chair friday a state judge last week rejected the latest 
attempt to save prejean saying it is time to let justice be 
done after 10 stays of execution and 10 years on death row 
a group calling itself the national pilgrimage for abolition of 
the death penalty is due to arrive in atlanta on saturday after a 
400mile march from starke fla where murderer jessie tafero was 
electrocuted may 4 
the group which will end its march at the martin luther king 
jr center for nonviolent social change includes coretta scott 
king widow of the slain civil rights leader and the rev joseph 
lowery president of the southern christian leadership conference 
theres no question that the issue of race is foremost in the 
minds of many of those who oppose capital punishment ogletree 
said 
among the inmates on death row 43 percent are black more than 
three times the percentage of blacks in the general population 
according to the naacp legal defense and educational fund of the 
125 executed 41 percent were black 
the race of the victims also plays a role in whether convicted 
killers are sentenced to death some critics say more than twice 
as many blacks who killed whites were executed since 1973 as blacks 
who killed other blacks naacp figures show 
in chicago federal prosecutors last week said they will seek 
the death penalty for two men charged with killing a drug case 
witness in what could be the first execution by the federal 
government in 27 years a 1988 federal law allows capital 
punishment for some drugrelated homicides 
politicians up for election nationwide are lining up on either 
side of the death penalty and in some cases their stands on the 
issue are expected to play a significant role in the voting 
in california for example pollsters attribute former san 
francisco mayor dianne feinsteins edge in the democratic primary 
campaign for governor in part to her support of the death penalty 
her opponent state attorney general john van de kamp said he 
is personally opposed to capital punishment but he has taken a 
strong stand in favor of harris execution

taiwanese set off firecrackers sunday to 
welcome the goddess of democracy to northern keelung where the 
radio ship will refuel before heading for the high seas to 
broadcast prodemocracy messages to china 
authorities however gave a cool reception to the ship sending 
no official to greet the crew and refusing to allow chinese 
dissidents to board the vessel 
a high school band played music while journalists and 300 local 
residents crowded the pier to see the ship scheduled to leave 
monday for international waters to begin 24hour broadcasts into 
china 
we are here because we believe in freedom and democracy for 
all the world said dominique perreot the ships captain 
china has refused to rule out the use of force to stop the 
planned broadcasts and has warned that any help taiwan gives the 
ship would be considered an open provocation it also has said 
it would arrest those on board 
the 1200ton ship which left france on march 17 is sponsored 
by a coalition of press organizations headed by the french news 
magazine actuel with funds from several chinese overseas 
communities 
it is named after the statue made by prodemocracy demonstrators 
in tiananmen square last may and destroyed during the june 4 
military crackdown that left hundreds perhaps thousands of 
demonstrators dead 
yan jiaqi chairman of the parisbased federation for a 
democratic china said the planned broadcasts were particularly 
significant because they would occur close to the anniversary of 
the crackdown in beijing 
people on both sides of the taiwan straits should get together 
to fight for chinas democratization said yan 
earlier harbor officials rejected requests from yan and other 
chinese dissidents to board the ship to welcome the crew greetings 
took place on the pier where crew members received flowers from 
local residents 
although the taiwanese government is the sworn enemy of 
communist beijing tensions between the two sides have eased in 
recent years 
government officials have said the ship will not be allowed to 
return to taiwan if it makes unauthorized broadcasts ship 
organizers have said they will need to refuel at a taiwanese port 
after three weeks of broadcasting 
although taiwan has tried to distance itself from the vessel 
its military reported friday that it had sighted a submarine near 
the radio ship and restated earlier pledges to protect the vessel 
if it is attacked near taiwan 
china accused taiwan on sunday of covertly helping the mission 
the taiwan authorities that have been active in supporting the 
goddess of democracy in its illegal activities chinas official 
xinhua news agency said 
taiwans state broadcasting corp of china quoted unidentified 
chinese authorities as saying sunday that beijing officials would 
arrest any dissidents aboard the radio ship when it begins 
broadcasting 
chinese authorities also said they would arrest the ships crew 
for violating international laws by making unauthorized broadcasts 
according to a sunday edition of china time express 
our only protection is the live broadcasts from the ship if 
anything happens the world will know said christophe nick a 
journalist for actuel 
the ship will carry a french crew and several journalists but 
no chinese dissidents organizers have prepared taped programming 
and say they expect the broadcasts will be heard in beijing 
this is a private initiative created by a mobilization of 
reporters it serves nobody but press freedom said robert 
menard head of the parisbased reporters without borders we do 
not request any support from any government we just require to 
work in peace and independently 
the nationalist chinese government retreated to taiwan in 1949 
after losing a civil war to communist forces in mainland china 
while the two sides remain technically at war indirect trade and 
civilian contacts have increased greatly in recent years

poor productivity not meager budgets is the 
main problem of the nations schools a noted education researcher 
said sunday 
lewis j perelman of the hudson institute said american 
schools actually are shortchanging the nation by wasting some 100 
billion a year through sprawling bureaucracy and outmoded 
technology 
in a rebuttal to those who claim increased education spending 
will improve student achievement he said more spending on more 
of the same education will waste resources weaken the us economy 
and undermine the nations global competitiveness 
in a report released sunday the acanemia deception 
perelman said the united states spent 3310 to educate each 
student from preschool to grade 12 in 1985 the expenditure is 
second only to switzerland which spent 3683 the figures are 
based on a special 1985 index of purchasing power of industrial 
nations 
the statistics contradict a recent analysis by the economic 
policy institute that said the united states trailed 13 other 
industrial nations in spending on elementary and secondary 
education 
the epi recommended adding at least 20 billion per year to the 
nations kindergarten through 12th grade spending 
perelman a senior research fellow at the conservative hudson 
institute research group in indianapolis said the epi used 
tortured statistics in an attempt to discredit president bushs 
contention that the focus of education reform must no longer be on 
resources it must be on results 
perelman said better academic results do not require spending 
more on education and spending more on education is at least as 
likely to cause economic decline as to reverse it 
he said the united states spent 41 percent of its gross 
domestic product on kindergarten through 12th grades yet showed 
dismal achievement in mathematics and science 
south korea spent 31 percent on education spain 26 percent 
and the united kingdom 45 percent and all outperformed us 
students 
restructuring education does not require bigger budgets but 
different budget priorities he said 
key findings of perelmans report were 
us education labor costs were 93 percent of output compared 
with 54 percent for the average us business and 46 percent for 
hightech business 
education invests 100 to 1000 times less in research and 
development or in acquiring technology than most businesses and 
several thousand times less than hightechnology industries 
computers have been documented to increase efficiency and 
accelerate learning the report said there are 2 million computers 
in the nations 100000 schools about one for every 20 students 
that compares with 40 million personal computers in homes or one 
for every two homes 
among his recommendations perelman said 
every education and training institution organization and 
program in the united states should set aside at least 1 percent of 
its gross revenues for investment in research and development the 
funds could be pooled in a common fund administered by a new 
national institute for learning technology 
the goal of the new investment in educational initiative should 
be to double the productivity of us 
every student in america should have access to a distance 
learning network by the year 2001 he explained that teachers can 
instruct a variety of students across the state or country at the 
same time with the twoway video

czechoslovakias alexander dubcek said sunday 
that the prague spring reform movement of 1968 crushed by red army 
tanks helped plant the seeds of the revolutionary changes now 
sweeping eastern europe 
dubcek delivering the commencement address at american 
university also said czechoslovakia began to fear a loss of 
identity after the soviet invasion of 1968 
an act of violence and malevolence relegated us to the role of 
a pawn in a great game of politics dubcek said once again we 
were reminded that our country lies at the front line at the 
frontier of the cold war 
but he said the countrys push toward reform more than two 
decades ago influenced todays changes in eastern europe 
dubcek said soviet dissident andrei sakharov had written him a 
letter shortly before he died last year and recalled the hope that 
prague spring had given him and the bitterness that followed during 
years when time stood still 
but fire burned beneath the ashes i am convinced that the 
breath of truth that the czechs and slovaks inhaled is the 
prologue to todays bloodless revolutions in the countries of 
eastern europe dubcek quoted sakharov as writing 
if that is true then prague spring is the source of ideas 
that have resulted in the revolutionary changes presently taking 
place in our country which are taking place in the soviet union 
in eastern europe dubcek told graduates through an interpreter 
dubcek making his first visit to the united states met friday 
with secretary of state james a baker iii and members of congress 
he echoed the message czechoslovakian president vaclav havel made 
to congress three months ago voicing support for reform within the 
soviet union 
at a news conference saturday dubcek said president bushs 
proposed 300 million aid package for eastern europe was a very 
helpful starting point that would help open the doors for new 
entrepreneurs 
bush on saturday also called for creation of a citizens 
democracy corps in which us citizens could help build democracy 
in eastern europe 
at sundays ceremony american university also awarded dubcek an 
honorary degree calling him a symbol in the face of tyranny 
for launching the prague spring reforms and trying to create a new 
socialism with a human face 
dubcek who headed his countrys communist party at the time of 
the 1968 soviet invasion said the transition to democracy should 
be smooth gradual cultured civilized 
we are still searching for a path to make our way in this new 
world of new politics he said 
dubcek who now serves as chairman of his countrys federal 
parliament said he hoped the 21st century would be one of 
maximum creativity and humanity 
i see the new century as one of great cooperation between 
nations a century marked by the melding of political systems 
dubcek was scheduled to receive a human rights award from an 
attorneys group tuesday

distributed 340000 food packets and sent hundreds of tankers 
filled with water to areas that were cut off from outside help for 
up to three days 
several villages remained marooned and navy craft still could 
not reach them news reports said hundreds of people were still 
being rescued from trees where they had taken refuge after the 
cyclone hit wednesday 
andhra pradeshs chief minister m chenna reddy described the 
situation along the coast as very bad 
the damage has been colossal he told reporters in 
hyderabad the capital of andhra pradesh 
in all he said 65 million people had been affected by the 
storm which at its peak tore into the farming region packing winds 
of up to 155 mph agricultural damage was estimated at 588 
million more than 100000 farm animals mainly goats cows and 
water buffaloes died in the disaster 
reports said sea water that contaminated all of the fresh water 
wells along the coast began to recede sunday but rain forecast 
for much of the region could set rescue work back said c arjun 
rao the top relief officer in andhra pradesh 
he said hundreds of trucks with bread and milk were being rushed 
to the hardesthit regions to feed thousands of people who had not 
eaten in three days in all 9100 gallons of milk had been 
distributed he said 
relief officials said the destruction of last weeks storm was 
worse than a 1977 cyclone that killed 10000 people at least 
434720 acres of rice paddies were rendered useless along with huge 
tracts of mangos and bananas 
the stench of dead livestock filled the air bloated bodies of 
cows and sheep filled farm yards and villages everywhere wrote 
the times of india 
appeals went out across the nation sunday for money for storm 
victims 
prime minister vp singh who made an emergency visit to the 
area saturday announced the release of 52 million to help in 
relief operations singh appealed to the public for clothes 
medicine and food and the government said families who lost 
relatives will get 1470 each 
cyclones are the indian equivalent of hurricanes and usually 
come in the spring just before the rainy monsoon season begins 
last weeks storm began tuesday when 33foothigh tidal waves 
and heavy rains bashed the coast of andhra pradesh and tamil nadu 
two southern indian states 
it reached its peak wednesday as it roared over the lowlying 
denselypopulated plain of fishing villages and rice paddies in 
andhra pradesh 
thousands of houses were flattened in the storm 
officials credited early satellite warning and the fast 
evacuation of 150000 people with keeping the death toll low 
compared with 1977 
most of the casualties occurred when houses mostly made of mud 
and straw collapsed some people were carried away by flooded 
rivers and others died when electrical wires tumbled down 
another 470000 people were evacuated from the coast and placed 
in 530 relief camps reports said

soldiers thwarted a coup attempt 
sunday by routing about 10 armed dissidents who seized the national 
radio station and declared the government overthrown three people 
were reported killed 
soldiers stormed the station in antananarivo the capital 
several hours after it was occupied and arrested the dissidents 
no fighting was reported elsewhere on the indian ocean nation off 
the east coast of africa 
hospitals reported at least three people died and 15 were 
wounded by bullets and grenades in the fighting between the rebels 
and troops government officials did not confirm the casualties 
it was the second time in two years that opponents of president 
didier ratsiraka had seized staterun radio madagascar ratsiraka 
has ruled since 1975 
the casualties appeared to occur in a crowd of 5000 people 
milling before the radio station troops fired tear gas to disperse 
them before storming the building about noon witnesses said it 
was not known whether the crowd supported the rebels or merely came 
to watch the confrontation 
the troops exchanged gunfire with the 11 rebels who were armed 
with automatic weapons pistols and knives witnesses said 
the director of the radio network said eight of his employees 
taken hostage were liberated by the troops no one died inside the 
station he said 
the dissidents claimed to be members of the previously unknown 
republican committee of public safety sources said their 
political beliefs were unknown 
gangs of youths roaming the streets later set two cars ablaze 
and hurled rocks through windows at the justice ministry and the 
american cultural center a us embassy official said on condition 
of anonymity 
there were two small display windows that were broken at the 
center the official said as far as we know it came from random 
widow breaking it wasnt directed against the american embassy or 
the cultural center 
no americans were injured the official said the center is 
about two miles across town from the radio station 
rebels seized the station at dawn sunday and a woman came on 
the air to call on the population to rise against the government 
she called for the populace to demand that retired gen jean 
rakotoharison an opposition figure be named the new president 
the broadcast was cut off after about 45 minutes and government 
forces surrounded the building witnesses said rakotoharison came 
to the station later and declined the offer the government 
announced before the building was stormed that the situation in the 
country was normal 
a madagascar opposition group based in paris claimed 50 people 
died in the clash between the rebels and soldiers but those 
figures were dismissed by a journalist on the scene as completely 
false 
the journalist said calm had returned to the area around the 
station 
on july 24 1989 six armed men took over the national radio and 
claimed the government had been toppled however the government 
recaptured the station and there was no violence elsewhere 
ratsiraka has led this country of 10 million people since he was 
installed by the military in june 1975

the bush administration indicated a 
willingness sunday to consider tax increases in a budget summit 
this week but only in exchange for a lineitem veto or other 
measures to give the president more direct control to cut federal 
spending 
we shouldnt consider a tax increase independently of major 
budget process reform white house budget director richard g 
darman said otherwise he said the money would be spent and it 
wouldnt reduce the deficit 
darmans comments on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
program were the first public affirmation by a top white house 
official that bush is willing to consider more taxes as part of his 
no preconditions pledge to congressional democrats 
but white house chief of staff john sununu who was chastised 
last week after commenting that bush would veto any tax increase 
said on cbstvs face the nation show sunday the administration 
is still likely to look askance at a tax hike 
darman tried to lower expectations on how big a 
deficitreduction package might emerge from the negotiations among 
26 top congressional and administration officials scheduled to 
begin tuesday 
acknowledging that government spending in fiscal 1991 now 
threatens to exceed revenues by 164 billion to 184 billion he 
said a realistic reduction in the size of that deficit without 
forcing the country into a recession would be 45 billion to 55 
billion 
the grammrudman law requires that the projected deficit going 
into the new fiscal year which begins oct 1 not exceed 64 
billion 
its not going to be sensible to try to contract that much in 
one year in a way that is consistent with continued economic 
growth darman said 
in addition to a lineitem veto repeatedly rejected by congress 
darman said the white house wants more authority to cut spending 
across the board long after a budget has been approved 
congressional democrats meanwhile continued to insist that 
bush go first in putting a tax increase on the table 
were not going to talk about raising taxes sen james 
sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget committee said on 
the abc program id like very much and i think the congress 
would like to see the presidents proposal for solving this 
problem 
darman said that because every solution is politically 
unpopular there is a reluctance by all sides to put anything 
higher taxes entitlement freezes spending cuts on the table 
the president could start with a moment of silence that could 
turn into an hour and half of silence he quipped eventually 
if people are there seriously and in good faith things manage to 
get on the table sometimes they get on there anonymously 
as examples darman cited south carolina democratic sen ernest 
f hollings suggestion for a valueadded tax and a package of 
spending and entitlement freezes coupled with higher tax rates for 
upper income earners suggested earlier by rep dan rostenkowski

thousands of weeping israelis gathered 
sunday at a cemetery where tombstones were marked with slogans 
calling on arabs to kill the jews and a jew from a nearby town 
was arrested as a suspect 
the desecration followed a similar act last week in the french 
city of carpentras where 34 graves were violated and the body of a 
man was dug up and mutilated 
about 10000 people gathered in carpentras in protest sunday 
and in paris jews clashed with rightwing extremists some minor 
injuries were reported but there were no arrests 
israeli police described the 41yearold man detained in the 
vandalism of 300 graves in haifa as eccentric 
the slogans were in black spray paint and in grammatical hebrew 
noam gabrieli a city official said on israel radio the 
language was not typical of palestinian leaflets distributed during 
the uprising in the occupied lands and may have been written by a 
mentally unstable person 
but haifa police chief yossi levi said investigators still could 
not determine whether the desecration was a political provocation 
the work of arab extremists or of a mentally disturbed person 
we do not exclude any direction of investigation levi said 
according to visual examination the writing seems to be done 
by one person but others may have accompanied or guarded him 
police department head avi tiller said police bolstered forces 
in the city to prevent possible vigilante reprisals and appealed to 
the public to show reserve 
riot police were also sent to the kfar samir cemetery to guard 
against violent demonstrations by thousands of bereaved relatives 
and other israelis who rushed there after the news was reported on 
the radio 
i cant believe this happened in a jewish state said sonia 
fuar pointing at the graves of her parents 
moshe ran a haifa restaurant owner wept beside the tomb of his 
son avi an israeli national goalkeeper killed in a 1987 boat 
accident on the sea of galilee kill the jews said a slogan 
written on rans tombstone 
the desecration was condemned by jewish and arab leaders alike 
and mayor arieh gurel called on haifa residents to keep calm 
this is a sick action from people who learned from the 
neonazis we will cut off the hands of those who did this gurel 
said 
he suggested the haifa incident was inspired by the desecration 
in carpentras four skinheads were detained in that case but later 
released 
the desecration in haifa apparently took place during the jewish 
sabbath when guards were not present 
yosef yisraeli whose mother and motherinlaw are buried in 
kfar samir said i saw the horrible sight and my blood boiled 
other slogans said moslem brothers destroy the jews and found 
palestine and called on arabs leaders such as iraqs saddam 
hussein to burn the jews 
wajdi tabari an israeli arab said the desecration was a very 
bad thing that would not help peace or coexistence 
i dont think a moslem would ever think to do something 
like this we respect graves and cemeteries very much in our 
religion tabari said 
haifa a port city in northern israel where 10 percent of the 
220000 population is arab has been symbol of arabisraeli 
coexistence despite the 29monthold palestinian uprising in the 
occupied gaza strip and west bank 
rightwing and ultraorthodox legislators blamed the attack on 
arabs 
what happened in haifa must return us all to our good senses 
to know with whom we are dealing and to stop fighting among 
ourselves and unite said rabbi moshe zeev feldman of the 
ultraorthodox agudat israel party 
in france the nations grand rabbi joseph sitruk led prayers at 
the cemetery in carpentras similar ceremonies were held in 
marseille lyon lille and drancy the nazi deportation center from 
where jews were taken to auschwitz 
in paris heavily armed riot police lined the streets of paris 
to enforce a ban on a parade by extreme rightwing groups but some 
skinheads demonstrated anyway and others passed out neonazi 
literature 
dozens of jewish militants armed with sticks and rocks attacked 
a group of skinheads outside the famed madeleine church in 
bayonne three leftist youths hurled eggs and rocks at 
rightwingers as they lay a wreath at a joan of arc statue

about 125000 farmers who under the 
former sandinista government received land confiscated from wealthy 
landlords will not give up their plots a newspaper said sunday 
on thursday the new government led by president violeta barrios 
de chamorro announced that landlords whose property was seized by 
the sandinistas will have six months to file claims 
she also said all unused agricultural and pasture land will be 
rented out on a provisional basis and a commission will study how 
much rent will be charged 
they would have to go over the cadavers of the cooperative 
members and small producers if the government tried to take back 
land according to daniel nunez president of the national 
agricultural workers union 
we will not allow the application of these laws which are 
totally against the people nunez said his comments were 
published in the prosandinista nuevo diario newspaper 
the usbacked mrs chamorro has said she will review all laws 
passed by the leftist sandinistas during their 10 years in office 
mrs chamorro who defeated daniel ortega in elections in february 
replaced him april 25 
the sandinistas handed out weapons among supporters before 
leaving office and mrs chamorro has ordered the military to take 
back those weapons 
some civilians began turning in their weapons over the weekend 
ninetynine farm workers turned over their rifles to authorities in 
la verbena about 180 miles southeast of managua on saturday 
nunez said 50000 farm union members will rally outside the 
presidential palace to protest mrs chamorros decree and demand 10 
percent of the 300 million in us aid earmarked for nicaragua be 
used for farm credits 
during its decade in power the sandinistas confiscated and gave 
away thousands of privately owned farms the sandinistas on 
saturday called mrs chamorros decrees dictatorial and 
unconstitutional 
the government has refused to give public employees a 200 
percent raise to make up for inflation government workers went on 
strike last week after rejecting a government offer of 60 percent 
among measures announced thursday mrs chamorro suspended a 
civil service law that protected employees from being fired and 
granted them the right to strike and bargain collectively she has 
said the country is virtually bankrupt

south african black nationalist leader 
nelson mandela on sunday defended his wife winnie saying she had 
been the victim of the most scandalous persecution by the 
government 
it was mandelas first comment on criticisms of mrs mandela 
one of whose former bodyguards is on trial in connection with the 
kidnapping and killing of a 14yearold black activist 
three men have testified they were abducted in december 1988 
along with the teenager and taken to mrs mandelas soweto house 
they testified she beat them with a whip and her fists and 
permitted her bodyguards to assault them 
the boy james stompie seipei was later found dead in a 
field 
mrs mandela has said she was not present during beatings she 
was ostracized for a time by some antiapartheid leaders over the 
activities of her bodyguards and questions over her own involvement 
a few months later however she resumed making joint 
appearances with other antiapartheid leaders and has been 
publicly at the side of her husband since his release from prison 
in february 
mrs mandela has not been charged in the case and both the 
prosecution and defense have said they would not call her to 
testify 
mandela made no specific reference to the allegations but he 
told a crowd of 30000 cheering nigerians even now as i am 
talking to you she is still being persecuted in south africa 
he said winnie mandela was the victim of the most scandalous 
persecution by the government and its agencies despite 
government restrictions on her activities during his 27 years in 
prison she fought back against all forms of injustice mandela 
said 
mandela thanked the nigerian government and people for support 
during his time in prison 
earlier in the angolan capital of luanda mandela urged the 
west not to end sanctions against south africa 
our policy is very clear we have called on the international 
community to isolate south africa and that is still our position 
mandela told a news conference ending a 3day official visit 
south african president fw de klerk is on a european tour 
during which he has been touting progress made in ending apartheid 
and arguing that it is time to end the diplomatic and economic 
isolation of south africa 
the south african government outlawed the african national 
congress in 1960 and the organization began a guerrilla campaign 
the following year to overthrow white minority rule and end the 
system of racial segregation 
de klerk legalized the anc in february and met with mandela last 
month delegations from the government and the anc reached a broad 
agreement to work for an end to political violence an prepare the 
way for black entry into government 
mandela indicated the anc was prepared to compromise with de 
klerk on several points but said demands for full voting rights 
were not negotiable 
the demand of one person one vote is one on which it is 
inconceivable to expect us to compromise he said what would 
this fight have been all about if we are not going to press that 
demand exactly as it is 
he promised the anc would work to address white fears about 
black suffrage 
we mean to remove any concerns because it is absolutely 
necessary for the future of south africa to retain white expertise 
and skill he said 
asked whether he intended to run for president in any future 
democratic elections in south africa the 71yearold activist said 
he had no such ambition 
but he said i will do what the anc and the south african 
people require me to do 
on his african tour mandela was also traveling to algeria 
libya egypt and possibly kenya

flooding forced more residents of lowlying areas to pack up and 
leave sunday in texas and louisiana and county jail prisoners and 
volunteers labored to reinforce levees with sandbags in arkansas 
a steady heavy downpour compounded the flood threat in 
louisiana and flooded streets throughout the new orleans area 
record flooding continued in texas where 7000 people had been 
urged to leave low communities along the trinity river the swollen 
red river continued to put pressure on levees in arkansas and its 
flood crest threatened communities downstream in louisiana 
oklahoma flood victims have begun cleaning up except around gorged 
lake texoma 
the leading edge of the flood crest on the trinity had reached 
lake livingston north of houston liberty county officials said 
sunday that water was pouring over the reservoirs spillway at a 
rate of 50000 cubic feet of water per second more than twice 
normal 
liberty county judge dempsie henley said officials expect the 
flow to double by tuesday he issued an evacuation warning urging 
7000 residents of communities downstream from the lakes dam to 
pack up and leave many roads in the area were already under water 
downstream at the town of liberty northeast of houston john 
burch and his family frantically packed clothes and supplies 
sunday they worked standing in water to avoid the many fire ants 
driven to high ground by water 
it hit us hard last year and its going to be worse this 
year said burch 32 last year i lost my home and ive got my 
trailer 3 feet higher than it was last year but i expect to lose 
it again 
burch said his fathers trailer is right on the bank of the 
trinity he said his father who doesnt want to leave until the 
last minute awoke to find water a foot deep around his home 
it doesnt bother me said bay burch 70 if it gets to 
where i get my feet wet ill leave 
but his 64yearold wife violet burch said he was depressed 
about losing their possessions last july they lost a back bedroom 
of their trailer to flood damage and had to replace walls floors 
furniture and clothing 
we dont have so much and he dont want to lose it she 
said 
along the texasoklahoma border on the headwarters of the red 
river only one highway in the lake texoma area remained closed 
sunday by record flooding that one week earlier had nearly cut 
marshall county off from the rest of the world the lake which had 
dropped nearly 5 feet by sunday had crested about 27 feet above 
normal and flooded homes and cabins and lakeshore recreation 
facilities 
in southwestern arkansas miller county prisoners joined 
volunteers and county personnel in sandbagging operations near the 
red river city of garland 
the levee had two major leaks friday and saturday but theyve 
been repaired and they are expected to hold said gary talley of 
the state office of emergency services the water is flowing 
under the levee and bubbling up on the other side theyre trying 
to stack sandbags to try to keep it contained but cant get 
sandbags where theyre needed because they cant get trucks in 
there 
officials asked that a borrowed texas national guard helicopter 
be diverted from hauling feed to cattle stranded by high water so 
it could be used to haul sandbags to garland 
the red river at garland was expected to rise a halffoot or 
more because of heavy rain in the area saturday talley said if 
the levee breaks about 250 to 300 homes would be affected in the 
town of 660 he said 
in neighboring hempstead county dynamite experts cleared trees 
in the river to enable a national guard barge to help feed and 
evacuate stranded cattle from islands of high ground along the 
river 
in nearby northeastern texas just north of texarkana emergency 
authorities pronounced the danger from the red river at bay sunday 
and said if no more rain falls in the coming days the area will be 
out of danger by tuesday or wednesday the river had dropped 2 feet 
since cresting wednesday 
but texarkana civil defense spokesman norman greer said between 
50 and 100 national guardsmen continued sunday to inspect the 
levees which were waterlogged and precariously soft 
were not letting anybody walk on them because the least 
little thing can set them to rolling greer said 
downstream on the red river in louisiana up to 600 square miles 
of land is expected to flood this week and next and up to a third 
of that will be farmland sen bennett johnston said sunday

event such as we have not experienced since 1945 the louisiana 
democrat said after meeting with army corps of engineers officials 
the river will flood winter wheat fields ready for harvest and 
soybean fields will be too wet to plant until june at least 
johnston said up to 500 homes and camps between the levees and the 
river will be inundated he said

colombia on sunday struggled through a 
mothers day shrouded by the grief of women who had lost children 
in a wave of car bombings blamed on drug traffickers 
six children were among at least 27 people killed in three car 
bombings saturday two of the attacks came in the capital of bogota 
and the other in the southern city of cali some 200 people were 
wounded 
the death toll was the highest this year for a single day of 
terrorist attacks police said they blamed all three of saturdays 
bombings on drug traffickers 
they were three almost identical attacks using car bombs 
detonated by remote control gen octavio vargas the polices 
chief of operations said in an interview with the rcn radio 
network 
the attacks were prepared by the same organization of drug 
terrorists accused in other bombings in recent months he said 
they targeted sites frequented by the civil population which 
has nothing to do with the drug trafficking problem vargas said 
in august the government announced an offensive against the 
traffickers following the assassination of presidential candidate 
sen luis carlos galan 
the drug cartels responded with an offensive of their own 
police blame them for hundreds of bombings and other attacks that 
have left nearly 300 people dead 
saturdays blasts caused thousands of dollars in damage and left 
the nearby streets a labyrinth of twisted metal rubble and bodies 
news accounts of the bombings were filled with descriptions of the 
cries of the wounded and the shock of the victims their loved ones 
bogotas el espectador newspaper told of a 9yearold girl 
angela gonzalez delgado who was helping her widowed mother sell 
flowers near the site of one of the car bombs in northwestern 
bogota 
they have destroyed my little baby said angelas mother 
cecilia delgado as she clasped her head and stared at the sheet 
covering the girls body on the street 
the girl was one of 17 people killed by the two bogota bombings 
targeting commercial sectors of the workingclass neighborhood of 
quirigua and the uppermiddleclass enclave of niza the health 
ministry earlier had said 19 people died in bogota but police on 
sunday corrected the total to 17 
the cars each packed with dynamite exploded as people shopping 
for mothers day filled the streets 
bogotas el tiempo newspaper described how another mother 
azucena de varela watched red cross workers pull the mutilated 
body of her 10yearold daughter carolina from the rubble 
dear god oh dear god it cant be the woman cried she 
was the only one i had and now she has been torn to pieces 
hours after the bogota explosions a 200pound car bomb went off 
in cali colombias thirdlargest city with 15 million inhabitants 
the explosion in a southern neighborhood in cali which came as 
couples were flocking to its bars and discos killed 10 people and 
injured 60 police said 
vargas the police chief of operations also said gunmen working 
for the drug chieftains have killed 11 police officers in the city 
of medellin since wednesday bringing to 80 the number of police 
officers slain in the city this year 
police have said the medellin cartel is paying more than 4000 
for every police officer killed for members of a special 
antiterrorist unit the bounty is 10000 they said 
vargas said the medellin cartel is apparently retaliating for 
the police manhunt for its leader pablo escobar who is believed 
to be hiding near medellin 
authorities said they have seized more than 19 tons of cocaine 
belonging to the cartel in the last 10 days with a street value of 
135 billion 
cartels in medellin and cali are responsible for most of the 
cocaine that enters the united states the us drug enforcement 
administration has said

solidarity leader lech walesa said sunday 
he was ready to do battle with former allies in the noncommunist 
government accusing them of being slow in carrying out economic 
and political reforms 
addressing the national citizens committee solidaritys 
political wing walessa said a fight was needed to stir up ideas so 
the government does not become too isolated from the people 
i know that i have offended a lot of people walesa said 
then added defiantly i would like to offend even more 
he said he had refrained from directly challenging the 
government led by prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki since it took 
office last fall because i was convinced that everything would go 
on all right 
today i return from this leave because i want to have a war 
a war that gives peace to the society at the bottom 
in a departure from the past mazowiecki did not attend the 
citizens committee session sending a curt twosentence note that 
said he had promised instead to attend a mass in krakow 
later at a meeting at a the nowa huta steel mill mazowiecki 
said the drive for reform including removal of former communist 
officials must be part of a peaceful transition 
we are aware of the existence of what one may call the hunger 
for justice he said we know that people are unwilling to look 
at those who are to blame at the same time there exists a need for 
security and calm 
walesa has pitted himself against what he calls the eggheads 
in warsaw saying they are not producing concrete results for 
poles who expect radical changes from economic and political 
reforms 
specifically walesa has criticized the government he helped 
create last august for its slow pace at privatizing the 
statedominated economy and for retaining communist holdovers in 
economic and government jobs 
underlying the dispute are hints by walesa reelected last 
month as chairman of the 2 millionmember trade union that he 
wants to be president of poland to help accelerate changes 
his former allies and advisers who now comprise the top echelons 
of government have received the notion cooly with suggestions 
walesa is too impulsive and lacks the cultured presence a president 
needs 
instead some parliament deputies are pushing mazowiecki as the 
proper successor to president wojciech jaruzelski the former 
communist leaders term lasts until 1995 but it is believed he 
will step down before then 
walesa did not mention any presidential ambitions at the meeting 
sunday but he made it clear he would not shirk from a fight 
my theory is short war at the top and peace at the bottom 
but if it is peace at the top then there will be war at the 
bottom he told the assembly at warsaw universitys main 
auditorium 
he said the government had been treating democracy as a 
steered process by telling poles things were bad but there were 
no alternatives and the helm was in the best hands 
the concept involves society too little this means it is 
not attractive for society he said 
walesa said he preferred a more freewheeling style of democracy 
in which individuals or groups could thrash out their differences 
through open debate 
i would like to encourage fighting which means allowing into 
the struggle all individuals who have something to say he said 
in my opinion this is what poland needs 
walesa told the audience he had been opposed in the past by the 
most prominent members of the solidarity movement mazowiecki and 
solidarity parliamentary leader bronislaw geremek but had been 
proved right 
walesa said it was he who persuaded mazowiecki to become prime 
minister and that mazowiecki originally opposed the idea of a 
solidarityled government walesa also said he begged geremek on 
my knees to become parliamentary leader 
the government has implemented a dramatic reform plan intended 
to create a marketoriented system out of polands failing 
socialist economy after rapid inflation prices are stablizing but 
real incomes have dropped an average of 40 percent by official 
estimates 
polls have indicated that the popularity of walesa and the 
government have slipped but they still have wide support and there 
have been no significant suggestions of alternative leaders or 
policies

end to the boycott in a televised speech friday called an 
impromptu news conference sunday to discuss the attack 
i didnt expect that i was going to make a speech on friday

four mohawk indians 
were arrested by canadian police sunday in an investigation of a 
killing linked to a tribal dispute over gambling on the reservation 
they were the first arrests in the killing one of two stemming 
from internal disputes on the reservation which straddles the 
uscanadian border 
the four were taken into custody for questioning by quebec 
provincial police sunday morning and no charges were immediately 
filed said police spokesman robert poeti they were taken to 
police headquarters in montreal he said 
the killings may 1 were blamed on factional disputes over 
reservation casinos that cater to outsiders and over who will run 
the reservation some mohawks reject outside jurisdiction on their 
land and us state and canadian provincial police have intervened 
rarely in violence there 
the warring factions have exchanged gunfire especially at 
barricades set up by antigambling forces to keep visitors away 
from the casinos 
the four men were questioned in the killing of harold edwards 
31 at one such barricade on the canadian side of the reservation 
an investigation continued into the shooting of matthew pyke 
22 who was killed in the same section of the reservation the same 
day the canadian police spokesman said 
pyke was said to oppose gambling some on the reservation have 
said edwards favored gambling but others dispute that 
since the killings canadian and new york state police have 
sealed off the reservation with roadblocks keeping nonresidents 
out and effectively closing the casinos along with many of the 
other businesses on mohawk land 
the reservation had been mostly peaceful since the police moved 
in after the killings the exception was a drug raid thursday by 
canadian officials who arrested 21 people and seized marijuana and 
cocaine worth 800000 in us currency

about 3000 union workers for cincinnati bell 
struck over health benefits early sunday leaving management 
personnel to run operations 
talks between locals 4400 and 4401 of the communications workers 
of america and cincinnati bell broke off after a 14hour session 
saturday the union declared a strike at 1240 am said mike 
timmerman local 4400 area vice president 
we have at least two people picketing outside bell garages and 
some offices but other than that we have no plans as far as i 
know no bargaining session has been called timmerman said 
clerical workers directory assistance operators splicers 
linemen installers and repair personnel are striking over health 
benefits and a plan that would require workers to pay part of their 
health premiums timmerman said 
though the walkout began on mothers day one of the busiest 
calling days of the year it didnt affect longdistance calls to 
mom said bell spokeswoman cyndi cantoni cincinnati bell isnt a 
longdistance carrier she noted 
dodie ditmer bargaining chairwoman for the cwa said in a news 
release that the union believes cincinnati bell came to the 
bargaining table intending to cause a work stoppage 
if cincinnati bell thought she could get health care 
concessions from cwa as a mothers day present she has dialed a 
wrong number ditmer said 
the union scheduled a meeting sunday afternoon with members to 
discuss the strike 
ms cantoni the spokeswoman said the company had agreed with 
union bargainers not to discuss the issues keeping both sides apart 
so we can bargain in good faith 
all i know is that the union does characterize health benefits 
as the main issue she said 
she said 1000 management workers were called in early sunday to 
take over jobs left empty by the strikers a total of 4150 people 
work for cincinnati bell 
they will fill in some of them putting in 12hour shifts for 
the duration of the strike she said i dont think customers 
will see a big difference in most services but they can expect 
slower response time from repair and installation 
the company serves more than 500000 customers in the cincinnati 
area and portions of northern kentucky and southeastern indiana 
cincinnati bell workers last struck in 1983 when management 
employees replaced union workers during a twoweek walkout

dozens of east german political prisoners may 
have been killed by guillotine at a nazi execution site between 
1952 and 1960 the director of a crematorium in dresden was quoted 
sunday as saying 
the state east german news agency adn said the director dietmar 
hildebrand uncovered evidence of up to 62 executions 
hildebrand who took over as head of the tolkewitz crematorium 
six months ago said he got the information from records kept by 
his predecessor 
east germanys authoritarian communist government was toppled 
last fall 
the crematorium directors suspicions were aroused when records 
that involved people who had supposedly died natural deaths also 
contained documents from the state prosecutors office the report 
said 
with typical german efficiency behind the name of each such 
record were the handprinted letters po in red ink indicating 
they were political prisoners adn said the prisoners cause of 
death was usually listed as heart failure hildebrand said 
hildebrand sought out witnesses to the sentencing and 
executions the report said he said doctors familiar with the 
prisoners fate told him the condemned were usually tied to a board 
without a blindfold placed under a guillotine and killed they 
were later cremated 
the doctors were not identified in the report 
the executions were carried out in the georg schumann building 
of dresdens technical university which was also used by the nazis 
for executions the report said it is now a memorial site to nazi 
victims 
hildebrand said he was going public with the information so 
those involved in the executions could be brought to justice 
after east germanys hardline government was overthrown 
relatives of some prisoners cremated at tolkewitz asked about their 
remains adn said 
other relatives whose property was seized by the state after 
their family members were sentenced as political prisoners are now 
seeking reparations the news agency said 
the list of names complied by hildebrand starts with a man who 
died on july 6 1952 the agency said it said the final listing 
was jan 15 1960

investigators have uncovered a 39state 
male prostitution ring they say was run by a navy computer expert 
that advertised via an electronic network and homosexual magazines 
the ring was organized by james william dayton a computer 
scientist at the naval avionics center in indianapolis who died of 
a heart attack march 16 marion county prosecutor steve goldsmith 
told the journalgazette 
at least 50 prostitutes and 300 patrons are involved police 
estimate no arrests have been made 
the rings clients and prostitutes included indianapolis banking 
executives a cincinnati priest and a marion county police officer 
the paper reported sunday the network drew clients and prostitutes 
from 39 states two canadian provinces south korea and guam 
investigators said 
goldsmith called it the largest prostitution ring hes seen 
adding there are so many names its so voluminous 
an fbi agent who answered the phone in the agencys indianapolis 
office sunday said the fbi has a policy against commenting on 
whether it is involved in investigations 
police had suspected dayton 44 of being involved in illegal 
sexual behavior as early as 1981 and had begun investigating an 
alleged prostitution ring in 1985 but met with deadends 
it was extremely difficult to infiltrate it had builtin 
barriers that prevented undercover officers from infiltrating the 
system said indianapolis police spokesman andrew stoner 
it was daytons death that allowed the case to be cracked 
stoner said 
dayton died in a tiffin ohio bed and breakfast after having 
sex with a man who wanted to join the network as a prostitute 
police said 
jim browning the seneca county sheriffs detective who 
investigated daytons death searched his car and found 140 pages 
of computergenerated job applications for two gay escort services 
that listed names addresses and phone numbers of men and photos 
of nude and partially clothed men 
browning notified indianapolis police who obtained warrants to 
search daytons indianapolis apartment there they found evidence 
of an intricate computerized system for matching male clients with 
male prostitutes 
don smith a computer expert at indiana universitypurdue 
university at indianapolis helped police break the codes to get 
access to that network 
he determined that dayton had used the computer signon blue boy 
and was the owneroperator of two gay escort services muscles usa 
and muscles midwest 
smith found that dayton sent this message through a computer 
network in april 1987 muscles usa is a nationwide service based 
in indianapolis which provides wellbuilt guys to 
welltodogentlemen we are now hiring the message promised at 
least 75 an hour more for body builders 
police learned that muscles usa and muscles midwest advertised 
in several homosexual mens magazines the ads gave tollfree 
numbers to call for information on gay escorts 
diana hogue director of public affairs for the naval avionics 
center said there is no indication dayton used computers at his 
job for the prostitution ring or that anyone else at the center was 
involved the center produces advanced electronics systems for the 
naval air systems command dayton did not have access to classifed 
data she said 
with dayton dead goldsmith said investigators will target the 
prostitutes were going to start with the most active ones and 
we will ask the patrons to cooperate

gov mike hayden signed a bill aimed at 
protecting farms ranches and research operations from 
animalrights extremists saying it was one of the first of its 
kind in the nation 
but the bill signed late saturday has been criticized by at 
least one humane organization that believes the legislation may 
hinder their efforts to protect animals from cruelty 
the farm animal and research facility protection act was in 
response to militant actions around the nation by some activists 
including vandalism and thefts of animals from farms or ranches and 
research operations 
it threatens up to 10 years in prison and a 10000 fine for 
each violation by those who enter farms ranches and research 
operations and damage property depending on the amount of damage 
hayden said sunday that kansas was one of the first states to 
pass legislation dealing with damage caused by radical elements of 
the animal rights movement 
the bill was backed by a number of farm groups including the 
kansas farm bureau 
but an amendment to the act prohibiting individuals from 
entering an animal operation to take pictures will hinder 
investigations into cruelty to animals said wendell maddox 
regional director for the humane society of the united states 
it takes away our power and authority to do something about 
cruelty problems he said last week in kansas city its more 
than obvious their intention is to keep us out of puppy mills 
the socalled puppy mills which raise puppies for sale have 
been criticized by animalrights groups for substandard conditions 
maddox said the farm animal act will make organizations such as 
his more dependent on assistance from law enforcement agencies 
law enforcement historically doesnt consider animal abuse a 
priority he said unless we gather evidence nothing gets 
done 
hayden said that before signing the bill he determined it did 
not conflict with local humane societies legal authority to deal 
with animal abuse including a law he signed two years ago aimed at 
stopping the unethical puppy mills in kansas 
i will continue to support efforts to close down these 
disgraceful operations the republican governor said 
the governor conceded that parts of the act may be considered 
unconstitutional and may be challenged in court but expressed 
confidence a followup bill cleaning up the measure will pass the 
legislature next year

president chaim herzog 
attended a west bank settlement celebration sunday despite appeals 
from israeli leftwingers who said his presence would send a 
wrong message to the world 
in other developments in the occupied lands sunday a jewish 
civilian critically wounded a 14yearold palestinian boy and 
palestinian uprising leaders issued a new leaflet calling for an 
escalation of their struggle 
elkana home to 3000 settlers was celebrating the 13th 
anniversary of its founding settlement leaders called the event a 
bar mitzvah referring to the ceremony marking a boys 13th 
birthday as the age of religious responsibility 
about 100 protesters from the leftist peace now movement lined 
one side of the street singing peace songs and holding lighted 
candles and signs reading stop the settlement 
a group of settlers across the street jeered at the protesters 
soldiers in battle gear separated the two groups 
tzali reshef a peace now leader argued herzog should not have 
come at a time when secretary of state james a baker iiis efforts 
to advance a dialogue between israel and the palestinians have 
bogged down 
at a time when israel refuses to give a positive answer to 
secretary baker when it refuses to continue the peace process it 
wants to show the world that it continues with the settlements and 
strengthening the existing settlements reshef said 
this is exactly the wrong message from israel the president 
should have sent a message of peace he said 
about 4000 settlers many carrying automatic weapons gathered 
at an auditorium decorated with blueandwhite israeli flags 
to my surprise demands have been raised that i refrain from 
visiting elkana herzog told the settlers i have made it clear 
in the past that i planned to visit every place in the country to 
which i am invited 
he said israeli citizens were divided on the question of the 
occupied territories and it must be decided by a democratic 
majority without political pressures 
shulamit aloni a leftwing legislator said herzogs visit may 
serve to legitimize the settlements at a time of growing friction 
between israel and the united states over settlement drive in the 
occupied territories 
israels caretaker government led by rightwing prime minister 
yitzhak shamir recently began construction of two settlements in 
the west bank and gaza strip it also provided funds for a 
settlement in the christian quarter of jerusalems old city 
the united states has voiced concern about the settlements 
contending that settlements in the occupied lands are an obstacle 
to peace in the middle east some 70000 settlers live amid 17 
million palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip areas 
captured by israel from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east 
war 
in the west bank town of qalqiliya an israeli motorist opened 
fire on stonethrowing palestinian youths critically wounding 
14yearold sameeh abu sheikh israel television and arab witnesses 
reported 
at least six palestinians were wounded in clashes with soldiers 
in gaza arab hospital officials said

a senior defense ministry official said sunday 
a police complaint would be filed against reserve col yair klein 
for holding unauthorized talks on the establishment of a military 
training camp in antigua 
however the official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the complaint did not link klein with israeli weapons sent to 
antigua for use at the camp and later diverted to a colombian drug 
trafficker 
also sunday a foreign ministry spokesman said israel regretted 
colombias decision to suspend a 28yearold agreement allowing 
israelis to enter the country without visas the colombian move 
friday was in protest of the weapons diversion 
we believe the decision is not justified or helpful and we are 
in contact with the foreign ministry of colombia in order to verify 
their position said the spokesman motti amihai 
israel radio said the complaint procedure against klein would be 
completed in several days when the defense ministry submits 
additional documents 
kleins attorney yigal shapiro said there was no clear legal 
precedent in some areas covered by the complaint 
we think that klein did not need an authorization to conduct 
the talks but this will be clarified by the court shapiro said 
shapiro also said antiguan investigators had promised klein 
immunity if he testified on the caribbean island about the israeli 
arms diversion 
the antiguans decided that if he came to antigua he would have 
immunity but they havent asked him to go yet shapiro said if 
they want klein to come we will go 
the fourmember antiguan investigating team headed by the 
nations envoy to the united nations patrick lewis questioned 
klein twice during a visit to israel last week 
klein says he tried to set up a training camp equipped with 
israeli weapons on antigua for panamanian rebels opposed to the 
rule of gen manuel noriega who was ousted by us forces in 
december 
the camp never went into operation and at least some of the 
weapons meant for it ended up in the hands of gonzalo rodriguez 
gacha a drug trafficker killed by colombian police in december 
the new york times had named klein and maurice sarfati an 
israeli owner of a produce business in antigua as responsible for 
the arms diversion 
sarfati who had acted as an envoy for the antiguan government 
in the deal was not questioned by the antiguan investigators 
sarfati is believed to be in switzerland 
israels foreign ministry said sunday that at the time of the 
weapons sale they had no proof that sarfati was an israeli citizen 
and are still doubtful 
colombian officials say klein is wanted for organizing training 
and equipping paramilitary groups he has been declared a fugitive 
from justice and may be tried in absentia in colombia

acrimonious political debate will be the 
price of hardwon freedom in eastern europe hungarys interim 
president told a commencement audience sunday 
hungary like other nations emerging from under communism must 
forge ties with its neighbors while maintaining good relations with 
the soviet union as well authorturnedpolitician arpad goencz 
said in his address at the butler university graduation 
political debate in hungary is framed by competition between the 
centerright hungarian democratic forum and the liberal league of 
free democrats goenczs party 
all thats happened in hungary is absolutely and finally 
irreversible goencz said the strength of hungarian democracy 
will take place as the result of very harsh debate between 
political parties 
goencz 68 was chosen hungarys interim president may 2 in the 
countrys first free elections in at least four decades he appears 
likely to be elected to the largely ceremonial post of president by 
parliament in early june 
we would like to introduce as soon as possible a freemarket 
economy and we hope to become fullscale members of the european 
economic community he said in a brief address he delivered the 
speech in english and spoke to reporters afterward through a 
translator 
goencz expressed concern for ethnic hungarians elsewhere in 
eastern europe particularly in romania hungarians were persecuted 
under romanias toppled ceausescu regime and are regarded with 
suspicion as that country struggles to form a new political system 
to guarantee collective and individual human rights for ethnic 
minorities outside our borders we have to maintain good 
neighboring relations he said we believe in transparency of 
borders so ethnic minorities outside hungary can enjoy the 
motherland 
goencz who was trained as a lawyer and entered politics after 
world war ii as a member of the thendominant smallholders party 
has written novels and short stories he headed the hungarian 
writers union since december 
he will meet with president bush and congress before returning 
to hungary he indicated economic aid for hungary will dominate his 
discussion with bush 
democracy in hungary will be very strong he said the 
first thing well need is private investment capital to go into 
hungary then we can make our own efforts to settle our own 
things 
when asked to name a dollar figure for the amount of aid he 
would seek from the united states goencz said laughing theres 
an old hungarian saying the upper limit is the sky to the stars 
but of course we shall pay back all that we receive 
maintaining neighborly relations with the soviet union is 
another priority goencz said 
we want to make a good connection to the soviet union he 
said adding i believe that success of the hungarian democracy 
will depend on its own and not on the fate of mr mikhail 
gorbachev 
goencz spent six years in prison on a life sentence for his role 
in the 1956 hungarian revolt he was released in a 1963 general 
amnesty 
the idea that he would receive an honorary degree from an 
american university was a source of delight to him 
really this whole event that i stand here now is so 
improbable that i cannot decide whether to drop a tear or to 
cheer he said in accepting his honorary doctorate of humane 
letters quite likely the proper behavior is to smile with 
happiness 
goencz was invited to speak at butlers commencement by his 
friend dr janos horvath a former member of the hungarian 
parliament and an economics professor at butler

mondello 19 was charged with two counts of seconddegree 
murder manslaughter and several other crimes

for a definition of discrimination charges and added we would 
also like to know if we could make mothers day calls 
you get your wish on both replied state supreme court judge

chancellor helmut kohls 
conservative party lost sunday to the leftleaning social democrats 
in a state election in lower saxony a setback that may complicate 
his goal for quick unification with east germany 
kohls governing coalition is expected to lose its slim majority 
in the upper house of parliament west german television reported 
citing nearly complete election returns 
the upper house or bundesrat acts only as a ratifying body for 
laws passed by the bundestag or lower house which is the main 
lawmaking body 
in the lower saxony elections the social democrats received 44 
percent of the vote to 412 percent for kohls christian democratic 
union based on the unspecified percentage of returns ard and zdf 
television said 
official results were not expected until monday but incumbent 
state gov ernst albrecht a member of kohls coalition conceded 
defeat on behalf of the governing coalition and said he would 
retire from politics kohl called the loss disappointing 
meanwhile in neighboring northrhein westphalia incumbent gov 
johannes rau a social democrat won reelection with 521 percent 
of the vote the returns indicated 
kohls coalition which includes the bavarian sister party 
christian social union and the centrist free democrats has only a 
oneseat majority 2322 in the bundesrat 
representation in the upper house and its fluctuating number of 
seats is determined based on the political makeup of west 
germanys 11 state governments 
with lower saxony now in the hands of the social democrats the 
leftleaning party is set to hold a 2318 majority edge over the 
conservatives and centrists 
the projected loss of seats by kohls party could cause 
complications for the chancellors goal of the quick unification of 
the germanys 
the defeat followed a loss for kohls coalition in january in 
saarland state where oskar lafontaine was reelected governor with 
more than 54 percent of the vote 
lafontaine is kohls top opponent in the national elections in 
early december 
kohl has been pushing for quick monetary economic and social 
union of the germanys by july 2 
however the social democrats have maintained the unification 
process has not been properly thought out and could lead to 
joblessness weakening of the west german mark and inflation 
hansjochen vogel the social democrats party chairman said 
kohl was being repaid for negotiating over the heads of the 
germans in the unification process and not sufficiently taking 
their concerns into consideration 
kohl acknowledged the defeat may have been generated in part by 
uncertainty of the costs of unification and blamed the 
leftists for fear campaign tactics 
the states winner social democrat gerhard schroeder was 
quoted as saying he plans to talk with the environmentalist greens 
and the centrist free democratic party about a coalition 
free democrat national chairman otto lambsdorff said before the 
two state elections that his party would not enter a coalition with 
the social democrats 
the greens and the free democrats each received about 6 percent 
of the vote according to tv reports

at this weekends prom but the schoolsponsored event may have 
been the last because the us supreme court has approved a 
nodancing rule

dance after the prom some students enjoyed pizza and bowling at a 
local bowling alley said physical education teacher becky woods

the dance had been scheduled before the supreme court ruling 
the board had promised students it wouldnt cancel their plans 
regardless of how the court ruled ransom ellis iii attorney for 
the school board said sunday

four years ago to try to overturn the ban which has divided 
students and residents in this town of about 900 people 
the ban on dancing at purdy high which has an enrollment of 
about 230 paralleled the film footloose the movie centered on 
a fight in a fictional small town between young people and city 
fathers who thought dancing sinful and immoral 
the supreme court rejected arguments that purdys ban was 
religiously motivated and violated the separation of church and 
state 
opponents say they hope the school board will voluntarily lift 
the ban but officials have declined to discuss the issue 
school board president glenn garrett and member alan keeling 
reached at home sunday refused to comment school superintendent

soviet ambassador yuri dubinin told george 
washington university students sunday the class of 1990 is entering 
a unique world which is changing rapidly as never before 
perhaps a soviet ambassador has more reason to say that since 
in my country a week and sometimes a day brings changes which 
otherwise would have taken years dubinin said at commencement 
ceremonies for the universitys elliott school of international 
affairs 
but he said the rapid rate of change is also true of 
international relations in europe and worldwide 
the speech was dubinins last scheduled formal public appearance 
in washington before his departure to become the soviet unions 
ambassador to france 
dubinin who has headed the soviet embassy here since 1986 is 
being succeeded by aleksandr a bessmertnhkh currently the soviet 
unions first deputy foreign minister and a veteran expert on us 
affairs us officials have said bessmertnykh who served in 
washington from 1970 to 1983 is considered especially close to 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
perhaps for the first time mankind now has a chance to rid 
itself of the ideological political and military confrontation 
among states in order to address the problems which call for joint 
efforts said dubinin 
turning to ussoviet relations in particular dubinin said 
they have become a proving ground for innovative approaches to 
world affairs 
over the years our best political minds thought of ways to 
deceive or defeat the enemy now we are learning to think about 
each other not as adversaries but as partners indeed at the 
malta summit president mikhail gorbachev said that the soviet 
union no longer regarded the united states as its enemy 
a new closeness is how president bush described our 
relationship 
never has there been a more productive period of 
sovietamerican interaction as in recent years he continued 
we have come to trust each other enough to reveal our military 
bases and hardware we have started to destroy the most 
sophisticated nuclear weapons turning disarmament from a utopia 
into reality 
i am sure that the summit between president gorbachev and 
president bush coming up in just two weeks on american soil will 
become a major step in the process of bringing our two nations 
closer together and will prove to be an outstanding event of 
international life

while militant jews clashed with skinhead extremists in paris 
grand rabbi of france joseph sitruk led prayers at the cemetery 
in carpentras where 34 jewish graves were vandalized last week 
the corpse of a recently buried 81yearold man was impaled on an 
umbrella 
from now on there will always be before and after 
carpentras sitruk told the crowd that included four government 
ministers this day will stay a historic date for our country 
sitruk asked pardon for the desecrators and called on france to 
remember that a democracy doesnt exist by the grandeur of its 
principles but by the obsessive quest for the truth 
the demonstration came hours after reports that vandals 
desecrated 300 jewish graves in haifa israel with spraypainted 
slogans calling on arabs to kill the jews 
residents of this southern french town site of a jewish 
community for 2000 years observed 15 minutes of silence during 
the ceremony shops closed their shutters and motorists stopped 
their cars

jews on rail cars for transport to auschwitz 
at noon the bells of the roman catholic cathedral rang out in 
mourning the synagogue opened for a special service dedicated to 
those whose graves were violated 
interior minister pierre joxe called on french citizens to 
remember the founding principles of their republic 
we will act in all areas to protect france and all those who 
live here said joxe who has accused farright politician 
jeanmarie le pen of indirect responsibility for the desecration by 
creating an atmosphere of racial hatred 
le pen favors expelling frances 34 million moslem immigrants 
and once termed the nazi holocaust a detail of history 
four members of le pens national front party attended the 
ceremony at the invitation of jewish leaders 
antiracist groups trade unions and political parties plan 
another rally monday in paris 
police sent out an appeal for witnesses to assist their 
investigation of the carpentras desecration five skinheads were 
held for questioning in the crime friday and saturday but all were 
released 
skinheads in france generally sympathize with neonazi or 
neoroyalist groups and generally have shaved heads or 
closedcroped hair and wear bomber jackets and steeltoed boots

ourside the jail which holds more than 300 prisoners awaiting 
court proceedings police blocked off crumlin road while prison 
staff tried to negotiate an end to the disturbance the northern

many of the prisoners are linked to the outlawed irish republcan 
army which is overwhelmingly catholic or to outlawed protestant 
paramilitary groups who want to remain under the british flag 
both sides have long made demands for segregation which the 
northern ireland office rejects because it fears the prisoners 
would effectively run the jail

the prison and the cars and homes of staff have been attacked 
sometimes with gasoline bombs

an ohio congressman said hes urging a 
retired nasa rocket scientist accused of brutalizing nazi prisoners 
during world war ii to return to this country from germany in 
defiance of a justice department order 
rep james traficant said 84yearold arthur rudolphs return 
would force the justice departments nazihunting office of special 
investigations to prove the scientist mistreated slave laborers at 
a nazi rocket factory 
they may put him in jail they may put me in jail for helping 
him but thats what i intend to do the maverick ohio democrat 
said saturday at a dinner attended by about 140 supporters and 
former colleagues of rudolph 
the 20aplate event was held to raise money for a possible 
legal fight by rudolph who surrendered his american citizenship 
and left the united states in 1984 under an agreement with the us 
government 
rudolph who lives in hamburg west germany has yet to say 
whether he will return 
office of special investigations director neal sher said last 
year that he would fight any attempt by rudolph to return for a 
court hearing 
this northern alabama city is home to the national aeronautics 
and space flight centers marshall space flight center where 
rudolph and other scientists who worked on nazi rocket weapons 
developed rockets that put americans on the moon 
sher has described rudolph who said he belonged to the nazi 
party as a selfconfessed war criminal but traficant claims an 
army investigation absolved rudolph of war crimes in 1947 
the congressman said saturday that he is not defending nazi war 
criminals and should not be considered antisemitic 
if i thought arthur rudolph was a nazi war criminal i could 
pull the switch myself but thats not what he is he said 
traficant has defended john demjanjuk a retired cleveland auto 
worker on death row after being convicted of nazi atrocities the 
congressman has sharply criticized the office of special 
investigations for trying to discredit some witnesses in the 
demjanjuk case 
traficant on saturday accused a powerful jewish lobby of 
trying to intimidate elected officials who might otherwise agree 
with his claim the case against rudolph lacks merit 
the jewish groups that support the osi should consider that if 
we let this government violate the rights of an old nazi who is not 
a criminal they could just as easily violate the rights of jewish 
americans he said 
stuart lewengrub southeast director of the antidefamation 
league in atlanta criticized the congressman 
the manner in which congressman traficant addresses the issue 
blaming the jewish lobby belies his own denial of 
antisemitism lewengrub said in a telephone interview from his 
home saturday night 
lewengrub said the case against rudolph was overwhelming and 
said his attack on the jewish lobby was as insidious as his 
defense of proven nazi war criminals 
lewengrub said many of those petitioning for rudolphs return 
probably arent motivated by antisemitism 
rudolph arrived in huntsville after world war ii with the 
wernher von braun rocket team they built missiles for the army and 
then for nasa rudolph became manager of the saturn v rocket 
program that first sent astronauts to the moon in 1969 
most of the scientists including rudolph retired in the late 
1960s

king birendra agreed sunday to reconsider 
the makeup of a constitutional commission he had appointed without 
consulting the government sparking an outcry 
a highranking government official said sunday that police fired 
on a group of students in baglung 118 miles northwest of the 
capital killing one and injuring two 
the students were protesting the transfer of a police officer 
who they said was involved in the repression of the prodemocracy 
movement earlier this year the official said 
on april 6 police fired into a crowd of prodemocracy activists 
marching to the palace and witnesses said at least 200 people were 
killed 
popular pressure then forced king birendra to lift a 29yearold 
ban on political parties dismiss a rubberstamp government and 
disband a partyless system of government known as the panchayat 
the king had come under sharp criticism from members of the 
interim government for appointing a sevenmember constitutional 
commission without consulting the government that was seen as an 
attempt on the monarchs part to head off limits on his sweeping 
powers under the constitution 
the king formed the commission friday saying it would rewrite 
the document to institutionalize a constitutional monarchy and a 
multiparty system 
prime minister krishna prasa bhattarai one of the leaders of 
the democracy movement said he was shocked by the kings failure 
to consult the government about the appointments 
however the king reportedly assured the prime minister that any 
draft of the constitution would be sent to the cabinet for 
revisions 
bhattarais government took office april 19

was long overdue 
somebody is going to come along every time and break some 
tradition thats really stupid some tradition you dont really 
think about because youve always done it said hope bickley a 
white 17yearold im glad it was our class that broke it 
ms bickley and ato crumbly a black student are friends who 
have known each other since elementary school and march together in 
the school band but although crumbly said blacks and whites get 
along fairly well at school theyd never had an integrated prom 
we go to school together play football together run track 
together so why cant we socialize together crumbly said 
saturday at the formal dance in the school gym 
i go out of town a lot in the summer to las vegas and 
california he added id tell friends about the prom and 
theyd say what and theyd ask do yall still have to drink 
out of separate fountains 
all school dances and parties were canceled by the peach county 
school board in the early 1960s when a student apparently was 
injured during a prom board members also said planning the dances 
took time away from schoolwork 
without a schoolsponsored prom parents began organizing their 
own one for blacks one for whites 
but three years ago peach countys parentteacher group the 
better schools association tried to change the boards policy the 
board promptly rejected their request for an integrated prom 
last year the board changed its position and saturdays prom 
was held without incident 
this prom crumbly said will be a good experience 
susan jordan president of the parentteacher organization said 
the students set an example for their community 
a child shall lead them she said quoting the bible 
well in this case a group of children shall perhaps lead the 
community and wont that be great and isnt it about time

this brutal and clumsy attempt to drive a wedge between the 
united states and the philippines will fail chief us 
negotiator richard armitage said before the talks began

lawlessness and banditry of the insurgents blamed by 
authorities for the killings the area near the usrun clark air 
base has been a communist stronghold since the 1940s

john h raven and airman james c green they were assigned to the 
8th aircraft generation squadron on temporary duty here from kunsan 
air base 110 miles south of seoul south korea 
their hometowns and ages were not immediately released by the 
air force but philippine police said earlier that raven was 21 and 
green 22

communist rebels

airmen were waiting for a cab on samson street near clark when two 
or three filipinos approached and shot them in the back of their 
heads with 45caliber pistols the rebels often use such guns in 
street attacks and fire at close range

raul manglapus and armitage who arrived sunday from japan 
the talks are considered an exploratory phase after which 
the two sides will decide whether to enter formal negotiations

agree to extend the lease for the bases among the largest outside 
the united states

spell out what her government would demand as the price for 
allowing them to stay

friendly relations with the united states keeping in mind that any 
friendship must be based on respect for each others rights and 
adherence to principles mrs aquino said

spearfish watertown and yankton in south dakota 
you cant ignore them says doug nelson who owns a small 
womens clothing store in williston were taking steps to live 
with them until theyre no longer the new kids on the block 
nelson will be joining other small businesses in the two states 
trying to disarm the consumer attraction to a national powerhouse 
with discount prices 
some merchants are following the advice of steve torok an 
assistant professor of agribusiness at the university of wyoming 
torok gives lectures to communities preparing for walmarts 
arrival 
to survive familyowned businesses need to tout their customer 
service longer hours flexible return policies and a friendly 
smile he says 
walmart wont be able to know people on a firstname basis 
and small businesses can torok says its free to do and it 
really really will pay off 
a smile may not be enough an iowa state university study shows 
that after four years in a town willistons size walmart takes 
83 million from local businesses 
the same study shows however that the store is more likely to 
attract shoppers from a wider area bringing a new batch of 
spendthrifts who didnt come before 
richard stone an economics professor who conducted the study 
has given lectures in five south dakota towns awaiting walmarts 
he says the biggest fears are based on rumors 
its worse here because they really dont know what the 
stores about stone says its fear of the unknown more than 
anything else 
gary blythe executive vice president of the aberdeen area 
chamber of commerce says business owners have different opinions 
about the walmart moving into town depending on what kind of 
store they own 
overall the business communityi think they are excited 
about this development he says but at the same time there is 
some concern 
just ask marc feinstein who owns a womens clothing store in 
downtown aberdeen 
i guess its a free market they have every right to be here 
but i dont think the governing bodies understand whats 
happening he says i really question whether some of the 
people interested in some of this growth realize if its really 
growth or just replacement 
the business that walmart will take business away from local 
retailers hurting the aberdeen economy and benefitting walmart 
headquarters in arkansas feinstein says he also claims walmart 
has a competitive edge because some of the local taxes it will pay 
will be earmarked for parking and improvements that can benefit the 
store 
walmart counters that it brings about 235 jobs to an 
averagesized store circulating payroll dollars into the community 
there are many paybacks to having a walmart in a community 
says public relations coordinator jane arend aside from hiring 
area residents the store gives scholarships and donates to 
charities 
some residents are concerned about what walmart will do to 
their neighborhoods people in minot asked last week for a fence 
between their neighborhood and the store to improve scenery and to 
prevent shoppers from tromping through yards to get to walmart 
williston business people remain optimistic however they see 
walmart as a boon for the economy and a chance to attract more 
people 
were just so ready for something new and exciting to 
happen says nikki roberts a shoe store manager things have 
been on the down side for so long this is a big plus for us its 
drawing more people into town they cant spend all their hours in 
walmart 
adds nelson living through the drought has been more 
devastating to our community than any new walmart or supermarket 
will be

a former exxon corp manager says company 
officials received gifts and trips in exchange for awarding 
lucrative charterboat contracts last year as part of the cleanup 
of the catastrophic oil spill in alaska 
the manager bill alexander says he believes he was fired for 
telling company officials during an internal probe that some 
employees had received gifts and favors the seattle times reported 
sunday he did not acknowledge having done so himself 
i owned up said alexander 42 of baton rouge la i 
cooperated fully with the investigation i told them what i knew 
and maybe others didnt 
officials of new yorkbased exxon denied alexanders allegations 
of widespread kickbacks the newspaper reported 
alexander a 15year exxon employee was made marinecontract 
administrator at valdez alaska three days after the exxon valdez 
ran aground in prince william sound in march 1989 spilling 11 
million gallons of crude oil 
the practice of trading charter contracts for favors was 
widespread and pretty flagrant during the disorganized early 
days of the cleanup alexander said 
a lot of people were getting a lot of stuff there were trips 
hunting and fishing merchandise was passed out he said rules 
were tightened and the practice tapered off later he said 
alexander said he gave internal investigators the names of 
people involved he said that he did not accept any merchandise 
himself but would not say whether he had accepted anything else 
the times reported 
in anchorage exxon spokeswoman jan cool refused to confirm 
whether alexander had been fired saying personnel records are 
confidential but she said if anyone was found to have taken gifts 
in violation of company policy appropriate action would be taken 
one would hope our people wouldnt take advantage of another 
persons desperation to get a job she said 
alexander was suspended april 3 from his job in valdez and fired 
april 10 the seattle times said 
on april 25 exxon sent a letter to its contractors and 
suppliers saying company ethics policies would be enforced strictly 
and asserting exxons right to audit their records the times 
reported 
the letter noted employees could not accept offers or gifts in 
excess of a nominal value or offers of boating fishing or 
hunting activities 
jim lewis an internal auditor for exxon in anchorage said the 
timing of the letter was a coincidence 
he said the internal probe stemmed from a much broader audit of 
how our overall business was being conducted in valdez 
he said he looked into contracting procedures and alexanders 
relationship with suppliers 
lewis refused to say whether alexander or others received favors 
from boat owners but said he submitted a report of his 
investigation of alexander to gus elmer president of exxon 
shipping co last month 
elmer could not be reached for comment and exxon officials in 
houston declined comment the times reported calls made by the 
associated press sunday to exxon shipping and to exxons corporate 
headquarters went unanswered 
lewis said he did not know whether exxon planned further action 
i do know our lawyers have been consulted on this lewis 
said 
after the spill exxon chartered hundreds of vessels ranging 
from small local fishing boats at 1000 or more a day to a 
350foot factory ship chartered for 480000 a month
