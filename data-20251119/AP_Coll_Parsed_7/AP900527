police units saturday prevented contra 
rebel leaders from leaving two hotels where they came to negotiate 
their disarmament with the government one contra leader said they 
were being held hostage 
later in the day members of a government investigative team 
announced they found no proof of contra claims that the army 
massacred 14 rebels who had laid down their weapons 
contra leaders broke off the disarmament talks with the 
government on friday demanding an investigation of the purported 
army massacre of the rebel fighters and 100 civilians may 18 near 
waslala in matagalpa province 150 miles northeast of managua 
contra commander oscar sovalbarro was named to the commission 
created friday but he remained in managua on saturday in a hotel 
where he said he and 18 other contras were being held hostage 
by police 
sovalbarro said 10 other contra leaders were prevented from 
leaving another managua hotel he said the rebels were considering 
a hunger strike in protest 
the police who surrounded the managua hotels did not appear to 
be threatening the rebels but contra leaders said they were told 
they could not leave the hotel grounds 
presidential spokesman danilo lacayo and interior minister 
carlos hurtado told the associated press that police had been 
placed at the hotel for the contras own protection 
the leftist sandinistas who turned over power to president 
violeta barrios de chamorro last month after losing february 
elections still control the military and police 
sovalbarro also known as commander ruben said saturdays 
police action showed the contras have a good reason not to trust 
the government 
he spoke from the garden of the hotel mercedes where about two 
dozen police from the elite black beret unit were seen patrolling 
the investigative commission named by mrs chamorro traveled 
saturday by helicopter to the area of the purported massacre and 
interviewed army and rebel leaders said santiago murray 
representative of the un international support and verification 
commission at a news conference later in the day 
we havent been able to confirm the existence of any dead 
alleged by the nicaraguan resistance he said 
he said the commission members found no information about any 
dead or other serious incident 
people interviewed near waslala in the community of zinica 
where rebels alleged the incident occurred seemed surprised by 
news of a massacre and said they had heard about it from a managua 
radio station 
the investigating commission consisted of government delegates 
un officials roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo and a 
contra representative 
a may 4 agreement between the contras and the chamorro 
government set a june 10 deadline for more than 11000 rebels to 
surrender their weapons 
but on may 19 the contra high command suspended the 
disarmament claiming authorities were not providing enough food 
housing jobs and security measures for fighters who lay down their 
arms 
only 1404 of the rebel fighters have been demobilized the 
government said 
the usbacked contras fought the sandinista government in a 
10year war that left 30000 dead 
the rebel fighters said they would give up their arms after mrs 
chamorro also backed by the united states took over the 
presidency from sandinista president daniel ortega on april 25 
the contras say their chief concern is that the army is 
controlled mostly by sandinistas

burmese voted sunday in the countrys 
first multiparty election in 30 years but the military regime has 
kept some opponents out of the campaign and other groups were 
boycotting the balloting 
prodemocracy forces hope the elections for a national assembly 
will pave the way for an end to military rule but some analysts 
question whether the military intends to yield any real power to 
liberal forces 
in rangoon the capital thousands of burmese lined up outside 
schools and government buildings before the polls opened at 6 am 
there were no immediate reports of any disturbances and troops 
kept largely out of sight 
gen saw maung the head of the ruling military council said he 
was ready to step aside for a civilian government 
i have already abided by my promise and am going back to the 
barracks maung told reporters after casting his ballot in 
downtown rangoon 
i will transfer power according to the law 
he said the timetable for a transfer to civilian rule would 
depend on the political parties in the national assembly the 
military has promised to step down from power when the parliament 
puts together a new constitution a process that could take several 
years 
an official at the headquarters of the national league for 
democracy the main opposition group said the voting appeared to 
be proceeding well 
the election is going smoothly right now said the official 
who requested anonymity in a telephone interview there is no 
problem right now 
the countrys three most popular opposition leaders were barred 
from a role in the campaign and western diplomats human rights 
groups and others have expressed concern over widespread arrests 
intimidation of party workers and martial law restrictions 
a welter of ethnic minority groups and student dissidents are 
boycotting the election 
but on saturday rebel sources in bangkok thailand said they 
had called off earlier plans to sabotage polling even though they 
regard the election as fraudulent 
the ruling military council has pledged that voting will be fair 
and free in recent days it eased restrictions on campaigning 
two years ago huge street demonstrations in rangoon were 
brutally crushed by military force 
in public there were few of the trappings of a westernstyle 
election campaign political posters were banned except at party 
headquarters government signs urged people to obey the law to 
ensure a fair election 
the rangoon government closed off the country to tourists and 
rejected requests from several human rights and legal organizations 
to monitor the election 
however last week it granted visas to about 60 journalists from 
the united states western europe and elsewhere in asia 
journalists were told their coverage would not be restricted 
except for a ban on entering polling stations 
results from rangoon are expected to be released by monday 
morning but a final tally will not be available for up to three 
weeks due to difficulties in obtaining results from remote rural 
areas 
predictions about the outcome range from a substantial victory 
for the democratic parties to a fractured vote that could lead to 
continued military domination 
prodemocracy parties hope to return to a liberal multiparty 
government abolished by the military in 1962 the conservative 
national unity party stands for the status quo 
parties have been vague on specific political and economic 
issues criticism of the military was forbidden during campaigning 
and discussion of other topics was restricted as well 
about 21 million people are eligible to vote in the elections 
choosing 492 parliamentarians from among 2297 candidates voting 
has been postponed in seven constituencies due to security and 
communications problems 
burmas three bestknown opposition figures were sidelined 
during the campaign 
aung san suu kyi daughter of independence hero aung san was 
placed under house arrest last july retired gen tin oo is serving 
a threeyear jail term former prime minister nu who presided over 
chaotic experiment in democracy during the 1950s is under house 
arrest 
ms suu kyi and tin oo headed the national league for democracy 
the countrys most popular party it faces off against the 
conservative national unity party successor to the promilitary 
burma socialist program party which wielded power for a quarter 
century 
although 93 parties have entered the contest only some half 
dozen are expected to make any substantial showing 
these include the league for democracy and peace backed by nu 
the union nationals democracy party of aung gyi thu wais 
democracy party and the democratic front for national 
reconstruction headed by onetime leftist leader chit maung 
the national unity party has an efficient and wellfinanced 
machine but is handicapped by the ruinous record of its predecessor 
and popular resentment of the military following the bloody events 
of 1988 
the national league for democracy has been weakened by internal 
feuding the loss of its top leadership and arrests of its 
supporters and candidates suu kyis downfall came when she 
publicly criticized ne win burmas strongman between 1962 and 1988 
burma a nation of 41 million has suffered from political 
turmoil and civil war since its independence from great britain in 
1948 when many regarded it as a future asian dynamo 
a period of flawed democracy but relative economic prosperity 
was followed by a 1962 coup led by ne win and a failed experiment 
in mixing military control socialist economics and international 
isolationism 
the resourcerich country is now among the worlds poorest a 
major drain on the economy has been a decadeslong war between the 
central government and a dozen ethnic minority groups demanding 
greater autonomy

columbia will be making the first 
shuttle flight in five years devoted entirely to scientific 
research when it lifts off this week on a mission to study the 
stars a comet and other celestial matter 
launch is set for 1238 am edt wednesday two weeks later than 
planned because nasa had to replace a bad cooling valve in 
columbias payload bay 
it looks very good there have been ups and downs a lot so 
everybodys very excited about the prospects of getting this 
mission off mission manager jack jones said friday 
the countdown for launch began on schedule at 1 am sunday a 
nasa spokesman said 
columbias payload a 150 million observatory called astro 
will provide a much more thorough study of ultraviolet light than 
the hubble space telescope placed in orbit a month ago during the 
last shuttle flight astro also will probe xrays invisible to 
hubble 
we selected astro to fill in the holes so to speak 
explained ed weiler a program scientist for the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
it will be the first mission since 1985 to use spacelab a 
scientific research facility carried in the shuttles payload bay 
it also will be the first of five spacelab missions dedicated to a 
single subject astrophysics 
the four astronomers on board will operate astro from the rear 
flight deck using spacelab computers a pressurized laboratory 
module in which astronauts conduct experiments will not be used 
other spacelab components will support the 27450pound observatory 
in the open payload bay 
it will be the first of 36 shuttle missions to offer lessons 
from space more than 40 middleschool students at two nasa 
centers will question the astronauts through a twoway audio and 
video link 
and it will be the first time direct radio communication is made 
between a us and soviet spacecraft columbias astronauts plan to 
talk by ham radio to two cosmonauts aboard the soviet space station 
mir 
during the nine to 10day mission 218 miles above earth 
astros four telescopes will make nearly 1000 observations of up 
to 230 sources of ultraviolet and xray radiation short 
highenergy wavelengths absorbed by the atmosphere 
at least four observations are planned of comet austin making 
whats believed to be its first journey through the solar system 
halleys comet would have been studied if astro had gone up as 
planned in march 1986 the challenger accident two months earlier 
postponed the mission 
astronaut samuel durrance a research scientist at johns hopkins 
university said its hard to predict what astro might uncover on 
its first outing but he added every time we point the 
telescopes it could change the way astronomers think 
unlike hubble a 15 billion observatory astronomers hope will 
explain how and when the universe was created astro wont be 
focusing on any mindboggling question said astronaut ronald 
parise a scientist at computer sciences corp in silver spring md 
the hopkins ultraviolet telescope developed by johns hopkins 
university will examine ultraviolet wavelengths some of which 
have never been studied in detail it will observe the hottest 
stars and seek traces of helium 
the ultraviolet imaging telescope developed by nasas goddard 
space flight center in greenbelt md will provide wideangle 
photographs of the sky images will be recorded on film which will 
be developed following the mission 
much of what is seen eventually will be examined in greater 
detail by hubbles telephoto eye 
uit sees the forest hubble studies the trees weiler said 
the wisconsin ultraviolet photopolarimeter experiment wuppe 
for short pronounced whoopee will measure the brightness and 
orientation or polarization of ultraviolet light from stars 
polarization measurements in the ultraviolet have not yet been 
done said arthur code the telescopes principal investigator 
i think were going to have a lot of interesting data to really 
say whoopee 
because of their complexity the ultraviolet instruments will be 
operated by durrance and parise the first payload specialists 
since challenger exploded and mission specialists robert parker 
and jeffrey hoffman the men will split 12hour shifts 
astros fourth scientific instrument is the broad band xray 
telescope a goddard project operated by computer commands sent 
from there it will probe the elusive spectrum of xrays and track 
remnants of exploding stars or supernovas 
so as not to disturb the telescopes pointing systems columbia 
commander vance brand and pilot guy gardner will do their treadmill 
exercises one of several medical experiments when no 
observations are being made and none of the crew is sleeping

the supreme court sunday rejected former 
nuclear technician mordechai vanunus appeal of his conviction for 
treason and espionage resulting from his leaks about israels 
nuclear weapons program to a london newspaper 
the threejudge panel announced their decision but it was read 
behind closed doors in keeping with the secrecy surrounding 
vanunus case since he was arrested in 1986 after disappearing in 
london 
the judges did not make public their reasons for rejecting the 
appeal 
the case received international attention because vanunu claimed 
he had been drugged and kidnapped by israeli agents just before 
publication of articles in the sunday times of london based on his 
disclosures 
the newspaper reported that israel had stockpiled 100 nuclear 
weapons and had the ability to make atomic neutron and hydrogen 
bombs it said this arsenal made israel the worlds sixth largest 
nuclear power 
israel has never responded directly to allegations about its 
nuclear capacity but has said it will not be the first country to 
introduce atomic weapons into the middle east 
israeli officials refused to disclose how vanunu was brought to 
israel but said no british laws were broken 
vanunus brother meir said vanunu was lured from london to 
rome by an american woman who promised him sex in rome he was 
abducted by israeli agents and spirited home meir said 
vanunu 36 a former technician at israels nuclear facility in 
dimona was convicted in march 1988 and sentenced to 18 years in 
prison 
in his appeal vanunu maintained that speaking to a newspaper 
does not constitute espionage or treason 
during his trial vanunu testified he made his revelations to 
the newspaper to alert the middle east and the world to the dangers 
of nuclear weapons not for personal gain or out of a desire to 
harm his country 
the maximum punishment for the treason and espionage charges is 
life but the judges took into account vanunus indications that he 
regretted his actions 
vanunu was brought to the supreme court sunday in a white van 
with the windows covered so he could not be seen by photographers 
or reporters 
the supreme court said it would hear arguments within 30 days on 
whether to make public its full decision on vanunus appeal 
vanunu also has 30 days to appeal the decision to a larger 
supreme court panel or ask for a reduction in his sentence 
he has 14 years left to serve since his time in jail before his 
conviction was counted as time served he is jailed in the ashkelon 
prison in a private cell 
the three judges who rejected the appeal were meir shamgar dov 
levin and eliezer goldberg

gunmen opened fire on a soviet military patrol at 
yerevans main train station early sunday and the soldiers 
returned fire killing six of the attackers the official tass news 
agency said 
ten soldiers and a bystander were wounded in the exchange of 
fire in the capital of the caucasus republic armenia tass said 
no one claimed responsibility for the attack but it was 
probably carried out by militants involved in the bitter struggle 
between armenia and neighboring azerbaijan for control of the 
nagornokarabakh region 
in more than two years several hundred people have been killed 
in the violence and hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee 
their homes 
soviet soldiers have been sent into both of the republics in an 
effort to quell the violence 
satenik haramazyan a spokeswoman for the armenian national 
movement political organization confirmed in a telephone interview 
from yerevan that the shootout had taken place but she said no 
details were available she said the movement did not know who 
attacked the soldiers 
the movement held a rally on opera square in downtown yerevan on 
sunday afternoon to tell citizens what it knew about the attack 
she said 
the soldiers were returning early sunday morning from escorting 
a train to kafan a city 120 miles southeast of yerevan in the 
corner of the caucasus republic when the shooting broke out tass 
said 
the soldiers were attacked by a group of up to 15 armed men it 
said 
soldiers using their right to use weapons to rebuff an 
attack returned fire as a result of the exchange of fire five of 
the attackers were killed and two were wounded the news report 
said one of the wounded died soon 
tass said three of the 10 soldiers were seriously injured one 
bystander who received bullet wounds in the shootout also was taken 
to the hospital it said but the report did not say how seriously 
he was wounded 
it also did not say where in the train station the shooting 
occurred and officials at the station could not immediately be 
reached for more details 
the shootout came three days after militants fired on soldiers 
at military checkpoints and on patrol in nagornokarabakh killing 
one soldier and wounding four tass said one attacker was killed 
and six were wounded by soldiers 
both armenian and azerbaijani militants obtained large supplies 
of weapons during fighting between the two sides that occurred in 
early january and have rebuffed efforts by officials to take back 
many of the guns 
the dispute between the neighboring republics is over 
nagornokarabkh an enclave located in azerbaijan but that is 
mostly armenian in an effort to stop the violence moscow took 
over administrative control of nagornokarabakh in january 1989 
and armenians now demand moscows relinquish control 
armenia is predominantly christian while azerbaijan is mostly 
moslem

may has been a month of horror for europes jews 
but also a month of hope and healing 
a wave of antisemitic threats desecrations and vandalism 
across the continent including the gruesome mutilation of a corpse 
at a jewish cemetery in france provoked revulsion and reawakened 
old fears 
yet the same incidents inspired unprecedented displays of 
solidarity and reconciliation suggesting to some jews that much of 
europe had learned the lessons of the holocaust 
francois mitterrand marching with a throng of parisians 
protesting the desecration at carpentras became the first 
president of postwar france to join a public demonstration 
king baudouin became the first belgian monarch to invite rabbis 
to the royal palace where they heard his words of sympathy and 
concern 
prime minister lothar de maiziere of east germany broke with the 
ousted communists who had denied any role in the nazi 
extermination of 6 million jews and pledged to seek reconciliation 
with the international jewish community 
in oberammergau west germany the centuriesold passion play 
about the suffering of jesus was performed in a rewritten version 
shorn of antisemitic passages 
for some jews such gestures were not enough the american 
jewish congress took a fullpage advertisement tuesday in the 
international herald tribune asking europes political and 
religious leaders to speak out clearly and forthrightly 
against the ugly cadences of antisemitic slogans and threats 
much of europe has been plagued with relatively minor 
antisemitic incidents notably nazioriented graffiti but jews 
had not anticipated the shock of carpentras home of frances 
oldest synagogue 
relatives arriving at the cemetery may 10 found 34 tombs 
vandalized and the recently buried body of felix germon 81 dug up 
and impaled on an umbrella handle 
since then jewish cemeteries and synagogues have been 
desecrated in several other towns in france and in hungary east 
berlin london and naples italy 
in romania over the past two weeks vandals desecrated about 70 
graves in three cities and nearly half belonged to jews in the 
transylvanian town of tirgu mures 28 jewish graves were vandalized 
the carpentras case has not been solved despite the efforts of 
more than 60 police investigators most of those arrested in 
connection with other recent desecrations in france have been 
skinheads youths with closecropped hair and vaguely fascist 
ideologies 
there has been no proof of involvement by frances extremeright 
national front whose brash leader jeanmarie le pen has been 
accused of inciting racist and antisemitic feelings 
analysts in several european countries suggest the outbreak of 
antisemitic activity is tied to a broader resentment of immigrants 
and fear of economic turmoil 
historically western europe was a white continent said 
tullia zevi a jewish leader in italy now it is becoming 
multiethnic like the united states 
this is creating feelings of great insecurity and uneasiness 
there is a resumption of ancient prejudices against jews combined 
with a new form of racism projected against the new immigrant 
minority 
even though most jewish families in france go back generations 
they suffer their compatriots worries said bob goldman european 
director for the usbased antidefamation league 
the handiest target are the jews goldman said in a 
telephone interview a lot of people traditionally see them as 
foreign and different 
in parts of eastern europe growing nationalism has stirred 
fears of resurgent antisemitism 
soccer fans in the soviet republic of uzbekistan were said to 
have targeted jewish homes during a rampage may 2 an extreme 
nationalist russian group called pamyat or memory has spread 
propaganda blaming jews for social ills and urging a new final 
solution 
the russian people is not really more antisemitic than any 
other but with the constant irritation of shortages and life 
getting worse its becoming meaner and more irritable said 
jewish activist natasha stonov everything is covered with 
gasoline and all it takes is a match 
about 15 million jews live in the soviet union and the number 
is dropping steadily because of emigration the rest of europe has 
only that many in all a fraction of the total before world war ii 
a survey by the foundation for combating antisemitism of 
rotterdam published this week indicated surprisingly little 
evidence of antisemitism in hungary romania and even in poland 
despite the controversy about a roman catholic convent at the site 
of the auschwitz death camp 
richard stein foundation chairman said the conditions were 
worst in france and italy where there is extensive antisemitism 
beneath the surface 
after carpentras many french people invoked images of nazisms 
rise before world war ii but prominent sociologist pierreandre 
taguieff said comparisons with the 1930s are catastrophic and 
wrong 
today antisemites are marginal he wrote in an essay 
they feel persecuted they refuse to admit what they are 
the mass march by mitterrand and up to 200000 compatriots many 
of them nonjews wearing yellow stars of david would be 
unthinkable in the 1930s he said 
frances chief rabbi joseph sitruk sounded a similar note at 
carpentras when he led more than 10000 people of all faiths in a 
service at the cemetery the weekend after the desecration 
france is not antisemitic the rabbi preached what a 
beautiful lesson is given here this morning i dare to say it 
what happiness what happiness to see france identifying with our 
suffering

jeanmarie le pen has been accused of 
antisemitism and xenophobia in his crusade to keep france french 
the press calls him a devil but le pen doesnt care 
if i told you it gives me pleasure would you be surprised 
he says with a grin 
after 30 years of battle in the public arena le pen refuses to 
yield now 
im a man with a mission he said alluding to death 
threats he added if i fall i will have accomplished it 
le pen and his national front fear colonization by 
foreigners they want to expel immigrants and enact new 
antiimmigration laws 
to the accusations of racism antisemitism and xenophobia le 
pen replies that he is simply a patriot who says in public what 
other people think in private 
after the discovery may 10 of the desecration of the jewish 
cemetery in carpentras and mutilation of a corpse interior 
minister pierre joxe accused le pen of fostering hate le pen was 
present only in effigy at a huge protest march in paris that 
attracted all the main political parties 
i am carpentras read a sign on the effigy 
it leaves me rather cold le pen said settling into a chair 
in the study of his home in st cloud a suburb of paris 
i have the calm of an old soldier ive often seen the whites 
of the enemys eyes 
for him the enemy is the political establishment supported by 
the media which he claims echo its lies he says the desecration 
at carpentras was a plot carried out by professionals to discredit 
him 
there is one thing im sure of it is that im not guilty and 
the national front is not guilty le pen said i dont know who 
did it but i know who didnt do it 
like a television preacher le pen knows how to pump a crowd he 
struts cajoles and rages tempering his streetsmart edge with 
quotes from pascal or latin citations he is silverhaired 
physically imposing and even detractors acknowledge he has 
charisma 
the 61yearold breton whom the french press calls the 
beast or the devil thrives on controversy 
democracy is a debate a combat of ideas he said recently 
its not a parade of armchair philosophers with good 
intentions 
on a bookshelf sits a portrait of le pen wearing the black 
bandanna he once affected to cover the eye he lost in a street 
fight defending a parliamentary deputy 
a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who fought in 
indochina and algeria he now fights many of his battles in court 
le pen a deputy in the european parliament has been convicted 
three times and fined for making remarks about jews or the 
holocaust but he denies being racist or antisemitic he says he 
has won 30 slander suits against the press 
me racist its a gag a gag he boomed but im not for 
the melting pot im for the defense of ones culture id despair 
if i found the culture of brooklyn in france 
of jews he said if they are french theres no problem im 
not antisemitic 
on wednesday a court fined le pen for saying in 1987 that the 
nazi gas chambers were a detail of world war ii history 
the justice ministry has succeeded in getting le pens 
parliamentary immunity lifted to prosecute him for two other 
remarks a play on words in 1988 linking the name of a cabinet 
minister to nazi crematory ovens and his assertion last year that 
the jewish international was partly responsible for the 
antinational spirit 
who is charged to say what one can and cannot say in a free 
country he said 
le pen founded the national front in 1972 and remained obscure 
until the party broke through in 1984 getting 11 percent of the 
vote in european parliament elections he startled france in 1988 
by winning 14 percent in the first round of presidential voting 
politicians of all sorts have scrambled to either outmaneuver or 
accommodate him or to woo his followers with tough talk on 
immigration 
by getting the law on voter representation changed the 
government of former premier jacques chirac managed to reduce the 
national fronts parliamentary seats from 33 to one 
since carpentras which set off a wave of antisemitic acts le 
pen is being denounced with greater vigor than ever 
he is a man dangerous for national unity for civil peace 
declared chirac now a conservative leader 
he boos the name of gen de gaulle and applauds that of the 
nazi schoenhuber chirac said franz schoenhuber a former member 
of the waffen ss is a farright colleague of le pen in the 
european parliament 
at least six cities including la trinitesurmer his hometown 
in brittany recently denied le pen and his followers meeting space 
le pen compares himself to a fire chief racing across town 
sirens blaring in time to contain the blaze 
everybody says see that racist fire its fire chief le pen 
who is guilty you can even see all the noise he makes with his big 
horn he said racism is not increasing in france le pen said 
but there is increasing fear tied to insecurity toward foreigners 
and nobody dares say so everyone is afraid to be called a racist 
he read from newspaper clippings of attacks on french citizens 
by people with arab names 
of course im afraid he said if europe is europe its 
because it has resisted conquest by outsiders 
le pen plans to run for president again in 1995 
citing audience ratings after his recent appearance on a 
political talk show he said i had 13 percent and brigitte 
bardot had just 54 percent on a competing channel

the jones family is back together but it 
took three decades of searching and hoping 
its all so fresh and today is the day jim ahlers who was 
born james thomas jones said saturday at the family reunion in 
callaway park we made it 
in 1960 his mother was arrested for child neglect and he and 
his 10 brothers and sisters were taken to a childrens home in 
hamilton ohio there they were separated according to age and sex 
and later they were adopted 
ralph jones began his search when he left the orphanage in 1961 
now theyre all grown up he said i never thought id see 
the day 
most of the siblings their mother has died had already been 
reunited before saturdays reunion but two of the boys remained 
unfound 
i remember all of them said lavern lang the oldest of the 
siblings up until jimmy found us this year we thought that would 
be it we thought we would never find dennis or jimmy 
but jimmy ahlers 34 found his family this month and one week 
later the family found the youngest sibling dennis brown who was 
an infant at the time of the separation 
i dont have words for it my feelings are running wild its 
starting to sink in a little bit brown said

them had of their earlier lives 
ahlers said the search isnt over my grandmother is alive and 
holding me in the original photo i want to meet her he said

the people who believe animals should be 
treated more humanely are about to stage their first national 
event a march for the animals intended to demonstrate that 
their movement is becoming a mainstream cause 
we will march peacefully and nonviolently to show america 
that we are reasonable and rational people and not a bunch of 
lunatics says one of the organizers peter linck executive 
director of the national alliance for animal legislation 
our purpose is to unify ourselves and educate the country and 
raise the nations consciousness he said 
the march from the ellipse behind the white house to the 
capitol is scheduled to take place june 10 
linck said the animal protection movement is the countrys 
fastestgrowing cause the humane society of the united states an 
oldline group which describes itself as moderate has seen its 
membership increase fourfold from 325000 in 1985 to 12 million 
today 
another group friends of animals has grown quickly too from 
60000 members three years ago to double that number but 
president priscilla feral said more significant is the way the 
concerns of animal lovers are being shared by people not involved 
in the movement 
it is absolutely normal now to hear people talking about 
whether to buy a fur coat or take the kids to the circus or about 
the campaign to save the dolphins ms feral said in an interview 
recently 
she said the growth of the 1975 friends of the animals tuna 
boycott was a factor in the decision in april by the makers of 
starkist bumble bee and chicken of the sea brands to stop buying 
tuna captured with fishing nets that also trap and kill dolphins 
linck said thousands of participants from all 50 states and at 
least half a dozen foreign countries are expected at the march at 
30 linck is a veteran of the animal protection movement in 
college he switched from a preveterinarian course of study to law 
so he could lobby for animal welfare issues 
he is cochairman of the demonstration with tom regan author of 
the case for animal rights the march is sponsored by hundreds 
of local and national groups 
the animal protection movement represents divergent views some 
activists are meateaters and some like linck decline even to 
wear shoes made of leather some believe the use of animals in 
biomedical research is acceptable and some do not 
but a reverence for life would be their common concern said 
linck 
he said some in the movement believe that all creatures even 
insects have an inherent right to live and should be respected 
to the highest degree possible while others would draw the line at 
mammals 
the organizers have lined up a number of proanimal celebrities 
to address the crowd ranging from cartoonist berke breathed to 
professional basketball player james donaldson and anticipate 
hearing from a number of sympathetic politicians too the political 
speakers have not been announced because they are still being 
recruited 
one prominent speaker will be australian philosopher peter 
singer author of animal liberation who is considered the 
father of the modern animal rights movement 
another speaker will be mayor bill stirling of aspen colo 
backer of a proposal to ban the sale of fur in aspen voters 
rejected the ban by a 21 margin in february but supporters 
claimed a victory by bringing national attention to the issue 
the marchs sponsoring organizations have a variety of goals 
more humane farm practices abolishing hunting as a sport limiting 
the use of animals for testing medications cosmetics and other 
products halting fur sales banning the use of the steel leg hold 
trap described as a cruel way to catch wild animals for their 
furs and having pets spayed and neutered to prevent overpopulation 
on the day following their demonstration the marchers plan to 
lobby congress in support of 60 animal protection bills that have 
been introduced but will concentrate on three proposed measures 
one would prohibit the use of an animal test that measures 
pesticides cosmetics drugs weedkillers and household products 
for toxicity opponents say the test is unnecessary and causes 
suffering or death for up to 5 million animals a year 
another would prohibit the practice of confining veal calves in 
small crates and the practice of feeding them a diet deficient in 
solid food and iron to produce white meat 
a third would prohibit hunting and trapping of wildlife for 
sport or commercial purposes on national wildlife refuges

the remains of five american soldieres 
killed more than 35 years ago in the korean war and held since then 
by north korea will begin their final journey home on memorial day 
a us congressional delegation arrived in seoul sunday to 
arrange for the first return of us korean war dead from communist 
north korea since 1954 
the return of the remains is widely seen as a gesture by north 
korea to improve relations with the united states the two 
countries do not have diplomatic relations 
the eightman us delegation led by rep gv sonny 
montgomery dmiss chairman of the house veterans affairs 
committee will travel monday to the truce village of panmunjom to 
receive the remains panmunjom is in the demilitarized zone 
separating south korea and north korea 
the congressmen arrived on a special flight that landed at an 
airport outside seoul reporters were not allowed to cover their 
arrival 
us military officials in seoul said montgomery would receive 
the remains after signing a document with a north korean lawmaker 
the delegation will then turn the remains over to the us 
military which plans to send them to a forensic laboratory in 
honolulu for identification 
the us defense department said the north koreans identified 
two of the dead as army 1st lt jack j saunders 27 of ogden 
utah and army cpl arthur leo seaton 20 whose family lived in 
chester pa 
both soldiers were listed as missing in action in february 1951 
the pentagon said 
north korean diplomats assigned to the united nations told the 
associated press saturday that a pilot also was believed to be 
among the dead 
there were largescale returns of remains in 1953 and 1954 
then after years of no returns the north koreans announced may 14 
that they would turn over the remains of five americans on memorial 
day 
ho jong north koreas deputy permanent representative at its 
un mission said the communist government in pyongyang was 
prepared to discuss returning more 
he said the move was an eloquent illustration of north 
koreas willingness to settle pending issues with the us 
government in a good way 
the americanled united nations command in seoul said more than 
9000 un command military personnel were unaccounted for after 
the war ended including 8177 americans and soldiers from canada 
australia and england 
official figures show that 33629 us soldiers were killed and 
103284 wounded in the war 
the un command includes the united states and 15 other nations 
that fought on south koreas side after north korean forces invaded 
across the 38th parallel dividing the korean peninsula on june 25 
1950 
the threeyear conflict left more than 1 million people dead and 
another 1 million wounded 
north korea acknowledged for the first time in january 1988 that 
it was still holding the remains of un command war dead 
the north koreans agreed to begin negotiations on returning the 
remains a few weeks later but then canceled the talks after the 
united states accused north korea of sponsoring terrorism in 
connection with the bombing of a south korean civilian airliner 
the korean air jet disappeared off the coast of burma in 
november 1987 and all 115 people aboard the plane died 
a woman who was among the passengers on an early leg of the 
flight was arrested later and testified that she had planted a time 
bomb on the plane on orders from north korean leaders who wanted to 
scare people away from the 1988 summer olympics in seoul north 
korea denied the allegations 
other members of the congressional delegation are democrats 
frank mccloskey of indiana james bilbray of nevada bob traxler of 
michigan and ben campbell of colorado and republicans bob stump of 
arizona curt weldon of pennsylvania and gerald solomon of new york

the faster new drugs are rushed to market the 
more likely they will produce severe unanticipated side effects 
congressional auditors conclude in a report saying half the new 
products introduced over a decade had to be relabeled with new 
warnings 
certain classes of drugs heart antiinflammatory 
psychopharmacologic dermatologic and antibiotic were most likely 
to have serious postapproval reactions the general accounting 
office said in a report prepared for release sunday 
especially troubling said the gao was that drugs for use 
by children were twice as likely to have reports of serious 
unanticipated reactions after their approval by the food and drug 
administration 
the gao reviewed label changes for the 209 new drugs that were 
approved from 1976 to 1985 to determine the seriousness of 
additional risks identified after the drugs were approved 
the study found that of the 198 drugs for which data could be 
found 102 or 515 percent had reports of serious adverse 
reactions those reactions were defined as leading to 
hospitalization or increased length of hospitalization or 
resulting in severe or permanent disability or death 
six of the drugs were withdrawn from the market and labels on 
the rest were changed to add major warnings or precautions for 
their use or to restrict for whom the drug should be prescribed 
the report said 
rep ted weiss dny who requested the report said 
shortcomings in the fdas drug approval process may be responsible 
for serious adverse reactions 
serious and unanticipated adverse reactions are certainly a 
risk we must accept when fda shortens the review time for 
experimental drugs to treat immediately lifethreatening illnesses 
such as aids and cancer weiss said 
but for less serious diseases this may be too high a price to 
pay for shorter approval times he said 
by failing to systematically use evidence of postapproval 
risks linked to drugs already on the market fda may be overlooking 
problems with similar drugs under review at the agency but not yet 
approved weiss said 
the fda in comments included in the report said the gaos 
review was not methodologically sound and would unnecessarily 
alarm consumers 
even the most extensive premarket testing cannot cover all 
possible circumstances said fda spokesman jeff nesbit testing 
perhaps 3000 people over months or years wont always identify a 
rare reaction unfolding over a long time or affecting perhaps just 
one person in 10000 
he said that is why fda monitors reports of adverse drug 
reactions after a product is marketed 
it can take as long as eight to 10 years for a drug to move 
through the fda approval process beginning when a company applies 
for permission to test a new product in humans 
the first studies test the drugs safety in a small number of 
people later the drug is tested for effectiveness if after the 
fda reviews all the data which on average takes 29 months 
according to gao the drug may be approved for marketing 
because the preapproval testing involves small numbers of 
patients more information about the drug usually surfaces after 
the drug is approved and distributed widely the fda monitors 
reports of adverse reactions and sometimes requires postapproval 
research as a condition of approval 
the time between a drugs approval and a postmarketing label 
change is five years or more the gao report said 
the congressional auditors recommended that fda establish a 
systematic procedure to assure that serious reactions discovered 
after a drugs approval are evaluated to identify possible risks 
with similar drugs not yet on the market

three members of the house armed services 
committee want the bush administration to finance the mexican 
governments mobile strike forces that sweep in on drug traffickers 
at landing strips 
after inspecting drug war command centers the lawmakers said in 
a report released sunday that officials have largely succeeded in 
combatting the flow of drugs across the mexican border via aircraft 
we have forced the drug industry to look for new routes and 
new methods the lawmakers said 
radar is capable of tracking aircraft carrying drugs to landing 
sites in northern mexico but enforcement officials are unable to 
get there before the drugs are dispersed 
mexico now has a handful of mobile strike forces located in 
northern mexico designed expressly to do what we are suggesting 
move in swiftly for the kill at the landing sites the lawmakers 
said 
they suggested that the united states provide the funds for the 
mexican strike teams no specific totals were provided 
the report in the form of a may 23 letter to house armed 
services chairman les aspin dwis was written by reps nicholas 
mavroules dmass who chairs the panels investigations 
subcommittee lane evans dill and jim mccrery rla 
the lawmakers said an alternative to us financing of mexican 
strike teams would be increasing the us border patrol which now 
has 3900 officers 
however even a doubling or tripling of the manpower along the 
border would be unlikely to make a huge dent in the volume of drugs 
crossing the border they said

the soviet unions popularity has soared in the 
united states since the last superpower summit and americans 
increasingly support us military cuts to reflect the lessened 
tensions a survey found 
as president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev prepare 
to meet in washington this week the national media 
generalassociated press poll found both leaders continuing to 
command great popularity among americans 
gorbachev slipped only slightly from his overall rating in a 
similar poll before the last summit in december even though a 
third of the respondents now think less highly of him because of 
his crackdown on lithuania 
most striking in the new survey were growing expressions of good 
will toward americas old cold war foe fortyone percent of the 
respondents said they held favorable views of the soviet union 
well up from 24 percent last november and 15 percent in a 1987 
survey 
fourteen percent of the respondents in the new poll had 
unfavorable opinions of the soviet union and 41 percent had a 
neutral view 
in another measure of growing trust a relatively low 29 percent 
believed the soviets seek to dominate the world that fear factor 
stood at 35 percent last november and 50 percent in a cbs newsnew 
york times poll a year ago 
the new media generalap survey was conducted by telephone may 
1120 among a random sample of 1143 adults across the country it 
had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points 
the summit starts wednesday amid continuing upheaval in the 
communist world gorbachev is pushing reforms of the soviet system 
while struggling to contain independence movements in some of the 
soviet republics his eastern european allies once viewed as 
puppets largely have abandoned communism 
possibly because of gorbachevs difficulties the survey found 
some sense that the initiative in superpower relations has shifted 
to bush in november 41 percent said gorbachev was doing more than 
bush to reduce tensions but in the new survey that fell to 33 
percent 
at the same time those saying bush was doing more to ease 
tensions rose from 29 percent in november to 38 percent now the 
rest were unsure 
similarly 54 percent said bush was doing enough to encourage 
soviet reforms up from 46 percent in november and 33 percent 
said he was being too cautious down from 40 percent in november 
again the rest were unsure 
in view of the lessened tensions 50 percent in the new survey 
said the united states should reduce its military spending 
significantly up from 41 percent who favored such cuts last 
november 
additionally nearly four in 10 said the united states should 
immediately begin reducing its forces in western europe while 
still a minority that was up from 25 percent in november 
the poll found some lingering suspicion of the soviets half 
said the soviet union cannot be trusted to live up to arms control 
agreements about the same as in november but down from 61 
percent a year ago 
on lithuania 46 percent said the breakaway baltic republic 
should back off from its claim of independence from the soviet 
union and hold negotiations while 31 percent said it should push 
its claim the rest had no opinion 
but there was support for gradual independence for the baltic 
states fiftyseven percent favored the actions of lithuania and 
latvia which have claimed independence while just 8 percent 
favored the actions of estonia which wants independence but has 
not formally claimed it 
gorbachev has responded to lithuanias claim by denying it 
shipments of oil and other supplies while 34 percent said the

a stunt plane crashed in flames while 
trying a rollover maneuver during an air show killing the pilot 
as 1000 stunned spectators watched authorities said 
macon county coroner hal bentley said albert butler 28 of 
houston was killed in the crash saturday evening at the annual 
memorial day air show there were no other injuries 
it shocked the crowd pretty good especially when the fire 
covered that big area bentley said spectators were about 300 
yards from the crash site 
butler a member of negro airmen international was trying to 
attempt a rollover a trick maneuver bentley said he was kind 
of low and it just went down 
federal aviation administration investigators were at the scene 
sunday he said 
witnesses said two planes were in the air when one came in low 
over the airfield did a roll and dropped the pilot of the second 
plane was not even aware the other one had crashed until after he 
landed bentley said 
the annual air show is held as a tribute to black pilots who 
were trained at tuskegee during world war ii when the air force 
was segregated pilots from different chapters of the negro airmen 
international take part in the show each year said assistant 
police chief john meadows

the economy is in shambles republics erupt in 
explosive ethnic quarrels others try to secede comrades squabble 
over what is to be done and do nothing 
yet mikhail s gorbachev not only survives but is championed 
around the world as a hero of epic proportion 
in the five years of his reign he has ended the cold war taken 
the first steps toward nuclear disarmament pulled his army out of 
afghanistan and begun the withdrawal of soviet troops from foreign 
soil tens of millions of his countrymen and millions more in the 
former soviet satellite states of eastern europe have been freed 
from totalitarian rule 
i think observed a soviet teacher who recently returned 
from her first trip to the west he is more popular abroad than 
he is at home 
two polls released sunday lent support to that assertion a 
washington postabc news poll said 73 percent of 1526 american 
adults surveyed last week said they had a favorable impression 
of gorbachev with 25 percent responding unfavorable a media 
generalassociated press survey taken may 1120 among 1143 adults 
nationwide found that 63 percent had a favorable impression of the 
soviet leader both polls had a margin of error of plus or minus 
three percentage points 
at home however gorbachev is no hero to many soviets 
understandably preoccupied with the issues of everyday life the 
food and ordinary goods they cant buy the critical housing 
shortage that denies them simple comfort and privacy the rising 
crime rate and ethnic strife that make them fearful for their 
families and meager possessions 
he has pleaded futilely with lithuanian officials not to declare 
their independence and has been jeered to his face by 
protestors comparing him to nicolae ceausescu the stalinist 
dictator of romania executed in december in the midst of a popular 
uprising 
but perhaps most frightening in a society so wrenched by this 
centurys calamitous events is the uncertainty of what is to come 
that fear of change is at once his toughest obstacle and his best 
protection 
perestroika depends on public opinion and thats 
conservative the president told reporters this month in a frank 
acknowledgement that hes been unable so far to initiate a 
longawaited transition to a stateregulated market economy 
the associated press learned that gorbachevs key advisers were 
actively working on a plan to institute a polishstyle shock 
therapy announcement of a virtual overnight conversion of the 
economic system by freeing most prices and currency controls and 
letting market forces revamp the economy it is said that poland 
shortened the painful transition period of high unemployment and 
runaway inflation by moving swiftly after the fall of the communist 
government there 
but the soviet plan to try something similar leaked to the 
press touching off an outcry from a fearful public gorbachev and 
other top officials later denied they would attempt such a radical 
move 
last week gorbachevs advisers approved a milder reform plan 
which envisions a doubling of food prices an 82 percent rise in 
energy costs and an average 43 percent rise in retail prices but 
only if the public supports it in a national referendum 
the announcement of the food price hikes set off a wave of panic 
buying prompting moscow officials to announce plans to restrict 
sales of many food and consumer products to cut down on hoarding 
absent public support first deputy premier yuri maslyukov told 
a news conference perhaps we will have to resort to roundtable 
discussions to devise a plan that would be supported 
he said the government was not proposing shocktherapy 
changes because such reforms could throw 40 million people out of 
work and would lead the country to the edge of an economic 
crash 
some soviet citizens reacted with apathy to the announcement 
others with emotion a 65yearold woman said i have been 
suffering all my life another woman said the reforms would make 
food so expensive that ill have to put my teeth away on a 
shelf 
gorbachev is in a tough position as head of the communist 
party said vyacheslav shostakovsky rector of the higher party 
school in moscow in the party everyone from the right wing 
from the left wing is criticizing him 
but shostakovsky a leading member of the democratic platform 
group that is pushing within the party for faster reform added 
that as president gorbachev retains the support of a broad 
centrist element in the country despite the sharp criticism of him 
from the more radical wings of his own party 
a peasant by birth and a product of the communist system 
gorbachev has demonstrated repeatedly he is quite capable of taking 
one position based on traditional ideology then abandoning it in 
the face of popular discontent he did that in being converted to 
legalization of private ownership of factories the means of 
production classical marxists insisted were tools of exploitation 
unless held by the state 
it sometimes even appears he has helped fuel the publics demand 
for change after stubbornly resisting calls for a multiparty 
system he accepted the idea then gave at least tacit support to a 
huge demonstration through downtown moscow to increase pressure on 
the party leadership to go along 
while calling constantly for perestroika or economic 
restructuring gorbachev often defines the debate with radicals on 
both sides opposed to him he thus makes adoption of his reform 
proposal appear to be the centrist position 
through adroit political maneuver gorbachev now sits 
comfortably atop both the party and the government his adversaries 
on the right led by yegor k ligachev a spokesman for doctrinaire 
communism no longer hold positions of power his most vocal critic 
on the left communist maverick boris n yeltsin is waging a 
campaign for the presidency of the russian republic which would 
give him a new soapbox but little administrative authority over the 
vast territory that forms the largest of the unions 15 constituent 
republics 
after giving in to popular demands that the communist party 
surrender its monopoly gorbachev led a drive this spring to 
legalize competing parties and simultaneously establish a strong 
presidency a post he then handily won for himself in a clear 
demonstration of political clout 
as the party inevitably loses its command over daily life 
gorbachev can continue to rule from his new power base at the top 
of the government 
the president and his supporters are fond of saying there is no 
alternative to perestroika for now at least the same might be 
said of perestroikas champion 
the country cant do without gorbachev now said lidya 
sharlai who raises pigs on a collective farm outside moscow in 
a few years perhaps but right now there is no one else

president bush joined in the singing 
of let there be peace on earth at a memorial day service after 
church sunday and voiced hope that this weeks summit will bring 
that goal closer 
bush and his wife barbara worshipped with 150 others at the 
first congregational church and afterwards joined parishioners in 
praying for peace at an outdoor monument to a local son terry 
drown killed in vietnam in 1969 
bush was relaxing this weekend at his oceanfront home here as he 
prepares to welcome soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to the 
white house on thursday 
asked if he had a message to the nation on this weekend when 
americas war dead are remembered the president said simply 
respect for those that gave their lives and recognition that 
the worlds getting smaller 
i think everybody regardless of their faith and background 
aspires to see a world of peace thats what this little 
service is about and certainly thats what this summit coming up 
with gorbachev is about he said 
inside the spare but striking white clapboard church the rev 
patricia adams spoke of the changes bush alluded to 
our world is getting smaller every year said the minister 
we have begun to learn that we can live together despite our 
differences we dont have to be clones different ideologies 
different ideas different dreams can coexist quite happily 
the bushes who are episcopalians have attended the 
congregational church before usually during visits here in the 
spring winter or fall the episcopal church st anns has not 
yet opened for the summer 
every pew was packed on a brilliant sunny morning and two fans 
on the 18foothigh ceiling did little to keep the room from 
becoming warm after weeks of rain the coastal area has basked in 
three bright days since bush arrived friday 
the minister called it the first official weekend of summer 
and offered a word of welcome to the washington branch of our 
family 
bush stood to introduce transportation secretary samuel skinner 
and a few others in his party 
when the minister solicited prayers for the sick bushs son 
marvin mentioned lee atwater the ailing republican party chairman 
a massive mahogany organ with pipes painted gold stretched 
almost to the ceiling at the front of the church the sixmember 
choir sang hymns and patriotic airs 
the entire congregation marched outside to the strains of o 
beautiful for spacious skies to the monument across the street 
marshall bush 3 sat at her grandparents feet beside the 
granite marker dangling her foot skyward for mrs bush to tie a 
shoe during the singing of let there be peace on earth 
then bush shook hands all around and headed for his limousine 
telling the minister i think well push on and clear the 
roadway

two years and another administration ago the 
pentagon promised to study the records of black soldiers to 
determine why none of them received the medal of honor for valor 
during world wars i and ii 
since then george bush was elected president and the two 
congressmen who were birddogging the pentagon on the subject are 
gone rep mickey leland dtexas died in a plane crash and joseph 
dioguardi rny was defeated for reelection 
but the probe has not been scuttled a pentagon spokesman said 
last week 
neither has it been finished 
the study is still going on and the reason its taking so long 
is most of these black soldiers were with french units maj doug 
hart a defense department spokesman said in an interview 
the french records of one world war i unit became available only 
in february hart said military researchers are also looking at 
world war ii records of three black navy seamen who received the 
distinguished service cross he said 
hart said the investigations will probably be completed later 
this summer 
that pleases leroy ramsey an albany ny historian who six 
years ago began a lonely quest to correct what he feels is a great 
injustice 
im kind of perturbed that its taken so long but i am pleased 
that the pentagon agreed to give it a full review ramsey said in 
an interview last week 
a black world war ii veteran himself ramsey was stunned to 
discover while researching a book that not one of the 15 million 
black americans who served in the world wars received the nations 
highest military decoration for bravery 
blacks were excluded from us combat units in both world wars 
but more than a few were cited for bravery ramsey learned upon 
examining the records of servicemen awarded the distinguished 
service cross and the french croix de guerre 
ramsey then read the nations more than 1200 medal of honor 
citations and concluded that at least one black world war i soldier 
and one black world war ii seaman had records strong enough to 
warrant the highest honor 
i didnt want this to be token because these guys were 
black ramsey stressed 
the two he selected were army sgt henry johnson of albany 
ny and seaman dorrie miller of waco texas both are dead 
by 1987 ramsey had succeeded in interesting dioguardi and 
leland in his cause the two sponsored legislation to award 
posthumous medals of honor to johnson and miller but the pentagon 
opposed the bill because it singled out two individuals 
in october 1988 then defensesecretary frank carlucci announced 
the army would review the records of black world war i heroes and 
said he would ask the navy about the feasibility of doing the same 
with blacks in world war ii 
hart said the pentagon is now looking at the records of johnson 
and all the men in his unit millers record also is under review 
along with those of seamen william cook pinckney and leonard roy 
harmon hart said 
johnson who fought with the french army in world war i killed 
four german soldiers rescued a wounded comrade and captured a 
stockpile of weapons all despite severe wounds he was awarded the 
croix de guerre frances highest military honor but was never 
cited by the united states he died in 1930 
miller was a mess steward on the uss west virginia when it was 
attacked at pearl harbor while the battleship was being shelled 
he helped moved its wounded captain from the ships bridge then 
returned to man a machine gun miller received a distinguished 
service cross and a warship was named for him in 1971 he was 
killed in a torpedo attack in 1943 
harmon of texas was a mess attendant aboard the uss san 
francisco during a battle with the japanese near the solomon 
islands in 1942 he deliberately exposed himself to hostile gunfire 
in order to protect a wounded shipmate and was killed according to 
his citation 
pinckney of south carolina was a cook on the uss enterprise in 
a battle with the japanese near the santa cruz islands in 1942 
during heavy bombing pinckney carried a comrade to safety before 
pushing his way out of a burning compartment

those chemicals that damage the ozone layer 
high in the sky may prove useful to scientists studying the deep 
oceans 
chlorofluorocarbons known as cfcs are humanmade chemicals 
used as refrigerants and in industrial and cosmetic uses 
they have caused concern in recent years because they can damage 
the ozone layer a region of the stratosphere that protects earth 
from damaging solar radiation 
but some cfcs also are absorbed into the water at the surface of 
the oceans and scientists at the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration are tracking those chemicals to learn more about 
ocean circulation and seaair interaction 
the release of cfcs into the environment during the past 40 
years has inadvertently provided oceanographers with a tool to 
study the rates by which compounds can be transferred from surface 
water into the deep ocean reports john bullister of noaas 
pacific marine environmental laboratory in seattle 
these studies can help scientists learn more about the ability 
of the ocean to absorb other pollutants and problem gases such as 
the increasing carbon dioxide that many consider a threat that 
could lead to global warming 
the ability of the oceans which cover the majority of the 
planet to absorb such gases has not been well understood by 
scientists 
since cfcs have no natural sources and have come into common 
use only in the last 40 years scientists can track their presence 
in various ocean layers they use the concentration of cfcs to help 
determine rates of mixing in the water deep sea currents and 
various deep temperature layers 
the fact that cfcs do not break down readily a characteristic 
that makes them a threat in the atmosphere increases their 
usefulness as tracers in the ocean 
that longevity allows cfcs in the air to rise high into the 
stratosphere where they interact with sunlight and damage the 
protective layer of ozone ozone screens out ultraviolet light and 
if it is reduced the result could be more cases of skin cancer and 
other skin and eye damage as well as threats to crops and livestock 
cfcs are no longer used as aerosol propellants in the united 
states and international efforts are under way to reduce their uses 
worldwide

hikers have discovered the body of a man 
who went for a walk in subfreezing temperatures in 1983 and left 
his wife a note saying he intended to walk until he died 
the remains of cloyd ferrall howard were found in a remote 
jefferson county area thursday by two hikers exploring for mountain 
caverns in the lost creek wilderness area 
howard was 33 when he left the note for his wife on jan 29 
1983 searches failed to turn up any sign of the missing man until 
last week 
howards skeleton was still partially clad in jeans and hiking 
boots he was identified saturday through dental charts 
the skeleton still had on heavyduty hiking boots jeans a 
jacket and a digital watch he had 80 cents in his jeans pocket 
we had a good idea it was howard because none of the change in 
his pocket was dated past 1982 said lt dennis potter of the 
jefferson county sheriffs department 
we were amazed at the place where he was found you could look 
out over this ledge and see this beautiful panoramic vista he was 
laying there fully skeletonized on his back in a very peaceful 
repose inside the overhang area he said 
authorities said he hiked four miles from where he left his 
vehicle at a trailhead temperatures were well below freezing that 
day and several inches of snow covered the area 
he could not have even survived the night the way he was 
dressed potter said 
we found no evidence that he built a fire found no matches or 
anything else for survival he said he just climbed up there 
laid down and died probably from exposure

more than 2000 troops will be 
deployed throughout manila to cope with what the national police 
commander on sunday called a breakdown in law and order in this 
turbulent capital 
in washington the state department warned that americans 
traveling in the philippines face an increased risk of terrorism as 
the two countries prepare for a new round of negotiations on us 
military bases in the island nation 
a statement issued by the military said maj gen cesar 
nazareno chief of the philippine constabulary told commanders a 
unit of about 2000 troops would be deployed in manila to curb a 
spate of bombings and killings 
officials said that by monday the troops would be stationed near 
key government installations to respond quickly to any incident 
it seems that we now have a breakdown in law and order 
nazareno was quoted as saying 
the move follows escalating violence blamed on both communist 
rebels and rightwing military dissidents responsible for last 
decembers bloody coup attempt in which at least 113 people died 
and more than 600 were wounded 
in the latest incident suspected communist rebels killed a 
police sergeant sunday in the citys kalookan district 
last monday powerful bombs were defused outside two bank 
headquarters in the financial district makati two days later a 
filipino colonel and four other people were killed in an ambush on 
the citys busiest thoroughfare 
on thursday a bomb injured a marine near armed forces 
headquarters and friday two police were ambushed and slain 
police blame the two ambushes on communist rebels and the bombs 
on military renegades 
on friday the revolutionary alliance of the masses a military 
group that purportedly led the dec 19 coup attempt threatened to 
kill banker domingo lee for alleged crimes against the people 
lees bank philbanking corp was the target of one of the 
bombs defused on monday lee is a leading figure in the 
filipinochinese business community and a strong supporter of 
president corazon aquino 
in a statement sunday the shadowy young officers union 
another military group linked to the december coup attempt did not 
explicitly deny the mutineers were behind the bombings 
but the union also implied the bombs were planted by government 
supporters to justify extending mrs aquinos emergency powers 
which expire next month 
congress granted the special powers after the december coup 
attempt and last week the cabinet decided to ask congress to 
extend some of them for six months 
some of the violence has been directed at americans and the 
us state department said attacks could increase as the countries 
prepare for more talks on extending the lease on six us military 
bases 
us and philippine negotiators finished the first round of 
talks may 18 and more are expected by july 
during this period communist elements in the philippines are 
likely to expand their current terrorism campaign beyond us 
officials and active duty us servicemen to include retired 
personnel and the places they frequent the state department said 
in a statement issued in washington 
the us embassy estimates there are about 140000 americans in 
the philippines including 40000 troops military dependents and 
defense department civilians at the six bases 
in the statement the state department said most of the major 
tourist destinations and most urban areas were generally free of 
civil disorder 
but it said because of criminal activities travelers should 
exercise caution at night in the downtown entertainment districts 
of major cities and should avoid travel to remote mountainous 
areas 
a number of us businesses and offices are in manilas 
entertainment district including the us embassy and offices of 
the associated press 
eight americans have been slain in politically motivated 
violence since april 1989 they include two us airmen slain by 
communist rebels may 13 on the eve of the first round of base talks

a sheriffs deputy resigned and an ohio 
restaurateur killed himself after their names turned up on a list 
of a male prostitution ring that authorities say involved customers 
from 39 states 
indianapolis police also have fielded phone calls from men who 
fear they might be on the list of patrons and prostitutes 
investigators found in the car of james w dayton the rings 
suspected organizer who died after having sex with a prospective 
escort 
no arrests have been made as police and prosecutors study the 
reams of evidence confiscated from daytons car and his 
indianapolis apartment but arrests could come as early as this 
week investigators said friday 
those who agree to cooperate with the investigation could be 
offered plea bargains said j michael loomis the marion county 
deputy prosecutor heading the investigation 
but many of the about 400 people investigators believe solicited 
escorts from the ring never will be identified for the list 
carries many aliases or just first names 
dayton a 44yearold computer technician who worked for the 
naval avionics center is believed to have built a network of more 
than 100 prostitutes through messages on computer billboards and 
solicited patrons by advertising two escort services in homosexual 
publications 
the prostitutes many of whom were bodybuilders earned fees 
ranging from 150 to 500 dayton earned a cut of nearly 25 
percent said police spokesman andrew stoner 
dayton died of a heart attack march 16 in a tiffin ohio inn 
after engaging in sex with a man who wanted to join the ring as a 
prostitute authorities said 
in his car trunk investigators found 140 pages of 
computergenerated job applications for the escort services as well 
as names addresses telephone numbers and nude pictures 
richard gates a marion county sheriffs deputy resigned may 11 
after being confronted with news that his name had turned up on 
daytons list of clients and employees a 25year veteran of the 
sheriffs department he chose to retire with his pension rather 
than face an internal affairs investigation 
another person whose name turned up was chris berman owner of a 
popular restaurant in the toledo suburb of walbridge berman 
committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage a day 
after a reporter called to ask about his possible involvement with 
the prostitution ring 
police believe some evidence might have been removed from 
daytons apartment but stoner said the missing evidence has had no 
significant effect on the investigation 
daytons records show customers from 39 states canada guam and 
south korea but most of the activity was concentrated in indiana 
ohio and michigan 
indianapolis police were tipped to daytons activities in july 
1986 but were never able to infiltrate the ring dayton insisted 
that prospective prostitutes have sex with him or provide explicit 
photographs and body measurements and police were unwilling to 
compromise an officer or informant stoner said 
daytons only arrest came in september 1987 after he fondled an 
undercover marion county sheriffs deputy stoner said he pleaded 
guilty to indecent exposure and paid 150 in fines 
investigators believe the ring ceased operating with daytons 
death 
authorities have asked that patrons and prostitutes involved in 
the ring to call the police vice squad 
its been an overwhelming success loomis said estimating 
that 50 calls had been received by friday some from lawyers who 
represent more than one participant 
marion county prosecutor stephen goldsmith has publicly urged 
all participants in the ring to be tested for the aids virus 
a medical card found in daytons possession indicates he tested 
negative for the virus but police say one of the participants has 
tested positive for the deadly disease 
goldsmith has come under fire for saying acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome testing may become a condition for immunity 
from prosecution 
hes way out of his bailiwick if he thinks someones going to 
come in and take an hiv test under threat of prosecution said 
stan berg publisher of the homosexual publication the new works 
news which circulates 7000 copies primarily in the midwest 
loomis countered were attempting as best we can to separate 
law enforcement issues from health issues we strongly urge and 
encourage persons to be tested clearly we would prefer that 
persons voluntarily submit to hiv screening 
berg said he knows a few men who were involved in daytons 
operation as escorts and he questioned the scope of the operation 
that authorities have presented 
a lot of it was just older men who wanted to take a pretty 
boy out to dinner berg said some have indicated there was 
surprisingly little sex involved

mayor david dinkins calm and determined hoped 
to inspire the same mood in the city with two speeches championing 
racial harmony but some critics say bigotry can be fought only 
with anger 
its time to come together to create a wave of unity so 
powerful it can wash away the hate the mayor told a packed 
sanctuary at the cathedral of st john the divine last tuesday 
three black activists were quick to reject his call ridiculing 
dinkins and the idea of racial harmony we intend not to turn the 
thermostat down but to turn it up said attorney c vernon mason 
he was joined by alton h maddox another attorney and the rev 
al sharpton who has led angry protesters through bensonhurst the 
neighborhood in brooklyn where a black teen was killed by a mob of 
whites 
any black man who advocates racial harmony is out of his 
mind said maddox 
the citys first black mayor and the three activists embrace 
radically different approaches in handling the social injustices 
afflicting minorities in the city but each has a role to play in 
ultimately improving race relations says a specialist in urban 
studies 
you need a combination of militancy and moderation said 
william kornblum director of the center for social research at the 
city university graduate center in manhattan 
if its all moderation there is no change he said if 
its all militancy there will be no understanding 
wilbert tatum publisher of the amsterdam news says mason 
maddox and sharpton have raised the consciousness of the city 
people now realize they have no choice but to confront racism 
tatum said and will therefore listen to the reasonable voice of 
dinkins 
if mason maddox and sharpton did not exist david dinkins 
could not exist tatum said 
racial tensions in the city reached a crescendo with the trial 
of two young white men charged with killing 16yearold yusuf 
hawkins the relief that swept the city with joseph famas murder 
conviction turned to rage with the acquittal of keith mondello a 
day later on murder and manslaughter charges 
demonstrators shouting no justice no peace ran through the 
streets after the mondello verdict came in knocking over trash 
cans and attacking reporters and television news vans 
and there may be more to come six more youths face charges in 
hawkins aug 23 murder five of them including john vento 21 
are charged with murder ventos trial is scheduled for june 11 
the city also has been unsettled by a black boycott of two 
koreanamerican grocers that began after a haitianamerican woman 
accused a shopowner of assaulting her in an argument over a 
dollars worth of fruit 
the boycott heated up about the same time a white professor gave 
a lecture at long island universitys brooklyn campus in which he 
said that whites are intellectually superior to blacks the result 
was a near riot 
while all this was going on pulitzer prizewinning columnist 
jimmy breslin was suspended for two weeks by newsday executives for 
hurling racist and sexist slurs at an asianamerican coworker 
those incidents sparked dinkins address tuesday call for 
harmony his second speech in less than two weeks condemning 
racism on may 11 in a locally televised speech he appealed to 
new yorkers for racial unity 
we will never allow any group or any person to turn to 
violence or the threat of violence to intimidate others no matter 
how legitimate their anger or frustration may be the mayor said 
on thursday dinkins proposed a record 279 billion budget 
including a 780000 increase for the citys human rights 
commission the money will help fund teams to respond to racial 
ethnic religious or gender bias incidents 
you cant put everything on david dinkins to change the city 
people must change themselves said peter williams a project 
associate at the center for law and social justice at medgar evers 
college 
but he can take steps to change the problems stronger 
standards for institutions that discriminate against people of 
color and discriminatory lending by banks are examples of things he 
could be addressing

a prodemocracy opposition party whose 
leaders are being held by the military government took an early 
lead sunday in burmas first multiparty elections in 30 years 
supporters of the national league for democracy cheered and 
danced in the streets as the first official results were announced 
on state radio giving the party victories in three of the 492 
races for seats in the national legislature 
the election was called by the military government which seized 
power in september 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwide 
prodemocracy uprising 
the military rulers have said they will hand over power to a 
civilian government but over the past 20 months the government has 
imprisoned and intimidated political opponents 
sundays election proceeded without any reports of violence or 
military shows of force however the government imposed a curfew 
on the capital after 10 hours of voting and four hours of 
handcounting ballots 
the early returns indicated the opposition league was winning by 
wide margins in the capitals seikan constituency it took 60 
percent of the vote to 35 percent for the promilitary national 
unity party official rangoon radio said 
the league said it was certain it had won 16 victories in 
rangoons 61 constituencies preliminary indications from other 
major cities also suggested voters had rejected the promilitary 
party it said 
results from the countryside home to about 70 percent of 
burmas 41 million people were less predictable some analysts 
said the promilitary party could make a strong showing there 
a final tally could take up to three weeks officials said 
initial reports from polling officials indicated the turnout in 
major cities ranged from 60 percent to 70 percent 
in interviews in the capital older burmese generally declined 
to say how they had voted but younger voters uniformly said they 
had cast ballots for one of the prodemocracy opposition parties 
the military government has detained two leaders of the national 
league for democracy aung san suu kyi the highly popular daughter 
of independence hero aung san is under house arrest and tin oo is 
in prison 
former civilian prime minister nu also is under house arrest 
although the government rejected requests for foreign official 
observers at the polls there was no sign of interference or 
intimidation at rangoon voting stations visited by foreign 
correspondents 
sources in other major cities also said there were no problems 
the voting went smoothly and well all over the country 
rangoon radio said as it announced the first official results 
as far as i can see its very fair said a young woman 
teacher as she emerged from a polling area 
some ethnic minority rebel and student dissident groups 
boycotted sundays elections however rebel sources in bangkok 
said on saturday that the rebels had called off earlier plans to 
sabotage polling 
the 492 parliamentary seats were contested by 2297 candidates 
from 93 parties only half a dozen of the parties were expected to 
make a significant showing however 
the military government has said it will hand over power after 
the new legislature approves a constitution and new elections for a 
civilian government are held under the documents provisions 
asked if he would allow a civilian government to run the 
country junta leader gen saw maung said sunday i have already 
abided by my promise 
i will transfer power according to the law he said on 
emerging from a central rangoon polling booth 
before the curfew was imposed national league for democracy 
backers celebrated their early wins at party headquarters people 
cheered and danced in the street in front of the rundown party 
building 
im so happy one young party member said im not 
surprised though because we knew the people would vote for us 
this is what we we expected 
myint u an official of the league said if the party won the 
election it would seek the release of political prisoners he said 
about 400 party members were imprisoned along with other dissidents 
many foreign human rights and legal organizations have accused 
the rangoon leaders of widespread human rights abuses the 
government has denied the allegations 
the military has held power in burma since a 1962 coup by gen 
ne win whose burmese way to socialism program included 
military control ruinous socialist economics and isolation from 
the rest of the world 
although endowed with rich natural resources burma is now among 
the worlds poorest nations 
the military rulers have liberalized the economy and expanded 
commercial dealing with foreign countries while maintaining tight 
internal political control

mary hendersons body was under attack by a 
bacteria that kills up to 100000 americans each year and her 
family gathered at her hospital bedside as she began slipping 
toward death 
but her life was saved because one of her physicians had heard 
about an experimental drug for hendersons infection during a 
lunchtime conversation earlier that day federal officials gave 
quick approval for her to be given the drug and a month later 
shes at home 
im still kind of in a stupor walking around my apartment 
henderson 55 of santa monica said thursday in a telephone 
interview im saying hey i made it 
her doctors said the bacteria infection called gramnegative 
sepsis developed after hendersons immune system was weakened by 
chemotherapy for cancer of the lymph system 
she was on the brink of death there is no doubt about that 
said dr george fareed it was fareed who told dr peter boasberg 
one of hendersons physicians about the sepsis treatment being 
tested by xoma corp where fareed is director of new product 
development 
when hendersons body began failing the afternoon of april 23 
boasberg called fareed at his santa monica office to ask if he 
could get hold of the drug they had discussed at lunchtime 
xomene5 
a hurried round of phone calls followed to xomas berkeley 
headquarters and the us food and drug administration seeking a 
waiver to administer the experimental drug under a compassionate 
use exemption fareed said 
final approvals were given within four hours and arrangements 
made for a xoma employee to fly the drug to santa monica 
it was incredible said another of hendersons doctors dr 
leonard fromer she was on deaths doorstep and she got this 
drug at midnight and four hours later every objective sign of her 
condition was improved 
i fully believe she would have died without the drug 
the infectioncausing bacteria called gramnegative because 
cells dont hold a dye in a laboratory staining procedure 
conventionally have been attacked with antibiotics 
but that treatment while killing the bacteria fails to attack 
toxins the organism produces of 200000 gramnegative sepsis cases 
each year in the united states an estimated 80000 to 100000 
result in death fareed said 
the new drug from xoma and one developed by another company 
centocor inc of malvern pa bind to the toxins and block their 
effect 
xoma and centocor which manufactures centoxin are seeking fda 
approval for the drugs 
dr harvey rubin an infectious disease specialist at the 
university of pennsylvania who was involved in trials of centoxin 
called the new treatment exciting but said it requires further 
study 
the clinical trials were quite small we have to wait for many 
more people in wider trials before we can definitely say this is 
unequivocally efficacious he said friday 
dr elizabeth ziegler a professor of medicine in the infectious 
diseases division of the university of california san diego 
worked on the original testing of the antibody used in centoxin and 
on clinical trials 
she also said the new approach is promising but stressed that 
it is an adjunct to traditional treatment and that not all sepsis 
deaths can be prevented 
henderson still has a medical battle to fight she is undergoing 
tests that could lead to a bone marrow procedure aimed at wiping 
out her cancer 
but she said her recovery from gramnegative sepsis has given 
her hope 
i feel very confident with drs boasberg and fromer she 
said its reaffirming that they are committed to their patients 
its a great feeling at this point in my life

an assistant attorney general garbed in 
traditional cap and gown gave a graduation speech that ended with 
him balanced upside down atop four chairs 
it wasnt his parttime work as a lawyer that got sam kilbourn 
the gig as commencement speaker saturday at gould academy it was 
his work as a professional clown one who describes his brand of 
performing as a cross between pantomime clowning and acrobatics he 
dubs pantoclowning 
its an alternative to a talking head at a podium said 
kilbourn 
the impression he wanted to get across in his talkless 
satirization of a graduation speech was that the students should 
challenge themselves take risks and believe in themselves he said 
the idea for the offbeat commencement address came from the 
western maine prep schools headmaster william d klough iii 
some of this weekends 64 gould graduates said the performance 
made an impression 
it was pretty incredible didnt ever know what to expect it 
kept us on our toes said kevin davis class valedictorian 
kilbourn 46 graduated from yale university in 1965 where he 
was captain of the gymnastics club he earned his law degree in 
1971 from cornell where he was a law review editor 
but by 1979 kilbourn had quit his fulltime job at a law firm 
and gone into clowning professionally 
for the past few years hes been working with a fiveman 
traveling performance team called the wright bros 
we dont have an easily identifiable niche we in the industry 
call it new vaudeville kilbourn said 
the wright bros takes up most of his time anywhere from 40 to 
90 hours a week but kilbourn said he decided in 1988 to return to 
law parttime in order make extra money 
a frequent lecturer at continuing legal education seminars for 
lawyers and paralegal professionals kilbourn works three or four 
days a week in the natural resources division at the attorney 
generals office in augusta concentrating on real estate cases

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
sunday the united states still supports having the united nations 
investigate the treatment of palestinians in israels occupied 
territories 
baker said the united states supports an investigation conducted 
in the west bank and gaza at the behest of the un 
secretarygeneral but he drew a distinction between a mission 
dispatched by the secretarygeneral and a mission sent by the un 
security council 
i hope that the arab leadership and i hope that the government 
of israel will both support the idea of sending an investigative 
mission from the secretarygeneral to the territories and report 
back he said 
that is something the united states will support and i hope 
that we can see the parties come together on that baker said 
bakers comments on cbstvs face the nation program came 
the day after the united states blocked an attempt by the security 
council to send a mission to the occupied territories 
arab leaders were angered by the us move at the security 
council meeting in geneva switzerland and they claimed baker had 
reneged on a promise 
the united states objected to the investigative mission after 
israel refused to accept any team sent by the security council 
baker said arabs must have misunderstood what they thought 
was his earlier backing of a security council investigative team 
arab countries this week called for un protection of 
palestinians living in the occupied territories at least 15 
palestinians have been killed in clashes with israeli defense 
forces in the past week 
on saturday kidnappers holding two american hostages in lebanon 
blamed the united states for the massacre of seven palestinian 
workers in israel on may 20 israeli officials have said the 
accused gunman a former soldier apparently was deranged 
in a statement issued saturday in beirut the organization of 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine vowed to make the 
united states and israel pay the price for the killings 
however the group did not threaten hostages jesse turner and allan 
steen 
meantime israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir reiterated his 
opposition to any un peacekeeping forces or other observers in 
the occupied territories 
i dont think we need peacekeeping forces for having peace 
he said our experience is that such forces are not bringing 
peace they are causing tensions and not peace 
we dont need foreign military men to police the country the 
area we need peaceful talks thats all

hundreds of people dropped 
flowers into the north sea over the weekend during a solemn 
memorial for the 158 people who died in a ferry fire last month 
that probably was set by an arsonist 
the scandinavian star was engulfed in flames midway on its 
overnight run from oslo norway to frederikshavn denmark most of 
the victims were norwegians 
about 300 people including survivors and relatives of people 
who died in the disaster lined the rail of this ship during a 
sunset memorial service on saturday 
the twoday memorial voyage was arranged by a survivors support 
group and clergymen and psychologists helped comfort those 
mourning the people who died aboard the scandinavian star ferry 
when a fire raced through it on april 7 
i have been here before a month and half ago when like all 
of us in our own ways i was marked for life said survivor grete 
holen 
as the king of scandinavia cut its motors and stopped in the 
north sea where the disaster occurred she said we are bound 
together by a meaningless tragedy all of us have had a piece of us 
ripped out forever 
an american entertainer ruth e rome 27 of east lansing 
mich was among the casualties 
police believe the fire was set a dane with a history of mental 
disorders and pyromania died in the inferno leading police to 
theorize that he may have been the arsonist the investigation is 
continuing 
i think of all the people who died so needlessly i think of 
the seconds and millimeters we were from dying said tore 
netteland as the car and passenger ferry sailed the route of the 
scandinavian star 
some returned to the site of the tragedy to help cope with grief 
or fear others said they came to say farewell 
ms holen expressed anger about safety rules that allowed the 
scandinavian star to sail the ferry registered under a flag of 
convenience was unprepared to handle a disaster investigators say 
a marine inquiry heard a catalog of safety omissions and 
blunders that may have helped the fire spread and hinder rescue 
operations the norwegian captain was found to have abandoned the 
ship while passengers remained alive on board 
our private sorrow is one thing the public side of this is 
that we want the world to know that there is a lesson in this 
tragedy ms holen said calling for tougher safety regulations 
a commission of representatives from norway denmark and sweden 
ordered regulations tightened for ferry traffic in scandinavian 
waters

pakistans troubled sindh province 
exploded in violence sunday that left at least 82 people dead and 
more than 275 hurt in two cities authorities and witnesses said 
in hyderabad in southern sindh security forces on sunday shot 
and killed 60 people and wounded more than 200 who defied a 
13dayold curfew imposed to curb ethnic violence police and 
witnesses said 
in the provinces capital karachi 150 miles to the south at 
least 22 people were killed and 75 others wounded in sniper attacks 
sunday officials said authorities clamped curfews on three of the 
most violent districts 
much of the province has been hit in recent years by a wave of 
kidnappings assassinations and sniper attacks that have left more 
than 2000 people dead 
the violence in hyderabad broke out sunday after moslem leaders 
used loudspeakers at neighborhood mosques to call residents into 
the streets 
hundreds of people many clutching the moslem holy book the 
koran poured out of their homes police and witnesses said 
the shooting set off gun battles between residents and troops 
patrolling the city police and witnesses said and the army moved 
in to restore order 
opposition politicians in parliament demanded the dismissal of 
provincial government officials and called for a state of emergency 
to be declared in sindh prime minister benazir bhuttos home 
province 
in the past two weeks gun battles have brought life to a 
standstill for hyderabads 3 million residents 
the curfew violators in hyderabad on sunday were demanding 
restoration of water and power and trying to get food security 
forces warned people to go back inside and opened fire when the 
warnings were ignored witnesses said 
ambulances rushed victims to a nearby hospital but doctors said 
they could not treat them all 
as word of the shooting spread witnesses said furious 
residents began taking potshots at paramilitary troops riot police 
and rangers 
people were trying to break through police barricades and 
shooting from their rooftops said one witness speaking on 
condition of anonymity the situation got totally out of 
control 
after five hours witnesses said the army moved in 
earlier sunday in karachi pakistans largest city snipers 
launched a series of attacks beginning early in the morning firing 
at pedestrians and vehicles authorities refused to say who might 
be responsible 
most shops and businesses closed when the shooting started they 
said 
no one has claimed responsibility but police frequently blame 
violence on a militant faction of the mohajir qami movement or 
mqm a small political party representing descendants of moslem 
indians who immigrated to pakistan during the 1947 partition of the 
subcontinent 
the group is demanding recognition as pakistans fifth 
nationality along with the punjabis pathans sindhis and baluch 
thousands of troops swept across sindh last week and arrested 
more than 800 people including members of the mqm and ms bhuttos 
pakistan peoples party 
the mqm once backed ms bhuttos government but withdrew its 
support in november forcing a noconfidence vote the prime 
minister narrowly survived 
many residents believe the problem in sindh is beyond the 
governments control authorities have never made arrests in a 
massacre on sept 30 1988 that left at least 300 dead in hyderabad 
ms bhutto acknowledged that the provincial government has not 
done enough to curb the escalating violence and lawlessness but 
she accused neighboring india of stirring up trouble in sindh and 
the eastern province of punjab 
new delhi denies those allegations and blames pakistan for 
violent separatist movements in indian punjab and jammukashmir 
indias only moslem majority state pakistan denies the charges

in scenes grimly reminiscent of the 
nations largest unsolved serial murder case police are 
investigating the deaths of three prostitutes dumped near the 
spokane river 
similarities exist between this case and the unsolved green 
river slayings that stopped six years ago in the seattle area but 
investigators doubt theyre linked 
still police in spokane are handling the latest case as the 
work of a serial killer 
it comes as no surprise to seasoned investigators that another 
serial killer may be active in the pacific northwest 
the northwest is a particularly attractive area for a serial 
killer to traverse said capt t michael nault head of a unit 
that includes the green river task force based in seattle 300 
miles west of spokane that is primarily because of the regions 
perceived remoteness its lesser per capita law enforcement and 
even its reputation for a more laidback law enforcement 
a detective from the green river unit will meet soon with 
spokane investigators to point out potential pitfalls said lt jim 
hill head of major crimes investigations for spokane police 
nault hill and others see no apparent links between the 
slayings of the three women in spokane and the green river case 
but as nault put it its reckless to say there is no 
possibility 
police are investigating eight sets of serial killings on the 
west coast nault said 
the green river serial killer is blamed in the deaths and 
disappearances of as many as 49 women in the pacific northwest 
between mid1982 and early 1984 many of them prostitutes 
the first spokane river victim turned up in february and the 
most recent earlier this month all three women who had police 
records for soliciting were shot several times with a small 
caliber weapon before their naked or seminude bodies were dumped 
police said 
we were a little better off than the green river investigation 
because we had the slayings associated with a serial crime right 
away hill said we have a computer program that has been in 
place since the second incident its a matter of making sure we 
dont repeat someone elses errors 
police in king county where many of the green river victims 
were found were criticized for not recognizing soon enough that a 
serial killer was loose 
spokane investigators began looking into a possible serial crime 
after the second body that of nickie lowe 34 was found march 25 
by the time the body of the third victim kathleen a brisbois 
38 was found may 15 police had met with the spokane county 
sheriffs department which contributed a detective to the 
investigation the body of the first woman 26yearold yolanda 
sapp was found on a riverbank feb 22 
except for the first five bodies found in or near the green 
river in august 1982 police found only skeletal remains making 
clues harder to find in that case 
the spokane river remains were found within days or hours of 
death which could yield better clues 
the rule of thumb is the sooner you get it the more likely 
you are to resolve it said hill thats true whether its a 
homicide or a robbery or burglary

with prayers hymns and tears thousands 
of veterans of the dunkirk evacuation assembled on a oncebloody 
beachfront sunday to honor comrades killed 50 years ago in one of 
world war iis most crucial operations 
the veterans most british and many supporting themselves with 
canes or umbrellas watched as a royal navy helicopter dropped a 
wreath of poppies over a circle of dozens of the ships that helped 
rescue trapped allied troops in 1940 
the former soldiers were deployed in ranks under their 
regimental standards and a chorus of god save the queen echoed 
over the waves 
at least 15000 people including relatives and onlookers were 
present 
the veterans marched or rode to the beach after a ceremony in 
the city center rebuilt from near destruction in the nazi 
bombardment that chased the allied soldiers to the seaside as 
france fell to germany 
some of us have been here before lord donald kaberry 
president of the dunkirk veterans association told the assembled 
french belgian dutch australian and british veterans 
we were here 50 years ago when we crossed the beaches and 
went back to the united kingdom to regroup fight again and win 
said kaberry 82 
he was an acting major in the british expeditionary force when 
he was evacuated with 338000 other allied troops in what became 
known as the miracle of dunkirk 
about 6000 british veterans and their relatives descended on 
the port city in far northern france for weekend celebrations 
commemorating operation dynamo 
it began when a ragtag fleet of 800 naval vessels barges 
fishing boats and pleasure craft rallied to winston churchills 
call to save the allied armies from the encircling wehrmacht 
on thursday seventythree ships many involved in the 
operation braved choppy channel waters to cross from dover to 
dunkirk and join the commemorations most were able to muster in a 
circle offshore sunday 
dignitaries on hand included dunkirk mayor michel delabarre who 
is frances transport minister and british transport secretary 
cecil parkinson 
for the veterans the return to dunkirk was a time to reflect on 
the war their comrades who died and their own luck in having 
survived 
william bannister then a 20yearold sapper in the kings own 
royal regiment had gone without food for two days when he finally 
made it aboard the british destroyer hms esk and curled up under a 
gun turret to sleep 
moments later the ship was attacked by german dive bombers 
fortunately they were all near misses i just went to sleep 
even though that gun was going off all the while it didnt wake me 
up i didnt move until i got back to dover 
many of the survivors such as 71yearold former sgt james 
wright went on to fight in north africa italy and normandy 
wright recalled dunkirk in may 1940 as a crushed city pounded 
to rubble by german bombers and artillery littered with burning 
vehicles bodies of thousands of civilians and soldiers dotting the 
beaches and streets 
the first time i was here it was in ruins all burning he 
said gazing at the modern brick buildings decked with french and 
british flags that now form the city center 
english fisherman george osborne 76 said he makes an annual 
trip to dunkirk 
injured in a shipboard accident he stayed behind when his two 
brothers and three cousins crossed the channel in their fishing 
boat toward the besieged beaches a german mine blew them to pieces 
it doesnt seem like 50 years ago he said choking back 
tears it seems like yesterday when i come back here i feel 
like im with them again

i went right out there to ask who that person was and she 
said he told me to get in the car hed drive me to school he 
showed me money mom a bunch of it she told the newspaper

probably really less than a second said the mother he took 
off and i took off after him at about 70 75 miles an hour

millions of people ignored terrorist 
threats and voted sunday in a presidential election that will 
determine the course of the nations war against the powerful drug 
cartels and their hired killers 
under the watchful eye of army sharpshooters women with babies 
in their arms joined other colombians in choosing among 12 
candidates who survived a campaign in which three of their rivals 
were shot and killed 
guerrilla groups also have been blamed for campaign attacks and 
there was scattered rebel violence in remote villages saturday 
night and before dawn sunday four policemen were reported wounded 
and seven were missing in the attacks according to radio reports 
the main issue that divided the four top candidates was whether 
to continue the governments harsh crackdown on drug traffickers 
and its policy of extraditing top dealers to the united states for 
prosecution 
cesar gaviria 43 the candidate of the governing liberal party 
who has pledged to continue the crackdown led all independent 
polls and was expected to easily win the election 
the candidate with the most votes wins even if he fails to 
garner more than 50 percent of the ballots 
colombians also voted on whether to call a national assembly to 
make changes in colombias 104yearold constitution the new 
president would decide which political parties and other groups 
should appoint the assembly which would act independently of the 
nations standing elected congress 
the radio network caracol said sunday afternoon that based on a 
poll it was projecting approval of the constitutional assembly by 
more than 90 percent of the voters 
proponents of constitutional reform say changes are needed to 
break the upper classs grip on this country proposed changes 
would strengthen the judicial system emphasize land reform and 
increase checks and balances in the government colombias 
president now has wide powers that easily allow him to sidestep 
congress and the supreme court 
the polls opened at 8 am and preliminary results were expected 
an hour or so after polls closed at 5 pm 6 pm edt more than 
13 million people were eligible to vote but turnout figures were 
not immediately available 
the vote was suspended in four villages because of guerrilla 
incursions government and army officials were quoted as telling 
the national radio networks rcn and caracol the rebels also 
ambushed police patrols near three more villages the reports said 
as the polls opened in the capital bogota mayor andres pastrana 
declared one minute of silence for the three assassinated 
presidential candidates 
a police bugler played taps during the ceremony at the huge 
bolivar plaza causing many in the crowd of hundreds to weep openly 
besides the three presidential candidates 262 policemen 93 
soldiers three judges 15 news media employees and about 1700 
other people have been slain in the past nine months bombs have 
exploded at schools churches and stores one bomb killed 107 
people on a colombian jetliner 
in the two weeks leading up to sundays balloting nine bombs 
exploded in four colombian cities killing 37 people and wounding 
more than 320 
few of the crimes have been solved but suspicion for most of 
the killings has fallen on drug traffickers who have private 
armies and billions of dollars in cocaine profits at their 
disposal and who hoped to disrupt the election 
president virgilio barco who is prohibited from seeking a 
second consecutive fouryear term voted along with his wife in the 
plaza 
several hours earlier he went on national television to appeal 
to voters to show courage and come out to vote 
my countrymen never before has it been so clear that the 
future of colombia is in your hands all of us must vote he 
said to vote is to support democracy to reject violence and to 
defend the rights that the terrorists want to snatch from us 
i do not have the slightest doubt that both the terrorist acts 
aimed at taking the lives of presidential candidates as well as 
those committed against other compatriots have been carried out to 
intimidate the popular will 
an armed force of 232000 men was put on alert several days 
before the election troops were seen throughout the capital of 6 
million people 
police and army sharpshooters were crouched on the roofs of 
buildings near many voting booths early sunday 
the four main candidates were gaviria rodrigo lloreda 48 
alvaro gomez 71 and antonio navarro 41 
gaviria became the liberal party candidate after luis carlos 
galan assassination by drug traffickers on aug 18 his killing 
prompted the government to declare war on the drug cartels 
lloreda a former foreign minister has said he would end 
extradition of trafficking suspects to the united states lloreda 
represents the conservative party the countrys secondlargest 
party 
gomez broke from the conservative party to run as an 
independent he too has suggested that he would end extraditions 
he wants cocaine legalized in the united states and other 
countries saying this would deprive the traffickers of profits 
they use to terrorize colombia and undermine its democracy 
navarro was one of the leaders the april 19 movement guerrilla 
group known as the m19 the rebel group disbanded earlier this 
year in exchange for pardons and the right to form a political 
party 
navarro stepped in when the partys first presidential 
candidate carlos pizarro was assassinated on april 26 in a 
killing blamed on drug traffickers navarro favors continuing the 
governments crackdown 
the third presidential candidate assassinated was bernardo 
jaramillo of the patriotic union party he was slain march 22 the 
party its ranks decimated by rightwing death squads withdrew 
from the election 
the police said drug traffickers killed jaramillo

a clash between supporters of a 
fledgling opposition party and security forces left six 
demonstrators dead and an unspecified number of police injured in a 
city northwest of here staterun radio said sunday 
cameroon is the latest of frances former african colonies where 
an opposition movement has called on an authoritarian government to 
make political reforms 
the radio said demonstrators were trampled to death in 
saturdays clash but witnesses said they were shot by police 
the radio also claimed the demonstrators stoned and clubbed 
unarmed police burned police vehicles and set up barricades before 
reinforcements arrived to subdue the protesters 
the clash came after supporters of the newly formed democratic 
social front assembled in bamenda in an englishspeaking area 36 
miles east of the nigerian frontier authorities had warned the 
group not to try to hold political meetings 
president paul biya who has ruled since november 1982 has 
refused to allow any opposition parties to organize 
although the countrys constitution allows such parties biyas 
cameroon democratic peoples movement is the only legal party 
in april a lawyer and 10 other people were convicted of 
subversion after trying to organize an opposition party 
soldiers prevented the public from watching the rial and one of 
the defense lawyers was shot dead at a roadblock on the day the 
convictions were handed down 
the cameroon bar association has called on the government to 
tolerate opposition but has been warned that it should remain out 
of politics 
the democratic social front was first formed three months ago by 
a bamenda publisher john frundi he filed papers to create his 
party with government authorities and was told it would take two 
months to examine them 
two weeks ago having received no reply he said he was going 
ahead with organization of the party 
cameroon gained independence from france in 1960 but the former 
british cameroons did not become part of the country until 1961 
part of it was incorporated into nigeria and a strip along the 
eastern nigerian border was made part of cameroon

african national congress guerrilla 
commanders and veteran officers of the whiteled south african army 
ended an unprecedented conference sunday pledging to work for peace 
in a joint statement released in the zambian capital after five 
days of talks the two sides declared there should be a mutually 
binding cessation of hostilities as soon as possible 
the conference convened to discuss the present and future role 
of the security forces went ahead without the blessing of south 
african defense minister magnus malan 
but the 48 current and former military officers who attended 
said they would make recommendations privately to the government on 
their return home 
the participants said they envisioned a ceasefire agreement 
under which the anc military wing would halt guerrilla attacks and 
sabotage while the south african army would remove troops from 
black townships and halt searchandkill operations 
before departing for home late sunday the officers said they 
had developed friendships with the guerrillas one cubantrained 
anc fighter said he was impressed with the frankness of the talks 
and the warm atmosphere 
weve always told ourselves that if we ever came across an 
sadf man anywhere it would be a question of who was faster said 
the man who identified himself only as duncan he referred to the 
south african defense force 
lusaka was chosen as the location for the conference because it 
is close to south africa and is home to the external headquarters 
of the anc the largest movement fighting to end south africas 
apartheid policies 
the lusaka meeting was the latest example of easing hostilities 
between south africas white minority which controls political and 
economic power and the 28 million voteless black majority 
the anc and other antiapartheid movements were legalized in 
february anc leader nelson mandela was also freed from 27 years 
imprisonment for antigovernment activities 
earlier this month both mandela and president fw de klerk 
architect of the reforms began talks on the political future of 
south africa military crackdowns on activists in black townships 
postponed the first planned meeting 
in lusaka the two sides agreed that once progress has been made 
in political discussions anc guerrillas should be permitted to 
return to south africa and integrated into the existing army or 
demobilized 
a new restructured army of conventional troops and former 
guerrillas should be nonpartisan accountable to parliament and 
recruited and promoted on the basis of merit alone their joint 
statement said 
we began a process over the last few days of moving forward 
together anc foreign affairs chief thabo mbeki said we have 
an obligation to our people to sustain that process

a shiite moslem leader said sunday at 
least one of four british hostages in lebanon could be released if 
british prime minister margaret thatcher deports writer salman 
rushdie for allegedly defaming islam 
hussein musawi also said the may 19 massacre of seven 
palestinian laborers by an israeli gunman will hurt efforts to free 
the six american hostages in lebanon 
i believe and hope that some of the british hostages could be 
freed if margaret thatcher deported salman rushdie from england 
musawi said 
rushdie an indianborn naturalized briton was sentenced to 
death by irans revolutionary leader the late ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini in february 1989 for allegedly blaspheming islam in his 
novel the satanic verses 
she doesnt have to hand him over to us or send him to iran or 
syria he said it would be enough if she gave us proof that he 
has left the country 
she can send him anywhere she wants musawi said from his 
headquarters in the bekaa valley town of baalbek in east lebanon 
the britons and americans are among 16 westerners missing in 
lebanon most are held by proiranian shiite factions longestheld 
is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press he was kidnapped on march 16 1985 
iran severed relations with britain in february 1989 after 
britain accused the iranians of terrorism and protested khomeinis 
death threat rushdie has been in hiding under guard ever since 
iran and syria helped obtain the release last month of american 
hostages robert polhill and frank reed as goodwill gestures 
but the iranians have said no more americans will be freed until 
washington makes a reciprocal gesture president bush has refused 
citing his policy of not negotiating with terrorists and those who 
support them 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani on sunday reiterated irans 
accusation that the west had made no move to obtain the release of 
iranian lebanese and palestinian hostages to reciprocate for 
the release of american hostages 
rafsanjani referred to palestinians and lebanese shiite moslems 
held by israel and their christian allies in southern lebanon and 
four iranians kidnapped and missing in the christian enclave in 
lebanon in 1982 
i believe that the british unlike the americans are now 
behaving in a positive manner that may encourage the 
hostageholders to free a british hostage as a goodwill gesture 
musawi said 
musawi heads islamic amal a prosyrian faction within the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god believed the parent 
movement for the extremists holding westerners 
he is also reputed mentor of islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine a shiite faction that holds american educators jesse 
turner and alann steen 
musawi was believed to have been instrumental in securing the 
release of polhill april 22 but he urged kidnappers not to free 
reed after the us congress endorsed a united jerusalem as 
israels capital two days later 
musawi made his remarks as radical iranian newspapers in tehran 
said that any british effort to restore relations with tehran were 
pointless so long as mrs thatchers government defends rushdie 
londons efforts are doomed if they are directed to secure 
salman rushdies life the jomhuri islami daily said in an 
editorial 
the british captives are anglican church envoy terry waite who 
disappeared jan 20 1987 journalist john mccarthy kidnapped 
april 17 1986 exroyal air force pilot jack mann kidnapped may 
12 1989 and writer alec collett kidnapped march 25 1985 
musawis remarks came a day after the proiranian islamic jihad 
for the liberation of palestine said it would make the united 
states and israel pay the price for the killing the unarmed 
palestinians by a former israeli soldier 
this massacre will have a negative effect on the issue of the 
american hostages musawi said 
israelis cannot do anything without american backing this is 
how things are linked in the minds and thoughts of our people he 
said

a fire possibly started by a cigarette killed all 
five members of a young family and a visitor at their home sunday 
in the deadliest blaze in boston in 18 years officials said 
firefighters were on the scene about three minutes after the 
fire was reported in the wooden duplex but flames spread too fast 
for the occupants to be saved said fire commissioner leo stapleton 
these were old wooden buildings about 100 years old so the 
fire spread very quickly he said it raced right up the stairs 
into the bedrooms 
stapleton said he suspected a cigarette left in an overstuffed 
chair might have sparked the blaze 
we know one of the male occupants had been smoking earlier in 
the evening stapleton said we think right now the cause was 
careless smoking 
the fire leaped to an adjoining building and crossed an alley to 
a third building but no other injuries were reported stapleton 
said 
it was the worst blaze in the city since 1972 when nine 
firefighters died battling a fire at the hotel vendome stapleton 
said 
fire officials did not immediately identify the victims but said 
they were a couple both in their 20s and their three young 
daughters a man believed to be a friend of the family also died 
officials said 
a woman believed to be the young mothers sister escaped by 
climbing out a window and into an adjoining building

veterans and supporters took the first steps of 
hundredmile walks sunday in three states as they sought to remind 
the nation during the memorial day weekend that many soldiers have 
never come home 
were sure that we still have some prisoners in southeast 
asia were going to work at this thing till the day when some of 
them walk out of there said world war ii veteran charles walker 
four groups from chicago peoria madison wis and baldwin 
iowa are staging the event dubbed the walk of the warriors 
said mary buttry holub of warrenville who helped organize it 
the marchers plan to meet thursday in the northern illinois city 
of oregon and continue friday to the nearby lake ladonna 
campground where they plan to spend the weekend camping together 
before they started organizers were unsure how many people 
would participate in the walk in honor of prisoners of war and 
those declared missing in action 
a total of 2340 american servicemen remain unaccounted for in 
southeast asia said tom stack a member of the illinois vietnam 
veterans leadership program 
holub had just graduated from lisle high school west of chicago 
in 1965 when the vietnam war began to affect her directly and 
ultimately change her life in 1966 one of her best friends was 
killed 
we didnt believe it would happen wed just graduated and 
life was fun vietnam was so far away it wasnt part of our 
lives she said 
her brother joined the marines in 1969 the same year her cousin 
was killed in the war 
her brother came home but suffered from addiction to drugs 
alcoholism and what veterans call survivor guilt holub said 
but since then she said her brother has turned around his 
life is raising a family and devotes himself to the 
prisonerofwar issue a commitment shes also made 
i have two boys she said i dont want to give up my 
children to a foreign country and not get them back i have no 
problem letting them serve because i love my country but weve 
been lied to 
she noted that a pending house measure would amend the 1942 
missing personnel act to require the government to provide proof 
before declaring a soldier dead now the law allows a declaration 
of death after one year without proof she said 
stack said the marchers goal is to heighten that awareness so 
people will get involved to request of their officials congressmen 
and senators that they continue to work hard to explore this issue 
to the nth degree 
stack who wears a bracelet commemorating an air force colonel 
shot down over laos on april 25 1971 added i empathize for 
those family members who dont know there has to be an accounting 
if there are remains the remains should be returned if theyre 
alive they should be returned

thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts staged a 
rolling thunder rally sunday past the white house and the 
soviet and laotian embassies to protest the handling of americas 
missing in action from the vietnam war 
the effort is to keep alive before the public and the media an 
issue the white house is trying to lay to rest said ted sampley 
of kinston nc one of the organizers 
national park police estimated that 15000 people took part in 
the rally and an associated rock for freedom concert and 
demonstration held near the lincoln and vietnam memorials 
thousands of cyclists gathered shortly before noon at the 
pentagon before motoring past the white house along a 
policeapproved route 
police rejected a request for a permit for the cyclists to motor 
en masse past the soviet and laotian embassies claiming it would 
tie up traffic according to the events organizers 
nonetheless groups of five to 20 cyclists at a time rumbled in 
ad hoc thunder alley runs throughout the afternoon in front of 
the embassies where organizers handed out patches with skulls and 
crossbones to riders as they passed 
the authorities have done everything in their power to 
interfere with this thing said sampley who chairs a group 
called the national steering committee for american war veterans 
the state department did not want us over at the laotian 
embassy 
he said the embassy was targeted because laos never has 
answered publicly what became of the us prisoners they were 
holding at the end of the war 
about 2300 americans are now listed by the government as 
missing in action in the vietnam war which also included fighting 
in cambodia and laos the war ended in 1975 with communist 
victories in all three countries 
of the missing 537 were in laos when last seen most of them 
in areas then under control of north vietnamese forces according 
to us officials

solidarity leader lech walesa told 
striking train workers that their walkout is propelling the country 
toward civil war but the strikers rebuffed his appeal for a 
settlement and threatened new stoppages 
the solidarity labor unions leader also suggested that prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki might be forced to resign if the 
protests spread 
a week of sporadic strikes has crippled freight transport to 
polands baltic coast from the industrial south and czechoslovakia 
and hungary the army has been called in to move essential 
shipments 
walesa held a threehour meeting with the strikers who broke 
off talks with the government in warsaw a day earlier the 
solidarity labor leader who himself rose to prominence by leading 
the strike at the gdansk shipyard begged the workers to call off 
the walkout 
please do it for poland he said we dont want a civil 
war now and whats going on now is leading to it 
the new solidarity government has refused to even discuss the 
strikers pay demands it says they could scuttle the drastic 
economic reforms now under way strikers said they will carry out a 
new stoppage monday the solidarity railroad union urged members 
not to participate in the stoppage at midday monday the move is 
being spearheaded by the opzz union which was formerly backed by 
the old communist government 
the strike committee is also calling for a work stoppage on 
tuesday evening 
officials said thousands of the nations 400000 railroad 
workers were striking but could give no specific number transport 
officials have noted that it only takes a few strikers to snarl 
rail traffic 
walesa has charged that the strikers legitimate grievances are 
being manipulated by the opzz union whose chairman is a former 
communist party politburo member 
solidarity labor minister jacek kuron says the wage demands are 
inflationary 
i am willing to talk with everybody about everything 
except wages he said 
the strikers want to raise rail workers pay to 110 percent of 
the average national wage of about 79 monthly they are also 
seeking the dismissal of railroad directors installed by the former 
communist government whom they say are incompetent and hampering 
reforms 
walesa told the strikers the government cannot give in because 
there are others waiting in line for strikes 
the governments concession would be an indication that if 
one goes on strike one gets whatever one wants the prime minister 
will resign if protests spread walesa said 
mazowiecki has repeatedly voiced sympathy poles suffering 
hardship during the 5monthold bid to create a market economy from 
the shattered socialist system 
but the prime minister said there would be no return to the huge 
government subsidies for unprofitable and inefficient staterun 
industries including the railroads

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in a 
hastily scheduled television address sunday appealed to countrymen 
to stay calm about plans to double food prices under a shift to a 
regulated market economy 
dont panic comrades gorbachev said hoping to stem a run 
on stores prompted by the new economic reform package announced 
thursday by premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
he acknowledged that an anxious mood has arisen in the 
country over the economic plan 
the soviet president spoke for 45 minutes from a prepared text 
he is scheduled to leave tuesday for a summit meeting in washington 
with president bush 
in addition to touching off panic buying the reforms have also 
drawn criticism from such radicals as boris n yeltsin who advocate 
a much swifter transition to a market economy 
yeltsin is running on a radical reform platform for president of 
the russian federation the largest of the 15 soviet republics he 
failed to gain a majority in the first two rounds of balloting in 
the russian congress last week but said he will compete in the 
third round scheduled for monday 
in his speech gorbachev said that under the new reforms lower 
income people would be compensated for the price increases and 
those who lose their jobs would be retrained for new work 
some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people 
could lose their jobs as a result of the reforms expected to drive 
many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy 
but gorbachev said this transition to a market economy 
cannot be postponed because negative consequences will develop 
what we need now is social accord 
he did not mention a plan for holding a public referendum on the 
radical fiveyear reform that was discussed by ryzhkovs deputies 
yuri maslyukov and leonid abalkin on wednesday 
under ryzhkovs reforms bread prices would triple to about 
109 a loaf on july 1 and other food prices would double on 
average on jan 1 
the average soviet monthy salary is 279 ryzhkov said thursday 
that bread makes up 20 percent of the average soviet diet 
under the threephase reform plan which carries through 1995 
60 percent of state enterprises would be sold to the public sector 
and controls would be lifted on 60 percent of prices 
other prices would remain under state control and many 
industries would stay in state hands over the opposition of 
radical reformers 
gorbachev said the current price of bread does not at all 
correspond to the amount of labor in its production people buy 
bread and feed it to their animals and this at a time when we are 
forced to buy grain abroad 
he said that in the united states and canada which sell grain 
to moscow the price of bread is four times as high as in the 
soviet union where food prices are heavily subsidized 
panic buying continued on sunday in soviet stores shoppers 
jammed gastronom no 1 on gorky street where clerks said sales 
were several times the normal rate 
gorbachev without mentioning names spoke against critics of 
the government reform program they can inflict irreparable 
damage we must put those hecklers in their places they are guided 
only by their ambitions and not the interests of the people 
but criticism has come not only from populists like yeltsin but 
from the mainstream press 
a commentary written by economist yegor gaidar in sundays 
edition of the communist party daily pravda said with each 
passing day it becomes clearer that to try to balance between the 
market and administrative measures is impossible that traditional 
commands are not working and that the center is losing control 
he called for a swifter transition to a market economy 
the government newspaper izvestia ran a commentary written by 
eduard gonzalez calling for a nationwide referendum on the reform 
plan

sunday launched a harsh attack on proapartheid whites saying the 
countrys leading rightwing movement had become irresponsible 
undemocratic and dangerous 
de klerks denunciation of the conservative party came after

klerks plans to dismantle the nations system of racial 
segregation 
the rally in the capital of pretoria was the largest 
proapartheid demonstration since de klerk came to power in august 
and began a series of reforms 
at the rally saturday the leader of the conservatives andries 
treurnicht told his supporters that whites would fight moves to 
bring about a black government 
the socalled new south africa of forced integration which 
the government is forcing on us gives us no other choice but to 
defend our rights treurnicht said 
de klerk rejected that stance sunday 
the conservative partys threats of revolt and resistance are 
irresponsible undemocratic and dangerous to our country de 
klerk was quoted as saying in mondays editions of the nationalist 
the official publication of his ruling national party 
the comments among the strongest he has leveled against the 
right wing to date were made available on sunday night 
de klerk said radicalism by the conservatives could lead to 
broedertwis or a fight between brothers 
the conservatives won 31 percent of the vote in white elections 
last year and are the official opposition in the dominant white 
chamber of parliament the party favors rigid apartheid and says 
blacks should have political rights only in tribal homelands

new constitution that will allow the 5 million whites to share 
power with the 28 million blacks

violence going on

province and the actions of the police who have fired on black 
demonstrators several times in recent weeks resulting in more than 
20 deaths

the preceding 24 hours in a series of new faction fights in natal

a source close to the nations weapons testing 
program on sunday denied claims by antinuclear activists that the 
united states recently conducted a nuclear test 
it would really be foolhardy to conduct a nuclear test this 
close to the bushgorbachev summit the source said of the 
upcoming meeting in washington between the us and soviet leaders 
the source who spoke to the associated press on condition of 
anonymity flatly denied that the united states conducted any 
recent test 
activists attending a worldwide gathering against nuclear 
testing reported that the united states detonated a nuclear weapon 
underground friday at the nevada test site 65 miles northwest of 
las vegas 
the comments came at a conference in alma ata ussr a city 
in the soviet union near the russian nuclear test site of 
semipalatinsk 
antinuclear activists from around the world including the 
united states and soviet union are attending the fourday 
conference 
dr bernard lown an organizer of the conference and president 
of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war said 
he was ashamed and angered at the reports of a nuclear test in 
the united states 
this makes no sense lown said why are we conducting 
nuclear tests just a few days before the summit 
the american source agreed and said it was a mystery as to 
where the antinuclear activists heard of a test 
all us and british tests are conducted at the nevada site 
larger tests are announced in advance and smaller tests are 
revealed after the fact 
in past years some tests have not been announced for security 
reasons 
it is believed in recent years that all tests have been 
announced although the government continues to maintain an 
official policy that some tests may not be announced 
the united states conducts about a dozen tests a year at the 
desert site

arab leaders who want to stop the 
emigration of soviet jews to israel gathered sunday to forge a 
united front on the issue but divisions and rivalries were at work 
even before the emergency summit began 
the 21member arab league was also expected to criticize the 
united states for its support of israel 
in a move certain to draw anger at the arab gathering israel 
said sunday it expected the number of soviet immigrants to increase 
to 20000 per month this summer about 40000 soviet jews have 
arrived so far this year 
the arabs see the new wave of jewish emigration coupled with 
israels rejection of recent peace proposals as a threat they 
fear many soviet jews will settle in the israelioccupied west bank 
and gaza strip which the palestinians proclaimed their homeland in 
1988 
israeli officials deny there are plans to settle the soviet jews 
in the occupied areas and force out the palestinian inhabitants 
in jerusalem prime minister yitzhak shamirs aide avi pazner 
quoted shamir as saying he hoped the summit meeting will not pour 
fuel on to the fire but to the contrary will also contribute to 
improving the atmosphere maybe by agreeing to negotiations with 
israel 
shamir has repeatedly called for arab nations to enter into 
direct talks with israel 
the baghdad summit will underscore old disputes that have 
blocked efforts to forge arab unity 
syrian president hafez assad iraqi president saddam husseins 
archrival in the arab world refused to attend so did four other 
heads of state although some will send highlevel officials in 
their place 
assad miffed that the summit is being held in his rivals 
capital rebuffed intensive arab efforts including a lastminute 
effort by libyas moammar gadhafi to persuade him to end his 
11yearold feud with saddam in the interest of arab unity 
the summit will get under way with us unable to project even a 
semblance of unity said an arab diplomat from the persian gulf 
region speaking on condition of anonymity 
fifteen presidents kings and sheiks of the arab world which 
stretches from the persian gulf to the atlantic jetted into 
baghdad airport sunday to a redcarpet welcome from saddam 
among them were king fahd of saudi arabia king hussein of 
jordan and president hosni mubarak of egypt fahds presence 
particularly was seen as a major boost for the summit 
amid tight security the international airport was closed to 
regular traffic as the leaders arrived saddam greeted each as a 
military band played national anthems and the military fired 21gun 
salutes 
the rift between syria and iraq was not likely to be a key issue 
at the summit 
but one of the main differences will be between those who favor 
getting tough with the united states israels main backer and 
those who seek a more moderate line 
iraq and the palestine liberation organization which is an arab 
league member want to take a tough line 
the moderates are led by egypt and oilrich saudi arabia 
a 16page memorandum from washington delivered to arab foreign 
ministers who met in baghdad last week to pave the way for the 
summit touched off an uproar by urging the arabs to avoid 
rhetoric focus on direct arabisraeli negotiations and avoid 
outright denunications of soviet jewish emigration 
the memorandum also accused iraq which boasts it has developed 
binary chemical weapons and longrange missiles capable of hitting 
israeli cities of violating international conventions banning use 
of chemical and biological weapons 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz angrily dismissed the american 
document as inaccurate and insensitive 
plo leader yasser arafat an ally of saddam called last month 
for the summit to discuss ways to blunt soviet jewish emigration to 
israel and revive the stalled peace process 
the summit follows a new wave of violence in the 
israelioccupied territories touched off by the may 20 slaying of 
seven unarmed palestinian laborers near tel aviv by a former 
israeli soldier israeli authorities said the gunman was deranged 
saddam and the plo insisted the summit convene ahead of the may 
31 meeting between president bush and soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev with the apparent intention of focussing the 
superpowers attention on their problems 
lebanese president elias hrawi has said that like assad he 
will not attend the summit twothirds of his warravaged country 
is under syrian military control 
conference sources said president chadli bendjedid of algeria 
will not attend in sympathy with syria and king hassan of morocco 
also will not participate conference sources said he hates flying 
but those leaders will send highlevel delegations 
sultan qaboos of oman also announced that he will send an envoy 
to represent him

beyond that there are debates about the rules about which team 
really is the fastest and about why st ubaldo is celebrated every 
may 
symbolically whenever we have the race its always baldo 
first said ron tomko of the society of st anthony 
this northeastern pennsylvania town of 5000 people was settled 
by natives of gubbio italy which claims ubaldo as its patron 
saint in most years since 1911 teams from the societies of saints 
george and anthony challenged members of st ubaldo to a race of 
the saints with each team carrying an 800pound statue of their 
saint atop a platform through the 1mile course 
to honor him st ubaldo always goes first and the rules make it 
easy for him to stay out front each team starts 63 feet apart and 
there is no passing 
the truth according to tomko is that st anthony would be the 
best in an unrigged race but across town another group claims 
superiority 
st george has always had the strongest team in the race at 
least for the last 10 years said mario mariani a captain of the 
st georges team if you watch the race youll see the distance 
st anthony is behind 
the only team not claiming to be the fastest during saturdays 
race was st ubaldos which was shorthanded and had to stray from 
the rules and borrow men from the other teams to help carry its 
statue 
the race is similar to one held the last 799 years in gubbio on 
may 15 the eve of the real st ubaldos day with teams carrying 
1200pound statues over a longer steeper course 
the feast is celebrated in jessup every memorial day weekend 
ending at the jessup memorial stadium in an added twist each team 
dismantles its platform and races its statue up a hillside 
in this second race its anybodys ball game not just 
ubaldos st anthonys won the second race saturday 
there are several theories on why st ubaldo is honored most 
say ubaldo rescued gubbio by negotiating with a barbarian who was 
ravaging the italian countryside or that ubaldo was a 
philanthropist who spread his wealth among townspeople while 
accepting a life of poverty for himself

the captain and two crew members of a panamanian 
ship which exploded in the houston ship channel may have caused the

was moored for repairs at newpark shipyard the 25 crewmen aboard 
when the seta exploded jumped into the ship channel 
federal authorities think residue from chemicals illegally 
dumped into the ship channel may have been ignited by a spark from 
a welding torch on an adjacent vessel in dry dock and the fire 
spread to the tanker said coast guard lt mary landry 
cargo tanks had residue from recent hazardous cargoes of 
acetone toluene caustic soda mineral spirits xylene hexane and 
kerosene

a man scheduled to be the first 
arkansas death row inmate executed in more than a quarter century 
is suing the state over his right to worship the devil 
but officials see the suit as just another ploy by john edward 
swindler to stay alive 
swindler is to be put to death june 18 for the 1976 shooting 
death of a fort smith police officer because he was sentenced 
before the state switched its method of executions swindler has 
the choice of dying in the electric chair or by lethal injection 
the state standard 
no arkansas prisoner has been put to death since 1964 earlier 
this month the us supreme court refused to consider swindlers 
appeal a district court judge then granted the states motion to 
withdraw a 9yearold stay of execution in the case 
swindler who has sued the prison system numerous times over 
alleged mistreatment on death row has joined another inmates 
lawsuit against prison officials for being prohibited from reading 
the satanic bible 
prison officials contend swindler is trying use the lawsuit as 
another roadblock to his execution 
hell attack the system in any way he can prison spokesman 
david white said recently i dont think he shows any strong 
religious inclinations 
but swindler who is at the states maximumsecurity unit in 
tucker in southeastern arkansas adamantly lays claims to his 
religious roots 
i am a satanist he wrote in a letter to a reporter last 
summer he said he and fellow inmate john e campbell will let 
the prison administrators know we are true satanists and want the 
right to practice my faith and worship my lord lucifer 
to me it shows their lack of their faith in their god of 
christianity when they refuse my religion swindler wrote 
court records show that in his last hearing in federal court 
swindler told jurors he was a quaker 
campbell who is serving a life sentence at the maximumsecurity 
unit for aggravated robbery and attempted murder filed the 
original lawsuit in december 1988 and swindler intervened later 
named as defendants are prison director al art lockhart 
warden larry norris and prison chaplain dennis pigman 
campbell is seeking permission to read the satanic bible and to 
wear a mailorder medallion in addition to 330000 in damages 
swindler also wants to read the satanic bible and asks that the 
prison create satanic religious services 
federal law authorizes prison wardens to censor prisoners 
reading materials if the materials are deemed disruptive 
white said he could not comment on pending litigation but 
acknowledged that the warden had prohibited the prisoners from 
reading the satanic bible 
swindler is on death row for the murder of fort smith police 
officer randy basnett he also was convicted of murdering two south 
carolina teenagers and is suspected in the death of a young 
hitchhiker in florida

militants opened fire on a group of soldiers returning from a 
patrol 
however a spokesman for an armenian group said the soldiers had 
started the clash by opening fire he said 15 people were killed 
the attack was the latest violence in the tense caucasus 
republic but the first time the clashes spread to a public place 
in yerevan 
ten interior ministry soldiers were wounded in the shooting 
three critically and one civilian bystander was hospitalized with 
bullet wounds tass said 
the soldiers were attacked by about 15 armed men when they 
returned from escorting a passenger train to kafan 120 miles 
southeast of yerevan tass said 
the southeastern corner of armenia near kafan has become one of 
the tensest areas in the dispute between armenians and azerbaijanis 
over control of the nagornokarabakh region 
the personnel exercising their right to repulse an attack 
returned fire tass said five militants were killed and two 
were injured in the shootout one of the injured soon died 
tass provided no other details officials of the interior 
ministry in yerevan said they were not authorized to release

unrest continued throughout the day in yerevan as crowds of up 
to 50000 people roamed the streets after the shooting incident 
according to a duty officer at the armenian national movement in 
yerevan who was contacted by telephone 
the spokesman who declined to give his name blamed soldiers 
for starting the incident by firing on a group of armenians 
the armenian spokesman put the death toll at 15 including one 
young woman it was impossible to determine which version of events 
was correct 
armenia has been locked in a bitter dispute for more than two 
years with azerbaijan over control of nagornokarabakh that region 
is predominantly ethnic armenian but legally belongs to azerbaijan 
several hundred people have been killed and hundreds of 
thousands have been forced to flee their homes in more than two 
years of ethnic attacks and clashes between civilians and soldiers 
soviet soldiers are stationed in both republics to quell 
violence but militants on both sides see the troops as an 
occupying force

at military checkpoints and on a patrol in nagornokarabakh 
killing one serviceman and wounding four tass said soldiers killed 
one attacker and wounded six

poles voted sunday for community councils 
nationwide and were expected to push forward the countrys 
democratic revolution by ousting communists from their last 
bastions of power 
the vote was the first fully free ballot since world war ii and 
aims to reinstitute local governments that are entirely autonomous 
of warsaw that system was not allowed under four decades of 
communist party rule 
unofficial results of the 52000 individual races were expected 
on monday but official results were not expected until wednesday 
solidarity citizens committees are expected to dominate local 
governments but the vote will be a test of the countrys budding 
independent political parties 
the vast majority of society although angry at the bad 
economic situation understands that we must stick together 
because there is no other choice solidarity chairman lech walesa 
said after voting near gdansk we must take over power from the 
bottom and build the foundations of democracy 
voting in warsaw prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki said the 
balloting was fundamental local government elections will not 
change the economic situation but we can say they are changing the 
system 
senate speaker andrzej stelmachowski said the vote finally 
will anchor democracy to the very bottom to the grassroots 
after this our changes will be truly irreversible 
in previous local elections held under the communists only 
those candidates approved by partydominated nominating boards were 
allowed to run the local councils considered the agents of the 
central government depended on warsaw for money and their 
decisions could be overturned 
the election of local officials answerable to residents and not 
to warsaw should make administration of towns and villages more 
efficient mazowiecki said 
more than 146000 candidates from about 80 parties were vying 
nationwide official posters outside polling places listed the 
names of district candidates and the parties they represented 
finally we have real elections and i went to all those 
elections before so i know the difference said jozef szewicz a 
doctor leaving a polling station with his wife 
thank god that i lived to see this said janina krakowska 
who worked on a farm in the town of wiskitki until she retired 
there was little of the enthusiasm displayed during last junes 
partly free parliamentary elections when solidarity plastered 
towns with posters and manned stands outside polling places 
politicking was illegal sunday 
the final turnout was 42 percent nationwide according to the 
general election commission in junes parliamentary elections the 
turnout was 62 percent 
there were fewer preparations fewer posters because we didnt 
want people to say we were wasting money said maria simiatowska 
of the solidarity citizens committee in skierniewice a provincial 
capital 30 miles southwest of warsaw 
the june parliamentary vote was governed by an agreement between 
solidarity and the former communist government the accord reserved 
65 percent of the seats in the lower house of parliament the sejm 
for the communists and their allies and 35 percent for nonparty 
independents 
in that vote solidarity candidates won all nonparty seats by 
wide margins in august solidarity took over a coalition 
government the first noncommunist leadership in the east bloc 
since then an entirely new system of local government has been 
drafted and approved by parliament local governments will be given 
onefifth of the central governments vast property and will be 
empowered to raise and spend revenues independently of warsaw 
mazowiecki and walesa have both called for parliamentary 
elections next spring in which no seats would be set aside for any 
political party

president bush in an interview 
broadcast sunday in the soviet union said weve got big 
differences with mikhail s gorbachev over german unity and 
lithuania that could impede this weeks superpower summit 
while hailing gorbachev as a statesman bush said he may be 
mad with me over some things because we do have some differences 
bush said he would not try to exploit any weakness suffered by 
gorbachev because of economic problems and ethnic unrest in the 
soviet union 
i think that when you sit down with a respected world leader 
its not a question of who is stronger who is weaker who has got 
bigger problems who has got less problems the president said 
he promised to treat the soviet people and their leader with 
the respect that they deserve 
bush said that if we argue well do that pleasantly hes a 
tough guy listen ive been around him enough to know that he 
drives his point home 
well i can do the same thing bush said and i think its 
important that i level with him heres whats in my heart heres 
our policy 
gorbachev went on television sunday night to appeal for calm 
amid panic in the soviet union over imminent food price hikes 
bush as he finished a round of golf sunday was asked about 
gorbachevs appeal its a big problem said bush 
bush and gorbachev will meet at the white house beginning 
thursday on friday they are to sign an agreement to destroy 
chemical weapons and outline limits on cruise missiles which have 
been an obstacle to agreement on a strategic nuclear weapons pact 
the two leaders will go to the presidential retreat at camp 
david md on saturday for more talks and then conduct a wrapup 
news conference sunday at the white house 
in a round of presummit jockeying bush administration leaders 
and a soviet official made appearances sunday on television talk 
shows 
bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft said it would 
be impossible for the superpowers to sign an agreement banning 
longrange missiles although the two sides are making progress on 
negotiations 
but scowcroft said arms control will not be the focus of the 
summit 
the fundamental issues are talking about remaking the 
political map of europe and also secondarily what is going on it 
the soviet union scowcroft said on abctvs this week with 
david brinkley 
scowcroft was also adamant that the united states would not 
grant trade benefits known as most favored nation status to the 
soviet union until the moscow passes immigration laws that allow 
citizens to leave the country freely 
bush who arrived here friday for a fourday presummit 
vacation was interviewed thursday at the white house by soviet tv 
correspondent valentin zorin for a sunday night broadcast in the 
soviet union a text of bushs remarks was released here 
bush spoke repeatedly of obstacles in ussoviet relations 
particularly coercion of lithuania and german unity and so weve 
got big differences on some of these questions 
weve got some problems in the baltic states that inhibit 
total openness here the president said 
weve got some problems in what we think reforms need to be 
taking place before we can have the full exchange of economic 
interests there 
gorbachev in an interview published in this weeks issue of 
time magazine said the german unity question was certain to 
produce a major disagreement with bush 
but gorbachev said i do expect the differences to be 
narrowed 
bush said he would try to convince gorbachev there would be no 
threat to the soviet union from having a united germany in the 
usled nato alliance however soviet and american officials held 
out little hope that gorbachev could be persuaded 
i didnt say we could secretary of state james a baker iii 
said on cbstvs face the nation program i said we will have 
to try because the position we have is very firmly held and were 
not going to come off of that position 
soviet politburo member aleksandr yakovlev reflecting moscows 
fears of a militarily strong germany said we shall do 
everything in our power to guarantee to the soviet union to the 
soviet people that no war will ever start from the german soil 
that there will be no threat to our people 
that is our principal concern and we turn to the west we 
appeal to the west to take this point of view of the soviet union 
into account said yakovlev an adviser to gorbachev he was 
interviewed on nbctvs meet the press 
bush said i want to convince mr gorbachev with whom i can 
talk freely hes the kind of man you can very frankly with that 
a us presence in europe a unified germany a germany in nato not 
only is no threat to the soviet union but preserves the kind of 
stable europe that the soviets should welcome 
he called soviet pressure against the breakaway republic of 
lithuania an issue that is troubling that i dont want to sweep 
under this rug 
and i have to have him understand the constraints on any us 
president until selfdetermination is visible and forthcoming 
there

visiting a spiritual medium who then spent a week trying to revive 
him authorities said 
horn kim chhim 50 suffered from a stomach ailment but did not 
believe in doctors authorities said saturday his body was to 
undergo an autopsy monday or tuesday 
authorities said it was unlikely the medium would be charged 
with any crime 
there was strange activity but nothing criminal said los 
angeles county sheriffs sgt scott coleman the medium was not 
identified and his beliefs and practices were not described 
he said relatives told sheriffs investigators that chhim was 
suffering from a stomach ailment when he was taken to the mediums 
home on may 18 for religious reasons 
although authorities were uncertain of the date of chhims 
death it appeared that he was with the medium when he died 
officials said the medium then asked the family to allow him to 
keep the corpse in an attempt to restore the dead mans spirit 
apparently the medium told the family he could bring the body 
back to life and after they gave it to him for a week and the body 
didnt come back to life he gave it back coleman said 
on friday family members called paramedics to the dead mans 
home in this city just east of los angeles

a controversial tour boat capsized 
sunday in rapids a few hundred yards below niagara falls throwing 
seven people into the cold waters of the niagara river 
no one aboard the 23foot jet boat was seriously hurt according 
to niagara parks police constable steve kelly two people 
including a yugoslavian tourist were treated at greater niagara 
general hospital for hypothermia and released a nursing supervisor 
said 
three passengers on the jet boat international tour swam to 
safety on the us side of the river below the bridge connecting 
queenston and lewiston ny 
we hit the rapids and we then came back again to have 
another go at it and thats when we went over passenger john 
swan said 
the company started its niagara river tours two weeks ago 
despite warnings from us and canadian authorities it would not be 
safe 
swan president of a winery in nearby niagaraonthelake said 
he didnt know what caused the accident 
all of a sudden i was under the boat he said i gradually 
made my way to the shore 
canadian and us rescue teams and a tourist helicopter company 
helped rescue the seven people 
jet boat international owner jim mclean declined to comment on 
the accident 
when jet boat international started its excursions for 
thrillseekers a senior marine surveyor for the canadian coast 
guard said he was skeptical about whether the waters were safe 
enough to navigate 
canadian and american law prohibit anyone from launching boats 
into the niagara river from public lands but the company got 
around the regulation by launching its craft from a private yacht 
club 
the company is the first to operate tours on the river since 
three people were killed in 1975

a family of six is trying hard to regard a 
possible social call from raisa gorbachev as something like a visit 
from a dear aunt 
but the watsons acknowledge theyre thinking a lot about what 
theyll wear whether theyll offer mrs gorbachev something to eat 
and what theyll chat about with reporters and security officials 
nearby 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and his wife said they 
would like to visit a home during their sixhour stay in the twin 
cities area next sunday 
the home of steve and karen watson and their four children was 
recommended partly because their 13yearold daughter lisa 
performed in moscow last year in an exchange between the childrens 
theater co of minneapolis and a moscow childrens theater 
the gorbachevs itinerary has not been released but the watsons 
must prepare as if they were certain theyll be entertaining one or 
both 
karen watson 38 said a public relations expert gave them some 
advice 
she told us to view it as a dear aunt coming to visit and keep 
it simple mrs watson said still the watsons cant shake the 
surreal quality of it all 
it feels very strange that we should be given some of their 
time mrs watson said we feel very honored and very lucky 
jon cranney artistic director of the childrens theater co 
recommended the watsons to members of gov rudy perpichs staff 
who were looking for a typical middleclass home gorbachev could 
visit 
steve watson 39 teaches art at forest hills elementary school 
in eden prairie 
lisa also appeared in abctvs miniseries filmed in the twin 
cities the voices within the lives of truddi chase which 
aired may 2021 she portrayed a daughter of the title character 
played by shelley long

two democratic candidates for governor 
took to the pulpit in black churches at opposite ends of california 
on sunday as each battled for grassroots support 
state attorney general john van de kamp unveiled a 7 
billionplus plan in sacramento to build a world class 
passenger rail system in california by the end of the decade in 
los angeles former san francisco mayor dianne feinstein stuck to 
general themes in getoutthevote speeches 
van de kamps rail plan calls for passage of both propositions 
108 and 116 bond issues on the june 5 ballot that would raise 
299 billion thats enough van de kamp says to begin a project 
to link californias major cities with faster more convenient 
passenger trains 
it is time for this state to catch up to the rest of the world 
in rapid transit van de kamp said 
van de kamp who took his campaign entourage on a 3hour train 
trip from sacramento to fresno said the same distance could be 
covered by one of frances highspeed trains in about 80 minutes 
ms feinstein challenged herself and other politicians to be 
like black south african leader nelson mandela who newly released 
from prison must chart a course for the future a course that 
says you cant deny equal opportunity a course that says there 
has to be a level playing field if people are going to succeed in 
this world 
she refused to elaborate on her pledge saturday to make half the 
appointments in her administration women and to hire minorities by 
a quota system in proportion to their population california is 
projected to be mostly nonwhite in 10 years 
i see bringing people of color into a position of power in 
government was all she would tell reporters sunday 
as the campaign for the democratic nomination in the june 5 
primary entered its final 10 days van de kamp and ms feinstein 
are returning to traditional campaigning with visits to churches 
the two had concentrated earlier on raising funds for television 
advertisements 
van de kamp delivered brief campaign speeches to two black 
baptist congregations in sacramento and a third in nearby north 
highlands stressing a message of politics as public service 
im running because i think its time we start to love one 
another again im running to serve others he told the 
congregation at the antioch baptist church 
id like it to be said of me someday that i tried to feed the 
hungry not only tried but succeeded he continued before the 
congregation of st pauls baptist church 
relaxed and gaining confidence at every stop ms feinstein told 
four congregations in the largely poor watts and southcentral 
sections of los angeles that her administration would bring better 
education and more opportunity for their children 
she warmed to the rousing music and singing at the first african 
methodist episcopal church near downtown that featured a choir of 
children and teenage gospel singers 
as we were sitting here getting a little soul i was looking 
into a number of faces and wondering if in 10 years from today will 
we have a better state will we have a safer community she said 
will these young people eyes bright standing tall really be 
able to take their full place in a society that promises the 
american dream 
the democratic contest has been marked by sharp shifts in public 
opinion 
feinstein was well ahead of van de kamp in early polls but the 
next round of surveys showed her lagging behind in a doubledigit 
deficit 
next after she launched a media blitz another poll moved her 
from 18 percentage points behind van de kamp to 19 points ahead 
that lead soon evaporated however and a los angeles times poll 
released earlier this month had her with a 13point lead 37 
percent to 24 percent over van de kamp the undecided vote was even 
higher at 38 percent 
on the republican side lowprofile candidate pete wilson has no 
major opposition and is steadily raising money for the november 
general election

the supreme court on sunday rejected an appeal 
by former nuclear technician mordechai vanunu who was convicted of 
treason and spying for leaking details of israels nuclear weapons 
program to a british newspaper 
the announcement by the threejudge panel was read behind closed 
doors in keeping with the secrecy surrounding the case since 
vanunu was arrested in 1986 after disappearing in london 
the judges did not make public their reasons for rejecting the 
appeal and banned publication of their 89page verdict they gave 
vanunus attorney avigdor feldman 30 days to appeal the decision 
feldman told reporters he plans to ask for a larger panel of 
justices to rule on whether a man can be accused of treason for 
ties with a newspaper 
vanunu captured wideworld attention when the sunday times of 
london on oct 5 1986 printed information and photographs he 
provided 
the information detailed operations of an israeli nuclear 
reactor near the town of dimona in the negev desert and suggested 
that israel had stockpiled at least 100 nuclear weapons and had the 
capability to produce neutron and hydrogen bombs 
israel has never responded directly to those allegations and 
officials would only say that israel will not be the first to 
introduce atomic weapons into the middle east 
vanunu was convicted of treason and espionage in december 1988 
and sentenced to 18 years in prison 
during his trial vanunu testified he made his revelations to 
the newspaper to alert the world to the dangers of nuclear weapons 
not for personal gain or out of a desire to harm his country 
vanunu is being held in solitary confinement

labor experts estimate that 5000 to 10000 
children many of them working grueling hours in hazardous 
conditions are illegally employed in the citys garment industry 
every day the daily news reported sunday 
the trend has reached a level not seen since the turn of the 
century when there were no child labor laws the news said it 
comes as apparel manufacturers struggle to compete with their 
rivals in asia where labor costs are lower 
ninetynine percent of the minors are documented or undocumented 
aliens from mexico latin america and asia they often are paid off 
the books well below the minimum wage of 380 an hour 
the situation is out of control and beyond the reach of 
regulation said stanley aronowitz a labor expert at city 
university 
in the first three months of this year the state labor 
departments apparel industry task force found 90 garment district 
factories illegally employing 128 minors it was the largest number 
of violators nabbed in any threemonth period by the task force 
which was created in 1987 
the number of children documented as illegally employed in the 
city soared more than 900 percent from 90 to 819 between 1983 and 
1989 according to the state labor department 
but task force officials said tracking down violators is an 
arduous often frustrating job there are 3500 registered garment 
manufacturers in the city and an equal number that are unregistered 
and illegal the task force has 24 investigators 
the newspaper described how three children illegal aliens from 
mexico worked 11 hours in a room filled with electrical hazards 
solvent fumes poor ventilation and fire hazards 
the news said some teenage alien workers seen during a task 
force sweep of eight garment operations last week appeared strained 
by the monotonous work and dilapidated surroundings but others 
appeared content and conscientious for them even those conditions 
were better than no work 
there also are widespread child labor law violations at 
restaurants supermarkets and laundries said richard polsinello 
director of labor standards for the state labor department

about 250 mohawks 
staged a peaceful protest sunday against the continued presence of 
police on this reservation 
basically you still have martial law even though they are 
allowing outside traffic to go through said harold oakes a 
spokesman for the protesters 
the demonstration took place on the us side of the 28000acre 
reservation which covers parts of new york and the canadian 
provinces of ontario and quebec 
us and canadian police moved onto the reservation may 1 after 
two mohawk men were shot dead in a feud between pro and 
antigambling factions 
new york state troopers allowed outside traffic onto the reserve 
late last week for the first time since march however they 
continue to stop and search vehicles within the reserve and 
ontario and quebec provincial police continue to patrol canadian 
sections of the reservation 
oakes said the situation is bad for businesses along route 37 
the reservations main thoroughfare the route which bisects 
indian land is dotted with gas stations and restaurants as well 
as the controversial casinos which remain closed 
were still not sure whether the presence of armed police is 
going to have a negative effect on traffic through here oakes 
said they might not stop here 
the demonstrators also were protesting the release wednesday of 
doug george on 15000 bail george the antigambling editor of 
the reservations two newspapers has been charged with 
seconddegree murder in the may 1 shooting near snye quebec of 
harold edwards 33 who was neutral in the gambling dispute 
quebec police are still investigating the may 1 shooting death 
of 22yearold matthew pyke who opposed gambling 
following sundays protest the crowd gathered at a bingo hall 
for what turned out to be a rally for norman tarbell who is 
running against harold tarbell in the june 2 election for the head 
chief of the tribal council that governs the us side of the 
reserve the two are not related 
harold tarbell is the only one of the three chiefs on the 
council who opposes gambling and oakes said his defeat would help 
solve the crisis 
we believe they will start listening to the will of the people 
instead of letting things linger and fester he said 
the gambling feud has been simmering since late last july when 
the fbi and new york state police raided the casinos and 
confiscated scores of slot machines 
mohawk traditionalists claim that gambling goes against the 
mohawk way of life gambling supporters say the casinos bring 
needed revenue and jobs to the reservation

the president of the childrens defense 
fund urged yale university seniors sunday to build a more just 
society and told them to remember even small efforts count 
enough fleas biting strategically can make even the biggest 
dog uncomfortable said marian wright edelman 
edelman the first woman chosen by yale seniors to be their 
class day speaker told the students they will be graduating monday 
into an ethically polluted nation where the standard for 
success is too often personal greed rather than public good 
i hope america redefines what success means in the 1990s 
she said 
she gave the seniors the same stern advice she said she is 
passing on to her three children 
never just work for money she said dont confuse wealth 
and fame for character never confuse morality with legality dont 
condone corruption dont do just as little as you can to get by 
eldeman is a 1963 graduate of yale law school and founder of the 
washingtonbased childrens defense fund an advocacy group for 
childrens rights 
class day at yale is filled with traditions as has been the 
custom since the 1860s each member of the graduating class was

given a white handkerchief to wave at the conclusion of the singing 
of bright college years which ends with the line for god 
for country and for yale

touring the ancient shrines of this 
mediterranean crossroads pope john paul ii said sunday that 
christianity must play a central role in the new europe emerging 
after the collapse of communist rule 
the concept of a united europe based on recognition of christian 
roots has been a major theme of the pope in recent months and he 
raised it again on this island he called a marvelous symbiosis of 
european and mediterranean culture 
as evidence of maltas historic position as a crossroads of 
civilizations he pointed to its playing host to the ussoviet 
superpower summit in december 
john paul who returned to rome on sunday night at the end of 
his threeday visit to malta said recent changes in europe show 
the inadequacy and failure of a culture which was not built on 
the primacy of the spiritual dimension of the human person 
the present challenge facing europe is to rediscover its own 
deepest roots in accepting this challenge european culture is 
forcefully called to account for the christian faith that gave form 
to its peoples the pope told a group of professors writers and 
other cultural figures on malta 
the vatican says 99 percent of maltas 350000 people are roman 
catholics and john paul has repeatedly stressed that church values 
were the islands most precious inheritance 
maltese marked the first visit ever by a pope as a giant 
holiday setting off fireworks and booming cannon salutes wherever 
john paul visited 
on sunday john paul prayed at st pauls grotto where maltese 
say the apostle was shipwrecked in the year 60 and founded the 
first christian community 
the polishborn popes enthusiasm for the changes in eastern 
europe has been tempered by wariness for what he calls a narrow 
sense of spiritual inspiration among peoples 
men and women of culture that you are you know that the 
restoration of external freedoms is only the first stage the first 
step he said sunday the exercise of freedom must be 
accompanied by a growth in moral and spiritual maturity 
addressing youths in a soccer stadium on sunday john paul 
called for reconciliation in maltese society an apparent reference 
to bitter quarrels between supporters of the islands two political 
parties 
a papal visit to malta would have been considered unthinkable 
under the previous socialist administration which had sought to 
reduce the churchs dominant role 
the malta trip was the 48th foreign tour of john pauls papacy 
his next scheduled trip is to africa in september

the advance word about pioneer was 
that the play was full of profanity and that it attacked the images 
of famed explorers suggesting base motives rather than heroism 
but pioneer which premiered saturday at the spoleto 
festival is more amiable than that and surprisingly for an 
avantgarde play with music and performance art its easy to 
follow 
pioneer was brought to the regional arts festival by the 
paul dresher ensemble based in san francisco 
at the second of four performances sunday afternoon perhaps the 
worst that could be said is that it would have more impact if it 
lasted an hour instead of an hour and a half 
pioneer is rather fun with pulleys enabling lots of stage 
effects such as the stacking of five sofas so an actor could scale 
them like a mountain 
the story is mostly about junior son of a minor explorer lost 
five miles into the forzen north junior dies and has his body 
frozen rinde eckert gets one of the arias dotted through the 
music singing 100 years from now ill still be 52 
jo harvey allen his widow has the most talking wearing a 
short black slip she has the first of the few speeches vulgarity 
when she describes the kind of man junior expected her to take home 
before he was even cold 
junior was a history buff and we get cortes explains religion 
to the natives with john duykers singing in spanish and 
explaining that the pope is boss and the natives must do 
everything he says 
theres also an amusing scene in which adm robert peary is 
mostly concerned with how he will look in pictures of his travels 
neither he nor the photographer has brought a flag to the north 
pole 
thats about it for debunking explorers 
the widow has a hard time too depressed to get out of bed 
finally she picks up duykers who has several arias and plays 
several characters he tears up the floorboards of her house 
looking for whatever treasure junior hid and leaving the worst 
mess weve ever seen at a final curtain 
pioneer has a happy ending with the widow getting in a car 
and driving off to resume living 
the spoleto festival usa began friday night with a concert 
celebrating the festivals survival of last falls hurricane hugo 
the gaillard auditorium site of the concert and garden theater 
which houses pioneer were the most badly damaged of the 
festivals 11 performance sites both have been refurbished 
leonard bernstein was ill and canceled his engagement to conduct 
the opening concert 
the highlight of the performances arranged to take his place was 
midori the 18yearold violinist with her came julius rudel 
whod conducted her in the bruch scottish fantasy before 
mezzosoprano tatiana troyanos more dramatic in concert than 
opera also arrived on short notice

9000 people attending the ceremony 
the parents also look so happy he said this is the last 
payment that theyll have to make on their children 
hope 86 and his wife dolores were presented with honorary 
doctor of humane letters degrees amidst wild cheers and applause 
before receiving their degrees the hopes were lauded by 
university officials for their humanitarian and philanthropic 
endeavors 
hope then took center stage the audience roared and tittered at 
his trademark oneliners 
im now a doctor at last i can get on the golf course on 
wednesdays he said 
hopes acceptance speech took on a serious tone as he told the 
more than 700 students receiving degrees that their real 
education is about to begin 
youve gotten the last grades youll ever get in geometry 
history and english lit hope said from now on youll be 
attending a far bigger and more important classroom where your 
grades will determine how far you will go in devotion compassion 
and selfrespect that will be the important curriculum from now on 
cicero said a room without books is like a body without a 
soul hope said 
ill never forget when he told me that the comedian added 
dolores hope who was celebrating her 81st birthday sunday also 
drew chuckles from the crowd 
she thanked the university for honoring her and for having bob 
hope as an opening act

seven members of a hong kong theater troupe have 
been denied visas to enter the united states to stage a production 
marking the tiananmen square massacre 
the seven are stranded in england where they recently completed 
five performances according to eleanor yung executive director of 
the asian american art center which is sponsoring the new york 
performance 
the piece called deep structure was scheduled for june 2 
at the borough of manhattan community college in manhattan 
a prodemocracy movement in the peoples republic of china was 
crushed last june 4 when hundreds of demonstrators were killed in 
beijings tiananmen square by government troops 
four actors from the zuni icosohedron troupe were granted visas 
and have been in new york since thursday 
the rest were denied visas by the us embassy in england 
the reason they are giving for the denial is they are afraid 
all the members would not return to hong kong and would stay in 
united states said ms yung 
all 11 performers were given clearance about a month ago by the 
immigration and naturalization service to work temporarily in the 
united states yung said yung had also arranged radio and 
television interviews for the performers as well as some 
sightseeing and had scheduled them to leave june 21 
my feeling is its a very sensitive issue with the tiananmen 
square memorial she said 
she noted that president bush last week extended chinas 
mostfavored nation trading status over the objections of critics 
who said china should be punished for suppressing human rights 
yung said bush seems to be very cautious in terms of how to 
deal with this democracy issue for us to have a memorial 
performance commemorating tiananmen is contrary to their agenda 
a spokeswoman for the us department of state anita stockman 
referred all questions about the visa denial to the us embassy in 
london officials there could not immediately be reached for 
comment 
the theater company whose name refers to an american indian 
tribe and a 25sided geometric shape was founded in 1982 in hong 
kong where they performed deep structure earlier this year

canadian prime minister brian mulroney ended a 
series of inconclusive talks sunday aimed at persuading provincial 
premiers to accept an accord recognizing frenchspeaking quebec as 
a distinct society 
the refusal of three provinces to support the agreement has 
thrown the federal government into a crisis and provoked new fears 
of succession efforts by quebec 
emerging from one of the meetings newfoundland premier clyde 
wells said the differences are substantial and serious and 
resolution will not be easy 
mulroney commented obviously we have serious problems 
mulroney is hoping to salvage what is known as the meech lake 
agreement before its june 23 deadline 
quebec refused to sign canadas 1982 constitution to win its 
support mulroney and all 10 premiers signed a fivepoint amendment 
at meech lake near ottawa in 1987 and set a threeyear deadline 
for ratification by the provincial legislatures 
but the governments changed in three provinces newfoundland 
manitoba and new brunswick and the new premiers have refused to 
back the amendment 
the meech lake accord would define quebec as a distinct 
society from the rest of canada as a way to protect its french 
language and culture

keystone camera corp has charged that 
industry giant eastman kodak co has abandoned the us camera 
industry by relying on imports of foreignmade cameras 
keystone is seeking higher tariffs on all imports of handheld 
35mm cameras except single lens reflex models and on fixedfocus 
handheld 110 cameras kodak opposes to the proposed hike in 
tariffs 
we have not of course abandoned the us camera market we 
are still a domestic producer of cameras said paul allen a 
spokesman at kodaks rochester ny headquarters 
allen said keystones accusations were flawed from a factual 
viewpoint he said kodak would respond in papers to be filed with 
the us international trade commission next week 
in march keystone asked the commission to restrict imports for 
five years saying a flood of imports threatens its competitive 
ability 
keystone describes itself as the sole remaining american 
manufacturer of conventional 35millimeter and 110 cameras and has 
said 500 jobs at its clifton base are at stake if tariffs arent 
raised 
last week kodak said they opposed keystones petition because 
import restrictions would reduce the popularity of photography 
putting at risk thousands of jobs for people who work in all 
elements of the photographic industry 
keystone executive steve ehrlich said friday that kodak is a 
nonplayer in the camera industry their last two efforts show 
that with the disc and the instant ehrlich acknowledged that 
keystone went to kodak in january and offered to manufacture 
domesticallymade cameras to be marketed under the kodak name 
ehrlich said the higher tariffs would lead to higher prices for 
kodak cameras while keystone with 1989 sales of 42 million would 
be able to reduce its prices because it could produce more cameras 
kodak the worlds largest photography company said it had 
sales of 184 billion in 1989

leading us analysts have offered some of their 
most pessimistic assessments yet of mikhail gorbachevs future in 
the wake of an economic reform proposal most experts consider a 
disaster 
gorbachevs destiny is linked to this price reform said 
judy shelton a stanford university economist who has written a 
critical book about the soviet economy 
calling the proposed tripling of basic food prices untenable 
shelton predicted i think the day the bread price hike takes 
effect hell be out 
soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov announced plans last week 
for a public referendum on an economic plan that would raise prices 
of most products by next year including a tripling of bread prices 
by jan 1 
us experts predicted spreading strikes and devastating runs on 
stores and hoarding in anticipation of price hikes 
i would be prepared to say that this moves him one step 
closer to falling from power said harvard university historian 
marshall goldman 
the proposed fiveyear plan is a compromise between the 
decadesold centrally planned economy under which moscow set 
virtually all prices and wages and radical plans for a 
polishstyle shocktherapy to shift to a market economy over 
two years 
soviet lawmakers are divided about the cures for numerous 
economic ills wages are soaring in the double digits while 
industrial production has dropped significantly the country has a 
huge budget deficit shortages are chronic and consumers wait in 
long demoralizing lines to buy the few goods available 
soviet officials describe the proposed new system as a regulated 
market because wage and price controls would be lifted gradually 
and not all state businesses would be sold 
although the plan would allow many soviet enterprises and 
properties to be bought and sold as well as go bankrupt western 
experts said it wasnt radical enough to solve the countrys 
festering problems 
getting halfway there may be worse than never even starting 
said ed hewitt a soviet analyst at the brookings institute a 
washington think tank 
soviet polls have indicated that about half of soviet citizens 
would support a free market system but it was unclear whether they 
would vote for skyrocking prices and unprecedented unemployment 
based on promises of better times by a government that by its own 
admission lacks solid popular support 
hes lost credibility his situation has deteriorated so 
much goldman said in a telephone interview the methods that 
he should have used markets family farming joint ventures 
have gotten off to such a bad start 
hewitt said he was less worried about gorbachevs personal 
position than about his ability to govern after the referendum for 
which no date has been set 
the one mistake that weve made over the last few years is 
that weve underestimated him hewitt said but im sure that 
the economic reform package will not work if they dont pull it 
back and do something more serious theyre going to do more damage 
than from five years of wandering in the wilderness 
shelton said the price hikes were intended to raise money to 
eliminate the soviet budget deficit estimated at anywhere between 
40 billion and 165 billion 
this is not a market plan their prices always have been 
fixed now they will just be fixed at the market rate she said 
shelton said gorbachev was caught between the need to convert 
quickly to a market system and a fear of popular unrest over high 
unemployment and prices that would result he chose a middle route 
of retaining control of higher prices 
hewitt said the referendum decision reflected the governments 
own lack of credibility 
the government and whole leadership are acutely aware they are 
not elected so they decided to have elected policies he said

winstonsalem nc ap a move by two universities to divest 
tobacco stocks shouldnt trigger a barrage of sell orders analysts 
say but it hasnt helped the industrys image 
it is only an egghead institution that would do it john c 
mazwell an analyst at wheat first butcher amp singer in richmond 
va said of the recent divestment decisions by harvard university 
and the city university of new york it makes absolutely no 
sense this is a legal product he said 
still the divestiture could give momentum to the antismoking 
movement and to efforts to restrict tobacco sales in the united 
states analysts say 
on thursday louis w sullivan the secretary of health and 
human services called on state and local governments to curb 
cigarette sales to minors by banning cigarettevending machines 
maxwell said he doubted such a ban would have an impact on the 
tobacco industry because machines account for only about three 
percent of sales 
but calvert crary an analyst with martin simpson amp co said 
the divestitures could change public thinking about the tobacco 
industry 
the companies ability to exist has to do with the publics 
and regulators perception he told the winstonsalem journal 
as long as the public agrees that tobacco is ok thats the 
environment it needs to survive and thrive in 
domestic tobacco sales have been declining gradually crary said 
with a sudden shift in regulator and consumer perception on 
the product and tightened regulatory restrictions you could 
accelerate that trend he said 
harvard began selling its tobacco holdings last year the city 
university of new york announced recently that it would sell all of 
its stock in companies that make tobacco products 
derek bok harvards president wrote in a letter to students 
may 18 that the university divested because of the health risks of 
smoking and the aggressive marketing tactics by the industry to 
sell cigarettes to teenagers 
diana k temple an analyst for salomon bros said i dont 
see a wholesale movement right now away from tobacco 
she said religious and some other groups have refused to invest 
in tobacco for years 
most investors she said were more concerned about the 
potential impact of a batch of lawsuits against tobacco companies 
in recent years that have tried to hold the companies liable for 
smokers who have died of lung cancer 
most institutional investors said emanuel goldman of paine 
webber are more interested in improving the value of investments 
than with the morality of a company 
my point is the objective of money managers is to maximize 
their return and if you leave out the tobacco stock youll be 
limiting yourself he said
