charles h keating jr chairman of american 
continental corp and five other top executives of the 
phoenixbased corporation resigned friday following two legal 
defeats keatings attorney said 
also resigning were corporation president judy j wischer and 
robert j kielty robert m wurzelbacher jr andrew f ligget and 
bradley j boland 
on thursday a federal judge in washington ruled that keating 
and his associates had looted lincoln savings and loan association 
of millions of dollars in federally insured deposits 
the day before a los angeles judge said keating must prove that 
he is out of money and ordered him not to transfer funds out of the 
country 
keating could not be reached to comment on his resignation 
stephen c neal his personal attorney released a short statement 
on his behalf 
while we vigorously disagree with the opinion expressed 
yesterday by judge stanley sporkin of the united states district 
court it has become clear that my client must now concentrate all 
his energy on aggressively defending the legal charges against 
him neal said 
because of that and in light of the fact that these 
individuals are no longer in a position to effectively direct acc 
they have resigned from all of their positions effective 
immediately 
boland keatings soninlaw had been the corporations 
publicrelations chief kielty was senior vice president and 
general counsel ligget was the chief financial officer and 
wurzelbacher had been president of a commercial realestate 
subsidiary 
american continental and 11 subsidiaries filed for 
reorganization under chapter 11 of federal bankrupcty laws on april 
13 1989 and federal regulators took control of lincoln a 58 
billion californiabased sampl which was the corporations primary 
asset 
keating claimed that the federal home loan bank board and its 
successors the resolution trust corporation and the office of 
thrift supervision had waged war with him because of his stands 
against government regulation 
sporkin heard more than 30 days of testimony before ruling 
thursday that keating and the others abused their positions in what 
amounted to a looting of lincoln sporkin also dismissed 
keatings suit to recover lincoln 
regulators have estimated that keatings use of lincolns 
federally insured deposits to finance various junk bond stock and 
real estate ventures and the institutions subsequent collapse 
could cost taxpayers as much as 2 billion 
the government already has spent 12 billion keeping lincoln 
and its more than 20 branches in southern california afloat 
according to lawyers in the case the government also has a 13 
billion civil fraud and racketeering suit pending against keating

student aid climbed during the 1980s to a record 
279 billion but not nearly fast enough to keep pace with college 
costs the college board reported 
aid from all sources grew just 10 percent between 1980 and 1990 
adjusted for inflation the board said in its annual report 
trends in student aid 19801990 
in current dollars total aid increased by 62 percent from the 
1723 billion available in 198081 
but the cost of attending public universities rose by 1053 
percent in current dollars and 40 percent in inflationadjusted 
dollars during the 1980s 
at private universities costs rose 1339 percent in current 
dollars and 595 percent in inflationadjusted dollars the 
boards washington dc office said in the report released 
thursday 
a record 135 million students attended undergraduate and 
graduate programs in the last school year compared with 121 
million in 1980 federal statistics show 
institutional aid grants and loans awarded by colleges and 
universities from their own resources grew by 178 percent during 
the decade from 206 billion to 573 billion after adjusting

state grant programs grew by 123 percent during the decade from 
801 million to 179 billion adjusted for inflation such grants 
were up 52 percent 
offsetting those gains however was an effective decline in 
federal aid

compared with 1995 billion a year earlier a decade ago 1437 
billion was available

the army plans to lower 
the israeli flag and remove a tent encampment near gaza city as 
part of a new policy intended to reduce friction with palestinians 
soldiers have orders not to open fire and to avoid 
confrontations with stonethrowing youths patrols rarely enter the 
villages and crowded refugee camps 
the disengagement reflects a radical shift in the armys 
military doctrine and its effectiveness is reducing bloodshed in 
the palestinian uprising in the occupied territories that began in 
december 1987 
no one has been killed since may in the gaza strip where the 
uprising began in july three palestinians were killed in the west 
bank the lowest monthly toll of the revolt in which israelis have 
killed well over 700 palestinians 
this cant be called turning a blind eye but whoever 
thought of it was brilliant a military commander said on 
condition of anonymity 
he said the policy had been implemented gradually after the 
massacre of seven gaza workers by an israeli gunman may 20 started 
10 days of riots in which 18 palestinians died 
israel is changing its tactics at a time of of increasing 
conflict among palestinians 
since june 1 twice as many palestinians have been killed by 
other palestinians as by soldiers most on suspicion of 
collaborating with israeli authorities 
assad saftawi an elementary school principal and leading plo 
supporter in the gaza strip described the new policy as a ploy by 
defense minister moshe arens to improve israels image abroad 
some prominent palestinians say the uprising is in trouble and 
seek a new longerterm strategy to revive morale 
hamdi faraj a journalist in bethlehem said plo chairman yasser 
arafat should acknowledge the revolt or intefadah has flagged and 
is unlikely to bring palestinian statehood in the new future 
there is a gap between what the plo says and what the people 
see he said the state is not a stones throw away like they 
claim in slogans 
at the dheishe refugee camp in the west bank several activists 
blamed palestine liberation organization policy for the revolts 
loss of impetus and accused arafat of making concessions without 
getting anything in return 
khaled 25 who says he has been wounded three times and served 
10 months in jail without trial said arens timed his change of 
strategy well the intefadeh has cooled down and arens played his 
cards at the right time because people are tired and not chasing 
after the army he said 
ibrahim 33 said the intefadeh has almost stopped and the 
people have to start realizing that they have to take the solution 
in their own hands and do it themselves he said younger men 
should be brought into the plo leadership 
neither gave his last name 
for the army the arens policy signifies reversal of a 
longstanding military doctrine of taking the offensive and 
confronting each small demonstration to keep riots from developing 
it was very strange for the soldiers who have been drilled to 
charge to attack and to fire to be told halt restrain 
yourselves the military commander said 
because of the relative quiet he said an army encampment set 
up in the middle of the village of beit hanun would be dismantled 
and the troops evacuated villagers were told soldiers would return 
in force at the first signs of violence 
restraint also was evident elsewhere 
from an army lookout post near the jabalia refugee camp black 
smoke could be seen rising as palestinian youths ignited a tire in 
the streets 
in the past such an act would have brought swift action by an 
army patrol and possibly casualties 
this time itzik a 21yearold first sergeant looked at the 
smoke and shrugged his shoulders 
well probably let it burn itself out he said besides 
it creates a lot of heavy black smoke and the palestinians have 
to breathe it if it were four or five tires then wed probably go 
in with a company of about 100 men he said 
politicians have praised the army for restraint but military 
sources said some soldiers of lower rank felt it could be 
interpreted as a sign of weakness 
young palestinians say they will carry the fight to the army 
arens might pull back the soldiers but in that case we will 
start chasing the army said fuad 17 who showed a reporter 
wounds behind the ear and on his arm from rubbercoated steel 
bullets

the united states may have saved saudi 
arabias rulers from being toppled by iraq but in the long run the 
military intervention in the persian gulf is fraught with peril for 
america and its arab friends 
unless the united states takes into account all the longterm 
implications of the situation its actions may produce a recipe for 
permanent upheaval rather than the regional stabilization which is 
its aim middle east analyst charles snow stressed 
iraqi president saddam husseins aug 2 conquest of kuwait has 
shaken the arab world polarizing it and triggering new and often 
surprising alliances 
in the immediate future the region will be very lucky 
indeed if theres not an explosion of potentially epic 
proportions snow said 
even if this can be avoided the future looks bleak said 
snow a veteran analyst with the nicosiabased middle east economic 
survey 
saddams internment of us and british hostages in baghdad and 
kuwait and president bushs decision to beef up the us military 
commitment including calling up military reserves for the first 
time in 20 years has raised the temperature in recent days 
apart from the prospect of war and the danger saddam will use 
chemical weapons there is the threat of a new wave of terrorist 
attacks on us and western targets in the mideast and beyond 
us intervention in lebanon in 1983 as part of a multinational 
peacekeeping force ended in disaster with nearly 300 usand 
french servicemen killed in suicide bombings by shiite moslem 
zealots 
the middle east was restive and uncertain even before saddam 
invaded kuwait 
the palestinian uprising in israelioccupied territories the 
end of superpower rivalry that cast the regions adrift and the 
flood of soviet jews to israel combined to radically alter the 
mideast equation 
by portraying himself as the islamic champion of the arab world 
and linking a withdrawal from kuwait with israels occupation of 
arab land saddam has widened his appeal to arab masses and the 
moslem world 
arab moderates have reluctantly gone along with us 
intervention in saudi arabia at king fahds request because they 
were unable to check saddam themselves 
but theyre uneasy about the american presence in such a 
sensitive and strategic region 
the less time the iraqis are given to whip up antiamerican 
sentiment in the arab world the better as far as washington is 
concerned snow noted 
shahram chubin a middle east specialist with genevas graduate 
institute of international studies noted the us presence in 
such force in the land of islams holiest places is likely to 
create a lot of discontent in the moslem world 
the semipermanent presence of the naval armada in the gulf 
could well eventually antagonize iran even though it has opposed 
iraqs invasion of kuwait he said in a telephone interview 
the longer the americans stay in the gulf the worse it will 
look for them he said the change in the arab order caused by 
iraqs actions will not necessarily be in americas favor the us 
intervention may have saved the saudi royal family for now but it 
could ultimately undermine them 
much depends on what saddam does next 
he basically has three options try to sit out the siege 
capitulate and withdraw from kuwait or fight 
capitulation is unlikely if he meekly returns kuwait to its 
emir sheik jaber alahmad alsabah saddam would suffer a 
catastrophic loss of face in the arab world he seeks to lead 
he would likely meet serious unrest at home that would raise 
the possibility of a putsch by the army 
his generals might feel that on top of saddams illadvised 
invasion of iran in 1980 a planned blitzkreig that bogged down 
into an eightyear war his miscalaculation over kuwait has made 
him a liability 
but the iraqi leader is cunning unpredictable and a ruthless 
survivor nothing can be taken for granted 
the americans also face the risk that if saddam opts for the 
long haul the international support washington has mustered could 
begin to dissipate 
if saddam threatened with economic strangulation by un 
sanctions and a barricade moves into jordan to secure his only 
lifeline he would trigger a powerful israeli response 
that would intensify the bitterness in many arab quarters 
against the united states israels main protector 
the americans some believe might move against saddam in kuwait 
if they detected signs he planned to play the israeli card in a bid 
to unite the arabs behind him 
israeli defense minister moshe arens stressed aug 7 the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait does not represent a geostrategic change 
for israel but the moment we see that were facing a change like 
the entrance of the iraqi army into jordan we will act 
king hussein of jordan saddams key arab ally is extremely 
vulnerable if he goes along with the sanctions he risks saddam 
turning on him as well as serious internal upheaval among his 3 
million people many of them palestinians who are strongly 
prosaddam 
it seems unlikely to the point of improbability that the 
americans are assembling this kind of firepower merely to watch the 
iraqis dig in in kuwait and if they intend to take more positive 
action they may have cogent reasons for doing so sooner rather than 
later snow noted 
once the united states has finished marshalling its forces in 
the region the battle for the gulf will be joined in earnest 
the only uncertainty seems to be when not whether the storm will 
break he added

an american marine from new york had one 
question when he arrived in this desert kingdom are the mets in 
first 
most of the thousands of us troops here have no access to 
american publications or any television so they incessantly ask 
visiting reporters about the situation back home 
do the american people want us here an army private on a 
desert exercise this week wanted to know 
is president bush saying well go to war asked an air force 
supply officer 
a mimeographed newsletter attempts to fill the void with a story 
headlined secretary of defense explains why we are here but 
it does little to satisfy the appetite of the newshungry americans 
the situation is very uncertain defense secretary dick 
cheney says in the newsletter we dont know how long it will 
last 
however there are signs the troops will be getting more access 
to the news a daily shipment of newspapers has been sent to some 
camps this week 
they get passed around and read again and again and again 
said a spokesman for the 82nd airborne the guys are hungry for 
news 
a few issues of the military newspaper stars amp stripes have 
turned up in the past few days and the small newsletter that 
carried cheneys remarks is being published at one saudi airbase 
where us forces are positioned 
iraq is trying to fill the news void with radio broadcasts 
suggesting that while americans are protecting saudi oil fields the 
petrol emirs are in the united states and have enjoyed the 
company of american women 
i thought it was pretty funny actually said a member of 
the 82nd airborne division who listened to the broadcast earlier 
this week if thats their idea of psychological warfare i dont 
think we have much to worry about 
the saudi media also has had its fair share of recent propaganda 
local television which can be seen by some us forces staying 
in hotels or saudi barracks frequently includes lengthy segments 
showing the arrival and exercises of troops in the kingdom there 
is no narration but patriotic music booms 
saudi papers carry daily dispatches from a state press agency 
designed to assure the public that the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
will not affect saudi arabias food supplies economy or security 
the saudi papers also have published numerous wire service 
stories about the crisis americans who live here say the local 
press never has been this open before 
but one 20yearold army driver didnt really need a newspaper 
to tell him what was going on 
he says he was told at a briefing that us troops were on a 
peacekeeping mission but he said he knew there was a good chance 
for combat 
how did he know 
they issued live rounds instead of blanks he said

iraqi president saddam husseins voice to 
the world in his war of words with president bush is a dapper 
television anchorman named miqdad muradi 
in the last two weeks while saddam has kept a low profile in 
the escalating crisis triggered by his aug2 invasion of kuwait 
muradi has read a string of statements from the president on iraqs 
staterun television network 
these broadcasts carried around the globe by cable news 
network have made the iraqi something of a tv star murad who 
bears a striking resemblance to saddam is always impeccably 
dressed in a dark suit and sober tie 
murad who is in his mid40s shows no sign of strain when he 
reads saddams often rambling statements calling bush a liar 
or announcing that thousands of americans and britons held by iraq 
are guests of his country 
muradi has been chief announcer on the iraqi network for several 
years 
during the 198088 war against iran he frequently read 
important statements usually announcing iraqi victories

saddam you were playing volleyball just now you were playing 
ian morton no yesterday 
s do you have a team here do you play with iraqis 
i yes 
s dont you play anything dont you play games stuart like 
what what do you play 
stuart football 
s and the ladies how are you passing time 
unidentified lady i cant say 
s i am an iraqi and i realize if i were in your shoes i would 
rather be in iraq my country but sometimes one is forced to face 
situations that are not of his own choice 
your presence here and in other places is meant to prevent the 
scourge of war to avoid war 
in arabic we say preventing danger there is a semantic and 
linguistic problem here we in our communique used the word dara 
in arabic which means to put away or to prevent or to avoid the 
scourge of war or the danger of war we used the word dara which 
means to prevent but when we used this word western media used 
misunderstood the pronunciation of the word dara into dera 
which means shield and they thought that we were using people as a 
dera which means shield rather than a dara which we meant 
which means to prevent war 
so there was a mis uh perhaps deliberate 
misinterpretation or inadvertant misinterpretation of our wording 
of our communique 
stuart for instance stuart will im sure be happy to have as 
part of his life or his history personal history that he played a 
role in maintaining peace so when he along with his friends and 
all those present here have played their role in preventing war 
then they will all be heroes of peace 
im sure that you all have your own journals and your own 
diaries perhaps and you will jot down whatever you have as 
feelings or recollections or impressions of these days and in any 
case your presence now and in this sort of atmosphere is not a 
source of pleasure to us 
this does not make us happy what would make us happy would be 
to see you back in your countries or back in baghdad in the normal 
way you used to do 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
s what is your name 
i ian 
s so please forgive us because we like you have our own 
children like ian and stuart and we also have our own women like 
you and have our own families and we know how you feel but we are 
trying to prevent a war from happening and we hope that you as 
guests wontt be here for too long 
now im prepared to listen to whatever you have to say and to 
answer any questions you may have 
unidentified woman first and foremost we appreciate that he 
saddam has come in person simply because no one else has been 
able to answer our questions 
s i am here to answer all your questions 
uw we have schoolgoing children here my sons got two sons 
school begins in about a weeks time and on the first of september 
and some of them are in the middle of important exams and that 
itself is going to cause immense problems 
s we hope that your presence here is not going to be long 
if by the time schooling begins and you are still here in iraq 
we are going to go to unusual efforts to make sure that the 
children are not deprived of their continued schooling and we will 
send to you experts from the ministry of education to see the 
curricula and the levels of schooling in which your children are so 
that everything will be prepared for the children not to lose the 
opportunity of school 
all religions urge us to learn more and more and in our religion 
the first time god almighty addressed his prophet mohammed praise 
be on his soul through gabriel as god said to mohammed through 
gabriel read so reading and learning is a fundamental thing in 
the life of man and we know what it means 
one would have wish that the kind of coincidence which occurred 
to you should have been reversed 
but it has happened and we are faced with the outcome of acts 
some of which have come by chance by pure coincidence and some 
which have come actually by deliberate feeling 
but we for our part will try to treat you in the same way as 
we treat iraqis because you are not hostages here we want nothing 
from britain or the us we want nothing from them they owe us 
nothing we owe them nothing 
a question should be addressed to them what has iraq taken 
from you that has made you come with your forces threatening iraq 
and the lands and territory of god and moslems what has iraq done 
to deserve this we want nothing from london or from any 
englishspeaking we have take nothing away from the us

uw2 were very concerned about our families at home we dont 
mind that were we realize that were of unknown destination 
but we would like them to know that we are fit and well our 
parents are old and in ill health 
s yes we shall make sure your messages will reach your family 
in england as of now you can write your letters and messages 
including photographs here then you can send it to them this is 
my instruction to my people here and it will be implemented as of 
now 
s i must be exact that regrettably nobody has conducted any 
negotiation or dialogue with us yet and garble he announced 
that iraq would be prepared to get into negotiations and the 
response was immediate it was quick the same way the us has 
responded to all our entreaties they said immediately that they 
were not prepared to conduct any dialogue with iraq until iraq has 
left kuwait as if kuwait were washington 
our response to this is that neither the iraqis nor the arabs in 
general would be prepared to accept dialogue and the blackmail or 
with preconditions if anybody is prepared to come and talk to us 
then they are welcome but not to blackmail 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
uw if it takes awhile will he saddam at least consider 
sending the children back to school 
s you must rest assured the more days you spend here your 
hopes should grow in the fact that we would be seeking 
energetically seeking a solution any possibility to resolve the 
situation and to clear it up 
1stman you tell us that there has been no negotiation with the 
west can he tell us is there any contact with the soviets 
s yes the east is more understanding as to the importance of 
dialogue especially if it were to be done in an atmosphere of 
peace 
we have so far issued two initatives and im sure youve seen 
those two initiatives or known about them one of which is 
concerned with you in which i addressed myself to your families 
one of the most regrettable ironies here is the fact that 
president bush who is the president of the greatest and biggest 
power on earth as they say in fact refused the initiative only a 
few hours after i issued it even before asking for the text 
in any case both bush and others are going to learn a great deal 
from iraq on the human level and even on the level of more 
accurate planning or considered planning all of this will be 
the fact that the iraqi people and arabs in general will teach them 
how to be closer to god 
and this is going to happen im happy to have seen you now even 
though i would have wished to have met you under different 
circumstances

bobbie mackenzie started out simply 
enough stuffing handfuls of matchbooks into a little box as 
mementoes of trips and special nights out thousands of matchbooks 
later she got serious 
like every other collector i thought i was the only one doing 
this recalled mackenzie one of about 500 matchbook cover 
collectors meeting in springfield this week 
matchcover collecting is probably one of the biggest hobbies 
in the world but one of the least known said chuck ledger 
chairman of the 50th annual rathkamp matchcover society meeting 
suddenly you find out that there are people who do this he 
said it becomes very engrossing after a while 
the rathkamp matchcover society traces its roots to 1939 when a 
group of enthusiasts visited the brooklyn navy yard in new york to 
pick up service and ship matchbooks and visit the new york worlds 
fair an informal meeting was held that year at the home of henry 
rathkamp of newport ri who died in 1940 
a group of the fellows got together and thought it would be 
kind of neat to go to the navy yards because it was world war ii 
and there was a lot of matchcovers available at that time ledger 
said they had such a good time doing it that they decided to 
make it an annual thing 
today the society has more than 1500 members in 16 countries 
on thursday groups of collectors ruffled through stacks of free 
matchcovers piled up on grab tables and wandered past exhibits 
the covers varied from scantily clad girlies of the 1940s to 
advertisements urging americans to buy war bonds and remember 
pearl harbor there were rafts of matchcovers commemorating 
battleships and nostalgic covers plugging big band groups more 
modern displays included complete sets of hotel chains and shiny 
gold and silver foil covers 
one of the clubs oldest members 81yearold bob oliver began 
collecting matchcovers in 1932 after he spied a shiny gold cover on 
the ground at the brooklyn navy yard 
from that casual start oliver who now lives in mira loma 
calif became an avid collector once traveling 87 miles in 
manhattan as he and his son collected matchbooks from different 
hotels 
most collectors strip the books of matches hence the term 
matchcover some amass labels from matchboxes serious 
collectors call themselves phillumenists 
explaining their hobby to outsiders can be difficult ledger 
said 
they think were crazy thats the first reaction he said 
its followed very closely by well what are they worth my 
standard answer is theyre not worth a darn thing 
in fact matchcover collectors call their passion the poor 
mans hobby auction prices generally range in the tens of 
dollars rather than the hundreds 
collectors many of whom are retirees said the most important 
thing about matchcover collecting is the friendships that go with 
it 
the key to this whole thing is the word hobby ledger said

although violence surrounds 
them many whites are watching the savage fighting between black 
factions as if it were happening in another country 
some whites worry about the turmoil and what it means for south 
africa and the chances of a peaceful future others say it proves 
the 5 million whites cannot share political power with the 30 
million blacks 
many whites just shake their heads and ignore the fighting 
its terrible theres no need for it but theres nothing we 
can do said jane king a white secretary 
in the white suburbs the fighting is something residents just 
read about in newspapers or watch on television some 500 blacks 
have been killed and at least 1400 injured in fighting in black 
townships around johannesburg this month 
the segregation of neighborhoods and the positioning of black 
townships in a belt around johannesburg has kept the killing at a 
distance even though some white and black areas are just a few 
hundred yards apart many whites rarely mix with blacks unless the 
blacks are workers or servants 
but moira smith a white woman who saw children fleeing fighting 
in the katlehong township was devastated by the scene 
there was blood on their clothes i will never forget the 
absolutely haunting look of terror in their eyes it was the most 
dreadful thing i have ever seen she said 
whites opposed to ending apartheid say whites will be killed if 
a black government ever takes power 
a white woman looking at a picture of armed black fighters while 
reading a newspaper in a shop exploded with anger 
look at them and they want our country its sickening 
she said 
some whites have written to newspapers warning the country is on 
the brink of war 
i can think of no parallel in recent history where a ruling 
powerful minority voluntarily abdicates control in the full 
knowledge that by so doing they are condemning themselves to 
permanent political subjugation by a largely semiliterate third 
world majority said a letter to the citizen newspaper signed 
alarmed and disturbed 
j allen said in another letter for how long is the white 
electorate going to allow this anarchic situation to continue 
president fw de klerk is negotiating with the african national 
congress on ending the apartheid system of racial segregation and 
sharing power with blacks 
the latest fighting has pitted zulu supporters of the 
conservative inkatha movement against xhosas many of them tied to 
the anc the largest black opposition group 
in the eastern province of natal blackonblack violence still 
continues after five years of fighting and some 5000 deaths 
the proapartheid conservative party the main opposition white 
party has attempted to use the black violence to bolster its 
challenge to de klerk it says the violence vindicates its position 
that a black government would lead to anarchy and bloodshed 
if one white person dies it will be on the governments 
conscience we will mobilize our people and stop them with 
violence said party spokesman koos van der merwe in a recent 
speech 
but so far there has been little indication of what impact the 
black violence is having on white political opinion government 
officials say the majority of whites still support de klerks 
reforms 
but political observers have expressed fears of a bloody power 
struggle between rival black groups if white rule ends 
nobody in his right mind can this time blame apartheid or the 
police this is a bloodletting between black and black that is 
something no one can excuse said the citizen newspaper in an 
aug 20 editorial

kuwaits government in exile is alive and 
well and forming a liberation army to help in any military action 
to free the country from iraqi occupation the kuwaiti crown prince 
says 
we will fight and fight and fight until we drive out the 
aggressors from our country prince saad abdullah al sabah said 
thursday we the kuwaitis will never submit or surrender to 
threats or to aggression or to occupation 
such talk is taken lightly here one saudi official for 
example said kuwait has a stealth army nobodys ever seen 
it 
but abdullah said some kuwaitis who fled their homeland after 
iraqs aug 2 invasion already are going back to help with a 
resistance movement others he said are planning to arm 
themselves and join the multinational force defending saudi arabia 
we will be reorganizing rearming reequipping with necessary 
arms to take part as an advance team in liberating our country 
he said abdullah the no 2 official of the kuwaiti government 
met with reporters at a hotel in a saudi mountain resort 
the hotel heavily guarded by saudi military police is serving 
as the headquarters for the kuwaiti royal family 
another family member said the governmentowned kuwait petroleum 
company would be operated from london during the iraqi occupation 
a third member of the al sabah family speaking privately said 
the kuwaiti government would prefer that the united states attack 
iraq and cut off its supply lines to kuwait ultimately forcing a 
withdrawal from kuwait 
we hope we do not have to destroy our country with war to get 
it back he said 
abdullah said two or three members of the al sabah royal family 
had been arrested in kuwait aides said the emir of kuwait was in 
the hotel but would not meet with reporters 
although many kuwaitis have taken refuge in saudi arabia and 
other nations abdullah declared the kuwaiti government is alive 
and well 
we will do everything he said we are willing to 
sacrifice everything not only our money and our funds but also our 
blood to liberate our country 
abdullah implored world leaders to enforce economic sanctions 
against iraq and said he believed iraqs saddam hussein would use 
his troops in kuwait to satisfy his aggressive designs on saudi 
arabia 
the unjustified and unlawful aggression has shown to all the 
world the real designs and the real expansionist ambitions of the 
iraqi regime he said 
a kuwaiti resistance movement he said is growing day by day 
it has been escalating and will continue to escalate 
before abdullah spoke ali jaber al sabah a member of the royal 
family who serves as marketing director for the governmentowned 
kuwait petroleum co said kuwaitis still in their country have 
reported that two palaces are being used as concentration camps 
for women and children arrested at demonstrations 
jaber said recent reports indicate food is getting scarce in 
kuwait but that looting was not as common as in the days 
immediately following the invasion

in shaping their policies on the gulf 
crisis turkish leaders had on their minds the nations problems 
with its large kurdish minority according to official sources and 
commentators 
they suggest that turkey is taking an active role in the crisis 
now so that it will be listened to later according to these 
commentators turkey wants to make sure that any new order that 
might emerge in the region does not include an independent state 
for kurds 
so far turkey has refrained from any military involvement in 
the crisis triggered by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait but this 
option has not been ruled out 
but the nato ally gave a major push to an international economic 
embargo by cutting off two iraqi oil pipelines across its 
territory it also imposed a trade ban and forbade iraq its 
neighbor from using turkish roads or airspace to transport goods 
many turks including opposition party leaders have questioned 
the swiftness of these moves they say turkeys longstanding policy 
of not antagonizing mideast neighbors may have been jettisoned for 
dubious returns and without sufficient deliberation 
president turgut ozal however thought this was no time for 
procrastination and staying on the sidelines sources close to the 
president report 
the reasoning goes this way the united states appears 
determined to bring down iraqs saddam hussein and make the persian 
gulf oilfields secure probably this will lead to war a peace 
conference will eventually follow maybe carving up iraq and 
setting up a new order in the region 
turkey would like to sit at the conference table to make sure 
that an independent kurdistan does not emerge and national 
interests are not jeopardized 
those who say lets not get involved should also answer the 
question how turkey could prevent it if the idea was brought to a 
conference table for the establishment of a kurdish state said 
ertugrul ozkok on monday in the independent istanbul daily hurriyet 
similar commentaries appeared in other papers after ozal gave a 
background briefing to commentators and editors of turkish 
newspapers over the weekend 
an estimated 20 million kurds live in an area where the borders 
of turkey the soviet union iran iraq and syria converge turkey 
has the largest group an estimated 10 million out of a population 
of 55 million 
several thousand guerrillas members of the marxist kurdish 
labor party pkk have been fighting for an independent kurdish 
state in turkeys southeastern provinces about 2500 civilians 
security personnel and guerrillas have been killed since the 
fighting began in 1984 
the guerrillas operate from bases in iraq and syria staging 
hitandrun attacks on turkish settlements and military convoys 
the mainly kurdish local population basically remains loyal to 
the central turkish government but they have been complaining of 
being caught in the middle of the guerrilla war suffering 
mistreatment from the security forces and facing bullets from the 
guerrillas 
also the kurds are demanding some form of cultural autonomy 
allowing them to use their language publicly without harassment 
currently they cannot speak kurdish in official places or use it in 
broadcasts education and publications they also want increased 
state investments to improve the economic lot of their backward 
region 
these demands have received support from the main opposition 
social democrat populist party 
before the outbreak of the gulf crisis the united states 
appeared to be supporting kurdish aspirations giving them voice in 
a congressional report on human rights issued last spring 
on the iraqi side the kurds fought the baghdad government 
during the eightyear iraniraq war shortly after a ceasefire 
with iran two years ago iraq attacked its kurdish population with 
chemical weapons 
some 60000 kurds fleeing chemical bomb attacks took refuge in 
turkey and about 40000 still remain in refugee camps in 
southeastern turkey

reports of the political demise of ousted former 
governor evan mecham may have been premature 
the feisty former car dealers campaign to reclaim the arizona 
governors office is very much alive and he remains in the thick of 
the fiveway race for the republican nomination 
he has a good chance he has a very good chance said 
phoenix pollster earl de berge 
other pollsters and consultants are careful to hedge their bets 
if the turnout is under 35 percent mecham could win it 
said bruce merrill director of the media research center at 
arizona state university 
major polls show that millionaire land developer fife symington 
is leading the gop race with mecham battling former congressman 
sam steiger for second place and two other candidates trailing 
former phoenix mayor terry goddard is the oddson favorite to 
win the democratic primary facing only token opposition 
the governors race was thrown wide open when democrat rose 
mofford the former secretary of state who inherited mechams job 
in 1988 decided not to seek election this year 
polls show large numbers of republicans still have not made up 
their minds less than a month before the sept 11 primary 
thirtytwo percent remained undecided according to de berges 
latest survey and merrills most recent poll showed 43 percent 
undecided 
mecham 66 captured the governors office in 1986 on his fifth 
try but his term was cut short in april 1988 when he was impeached 
by the state house and convicted by the senate of misusing money 
from supporters and interfering with a police investigation of an 
alleged death threat by one of his aides 
his opponents were quick to pronounce mecham politically dead 
but polls consistently have shown that he maintained the base of 
support that helped him win the threeway gubernatorial race four 
years ago 
none of the gop candidates has done extensive advertising and 
all seem to be having trouble raising money analysts say 
developers banks savings and loans most of the big sources 
of money have dried up this year merrill said most of those 
people are struggling to save their own butts 
some potential contributors reportedly have become reluctant to 
give to republicans because they believe as ev mecham rises in 
the polls it makes a goddard win in november almost a certainty 
said jeff hill a republican state senator and political consultant 
political consultant bob robb said mecham is the candidate who 
will suffer the least from a lack of contributions 
mecham has all the support hes going to get robb said 
people have already made up their minds about him one way or the 
other 
mecham also is closely identified with many of this years key 
issues including the martin luther king holiday taxes and voter 
dissatisfaction with government 
mecham has campaigned actively against the king holiday passed 
by the legislature this year he spearheaded the referendum drive 
to place the holiday on the november ballot and could cash in at 
the polls on a strong antiholiday sentiment among republicans 
the king holiday has become a partisan issue with republicans 
generally opposing it and democrats in support merrill said 
mechams campaign also got a boost when the legislature passed a 
265 million tax increase at a time when the states economy 
already was suffering analysts say 
i have never seen so much dissatisfaction with incumbents 
with government merrill said i have never seen an 
antiincumbent feeling as high as it is this year 
mechams best shot at winning the primary is for voter turnout 
to be low pollsters say 
merrill said a generally lackluster campaign almost ensures that 
most voters will stay at home 
its not unfair to say that none of the candidates has 
captured the imagination of the voters he said 
hill agreed that a low voter turnout would favor mecham who 
appears to have the most solid core of support of any of the 
candidates 
mechams base makes him real tough hill said if he is 
able to hold onto those people hell be hard to beat if theres no 
turnout

the mideast crisis has people talking about 
conservation again but few are actually doing anything about it 
phone lines started ringing at energy conservation advice lines 
right after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 as consumers fearing 
higher prices sought tips to cut their consumption 
in minneapolis the metropolitan transit commission used iraqi 
president saddam husseins picture and the slogan stop pumping 
him up in an advertising campaign to suggest that people use 
city buses rather than their cars 
so far however little suggests people are driving less 
investing in more efficient home heating or following the bush 
administrations cautious suggestions for gasoline savings 
they arent feeling the pinch as they did in the 1970s said 
mary ann dittmer director of communications for the 
washingtonbased alliance to save energy they arent standing in 
line for gasoline prices for home heating oil havent gone through 
the roof 
nonetheless she said we have received many phone calls from 
consumers who want to do something 
callers are sent brochures telling how better light bulbs 
programmable thermostats special windows and highefficiency 
burners can save money and help reduce imports of foreign oil 
the energy department said calls to its tollfree energysaving 
tips line went from about 500 a week to 1200 a day immediately 
after the invasion 
at the gas and electric utility consolidated edison in new york 
spokesman marty gitten said some callers are thinking about 
converting from fuel oil to natural gas heat as happened after the 
oil shocks of the 1970s 
weve had a surge in people interested in converting to gas 
heating he said i cant say its going to translate into 
action 
the story is much the same at the gas pumps 
i think about it but im trimmed down to what i can to 
said gary oddi of reston va after driving into a gas station in 
washington my wife and i share a car 
i have a certain driving pattern and theres not a lot i can 
do about it said the next customer william leedy as he pumped 
gas into his car i think ive got my automobile usage down as 
low as itll go 
in minneapolis bus revenues for the first two weeks in august 
were about the same as last years but officials said that was an 
improvement because revenues earlier had been falling 
last week energy secretary james d watkins proposed steps to 
boost us oil production while asking drivers to trim their 
gasoline use by joining car pools obeying speed limits and keeping 
their tires properly inflated 
geoff sundstrom a spokesman at american automobile association 
headquarters in orlando fla said regular nationwide checks show 
no signs that drivers are cutting back to save on gasoline 
the stations are telling us they do not see a change in the 
sales pattern for this time of year sundstrom said people 
arent panic buying but at this point they dont seem to be 
conserving either 
auto sales have dropped this month but analysts say thats 
because of general economic worries not concern about gas guzzlers 
people are not switching to smaller cars theres no evidence 
of that whatsoever said joel pitcoff manager of research and 
analysis at ford motor co 
a wall street journalnbc news poll published thursday found 
that 80 percent of those questioned said they favored tougher 
conservation measures that would mean less gas consumption but 
it was not clear what steps would really be popular if enacted 
the same poll found just 32 percent backing a higher gas tax to 
encourage conservation with 62 percent opposed and 6 percent not 
sure 
secretary watkins and president bush have been careful not to 
let any note of sacrifice enter their calls for conservation 
frustrating activists who want more vigorous steps 
bush told reporters wednesday that now is a good time to 
conserve energy but he does not plan to give up using his 
speedboat and doesnt think americans should change their vacation 
plans 
id have to lay part of the blame on the administration for 
not making conservation seem as urgent as it is said ms dittmer 
of the alliance to save energy 
while the president finally used the words energy 
conservation as us troops were on their way to the persian gulf 
he has so far failed to propose any significant policies to reduce 
dependence on oil christopher flavin an energy expert at 
worldwatch institute said at a news conference thursday

but he said officers in 15 states and puerto rico may not be 
trained for drug detection because their laws either do not allow 
more than one chemical test or forbid testing for drugs other than 
alcohol when a driver is stopped on the highway 
we encourage these states to change their laws during the next 
legislative cycle curry said in a statement released this week 
by his office drugimpaired drivers like drunk drivers cause 
crashes injuries and deaths on our highways 
curry said studies indicate that 10 percent to 22 percent of all 
drivers in serious and fatal crashes have drugs other than alcohol 
in their systems and many have alcohol as well as other drugs 
alcohol use has been found in accidents accounting for about half 
of the 45000 annual traffic fatalities 
curry said that wherever possible the federal government has 
been helping train police to test accurately for other drugs and 
present the evidence in court 
more than 1000 police officers have been trained in the 
communities he said with onefourth of them certified to teach 
other officers 
officers trained in drug detection look for physical clues in 
suspects to determine which drug they have taken curry said 
including analysis of the suspects appearance behavior 
performance in physical tests eyes and vital signs 
officers undergo a training course that consists of seven days 
of classroom study followed by drug examination on people arrested 
on suspicion of drug impairment he said 
states that have communities where officers have received the 
training are arizona california colorado florida indiana new 
york nevada texas utah and virginia 
states that have laws which would not allow for drugdetection 
training are alabama alaska connecticut hawaii kentucky 
massachusetts mississippi montana new jersey north carolina 
oregon south dakota tennessee washington and west virginia

iraqi ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat like 
his boss saddam hussein is very much on the defensive these days 
the useducated diplomat until recently one of the faceless 
legions of foreign representatives who swim unobtrusively in 
washingtons diplomatic backwaters has been much in evidence as 
the world vilifies iraq for one alleged transgression after another 
in television appearances letters to newspapers and embassy 
news conferences the graying mustachioed almashat vigorously 
defends iraqi policy but abctv newswoman barbara walters told the 
washington post after she interviewed almashat that he dodged her 
questions 
this ambassador obviously knows nothing walters said 
almashat turns aside allegations that iraq is violating 
international norms most recently with baghdads announcement that 
westerners will suffer alongside iraqis if the unsanctioned 
economic embargo persists 
when you deny our children food and milk what do you 
expect almashat said sunday in an assertive sometimes 
bellicose interview on abctv 
almashat ambassador to the united states since last september 
said recently in dossier magazine that his priority was to reverse 
a tide of unflattering press reports about his country 
in a letter to the washington post last month he said a july 5 
oped piece on iraq bordered upon irresponsible and dishonest 
journalism 
he said iraqs policy was one of deterrence in the face of many 
enemies and that baghdad was seeking only peace after a 
protracted destructive war with iran 
he denied that iraq had used poison gas on its kurdish 
population and labeled as a cheap shot the post writers 
assertion that iraq was giving office space to terrorist abu nidal 
in a may 4 opinion piece in the new york times almashat said 
many lies have been told about iraq 
he said iraq does not have or intend to produce nuclear weapons 
and that saddam has proposed the elimination of production 
storage and use of all instruments of mass destruction 
specifically a ban on all chemical biological and nuclear 
weapons in the middle east 
almashat 59 is a former ambassador to the united kingdom 
france and austria he also has held highlevel posts in education 
and scientific research in his country he was a professor of 
sociology at baghdad university 
he received a bachelors and masters degree in criminology at 
the university of california at berkeley and a phd in sociology 
from the university of maryland

joe wilson has built a career on hardship 
posts but nothing compares with his current job as americas top 
diplomat in baghdad 
joseph c wilson iv deputy chief of mission at the us embassy 
in iraq is washingtons ranking diplomat in baghdad he is the man 
who every day must confront iraqi officials to tell them that iraq 
must withdraw from kuwait and release the 3000 americans held 
hostage in iraq and kuwait 
with ambassador april glaspie out of the country it was wilson 
who went facetoface with iraqi president saddam hussein for two 
hours on aug 6 demanding that the safety of americans be 
guaranteed and listening to saddams steely warnings against us 
intervention 
he has been out on the streets talking to and tracking down 
americans and is a frequent visitor to the iraqi foreign ministry 
where his appeals for access to americans have been spurned 
its a heady task for the 40yearold career diplomat who once 
worked as a carpenter and served mainly in african backwaters 
before going to iraq 
president bush for one believes wilson has the right stuff 
weve got a very able person there in baghdad who is prepared to 
talk bush said at a wednesday news conference if the iraqis 
want to open discussions on ending the crisis well there he is 
available to talk 
he can handle himself quite well in a crisis said jack 
bryant deputy executive director of the state department bureau of 
african affairs and wilsons longtime colleague he can deal with 
anyone including saddam bryant said joe could go in and be 
very forceful 
wilson worked for a time as a carpenter in northern california 
after graduating from the university of california in 1972 bryant 
said he joined the foreign service in 1976 and was assigned to the 
frenchspeaking africa desk because of his fluency in french as a 
boy he had lived four years in france when his father was a 
freelance reporter for the san francisco chronicle and other 
newspapers 
bryant said wilsons first big assignment was doing the 
groundwork for secretary of state henry kissingers first african 
tour in the late 1970s 
he was posted in turn to niger togo and south africa and in 
1982 became deputy chief of mission or dcm in the tiny central 
african state of burundi it was there he met his second wife a 
french citizen friends say was of vietnamese descent 
in 1986 wilson was appointed dcm in the congo a post he held 
until taking his first nonafrican position as secondincharge in 
baghdad in 1988 
one foreign service colleague who asked that his name not be 
used said wilsons lack of training in middle east affairs should 
not affect his performance in the current crisis 
hes very bright very energetic as a generalist he has a 
broad scope of things he has to take care of hes certainly 
capable of standing up to saddam hussein to make any message and 
he would do it unflinchingly 
the foreign service officer said wilson liked the challenge of 
a hardship environment when you go to an african post you have 
more responsibility and joe liked being a generalist 
another diplomat who worked with wilson in the congo said wilson 
was a damned good dcm hes an expert at managing the embassy 
inside while keeping contacts outside thats the kind of guy you 
want in this spot 
wilsons wife returned to her family in france soon after iraqs 
invasion his mother phyllis wilson of the palm springs area said 
she was able to talk to her son this week and he sounded great 
hes in good spirits

the united states imported record levels of 
farm goods in the first half of this year but also increased its 
share of sales on the world market the agriculture department says 
imports rose 6 percent at 135 billion to break a record set 
last year the agriculture department predicts that purchases from 
foreign countries will reach 22 billion before the year is over 
topping the record set last year of 215 billion 
the freeze in the united states last winter was a big factor in 
increased imports it drove up the average import unit values for 
fresh vegetables by 37 percent through april said usda 
tomato import unit values alone doubled in the first half of 
fiscal 1990 the department said fruit imports rose 10 percent 
in the first 7 months and will probably maintain that pace for the 
entire fiscal year primarily due to higher orange juice imports 
the agriculture department said beef imports from australia were 
stronger than anticipated because of dry weather there high prices 
in the united states and frozen beef storage problems in japan 
other large quantity imports included live cattle from canada 
and mexico 
on the other hand more overseas sales of cotton corn and 
vegetables offset decreases in wheat soybeans soybean meal 
animals and dairy products to raise total exports to 252 billion 
during the first seven months of fiscal 1990 a 3 percent increase 
over the comparable period in 1989 
us export volume rose largely because of an increased us 
share of world markets rather than an increase in world demand 
said usda china thailand argentina and canada all relinquished 
market share to the united states leaving what was likely the 
second largest us share of world corn trade ever 
japan americas best customer for the last three years bought 
21 percent of the agriculture products exported in 1989 usda 
reported 
japans 1989 purchases were more than double the value shipped 
to the soviet union the second leading importer of us farm 
products it said 
japan spent more than 250 million on each of the following 
commodities live animals and meat feed grains soybeans fruits 
cotton wheat hides and skins feeds and fodders vegetables and 
tobacco 
the other top markets for us farm products in order are 
mexico south korea canada the netherlands taiwan and china

the potato leafhopper which attacks crops 
from the northeast through the corn belt has an enemy that may 
eventually be a cheaper way for farmers to destroy it than chemical 
pesticides 
zoophthora radicans a fungus imported from europe and south 
america can kill the leafhopper in three to four days according 
to entomologist raymond carruthers of the agriculture departments 
research service 
the fungus spews spores that fall onto leafhoppers and also 
sticks to leaf surfaces where the pests might cross 
leafhoppers attack more than 200 crops including potatoes and 
alfalfa said carruthers farmers in the northeast and midwest 
probably apply more insecticides to control potato leafhoppers than 
any other pest in alfalfa

greater than 
washington ap the agriculture department is authorizing 
construction of three telescopes on arizonas mt graham in the 
coronado national forest as long as the habitat of the endangered 
mt graham red squirrel is not disrupted significantly 
as a practical matter this means that the project would be 
halted and consultation reinitiated if the project resulted in 
more than six squirrels being harmed in any year said george m 
leonard associate chief of the us forest service 
the university of arizona proposed construction of the 
telescopes in 1984 the university said the project would 
significantly advance the state of astronomical science 
sponsors of the observatory include the smithsonian institution 
the vatican and the max planck institute of west germany 
leonard said the us fish and wildlife service will monitor and 
report on the effect of construction on the squirrel population he 
said a buffer zone around the observatory site would carry special 
restrictions

draft registration jumped to 29 percent above 
average after us forces were sent to saudi arabia but there are 
no plans to restart the military draft because of the persian gulf 
crisis the selective service says 
lew brodsky assistant director for public affairs at the 
selective service system said 36485 drafteligible young men 
signed up during the week of aug 1317 compared with a weekly 
average of 28289 in the preceding 12 months 
brodsky said selective service officials assumed that the us 
response to iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait made young people more 
aware of the registration requirement 
they may have thought that if a draft might be imminent they 
would want to get their names on the books brodsky said thursday 
however he said there are no plans to seek congressional 
approval for a draft and there have been no discussions about it 
with the white house the defense department or members of congress 
sen ernest hollings dsc has introduced a bill in most 
recent sessions of congress to reinstate the draft saying the 
present volunteer system puts the burden of military service 
unfairly on blacks and other minorities 
john patterson hollings press secretary said hollings has not 
reintroduced the bill in this session and we have not talked 
about it in light of what just happened hollings was in south 
carolina and not available patterson said 
the last us military draft ended in 1973 under current law 
men have to register when they reach 18 but it would take action 
by congress before they could be drafted 
pentagon leaders have said in recent years that they do not 
favor a return to the draft and have told congress they believe the 
nation can continue to attract enough recruits to avoid one 
samuel lessey director of selective service told the senate 
armed services committee in 1987 that the aim of the service was to 
be able to produce the first inductee within 13 days and 100000 
within 30 days if a draft were instituted 
he said 14 million to 15 million men were registered about 96 
or 97 percent of the total number eligible 
rep peter defazio dore introduced a bill in may to end 
draft registration saying the need for it had been eliminated by 
the wave of democracy spreading through the soviet union and 
eastern europe neither defazio nor his spokesman could be reached

oxygen tanks respirators and 
intravenous tubes share cabin space with sleeping bags and 
backpacks at skip camp a retreat for children whose medical 
needs make them dependent on technology 
theyre doing things they thought they would never do said 
susan spielman of bloomington whose 8yearold daughter maren 
prepared to go water skiing on wednesday 
the girl undertook the adventure although she suffers from 
central sleep apnea a condition that requires she have a 
tracheostomy or a permanent opening in her neck so she can be 
connected to a respirator while she sleeps 
the opening was covered and secured with a thick white towel for 
the waterskiing outing 
the camp is a project of sick kids need involved people a new 
yorkbased national organization in its fourth year skip camp 
offers children and their families a chance to break routines that 
often keep them sheltered from outdoor activities 
so many of these kids were prisoners in their homes or 
hospitals said camp director barbara donaghy who volunteers her 
time along with the other 50 medical and 75 nonmedical staffers 
running the oneweek camp eighteen children from around the nation 
attended this year 
donaghy a registered nurse and respiratory therapist said the 
idea behind the camp is to balance improved technology with similar 
steps toward bettering patients quality of life 
most of these kids would not have lived 10 years ago she 
said theres more and more technology but we dont always 
follow through with other things 
skip camp is unique because it involves entire families 
doesnt focus on a specific disease and is run at no cost to 
campers donaghy said the annual budget of about 50000 is funded 
by donations and volunteer efforts 
the 24hour medical staff reassures parents that their 
childrens needs will be met despite the camps rustic atmosphere 
families share living quarters in cabins where sophisticated 
machines hum alongside spartan bunk beds 
at mealtimes the campers families and volunteers gather in a 
large dining hall youngsters whose medical conditions require they 
be fed intravenously sit next to others who chomp on peanut butter 
sandwiches jello and other camp fare 
betty pankratz of wichita kan said the camp is giving new 
confidence to her 10yearold son scott who was born with a 
malfunction of his trachea and esophagus that requires he have a 
tracheostomy receive oxygen and have supplemental feedings through 
a tube in his stomach 
he fits right in said pankratz whose husband glen and 
6yearold son phillip also attended the camp it doesnt seem 
unusual for him to have to leave the group to take meds 
its a lot of fun and im meeting people that i like said 
scott who tried horseback riding swimming boating and other 
outdoor activities i know i wouldnt be doing this stuff at home 
theres really nothing to be afraid of he said 
donaghy who helped found skip camp in the miami area four 
years ago said she hopes the camp will let technologydependent 
children focus on their abilities instead of their disabilities 
most of the campers medical problems will continue throughout 
their lifetimes but the camp experiences can show them how to 
overcome limitations 
it doesnt have to stop your life she said

workers excavating storage tanks at a uranium 
processing plant found levels of radioactive uranium in underground 
water as much as 35000 times higher than federal safety standards 
allow officials said thursday 
sequoyah fuels corp vice president ron adkisson said there was 
no danger to the public because the contamination was contained 
inside the plants restricted area 
none of the companys 243 workers were exposed to radiation he 
said and no evacuations were ordered at the plant which is 60 
miles southeast of tulsa in a sparsely populated area 
theres been no exposure to personnel he said there is 
no offsite danger 
the us nuclear regulatory commision is investigating the 
discovery 
adkisson said workers discovered the contaminated water 
wednesday while the plant was in its annual shutdown for 
maintenance some of the water samples ranged from 1 to 8 grams of 
uranium per liter 
guidelines set by the nrc allow no more than 225 micrograms of 
uranium per liter a gram contains 1 million micrograms 
adkisson said he didnt know when the company could reopen the 
factory which refines uranium to be made into fuel rods for 
nuclear reactors 
plant officials believe the uranium leaked years ago from the 
solvent extraction building where pure uranium is dissolved using 
an acid solvent 
an acidresistant floor installed in the building in 1984 would 
have prevented such leaks adkisson said 
in some years past very early in the operation the material 
apparently ate through the floor and got through the 
substructure adkisson said we discovered it yesterday 
the nrc was notified the same day and sent an investigator from 
its arlington texas office he said 
they have a fellow out right now hes just trying to figure 
out whats going on trying to assess best he can just like us 
sequoyah fuels is owned by general atomics of san diego which 
bought the plant from kerrmcgee corp in 1988 
in january as many as 20000 pounds of uranium tetrafluoride 
powder spilled at the plant after a valve failed and the powder was 
dumped into a toosmall container 
a small amount of the powder was released into the air through a 
ventilator and one worker underwent hospital testing 
the company suspended operations but did not notify the nrc 
until the following day drawing criticism from democratic us 
rep mike synar whose district includes the plant 
in 1986 an accident killed one man who inhaled toxic fumes 
after an overfilled cylinder of uranium hexafluoride exploded 
thirtyfive of 42 workers at the plant suffered kidney damage and 
100 people living or traveling near the plant required medical 
treatment the plant was closed nearly a year

the us embassy in kuwait the latest storm 
center of the growing persian gulf crisis is recalled by 
diplomats who served there as a cluster of modest buildings across 
a sixlane highway from the beach 
it normally has a contingent of about a halfdozen marines who 
were withdrawn thursday as todays iraqiset deadline for the 
closing of foreign embassies in kuwait approached 
its not a very fancy embassy but a very functional one 
said francois dickman a retired foreign service officer who was 
us ambassador to kuwait from 1979 to 1983 
its not one of the new fortresses that many american 
embassies around the world are increasingly said another 
diplomat who has served in kuwait who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
dickman speaking by telephone from his home in laramie wyo 
said the embassy is in a compound surrounded by a wall eight or 
nine feet high 
it is a rectangle running north and south with the east side 
facing gulf road a sixlane highway just east of the highway is 
the persian gulf 
its not much of a beach said dickman 
the compound is roughly two city blocks wide by four blocks 
long the former ambassador said directly to the south is a hilton 
hotel seven or eight stories high 
the only entrance to the compound is a steel gate on the west 
side about 100 feet from the southwest corner 
as you enter you see the chancery he said the chancery 
is one story it was a plain stone building with a corrugated 
roof 
dickman said the road then bends north to the site of the 
administration building a brick structure that was destroyed in a 
terrorist bombing on dec 12 1983 the building has since been 
rebuilt 
also in the compound are the twostory ambassadors residence a 
warehouse a parking lot and a garden just east of the ambassadors 
house in which vegetables were grown in dickmans day 
there also is a swimming pool 
in the 1983 bombing shia moslem terrorists crashed a truck 
loaded with gas cylinders through the steel gates it smashed into 
the administration building demolishing it and also damaging the 
chancery and warehouse dickman said six people were killed 
including the truck driver but none were americans 
since then the security system has been strengthened according 
to the diplomat who spoke anonymously 
i suppose a tank like an iraqi tank could get through but 
it has been reinforced the wall has been upgraded and the entry 
gates this diplomat said 
dickman said that when he was ambassador the marines lived a 
block away from the embassy compound but he later heard they were 
living within the enclosure he applauded the decision to withdraw 
them 
it makes sense he said these marines cant do anything 
there are only six of them it is possible the number has been 
increased but normally it is only a contingent of six 
they dont really serve as guards dickman said they man 
the entrance to the chancery and in the evening they make sure that 
things are locked up and provide elementary security 
the diplomats obviously had pleasant memories of the place 
the time i was there we had a little victory garden along the 
edge of the wall said dickman 
i remember it being very green and pretty said his 
colleague

israelies are stocking up on emergency supplies 
including baking soda an antidote to chemical weapons while 
government broadcasts urge citizens to prepare for a possible iraqi 
chemical attack 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said thursday the persian gulf 
crisis is mounting toward a peak and caused a minor flurry when 
he appeared to hint a preemptive israeli strike against iraq was 
possible 
when questioned however he said israel had no such intentions 
in the governments first public response to israelis growing 
fear of war a top civil defense officer urged israelis to 
stockpile food and prepare their homes for a possible iraqi 
chemical attack 
later the government put out an announcement saying the radio 
and television statements werent intended as orders to citizens 
but as general advice 
the announcement described how to mix a homemade antidote to 
chemical weapons newspapers published advice on how to seal a home 
against chemical attack with tape and how to rig a makeshift gas 
mask using a handkerchief or towel soaked with water and baking 
soda 
at the supersol supermarket in downtown jerusalem baking soda 
was sold out thursday and shop workers said they were selling four 
or five times more baking soda than usual 
at houminers hardware store in jerusalem manager avraham yosha 
reported a 40 percent increase in the sale of insulating tape 
emergency lights cans for water as well as portable toilets and 
wash basins for shelters and sealed rooms 
addressing visiting american contributors to the united jewish 
appeal at the parliament shamir said in the circumstances our 
major task is to prevent war or to preempt it and if heaven 
forbid these two fail and there is no alternative we have to win 
quickly and decisively 
but speaking later to reporters shamir qualified those remarks 
saying israels aim was still to prevent any military involvement 
of our country in spite of iraqs attempts to drag it into the 
threeweekold crisis 
asked specifically whether israel planned a preemptive strike in 
the aftermath of iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait shamir said 
no not at all 
but in his speech shamir said israel must be on alert in view 
of developments in the region he said the crisis in the persian 
gulf is mounting toward a peak 
we are ready for any development that may take place there 
are factors in the region that would like to draw us into an armed 
conflict we need strong nerves patience and a high state of 
readiness shamir said

all he wanted phoenix financier charles h 
keating jr said was a day in court to tell his side of how his 
lincoln savings amp loan association came to represent the epitome of 
the quartertrilliondollar sampl debacle 
us district judge stanley sporkin gave keating his day in 
fact more than 30 days of hearings and then ruled thursday that 
keating and his associates used a dishonest scheme to loot 
lincoln for tens of millions of dollars in federally insured 
deposits 
bluntly speaking their actions amounted to a looting of 
lincoln said sporkin an accountant by training and formerly the 
top enforcement officer at the securities and exchange commission 
this was not done crudely indeed it was done with a great deal 
of sophistication 
dismissing keatings suit to recover the collapsed irvine 
calif thrift sporkin said it was abundantly clear that 
keating and other officials of lincolns holding company american 
continental corp of phoenix abused their positions 
it was the second legal setback in two days for keating who 
complained he was being made a scapegoat for the sampl crisis because 
of his 13 million in campaign gifts to five senators who 
intervened on his behalf with federal thrift regulators in 1987 
a federal judge in california said wednesday that keating must 
prove hes broke may not send any money out of the country and 
must give 48 hours notice before spending more than 5000 
the federal office of thrift supervision sought that action as 
part of an effort to recover 409 million from keating and five 
associates in connection with three soured business deals at 
lincoln 
bradley boland a spokesman for american continental and a 
soninlaw of keating said in response to sporkins ruling that 
the company is reviewing all of its options and has no comment at 
this time 
keating had indicated earlier that he would appeal a negative 
decision well be fighting to the day im dead he told 
reporters in june i have no intention of being raped by the us 
government 
timothy ryan director of the office of thrift supervision that 
last year succeeded the federal home loan bank board as the sampl 
industrys chief regulator called the ruling an extremely 
important decision 
as the courts are now confirming ryan said ots has the 
authority to see that those who have abused the savings and loan 
system and the american taxpayer will not be permitted to do so 
again and they will not be permitted to retain one cent of their 
illgotten gains 
regulators have estimated that keatings use of lincolns 
federally insured deposits to finance various junk bond stock and 
real estate ventures and the institutions subsequent collapse 
could cost taxpayers as much as 2 billion 
the government already has spent 12 billion keeping lincoln 
and its more than 20 branches in southern california afloat 
according to lawyers in the case the government also has a 13 
billion civil fraud and racketeering suit pending against keating 
this is a saga that demonstrates the excesses of a 
misconceived and misapplied regulatory program along with a group 
of individuals who were bent on exploiting these excesses 
sporkin said in his 51page ruling thursday 
but the judge also blamed the literally scores of accountants 
and lawyers that keating surrounded himself with to give an 
aura of legality to transactions that regulators claim were 
fraudulent 
while we in this nation have been trying to place blame for 
the savings and loan crisis on the various governmental 
participants this court believes far too little has been 
focused on the private sector sporkin said 
five senators now being investigated by the senate ethics 
committee have cited the audits by the accounting firm of arthur 
young amp co and a favorable report by federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan as reasons for interceding on keatings behalf 
the five sens alan cranston dcalif donald w riegle jr 
dmich dennis deconcini dariz john glenn dohio and john 
mccain rariz have denied any wrongdoing

researchers say they have isolated a normal 
gene that can prevent testtube colonies of cancer tumors from 
growing 
the experiment with a gene called p53 could lead to finding 
natural proteins to switch off cancer the results of the research 
at the johns hopkins oncology center in baltimore appear today in 
the journal science 
they have reached the genetic root of the problem of 
malignancy said dr john s macdonald director of the temple 
university cancer center in philadelphia 
the observation that you change the growth properties of 
cancer cells by inserting the normal gene is significant said 
dr berton zbar a national cancer institute scientist 
p53 is one of a group of what is known as suppressor genes 
because they appear to act as a brake on cancer formation said 
suzanne baker a hopkins cancer researcher suppressor genes have 
been found to be either missing or mutated in the cells of several 
types of solid cancer tumors she said 
what we assume is the fact that a normal copy of the p53 gene 
missing in these cells is important in the formation of the 
cancer she said 
baker said inserting the normal p53 seems to reestablish the 
normal regulation of cell proliferation the unregulated division 
of cells is a primary characteristic of cancer 
researchers at hopkins and at case western reserve university in 
cleveland also put the p53 into benign colon tumors and found that 
these tumors which have the gene were not affected the 
researchers additionally put a mutated p53 gene into colonies of 
colon cancer cells and found that the abnormal gene did not 
suppress the cell growth 
these experiments said baker verified that the action of the 
normal gene prevented the cancer from growing 
zbar and macdonald said that p53 is missing or mutated in a 
several types of cancer including brain bone breast and adrenal 
carcinoma and that the hopkins study may also apply to those 
cancers 
other researchers also working with laboratory cultures proved 
earlier that restoring other suppressor genes can block growth of 
cancers of the eye and of the kidney but the hopkins study is the 
first to demonstrate the effect of a suppressor gene on one of the 
major cancer killers 
colon cancer which kills about 60000 people annually in the 
united states is second in mortality to lung cancer 
baker cautioned that despite the success of the laboratory 
experiment it does not prove that colon cancer can be treated by 
inserting a normal gene into a patient this may never be possible 
a hopkins statement said 
but baker said that if the action of the suppressor gene can be 
understood then researchers could develop an agent such as a 
protein that mimics the work of p53 and stops cancer growth baker 
said the hopkins team is now studying the mechanism of the 
suppressor gene 
coauthors of the study with baker were eric r fearon and bert 
vogelstein of hopkins and sanford markowitz and james k v 
willson of case western reserve 
science which published the study is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

two scientific reports this week conclude that 
cows treated with an experimental synthetic hormone yield higher 
volumes of milk that is as safe as ordinary milk 
but food and drug administration officials say it will take at 
least until next spring to determine if the treatment is safe for 
the cows and critics remain unconvinced the geneticallyengineered 
hormone is safe at all 
if the fda approves the hormone bovine somatotropin or bst it 
would become the first biotechnology product on the agriculture 
market 
there are a lot of unanswered questions jeremy rifkin 
president of the foundation on economic trends and a biotechnology 
critic said thursday the public deserves to have a thorough 
study of all this and not a rush to judgment and thats what the 
fda is trying to do 
fda scientists in an article in this weeks edition of the 
journal science laid out the evidence it believes shows that milk 
and meat from dairy cows treated with the hormone are safe for 
human consumption 
rifkin criticized the fda for using old studies that tested with 
natural bst rather than the synthetic hormone 
the fdas submission of the report to the journal for review by 
an expert panel of scientists was unusual since the agency as a 
rule does not tip its hand publicly on products before they are 
approved 
the fdas action was a response to congressional and public 
interest over the safety of bst said fda spokesman jeff nesbit 
some consumer activists say longterm effects of the bst are 
still not known and farmers worry that consumers might shy away 
from products from treated cows 
farmers also are concerned that increased milk production would 
lower prices 
but nesbit said whether bst will hurt small farmers does 
not fall within the fdas regulatory scope we only look at the 
safety and efficacy of a drug not the economics of it 
earlier this week the journal of the american medical 
association published the work of two researchers who concluded 
that bst can boost milk production in dairy cows by 10 percent to 
25 percent while causing no significant changes in composition of 
the milk 
rifkin said that report was shameful because the authors are 
consultants to monsanto agriculture co one of the companies 
making bst 
jama also published an editorial by an independent researcher 
backing the conclusions 
besides monsanto the fda has allowed three other companies 
eli lilly co upjohn co and american cyanamid to conduct 
limited farm tests of their products and to sell the milk from the 
test cows

a stagnating us economy that has survived 
many close calls to expand for a peacetime record of nearly eight 
years may receive its crippling blow from the middle east analysts 
fear 
regardless of whether regional hostilities escalate many 
analysts predict an economic downturn is imminent because of the 
runup in oil prices that has already occurred since iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
more information on the economy will be known today when the 
government releases a revised look at the broadest measure of 
economic health the gross national product 
a month ago the commerce department said the gnp grew at a 
lackluster annual rate of just 12 percent in the apriljune 
quarter in advance of todays report many analysts believe that 
estimate would be revised upward but only slightly to perhaps 14 
percent based on a modest improvement in the countrys trade 
performance 
however analysts said an upward revision would not change their 
basic feeling that the us economy has ground to a near standstill 
and could well topple into a recession before the year is out 
recession fears and the threeweekold persian gulf crisis have 
rattled financial markets worldwide the dow jones industrial 
average plunged by 7673 points on thursday to 248342 and has 
lost 17 percent of its valued since the market peaked at an 
alltime high just below the 3000 mark on july 17 
the price of crude oil which has jumped by nearly 50 percent 
since aug 2 rose 71 cents to close at 3193 on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
even the administration while insisting that a recession can 
still be avoided is predicting that economic growth could be 
trimmed in half by the rise in oil prices 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said that the gnp which 
averaged 15 percent through the first six months of this year may 
grow at a barely perceptible 075 percent in the last six months 
private forecasters however are far more pessimistic 
predicting that an outright recession normally defined as two 
consecutive quarters of negative growth will begin perhaps by the 
final three months of this year 
the longer the crisis in the middle east lasts the more 
inevitable a downturn becomes said david wyss an economist with 
drimcgraw hill a lexington mass forecasting firm 
rising oil prices will only exacerbate an already gloomy 
inflation outlook in the united states and keep the federal reserve 
from administering its normal antiinflation medicine a dose of 
lower interest rates many analysts believe 
the latest survey of 49 top economists taken this month after 
the iraqi invasion showed them slashing their gnp forecast for 
this year to 13 percent down from a 19 percent gnp estimate the 
month before it marked the second largest onemonth drop in 
economic expectations in the 13year history of the survey by blue 
chip economic indicators a monthly newsletter 
editor rj eggert told subscribers its safe to conclude 
that the united states now faces the greatest risk of recession in 
the last eight years 
the current recovery from the 198182 recession is nearing its 
eighth birthday only the almost nineyear expansion during the 
1960s which occurred during the vietnam war lasted for a longer 
period

the justice departments antitrust division is 
taking a crash course in the petroleum industry and its tutors 
oil companies summoned for meetings in the capital may end up 
targets of prosecution 
the antitrust division is trying to uncover whether illegal 
tactics were used when the price of oil leaped following iraqs 
invasion of kuwait 
as a first step in its investigation the division is learning 
the intricacies of how the industry works from the people who live 
it daily the oil companies 
i have called the major oil companies and requested that they 
come in on a onebyone basis to meet with the staff and on several 
occasions with me assistant attorney general james rill who 
heads the division told reporters thursday 
already representatives of three major oil companies and two 
independent marketers have met with some of the 10 antitrust 
officials working on the inquiry rill said declining to identify 
the companies 
the need for the background briefing is the complexity of the 
situation he said 
were dealing with an entire industry multiple levels of 
distribution a worldwide situation rill said it seemed to me 
prudent to get a very quick process going to attempt to get the 
scope of the issue the dynamics of the industry in hand before we 
went to the kind of focused inquiry which may be the next phase 
the company representatives top level people in these 
companies are explaining the industrys price practices the 
circumstances of the sharp increases in detail and the reasons why 
those increases have occurred rill said 
the average price of gasoline at the pump has jumped some 18 
percent since iraq overran kuwait on aug 2 american automobile 
association surveys report the average pump price of unleaded 
regular gasoline increased from 105 a gallon on july 25 to 124 
a gallon on monday the aaa found 
prosecutors are looking for suggestions of collusion unlawful 
contacts or contacts suggesting anticompetitive activity and 
pricing and supply behavior that may not be fully explained by 
market forces rill said 
the inquirys general factfinding phase should be completed 
within the next four weeks and should direct prosecutors to the 
most promising lines of inquiry to pursue he said 
the companies have been forthcoming with information even 
though they know prosecutions may occur later rill said they have 
been promised confidentiality he said but he would not say 
whether they had been offered any kind of immunity from prosecution 
or other incentives to reveal information 
thus far no subpoenas have been issued to compel cooperation 
but rill said if any companies refuse to cooperate well know 
how to deal with them 
rill had announced aug 6 that he was beginning such an inquiry 
that announcement he said thursday was inspired both to alert the 
industry that we were on the job and looking for evidence of 
illegal conduct and to encourage any potential whistleblowers to 
come forth with information

iraqi president saddam hussein is 
repositioning his elite republican guards which led the attack 
into kuwait behind other troops on the front lines according to 
an intelligence source 
theyre withdrawing the republican guard to positions behind 
the front lines said the source who has access to intelligence 
information and spoke thursday on condition of anonymity 
the source said the specialized troops were being positioned 
behind another line of iraqi troops but still would be capable of 
contributing to a possible attack of saudi arabia from kuwait 
you put your forces in front of you to screen them and then 
you make your attack through them theres no indication hes 
withdrawing at all hes adding to his forces the source said 
the key is the positioning of artillery the source said 
artillery has a limited range if you are in a defensive 
position you move it backward so you can withdraw under the 
protection of your artillery when you attack you move it forward 
to attack under its protection the source said his saddams 
artillery is still forward 
nbc news reported thursday that intelligence reports showed that 
thousands of the guards perhaps more than 50000 were heading 
away from the saudi border 
the intelligence source said saddams troops were involved in a 
classically soviet military maneuver and that they retained the 
ability to attack on short notice within eight to 12 hours 
us intelligence has various means of detecting in great detail 
the movements of iraqi troops but the source refused to discuss 
how such information is obtained it is well known that the united 
states makes extensive use of satellite reconnaissance however 
there still appear to be about 160000 iraqi troops inside 
kuwait the source said adding that there appeared to be more 
divisions moving into southern iraq 
american military officials assume that saddams heavily 
mechanized forces could make a drive across the border and 
simultaneously use air power in such an attack 
intelligence reports have indicated that the iraqi army has 
stores of food ammunition supplies and artillery in positions 
that could be used to launch an attack into saudi arabia 
the source described the situation as still being ambiguous 
and that it was not clear what saddam intended to do 
the source said saddams troops had thrown up what is known as a 
hasty defense troops didnt mount a defense in depth a kind 
of layer cake defense that would create severe difficulties for 
an attacking opponent the source said

federal courts may open their doors just a 
crack to radio television and photographic coverage 
a fivejudge committee of the policymaking us judicial 
conference will recommend an experiment in lifting the longtime ban 
on such coverage when it meets next month conference spokesman 
david sellers said thursday 
what the fivejudge committee will recommend is a threeyear 
experiment sellers said the conference could accept amend 
reject or merely table the recommendation 
the experiment if approved would be limited to two federal 
appeals courts and six federal trial courts the committee headed 
by us district judge robert peckham of san francisco is not 
recommending which courts be selected for the experiment 
civil but not criminal proceedings could be open to tv 
cameras and other coverage now barred by federal court rules 
sellers said 
judges would have broad discretion to bar such coverage in any 
particular case he said 
sellers said the committees recommendation would entail no 
government expense any expense would be borne by the news 
media he said 
peckhams committee is recommending that the experiment begin in 
july 1991 
the judicial conference is composed of 27 federal judges and is 
headed by chief justice william h rehnquist the conference has 
been asked repeatedly in recent years by news media representatives 
to open federal courts to tv radio and photographic coverage 
peckhams committee told the conference last year that it lacked 
sufficient information to make any recommendation for changing the 
longtime ban 
most state courts allow some type of electronic or photographic 
coverage of civil and criminal proceedings

the proctorsilex co is setting aside 
several million dollars to provide free coffee makers to an 
estimated 800000 consumers who purchased a model mow declared a 
fire hazard company officials say 
arnold dreyfus the corporations chairman declined to say 
thursday exactly how much the recall would cost remarking only 
that it would depend on how many recalled coffee makers are turned 
in 
commenting in a telephone interview from proctorsilex 
headquarters in richmond va dreyfus said the recalled models 
were made in 1985 and 1986 and have since been discontinued 
this problem did not manifest itself until much later he 
said 
proctorsilex says it believes the recalled coffee makers are 
subject to potentially dangerous overheating because their 
thermostats and thermal fuses may malfunction 
dreyfus said the company is trying to identify the vendors that 
provided the allegedly bad fuses 
the company said more than 200 telephone operators are fielding 
calls about proctorsilex automatic drip coffee makers and issuing 
instructions on how to turn in recalled models and receive a free 
appliance 
company officials acknowledged that the initial volume has been 
so heavy that many consumers get repeated busy signals 
the tollfree number set up by the company is 18003413333

tests show that airlines could save hundreds 
of millions of dollars in fuel costs with a new wing design that 
reduces drag from air flowing over a passenger jetliners wings 
nasa says 
a joint governmentindustry flight test program produced results 
that were much better than expected officials of the national 
aeronautics and space administration said thursday 
the tests were conducted for five months on a boeing 757 on 
which a 22foot wing section had been replaced by a wing surface 
designed to produce a smooth air flow the space agency said if 
the modification had been made along the entire wingspan on both 
sides drag would have been reduced by 10 percent the space agency 
said 
each percent of drag eliminated by the us transport fleet 
would result in an annual fuel savings of 100 million for the 
industry nasa said 
the modified wing section includes millions of tiny 
laserdrilled holes in a titanium skin covered by a flap along the 
leading edge to shield against insects and dirt during takeoffs and 
landings 
the holes create a suction effect that diverts turbulent air 
from the surface of the wing and allows a smoother air flow 
the design resulted from earlier flow tests on military jets 
nasa said a future flight test is being considered that will use 
the system on other wing sections 
the testing is jointly funded by the government and boeing 
commercial airplane group which builds boeing jetliners

an investigative reporter angered by the new 
york times review of his book on the alleged links between 
organized crime and the national football league has filed a 10 
million libel lawsuit against the paper 
dan e moldea filed suit thursday in us district court in 
washington over the newspapers sept 3 1989 review of his book 
interference how organized crime influences professional 
football 
the new york timess top attorney expressed confidence that the 
suit would be thrown out of court and said the review was based 
on accurate facts 
the review by times sportswriter gerald eskenazi said in part 
that moldeas book contains sloppy journalism as well as 
errors and unfounded insinuations 
the lawsuit alleges that the review was intended to protect 
the nfl by personally attacking moldea discrediting his reputation 
and smearing his good name as a careful investigative reporter 
the review gave false impressions through use of false and 
misleading examples intended to injure moldeas reputation impeach 
moldeas honesty and integrity and destroyed the likelihood that 
interference would become a widely read book by the public the 
suit says 
moldea said in an interview that his publisher william morrow 
and co inc had printed 33000 copies of the book because initial 
sales had been strong but after the new york times review came 
out sales dropped off precipitously and only about 21000 were 
sold 
this thing could have been stopped so long ago had they just 
published a correction or my letter that countered point by 
point statements in the review moldea said 
eskenazi declined comment on the matter referring questions to 
times executives even though this is something im appalled at 
when people do it to me

stories 
voros who spent the last four years documenting the destruction 
of the last virgin rain forest in west africa had his work looted 
he also saw a friend tortured by soldiers who later told him his 
friend had been killed and he has memories of bodies littering 
streets in liberias capital monrovia 
the 33yearold new jersey man was jailed for eight days in 
monrovia by soldiers loyal to president samuel doe the us 
embassy engineered voros release us marines got him out of the 
country saturday and he returned tuesday to his home in rahway 10 
miles southwest of newark 
since i was released ive kept the loss of my friends and 
work out of my mind he said thursday by telephone from his 
homeim so happy to be alive 
the eightmonthold rebellion to oust doe reached monrovia in 
june since then the city has been battered by rockets and 
mortars bodies litter the streets and beleaguered residents have 
gone without fresh food supplies water and electricity 
at least 5000 people have been killed most of them civilians 
frontend loaders regularly drove through town with their 
buckets loaded with corpses voros recalled 
there were people eating dogs and dogs eating people in the 
street he said 
a month ago he helped care for survivors of an army massacre of 
hundreds of refugees in a lutheran church it was horrifying 
there were children with feet and hands blown off women with legs 
ripped open and breasts blown off he said 
voros said he survived prison because of the deference africans 
show to white americans i got to wear my jeans during the day 
everyone else was stripped he said 
soldiers would accuse him of being a cia agent at one point and 
then ask for his help in getting a visa to the united states you 
dont know how many soldiers took my us address down he said 
voros and his close friend col christopher doe a former 
finance director for the army who is not related to the president 
were arrested at voros house by soldiers who accused them of 
supporting the rebels 
on the fourth day of their imprisonment christie was brought 
in stripped and beaten with a cartridge belt in front of me 
voros said the next day a soldier told voros his friend had been 
killed 
the house was looted of all valuables he said everything i 
worked for four years was in my house he said 
a biology graduate voros worked in yosemite national park and 
spent two years in liberia with the peace corps until 1984 he 
returned 1 years later primarily to document the destruction of 
the countrys virgin rain forest which he said is the last one 
remaining in west africa 
voros also videotaped secret tribal societies and scenes of 
urban life in monrovia took shots of elephants and monkeys and 
interviewed elderly liberians about their homeland freed american 
slaves founded liberia in 1822 
he had accumulated 50000 in grants from us government 
agencies for his rain forest project and worries hell have to pay 
it back because he has nothing to show for it 
over half of the rain forest has been destroyed by logging 
companies that bribe government officials to get into the forests 
towering hardwoods voros said peasants then move into the area 
and create farmland by slashing and burning the remaining forests 
in 25 to 30 years the rest of the forest will be destroyed 
he said 
if some semblance of peace returns voros said hed like to 
return 
if the city is not destroyed completely id like to go back 
and post rewards for the return of my videos he said

the us and soviet ambassadors have 
disagreed over whether the five permanent members of the security 
council back a resolution allowing military force to put teeth in 
the un embargo against iraq 
after a private meeting thursday at the french mission with the 
ambassadors of the soviet union britain china and france 
thursday us ambassador thomas r pickering told reporters we 
agreed on a text to send to capitals 
he said there would be a vote on the resolution as soon as it 
can be arranged 
pickerings statement appeared to indicate earlier soviet 
objections to using force to back up the international had been 
overcome objections by moscow have posed the biggest obstacle to 
us efforts on the issue 
but when asked later whether the text was approved soviet 
ambassador valentin v lozinskiy replied its not no no 
thats the wrong impression 
lozinskiy said however there could be a security council 
meeting this week probably 
when asked about a breakthrough lozinsky said hopefully 
hopefully it takes time not today 
president bush has said he wants the security councils blessing 
to use force to halt iraqs shipping but he has also said the 
united states already has the right to enforce the un trade 
sanctions against iraq 
us officials contend the united states is authorized to 
enforce the embargo at the request of the ousted kuwaiti 
government and by the un charter which grants nations the right 
to selfdefense 
soviet objections to wording in a usproposed un resolution 
on military enforcement of sanctions have in the past days been the 
major obstacle to raising the issue 
moscow has said it wanted evidence the un embargo was being 
violated before the security council should authorize force to 
police its sanctions 
it has said it would not participate in an international 
military operation unless it was organized by the united nations 
it also has sought a larger role for the security councils 
military staff committee 
the united states however seeks a loose arrangement in which 
various national navies are free to use their own rules of 
engagement and possibly operate in their own sectors to enforce the 
embargo 
us officials have said they would not call a meeting of the 
full 15member security council unless they have approval of the 
five permanent members or a promise not to veto the us 
initiative 
the economic sanctions were ordered by the united nations on 
aug 6 to punish iraq for its invasion of kuwait four days earlier 
meanwhile a un statement said two top un officials checking 
on foreigners in iraq met nine foreign men held at an undisclosed 
location about one hour from baghdad 
the two un envoys in iraq are undersecretarygeneral virendra 
dayal and personnel director kofi annan they arrived monday with 
instructions from the security council to help ensure the safety 
and secure the release of foreigners being held in iraq and kuwait 
the council has demanded their release 
the envoys have been meeting senior iraqi government officials 
but details of the discussions have not been disclosed the united 
nations is removing about 310 staff and dependents from iraq and 
kuwait

after peaking at midmorning the nikkei fell almost 900 points 
by midafternoon before rising back traders said lastminute 
bargain hunting helped the late recovery 
the index started lower on rapid selling in the wake of the 
previous days plunge but regained nearly 700 points by 
midmorning as market players began buying after an nbc news report 
that iraqi leader saddam hussein had ordered some elite troops 
withdrawn from the kuwaitisaudi arabian border said tomoya koda 
a trader with new japan securities co 
the troops were to be replaced by second and thirdstring 
units the report said 
the market first took the news as a sign that iraq was 
withdrawing from the border because many investors were 
desperately seeking an excuse to buy after thursdays hugo stock exchange 
announced it would tighten regulations effective friday on 
speculative future trading to stop share prices from falling 
further 
also the finance ministry on friday eased restrictions on 
limiting security firms from trading more than 30 percent of the 
total trading volume of one issue per month 
as financial authorities started moving to defend the stock 
market a sense of confidence began to take root among investors 
said akira shimoda an equity analyst with yamaichi securities 
but koda said he saw little hope of market recovery by technical 
measures since psychological factors are having more impact on the 
market movements

engineers performed a partial memory 
transplant on one of magellans computers as they tried to make 
sure they dont lose touch with the unruly space probe for a third 
time as it orbits venus 
engineers havent pinpointed the problem that made them 
temporarily lose contact with magellan twice during the past week 
they replaced the faulty computer memory because were fixing the 
symptoms ed sherry technical assistant to magellans project 
manager said thursday 
scientists at nasas jet propulsion laboratory today planned to 
release more of magellans early pictures of venus made during a 
test just before the first communications breakdown aug 16 
the national aeronautic and space administration released 
magellans first venus images tuesday only hours before losing 
radio contact with the wayward spacecraft the second time 
the first batch of test pictures showed numerous venusquake 
faults old lava flows craters cinder cones valleys and ridges 
on venus that means at least part of venus is shaped by some of 
the same violent forces that sculpted earth 
a laboratory official said thursday that one of the pictures 
being released today showed an interesting crater on the planets 
surface 
earlier this week magellans chief scientist steve saunders 
said that unreleased magellan pictures showed a 20milewide crater 
that also had been seen by the soviet venera 15 and 16 spacecraft 
in the mid1980s 
the soviet pictures were about 10 times less detailed than 
magellans radar images so it wasnt clear if the crater was 
volcanic or caused by a meteorite impact 
magellans pictures clearly show it is an impact crater but the 
floor of the crater is extremely smooth indicating it was flooded 
by lava that later solidified saunders said 
he said the crater may have filled with lava from an eruption 
triggered when a meteorite punched completely through venus crust 
or the lava simply may have filled the crater much later in an 
eruption unrelated to the impact 
magellan is on a 744 million mission to use its radar to peer 
through the clouds of venus and make the most detailed pictures and 
maps yet of the second planet from the sun it went into orbit 
around venus on aug 10 about 15 months after it was launched from 
the shuttle atlantis it now is nearly 150 million miles from earth 
sherry said engineers dont yet know how long magellans 
troubles will delay the official start of its mapping effort which 
was to begin the first week of september 
the ultimate problem that caused the malfunction remains 
unknown but flight data show that tuesday night the spacecrafts 
automatic safety systems were unable to maintain radio contact as 
expected because part of the memory was corrupted in a backup 
computer that helps point magellan sherry said he said engineers 
replaced the faulty contents of that computers memory with a 
rewritten version that was radioed to the spacecraft thursday 
magellans main computer found something was not kosher in 
the backup computers memory and as a result assumed magellan was 
pointing in the wrong direction which it wasnt sherry said 
that made magellan try to turn to what it thought was the correct 
position but it actually turned its antenna away from earth 
losing contact 
the series of malfunctions have shaken the spacecraft but the 
overall spacecraft remains very healthy and were very optimistic 
well be back to a fruitful mission soon sherry said

more cracks have appeared in the soviet union 
with armenia declaring independence turkmenia announcing its 
sovereignty and estonia beginning talks toward separation 
however struggling to keep the nation whole and the economy 
afloat president mikhail s gorbachev on thursday managed to 
neutralize the russian republics attempt to take control of its 
own vast natural resources 
also thursday heavily armed kgb border troops rolled tanks up 
to the polishlithuanian border to prevent unauthorized crossings 
on the 51st anniversary of the pact that allowed stalin to seize 
the baltic republics 
armenia a republic of 33 million people on the border with 
turkey and iran is the fifth of the soviet unions 15 republics to 
move toward complete independence from the soviet union 
armenias independence resolution declares the beginning of 
the process of establishing independent statehood according to 
an english translation sent to the associated press 
armenian legislator samvel shakhmuradyan said he expects the 
republic to remain part of the soviet union only during an 
undefined transition period to complete separation 
armenias path to independece however might be complicated by 
the bloody twoyear conflict with neighboring azerbaijan over the 
disputed territory of nagornokarabakh 
the declaration calls for creation of armenias own armed forces 
to safeguard the border and for nagornokarabakh a largely 
armenian area of azerbaijan to become part of the armenian 
republic 
the move threatened gorbachevs struggles to develop a new union 
treaty attractive enough to keep his nation whole gorbachev 
however seems to be bowing to baltic demands for complete 
independence 
kremlin officials began formal negotiations with estonia on 
thursday the two other baltics latvia and lithuania were 
expected to begin independence negotiations soon georgia has also 
requested talks with the kremlin on independence 
the estonian and soviet delegations plan to meet weekly for two 
months and present a final document to gorbachevs presidential 
council by the end of october reported the official soviet news 
agency tass 
seven republics have declared sovereignty or the right to 
overturn soviet laws on their territory the republic of turkmenia 
passed such a declaration thursday joining russia the largest 
soviet republic the ukraine azerbaijan byelorussia moldavia 
and uzbekistan 
the armenian resolution was approved by a vote of 1832 
armenian legislator samvel shakhmuradyan said in a telephone 
interview from yerevan the capital of the small republic 
it invalidates the soviet constitution on armenian territory and 
says that only the republics constitution is in effect and 
demands a share of the soviet national wealth shakhmuradyan said 
the resolution calls for the creation of armenias own currency 
banking system and customs duties and claims armenias right to 
conduct its own foreign policy it also bars other nations troops 
and bases from its territory a clear reference to the soviet armed 
forces 
the declaration changes the name of the armenian soviet 
socialist republic to the republic of armenia 
it says armenia will have a multiparty political system and 
freedom of expression press and religion tass reported 
meanwhile thursday gorbachev issued a presidential decree that 
nullified the russian attempt to wrest control over its natural 
resources but on the same day russia the largest of the 15 
soviet republics backed away from its order earlier this month 
that declared invalid contracts signed by the soviet government 
its action averted or postponed a critical battle between 
the national soviet government and the resourcerich republic over 
both the acquisition of badly needed foreign currency and the 
division of power 
also thursday soviet authorities refused to relinquish control 
of the border station between lithuania and ogrodniki poland and 
reinforced that determination with a heavy show of force 
in lithuania independence activists had hoped to take control 
of the border crossing from soviet authorities in a oneday 
demonstration of their desire to open lithuania to the rest of 
europe 
lithuania and the two other baltic republics latvia and 
estonia were independent between the two world wars but lost that 
independence as a result of the molotovribbentrop nonagression 
pact the soviets signed with nazi germany in 1939 
on a field about a mile inside the border an estimated 30000 
raindrenched lithuanians took part in a roman catholic mass as 
part of the event dubbed one european road

alexander gbayee lets strangers sleep in his 
home buys them food and clothing and bails them out of jail hes 
done that job for free since 1978 when liberia appointed him its 
honorary consul for the midwest 
now 38 years after leaving gbayee plans to resettle in his 
troubled homeland i think i can help more people do more good 
over there he said 
gbayee and other liberian immigrants are organizing an emergency 
relief fund to help civilians trapped by an eightmonthold civil 
war in which more than 5000 people mostly civilians have been 
killed 
its strictly a humanitarian effort gbayee said were 
not going to be helping any faction involved in the fighting its 
the average person the common person whos dying daily and they 
have nothing to do with the government 
gbayee 52 recently returned from a twomonth visit to 
monrovia the liberian capital and said he expects soon to return 
for good 
operating out of a carpet shop on the south side gbayee said he 
has helped many of the estimated 3000 liberians who have moved to 
the midwest 
its an honorary position theres no salary for that i serve 
out of love for my country he said with his departure the 
consulate will close until a successor is appointed he said 
in 1957 gbayee traveled from his small african village of 
dodoken to attend school in chicago he had been studying with 
missionaries from chicagos church of god and christ and to a 
13yearold america seemed almost like heaven 
village elders sold a cow for 24 to help finance the trip he 
said 
gbayee graduated from a private christian school and went on to 
earn a masters degree in education from loyola university 
now he said he uses his experience and education to help 
liberians who sometimes arrive in the united states with no 
arrangements for shelter no warm clothes and little money all 
expenses come out of his own pocket he said 
when africans have gotten in trouble with immigration officials 
and police gbayee said hes traveled as far as texas to vouch for 
them or pay bail 
in 1984 he said 25 liberian students arrived to attend chicago 
state university only to find themselves without room and board 
gbayee and his wife musu took 11 into their fourbedroom 
apartment found homes for the rest and helped many get parttime 
jobs 
i think hes gone beyond the line of duty to help people 
said willie nebo one of the students who spent six months camped 
in gbayees apartment 
he does very well not only for liberians but for other 
africans said nebo who graduated this year from chicago state 
university with an economics degree 
chernoh m sesay chicago states vice president for academic 
affairs said he could just deal with people on an official 
level but he loves people hes one of a kind 
gbayee doesnt mind the lack of payment or gratitude from his 
country 
what i do the good is never lost he said ill get 
greater reward from the creator than human praise

a helicopter gunship strafed and 
killed at least 100 tamil rebels riding bicycles toward jaffna to 
help stave off a government offensive against their stronghold 
military officials said today 
the tamils were among 150 guerrillas who were attacked thursday 
at kopay 5 miles northeast of jaffna according to the officials 
the rebels accused the government of indiscriminate bombing of 
civilians 
jaffna town is the rebels chief stronghold in their 7yearold 
war for an independent state in the north and east of the island 
nation the town lies on a lagoon on the jaffna peninsula at the 
northern tip of this indian ocean island nation 
the only government presence in the town is 250 policemen and 
soldiers trapped in the 17th century jaffna fort since june 11 when 
the tamil tiger guerrillas broke a 13month ceasefire with the 
sinhalesedominated government 
on wednesday the government launched a new offensive and landed 
troops on kayts island which faces the fort across 4 miles of 
water so far the government has said four soldiers were killed 
and 16 wounded by land mines in their push to reach the mainland 
no independent reports have emerged on the fighting in jaffna 
185 miles northeast of colombo communications with the peninsula 
were cut this summer when the latest round of tamilsinhalese 
fighting broke out 
a tiger statement issued in london charged that 
indiscriminate aerial and naval bombardment on heavily populated 
areas in the whole of the jaffna peninsula was claiming many 
civilian lives 
the tigers said manthikai and moolai hospitals in the heart of 
the peninsula were hit the statement gave no casualty figures 
the government says it bombs only identified rebel targets 
it declared an aroundtheclock curfew before launching the 
offensive on tuesday airplanes dropped leaflets warning the 
peninsulas estimated 850000 civilians to stay indoors until 
further notice 
the government has declined to say how many troops have been 
deployed but it said planes and boats landed 5000 men in the 
peninsula in the last three days to join a force moving up the 
isthmus 
since the tamil insurrection began in 1983 both sides have used 
heavy firepower and civilian casualties have been high tamil 
guerrillas have massacred whole villages of sinhalese and moslems 
in northern and eastern sri lanka as well as entire police 
garrisons 
in the early years of the revolt the government responded with 
massive land and air assaults that prompted neighboring india to 
intervene in 1987 the indian peacekeeping force left in march 
after failing to quell the jungle war 
at least 14000 people have been killed in the war that grew out 
of tamil complaints of discrimination by the sinhalese majority 
moslems are caught in the war accused by the tamils of siding with 
the government 
sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the 16 million people of 
sri lanka have dominated the government and military since the 
indian ocean island became independent from britain in 1949 
tamils comprise 18 percent while moslems account for 7 percent

share prices in tokyo rebounded today for the first 
time in seven trading days helped by bargain hunting and a sense 
of confidence resulting from official efforts to save the suffering 
stock market the us dollar fell slightly against the yen 
the 225share nikkei stock average regained 42813 points or 
18 percent ending the day at 2416576 it was the first gain 
since aug 15 and followed two days of steep plunges 
about 550 million shares up from thursdays 450 million traded 
hands in moderate trading on the first section 
the us dollar closed at 14570 yen down 018 yen from 
thursdays finish of 14588 yen the currency opened at 14600 yen 
and ranged between 14567 yen and 14625 yen about 94 billion 
changed hands in spot trading 
the nikkei was swayed throughout the day by reports that iraqi 
troops were withdrawing from kuwait after peaking at midmorning 
the nikkei fell almost 900 points by midafternoon before surging 
back traders said lastminute bargain hunting helped the late 
recovery 
yoshiro inoue an analyst with nomura securities co said a 
sense of confidence resulting from the government effort to save 
the market was gradually taking root among investors and supported 
the market 
their measures are not directly helping the markets recovery 
but their action is at least a big psychological support he said 
following thursdays sharp decline the finance ministry today 
eased restrictions on the amount of shares each security firm can 
trade on each issue 
also the tokyo stock exchange announced it would tighten 
technical regulations beginning today to restrict speculative 
trading 
earlier today market players began buying when they heard a 
news report that iraqi leader saddam hussein had ordered some elite 
troops withdrawn from the kuwaitisaudi arabian border said tomoya 
koda a trader with new japan securities co 
but koda said the index lost its early gains when investors 
started selling because they reinterpreted the move negatively as 
a sign of iraqs preparation in case of a us attack 
meanwhile on the foreign exchange market the dollar weakened 
as a result of technical adjustments with the yen amid continuing 
uncertainties over the gulf crisis said naohiko yasuda a dealer 
with the bank of tokyo 
he said investors tended to buy the yen based on their 
speculation that the bank of japan will have to raise its official 
discount rate to stem growing inflationary pressure resulting from 
soaring oil prices 
north brent crude oil for october delivery was notionally valued 
at 30653075 per barrel at late afternoon the level was lower 
than the 3080 dollarperbarrel level thursday in asia 
oil traders said participants pushed down oil prices by selling 
part of their overbought positions to take profits following a 
dramatic price increase since earlier this week

a finnish company has introduced a 
fiveyear hormonereleasing contraceptive coil that doctors say is 
highly effective 
the intrauterine device called levanovar was put on the finnish 
market by the leiras company on thursday after getting government 
approval 
levanovar releases levonorgestrel a synthetic hormone that 
prevents fertilization said maija haukkamaa chief physician at 
helsinki university hospital 
the coil is inserted for five years at a time then replaced 
unless pregnancy is desired 
the advantage of the hormonereleasing coil is that fertility 
returns quickly after it is removed haukkamaa said in an interview 
the new coil has a factor of 01 percent on the pearl index 
which indicates the likelihood of pregnancy that is the same as 
for sterilization the factor for traditional iud coils is as high 
as 1 percent to 3 percent haukkamaa said 
the hormonereleasing iud contraceptive is not recommended for 
young women or women who have never given birth for such users it 
could cause miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies as other coils 
but otherwise it is much safer and more comfortable said 
haukkamaa 
haukkamaa said she has tested the new iud on thousands of 
finnish women over 10 years with good results it also has been 
clinically tested in 25 countries including in the united states 
professor tapani luukkainen a member of the new yorkbased 
population council said the coil would not have materialized after 
18 years of research without support of the international council 
they financed the research and we have a duty to try and 
market the coil in the united states but the us markets are very 
problematic luukkainen said 
the coil is expected to sell in other european countries within 
two years and possibly before then in scandinavia 
luukkainen said the new coil at 90 compares favorably in 
price to traditional copper iuds or other forms of contraception 
the tshaped plastic coil has a silicon cylinder which contains 
the contraceptive hormone a thin film regulates the release of the 
hormone 
the levonorgestrel hormone is completely safe and has been 
tested worldwide in countless forms including in contraceptive 
pills for many years luukkainen said 
it stops menstrual bleeding and pain and gives similar 
infectionprotection as oral contraceptives it also can be used as 
a cure for heavy menstrual bleeding luukkainen said 
he added that it therefore could be used as a treatment for 
heavy bleeding and other ailments which often require 
hysterectomies

bush orders the use of us military might in the persian gulf 
crisis a newspaper reported today 
the joint chiefs of staff are urging that any military action 
against iraqi president saddam hussein and his huge warmaking 
capacity be sweeping simultaneous and deadly the los angeles 
times reported today 
we will attempt to be decisive said air force chief of 
staff gen michael j dugan 
dugan and other officials stressed that the us would not take 
military action without provocation 
saddam is holding an estimated 3000 americans and 3000 britons 
hostage in iraq and kuwait and has ordered some of them held at 
potential military targets 
the pentagon is compiling an exhaustive list of iraqi targets 
for us airplanes the times reported the air force has 
dispatched an estimated 250 fighters bombers and fighters and the 
navy has an extra 270 aircraft ready 
those targets could include saddams presidential palace 
military command centers iraqs chemical and nuclear weapons 
complexes ballistic missile sites military airfields oil 
refineries and pipelines water purification plants ports rail 
lines and highways analysts said 
defense secretary dick cheney said thursday the united states 
was organizing a significant military presence in the middle east 
and would respond aggressively if provoked 
if saddam were foolish enough to attack us forces we 
clearly are in a position if the president so decides to respond 
very forcefully against those things he cares about and 
specifically those are his forces and his capabilities inside 
iraq cheney said 
gen colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
delivered an explicit threat to saddam on thursday 
we will defend our interests dont try to scare us or 
threaten us it wont work powell declared in a speech to the 
veterans of foreign wars convention in baltimore

saddam hussein parading some of his 
western captives on tv ruffled the hair of a british child and 
told the uneasy group they are not hostages but peacemakers 
the iraqi president today freed a british teenager traveling 
alone caught in the standoff over iraqs invasion of kuwait 
but saddams tv performance which western governments denounced 
as a sham show of sympathy gave no hope that americans and other 
foreign captives would soon be freed from their role as human 
shields to deter an attack on iraq 
the smiling iraqi who traded his customary military uniform 
for a gray suit for the broadcast thursday told about 20 adults 
and children they were being held to prevent the scourge of war 
you are not hostages here he said calling them guests 
some of the hostages smiled back others appeared wary 
the westerners names werent given but at least two families 
were identified by british relatives 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd called the broadcast 
the most sickening thing ive seen for a long time 
i think the manipulation of children in that way is 
contemptible he said it showed us a man completely 
unscrupulous in his choice of means but i think it also showed us 
that he completely misunderstood the people that he is dealing 
with 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
saddam hussein is obviously more interested in some sort of 
shameful theatrics than in dealing with the two issues that really 
matter and thats withdrawal from kuwait and freedom for innocent 
civilians 
a 45minute tape of the meeting was broadcast on iraqs state 
television showing the hostages taken in the aftermath of iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait it was an apparent attempt to show the 
hostages were not being mistreated 
it wasnt known when the tape was made or where the meeting was 
held 
british airways said 15yearold alex barnett arrived in the 
jordanian capital of amman this morning on an iraqi airways flight 
from baghdad after iraq freed him to leave 
barnett had been traveling alone on a british airways flight 
heading from london to madras india and malaysia that was stranded 
in kuwait city during the aug 2 invasion the airline said 
an airline official said barnett hamilton scotland would be 
put on the first available flight from amman to london 
saddam has said the foreigners including 3000 americans and 
4500 britons will be held until the usled multinational force 
is withdrawn from saudi arabia and an international embargo against 
iraq is lifted 
flanked by army officers and speaking through an interpreter 
the iraqi president said on the tape he ordered the westerners 
interned at potential military targets to deter war 
if the western media and governments chose to describe that as 
using them as a human shield thats their own interpretation he 
said 
saddam 52 made jokes arranged a group photograph and 
attempted to draw a friendly response from some of the children 
shown on the broadcast at one point he ruffled the hair of a boy 
who was standing by his side and the boy appeared to lean away 
saddam asked two boys if they had enough room to play sports 
and if they were getting enough milk and food one said he was 
getting enough milk and corn flakes 
saddam then laughed and turning to one of his officers and 
said he is getting more than our iraqi children i dont think 
iraqi children can get corn flakes 
iraq has warned that if a united nations embargo imposed on iraq 
brings food shortages westerners will suffer first 
saddam asked the foreign captives to forgive him for keeping 
them in iraq 
this does not make us happy what would make us happy would be 
to see you back in your countries or back in baghdad in the 
normal way you used to do he said

opec oil producing nations meeting this 
weekend in vienna will discuss how to respond to the persian gulf 
crisis which has tightened world supplies and sent crude prices 
soaring 
venezuela and oil giant saudi arabia would like opecs approval 
to boost production to help meet the shortfall but the saudis have 
said theyll pump more regardless of what the cartel decides 
an opec source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
cartels president algerian oil minister sadek boussena will be 
in vienna sunday and he will consult with anybody who cares to 
come 
but the informal meeting could turn into an emergency session in 
which decisions could be made said venezuelas energy and mines 
minister celestino armas 
oil ministers from most of the 13 nations making up the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries agreed to attend the 
talks in vienna the cartels headquarters venezuelan president 
carlos andres perez said in caracas 
an opec official said on condition of anonymity this morning 
that ministers from algeria indonesia nigeria iran gabon 
ecuador and venezuela would attend 
fears of military escalation in the mideast and shortages of oil 
on thursday sent futures prices for crude oil up 71 cents to 3193 
a barrel 
perez did not say the meeting would mean increased production to 
make up for the international embargo of kuwait and iraq imposed 
after iraqs aug 2 invasion of its oilrich neighbor 
boosting production to make up for the decline in iraqi and 
kuwaiti shipments which amounts to about 4 million barrels of 
crude oil daily has received insufficient support among opec 
members 
irans official islamic republic news agency quoted oil minister 
gholamreza aqazadeh as saying his trip is a positive response to 
boussenas call for an exchange of views on the current situation 
in the world oil market 
one source said saudi arabia also was likely to attend but 
there was no official confirmation of the report 
indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita was quoted by a 
local newspaper in jakarta as saying neither iraq nor kuwait would 
attend the weekend talks 
boussena made a surprise visit thursday to jiddah saudi arabia 
for talks with hisham nazer the kingdoms oil minister who was 
rebuffed earlier in the week in an attempt to call an emergency 
session of all 13 nations 
nazer along with venezuelas armas had requested the meeting 
to discuss the turbulent situation but opec headquarters issued a 
statement monday saying there was not enough support among the 
others to hold a formal meeting 
nazer said last weekend saudi arabia which produces about a 
quarter of the cartels oil would lift pumping to 2 million 
barrels a day with or without the nod from opec

israel and jordan two small middle eastern 
nations that exist side by side in an uneasy and unofficial state 
of peace are watching iraqi president saddam husseins moves with 
apprehension 
the lightning invasion of kuwait aug 2 reminded the world what 
israelis and jordanians always have known small nations can 
disappear in the twinkling of an eye their survival in the 
volatile region requires skill and considerable luck 
neither enjoys saudi arabias benevolent resources neither can 
depend on others to fight their battles 
as they watch and wait israel is counting on its military might 
and the tactical resourcefulness that sustained it against 
overwhelming odds in the past jordan is depending on iraq being 
engaged elsewhere and on king husseins diplomatic footwork 
neither is looking to the united states to dispatch tens of 
thousands of troops as president bush has done to protect the saudi 
oil fields 
israeli leaders consistently have said they do not want 
americans fighting their wars american weapons have made israel 
the most powerful military state in the area the israelis are 
willing to take it from there 
as for jordan the king also is bolstered by us weapons and 
economic aid if he felt threatened by iraq he would be unlikely to 
call for us troops to defend the country 
inviting american military intervention could provoke saddam 
hussein his far more powerful neighbor and a us official said 
privately probably would be a death sentence for the king 
saddams denunciation of zionists leaves no doubt about his 
attitude toward israel a jewish state has no place in his vision 
of the area 
his approach to jordan is less clear aqaba the kingdoms port 
on the red sea has a strategic attraction there is support for 
saddam hussein among many of the kings subjects and jordan stands 
between iraq and israel 
saddams goal probably is a pliant jordan rather than occupation 
of the country that could give him access to aqaba and use of 
jordanian territory for moslem fundamentalists to antagonize syria 
an old iraqi foe 
king hussein is in a tough spot he has tried not to cross 
either saddam or president bush thats almost impossible in the 
current state of high tensions but the king looking out for no 
1 is trying his best 
on the one hand he gave assurances to bush last week in maine 
that jordan would observe the economic boycott of iraq on the 
other the king said he was not clear about the exact terms of the 
sanctions thereby leaving himself wriggle room 
the king moved on thursday to close jordans border with iraq 
which could make escape from that country and from kuwait more 
difficult for trapped foreign nationals but thousands made it 
over and today jordans interior ministry announced the border 
would remain open 
hussein challenged bushs defense of saudi arabia saying there 
was no evidence iraq was about to launch an attack when the 
president rushed troops and warships to the region 
probably the best insurance the king has taken out is to offer 
himself as the potential mediator between iraq and the united 
states 
the two sides are too far at odds right now to look for a 
negotiated way out of the crisis saddams terms for releasing the 
3000 trapped americans is a us withdrawal from saudi arabia 
but should the iraqi leader find his back against the wall and 
the economic squeeze could accomplish that he might offer enough 
to get negotiations started 
in the meantime israeli leaders have warned iraq not to move 
troops into jordan prime minister yitzhak shamir has said he would 
like to believe that saddam knows that any attempt to harm us 
will cost him and his army dearly

a veteran whose application to join an 
american legion post was rejected last month because he was black 
will be invited to join after all 
and thurman thompson said hell accept 
inviting thompson to join the fred h sexton post 1 in florence 
is just one of the actions that enables the post to resume its 
normal activities after being suspended last week said norris 
kinion state commander for the american legion 
what i would hope is that those who didnt want me they would 
reevaluate their thoughts and situations thompson said thursday 
night i hope that everything ends on a positive note 
according to mintutes of a july meeting members of the post 
said they did not want a black in the allwhite post which has 
more than 200 members 
at the time the post required just two votes to reject an 
applicant but the post changed its bylaws tuesday to call for a 
majority vote on all applications kinion said 
the bylaws now conform with state and national rules kinion 
said 
the other american legion post in florence post 228 has no 
bylaws on race but has only black members 
the suspension of post 1 has not been formally lifted he said 
but theyre being permitted to function until such time as the 
investigative committee can make its report 
al stein commander of the florence post said thursday he would 
like thompson to apply again he had originally proposed thompson 
as a member before other post members voted against it 
thompson is a former navy petty officer and signalman who served 
in vietnam in 1972 and 1973 
the rejection of thompson prompted several members to resign 
and the florence county legislative delegation fired maria lewis 
the countys veterans affairs officer for her role in the incident 
ms lewis was the posts secretary she had been under fire for 
opposing thompsons membership on grounds that bylaws prohibited 
the integration of black and white posts

the inability of authorities to prosecute a 
suburban doctor who helped a woman commit suicide apparently led a 
california man to believe he could help his cancerravaged wife end 
her life in michigan 
but while dr jack kevorkian remains free bertram r harper is 
being held at wayne county jail on charges of murder and conspiracy 
to commit murder 
harper 72 of loomis calif was arrested sunday shortly 
after his wife virginia 69 died in a room at the comfort inn in 
romulus on detroits outskirts court records show their daughter 
shanda mcgrew was present but was not charged 
kevorkian gained attention when he used a suicide device he had 
created to help an alzheimers disease patient end her life june 4 
mrs harper developed breast cancer two years ago and brought 
to michigan a note from a physician indicating she had only two 
weeks to live said derek humphry executive director of the 
hemlock society a nationwide deathondemand organization 
before ingesting sleeping pills and placing a plastic bag over 
her head she wrote a note saying she wished to die in the presence 
of her husband and daughter humphry said a cause of death has yet 
to be determined 
the family flew to michigan on saturday after learning from the 
widely publicized death of janet adkins 54 of portland ore 
that michigan has no specific law against suicide or assisting in 
it humphry said 
kevorkian has not been charged in the death of adkins 54 of 
portland ore the 62yearold retired pathologist used his device 
which released lethal chemicals into her system in his van at a 
county park about 40 miles north of detroit 
as to why one suicide resulted in charges and the other hasnt 
wayne county prosecutor john ohair said youll have to ask 
oakland county prosecutor dick thompson that we felt we had a 
legal and factual basis to charge mr harper 
ohair refused to comment on harpers specific role in his 
wifes death or give details on why he was charged with murder 
thompson said thursday the adkins case remained under criminal 
investigation 
we are waiting for the results of toxicology tests on mrs 
adkins body thompson said when we get those test results we 
will make a determination whether what he did was a crime 
humphry said the harpers did not attempt to contact kevorkian 
who has been barred by court order from further use of his device 
harper called police shortly after his wife died humphry said 
the charges against harper are each punishable by up to life 
imprisonment district court administrator nancy schuette said 
harper was held on 25000 bond pending a preliminary hearing aug 
29 she said 
humphry said his eugene orebased society will help find a 
lawyer for harper and if necessary pay for it the harpers joined 
the group in 1988 but did not consult with it before traveling to 
michigan humphry said 
they went to michigan thinking theyd be free of 
prosecution humphry said i think its a major reaction 
against dr kevorkian they cant charge dr kevorkian with 
anything this looks as though its a kneejerk reaction 
under california law assisting in suicide is a crime punishable 
by up to five years in prison humphry said

the air force said today it has activated six 
reserve units to supplement its air transport operation for the 
us military buildup in the persian gulf area 
the callup of air national guard and air force reserve units 
from six states marks the start of a national mobilization of 
reserves that president bush authorized on wednesday the 
mobilization is expected to continue at least until oct 1 
army navy and coast guard reserve forces also are scheduled to 
be activated 
the calls are going out said air force maj doug hart a 
defense department spokesman 
hart also disclosed that about 14000 members of the army and 
air force reserve forces already have voluntarily gone on active 
duty 
the six units announced by the air force are 
183rd military airlift squadron air national guard from 
jackson miss flying c141b starlifter transport planes 
137th military airlift squadron air national guard from 
stewart ny flying c5a galaxies 
136th mobile aerial port squadron air national guard from 
dallas texas to provide an airlift terminal and cargo managers 
732nd military airlift squadron air force reserve from mcguire 
air force base nj flying c141b starlifters 
756th military airlift squadron air force reserve from andrews 
air force base md flying c141b starlifters 
337th military airlift squadron air force reserve from 
westover air force base mass flying c5a galaxies 
the pentagon announced on thursday that about 46700 reserves 
will be called to active duty over the next five weeks for 
operation desert shield and that most of the parttime soldiers 
will be posted in or near saudi arabia 
most reserves sent to help defend saudi arabia against a 
possible iraqi attack wont be driving tanks or digging foxholes 
but they will tackle two of the most important tasks in desert 
warfare getting water and protecting against chemical attacks 
its unclear whether any reserve combat units such as the 
georgia national guard unit that comprises one of three brigades in 
the 24th mechanized infantry division at fort stewart ga will be 
dispatched to the forbidding saudi desert the two activeduty 
brigades in the 24th already are on their way there 
pete williams the pentagon press secretary said most of the 
army and air force reserve forces called to active duty will be 
deployed to saudi arabia of the navy reserves who are activated 
about half will be sent there he said 
many of the militarys key skills are held mainly by reserve 
units among those considered most important for desert shield are 
water distribution and purification specialists and experts in 
chemical decontamination officials said 
van d hipp jr deputy assistant secretary of the army for 
reserve forces and mobilization said in an interview that 100 
percent of the armys water purification and distribution manpower 
is in the reserves 
in the saudi desert where temperatures in summer often top 120 
degrees american gis are drinking as much as six gallons of water 
a day to avoid dehydration water also is needed for cooking 
washing and other vital functions 
also 65 percent of the armys chemical decontamination manpower 
is in the reserves hipp said the prospect of iraqi president 
saddam hussein ordering a poison gas attack on us forces is one 
of the biggest concerns of troops hunkering down in the desert 
doctors nurses and other medical personnel also are largely in 
the reserves 
williams said thursday that about 9800 parttime soldiers will 
have been called to leave their civilian jobs by the end of august 
the total is expected to reach about 46700 by oct 1 and williams 
said he could not rule out the possibility of more reserves being 
activated later 
president bush has the authority to call up as many as 200000 
reserves for up to 180 days without declaring a national emergency 
defense secretary dick cheney approved the services requests 
for reserve callups and also authorized them to force an 
unspecified number of activeduty soldiers sailors and airmen 
already in the middle east to put off plans to retire or quit 
the callup of reserves authorized by bush on wednesday is the 
first since the vietnam war 
under an order signed by cheney as many as 49703 army air 
force navy marine corps and coast guard reserves could be 
activated by oct 1 but williams said the marine corps was not 
planning to use the 3000 reserves it is allowed to call 
those called to active duty will serve 90day tours but the 
period could be extended another 90 days if cheney decides that is 
necessary williams said 
williams gave the following breakdown of expected reserve 
callups by service 
army 24734 by oct 1 to fill immediate needs 4912 of the 
total will be called by aug 31 
air force 14476 of which 1002 will be called by the end of 
the month 
navy 6243 with 3030 activated by aug 31 
coast guard 1200 including 700 by the end of the month 
williams said the numbers represent what each service believes 
it will need to supplement its active duty force and that cheney 
approved the figures as upper limits the actual number called up 
could be slightly less williams said 
we will call up only what we need and only when we need it 
williams said

the government imposed a state 
of emergency today in black townships hit by savage tribal fighting 
that has cost more than 500 lives and said troops and police would 
be poured into the areas 
law and order minister adriaan vlok declared black townships 
around johannesburg unrest areas the action gives police 
widespread powers under the internal security laws to detain people 
and to take action to suppress demonstrations and violence 
it is in the interest of south africa and all its inhabitants 
that further bloodshed disorder and chaos be prevented at all 
costs vlok said in a statement issued in pretoria 
the government action came as riot police strung razor wire and 
fired shotguns and tear gas today to keep warring zulus and xhosas 
apart as military reservists were called up to help stop the 
fighting 
vlok also ordered that people in the unrest areas would not be 
allowed to carry a wide range of weapons at public meetings the 
banned weapons included firearms spears battle axes pitchforks 
knives and machetes 
he said the emergency declaration in each area would last up to 
three months the minister also promised that police and army units 
in the areas would be drastically increased but gave no 
details 
the declaration gives police authority to take almost any steps 
they regard as necessary to maintain order in affected areas but 
vlok told journalists the measure would not include bans on 
reporting in the areas 
a nationwide state of emergency imposed in 1985 had restricted 
reporting on unrest the government lifted the emergency on june 8 
in all areas except for natal province where black factional 
fighting has killed thousands 
the african national congress had demanded lifting of the 
nationwide state of emergency as a condition of formal talks with 
the whiteled government on a new constitution 
anc officials had no immediate response to vloks statement 
police strung razor wire today around zulu hostels in kagiso 
township west of johannesburg to keep hundreds of heavilyarmed 
zulus from fighting local xhosa residents riot squads demolished 
barricades put up by residents in the town where four people were 
killed thursday 
residents were demanding zulus be driven out of the migrant 
worker hostels 
kill them thats the only way an eye for an eye they must 
go back to zululand said one angry woman 
police also clashed today in vosloorus township east of

alarming increases in the occurrence of certain 
cancers in the elderly could be the result of increasing exposure 
to industrial carcinogens researchers said friday 
in a report in the british journal the lancet researchers from 
the united states europe and asia concluded that brain and other 
nervous system cancer had roughly doubled in people aged 6584 from 
1968 to 1987 
breast cancer kidney cancer nonhodgkin lymphoma myeloma and 
melanoma have also increased in people 55 or older the researchers 
said 
these patterns have previously been reported in the united 
states but this study finds the same trends in selected countries 
in europe and asia said the researchers led by devra lee davis of 
the national academy of sciences in washington dc 
they speculated that changes in exposure to carcinogens in the 
environment could be one explanation 
older people have had greater exposure to industrial 
carcinogens including badly regulated exposure to newly introduced 
household pesticides and chemicals in the 1940s and 1950s the 
researchers said 
the elderly have also experienced greater exposure to 
carcinogens in the workplace because they have worked longer and 
worked at a time when there were fewer environmental controls on 
such carcinogens the researchers said 
exposure to other illnesses such as influenza during the large 
epidemic in 1918 might also have helped predispose older people to 
cancer 
the findings summarized in the article in the lancet are the 
outgrowth of a workshop held in october 1989

a court has ruled that journalists must 
give unpublished photographs and notes to people involved in 
lawsuits over fires and other public events 
the 21 ruling released thursday by the michigan court of 
appeals was the first time a michigan court considered the issue 
the obligation of all persons to give evidence necessary for 
the proper administration of justice is a fundamental civic duty 
applicable to both criminal and civil cases the ruling said 
the decision involved the ann arbor news a member of booth 
newspapers inc which appealed a washtenaw county circuit court 
order that it turn over unpublished photographs of a fire scene 
no decision has been made on appealing to the michigan supreme 
court said timothy white the papers publisher clearly its 
not favorable to us and we were very confident of winning on 
appeal 
a michigan state university associate professor of journalism 
said the ruling is similar to those in other states which lack 
broad press shield laws 
todd simon who is coauthor of mass communication law 
said they treat the photographer or reporter observing something 
as no different from any other witness 
the photographs taken of a jan 4 1986 fire at mark video 
enterprises inc were sought by american employers insurance for 
use in a civil lawsuit brought by business owner george j marketos 
after the company rejected his claim the company claimed arson was 
involved in the 13 million fire 
the news turned over its 20 unpublished photographs after the 
appeals court agreed to decide the broader issue the pictures were 
not used in the trial 
a majority of the court said no privilege exists under the first 
amendment the michigan constitution or the michigan press shield 
law the shield law protects journalists from disclosing before 
grand juries confidential information from informants 
the court rejected the newspapers arguments that it would be 
too much trouble to produce photographs and material for anyone who 
wanted to use them in a lawsuit 
the news previously provided photographs for anyone who 
requested them at the price of 5 the ruling said 
the newspaper could seek a court order to protect it from 
requests that were harassment oppressive or unduly expensive the 
ruling said 
in a dissent judge john h shepherd said reporters should be 
protected unless their information is essential to the civil case 
and unobtainable elsewhere 
allyn kantor attorney for american employers did not return a 
telephone call seeking comment

thousands of students battled police and 
hijacked buses today during protests against a government plan to 
reserve jobs for lowcaste hindus 
the students tried to storm parliament and hurled rocks at 
police and government buildings police responded with tear gas and 
tossed some of the rocks back at the demonstrators 
the daylong protest brought traffic and business to a halt in 
many districts of the capital city of 8 million people 
police and paramilitary troops went on alert after students 
surged into streets stopping traffic and urging motorists to join 
their campaign the students commandeered dozens of city buses and 
drove them to parliament 
they tried to storm the massive circular building but police 
beat them back with steeltipped bamboo poles 
the police set up rope and metal barricades and fired repeated 
rounds of tear gas when the students tried to form a human chain 
around the parliament building in downtown new delhi 
we dont want the politicians to come out of the parliament 
let them perish there said vinod kumar bist a firstyear 
university student 
angry students attacked policemen with rocks and tree branches 
some hurled empty soft drink bottles 
at least 75 students were arrested assistant police 
commissioner rk neogi said he did not say if they would be 
charged or how long they would be held neogi said the students 
damaged at least 50 buses 
protests started three weeks ago and have spread to six states 
one of the first flashpoints was bihar indias poorest state 
where at least three people have died 
the trouble began when prime minister vp singh announced that 
the government would reserve an additional 27 percent of public 
sector jobs for special categories of lowcaste hindus 
some lower castes and tribes already are protected by quotas 
the latest plan would bring reserved jobs to 49 percent leaving 51 
percent of government jobs awarded on merit 
singh said disadvantaged communities comprise 52 percent of 
indias 880 million people but have only 125 percent of government 
jobs 
his plan angered students from higher castes who called it 
reverse discrimination that would hurt their chances of finding 
work after graduation government jobs are prized because they 
provide security and benefits such as free housing 
hindus have a complex social system with hundreds of castes and 
subcastes that divide them into a rigid hierarchy highcaste 
hindus usually are better off economically 
discrimination on the basis of caste is banned by law but the 
system still permeates indian society especially in rural areas 
successive governments have tried to discard the caste system 
but caste practices have persisted in this nation which is 85 
percent hindu

a biotechnology watchdog who blames the deaths 
of 27 americans directly on gene splicing asked the food and drug 
administration today to stop approving genetically engineered 
products 
this is the first case on record directly connecting the 
recombinant dna process to the death and injury of human beings 
jeremy rifkin said thursday 
the 27 americans died after taking ltryptophan which is sold 
in health food stores as a remedy for insomnia appetite control 
and depression they were among 1500 americans who developed an 
unusual blood disorder called eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome or ems 
it is characterized by muscle and joint pain breathing 
difficulties swelling and rashes the fda ordered all ltryptophan 
off the market in march after the substance was implicated as the 
illnesss cause 
in a report in the aug 9 new england journal of medicine 
doctors in the minnesota department of public health linked the 
deaths to a single manufacturers use of a new strain of 
genetically altered bacteria or the makers reliance on less carbon 
to filter out impurities 
rifkin said that study and another unpublished study link the 
deaths directly to the genetic engineering process 
the president of the washingtonbased foundation on economic 
trends he has been a persistent critic of biotechnology calling 
for more stringent regulation and using legal tactics to force the 
government to respond 
he sent a petition to the fda today asking it to stop its 
approvals of genetically engineered products the petition does not 
ask for a recall of existing products he said 
the studys authors did not link genetic engineering with the 
deaths 
based on our data we dont have sufficient information to say 
whether it was the strain or the amount of powdered carbon that 
contributed most said dr edward belongia one of the that 
studys authors 
and until we have more information about what the specific 
impurity was thats triggering ems how that impurity arose and how 
its synthesized its very difficult to make any statement about 
what needs to be done to make sure it doesnt happen in the 
future 
rifkin said that part of the support for his petition comes from 
an article submitted to science by the minnesota researchers but 
not yet published he said he did not have a copy of the science 
article 
the ltryptophan was made by showa denko kk of japan the 
company inserted a new gene through genetic engineering into 
strains of the bacteria bacillus amyloliquefaciens to enable the 
bacteria to produce ltryptophan 
in the strain linked to disease the inserted gene probably 
coupled with another tryptophan gene in the bacteria and increased 
the contaminant in the process that killed the 27 americans 
rifkin said 
rifkins petition also asks that the fda label all genetically 
engineered products now on the market and that it assess the risks 
of genetically engineered products in light of the new data

boris yeltsin the president of the russian 
republic said today that mikhail s gorbachev made a mistake by 
nullifying the republics bid to control its vast natural 
resources a news agency reported 
gorbachev issued a presidential decree thursday invalidating a 
resolution passed by the russian parliaments presidium to seize 
control of the republics raw materials such as gold and diamonds 
from the central soviet government 
yeltsin one of gorbachevs most outspoken critics said the 
decree was a blow to their efforts at cooperation 
the movement toward each other is not easy yeltsin told the 
independent interfax news agency in an interview from south 
sakhalinsk a pacific coast city he is visiting as part of a 
barnstorming tour across the russian republic the largest in the 
soviet union 
gorbachevs decree also was denounced by russian parliament 
leader vladimir isakov who told the official tass news agency that 
gorbachev the soviet president overstepped his authority 
yeltsin said he believed gorbachev had the right to cancel the 
parliaments decision because it was a resolution by the bodys 
presidium and not an act of the full legislature 
but he said it was another mistake by gorbachev who was 
infringing on russias sovereignty interfax reported 
the russian parliament acted because we saw that hard currency 
and gold were slipping away from russia but we do not know through 
what channels where to whom and how much yeltsin was quoted 
as saying 
this begins to look like crime i think a special deputies 
commission will have to be established to look into the matter and 
tell the people how much gold was exported where it went and what 
purposes it served he added 
russia had declared invalid all contracts signed without its 
approval to sell the republics diamonds metals oil gas 
uranium and even any manufactured product it considers strategic 
the aug 10 declaration had thrown into question scores of 
lucrative contracts including a 5 billion diamond deal with the 
de beers firm the leading diamond export dealer 
but on thursday russian deputy prime minister gennady filshin 
said the republic had now decided to honor all agreements even 
those forged without its consent interfax reported 
he specifically mentioned the diamond contract which was 
considered lucrative to both the republic and the soviet union 
gorbachev said russias initial stand could have caused 
serious damage to the countrys interests by complicating 
possibilities to buy goods and win credits which are needed so 
badly amid current economic difficulties 
it is effectively directed at undermining the economic 
sovereignty of other union republics since it usurps the right to 
manage products belonging to the union of soviet socialist 
republics he said 
gorbachev said thursday he would meet soon with yeltsin to 
coordinate plans to shift the soviet union to a market economy 
the two men appointed a joint commission this summer to develop 
a blueprint for abandoning the centrally planned economy

iraq is detaining about 100 american diplomats 
and dependents who fled to baghdad from the us embassy in kuwait 
the bush administration said today 
so far iraq has not directly linked closing the embassy in 
kuwait city to permitting the americans in baghdad to leave iraq a 
us official said but others said their plight obviously was tied 
to the dispute over the embassy which the iraqis have said must be 
closed today 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater with president bush in 
kennebunkport maine called on iraq to permit and facilitate the 
immediate departure of the americans from baghdad 
he said iraqi troops were at the embassy in kuwait and were not 
allowing anyone to leave or enter the building however fitzwater 
said they have not made any move against the embassy or intruded 
in any fashion the spokesman said 
appeals through the night to the iraqi government in washington 
and in baghdad failed to break the deadlock officials in 
washington speaking on condition of anonymity told the associated 
press 
one denounced the holdup as contrary to explicit commitments 
the officials also said that about a dozen iraqi soldiers 
appeared overnight at the embassy in kuwait city they are not 
surrounding it the situation seems to be fluctuating an 
official said 
fitzwater said the americans were supposed to go to turkey that 
was the first disclosure of their projected destination 
left behind at the embassy was a group of about a dozen us 
diplomats headed by ambassador nathaniel howell 
diplomats from a number of other governments who also fled to 
baghdad from kuwait city also are stranded in the iraqi capital 
the official said 
we have been working all night here and in baghdad to 
pressure the iraqi government to rescind the order an official 
said adding he did not expect a prompt resolution of the dispute 
about 100 are in the group including nearly 30 children they 
made the trip from kuwait city in a 33car caravan arriving in 
baghdad early today after a journey of nearly 20 hours 
iraqi president saddam hussein had promised them safe passage 
even though 2500 private us citizens in kuwait and more than 500 
in iraq are being refused permission to leave 
howel and the other us diplomats left behind in kuwait city 
are under instruction to keep the embassy open in spite of an order 
by saddam that it close by the end of today and shift operations to 
baghdad 
their primary mission is to keep in touch with the americans 
trapped in the country and termed hostages by president bush 
a number of other nations faced with the same order to close 
also will try to keep their embassies open 
according to reports iraqi troops surrounded at least five 
embassies in kuwait city this morning 
iraq has said keeping embassies open would amount to an act of 
aggression and that diplomats would no longer be protected by 
diplomatic immunity meaning they could be rounded up and held as 
hostages 
the state department on thursday said jordans border with iraq 
had been closed jordans king hussein has been critical of bushs 
dispatch of troops to saudi arabia 
even so thousands of refugees were able to cross and the 
jordanian interior ministry said today the border would be open 
the king has cast himself in the role of diplomatic middleman 
he has flown to yemen to try to launch mediation 
one of the americans evacuated from the embassy was injured in a 
collision and was left behind to be hospitalized in kuwait city 
her identity was not disclosed

the plane crash in ethiopia that killed rep 
mickey leland dtexas and 15 others last year probably was caused 
by pilot error an ethiopian government investigation found 
the ethiopian civil aviation authority said the pilot may have 
felt pressured to fly in bad weather because of the importance of 
the mission 
the report was released today by the national transportation 
safety board which assisted in the investigation a canadian 
safety expert also participated because the plane was built in 
canada 
leland who was chairman of the house select committee on 
hunger was flying from the ethiopian capital of addis ababa to 
fugnido a refugee camp on the sudanese border to inspect relief 
efforts three congressional staffers also were killed in the crash 
the plane ran into a mountainside more than an hour after 
takeoff aug 7 1989 the crash destroyed an emergency transmitter 
on the plane that could have helped rescuers the wreckage wasnt 
found for a week 
the accident was most probably due to pilot error in that by 
pushing too far and flying into an area of bad weather at very low 
altitude the flight crew may have failed to maintain visual 
contact with the ground and unknowingly collided with a mountain 
the report said 
the report said the plane a 1980 twin otter had no defects 
investigators faulted the pilot and flight crew for not properly 
studying weather along the route 
the report said the flight schedule was tight considering the 
weather organizers of the trip including leland and the flight 
crew discussed delays caused by the weather the report said 
the long delay on the one hand and the importance of the 
mission on the other may have created undue pressure and uneasiness 
on the flight crew it said 
the intended route was cloudy and rainy the plane was plotted 
to fly at 12500 feet and the pilot acknowledged reaching that 
altitude shortly after takeoff 
but witnesses who saw the plane about 25 miles before it crashed 
told authorities it was flying below the clouds at a low altitude 
the plane burned after crashing into a boulder 800 feet below the 
summit of a mountain 
the report said investigators could not determine whether the 
pilot or copilot was flying the plane when it crashed 
leland was making his second trip to the border region to focus 
attention on the hunger needs of sudanese whose homes had been 
ruined by civil war

a federal judge today struck down provisions 
of pennsylvanias abortion law that helped make it the most 
restrictive in the country 
senior us district judge daniel h huyett 3d ruled on 
challenges to the law by planned parenthood of southeastern 
pennsylvania and five abortion providers 
huyett struck down portions of the law that require a woman to 
notify her husband before getting an abortion wait 24 hours before 
getting an abortion and require minors to obtain the consent of at 
least one parent or a court order before an abortion 
the us territory of guam had banned all abortions except where 
the mothers life is threatened a federal judge ruled that law 
unconstitutional wednesday 
in the pennsylvania ruling the judge said that requiring 
parental notification unduly burdens a minor womans right to 
elect to end her preganancy 
attorneys for both sides have said they would probably file 
appeals first to the 3rd us circuit court of appeals and 
eventually the us supreme court 
safe legal abortion continues to be accessible to women in 
pennsyvlania because of the courts decision today said 
elizabeth hrendaroberts executive director of planned parenthood 
pennsylvania affiliates 
pennsylvanians would be well served if the commonwealth 
accepts this decision and stops squandering taxpayers money to 
promote government interference in personal matters and threaten 
womens lives she said 
robert gentzel a spokesman for state attorney general ernie 
preate jr said the ruling would be appealed within 30 days 
judge huyetts decision is disappointing but not unexpected 
it is the attorney generals duty to defend the constitutionality 
of state statutes and he intends to pursue all appropriate appeals 
including appealing to the united states supreme court if 
necessary gentzel said 
huyett quoted supreme court justice harry blackmuns warning 
about eroding abortion rights the signs are evident and very 
ominous and a chill wind blows 
what the future holds is not certain huyett said but one 
thing must be evident individuals can no longer feel as secure 
with the protections provided by the judiciary in this area 
instead a womans privacy rights and individual autonomy may soon 
be subjected to the vicissitudes of the legislative process 
abortion opponents want to use the case to return the abortion 
issue to the us supreme court to provide it with an opportunity 
to reverse the 1973 roe v wade decision that legalized abortion 
gentzel called the pennsylvania law a reasonable responsible 
approach to dealing with a very difficult question the legislature 
and governor were fully aware when this statute was enacted and 
signed that it would face challenges and that those challenges 
would take time to resolve 
huyett also ruled in the clinics favor in their challenge of 
the states definition of medical emergency which the clinic said 
was too vague and would leave doctors in a quandary 
most of the the disputed parts of the law were suspended pending 
huyetts ruling some of the sections were rewritten from a 1982 
statute much of which was struck down by the us supreme court in 
1986 
the disputed portions were amendments made in 1988 and 1989 to 
the abortion control act adopted in 1982 following the landmark 
ruling of 1973 
in a threeday trial in reading earlier this month lawyers for 
the state argued that the law would protect the interests of women 
and families 
the abortion clinic argued that the law would strip women of 
dignity could endanger their health and have a chilling effect on 
doctors who perform abortions 
there can be no doubt the challenged provisions burden womens 
rights to abortion said thomas zemaitis an attorney for the 
clinics 
the state argued that similar parentalconsent laws had been 
upheld in other states and that the husband should be told because 
the state had a legitimate interest in protecting the spouses 
interest 
zemaitis said requiring parental consent creates an impossible 
ethical dilemma for the minor he said anyone who arranges for an 
abortion has already thought it through and that the waiting period 
was written in to discourage abortions

iraqi troops patrolled near the us 
embassy in kuwait city and at least seven others today and a 
european envoy said baghdad threatened to use force to remove 
diplomats remaining at their posts saturday 
the white house meanwhile said lraq had reneged on its promise 
toallow us embassy personnel to leave baghdad and was detaining 
them the more than 100 american men women and children had left 
the us embassy in kuwait and were staying in the us embassy in 
baghdad said spokesman marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater said iraqi military forces of one kind or another 
are around the embassy in kuwait where ambassador nathaniel 
howell and a handful of aides remained 
they have not made any moves against the embassy or intruded 
in any fashion but they are nevertheless present it would appear 
that people are not being allowed to enter or leave the embassy 
fitzwater said at a briefing in kennebunkport maine 
iraq which invaded and annexed kuwait earlier this month has 
given foreign governments until 9 pm 1 pm edt today to vacate 
their embassies in kuwait diplomats in washington however said 
that deadline had been extended to midnight 
baghdad said keeping embassies open would amount to an act of 
aggression and that diplomats would no longer be protected by 
diplomatic immunity meaning they could be rounded up and held as 
hostages 
spains ambassador to amman ramon armengod told a news 
conference in madrid today that iraqi authorities told western 
embassies in kuwait that they now had until 830 am saturday 
1230 am edt to close 
he said that after that deadline iraqi troops would forcibly 
remove remaining western diplomats from their missions 
the japanese foreign ministry meanwhile said iraqi soldiers 
told the two japanese diplomats remaining in kuwait today that 
their diplomatic immunity had been revoked but made no attempt to 
remove them from the embassy 
there were conflicting reports of the extent of troop activity 
around embassies 
officials reported that troops were surrounding or patrolling 
near the american british french japanese norwegian swedish 
romanian and hungarian embassies the officials said they received 
the information from their embassy personnel in kuwait 
ambassador howell and a dozen other americans stayed at the 
palmshaded american compound a rectangle facing a sixlane 
highway bordering the persian gulf marine guards were among 33 
carloads of embassy personnel who drove to the iraqi capital 
baghdad on thursday 
the united states canada japan switzerland austria and the 
12 european community nations were among those who announced they 
would defy the order and remain in the occupied oilrich kingdom 
britains foreign secretary douglas hurd said today the soldiers 
posted outside the british embassy appear to have instructions 
not to allow people in or out 
he said british staff there would decide for themselve how to 
oppose the iraqis 
i dont expect no one expects unarmed diplomats to give 
physical resistance to physical force he said 
we dont know how many soldiers there are their intentions 
but there must be a lot enough to completely surround the entire 
building said bjoern blokhus a norwegian foreign ministry 
spokesman commenting on the situation at the embassy in kuwait 
blokhus said the iraqi soldiers had made no move against the 
diplomatic personnel inside the embassy 
egypt took one of most defiant stances announcing thursday that 
it would not close its embassy or reduce its staff of 20 
in cairo four truckloads of riot police remained outside the 
iraqi embassy where they have been stationed since the aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
soviet officials said in moscow they had evacuated all of their 
embassy personnel from kuwait but that they did not consider the 
mission closed 
the philippines india and lebanon are among those nations why 
said they would obey the order and close about 60 countries have 
embassies in kuwait 
personnel at the western embassies were reduced to a symbolic 
few staff and dependents from many embassies left kuwait city over 
the past few day 
fitzwater said thursday that the us diplomats would remain in 
kuwait as long as there are americans they can assist 
about 3000 americans are among the 21000 westerners stranded 
and threatened in iraq and kuwait there are also about 3000 
britons 
the us and british embassies are along the same corniche as 
those of saudi arabia uae qatar egypt lebanon india 
jordan turkey 
saudi arabias foreign ministry rejected iraqs demand thursday 
that missions close but the saudi embassy has been locked since 
the invasion and the ambassador is back in the kingdom 
travelers from kuwait have reported that scores of nationals 
from bahrain and the united arab emirates have sought sanctuary in 
their embassies the respective ambassadors have been trying 
unsuccessfully to organize evacuation convoys

ninety years after it officially 
became a commonwealth australia has received its birth 
certificate 
british deputy prime minister sir geoffrey howe on thursday 
night handed prime minister bob hawke one of the two originals of 
the commonwealth of australia constitution act 
that was the legislation passed by the british parliament on 
july 5 1900 which turned six colonies into the commonwealth of 
australia 
although the document has been on loan in parliament house here 
for the last two years it has taken a lot of tough talking with 
the british from prime minister margaret thatcher down to turn 
the loan into ownership 
the problem for the british was that in giving the document 
away it may have created a huge precedent 
as howe said britains constitutional archives were preserved 
in an unbroken series stretching back to the 13th century and were 
a cherished part of its heritage never before had an original copy 
of a british act been given away 
so carefully guarded was the collection that it required an act 
of the british parliament before it could be handed over

thousands of students protesting a 
government plan to reserve jobs for lowcaste hindus hijacked buses 
and clashed with police friday 
the students surged into streets stopping traffic and urging 
motorists to join their campaign arriving at the parliament aboard 
dozens of hijacked buses they tried to storm or encircle the 
building 
we dont want the politicians to come out of the parliament 
let them perish there said vinod kumar bist a firstyear 
university student 
police beat back the protesters with steeltipped bamboo poles 
set up rope and metal barricades and repeatedly fired tear gas 
traffic was paralyzed as the protests spread to major streets 
and intersections throughout the capital of 8 million people some 
protesters hurled stones through the windows of government 
buildings 
demonstrations began three weeks ago and have spread to a 
halfdozen states one of the first flashpoints was bihar indias 
poorest state where at least three people have died 
the trouble began when prime minister vp singh announced this 
month that the government would reserve an additional 27 percent of 
public sector jobs for categories of lowcaste hindus 
that would bring to 49 percent the share of government jobs 
reserved for lower castes and tribes the rest are awarded on merit 
singh a highcaste hindu has warned that lowcaste hindus must 
be given government help in getting jobs to head off unrest singh 
said disadvantaged communities comprise 52 percent of indias 
880 million people but have only 125 percent of government jobs 
his plan angered students from higher castes who called it 
reverse discrimination that would hurt their chances of finding 
work after graduation government jobs are prized because they 
provide security and benefits such as free housing 
the students shouted down with vp singh 
some chased a police dog in an attempt to place a sign reading 
i am vp singh around its neck 
hindus who make up 85 percent of indias population have a 
complex social system with hundreds of castes and subcastes that 
divide them into a rigid hierarchy highcaste hindus usually are 
better off economically than members of low castes 
discrimination on the basis of caste is outlawed but it 
persists especially in rural areas in many villages for example 
lower castes and outcasts live in segregated quarters and cannot 
take water from wells used by upper castes 
as the students shouted antigovernment slogans and burned their 
university degree certificates near parliament a street sweeper 
from a lower caste rested his broom to watch 
there is no need for the drama said the sweeper ram 
prasad we lowcaste hindus have suffered enough time has come 
to get our due share

two college students have stumbled upon 
the virtually untouched ruins of a 1100yearold anasazi indian 
village in southwestern colorado 
the sixacre mountain sheep village the name given the site 
probably had about 200 structures and may have housed 150 to 200 
indians as early as the year 850 ad said kristie arrington an 
archaeologist for the bureau of land management the agency that 
controls the discovery site 
the discovery is significant because the site is on the north 
side of the dolores river which wraps around it on three sides 
previously anasazi ruins have been found only south of the river 
the anasazi or ancient ones lived in the four corners 
area their bestknown ruins are the cliff dwellings in mesa verde 
national park in southwestern colorado the site discovered earlier 
this month by the university of colorado students is about 60 miles 
northwest of mesa verde not far from the utah border 
pottery fragments recovered at the site discovered by dave 
merritt and chris kuzawa date the site about 300 years before the 
height of mesa verde cliff dwellings 
arrington said the people of mountain sheep village may have 
traded big game and timber with other villages in exchange for food 
and pottery she said tools associated with game procurement and 
processing such as arrowheads scrapers and knives have been 
found on the ground 
local people hunting may have been through there and one area 
shows evidence that it had been potted a little bit said 
arrington but its fairly unusual that it hadnt been recorded 
and documented before now 
potting is a term used to describe the illegal digging for 
indian pots 
merritt and kuzawa are working out of the dolores canyon 
research center on a federal archaeology project this summer the 
project involves tracking desert bighorn sheep and river otters 
conducting an inventory of water invertebrates in the river and 
probing historic mining sites 
the two were tracking bighorn sheep with another student 
patricia dahnke when they discovered the ruins 
we were just hiking around and we found it merritt said 
we were just climbing up following bits of ceramics and lithic 
flint which were at the base of the cliffs where they shouldnt 
be 
they struggled over the rim of a cliff and found mounds and 
vertical slabs of sandstone sticking out of the ground 
the slabs are the foundations of structures made of poles brush 
and adobe 
it was pretty spectacular kuzawa said of the site which 
backs up to a forest of ponderosa pine once we realized what it 
was we started to look around we stayed until dusk we knew we 
were on to something pretty big

waldheim to iraq for a short minisummit in baghdad he would 
not elaborate

citizens to their homelands said a statement issued by the 
presidents office in vienna 
during his 10 years as un chief waldheim was personally

the us embassy in kuwait is not a hightech 
stronghold but rather a practical compound surrounded by a high 
wall 
its not a very fancy embassy but a very functional one 
said francois dickman a retired foreign service officer who was 
us ambassador to kuwait from 1979 to 1983 
its not one of the new fortresses that many american 
embassies around the world are increasingly said another 
diplomat who has served in kuwait speaking on the condition of 
anonymity 
the embassy across a sixlane highway from the beach has 
become the latest storm center of the growing persian gulf crisis 
its usual contingent of about a halfdozen marines were 
withdrawn thursday as the iraqi deadline for the closing foreign 
embassies in kuwait approached 
dickman said the decision to withdraw the marines made sense

thirteen family members and friends 
were in jail friday on charges of sexually abusing an 11yearold 
girl and two other children authorities said 
what we found was nasty business said neshoba county 
sheriff hubert g waddell when i have to look at these people we 
have incarcerated its hard for me not to vomit 
he said the 13 men and two women are charged with capital rape 
which carries a possible sentence of life in prison waddell said 
the accusations involve fondling and heterosexual and homosexual 
acts 
two defendants both in their 70s were released on 50000 bond 
because of their health waddell said the others either were being 
held in lieu of 50000 bond or without bond pending hearings 
the people involved are mothers daddies stepfathers 
exfathers said investigator bobby anderson of the philadelphia 
police department 
waddell said the 11yearold philadelphiaarea girl was sexually 
abused by at least nine different adults during the last two to 
three years he said two young boys whose ages were not given 
also were abused 
ive had to investigate sexual abuse cases but nothing on the 
scale of this said waddell there is a lot of trash involved 
and some money did come into the picture 
the sheriff said there also was evidence that the parents 
allowed the girl to be sexually abused in exchange for liquor and 
cigarettes 
all those charged are from the mostly rural county in 
eastcentral mississippi and included the parents of the girl and 
close relatives of the two boys there could be additional arrests 
authorities said 
waddell said the arrests created a space problem in his already 
crowded detention center he said the jail had been redesigned to 
hold 24 people weve got 30 in there right now including five or 
six state prisoners 
several county jails in mississippi are crowded with state 
inmates because of federal court orders that limits the number of 
prisoners at the state penitentiary at parchman 
waddell said a joint investigation began six weeks ago when his 
office and local police received a call from a concerned citizen 
who told us a baby sitter had called her and wanted her to report 
that this little girl had been raped 
we called in the county welfare department to pick up the girl 
and have her checked they put her in the hospital for treatment 
and got a counselor to start working with her 
i did talk to the girl quite a bit but she was hesitant to 
talk to male officers waddell said it was obvious to me that 
she had been abused 
authorities said it appeared the case reached beyond neshoba 
county and that officers in kemper attala and leake counties are 
being forwarded information about abuse that may have taken place 
there 
neshoba county district attorney ken turner said the case 
against the 15 arrested will be presented nov 5 to a county grand 
jury

duke kahanamoku considered the father of modern 
surfing is being honored with a statue but instead of facing his 
beloved ocean his likeness beckons tourists on the shore 
the 100th anniversary of kahanmokus birth was being marked 
friday with the dedication of a statue in waikiki 
kahanamoku was born in waikiki in 1890 and died there in 1968 
he fashioned long boards and set out with his friends to ride the 
gentle waves of waikiki as well as the big breakers around the 
island 
kahanamoku also brought surfing to the mainland historians 
report he rode a redwood surfboard near a popular pier in venice 
calif in the first decade of the century 
the statue by jan fisher is located at kuhio beach park 
but its placement started a controversy when the city wanted it 
facing inland instead of toward the ocean family members say the 
duke never would have wanted it that way as his life revolved 
around the water 
officials however said tourists wouldnt want to face the back 
of a statue so they placed it facing land and the dense line of 
hotels on waikiki beach 
kahanamoku competed in four olympics winning six medals three 
gold two silver and one bronze for swimming he was inducted 
into the us olympic hall of fame in 1984

iraqi troops today deployed near at least eight embassies in 
kuwait including the us mission where diplomats were defying 
shutdown orders from baghdad 
they have not made any moves against the embassy or intruded 
in any fashion but they are nevertheless present said white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater with president bush in 
kennebunkport maine it would appear that people are not being 
allowed to enter or leave the embassy 
in other developments in the persian gulf crisis the pentagon 
today began began calling reserve units to active duty to assist in 
the us military buildup in the persian gulf area and austrian 
president kurt waldheim set off for the mideast on a peacemaking 
mission that was to include a meeting with iraqi president saddam 
hussein 
the japanese foreign ministry meanwhile said iraqi soldiers 
told the two japanese diplomats remaining in kuwait today that 
their diplomatic immunity had been revoked but made no attempt to 
remove them from the embassy 
amid the brewing embassy standoff about 100 american diplomats 
and dependents who left the us embassy in kuwait have been 
indefinitely detained in the iraqi capital baghdad officials in 
washington said today 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity linked the 
detention of the group to the us refusal to close its embassy in 
kuwait and said it was contrary to explicit commitments by 
iraq of free passage for the americans 
but another escape route for foreigners remained open the 
jordanian border jordan had said wednesday it would close the 
frontier with iraq to refugees but it allowed thousands of people 
mainly arabs to cross today 
turkey however said it might close its border with iraq unless 
foreign governments made arrangements for speedy transit of 
refugees 
officials fear an influx of pakistanis since iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 7532 people have entered from iraq officials at the habur 
crossing said of these 3000 were turkish workers returning home 
and 2903 were pakistanis 
also today western diplomats said they expected the security 
council to vote today or saturday on a resolution resolution 
allowing the use of military force to put teeth in the un embargo 
against iraq 
in addition to patrolling near the us embassy in kuwait 
saddams troops who invaded the emirate aug 2 were out in force 
near the british french japanese norwegian swedish romanian 
and hungarian embassies said diplomatic officials citing 
information from embassies in kuwait 
we dont know how many soldiers there are their intentions 
but there must be a lot enough to completely surround the entire 
building said bjoern blokhus a norwegian foreign ministry 
spokesman commenting on the situation at his countrys embassy in 
kuwait 
the japanese foreign ministry said iraqi soldiers told the two 
japanese diplomats remaining in kuwait today that their diplomatic 
immunity had been revoked but made no attempt to remove them from 
the embassy 
there was uncertainty about the iraqi deadline for the embassy 
shutdowns 
the iraqi news agency has said foreign governments have until 9 
pm 1 pm edt to vacate the 60 embassies in kuwait diplomats 
in washington however said the deadline was extended to midnight 
spains ambassador to jordan ramon armengod told reporters in 
madrid today that iraqi authorities were saying foreign embassies 
had until 830 am saturday 1230 am edt to close or they 
would be removed by force 
us ambassador nathaniel howell and perhaps a dozen other 
americans stayed at the palmshaded american compound in kuwait 
city concrete barriers and steel spikes are among the security at 
the us embassy complex on arabian gulf boulevard 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters thursday 
at president bushs summer home in kennebunkport maine that us 
diplomats will remain in kuwait as long as there are americans 
that they can assist 
most us diplomatic personnel were evacuated thursday marine 
guards were among 33 carloads of americans who drove to the iraqi 
capital 
a few marine guards arent going to fight off the entire iraqi 
army a senior government official said thursday in washington 
in addition to the united states those countries ignoring 
iraqs shutdown order included japan the 12 european community 
nations switzerland and austria 
the dutch ambassador to kuwait joop veling was advised by his 
foreign ministry not to engage in any exaggerated heroism a 
government spokesman said in the hague 
saddam claimed kuwait as iraqi territory after his invasion and 
subsequent annexation of his oilrich southern neighbor baghdad 
says keeping embassies open in kuwait would amount to an act of 
aggression 
on thursday saddam appeared on television with british children 
and other captives ruffling the hair of a small boy smiling and 
joking but making it plain their fate depends on how the persian 
gulf confrontation goes 
he told about 20 adults and children they were guests being 
held to prevent the scourge of war 
state department spokesman richard boucher denounced the tv 
display as shameful theater 
about 3000 americans are among the 21000 westerners stranded 
in iraq and kuwait kept from leaving by saddam and threatened with 
being used as human shields around iraqi targets 
in another development thursday a us intelligence source 
reported that saddams elite republican guards which led the 
attack into kuwait are being replaced on the front lines of his 
defenses by other troops 
but the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
guards numbering perhaps more than 50000 according to nbc news 
could still be used in an iraqi attack on saudi arabia from kuwait 
it was fear of such an attack that prompted the united states to 
mount the multinational operation desert shield in the saudi desert 
to protect the kingdom and its huge oil reserves 
us defense secretary dick cheney on thursday approved plans to 
call 10000 military reservists to active duty over the next week 
and nearly 50000 by october to support the deployment of us 
troops ships and warplanes to the persian gulf 
the us aircraft carrier dwight d eisenhower and six escort 
ships sailed through egypts suez canal today en route from the red 
sea to the mediterranean canal officials said the eisenhower 
apparently was relieved by the carrier saratoga in the red sea and 
may be relieved in the mediterranean by the carrier kennedy which 
left virginia last week 
the us navy has a total of 37 ships either in the gulf or en 
route an unofficial count showed among them were four aircraft 
carrier battle groups and the battleship wisconsin 
waldheims office said he was flying to amman today for talks 
with jordans king hussein and would travel to baghdad saturday 
for a meeting with saddam 
the austrian president has been shunned by western leaders 
because of his wartime past but has maintained friendly ties with 
arab leaders including saddam

turkey feeling the strain of a refugee 
influx from neighboring iraq said friday it may have to close its 
only border post with iraq unless arrivals are quickly taken in by 
their home nations 
premier yildirim akbulut said turkey had information that 
refugees were massing on the iraqi side of the border the habur 
crossing gate was built for truck traffic and lacks facilities for 
large numbers of people he said 
turkey realizes the difficulties these people face and wants to 
do its humanitarian duty the premier said in a written statement 
but i must emphasize that it is not possible for us to provide 
food housing and transportation for tens of thousands of people 
special measures on passage may have to be taken or closure of 
the border may come on the agenda he warned 
jordan has faced a similar problem since iraq invaded kuwait on 
aug 2 it announced wednesday it was closing its border with iraq 
although people continue to cross the frontier 
turkish border officials say that since aug 2 7532 people 
have entered turkey through habur of these only 3000 were 
turkish people returning home another 2903 were pakistanis the 
next largest groups were romanians and yugoslavs 
pakistan has been unable to provide planes to pick up the 
refugees 
turkey is still dealing with refugees who poured into the 
country during other crises in recent years 
about 60000 kurdish refugees fleeing iraqi chemical bomb 
attacks poured into turkey two years ago close to 40000 of them 
still remain in refugee camps in southeast turkey 
last year turkey also faced a serious refugee problem when 
320000 ethnic turkish bulgarians fled to escape persecution by the 
bulgarian government since the ouster of bulgarias communist 
leaders many ethnic turks have returned to bulgaria but about 
half stayed in turkey 
turkey is also home to an estimated 1 million iranians who fled 
iran during the iraniraq war 
meanwhile turkeys military chief of staff gen necip 
torumtay and force commanders traveled to the southern city of 
diyarbakir north of the iraqi border to check defense measures 
undertaken by land and air force units 
the manager of the stateowned tire factory petlas told the 
anatolia news agency the factory had been asked to increase 
production to meet the needs of military vehicles 
a stateowned company producing gas masks announced thursday it 
was increasing production by 50 percent 
some units of the turkish air force and several land forces 
brigades in the southeast have been placed on a state of advanced 
readiness officials have said they do not anticipate an iraqi 
attack but that high tensions warrant taking defensive military 
measures

sen paul simon a frequent critic of the 
governments handling of the savings and loan crisis reportedly 
helped a developer last month who owed millions of dollars to a 
troubled thrift 
the chicago suntimes today in a copyright story reported that 
after simon approached thrift officials on behalf of the developer 
a longtime simon supporter talks got under way and the sampl now 
is in the final steps of working out a negotiated settlement to a 
lawsuit it filed against the developer 
simon dill told reporters today he did nothing wrong 
i did the same thing that i did for thousands of other 
citizens simon said i did not pretend to know any of the 
details 
simon told the newspaper he was unaware that he was intervening 
in a matter that involved a troubled savings and loan and did 
nothing improper the thrifts officials said simons call did not 
influence their actions 
simon asked the president of first nationwide financial corp in 
san francisco to work out an agreement with stephen ballis who 
owes 5 million to the institution the newspaper said 
first nationwide received taxpayer help recently to buy pathway 
financial of chicago which was the secondlargest troubled savings 
and loan in illinois until it was bailed out by the government at 
the end of 1988 
ballis company dayton resources defaulted on a pathway loan 
used to build a 19unit condominium complex the newspaper said 
first nationwide then sued to foreclose on the property and have 
ballis replaced by a courtappointed receiver the sampl has now 
nearly finalized a negotiated settlement to that lawsuit the 
newspaper said 
after meeting with ballis in chicago this summer simon said he 
called first nationwides president during the conversation simon 
said he told the president he didnt know the details of the 
dispute but costly litigation could be avoided if they sat down 
with ballis and worked things out 
i just said take a look at it you can save a lot of 
money simon recalled i did not push anyone to do anything 
improper and i would not do that 
first nationwide president john devine said the call prompted 
him to look into the dayton resources loan but did not influence 
the way the sampl handled the case 
ballis said he had campaigned and raised funds for simon since 
his first senatorial race but simon said ballis support had 
nothing to do with his intervention 
i help people whether they are contributors or not simon 
said 
simon last week held a chicago hearing on the savings and loan 
crisis in which he urged stricter prosecutions of those who 
defrauded the nations thrifts in what has been estimated to be a 
500 billion boondoggle for taxpayers 
after the phone call ballis was contacted by first nationwide 
and worked out a settlement of the dispute ballis said 
in april 1989 ballis ran out of loan money for the condominium 
project and pathways new owners refused to come up with any more 
money the newspaper said dayton resources than stopped work on 
the still incomplete project 
ballis blamed cost overruns on design changes made at pathways 
request

republics to make some move toward greater autonomy a news service 
reported 
the republics supreme soviet or parliament passed the 
declaration after a stormy sixhour session the independent news 
service interfax said the measure said tadzhikistans laws will 
take precedence over soviet laws

postal officials and union leaders on friday 
formally opened what will likely be months of grueling contract 
talks 
i hope that the parties will communicate together and work 
together to gain a contract marked by fairness and flexibility 
said postmaster general anthony m frank 
vernon h meier president of the 85000member national rural 
letter carriers association said he views the talks as a 
challenge and an opportunity 
the financiallystrapped postal service is preaching moderation 
meaning it hopes that workers will hold down their financial 
demands 
but union leaders say their members shouldnt suffer because of 
managements inability to improve efficiency and hold down costs 
we dont want the public to be gouged but were not going to 
take the blame for poor management either moe biller president 
of the american postal workers union said prior to the talks 
labor contracts between the us postal service and its four 
largest unions expire nov 20 the labor groups represent 660000 
workers 
billers accusations center on the services push towards 
automation which he said has wasted money without improving 
efficiency he says automation also costs thousands of jobs 
postal service spokesman lou eberhardt called charges of 
mismanagement prebargaining rhetoric 
automation joins wages as a key issue in efforts to agree on new 
threeyear contracts 
the postal service faces a deficit of between 14 billion and 
16 billion this fiscal year which ends sept 30 
because the agency no longer subsidized by taxpayers must 
break even over time the board of governors has proposed to raise 
the cost of mailing a letter from 25 cents to 30 cents next spring 
testifying in march before congress frank called on the unions 
to show constructive restraint in wage demands he said 83 
percent of the postal services costs go for wages and benefits 
as of this month letter carriers receive a starting salary of 
24381 which includes a costofliving adjustment the postal 
service says most clerks and carriers earn a maximum of 31516 
which also includes a costofliving increase the postal service 
says employees receive an additional 8560 in benefits and premium 
pay 
joseph mahon assistant postmaster general for labor relations 
said that the average 20 an hour makes postal workers better paid 
than their counterparts in private business 
the average hourly wage for american workers is 10 workers 
with tasks similar to those of postal workers make more than the 
average worker though for instance united parcel service workers 
just ratified a new contract giving them nearly 18 an hour by 1992 
the postal service has not drafted specific wage proposals to 
take to the bargaining table 
billers union is the largest representing 334000 clerks 
maintenance employees drivers and special delivery messengers 
other bargaining groups are the national letter carriers 
association representing 234000 urban letter carriers the 
national postal mail handlers union representing 50000 mail 
handlers and the national rural letter carriers association 
representing 42000 rural letter carriers 
glenn berrien president of the mail handlers union says postal 
workers deserve raises because layoffs in recent years force many 
to do the jobs of two he said postal workers are also exposed to 
hazards handling everything from bees to farm chemicals

falling back slightly traders bought shares to take advantage of 
the recent declines and to bulwark positions to hedge against

been oversold since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 the index shed 
51633 points or 17 percent through thursday since closing just 
below 3000 on july 17 
bond prices meanwhile gave back early gains on pessimism about 
oil prices inflation and the possibility of war in the middle east

per 1000 in face amount at midafternoon as its yield climbed to 
916 percent from 913 percent late thursday 
the bond market had rallied slightly on a government report that 
the economy grew at a lackluster annual rate of 12 percent in the 
apriljune quarter that boosted bonds on a belief the federal 
reserve may be forced to lower interest rates to stimulate the 
economy which many experts believe was verging on a recession even 
before the mideast turmoil

higher today prices rose in tokyo after fluctuations influenced by 
reports that elite iraqi invasion forces in kuwait were being 
replaced by second and thirdstring troops

nearly 700 points as market players began buying after an nbc news 
report that iraq had ordered some elite troops withdrawn from the 
kuwaitisaudi arabian border said tomoya koda a trader with new 
japan securities co 
the market first took the news as a sign that iraq was 
withdrawing from the border because many investors were 
desperately seeking an excuse to buy after thursdays huge losses 
koda said 
but iraqi president saddam hussein replaced the elite forces 
with lesser units and the nikkei lost some of this mornings 
earlier gains when investors started selling koda said 
markets remained nervous as foreign diplomats in kuwait defied 
orders to shut down and the skeleton staff at the us mission 
braced for possibilities ranging from a takeover to a supply cutoff 
the financial market selloff has been tied to uncertainty over 
the future of world oil supplies which have been reduced because 
of an international embargo of iraqi and kuwaiti crude the 
prospect of war has worsened fears

reaching 3225 a barrel matching the highest level since futures 
contracts for oil were inaugurated in 1983

abe lincoln the robot beat kermit the 
frog in a quiet civil war at disneyland 
disneyland will keep the great moments with mr lincoln 
show which park officials had planned to close this weekend no 
longer would the nations 16th president rise from his chair 51 
times a day to deliver excerpts from his speeches 
park operators reportedly planned to replace the show with a new 
muppets attraction 
but tourists and park employees were irked by the idea and 
disneyland officials apparently backed off from their plans for 
now 
if youd asked a few days ago id have said that being a 
25yearold attraction its popularity has passed said park 
spokesman paul goldman but there seems to be a lot of sentiment 
for lincoln 
for one park visitor 12yearold abby hangsleben of east grand 
forks minn kermit just cant compare to honest abe 
lincoln was president kermit is a frog she said 
disney officials refuse to disclose attendance figures but 
acknowledge that park visitors recently havent shown a lot of 
interest in the lincoln show 
reports had circulated for months among disneylands 8000 
employees that the main street opera hall which houses the lincoln 
show and exhibits honoring park founder walt disney would be 
turned over to kermit miss piggy and big bird 
last week officials said the lincoln exhibit would be closed on 
sunday for the refurbishing of the opera house 
but goldman said thursday park planners were looking at several 
other sites for the muppets including an area near the its a 
small world attraction 
its a matter of shoehorning things in he said 
disney purchased rights to several of the muppets characters 
last year and plans to use kermit miss piggy big bird and the 
gang in shows and parades at the park

the bush administration said today 
that iraqi troops are blocking the us embassy in kuwait and that 
saddam husseins government is preventing a large group of american 
diplomats and dependents from leaving iraq 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the iraqi troops 
outside the embassy in kuwait are not allowing people to enter or 
leave however he added im not aware of any confrontations 
between the iraqi soldiers and the small group of americans inside 
the facility led by ambassador nathaniel howell 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
iraqi guards are controlling entry and exit from the compound 
he said one embassy vehicle was prevented from entering the grounds 
today 
boucher said the small staff was still in contact with some 
americans trapped in kuwait but was hindered by restraints on their 
movements and because we know that the iraqis are monitoring the 
embassys local telephone calls in an attempt to locate american 
citizens 
iraq has demanded that the embassy be closed and the 
administration has refused 
instead it reduced the staff to a minimum and an estimated 100 
diplomats and dependents travelled overnight to baghdad 
thats the group that fitzwater said is being prevented from 
departing the country for turkey or other destinations they are 
safe he said but unable to depart 
he said the administration holds iraq responsible for the safety 
of all americans in iraq and kuwait 
the spokesman said bush continues to follow developments in the 
persian gulf crisis carefully and had met during the morning with 
his national security adviser brent scowcroft and others 
fitzwater also said it was sick beyond expression that 
saddam hussein appeared in a videotape on thursday with british 
children being held hostage in iraq it showed the cynical and 
inhuman view that iraqs leader holds for human life he said 
with thousands of american troops already in the persian gulf 
and thousands more on the way and a partial callup of the 
reserves ordered fitzwater said bush would return to washington 
on tuesday to meet with congressional leaders on the crisis 
fitzwater told reporters the iraqis had reneged on their 
explicit commitment to permit american diplomats and families 
in kuwait and iraq to depart 
he called on iraq to heed a united nations resolution that would 
permit these people to leave the region and said 
the united states also reminds iraq that it will be held 
responsible for the safety and wellbeing of american citizens 
being held hostage he said there are an estimated 2500 private 
us citizens in kuwait and more than 500 in iraq 
as for the embassy facility in kuwait which iraq has ordered 
shut down fitzwater stressed the administration will not comply 
he said iraqi soldiers are around the embassy and it would 
appear that people are not being allowed to leave or to enter the 
embassy 
he said the facility has electrical and water service despite 
the presence of iraqi troops outside they have not made any move 
against the embassy or intruded in any fashion he said of the 
iraqi forces 
he also said the situation was duplicated around other embassies 
in kuwait although he did not identify them by name 
fitzwater said american officials are in contact with howell 
asked what the ambassador would do if the iraqis tried to forcibly 
invade the embassy he said 
force has not been applied should he be subject to that he 
will have to act accordingly fitzwater said 
the united states withdrew the complement of marine guards that 
normally protects the embassy one official said at the time the 
announcement was made that the decision was made to protect 
american lives and noted that a few marines could not fight the 
iraqi army 
the decision to leave howell and a handful of aides in the 
nearly empty embassy was made as a symbol of our rejection of 
iraqs illegal occupation and annexation of kuwait fitzwater 
said 
an official said one woman traveling with the group to baghdad 
was injured when two of the cars collided at the start of the trip 
she was left at a kuwait city hospital 
president bush started his day with a dawn golf game with his 
two sons jeb of florida and george w of texas bush refused to 
answer reporters questions on the persian gulf crisis he sped 
away in his golf cart saying new policy an apparent 
reference to his recent ruling that he will not answer questions on 
serious matters while golfing 
bush went boating thursday with national security adviser brent 
scowcroft and playing tennis at his seaside home while monitoring 
the tense persian gulf developments fitzwater sought to put out 
assurances that this is a matter that is constantly with him 
even though he is away from washington 
on a separate front the white house kept close tabs on progress 
in united nations talks on whether to sanction use of force to back 
up the trade embargo against iraq 
the soviet and us ambassadors disagreed on whether the five 
permanent security council members had reached agreement on a 
resolution allowing minimum force to halt all ships bound for 
or leaving iraq 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said the us navy has boarded 
a handful of ships in its weekold effort to halt iraqi 
shipping he said he could not give a definitive number nor say 
when or where the boardings occurred 
bush said earlier he was willing to give the un some time to 
see if it would agree on a resolution endorsing military 
enforcement but also has said the united states already has the 
legal authority it needs to carry out such enforcement unilaterally 
at the pentagon defense secretary dick cheney approved plans to 
call 10000 military reservists to active duty over the next week 
and nearly 50000 by the end of september the reserves will back 
up the huge us military presence in the persian gulf 
the pentagon also announced the first deployment of american 
forces from european nato bases to the middle east buildup troops 
from the us army europes 7th medical command based in west 
germany are heading to the persian gulf area as part of operation 
desert shield 
bush today also planned to turn to domestic affairs he 
scheduled a meeting at his vacation home with treasury secretary 
nicholas brady and budget director richard darman to discuss 
deficitreduction talks that will resume in september with 
congressional negotiators

a federal appeals court ruled friday that the 
government is acting properly in setting auto mileage standards 
without preparing formal environmental impact statements 
the court in a 21 decision rejected a series of lawsuits by 
the state of california the cities of los angeles and new york 
and several environmental and safety groups challenging the way the 
national highway traffic safety administration sets annual 
standards for the auto industry 
chief judge patricia m wald dissented saying the agency acted 
arbitrarily when it determined its mileage standards would have no 
significant impact on global warming 
the traffic agency sets mileage standards that automakers must 
achieve as an average for their models each year it was 26 miles 
per gallon for model years 198788 and was slightly higher at 265 
for 1989 
the government entities the center for auto safety public 
citizen the union of concerned scientists and the natural 
resources defense council filed suits covering mileage standards 
for 198788 most of the same plaintiffs joined a suit over the 
1989 standards 
the court ruling rejected all of the complaints 
the plaintiffs argued that failure to implement higher standards 
would cause more air pollution and said the agency should be 
required to determine exactly how the air would be affected in 
various cities 
the court said the traffic safety agency conducted extensive 
evaluations of the impact of its standards on fuel consumption and 
emissions 
it said the agency also has committed itself to preparing a 
cumulative environmental impact statement on the entire mileage 
standards system 
that program should provide additional assurance that the 
agency is not making decisions with environmental consequences that 
escape its full consideration judge douglas ginsburg said in the 
majority decision 
wald in dissenting proposed that the matter be sent back to 
the agency for a better explanation of its decisions under 
environmental laws but she said there was no need to immediately 
roll back the standards 
she said the agency fails completely to explain how the 
cumulative effect it anticipates will affect the nonattainment 
areas referring to communities that have failed to meet clean 
air standards set by the environmental protection agency 
those include los angeles other california cities and new york

frequent iraqi troop movements keep 
tankkilling american apache helicopters locked and loaded and 
ready in the air near the saudikuwait border army officers said 
friday 
the iraqis one officer said move around so much you cant 
always be sure right away what theyre up to so you stay ready 
even though an invasion of saudi arabia is not considered imminent 
a small group of reporters visited the aviation brigade of the 
101st airborne division an airassault unit at its base in the 
saudi desert it was the first time reporters had been allowed into 
the base camp which is within range of iraqi forces just over the 
border in occupied kuwait 
several ah64 apache pilots and copilots interviewed friday 
said they had been on missions to the border area to familiarize 
themselves with flying conditions and the terrain below 
the apaches with hellfire missiles and multiple rocket pods 
are the militarys main weapon against iraqi tanks the helicopters 
are designed for both night and day combat 
we can take out 200 tanks easy in about two hours said lt 
col dick cody commander of an apache battalion its a 
tactical fighters dream out here 
additional airdefense systems were installed in the apaches 
before they were sent to saudi arabia and even more advanced 
systems designed to detect and defend against enemy fire are 
expected to be brought into saudi arabia for frontline units the 
officers said 
they were upgraded to match what theyve iraqi forces got 
one pilot said 
the camp which would be used as a staging area for repair and 
refueling bases in the event of combat is expanding each day as 
more men equipment and supplies arrive ground rules for the 
pentagon pool operation prohibit the disclosure of its location 
most details of the apache defense systems are classified but 
they are designed to destroy approaching enemy fire or to confuse 
guidance systems 
during a display for the journalists two apaches flew north 
over the saudi desert hugging the ground and sometimes hiding 
behind sand dunes the reporters watched from a blackhawk 
helicopter 
col tom garrett the brigade commander said the division 
receives constant updates on iraqi troop and tank movements and 
could quickly respond to an incursion into saudi arabia 
weve been told we should get a 6 to 8hour heads up when 
they start moving around but we can be ready pretty fast if need 
be garrett said 
were not worried about it he said of the iraqi tank 
threat we are locked and loaded and ready to go 
the apaches are equipped with state of the art radar and other 
scanning systems and the weapons use laser and computercontrolled 
guidance systems 
the hellfire never has been used in combat but garrett said it 
had performed well in training missions livefire training is 
planned for the saudi desert he said 
the apaches because of the antitank capabilities were among 
the earliest arrivals in saudi arabia their engines are being 
flushed daily because of sand but garrett and several pilots said 
they had experienced few weatherrelated problems 
weve got two enemies out here garrett said one is the 
environment the other is the iraqis

a federal judge refused to dismiss tax charges 
brought against a former cia agent saying irancontra independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh has the jurisdiction to bring the case 
officials said friday 
as a result thomas g clines trial on the fourcount 
indictment will begin as scheduled sept 4 in baltimore said mary 
belcher spokeswoman for walshs office 
clines assisted the nicaraguan contra arms resupply network run 
by richard v secord and albert hakim and overseen by thenwhite 
house aide oliver north he helped locate a european arms dealer as 
a source of weapons helped arrange for shipping and lined up crews 
to transport the supplies to the rebels 
accused of hiding arms sales profits from the government clines 
was indicted feb 22 on charges of under reporting his income to 
the internal revenue service and failing to report foreign 
financial accounts to the treasury department if convicted on all 
counts he could face a maximum of 21 years in prison and 950000 
in fines 
the ruling thursday by us district judge norman p ramsey in 
baltimore came as no surprise to clines attorney paula junghans 
he basically told us that orally months ago junghans said 
all he was doing was cleaning up the record and writing it down 
ramsey rejected both clines bid to dismiss the charges and to 
suppress financial records obtained through the use of a usswiss 
treaty 
clines had contended in his motion to dismiss that the alleged 
tax crimes were without any relationship whatsoever to the events 
of the affair 
junghans said the tax case were outside the irancontra 
prosecutors jurisdiction because mr clines has not been charged 
with committing any crime by virtue of his participation in the 
purchase sale or transfer of arms nor has he been charged with 
any crime relating to support to the contras 
however walshs office had argued that crimes involving the 
attempt to hide arms sale profits were within walshs purview 
the independent counsel said clines illegally misrepresented 
on his tax returns the full amount of his arms sales profits and 
that he illegally hid from the united states government the 
existence of the foreign financial accounts in which he maintained 
some of his profits 
ramsey agreed with the prosecutor saying the court finds 
that the alleged criminal activity falls within the independent 
counsels jurisdiction 
in addition ramsey rejected clines motion to suppress 
financial records on swiss bank accounts because they were obtained 
through use of the usswitzerland treaty 
prosecutors said the only swiss records to be used are those 
produced by hakim 
the judge ruled that even if the government used information 
obtained through the treaty clines would have no standing to 
challenge their use as evidence

here is the conclusion to senior us 
district judge daniel h huyetts ruling striking down portions of 
pennsylvanias abortion law 
for now at least the law of abortion remains undisturbed 
because only the united states supreme court has the power to 
change it 
but those individuals who have felt secure over the past 17 
years with the fundamental right and the protections which flow 
therefrom guaranteed by roe v wade would be wise to heed justice 
blackmuns admonition the signs are evident and very ominous 
and a chill wind blows 
what the future holds is not certain but one thing must be 
evident individuals can no longer feel as secure with the 
protections provided by the judiciary in this area instead a 
womans privacy rights and individual autonomy may soon be 
subjected to the vicissitudes of the legislative process 
therefore the protection afforded will depend on the ballot 
box and the nature of the protection if any could vary from 
termtoterm depending on the composition of the legislature 
if unprotected by their vote and the votes of other prochoice 
advocates many women will be forced to seek abortion services 
elsewhere for those that can afford it this may only mean 
traveling to another jurisdiction for those that cannot the 
result may well be disastrous and tragic but for now at least 
the law of abortion remains undisturbed

a federal appeals court friday upheld rules 
that require wouldbe radio or tv licensees such as home shopping 
channels make only the briefest assertions that their programming 
will serve the public interest 
the ruling affirmed an important part of the overall 
deregulation of broadcasting that began in the early 1980s under 
the reagan administration 
the case arose when challengers tried to prevent the federal 
communications commission from awarding licenses in cleveland and 
baltimore to subsidiaries of the home shopping network whose 
roundtheclock sellathon stations hawk merchandise to television 
viewers through telephone orders 
hsn stations typically devote a small portion of their days to 
public affairs or news shows in order to meet fcc requirements that 
stations provide nonentertainment programming responsive to 
issues of concern in the community to be served 
due to revisions the fcc made beginning in 1981 license 
applicants currently must make only a brief narrative 
description of proposed programming that indicates they 
understand and intend to comply with their public service 
obligations and not make specific promises of what their 
programming will be 
the fcc reasoned that locking applicants into promised 
programming would limit their ability to adapt to changing market 
conditions 
gigi sohn an attorney for the media access project which 
represented one of the challengers the united church of christ 
said the short boilerplate statement now required is 
insufficient to show that an applicant intends to serve the 
publics needs particularly for children 
she said home shopping channels claim they present news 
programing that meets the needs of children but theyll have the 
same news clip four or five times a day 
the fcc had rejected the challenges in a series of rulings and 
a threejudge panel of the 2nd us circuit court of appeals on 
friday unanimously sided with the commission 
writing for the court circuit judge james l buckley said the 
commissions rules were consistent with the authority granted the 
fcc under the 1934 communications act and that the fccs rules 
provide the commission with sufficient information that granting 
the applicants license would serve the public interest 
buckley was joined by judges ruth b ginsburg and harry t 
edwards 
also friday the court ruled that the fcc properly had waived 
its duopoly rules to allow one hsn subsidiary to own stations 
in both vineland nj and nearby newark nj even though the 
station signals would overlap

exled zeppelin vocalist robert plant says his 
heavy metal band was wrongly accused of slipping satanic messages 
in its albums long before the current judas priest flap 
i mean who on earth would have ever thought of doing that in 
the first place youve got to have a lot of time on your hands to 
even consider that people would do that plant said in an 
interview with rolling stone magazine 
plant said if his band had used the backward masking where the 
lyrics can only be heard by playing an album backwards it might 
have included a message more moneydriven than malicious 
i figure if backward masking really worked every record in 
the store would have buy this album hidden in it said plant 
in reno nev a judge ruled friday that hidden words do exist 
on an album by the british rock band judas priest but the judge 
ruled they were not placed there intentionally and the group was 
not responsible for a suicide pact formed by two young fans 
washoe district judge jerry carr whitehead said the alleged 
words do it were the result of a chance combination of sounds

has just been set free 
earlier today an irish envoy arrived in damascus where freed 
western hostages have been taken in the past 
if the irna report is confirmed the 39yearold kennan would 
become the fifth western hostage freed in the last five months 
others released during that time are us hostages robert 
polhill and frank reed and two swiss red cross workers elio 
erriquez and emanuel christen 
kennans release was expected because a senior iranian official 
deputy foreign minister mahmoud vaezi had told a newspaper that 
the irishman would be set freed today the irna report that keenan 
had been set free in lebanon came several hours after vaezi had 
predicted the release would take place 
in his interview with the tehran times vaezi had thanked the 
islamic groups in lebanon who once more showed their goodwill 
toward the west by deciding to release a western hostage 
he said keenan was being released after several months of 
efforts of the iranian officials and islamic groups in lebanon 
many of the kidnappers of westerners in lebanon are proiranian 
we expect that the west will take similar steps fof the 
freedom of lebanese prisoners and iranian hostages vaezi said 
such a move will make our efforts for the freedom of a hostages 
easier 
almost all hostages freed from captivity in lebanon have been 
handed to syrian officers in lebanon and then escorted to damascus 
overland a trip through winding mountainous roads that takes up to 
three hours 
earlier today syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa told 
reporters in damascus that he was hopeful that a western hostage 
would be released we are in touch with the iranians and with 
certain lebanese groups he said 
irelands ambassador to saudi arabia declan connolly arrived 
in damascus today saying we are quite hopeful that keenan will 
be released 
keenan was kidnapped on april 11 1986 in west beirut while 
walking to his job as an english teacher at the american university 
in beirut 
if the irna report is confirmed the number of westerners 
believed held by extremist moslem groups in lebanon would fall to 
13 
in addition to keenan they include six americans four britons 
two west germans and an italian the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
who was abducted march 16 1985 
iran has linked the western hostages to the fate of four 
iranians kidnapped by christian lebanese forces militiamen in july 
1982 
although the four are widely believed to have been killed 
iranian leaders have repeated stressed that they would use their 
influence to secure the release of western hostages in exchange for 
help in freeing the iranians 
i hope in the future all the hostages will be released 
vaezi was quoted as saying we will try our best no matter which 
nationality they are we will try our best for their freedom 
we should make our efforts to pave the way the use of our 
influence in this direction so that all may be freed he said

when maggie eylers got word that she was among the us 
reservists returning to active duty within the next five weeks she 
called her lawyer to check on her will and a divorce settlement 
she also began preparing her four children ages 15 to 21 for 
her departure 
we talked all day we shed a couple tears said eylers 
39 of iowa city iowa were all scared that goes without 
saying but were all confident things are going to be ok 
to be sure the 49703 men and women being ordered into action 
chose to put themselves in the position of getting called but the 
thought that it was their choice to sign up for the reserves did 
little to ease their anxieties which extend to the jobs and 
accompanying benefits theyre leaving behind 
meantime theyve been trying to get their houses in order 
arranging child care completing legal matters and saying goodbye 
at fort benning ga spec 4 hollie vallance cradled her 
newborn daughter in her arms finding it hard to say goodbye 
i love you take care of her she told her civilian 
husband anthony kirk as she handed 7weekold cheyenne to him 
the sight of soldiers leaving their families was common at fort 
benning this week as the armys 197th infantry brigade began moving 
out to join the growing us force in the middle east 
overwhelmed kirk struggled to explain his emotions for the 
past two weeks he and his wife a 21yearold medic had talked 
about this reversal of roles he practiced feeding and changing 
diapers she cleaned her gun and packed her bag careful not to 
bend the photographs of her first child 
ive thought about it a lot like now he said she told 
me its just like a training maneuver shell be back 
phoenix firefighter rick salyers has faced danger in his job 
and he indulges in such risky hobbies as scuba diving and sky 
diving but his wife and three children are worried that he may 
ship off to the middle east 
its the chemicalwarfare stuff said salyers the 
35yearold marine corps reserve i think thats what worries 
them the most my teenage daughters are concerned i could see the 
anguish in their faces 
said mrs salyers i tell myself i can take it that itll be 
ok but i really dont know 
the crisis in the persian gulf hit home elsewhere too 
for a pair of 10yearold girls with military fathers the 
uncertainty of the situation inspired them to write a song 
elizabeth finocchio and heather hogsed of fayetteville nc 
wrote lyrics titled whats going on 
i almost cried when i read it said heathers mother pamela 
yarborough it really shows how they felt and that theyre kind 
of frightened by whats going on 
in newburgh ny some 150 members of the 137th military 
airlift squadron based at stewart international airport were 
briefed before going to the persian gulf said ed weber the deputy 
commander 
that means talking about things many people dont like hearing 
about like wills and insurance he said 
reservists also worried about other things that they would 
prefer not to like job and health benefits 
its been so long since a mobilization occurred i think some 
people joined up thinking it would never happen said lt bruce 
fowlerexecutive officer of the naval and marine corps reserve 
center in alameda calif 
while federal law protects reservists jobs some personnel 
could lose out financially 
my biggest concern is for some of the junior people who make 
only about 15000 a year in the military said fowler they 
may have higher civilian salaries and the san francisco bay area 
is an expensive place to live 
under federal law an employer must provide returning reservists 
with their job or one with comparable seniority status pay and 
any raises they might have received 
one of the benefits of military service is that reservists and 
their families are covered by the defense departments health and 
life insurance programs relatives also have access to cutrate 
military grocery stores 
but the military medical plan becomes active only after the 
reservist has been on duty for more than 30 days meaning there 
could be problems for those who serve fewer than 30 days 
some companies including pacific bell continue health benefits 
until military benefits start 
ibm which has about 19000 people in silicon valley also will 
help with health benefits in addition ibm will make up the 
difference if a worker makes less money than they did at their 
former job said company spokesman walt kesshan

thrill of victory 
and fans at the fourth annual rat olympics were careful not give 
a big hand to evita who has been known to bite the hand that feeds 
her student trainers joked that her snack of choice is finger 
food 
weve never had a rat bite before but word has it evita has 
bitten several people said psychology professor lyn raible 
creator of the rodent recreations 
about 25 psychology students trained the 14 participating rats 
in lieu of writing a term paper raible came up with the idea for 
the games in 1987 as a way to enliven her summer course work for 
students but there was another motive 
most of my students will go on to do research and i wanted 
them to think of rats as more than laboratory animals on which to 
experiment raible said after working with the rats the 
students see them in a different light 
students used breakfast cereals as rewards to train their 
fourlegged athletes 
this year someone built a scale model of the empire state 
building which the rats were trained to climb to rescue a 
miniature replica of king kong 
some of the students really develop quite a bond with their 
rats raible said i see them hugging and kissing them really 
sometimes its almost disgusting

a company that started building a 60 million 
magnetically levitated passenger rail system in las vegas has 
abandoned the project leaving behind concrete track pillars and an 
unfinished station 
magnetic transit of america inc cited financial difficulties 
and reasons beyond our control for pulling out of the elevated 
rail project thursday 
it has become increasingly evident that termination is the 
only responsible business decision to be made said mta president 
john kapala 
mta had built a dozen track pillars and a station at the 
childrens museum in the new downtown library as part of its plan 
to run a 11mile magnetically levitated system through the 
downtown area 
the company was rebuffed in its efforts to link the proposed 
system with the las vegas strip the glitzy heart of the casino 
district kapala said that was a very important element in the 
decision to scrap the project 
city councilman arnie adamsen said the west german company 
pulled out purely for business reasons 
adamsen said the company intended the system to be a 
demonstration of the new technology and hoped to eventually link it 
to the strip mccarran international airport and other parts of the 
las vegas valley 
it wasnt going to be a revenue producer adamsen said it 
was presented to me as the first leg of a transportation system in 
the valley 
adamsen said city officials who obtained a 16 million grant 
from the federal government to build the childrens museum station 
made it clear to mta officials in meetings this week that it is the 
companys responsibility for paying an estimated 4 million to 
remove what has already been built 
the company had constructed 12 concrete columns and some 7000 
square feet of platform at the museum station it said it invested 
10 million in the project 
construction on the system began in 1988 but was halted in june 
as the company began reassessing the project 
skeptics had said from the projects inception that it would 
carry few riders between the cashman field convention center and 
ballpark complex and downtown and would have to be part of a bigger 
system linked with the airport and strip to succeed

authorities in the croatian state 
moved friday to head off an ethnic insurgency with a promise not to 
trample the human and political rights of serbs 
but a proposed resolution demanded the immediate disbanding of 
armed vigilante groups set up by serbs who are the largest 
yugoslav ethnic group but make up only 11 percent of croatias 5 
million people 
serbs charge croatian president franjo tudjmans new 
reformminded government with fostering croatian nationalism at 
their expense 
the state parliament dominated by tudjmans centerright 
croatian democratic union on friday was discussing a draft 
resolution apparently meant to ease ethnic tensions 
it said the croatian leadership is determined to ensure all 
human political and national rights for croats and serbs at 
least to the extent that such rights are guaranteed by democratic 
nations in europe and america the resolution also called for 
authorities to undertake decisive political and criminal 
sanctions against the organizers of political violence banditry 
and terrorism 
croatians who are roman catholic dominate the western half of 
yugoslavia while orthodox serbs form the majority in the south of 
the country the two ethnic groups have been rivals since they were 
united within yugoslavia in 1918 
tensions flared late last week after croatias serbs announced a 
planned referendum on autonomy for their region in southwestern 
croatia 
the croatian government prohibited the plebiscite but thousands 
of serbs defied the ban and voted over the weekend although the 
atmosphere was confrontational no serious trouble was reported 
tudjman whose party overwhelmingly won the first multiparty 
election in croatia in more than 50 years blames the dispute on 
the communist government of serbia the largest yugoslav republic 
he said serbs in croatia were insufficiently represented in the 
state government because their leaders decided to boycott 
parliament ratko licina the sole deputy of the serb party 
attending the friday session said his party would continue to 
boycott the legislature which he decribed as undemocratic 
tudjman also announced leadership changes including the ouster 
of stipe suvar a longtime communist who was the states 
representative on yugoslavias eightman presidency he would be 
replaced by croatian premier stipe mesic who was jailed for two 
years in the mid1970s for anticommunism

the us economy grew at a sluggish annual 
rate of 12 percent from april through june the government said 
friday in a report that showed widespread economic weakness even 
before the persian gulf crisis heightened fears of an impending 
recession 
the commerce department report showed that the gross national 
product the total output of goods and services grew for the fifth 
consecutive quarter at a pace below 2 percent 
the report which showed no change in the overall gnp figure 
from a preliminary snapshot released a month ago was a 
disappointment to many economists who had been looking for at least 
a small upward revision 
the report showed that the countrys trade deficit worsened in 
the spring although at a slower pace than originally believed 
while business spending on plant and equipment expansion and 
housing construction both dropped sharply 
only a big rise in business inventories growth in government 
spending and a weak increase in consumer purchases kept the overall 
gnp number from being negative 
many economists believe that the second quarter weakness is 
likely to be exacerbated by the mideast tensions which have sent 
oil prices surging by 50 percent and badly shaken consumer 
confidence according to recent surveys 
we dont have a recession in the forecast yet but it will be 
a close call said bob diely a senior economist at northern 
trust co in chicago the outbreak of shooting in the middle east 
or some other jolt to consumer confidence could tear up the current 
forecast very quickly 
some of the more pessimistic economists however believe that a 
downturn is imminent regardless of whether mideast hostilities 
escalate 
they said the current expansion since the 198182 recession has 
already lasted a peacetime record of nearly eight years and has 
been exhibiting extreme sluggishness for more than a year 
this is a case of downward momentum being intensified by 
events in the middle east said allen sinai chief economist of 
the boston co the economy is caving and there is nothing out 
there to offset the weakness 
bruce steinberg a senior forecaster at merrill lynch the new 
york brokerage firm said every time over the past 40 years that 
we have had growth this slow for a year the us economy was 
either entering a recession or already in a recession 
the bush administration however viewed the gnp performance 
with far less pessimism noting that the revisions showed more 
balance because of a smaller rise in inventories than the initial 
report last month 
at a briefing in kennebunkport me white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said the gnp report confirmed that the economy 
was indeed still growing although he stressed the need for the 
administration to reach agreement with congress on ways to control 
the spiraling budget deficit 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who flew to maine for a 
meeting friday 
with president bush on the budget negotiations recently 
predicted that the turmoil in the mideast and the accompanying jump 
in oil prices could slash the weak 15 percent average growth in 
the first half of the year in half down to a rate of 075 percent 
in the last two quarters of 1990 
the administration has been pressuring the federal reserve to 
insure that growth does not go any lower by reducing interest rates 
as a way of stimulating the economy 
while fed policy makers met behind closed doors on tuesday to 
review monetary policy analysts said they could detect no signs 
that the central bank was heeding the administrations pleas 
private economists said it was unlikely that the fed would 
relent and lower interest rates now that higher energy prices 
threatened to kick off another price spiral 
for the second quarter a consumer price index tied to the gnp 
showed prices rising at an annual rate of 39 percent this was 
unchanged from a month ago but it was a significant improvement 
from a 66 percent jump in prices in the first three months of the 
year 
however analysts are predicting inflation will worsen in coming 
months as the impact of higher oil prices is felt 
inflation and recession fears have roiled financial markets in 
recent weeks although the stock market steadied somewhat on friday 
after a big selloff the day before 
after the dow jones industrial average had lost nearly 77 points 
on thursday it was up just over 7 points in late afternoon trading 
friday 
the commerce department also reported friday that aftertax 
profits earned by american corporations slipped 02 percent in the 
second quarter compared to a tiny 05 percent increase in the 
first quarter it was the worst showing since a 59 percent decline 
in the third quarter of 1989 
economists said the weakness reflected the overall weak economy 
and predicted even more pressure on profits if the economy slides 
into a recession 
the second quarter gnp which left the economy growing at an 
inflation adjusted total of 416 trillion was the weakest showing 
since a barely discernible 03 percent advance in the fourth 
quarter of 1989

iraq is violating international laws on the 
rights of diplomats that date to biblical times and are considered 
basic to relations between nations legal experts said friday 
iraqs attempt to close the embassies in occupied kuwait has 
simply no legal authority said international lawyer david 
scheffer of the carnegie endowment for international peace 
the detention of 100 american diplomats and dependents trying to 
leave kuwait by way of baghdad is an even more blatant rejection of 
international norms legalists said 
you dont interfere with the freedom of mobility of 
diplomats said david koplow law professor at georgetown law 
school thats one of the fundamental principles 
iraq is a signatory to both the 1961 and 1963 vienna conventions 
on diplomatic relations and consular affairs agreements that 
explicitly spell out such areas as diplomatic immunity and the 
extraterritoriality of embassies 
those conventions say a nation cannot arbitrarily close the 
diplomatic mission of another country unless it first breaks 
relations with that country it may not expel diplomats unless it 
declares them persona non grata iraq has done neither 
david steigman assistant dean in the georgetown school of 
foreign service said iraq may claim that the embassies must go 
because kuwait no longer exists but in eyes of the world there 
is still an independent kuwait 
the principle of diplomatic immunity under which diplomats 
have freedom of movement and are free from arrest or taxation has 
its roots in biblical times 
king hanun of the ammonites who lived not far from presentday 
iraq accused king davids envoys of spying shaved off half their 
beards and stripped them david was so incensed by this diplomatic 
impropriety that he went to war 
the formal laws of diplomacy began to evolve with the 
establishment of the first permanent diplomatic missions in the 
italian citystates of the 15th century and were codified in the 
1815 congress of vienna 
scheffer said iraq by detaining american civilians and 
diplomats also has broken a commerce and navigation treaty with 
the united states that guarantees the safe transit of people and 
goods through the countries and the 1949 geneva convention 
protecting civilians during wartime 
if iraq declared war on the united states which it has not 
it would have the right under the geneva convention to intern 
american citizens in the interests of national security 
the united states interned german and japanese nationals during 
world war ii and even restricted the movements of diplomats until 
exchanges for american diplomats could be arranged 
but the geneva convention also states explicitly that hostile 
nationals may not be used as shields to protect military 
installations iraq has begun moving westerners to facilities that 
would be targeted in a military attack on the country 
there are precedents for closing embassies in an occupied 
country the soviet union shut down the embassies in lithuania and 
other baltic states after taking over those countries in 1939 and 
1940 
foreign missions closed their doors days after nazi germanys 
1938 invasion of austria 
we still feel today this was a grave mistake said philipp 
hoyos charge daffaires of the austrian embassy in washington 
we had the impression no one was interested in our independence 
its something we resent 
there has also been the occasional takeover of embassies the 
bestknown being the seizure of the us embassy in iran in 1979 
and the holding of 52 american hostages for 444 days 
us troops forced their way into the residence of the 
ambassador of nicaragua during the us invasion of panama in 
december president bush said that violation was a screwup

moderate southern baptists voted friday to take 
control of some church offerings usually managed by the 
denominations fundamentalist leaders 
the architects of the alternative funding plan insisted 
however that the vote was not a prelude to a split by moderates 
from the southern baptist convention the group the worlds 
largest protestant denomination with 149 million members has 
been immersed in a dispute between moderates and conservatives for 
more than a decade 
were all southern baptists here were still southern 
baptists but we have created a dual alignment so we can support 
missions we believe in said the rev jimmy allen a moderate who 
is president of faith amp families ministries inc in fort worth 
texas 
this is a determination to support things we believe in and 
to not support things we dont believe in 
the rev david sapp who presented the funding proposal to about 
2500 southern baptists attending a threeday meeting in atlanta 
said the moderates were forced to come up with the plan because 
they have been stripped of a voice in deciding how denomination 
collections are allocated 
this is the first time in baptist history that a group of 
people have been systematically excluded from a voice in how funds 
are spent said sapp pastor of the first baptist church of 
chamblee 
the funding plan approved by a show of hands would be 
implemented on an interim basis beginning in october and refined 
into a permanent system at a meeting next spring it establishes 
the baptist cooperative mission program to which moderate churches 
could send money they normally give to the convention for such 
national programs as seminaries and missions 
leaders of the moderate faction would not say how much money 
might come through the new system 
conservatives who believe in the inerrancy of the bible and say 
those who disagree are not true christians have gained increasing 
control of the southern baptist convention over the last 12 years 
moderates who advocate local church autonomy and a greater role 
for women and minorities say the conservatives are running the 
denomination with an iron fist 
officials of the convention could not be reached immediately for 
comment friday a woman reached at the convention headquarters in 
nashville tenn said the spokesman was out of the office 
those who helped draft the moderates funding plan denied it was 
an attempt to undermine the southern baptist convention they said 
their differences are political and not spiritual 
they said the system would merely ensure that money donated from 
moderate churches does not pay for programs that exclude moderate 
input 
they fundamentalists will accept responsibility for funding 
their own agenda said the rev alfred ayscue pastor at calvary 
baptist church in mount airy nc 
to say we are dangling money before them is not what this 
meeting is about ayscue said we are taking the money and 
making it reflect the principles we have 
the moderate leaders stressed that no money would be withheld 
from missionaries in the field 
allen declined to identify which programs the moderates might 
refuse to fund though he said we dont like what happened at the 
baptist press 
the governing board of the southern baptist convention recently 
fired two top editors of the baptist press the sbcs news service 
after they were accused of producing reports biased against 
fundamentalists 
some participants in fridays meeting cautioned against going 
too far with the funding program the rev bill sherman pastor of 
woodmont baptist church in nashville said in the minds of many 
people this is a seismic step we can go no further than the 
people who give us the money will allow 
the meeting is scheduled to conclude saturday after an interim 
steering committee for the group is elected

the united states is providing 1 million and 
500 tents to help jordan deal with a crush of refugees from iraq 
and kuwait the state department said friday 
we recognize the burden on jordan caused by tens of thousands 
of persons who are fleeing iraq and kuwait said richard boucher 
the departments deputy spokesman 
boucher said some of the money will be made available to the 
us embassy in amman the jordanian capital to help meet urgent 
humanitarian needs in and near the city boucher had said 
thursday that the embassy released 25000 to help jordan care for 
the refugees and the united states had provided 18000 prepackaged 
meals for the evacuees 
the state department also is engaged in discussions with the 
international committee of the red cross which in turn is working 
with the jordanian red crescent in the border area where the 
immediate needs are the greatest boucher said 
he said other governments also are providing humanitarian aid 
and the united states is working with the united nations and other 
international organizations to provide additional assistance in 
the most effective and coordinated manner 
the united states is certainly prepared to do more as the 
needs require baker said

a judge friday denied bail for a doctor 
abducted in mexico so he could stand trial in the united states in 
the torturedeath of us drug enforcement administration agent 
enrique camarena 
camarena and his pilot alfredo zavala avelar were tortured and 
killed in guadalajara in 1985 nearly 50 people have been arrested 
in connection with the case in mexico and the united states and 
several have been convicted 
dr humberto alvarez machain was charged with violent crimes in 
aid of racketeering conspiracy kidnap and murder prosecutors 
said he administered drugs to keep camarena alive while he was 
being tortured prior to death 
the alleged kidnapping of the guadalajara gynecologist on april 
2 has strained relations between the united states and mexico 
mexican officials including president carlos salinas de gortari 
have called the operation a violation of their national sovereignty 
alvarez was ordered detained without bail by us district judge 
edward rafeedie who said he was a flight risk 
when alvarez asked for bail he told rafeedie i want to 
assure you that i would under no circumstances return to mexico 
i just want you to have a little trust in me so that i can 
prove to you that im innocent 
the judge answered unfortunately it is not the subjective 
intentions that govern you have to look at the objective factors 
i regret that the defendant must be held in custody pending 
appeal 
the judge ruled aug 10 that alvarez was kidnapped illegally and 
should be returned to mexico but prosecutors appealed to the 9th 
us circuit court of appeal which issued an emergency order late 
thursday to stay rafeedies decision 
alvarez was in the courtroom during fridays halfhour bail 
hearing us authorities said in their appeal that they would have 
virtually no chance of getting alvarez back in custody if he 
was repatriated 
rafeedie said earlier this month that the united states abducted 
alvarez in violation of an extradition treaty with mexico that the 
kidnapping was an offense to mexicos sovereignty and that his 
court lacked the jurisdiction to try the physician 
if convicted he could be sentenced to life in prison 
in hearings on the case last spring the dea acknowledged it had 
paid 20000 plus 6000 a week in expenses to people who brought 
alvarez to the united states to face charges 
prosecutors said the slayings of camarena and avelar were 
revenge for dea raids on marijuana and cocaine plantations that 
cost the drug barons 5 billion in profits 
the 31yearold camarena was kidnapped off a guadalajara street 
in february 1985 testimony showed the agent was tortured and 
interrogated by drug lords before being slain along with avelar

bad weather and improper flight preparation 
contributed to the plane crash that killed rep mickey leland 
dtexas and 15 others last year in ethiopia a report issued 
friday said 
the ethiopian civil aviation authority said the pilots erred by 
pushing too far and flying into an area of bad weather at a very 
low altitude 
leland who was chairman of the house select committee on 
hunger was flying from the ethiopian capital of addis ababa to 
fugnido a refugee camp on the sudanese border to inspect relief 
efforts three congressional staffers also died in the crash 
the plane ran into a mountainside more than an hour after 
takeoff aug 7 1989 the flight crew may have failed to maintain 
visual ground contact and unknowingly collided with a mountain 
the agency concluded 
the crash destroyed an emergency transmitter on the plane that 
could have helped rescuers the wreckage wasnt found for a week 
the plane a 1980 twin otter had no defects and crew members 
reported no problems during the flight the report said 
low clouds and rain dotted the intended route the report said 
the flight crew deviated from a planned altitude of 12500 feet 
because of bad weather 
witnesses who saw the plane 25 miles and 7 miles before it 
crashed told authorities it was flying below the clouds at a low 
altitude 
the report suggests the crew which was familiar with the route 
was unable to follow the path of a river because of scattered rain 
showers investigators could not determine whether the pilot or 
copilot was flying the plane when it crashed 
the tight flight schedule may have pressured the crew to fly in 
bad weather the report said organizers including leland and the 
crew discussed weatherrelated delays it said 
the long delay on the one hand and the importance of the 
mission on the other may have created undue pressure and uneasiness 
on the flight crew the report said 
leland was making his second trip to the border region to focus 
attention on the hunger needs of sudanese whose homes had been 
ruined by civil war 
the ethiopian agencys report was released by the national 
transportation safety board a canadian safety expert also 
participated because the aircraft was built in canada

united states is increasing its military buildup

than doubled averaging 20000 calls a day since the invasion

encounter busy circuit conditions requiring them to call again

reservists will step in to ease the 
shortage at two of the nations biggest naval hospitals which were 
drained of doctors and nurses when the hospital ships comfort and 
mercy sailed for the middle east 
we should start getting reservists early next week said 
tami begasse spokeswoman at oakland naval hospital a 225bed 
facility in the foothills above oakland 
we need them to backfill the people we lost when the mercy 
left our services are down about 60 percent begasse said friday 
the pentagon announced on thursday that about 46700 reserves 
will be called to active duty over the next five weeks president 
bush has the authority to call up as many as 200000 reserves for 
up to 180 days without declaring a national emergency 
oakland naval hospital known as oak knoll usually has about 
280 doctors and 150 nurses begasse said about 80 members of the 
medical corps 16 dental officers and more than 2000 other 
staffers also work there she said 
about 800 hospital staffers sailed aboard the mercy when it 
departed oakland on aug 16 others were expected to be flown to 
the ship before it reached the persian gulf said robert borden 
military sealift command spokesman 
at bethesda naval hospital in maryland spokesman lt cdr 
william clyde said 1100 uniformed medical personnel were on the 
comfort which left baltimore on aug 11 or deployed to other 
middle east assignments 
before the deployment bethesda had a hospital staff of 3500 
the hospital expected hundreds of reservists to fill the gap 
but did not know exactly when they would arrive said clyde 
all elective surgery has been deferred and admissions are 
limited to active duty emergency cases clyde said but walter reed 
army hospital and other hospitals are taking up some of the slack 
the number of patients was reduced from 350 to 150 and some 
wards were closed but outpatient clinics were busy clyde said 
in oakland the mercy developed steering problems before the 
ship set sail and the delay gave 290 medical staffers the chance to 
go back to the oakland hospital after administrators realized it 
was critically understaffed 
the hospital had been reduced to inpatient labor and delivery 
emergency room service and two 36bed wards some patients were 
transferred to other hospitals begasse said 
were looking forward to having the help begasse said the 
hospital which previously had an average inpatient census of 170 
per day is handling only an average of 90 per day he said

a subliminal message of do it exists on an 
album by the british rock band judas priest but it did not cause 
two young fans to kill themselves a judge ruled friday 
washoe district judge jerry carr whitehead said that while 
messages can be found on the bands 1978 stained class album 
they were not intentional and did not cause the fans to form a 
suicide pact 
whitehead said the words do it on the song better by you 
better than me were the result of a chance combination of 
sounds but constituted a subliminal message nonetheless 
our immediate reaction is obviously one of great relief 
said rob halford the bands lead singer its a great day for 
judas priest 
speaking with the associated press from an undisclosed location 
in mexico halford said we simply just want to get on with what 
we do playing rock n roll and heavy metal music 
i am pleased with the result on the basic issues of the case 
i think we were completely vindicated said defense lawyer 
suellen fulstone 
the defense maintained that the do it sounds were a huff of 
breath by halford combined with the sounds of guitars 
but in clearing the band of any liability in the case whitehead 
said that codefendant cbs records refused to properly comply with 
his order to find the original multitrack recordings of other 
songs on the stained class album he ordered the company to pay 
40000 to the plaintiffs attorneys to reimburse them for the cost 
of bringing the lawsuit 
he said the defaults were not caused by the courtroom lawyers 
but by inhouse counsel of cbs 
whitehead added that even if the master tapes had been found 
the court does not believe that the ultimate outcome of the trial 
would have been any different 
the families of the two suicide victims sued the band and cbs 
records claiming messages hidden in the crashing music touted 
satanism and promoted suicide 
raymond belknap 18 died from a single blast from a shotgun 
held in his mouth dec 23 1985 james vance then 20 blew away 
the lower portion of his face but survived three more years before 
his death on thanksgiving day 1988 of complications from his 
injuries and a reaction to medications 
attorneys for the families sought 62 million in damages at the 
conclusion of a fourweek trial 
they said the subliminal message do it and purported 
backward phrases glorifying death spurred the shootings 
the defense maintained said the alleged blasphemous phrases were 
phonetic flukes given credibility only by the power of 
suggestion 
the judge reluctantly agreed saying the power of suggestion 
may serve to make the listener think he hears a certain phrase when 
the singing is played backwards even though he probably would not 
have perceived the phrase without the power of suggestion 
while attorneys for the families raised grave suspicions in 
the mind of the court whitehead said there was no credible 
evidence that the messages were intentionally placed or that they 
could be perceived even if they were 
im a little bit disappointed about that halford said 
theres never been a song written by judas priest that could be 
conceived to condone suicide in any nature 
the defense blamed the youths alcohol and substance abuse 
family violence and antisocial personalities for their suicides 
the youths allegedly shot themselves after spending several 
hours drinking beer smoking marijuana and listening to the judas 
priest album 
vivian lynch representing vances family conceded during trial 
that there were other factors in the youths lives that made them 
prone to suicide but she said it was the music that compelled them 
to shoot themselves against their own will 
the judge disagreed 
there exist other factors which explain the conduct of the 
deceased independent of the subliminal stimuli he said

federal reserve policymakers concluded in 
july that inflation remained high enough to maintain current 
interest rates despite a relatively slow economy records 
released friday show 
the staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that 
the economy would expand over the remainder of 1990 at around the 
rate estimated for the first half of the year and at a slightly 
faster pace in 1991 minutes of the july meeting said 
but 10 days later the central bank did lower the federal funds 
rate the rate banks charge for overnight loans from 825 
percent to 8 percent 
however the fed said the action was intended to offset overly 
cautious lending practices by the nations banks and was not 
implemented because of a weakening economy 
in testimony before congress in july fed chairman alan 
greenspan said the central bank projected a 1990 growth rate of 15 
percent to 2 percent slightly slower than the bush administration 
forecast of 22 percent 
since then however the commerce department reported the 
economy slowed from a 17 percent annual rate of growth in the 
first quarter of 1990 to 12 percent in the second and there have 
been signs of further weakness as the economy entered the second 
half of the year 
and the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait has driven the price of 
oil above 30 a barrel both fueling inflationary pressures and 
creating further concern that the fragile economy may be pushed 
into a recession 
the federal open market committee met again tuesday but 
decisions made then will not be announced for six weeks 
however economists believe that the committee voted to continue 
current rates as a hedge against further inflation stemming from 
the middle east crisis 
the committee had pushed shortterm rates up beginning in 1988 
to slow the economy and thus curb inflation but as economic growth 
weakened the policymakers began nudging shortterm rates down 
starting in june 1989 
the bush administration and many economists have been urging the 
committee to permit interest rates to fall further to stimulate the 
economy 
the information reviewed at this july 23 meeting suggested 
that economic activity was continuing to expand but at a relatively 
slow pace the minutes said 
committee members generally saw sustained but subdued growth 
in economic activity as a reasonable expectation for the next 
several quarters they continued 
at the same time the minutes said that while prices had 
moderated since earlier in the year there was little evidence of 
significant change in the trend rate of inflation 
the minutes reported the members also discussed two special 
factors that added to the uncertainties bearing on the economic 
outlook the timing and extent of any reduction in the federal 
budget deficit and tightened credit 
at the end of the meeting the members voted 110 to maintain 
current interest rates vice chairman manuel johnson who is 
resigning did not attend the meeting 
the committee is made up of the seven fed governors and five of 
the 12 presidents of fed regional banks it meets in secret eight 
times a year to formulate monetary policy minutes are released 
about six weeks later a few days after the next meeting

the government imposed 
emergency measures friday on black townships hit by fierce ethnic 
fighting and ordered in more police and soldiers to try to end 
strife that has claimed more than 500 lives 
african national congress leader nelson mandela later met with 
president fw de klerk mandela said negotiations with the 
government would continue despite what he called an unnecessary 
move declaring the townships around johannesburg unrest areas 
we are the architects and we are determined they the talks 
will succeed he said 
in an earlier speech de klerk said the government would not 
permit the country to deteriorate into anarchy 
law and order minister adriaan vlok announced the emergency 
measures in pretoria on a day of little serious fighting in the 
townships police reported finding six bodies in various townships 
from previous fighting 
in kagiso township police used razor wire shotguns and tear 
gas to keep rival war bands apart a police spokeswoman said some 
fighting broke out and a 4yearold child was seriously injured 
when hit by an axe 
police reinforcements were sent to the township the spokeswoman 
said 
most other areas were reported calm 
fridays announcement came almost two weeks after political and 
tribal clashes between zulus loyal to the conservative inkatha 
political movement and xhosas most of them anc supporters flared 
it is in the interest of south africa and all its inhabitants 
that further bloodshed disorder and chaos be prevented at all 
costs vlok said 
he noted that black leaders had called for police to stop the 
township violence but said the government had not consulted the 
anc about the steps 
vlok announced 
the number of police and soldiers in the emergency areas would 
be drastically increased 
people in the unrest areas would not be allowed to carry a wide 
range of weapons at public meetings the banned weapons included 
firebombs spears battle axes garden forks knives and machetes 
the measures would last for three months but could be extended 
should these measures not have the required effect i shall 
not hesitate to institute stricter measures he said 
vlok told journalists the crackdown would not restrict reporting 
in the affected areas as a nationwide state of emergency imposed 
in 1985 did the government lifted the emergency on june 8 in all 
areas except for natal province because of continued black 
factional fighting there 
the anc demanded lifting of the nationwide state of emergency as 
a condition of formal talks with the whiteled government on a new 
constitution 
mandela who leaves saturday on a sevenday trip to norway 
libya and algeria said after meeting with de klerk that the new 
measures amounted to a state of emergency in the affected areas 
he said the township trouble appeared rooted in the migrant 
worker hostels where blacks from tribal homelands live while 
working in the johannesburg area much of the fighting has pitted 
hostel dwellers against township residents 
mandela said the anc told vlok last week that police should 
monitor the hostels prevent armed people from leaving them and 
also stop area residents from attacking hostel dwellers 
in kagiso on friday youths set fire to five factory buildings 
causing thousands of dollars in damage police said 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu visited the township and heard 
angry residents demand that the hostels be torn down 
business day newspaper reported the kagiso violence caused 
residents to stay home instead of going to work at the neighboring 
chamdor industrial area tom wilson a chamdor manager told the 
newspaper half the workers were absent and production was down 
about 50 percent 
police also clashed friday in vosloorus township with 
stonethrowing protesters who tried to block streets with burning 
tires and other debris 
the fighting has continued despite pleas from government and 
black leaders for peace and a strong police and army presence in 
the townships it is considered the most serious violence since 
nationwide unrest in the mid1980s 
the anc blames inkatha for spreading black factional fighting 
from the eastern natal province to the townships near johannesburg 
inkatha accuses the anc of trying to wipe out any competition for 
power among black opposition groups 
both groups oppose apartheid the system of segregation and 
white dominance but they differ on the shape of a future south 
africa

two university of colorado students who 
were tracking bighorn sheep in southwest colorado stumbled upon the 
virtually untouched ruins of a lost indian village more than 1100 
years old 
the 6acre mountain sheep village as the site is being called 
probably had about 200 structures and may have housed 150 to 200 
anasazi indians as early as the year 850 ad said kristie 
arrington an archaeologist for the bureau of land management 
the students dave merritt and chris kuzawa struggled over the 
rim of a cliff and found mounds and vertical slabs of sandstone 
sticking out of the ground at the site by a forest of ponderosa 
pine 
we were just hiking around and we found it said merritt 
the slabs are the foundations of structures made of poles brush 
and adobe 
it was pretty spectacular kuzawa said once we realized 
what it was we started to look around we stayed until dusk we 
knew we were on to something pretty big 
the discovery is significant because the site is on the north 
side of the dolores river which wraps around it on three sides 
previously anasazi ruins have been found only south of the river 
the anasazi or ancient ones lived in the four corners 
area their bestknown ruins are the cliff dwellings in mesa verde 
national park in southwestern colorado the newly discovered site 
is about 60 miles northwest of mesa verde not far from the utah 
border 
pottery fragments discovered by the students date the site about 
300 years before the height of mesa verde cliff dwellings 
arrington said the people of mountain sheep village may have 
traded big game and timber with other villages in exchange for food 
and pottery she said tools associated with game procurement and 
processing such as arrowheads scrapers and knives have been 
found on the ground 
local people hunting may have been through there and one area 
shows evidence that it had been potted a little bit said 
arrington but its fairly unusual that it hadnt been recorded 
and documented before now 
potting is a term used to describe the illegal digging for 
indian pots 
merritt and kuzawa were working out of the dolores canyon 
research center on a federal archaeology project this summer the 
project involves tracking desert bighorn sheep and river otters 
conducting an inventory of water invertebrates in the river and 
probing historic mining sites 
arrington said blm officials will have to decide how to manage 
the site it needs mapping we would like to get an idea of 
what was going on there day by day he said no massive excavation 
is planned

the bush administration on friday leveled a 
barrage of accusations and protests at iraq as troops blocked the 
us embassy in kuwait and more than 100 american diplomats and 
dependents were detained in baghdad 
the iraqi news agency later carried a government announcement 
that the dependents of foreign diplomats would be permitted to 
leave baghdad but us officials said iraq had not notified 
washington and were unlikely to on the moslem holy day of the week 
this seems to be a credible report and if it turns out to be 
true we will begin to move people out tomorrow a us official 
told the associated press 
while president bush pondered his next moves and one of saddam 
husseins deadlines for closing the embassy passed white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater denounced the iraqi leader for 
enveloping americans and other foreigners in a pattern of 
harassment 
richard boucher the state department spokesman accused iraq of 
an outrageous breach of international law in preventing the 
diplomats and family members including about 30 children from 
leaving baghdad after they had been promised safe passage 
boucher called it another stark example of iraqi duplicity 
after the americans had left kuwait in a 33car caravan the 
iraqis invoked new regulations to keep them in baghdad at the end 
of their 19hour journey boucher said 
the regulations which were relayed from iraqi foreign minister 
tarik aziz to the iraqi ambassador here prohibit the departure 
from iraq of personnel from foreign embassies in kuwait that stay 
open in spite of saddams order the state department spokesman 
said 
iraq had given two deadlines noon and midnight kuwait time 
for the missions to close boucher said that up to a dozen soldiers 
appeared at the us embassy about 11 am 3 am edt 
an embassy vehicle was stopped as it tried to enter the 
compound one person inside a private us citizen was permitted 
to leave boucher said 
iraqi ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat informed david mack a 
deputy assistant secretary of state of the new regulations in a 
middleofthenight telephone call 
boucher said ambassador nathaniel howell and his staff of about 
10 would stay keeping in touch with the 2500 americans trapped in 
kuwait as much as circumstances allow they were keeping 
telephone conversations short because iraqis were listening in the 
us official said 
iraqi guards had stood outside the embassy since bush retaliated 
against saddams aug 2 invasion of kuwait by organizing an 
economic boycott of iraq and dispatching a massive us land and 
sea force to the persian gulf area 
but the troops that appeared friday were the first to move into 
position to block entry and exit from the embassy boucher said 
fitzwater briefing reporters at kennebunkport maine as bush 
huddled with brent scowcroft his national security adviser said 
he was not aware of any confrontation between the iraqi soldiers 
and the americans inside 
they have not made any move against the embassy or intruded in 
any fashion the presidents spokesman said 
boucher said at least 20 other countries were refusing to 
abandon their embassies while a few had decided to close 
i think what is clear to us is that iraq has tried in a most 
callous way to barter the security of foreign citizens for 
concessions on the presence of diplomatic missions in kuwait and 
that most countries are resisting this blatant violation of 
diplomatic practice and international law he said 
the americans who fled to iraq were to be evacuated to turkey 
fitzwater said 
he called their detention another troublesome element in the 
overall pattern of harassment and hostagetaking kinds of 
activities that saddam hussein has been engaged in 
asked what howell and his staff might do if the iraqi soldiers 
applied force fitzwater said should he be subject to that he 
would have to act accordingly 
thousands of american troops and an armada of warships are 
within range of iraq and kuwait but bush gave no hint how he might 
respond if saddam attempted to overrun the embassy 
marine guards were withdrawn in the scaling down of the us 
diplomatic corps in kuwait city officials said their primary 
mission would have been to dispose of sensitive files and could not 
have withstood a massive assault in any event 
even with the mounting crisis bush and secretary of state james 
a baker iii mixed vacation with a long series of consultations 
bush went boating thursday and played golf friday morning with 
two of his sons george and john 
baker while remaining at his ranch in wyoming spoke by 
telephone twice with bush and also talked to foreign ministers 
eduard a shevardnadze of the soviet union and hansdietrich 
genscher of west germany

nasa is investigating the possibility 
that magellan keeps losing touch with earth because its braking 
rocket might not have fully separated after the spacecraft reached 
venus engineers said friday 
meanwhile nasa released new photographs from magellan that 
showed a lavafilled 20milewide meteorite crater on the planet 
magellan project manager tony spear said another theory for the 
lapses in radio contact is that the braking rocket pulled some 
cables off or burned some cables as it was jettisoned when the 
spacecraft went into orbit around venus on aug 10 
the braking rocket which slowed magellan so it could enter 
orbit was supposed to separate nine hours later and most signs 
are that it did so or at least started to do so spear said during 
a news conference at nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
i believe personally the solid rocket motor is far away and 
not bumping the craft he said 
but the possibility it didnt must be considered said frank 
mckinney program manager for martin marietta corp which built 
magellan 
its a possibility were investigating said spacecraft 
system engineer john slonski 
two hours after the news conference ended the laboratorys 
public relations office issued a statement saying there was 
currently no doubt the separation was complete spokesmen 
refused to elaborate when asked to explain the contradiction 
between that statement and those made by slonski during the news 
conference 
even if the rocket had not completely separated it wouldnt 
prevent magellan from conducting its 744 million mission to use 
radar to make maps and pictures spear said mapping is likely to 
start no earlier than midseptember two weeks later than planned 
he said 
magellan first lost radio contact with controllers on aug 16 
until engineers identify and fix the problem that cut the radio 
link spear said i think its likely to happen again 
if so engineers are ready with new computer commands to kick 
start magellans automatic safety systems and make the spacecraft 
reestablish contact with earth immediately spear said 
pictures released friday including a computerprocessed 
threedimensional view showed a meteorite impact crater that has a 
very smooth floor and a central peak 
the smooth floor indicates the crater was flooded by volcanic 
lava either because the meteorite punched through venus hot thin 
crust or because the impact created cracks that let lava ooze into 
the crater at some later time said magellan chief scientist steve 
saunders he said he favors the second theory 
the crater first was observed by the soviet venera 15 and 16 
spacecraft in the mid1980s their pictures were 10 times less 
detailed and couldnt determine if it was an impact crater or 
created purely by volcanic eruption saunders said 
he said the crater is relatively young geologically 100 million 
to 150 million years old it is named after soviet sculptor anna 
golubkina who lived from 1864 to 1927 
other pictures from magellan showed intense venusquake 
faulting lava flows and a network of intersecting ridges and 
valleys 
scientists also displayed a threeminute videotape assembled 
from still pictures it provides a magellaneye view of venus as 
the spacecraft swept over the planet 
contact with magellan was lost for more than 14 hours starting 
aug 16 and for 17 hours starting tuesday night 
my heart cant stand this 17hour loss of signal again 
spear said there are moments of terror and of great happiness 
after we recovered the signal 
engineers also are considering the possibility the 
communications failures were caused by problems with magellans 
computer hardware or programs or the unlikely chance magellan is 
being affected by previously unknown electrical fields around venus 
possibly were making a scientific discovery but this is a 
hard way of doing it spear said 
evidence suggests that during its second radio outage magellan 
wobbled back and forth at a high rate using 57 pounds of fuel 
as its thrusters kept firing slonski said that still leaves 251 
pounds of fuel far more than needed to keep magellan in orbit for 
years longer than originally planned the spacecraft used much less 
thruster fuel than expected when it slipped into orbit 
magellan was launched from the shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989 
and traveled a looping 948 millionmile route to venus

irish hostage brian keenan was freed by 
his lebanese captors on friday after more than four years in 
captivity the fifth western hostage released in five months he 
was reported en route to damascus 
the irish government confirmed in dublin a report from irans 
official islamic republic news agency that the 39yearold teacher 
was free and irish foreign minister gerry collins said i can 
tell you brian is now on his way from beirut to damascus 
iran which has considerable influence among shiite moslem 
fundamentalist groups in lebanon said it had worked for months to 
help secure the release 
a shadowy group calling itself the organization of the islamic 
dawn announced the release in a terse typewritten arabic statement 
delivered to the beirut newspaper an nahar 
we have decided to release irish hostage brian keenan it 
said this was done at exactly 9 pm beirut time 2 pm edt 
no group had claimed responsibility for kidnapping keenan from 
the time he was abducted until he was freed 
an informed syrian source said friday night that keenan was in 
syrian hands but would not appear in public and until saturday 
when he would be handed over to the irish foreign minister 
the source who spoke on condition he not be further identified 
would not say if keenan was spending the night in damascus or 
somewhere in syriancontrolled lebanon 
almost all hostages released in lebanon have been handed to 
syrian officers there and escorted to damascus overland a trip 
through winding mountainous roads that takes 2 to 3 hours 
thirteen westerners are still believed held by extremist moslem 
groups in lebanon six americans four britons two west germans 
and an italian most have been held more than three years and 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press has been held since march 16 1985 
the statement friday from the organization of islamic dawn was 
just the second it has made a statement on hostages on april 30 
it said it was freeing us hostage frank reed the malden 
massborn educator was released that day 
hostage robert polhill of new york was freed on april 22 and 
two swiss red cross workers elio erriquez and emmanuel christen 
were freed this month 
reed held 3 years said later he had been with keenan reeds 
wife fifi said friday that her husband would fly to ireland later 
to meet with keenan 
in dublin a sister of keenan elaine spence burst into tears 
of relief and joy at the news of her brothers release she and 
keenans other sister brenda gillham had driven there from 
belfast friday as speculation grew stronger that their brother 
after many disappointments would finally go free 
the sisters were to fly to syria early saturday with collins to 
greet keenan the irish foreign minister said in dublin 
keenan was kidnapped by gunmen on april 11 1986 in west beirut 
while walking to the american university in beirut where he worked 
as a teacher of english he was born in belfast and was traveling 
on an irish passport but is also a british citizen 
irna had reported thursday that a european hostage would be 
released soon on friday irans deputy foreign minister mahmoud 
vaezi told the tehran times newspaper keenan would be released and 
said we are thankful to the islamic groups in lebanon who once 
more showed their goodwill toward the west 
vaezi said the release resulted from several months of efforts 
of the iranian officials and islamic groups in lebanon 
we expect that the west will take similar steps for the 
freedom of lebanese prisoners and iranian hostages such a move 
will make our efforts for the freedom of a hostages easier 
iran has linked the fate of western hostages to that of four 
iranians kidnapped by christian lebanese forces militiamen in july 
1982 the four are widely believed to have been killed but iranian 
leaders have stressed they would use their influence to help free 
western hostages in exchange for help in freeing the iranians 
keenan spent most of his life in strifetorn belfast and he 
dismissed the dangers of beirut when he went there to teach in 1986 
for four months he taught at the university writing home about 
the beauty of lebanon and the fine cuisine and nightlife in beirut 
on april 11 1986 he rushed out of his apartment late for an 8 
am lecture and was abducted 
his sisters said keenans mistake was to forget his irish 
passport when he left they believe his kidnappers thought he was 
american or british rather than a citizen of a small neutral 
country 
keenan was dubbed britains forgotten hostage because his 
plight did not receive the same publicity as that of anglican 
church envoy terry waite and british television journalist john 
mccarthy

civilrights leaders and school 
officials met thursday to end a boycott of classes by black 
students who want more black administrators and teachers 
the boycott at jefferson countys three schools began wednesday 
after students learned a white teacher had been hired to replace a 
vacancy left when a black teacher decided to take another job 
a committee representing the national association for the 
advancement of colored people presented school administrators with 
a list of the students demands which included the hiring of black 
administrators and black male teachers for the elementary school 
and that at least half of the school districts teachers be black 
by 1993 
superintendent bill mcrae said he supported all those demands 
the things they want are the things we want he said 
calling the meeting very congenial 
i think the attitude of the school board finally gelled into 
the realization that they had real problems before them said 
th poole sr head of the naacp in florida 
neither mcrae nor poole could say late thursday afternoon if the 
boycott would continue friday 
a total of 1055 of the 2150 students expected to enroll this 
academic year were absent thursday said alicia dery a school 
secretary about 1200 did not go to school wednesday the first 
day of the school year 
blacks comprise about 70 percent of the students at the 
elementary middle and high schools in jefferson county which is 
just east of tallahassee 
although only 36 percent of the teachers are black the 
statewide percentage of black teachers is just under 15 percent 
said betty messer mcraes assistant 
mcrae said school systems throughout florida are having a hard 
time finding qualified black teachers the pool of applicants 
includes about 10 percent to 15 percent black teachers he said 
jefferson county had planned to hire four black teachers and 
four white teachers for the new school year but earlier this month 
one of the black applicants took a job in georgia mcrae said a 
white teacher who had resigned at the end of last school year was 
hired for the spot 
the jefferson school board wednesday afternoon approved the 
hiring of a fourth black teacher to replace another teacher 
expected to take maternity leave this fall

xhosa and zulu war bands 
fought running battles thursday despite police efforts to keep them 
apart with repeated volleys of tear gas and four blacks died 
the african national congress said it could soon begin peace 
talks with the zulubased inkatha movement supporters of the two 
groups are the main combatants in tribal fighting that has killed 
more than 500 people in 12 days 
hundreds of heavily armed xhosas said they wanted to destroy a 
migrant workers hostel occupied by zulus in kagiso township west of 
johannesburg 
i dont care if i die we just want to fight with the zulus 
screamed one enraged xhosa clutching a butcher knife 
the two sides fought with spears axes and clubs as police fired 
tear gas roaming gangs of zulus with red headbands looted and 
burned deserted homes xhosas burned houses belonging to zulu 
residents 
police spokeswoman lt henriette bester said four people died 
including a woman shot by police trying to stop a crowd from 
damaging and looting houses 
zulu and xhosa leaders later held talks mediated by police but 
it seemed unlikely the meeting would end the bloodshed 
fighting between zulus tied to the conservative inkatha movement 
and xhosas mostly followers of the anc erupted aug 12 and spread 
throughout black townships around johannesburg

oil matched an alltime high and unleaded 
gasoline notched a seventhstraight record in the futures market 
thursday as traders worried about the threat of combat in the 
mideast and troubles at two texas refineries 
again its the possibility of war and the probability of 
damage to saudi oilfields if a war did occur said annlouise 
hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc 
the price of light sweet crude reached a high of 3235 per 
barrel for october delivery on the new york mercantile exchange 
before slipping back to a close of 3193 up 71 cents from 
wednesday the high equaled a record set aug 2 1983 the merc 
said 
it was the second day oil stayed above the 30perbarrel mark 
last seen in late 1985 but the market didnt have quite the 
charge that it did yesterday hittle said it was not quite 
such a rush 
traders responded to concerns over the international showdown 
coming friday the deadline set by iraq for nations to empty their 
embassies in kuwait the united states has refused to comply with 
iraqs demand 
atlantic richfield co which had frozen its wholesale price of 
gasoline two weeks ago on thursday rose prices by an average of 
25 cents a gallon arco had been able to hold prices down because 
it refines its own crude rather than buying in the volitile spot 
market 
however increased demand has forced the company to pay high 
spotmarket prices and left as many as 160 stations running out of 
gas every day said george babikian head of arcos marketing and 
refining division arco said it was risking the wrath of consumers 
by not being able to resupply stations quickly 
the futures price of gasoline also rose thursday partly because 
of problems at two texas refineries 
unleaded gasoline hit an alltime high of 111 per gallon for 
september delivery on the merc before settling at a recordhigh 
closing price of 1086 up 444 cents from wednesday unleaded 
gasoline has hit record closing prices every day since aug 15 
with prices at the pump rising in response 
shell oil co said 165000 barrels of crude cannot be refined 
daily because of a fire thursday at its plant in deer park texas 
although a spokesman was not sure how long repairs might take 
also a leak at the crown central petroleum corp refinery in the 
houston area forced a partial shutdown that analysts said would 
probably not disrupt supplies for more than a day or two 
hittle called the shortfall a pretty significant volume 
particularly given that were already facing potential declines in 
imports 
but analyst bob baker at prudentialbache securities inc said 
markets might have overreacted to the news from texas 
in other trading thursday home heating oil rose 488 cents per 
gallon to close at 9623 cents on september contracts while 
natural gas remained sluggish falling from 1555 to 1545 per 
1000 cubic feet

north and south korea inched closer to 
historic talks between their prime ministers thursday when both 
sides agreed to travel and telephone arrangements for the sept 47 
meeting 
liaison officers met at the border village of panmunjom and 
agreed north korean delegates would cross the heavily fortified 
border by car and that the two sides could use red cross phone 
lines they agreed to meet again before september 
in an interview with the newspaper chosun ilbo president roh 
taewoo said south korea would propose gradual arms reduction at 
the meeting 
he said the communist north must give up its efforts to 
overthrow the prowestern south and accept his call for free travel 
and economic exchanges between the two koreas 
roh told his administration thursday the talks could lead to 
political and military discussions that could ease four decades of 
bitter hostility on the divided korean peninsula 
the prime ministers kang younghoon of south korea and yon 
hyung muk of north korea are figureheads with little 
policymaking power but the meeting would have symbolic 
significance as the highestlevel contact ever between north and 
south 
opening the borders is seen as a step toward reunification of 
the koreas which were divided in 1945 following japans collapse 
in world war ii the two koreas remain technically at war because 
they never signed a peace treaty at the end of the korean war in 
1953 
about 200 radical students yelling antigovernment slogans 
battled riot police with rocks and firebombs thursday at seouls 
dank university riot police drove students back with tear gas 
down with rohs deceitful unification policy students 
shouted 
radicals have accused roh of insincerity in talks with north 
korea they say he is trying to divert public attention from 
pressing domestic issues and has no intention of following through 
on his promises 
the two koreas have yet to solve several issues regarding the 
prime ministers meeting including a memorandum guaranteeing 
visitors safety 
the safety issue blocked a planned border opening in midaugust 
after north korea refused to discuss safety guarantees in writing 
and asked for direct contacts with south korean dissidents 
the border has 15 million troops on each side

iowa police must release the names of 
most rape victims to the news media the state attorney generals 
office said friday but newspaper editors and broadcasters said 
they would continue to protect the names 
the opinion quickly drew the wrath of a victim services 
counselor who said it would make sexual assault victims reluctant 
to report crimes 
in response to a request by gov terry branstad assistant 
attorney general gordon allen said state law does not permit police 
to keep the names of rape victims confidential the only exception 
he said is when release of the name would jeopardize the 
investigation or put the victim in danger 
branstad will seek to change the law to assure confidentiality 
said richard vohs a spokesman for the governor 
the issue came up earlier this year when the des moines register 
challenged the practice by des moines police of routinely 
suppressing names and other information about rape victims the 
department has since released the names but none has been used in 
news stories 
although release doesnt mean the news media would use the 
names polk county victim services counselor terry shock said many 
victims wont understand that distinction 
there will almost certainly be misconceptions she said 
she said society places a negative stigma on rape victims as if 
the woman somehow brought on the crime and most victims simply do 
not want anyone to know 
face it people will be people a lot of them will blame the 
victim a lot of people arent going to report the crime or wont 
even go to the hospital for fear that the hospital has to report 
it ms shock said 
she also said that when reporters have the names theres room 
for error that would allow the name to get in print 
and somewhere or sometime theres going to be journalists who 
simply dont care she said its just very unfair to the 
victims 
allen said he was sensitive to arguments about not releasing the 
names but he said the law makes no exception for rape victims 
due to the strong presumption in favor of disclosure of 
governmental records frequently reiterated by the iowa supreme 
court it is our view that any doubts on the issue would be 
resolved in favor of disclosure allen wrote 
the law allows police to withhold information which would 
plainly and seriously jeopardize an investigation or pose a clear 
and present danger to the safety of an individual but allen said 
this exception cannot be applied to all rape cases 
to the best of my knowledge there is no other law in the 
nation that attempts to devastate victims lives like that said 
anne seymour spokeswoman for the national victim center based in 
fort worth texas and new york city im 99 percent sure 
one of the critical reasons why victims say they dont report 
the crimes is the fear of exposure she said from new york 
the national victim center serves over 7000 local victim 
service groups ms seymour said 
virtually all of iowas newspapers and radio and television 
stations have said they would not use the name of rape victims 
without permission from the victim 
mark bowden managing editor of the gazette in cedar rapids 
said the opinion will not change his papers policy of not 
publishing the names 
but bowden said mistakes leading to the broadcast or publication 
of a name could be made regardless of the law you might have an 
inexperienced reporter but is that any different than having a 
rookie at the police desk he said

an american legion post that has been 
closed since it refused to admit a black vietnam veteran last month 
has agreed to allow him to reapply the state american legion 
commander said thursday 
the veteran thurman thompson said he planned to submit another 
application 
what i would hope is that those who didnt want me they would 
reevaluate their thoughts and situations thompson said i 
hope that everything ends on a positive note 
norris kinion the state commander for the american legion said 
the fred h sexton post 1 in florence 80 miles east of columbia 
would be permitted to resume its normal activities if it accepted 
black members 
the post was suspended last week after it was disclosed that six 
members of the post had decided not to accept thompson because they 
didnt want blacks joining their group 
thompson a former navy petty officer and signalman who served 
in vietnam in 197273 works at general electric co 
at the time of the vote against thompson the post required just 
two votes to reject an applicant but the post changed its bylaws 
tuesday to allow a majority vote on all applications kinion said 
the chapters suspension has not been formally lifted he said 
but theyre being permitted to function until such time as the 
investigative committee can make its report 
the committee looking into the case will meet at the annual 
convention of the american legion starting friday in indianapolis 
kinion said 
al stein commander of the florence post did not return a phone 
call thursday afternoon 
the posts rejection of thompson prompted several members to 
resign 
maria lewis the posts secretary was fired from her job as the 
county veterans affairs officer she had opposed thompsons 
membership on the grounds that the posts bylaws prohibited 
integration 
the american legion has had black members since the organization 
was created in 1919

the us forest service said thursday it 
had authorized the university of arizona to build three telescopes 
on mount graham after determining construction wouldnt harm an 
endangered squirrel 
the justice and agriculture departments signed off on the 
project saying a study by the us fish and wildlife service had 
satisfied worries that the observatory which would include the 
worlds most powerful telescope would threaten the habitat of the 
mount graham red squirrel 
as soon as we can well sign relevant construction documents 
and obtain our permit said university spokesman steve emerine 
he said work would begin as soon as possible 
maricopa audubon society spokesman robin silver said in phoenix 
that attorneys for environmental groups opposed to the 200 million 
project would be in court by friday morning seeking a temporary 
restraining order 
expert witnesses in the hearing will now include members of 
congress the fish and wildlife service forest service biologists 
and the general acounting office silver said 
rep morris k udall dariz and other members of the arizona 
delegation oppose construction of the telescopes without further 
study udall was out of town and couldnt be reached for comment 
a survey earlier this year determined there were fewer than 150 
of the halfpound rodents one of 25 genetically distinct 
subspecies of the red squirrel scurrying over the mossy 
sprucecovered slopes of 10500foot emerald peak 
the justice department had been reviewing a recommendation by a 
team at the fish and wildlife service that another biological study 
be undertaken before construction begins on the mountain 125 miles 
northeast of tucson 
emerine said the university would work with the forest service 
and fish and wildlife service to create a buffer zone around the 
construction site so as not to disturb the squirrel 
a statement from george m leonard associate chief of the 
forest service said further consultations would be made if the 
project resulted in the deaths of more than six squirrels in any 
one year 
the university proposed the construction of the observatory in 
1984 its partners include the smithsonian institution the max 
planck observatory of west germany and the vatican observatory 
in march us district judge alfredo c marquez granted the 
request of environmental groups and issued a fourmonth injunction 
barring construction on emerald peak but an appeals court in san 
francisco overturned the delay in may 
general accounting office investigators testified before a 
congressional hearing in late june that the squirrels fate had 
become more precarious since the 1988 congressional act that 
authorized construction of the telescopes 
a springtime count indicated there were between 132 and 146 of 
the squirrels left on the mountain their only habitat

just hours aftger president mikhail s gorbachev 
issued a stern warning to iraq the soviets said friday that they 
were ending objections and backing washingtons call for using 
force to ensure a un trade embargo 
in a message to iraqi president saddam hussein gorbachev said 
the situation in the persian gulf had become extremely 
dangerous 
he said that iraqi failure to comply with un security council 
resolutions by pulling out of kuwait would inevitably prompt 
the security council to take corresponding additional measures 
the official tass news agency said 
later friday soviet un ambassador valentin v lozinskiy said 
the soviets would now back a us resolution in the security 
council authorizing the use of minimal force to halt all trade 
with iraq he also said the soviets were considering participation 
in an international naval police force that would enforce the 
tightening of economic screws on iraq 
the united states britain and france had been trying to gain 
soviet support for a security council resolution approving the use 
of force to impose the economic embargo on iraq 
the security council was expected to vote on the us resolution 
late friday or early saturday 
also friday the soviet union withdrew its embassy staff from 
kuwait before an iraqi deadline ordering embassies there to close 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 four days later the un 
security council ordered an international boycott of trade with 
iraq and called for restoration of kuwaits sovereignty the 
council also denounced the iraqi annexation of the oilrich emirate 
and demanded that baghdad allow all foreigners to leave 
soviet media did not carry the text of gorbachevs message but 
tass said he reiterated the soviet position that iraqs annexation 
of kuwait was illegal and described the situation in the persian 
gulf as extraordinary and extremely dangerous 
how the security council acts now depends fully on iraq 
tass said gorbachev in his message urged the president of iraq 
to immediately take appropriate steps 
at the united nations lozinskiy emphasized that the use of even 
minimal force should be as a last resort and said political 
and diplomatic efforts to diffuse the persian gulf crisis should 
take precedence 
he made his comments after the councils five permanent members 
the united states soviet union china france and britain 
ended more than four hours of informal meetings 
earlier in moscow foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh 
said all soviet embassy personnel had been evacuated from kuwait to 
comply with an iraqi demand to cease diplomatic activity 
the staff of the soviet embassy came back to moscow since the 
situation in kuwait made it impossible for them to continue their 
work there gremitskikh told a news conference 
from today the embassy is empty there are no personnel it is 
shut maybe locked i dont know what the procedure is 
he said that under international law the embassy remains open 
but vacant we are not in international legal terms closing the 
embassy it remains there 
the united states and more than 20 other countries said they 
would defy iraqs demand to remove all embassy personnel 
gremitskikh said the decision to evacuate does not change 
moscows position that the invasion and annexation of kuwait were 
illegal acts that should be reversed 
we believe that the decision of iraq to close all the 
international embassies in kuwait runs counter to international 
law he said the soviet union considers kuwait to be a 
participant of the world community and has diplomatic relations 
with it 
asked what circumstances made it impossible for the embassy to 
continue working he said the security of the people is first 
and foremost 
earlier in the week gremitskikh said the soviets would consider 
evacuating their diplomats if the iraqis shut off food water or 
electricity supplies to the embassy on friday he said they 
decided to evacuate before any of those things happened 
gremitskikh said the government decided so that we would not 
endanger people we would better let them come home 
all 882 soviets now have been evacuated from kuwait and returned 
to moscow gremitskikh said the evacuation of the 7791 soviet 
civilians in iraq would begin sunday starting with women children 
and invalids 
but soviet officials said this week that soviet military 
advisers would remain in iraq long an ally of moscow because of 
contractual obligations

a judge on friday refused to issue a 
temporary restraining order environmentalists had sought to prevent 
the university of arizona from starting construction on mount 
graham 
us district judge william d browning conducting a hearing by 
telephone conference call rejected the request of the sierra club 
legal defense fund the fund represents a coalition of 
environmental groups seeking to block the 200 million mount graham 
international observatory 
the environmentalists claim that the telescope project would 
encroach on the habitat of the endangered mount graham red squirrel 
browning said he had not heard anything that rises above 
speculation that construction could begin before tuesday when 
another hearing is set before us district judge alfredo c 
marquez who has agreed to cut short his vacation to be present 
on thursday the us forest service said the justice and 
agriculture departments had authorized construction of three 
telescopes after determining that a 1988 law passed by congress 
precluded further biological study over the impact an observatory 
would have on the squirrel 
by friday the university had signed a construction contract 
obtained a special use permit from the forest service and planned 
to get work crews onto the mountain as soon as possible probably 
by early next week 
work would center on transplanting small trees finishing the 
last 200 feet of a twomile access road clearing a onethird acre 
site of large trees and preparing it for pouring concrete next year 
sierra club attorney mark hughes said the restraining order was 
needed because the university would not promise to delay 
construction until the hearing tuesday 
the hearing concerns reopening a suit that marquez stayed last 
month at hughes request challenging the observatory hughes said 
marquez would be asked to enforce a provision allowing for a new 
biological study 
the forest service contends a new study is not neccessary 
jim mcnulty representing the university told browning that 
with the federal agencies green light its position is stronger 
now than ever before for beginning construction 
he said continued delays could jeopardize the project which is 
to include the columbus telescope which would be the worlds most 
powerful 
mcnulty said some work might begin before the hearing most 
likely preparing holes to transplant small trees from the onethird 
acre site for the submillimeter telescope 
however it was unlikely heavy equipment would arrive at the 
site by tuesday because crews must first be trained how to adhere 
to work restrictions in the officially designated refugium the 
squirrels prime habitat he said 
a spring census indicated that between 132 and 146 of the 
genetically distinct subspecies of red squirrels remain on the 
mountain in southeast arizona

investment club of detroit has averaged better than 12 percent a 
year for 50 years which means it has doubled its portfolio value 
on average every six years 
the difficult task in a market like this is to convince people 
there are opportunities but the opportunities are great ohara 
said 
andrew lanyi managing director of the lanyi division of 
ladenburg thalman amp co is also a fundamental investor but the 
stocks he chooses may not make the naic lists lanyi seeks small 
highly profitable undiscovered companies his better selections 
often appreciate three or four times even much more 
to find such companies requires an enormous amount of effort 
such as screening 30000 companies to uncover eight possibilities 
all will have the potential to grow into blue chips and be 
discovered by wall street 
shortly after the recent decline began several of lanyis 
selections were off sharply asked what effect the declines were 
having on him lanyi said i have become more aggressive 
lanyi said those who know company fundamentals products 
salesearnings potential management can take the upsets it 
takes discipline and patience master those he suggested and you 
can keep eyeing the opportunity 
john wright chairman of wright investors service in bridgeport 
conn manages billions of dollars of bluechip investment 
portfolios for institutions and clients and advises many other 
clients around the world 
the wright company foresaw the sharp decline and presented 
clients with extensive written analyses long before it occurred as 
he views the selloff the iraqi invasion of kuwait was merely the 
trigger 
i have thought this one would go down at least to 2700 
points on the dow jones industrial average he said then after 
a rally i thought it would decline to 2100 points 
we havent had the rally because of the invasion wright 
said while he sees a chance that the dows low will be between 
2400 and 2500 points his stronger expectation is that it will 
reach 2100 or 2200 some time in 1991 
stressing fundamental analysis wrights firm has averaged 122 
percent a year from 1961 to 1990 in anticipation of a decline he 
had reduced his equity portfolios sharply in recent months at the 
moment his portfolios are 50 percent stocks 
already wright says some longterm bargains are appearing but 
he tempers that with a rather ominous caveat that if the federal 
reserve doesnt allow interest rates to drop the country may fall 
into recession 
he doesnt think it will happen when the middle east calms 
down he believes the country will have lower interest rates and a 
much betterrun government a lot of changes must and will be made 
wright said 
the united states once again will be the world economic 
leader he said

the continuing flow of refugees from 
indochina has been joined by the yacht people cambodians with 
a little money who probably are sailing into a legal limbo 
indonesian officials describe them as a new phenomenon and 
say many of the cambodians unlike the far more numerous 
vietnamese are unlikely to be resettled anywhere except back where 
they came from 
aid workers applied the nottoaccurate label after seeing 
cambodians who were relatively well dressed come ashore from 
larger betterequipped vessels than those of the vietnamese boat 
people 
some had passports and money and wanted only fuel and supplies 
for the journey to australia 
they didnt ask for asylum said ali alatas the indonesian 
foreign minister they had money to buy food and wanted to be on 
their way were we supposed to say no please stay 
alatas was referring to australian allegations that by enabling 
cambodians to continue their journeys indonesia might be 
encouraging others to make the trip 
well over 200 cambodians have reached northwestern australia 
since november by sailing more than 2500 miles through the vast 
indonesian archipelago prime minister bob hawke says the 
cambodians in general left their homeland for economic rather 
than political reasons and do not qualify as refugees 
australia has made clear it does not want to become a first 
asylum country the first in which boat people arrive 
until now that role has been played by hong kong and member 
nations of the association of southeast asian nations indonesia 
malaysia thailand the philippines singapore and brunei 
australia wants to continue choosing people for resettlement from 
those screened as refugees in the existing camps 
most australians seem to feel they should be compassionate 
toward genuine refugees but there has been a backlash recently 
against asian migrants 
more than 1750 cambodians have landed in indonesia most of 
them since february and are held with other refugees on galang 
island just south of singapore the majority are young men who 
tell reporters they fled to avoid being drafted to fight phnom 
penhs war with rebels 
an exodus of cambodians by boat began after vietnam withdrew 
most of its occupation force in september 1989 that left the 
government in phnom penh which vietnam installed after invading 
the country more than 11 years ago responsible for fighting the 
resistance 
another 300000 cambodians who were uprooted by the vietnamese 
invasion languish in camps just across the border with thailand 
this is a bad time for boat people beyond the normal perils of 
pirates and storms attitudes are hardening and they face 
increasing prospects of being pushed out to sea or sent back to the 
land they risked their lives escaping 
malaysia has turned away 8700 indochinese boat people since may 
1989 according to diplomatic sources in kuala lumpur many of 
those moved on to galang island which the un high commissioner 
for refugees built for 5000 people and now holds more than 17000 
indonesia regards the cambodians as displaced persons neither 
refugees nor asylum seekers pending a decision on their status 
they are being sheltered on humanitarian grounds said lt col 
doekseno who is in charge of galang 
as a new refugee group they are not covered by the 
comprehensive plan of action drawn up in geneva under un auspices 
in june 1989 
the plans purpose was to screen and divide vietnamese boat 
people into economic migrants and political refugees those with 
justifiable fear of political persecution are entitled to 
resettlement and economic migrants are returned home 
alatas said cambodian boat people should be added to the un 
plan other asian diplomats are less certain fearing many of the 
300000 refugees along the thaicambodian border might try to set 
sail in hope of a new life 
whether cambodians are included may not matter since the un 
plan appears in danger of collapse at the annual asean meeting in 
july the six members accused the united states and vietnam of 
making the refugee problem worse by refusing to approve the return 
of economic migrants 
about 80 percent of the estimated 130000 people currently in 
camps in the region are nonpolitical refugees asean officials 
said 
since washington and hanoi agreed to the un plan originally 
but later did not comply with the provision on economic migrants 
asean members have reserved the right to turn boat people away

feeling a little alienated 
ever find yourself late at night wondering just what has gone 
wrong with the republic is the social contract up for renewal in 
your neighborhood 
and if andrew dice clay did not exist would it be necessary to 
invent him 
for the answer to the last question and more tune in tonight to 
pbs and edge a funny adult and extremely wellwritten look at 
american pop culture it will show you things you otherwise 
probably would never see 
vanity fair writer james wolcott tries to understand why people 
laugh at the abusive humor of the 90s in the persona of andrew 
dice clay 
significantly the segment is titled another day in hell 
this is definitely for adults only not only does edge 
liberally excerpt clays raunchy unexpurgated concert routine but 
it discusses his appeal in terms of class hatred and 
marginalized white workingclass males 
whats impressive about clay is the emancipatory and 
truthtelling impulse in him says frederic smoler a professor 
of intellectual history at sarah lawrence college 
the grimmest and saddest and thing about clay is when he 
strips away a thing debunks it whats left to his audiences view 
and his own is pretty small and ugly 
the least accessible segment is about the faceless photographs 
of new york city conceptual artist lorna simpson its followed by 
a nice ballad inexplicably sung on a bare city rooftop by 
singersongwriter john hiatt 
the great humorist buck henry comes on next with a visit to the 
nixon library in yorba linda calif in opening his essay on the 
fall and rise of the elder statesman henry notes that yorba linda 
means beautiful yorba 
there is commentary by professor stanley cutler author of the 
wars of watergate who notes that the nixon library makes no 
mention of nixons accepting a pardon for any watergate crimes he 
may have committed 
someday hell be left alone to history cutler notes he is 
smiling 
henry notes tom brokaws visit to yorba linda to anchor the 
evening news from the museum and the nixon birthplace a kitbuilt 
house that cost 800 from the factory and 400000 to restore 
theres such a nice suppressed note of hysteria and loathing to 
the piece far too soon henry bids a fond farewell to the nixon 
complex he waves goodbye and drives away renewed refreshed 
the host of the series emmy award winner robert krulwich 
reviews the recent history of student works at the art institute of 
chicago 
remember when one student painted mayor harold washington in 
brassiere underpants garter belt and stockings the painting got 
arrested 
one year later student dread scott tylers wretched how 
to display the flag ignited the furor of veterans and flagwavers 
by displaying a flag on the floor that tacitly invited spectators 
to walk on it 
the beleaguered head of the institute school tony jones notes 
that people who tired of abstract art and called for the return to 
figurative art have gotten their wish with a vengeance 
then the show shows us four performance artists whose 
applications for federal grants were rejected its a delightful 
irony 
and with a wonderfully wry finale the excellent comedian 
actor writer and simpsons voice harry shearer explains to us 
just why anchormen are girdling the globe to cover the story 
shearer is magnificently lowkey 
make time to see this pilot episode a joint production of new 
york citys wnet and britains bbc2 if successful the pilot 
will be followed by 10 onehour programs says wnet 
do yourself a favor and tune in

the steep decline in stock prices this summer 
has left investors staring into the jaws of what some say may be 
wall streets first sustained bear market in nearly a decade 
todays generation of stock traders and analysts is by no means 
unaccustomed to to the phenomenon of falling markets most of them 
were around for the crash of 1987 which provided all the 
conditions you could want for a baptism of fire 
that debacle produced a 36 percent drop in the dow jones 
industrial average enough to rank prominently on any list of 
modernday market declines 
but almost all the carnage occurred in a span of less than two 
months and stocks began to recover quickly thereafter en route to 
new highs 
many an investor it appeared was still numb from the shock 
when the wounds began to heal 
for an undisputed example of the kind of long debilitating 
slide for which classic bear markets are famous one has to go back 
to 198182 before the big boom of the 80s on wall street was 
ready to start 
from april 27 1981 to aug 12 1982 the dow jones industrials 
tumbled from 102405 to 77692 as the economy struggled through a 
recession exacerbated by rapid inflation and high interest rates 
instead of the sudden jolt of a crash the market in those days 
experienced a kind of slow steady erosion that gave investors 
plenty of time to think about how much money they were losing and 
how bleak the outlook seemed 
the question of the moment now of course is whether stocks are 
in for a similar malaise or just undergoing one of the periodic 
corrections that have punctuated the long bull market since 82 
simple to ask not so easy to answer incipient bear markets are 
notoriously cunning at disguising themselves as shortterm 
corrections and vice versa 
on the optimistic side however analysts point out that 
authentic bear markets have seldom begun with a single event that 
serves as an explanation for the decline in this case iraqs 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
indeed many veteran marketwatchers worry more when declines 
set in that have no readily discernible cause 
past major confrontations such as the cuban missile crisis or 
other military squabbles that were resolved favorably proved to be 
just a blip in the stock markets general trend observes greg 
smith an analyst at prudentialbache securities 
we could be in one of those blips or this could be something 
much more significant 
norman fosback editor of a group of investment advisory letters 
published by the institute for econometric research in fort 
lauderdale fla plants himself squarely on the blip side of 
the argument 
price weakness touched off by the geopolitical crisis does not 
constitute a bear market he declared in the firms mutual fund 
forecaster it does appear to be the 10 percent to 15 percent 
correction that has been long overdue 
midstream bull market corrections are nearly always abrupt 
they shake out the markets weak participants by leading them to 
believe falsely that a bear market has begun 
one big risk behind this view is the chance that the market has 
looked beyond the persian gulf showdown and correctly discerned the 
approach of a recession 
it will take a good while for these overlays of uncertainty to 
sort themselves out observed morton silverman portfolio 
strategist at piper jaffray amp hopwood in minneapolis 
silverman concluded its a time for prudence not 
opportunism

from coast to coast the federal government is 
out of jail cells 
space is so short that the 52 deputy us marshals in west texas 
last year drove nearly 1 million miles moving prisoners sometimes 
driving all night from remote jails 
it is so short that 2530 women awaiting trial for federal 
crimes in new york city are held 550 miles away in alderson wva 
and public defenders in seattle daily drive 30 to 90 miles to 
see clients sometimes taking all day to visit a jail on a puget 
sound island 
theres a national jail crisis said howard safir 
operations chief of the us marshals service for the past 12 
years theres just no room at the inn 
every day armed deputy marshals ferry their hazardous cargo 
through americas towns and countrysides the routes change often 
to prevent escapes and because yesterdays vacant jail is now full 
those involved say all this driving risks lives wastes money 
and conflicts with the defendants right to a fair trial 
if someone attacks one of the marshals caged vans to break out 
a prisoner weve got a shotgun said chief deputy bob 
christman of seattle so if it goes down theres going to be 
somebody dead 
moving prisoners between jails and courts costs the marshals 
service 275 million a year assistant director joseph enders said 
a major portion of that could be saved as much as 70 percent in 
some districts if there were enough cells close to courthouses 
using farflung jails causes serious problems in communicating 
with our clients tremendous expense and inefficiency said 
richard richman a federal public defender in boston 
some federal officials say this crunch could have been avoided 
they see it as the predictable outcome of a decade of law and order 
legislation and spending that added more than 4500 lawmen and 
prosecutors but gave short shrift to jails a less glamorous but 
crucial component of criminal justice 
as a result 
marshals in boston hold most of their prisoners in connecticut 
and want to rent a condominium in danbury to save hotel expenses 
for deputies defendants in rhode island new jersey new mexico 
and oregon also are held in other states 
prisoners awaiting trial in kansas washington and west texas 
are scattered in as many as 10 jails in each state marshals in 
miami use 11 south florida jails 
in oregon marshals spend more than half their time hauling 
prisoners marshals everywhere complain that the driving drains 
manpower from their other duties hunting federal fugitives 
serving court orders guarding courthouses and protecting 
threatened witnesses and judges 
at the federal level jails hold people awaiting trial convicts 
go to prison for years the federal government did not have its own 
jails because most federal defendants got out on bail before trial 
now it has 14 jails and only four chicago new york los 
angeles and san diego fit the ideal a downtown site connected to 
or near a federal courthouse the rest are detention wings carved 
out of prisons nearly all in rural areas 
most federal cells still are leased in state county or city 
jails 
when president ronald reagan took office 1981 he was determined 
to use federal power to curb street violence with new agents and 
new laws there were 477 vacant beds in federal jails then 
in 10 years republican administrations added 1770 prosecutors 
1015 drug agents and 1740 fbi agents but fewer than one jail bed 
for each new prosecutor 
the agents arrested far more defendants than that and the new 
laws assured that many more people would be jailed before trial 
and the inmates became more dangerous because the 1984 bail 
reform act and the 1988 drug control law required preventive 
detention for those charged with violent or drug crimes 
during the decade the average daily number of federal jail 
inmates exploded from 3618 to 13916 but the federal government 
itself only added 1669 jail beds 
and on top of that 607 local jails threw their federal boarders 
out 
the local jails had grown even more overcrowded than federal 
jails as states mimicked the federal gettough policies they got 
so packed that state and federal judges limited the crowding 
now more than one in four large urban jails is under court order 
to reduce its population 
and the bureau of prisons has 5984 inmates in federal jails 
built for 3272 
so the marshals reach farther into the countryside to find 
vacant cells 
the farther you take a prisoner the more potential there is 
for an escape or a traffic accident safir said in an interview 
before his recent retirement he thinks the marshals are fortunate 
that no one has escaped in transit during the last four years and 
accidents have been fenderbenders 
every time you move a guy in custody its a security risk to 
deputies to communities we drive through to all the drivers on 
the freeways said christman in seattle

the ordinary person even the ordinary 
politician has a difficult time distinguishing a prison from a 
jail 
its a difference howard safir had to explain over and over for 
the last 12 years as operations director of the us marshals 
service safir was responsible for finding jail cells not prison 
cells for federal inmates 
safir who recently retired got them from the us bureau of 
prisons or leased them from other governments 
the us justice department uses jails differently from the 
states counties and cities 
federal jail cells house only individuals who have been denied 
bail while they await trial or for those convicted but awaiting 
sentencing 
state and local jails do that too but they also hold 
individuals serving short misdemeanor sentences the federal 
government sends such convicts to lowsecurity prisons and prison 
camps 
many states now also keep some more serious offenders in jails 
because their prisons are overcrowded 
marshals lawyers and judges agree that the most efficient jails 
are connected by secure tunnel or bridge to the courthouse where 
the inmates are tried 
a prison in a cornfield works fine a jail doesnt safir 
said because jail inmates have to go to court each day they 
need access to their lawyers they are almost all still notguilty 
prisoners under our system they have more rights than convicts

wolfgang jung had spent his first two years 
in college absorbing communist economics when abruptly the world 
changed so did his homework 
jung is spending his last two years of college cramming for 
capitalism at east berlins college of economics where even the 
teachers are taking a crash course in freemarket thinking 
the college is part of a vast educational system that is both 
trying to reshape itself quickly and continuing to train young 
people for jobs that may not exist on graduation day 
nearly 21 million east germans from elementary to graduate 
level are beginning a new school year that will be much different 
from the previous 42 
millions of new textbooks free of communist ideology have 
flooded in from west germany bloated departments devoted to 
marxistleninist theory have been dissolved 
hundreds of russianlanguage teachers spent the summer learning 
to teach english more than onethird of the nations 1 million 
teachers are enrolled in retraining programs 
on the secluded campus where the communist secret police once 
learned their fearsome skills music science and languages are 
taught to an ordinary student body 
still experts say the changes are almost superficial 
most of the old teachers former guardians of ideology and 
components of a vast domestic intelligence network will be back in 
their classrooms 
all principals rectors and chancellors were fired but the 
communities entrusted with refilling those jobs returned more than 
half to their former positions 
what has happened to east germanys schools in the year since 
communism fell is only the beginning of a process that may need a 
generation to complete the experts say 
for jung and others in the class of 92 that is too long 
i didnt know what a corporation was when we began learning a 
market economy said jung 24 sitting in the school cafeteria 
bent over a west german textbook 
it was socialism socialism socialism now we have to go back 
to the beginning 
the democratic government elected in march has only begun 
decentralizing the system reteaching the teachers and eliminating 
the rigidity of lesson plans said hansjoachim meyer the 
education minister 
meyer believes the five state governments that will be created 
oct 14 to fit in with the west german system will have a more 
formidable task when they assume full responsibility for the 
schools 
he said the hardest job will be to change the way people think 
to instill individuality and imagination in a system dulled by 
decades of restrictive paranoid stalinism 
we need probably four to five years to introduce the necessary 
structures he said but in order to develop new attitudes 
toward life toward society yes that will take a generation 
meshing the east german education system with west germanys is 
another problem east german students for example need 12 years 
of schooling to qualify for a university while west germans must 
have 13 
it is a major problem to get east germany to fit into the 
whole context said monika renz a researcher for the standing 
conference of education ministers of the 11 west german states 
the group is debating how to merge the systems and not all 
the states are convinced east german schools are up to par she 
said 
all have agreed some grudgingly to allow east germans equal 
access to west german universities with admission quotas based on 
percentages of east german applicants 
east german educators bristle at criticism of their schools and 
what they feel is condescension by west germans 
they give us their textbooks their lectures their 
seminars said heidi klemm who teaches english they say 
its all rubbish your schools 
she pointed out that the exodus to west germany last year which 
helped bring down the communist government in east germany was 
largely of people judged to be highly skilled 
ms klemm spoke while strolling across her college campus 
outside the small farm community of golm 25 miles south of berlin 
and just outside potsdam 
ivy covers many buildings and barbed wire rings the periphery 
the college was the officers training school of the former stasi 
secret police where only the brightest in the feared organization 
could gain admittance 
stasi students and faculty were expelled late last year and the 
school was converted into an extension of a teachers college in 
potsdam 
the potsdam school occupies beautiful colonnaded buildings in a 
complex of 19th century palaces and gardens built for frederick the 
great the prussian king in them nearly 3000 students study 
languages medicine art and geography 
it is the largest teachers college in east germany and has a 
severe case of nerves 
all administrators of all schools were dismissed in june 
committees of local officials students parents and teachers have 
been meeting to recommend who should be retained 
the potsdam schools committee began work sept 1 
if you come here in january maybe someone else will be 
sitting here knut kiesant the vice chancellor said in his 
spacious office 
kiesant has been with the school for six years and wolfgang 
strauss director of international relations for 25 both say 
people who rose to high levels in the old regime are being 
persecuted 
whether i am good or i am bad is not a question of black or 
white as a child would decide strauss said 
both men said they favor the new politics in east germany 
most school committees have completed their work and more than 
half perhaps 65 percent rehired their old administrators said 
meyer the education minister 
he attributed that to a lack of qualified alternative 
candidates apathy in local committees and deference to the old 
headmasters 
meyer predicted more administrators would be replaced when the 
new state governments took over but recommended against wholesale 
dismissals of teachers 
teachers are such a large group he said that they deserve a 
chance to change with the changing society 
many may be weeded out by economic collapse unpaid bills are 
mounting at the potsdam school and it has a 51 ratio of students 
to teachers compared with 301 in west germany strauss said 
economic problems are increasing across the country presaging 
hard times for students nearing graduation 
agriculture students have learned techniques applicable only to 
the dying collective farms thousands of trade school students are 
apprenticed to factories expected to close 
no school has had to shift gears more quickly than the 
4500student college of economics 
about 60 of the 200 professors have been replaced with western 
experts said hanspeter krueger the new vice chancellor 
krueger said the school added crash programs so students and 
teachers could catch up with capitalism 
we not only have to learn how to teach a market economy we 
have to teach how to live in a market economy he said

a year ago marshal bill jonas of san antonio heard of a plot to 
attack a marshals van and free two prisoners so he flew them 180 
miles nine months earlier he changed routes to elude someone 
who tried to set up a roadblock on the 108mile route from san 
antonio to bastrop 
another risk is boredom 
we had a fellow resign the other day said kernan bagley 
marshal in portland ore he told me im not going to spend my 
life transporting prisoners bagley said that task consumes 55 
to 60 percent of his deputies time twice what it would if jails 
were nearby 
it burns my people out said seattles christman to bring 
prisoners from tacoma my people have to get up at 415 am 
drive two rush hours and work a full day they get home at 8 pm 
its not good for the prisoners either its not good for the 
attorneys who cant get to their clients as easily as they should 
these people are still innocent and have a right to see 
attorneys christman said 
if were lucky said richman the boston public defender 
the closest we get our clients is an hours drive away 
judges regularly postpone trials and order marshals to drive 
prisoners hundreds of miles to get an hour a week with their 
attorney richman said 
the eight federal public defenders in seattle each handling up 
to 30 cases spend up to onefifth of their time driving to see 
clients according to public defender tom hillier 
private defense lawyers like barry wilson in boston have to 
charge their clients for time spent driving to see them why 
should a person have to pay more money to his lawyer because he 
cant make bail wilson asked 
all this was predictable when you added those agents and 
laws safir said weve been waving this red flag for five 
years 
stan morris marshals service director until last fall said he 
could not get attorneys general edwin meese and dick thornburgh to 
pay attention to jails not even by sending thornburgh a weekly 
memo on a problem in his hometown pittsburgh 
bureau of prisons director j michael quinlan granted that 
growth has been a little greater than we anticipated but said 
i dont believe we should have asked for more money for jails 
its important not to overbuild quinlan said 
at justice associate deputy attorney general margaret love 
conceded the shortage became acute in 1986 she said thornburgh 
set up a jails task force in march of this year 
safir said justice finally is beginning to focus on the 
problem and cited three promising moves 
using new legislation marshals for the first time have hired 
a private company to build and operate a federal jail in kansas 
and plan another in new england 
the bureau of prisons plans to build 4772 jail cells by 
mid1993 if president bushs budget is approved another 1250 
would be added but the marshals expect to have 16000 additional 
daily inmates by 1995 
this spring justice got congress to switch 20 million from 
prison construction to a program that pays local governments to 
build jails in return for 15year federal leases on some beds the 
program will have 35 million this year safir said local 
governments already have applied for 129 million 
the marshals think even more will be needed 
marshal bagley in oregon asked that jail space be added to 
federal buildings under construction but was turned down marshal 
jonas in west texas thinks downtown federal jails will be needed in 
21 big cities only 10 are planned 
some defense lawyers members of congress and prison officials 
think the government cannot build its way out of the problem they 
think far more defendants are jailed than ever committed crimes or 
fled while on bail 
but they are not expecting a quick change as public defender 
hillier said im an advocate of changing some of these mindless 
laws and throwing fewer people in jail but thats probably not 
realistic in this dark age

saddam husseins troops marched into kuwait on aug 2 and 
suddenly summer stalled overnight america entered a conflict 
defined by diplomats and kings economics and complicated moral 
stands 
it is an unhappy new world and americans are still trying to 
sort it out many are able to reduce the persian gulf crisis to 
red white and blue but others are wrestling with shades of gray 
some people react with anger some people react with a feeling 
of needing to share love the feelings are massive and different 
said betty walters whose son and grandson are with the army in

even while urging americans to conserve energy 
the vacationing president bush has been guzzling fuel by land by 
sea and by air 
his most conspicuous fuel consumption has come at the helm of 
his twinengine cigarette speedboat fidelity but the boat is just 
one of the entries on his vacation fuel bill 
he burns thousands of gallons of fuel while jetting back and 
forth between washington and his vacation home in kennebunkport 
maine 
more fuel is burned by marine one the sikorsky h3 helicopter 
that takes bush from air force one at pease air force base in new 
hampshire to the helipad in his yard in maine 
another visible energy drain are the golf carts he and his 
partners use on the presidents highspeed runs around the golf 
course 
public images of bush in motion are a sharp contrast from the 
1970s television shots of president carter who donned a sweater as 
the government urged less energy consumption during a previous 
energy crisis 
asked about the differing images white house spokesman steve 
hart said itd be kind of inappropriate to go on tv in front of 
a fire now 
jets helicopters and limousines are part of the presidency 
hart maintained 
i think most americans would support his need to do that in 
order to do his job he said 
soon bush will burn even more jet fuel when he takes to the 
skies in a new jumbo air force one with a bigger gas tank 
according to spokesmen at andrews air force base in maryland where 
the planes are kept 
the boeing 707s that now serve as air force one are to be 
replaced by a new boeing 747 which was delivered to the air force 
thursday 
andrews spokesman sgt jim guthrie estimated the old air force 
one burns 15000 pounds per hour and the new one 22000 pounds an 
hour another base official master sgt rick fuller said seven 
pounds of jet fuel equals 1 gallon 
this means bushs old plane burned 1350 worth of fuel an hour 
about the flying time to kennebunkport from the white house 
based on the average price of about 63 cents a gallon prior to the 
mideast crisis based on the more recent price of 108 a gallon 
the bill would be 231429 an hour the new plane will burn 
339427 worth of fuel an hour at current prices 466 percent 
more 
guthrie said the older presidential jets can hold 23800 gallons 
in their tanks while the new 747 will have a capacity of 53862 
gallons neither official knew how much fuel air force one uses in 
a year 
that would vary from year to year that would vary from 
president to president fuller said 
former president reagans trips to his ranch in california for 
example used up more fuel per trip than bushs flights to 
kennebunkport but bush has been a more frequent flier 
president reagan didnt fly quite as much as president bush 
so it might average out in the long run fuller said 
bush publicly defended his boat excursions in response to 
reporters questions wednesday 
im going to keep using my boat and i hope the rest of 
america will prudently recreate bush said at a kennebunkport 
news conference 
spokesman hart was unsure how much fuel is used by the 
presidents speedboat workers at southern maine marina where the 
boat is docked declined comment 
a man at a nearby kennebunkport marina said the twinscrew 
fidelity is not among the worst gas guzzlers on the high seas but 
neither is it particularly fuelefficient 
he uses big carburetors on it said john daley of chicks 
marina inc where gasoline cost 160 a gallon thursday

banking lawyers are dusting off the statute 
books to examine a 50yearold law slashing the interest rate some 
activeduty servicemen pay on a wide range of loans to 6 percent 
bankers said thursday they have no idea how many people pressed 
into service by the persian gulf crisis might seek breaks on their 
student loans credit cards and home mortgages under a section of 
the soldiers and sailors civil relief act of 1940 
the potential beneficiaries include the roughly 50000 
reservists being called up the law has always covered military 
personnel but is rarely invoked because few volunteers and career 
servicepeople enter the military already in debt 
you dont join the army to get a 6 percent mortgage said 
saul kramer a partner with the new york law firm proskauer rose 
goetz amp mendelsohn 
the american bankers association which represents the nations 
commercial banks said its members have a long history of 
compliance through world war ii the korean war and vietnam and 
will continue to comply said spokesman mark burneko 
a gi would make a request for interest reduction to his or her 
bank which would require verification of active military service 
the government is not required to reimburse the banks for the rate 
reduction 
the law only covers debts incurred before the serviceperson or 
reservist begins active military duty it was designed to protect 
them from going unduly into debt as a result of service kramer 
said 
donner day a spokesman for the department of veterans affairs 
in washington said many people with large incomes who are called 
to active duty all of a sudden have their salaries transformed to 
500 a month theyre unprepared to satisfy their financial 
obligations 
most servicemen are unfamiliar with the law day said citibank 
the nations biggest bank and largest consumer lender has received 
a just few dozen calls from customers who may qualify 
many bankers say it will probably be a month before they have an 
idea of the demand for interest forgiveness 
the basic savings account was paying about 2 percent interest 
when the act was instituted and congress has not adjusted the 6 
percent cap since the law took effect kramer noted 
obviously the government has great power during times of 
distress like were in now he said 
mortgage rates currently are running slightly above 10 percent 
personal loan rates can approach double that but experts say that 
banks liability under the law spread out among institutions 
nationwide would be negligible 
its peanuts said stephen berman an analyst at county 
securities usa when asked what the law could cost banks the 
nations financial institutions have been under pressure for some 
time because of bad third world debt a shaky real estate market 
and a slowing economy 
among individual banks citibank and manufacturers hanover trust 
co were among the first to acknowledge they will honor requests 
from servicepeople who qualify 
both institutions have begun setting up verification procedures 
spokespeople said 
unless someone lists themselves as a private or a sergeant on 
a loan application or lists their employer as the military the 
bank would not know said citibank spokesman william ahearn with 
reservists its almost impossible for the bank to know he added 
not everyone being called to duty is likely to qualify for the 
break and the dollar figures involved are not necessarily large 
the average outstanding home mortgage balance is roughly 
55000 according to the mortgage bankers association of america 
many homeowners are carrying loans at lower than current rates 
and recent bank industry statistics show the average credit card 
holder has amassed a debt of just 2042 on his or her credit cards 
one banker who asked not to be identified said any lost 
revenue resulting from the law would amount to a hiccup

the middle east crisis has caused a dip in 
stocks of big construction companies that work in that part of the 
world but some analysts believe theyre still a good investment 
fluor corp an irvinebased construction and engineering firm 
has seen its stock tumble more than 25 percent since the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait closing wednesday at a near 52week low of 
32 on thursday it closed down further at 31 in trading on the 
new york stock exchange 
many investors are nervous about fluor the company once had 
most of its business in the middle east and just recently won a 
contract in saudi arabia potentially worth billions of dollars 
but securities analyst john n simon and fellow analysts suggest 
fluor and other major construction and engineering firms are in 
better shape than many people believe and may even benefit from the 
crisis 
analysts pin the stock price drop on a misunderstanding of 
fluors middle east role and general wall street jitters 
is fluor underpriced whats underpriced when everybodys 
panicking asked simon with seidler amdec securities inc in los 
angeles i certainly havent told anyone to sell their fluor 
stock which has gotten some people mad to me thats a market 
reaction not a reaction to the current circumstances 
fluor like bechtel corp in san francisco and parsons corp in 
pasadena stands to gain if oil prices stay high and the world 
starts looking for oil in places other than the middle east some 
analysts said 
the analysts anticipate the demand for oil will increase with 
big construction and engineering firms expected to play a large 
role in oil projects in undertapped regions like canada and 
vietnam 
a number of both real and emotional factors are moving 
stock said rick maslin a fluor spokesman but the price of 
oil is going up and its probably going to mean opportunities will 
exist in other parts of the world 
construction and engineering companies with middle east ties 
have put themselves over the last decade in a better position to 
weather gulf crises fluor and parsons both heavily involved in 
the middle east in the 1970s are now considerably more 
diversified analysts said 
even current middle east projects do not appear to be threatened 
both fluor and parsons this summer won contracts from saudi 
aramco to build and refurbish oil and gas facilities in saudi 
arabia the contracts could each be worth more than 4 billion over 
the next nine years 
so far that schedule and work contract have not been impacted 
at all said debra williams a spokeswoman for parsons a closely 
held firm 
ms williams did not want to speculate at any length on whether 
the firm would benefit down the road by the middle east crisis but 
she added at least at this point it hasnt impacted the growth 
of projects that were involved in 
however the middle east crisis has hurt engineering and 
construction firms in other ways from fluors stock decline to 
concerns about the safety of middle east employees 
parsons has been unable to locate about 100 employees on public 
works projects in kuwait since the aug 2 invasion among the 
missing are 12 us citizens and their eight dependents 
from a business standpoint were ok said williams our 
primary concern is for the people theres basically 
aroundtheclock attempts at direct communication and 
aroundtheclock communication with the state department 
fluor evacuated dependents of workers on saudi arabia projects 
and moved employees near the saudi arabiairaq border to safer 
locations about 100 employees remain in saudi arabia said maslin 
bechtel earlier this month evacuated from saudi arabia an 
unspecified number of what it called nonessential workers 
along with employees dependents

despite the skyrocketing price of gasoline and 
rampant accusations of pricegouging petroleum experts say 
consumers arent feeling the pain nearly as badly as they did 
during the oil shocks of the 1970s 
some contend oil prices would have to reach 60 a barrel and 
gasoline would have to hit 2 a gallon at the pump to make the 
situation analogous to the rapid rise in fuel costs americans 
absorbed back then 
three weeks after iraqs invasion of kuwait sent world petroleum 
markets into a frenzy no one seems ready to predict with certainty 
that prices will rise to those levels 
but industry and government experts said wednesday they werent 
ruling anything out with oil prices surging over the 31 barrel 
mark for the first time in nearly five years 
they said all bets would be off if the middle east standoff 
develops into combat that destroys oil facilities in saudi arabia 
which has the worlds largest known crude oil supply 
if we lost kuwaiti iraqi and saudi arabian oil there would 
be a real deficit said bill hermann chief economist for the 
chevron corp youd have to cripple most of the saudi exporting 
facilities before that would happen that would imply a shooting 
war and we would take out iraqi facilities as well 
a clash of that magnitude could remove almost a fifth of world 
production from the markets hermann said 
although gasoline prices have jumped about 16 cents to the 
124agallon level since the middle east crisis began oil 
economists said the increase is mild compared with the 1970s price 
spirals after inflation is accounted for 
some experts say the inflationadjusted cost of driving is about 
as low as it was more than 40 years ago 
its the cheapest to propel a car for one mile its less than 
5 cents hermann said he cited chevron figures which when 
adjusted for inflation show that it cost 105 cents to drive a 
mile in 1980 and 8 cents in 1960 
the energy information administration an independent 
statistical agency of the energy department uses figures that 
indicate 1988 was the cheapest year ever for gasoline 
oil prices peaked in 1981 following the iranian revolution 
unleaded gasoline hit 142 per gallon at its height federal 
statisticians say the pump price would have to climb to 198 to 
reach the same real price today 
i dont know of anyone whos predicting prices like that 
said an official with the energy information administration who 
spoke on condition of anonymity his agency is refraining from 
making predictions about prices at this point 
theres just too much uncertainty spokesman jonathan cogan 
said at some point we will have to go out on a limb and make 
some forecasts 
hermann believes that real pump prices of gasoline wont move 
back up to the early 1980s levels unless a fullscale war breaks 
out and the price of crude oil shoots up to around 40 per barrel 
the government statisticians estimated it would take a crude price 
of above 60 a barrel 
three weeks after the kuwait invasion crude prices were hitting 
levels only half that size on the new york mercantile exchange 
the american automobile association said this week that its 
nationwide check of unleaded selfserve regular averaged 1237 a 
gallon on monday up 21 cents from a week earlier at the time of 
the latest aaa survey the pump price had gone up 162 cents since 
the latest oil crisis began 
but other observers say consumers are paying far more for their 
energy as their tax money is used to pick up the tab for the 
deployment of the largest us military force since the vietnam war 
the president of the national defense council foundation a 
washingtonarea think tank said that if one includes the extra 
cost of the military buildup in the persian gulf americans are 
probably paying more than 70 a barrel for oil 
if hostilities break out youre talking about 100 a 
barrel milton copulos said 
a ralph nader consumers group buyers up agreed that energy has 
its hidden costs 
a lot of costs we pay for our oil is not factored into the 
price research director christopher dyson said environmental 
costs are another factor in the price of energy that is not felt 
every time a consumer fills up the family car dyson said 
despite the statistics that show pump prices are lower when 
adjusted for inflation the nader group accuses oil companies of 
gouging the public by being too quick to pass on price increases 
and too slow to pass on price decreases 
we think they are gouging dyson said we think the price 
increases have been unjustified 
oil companies have in recent weeks mounted a public relations 
offensive to proclaim their contention that the industry as a whole 
is not taking an unfair advantage of the situations any improper 
pricing has been done on a small scale by retailers the oil giants 
have said adding that consumers can always drive their cars down 
the street to cheaper competitors if that happens

once upon a time when the world convulsed with 
political turmoil or war global investors would funnel money into 
dollars as a safe haven strategy to preserve their wealth 
no more 
judging by the reaction of investors to the mideast upheaval 
the dollar has been shunned for german marks british pounds and 
japanese yen showing the us currency has lost its preeminent 
status as an investment refuge some economists say 
in the past the mere threat of war was enough to unleash a 
torrent of investments in the dollar and dollardenominated 
securities such as us stocks and bonds the enormous demand for 
dollars from abroad typically sent the value of the currency 
soaring relative to yen mark pound and other foreign money 
but since the dollars brief jump following iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait its value against most other major currencies 
has slumped reaching an alltime low against the mark and a 
nineyear low against the pound 
what went wrong 
some experts say the change is the inevitable outcome of the end 
of the cold war 
previously investors feared any conflict could escalate into a 
superpower confrontation with european security at risk said 
david wyss chief financial economist at drimcgrawhill inc a 
lexington mass research firm 
but with ussoviet relations vastly improved the prospect of 
a global war has all but disappeared and investors feel secure 
leaving their money in europe or sending it there instead of the 
united states he said 
there isnt the old specter of a european conflagration that 
would wipe out all their capital said john mccarthy chief 
currency dealer for amsterdam rotterdam bank in new york in the 
past youd see people liquidating marks liquidating swiss francs 
to physically get their capital out of the battlefield 
another reason the dollar hasnt benefited is that currency can 
be moved around the world more quickly than a decade ago experts 
say 
electronic funds transfer can be accomplished almost 
instantaneously legal hurdles to shifting funds also have receded 
people dont feel they have to make these assetallocation 
decisions as quickly as they had in the past mccarthy said 
however should the persian gulf standoff escalate into a 
shooting war the dollar could still benefit mccarthy said 
other experts say the value of the dollar is depressed for 
reasons that overshadow its security as an investment 
chief among them are worries that the nation is about to enter a 
recession which could erode the value of the currency said 
lincoln anderson an economist at the investment house bear 
stearns amp co anderson said he isnt convinced the dollar has lost 
its safehaven status 
another factor is the rise in interest rates abroad 
particularly in germany and britain compared with us rates as 
interest rates climb elsewhere dollardenominated investments such 
as us treasury bonds look less attractive since they dont earn 
as high a rate 
wyss said the main beneficiaries of the interest rate 
differential appear to be the mark and the pound while the yen has 
gained to a lesser extent 
the dollar bought 15885 marks and 14718 yen at the close of 
trading on aug 1 the day before iraqs invasion by midweek the 
dollar had fallen to about 15480 marks an alltime low and 
about 14600 yen 
the pound cost 18555 on aug 1 by midweek it took about 
19275 to buy one pound the highest value for the pound since 
december 1981 
german interest rates are at least as high as ours germany 
looks at least as safe their inflation rate is lower and you no 
longer have that military threat from eastern europe to worry 
about wyss said 
the pound and british government bonds have attracted investors 
because britain supplies all its oil needs domestically from the 
north sea easing inflationary fears associated with the rise in 
oil prices he said 
investments in both german and british government bonds are 
giving a greater return that us treasury bonds after each 
nations inflation rate is accounted for he said 
the yen and yendenominated investments have not benefited as 
much despite the rise in japanese interest rates thats mainly 
because japan is so dependent upon imported oil leading to concern 
about inflation eroding the value of the investments wyss said 
the slump in the japanese stock market hasnt helped matters he 
said 
wyss said the apparent lessening of the dollars safehaven 
status could turn out to be a blessing for the united states 
what we hope this will result in is a more stable dollar one 
that doesnt swing as much on these crises that is good not only 
for the us but for world financial markets he said 
a weaker dollar is not necessarily bad news it makes imported 
goods more expensive but us exporters should benefit because 
their products are now more competitive pricewise on world 
markets that could help ease the nations trade deficit

until 1971 its value was rigidly set first to a certain weight 
of gold and later to exchange rates of other major nations 
currencies but since then its price has floated determined by 
market forces 
each day hundreds of billions of dollars are bought and sold by 
traders in foreign exchange markets in exchange for currencies of

the dollar is subject to the same laws of supply and demand as

whats better a strong dollar or a weak dollar 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it depends a strong dollar makes americans cash go further 
overseas and reduces import prices generally good for us 
consumers and for foreign manufacturers 
but if the dollar is overvalued as nearly all economists agree 
it was in the early 1980s us products are harder to sell abroad 
where locally made goods may be cheaper and at home where they 
compete with lowcost imports that helped give the united states 
its recordbreaking trade deficit 
a weak dollar can restore competitiveness to american products 
by making foreign goods comparatively more expensive but too weak 
a dollar can spawn inflation first through higher import prices 
and then through spiraling prices for all goods 
worse a falling dollar can drive foreign investors away from 
us securities which lose value along with the dollar foreign 
investment is critically needed to help finance the large us 
budget deficit

through two basic ways exchangemarket intervention and by 
coordinating interestrate changes 
intervention is the direct buying or selling of currencies by 
central banks if the purchases are large enough that can 
influence prices directly when the fed or the bank of japan or 
the german bundesbank buys dollars directly that reduces the 
supply of dollars available and sends up the price 
changes in interest rates affect exchange rates more subtly but 
generally high interest rates in the united states compared with 
low interest rates abroad will attract money to dollardenominated 
investments that raises the value of the dollar 
investors will flock to where they can get the highest return

the national association of securities 
dealers plan to extend trading hours before dawn has been delayed 
by at least a month thanks to a regulatory snag 
nasd president joseph r hardiman said thursday that ongoing 
negotiations with the securities and exchange commission will push 
back the expected start of early hours trading from september until 
later in the fall 
the nasd which oversees the overthecounter market stocks 
that are traded through an electronic market system rather than a 
stock exchange planned to begin a trading session that started at 
330 am new york time next month 
the early start would allow members of the nasdaq automated 
stock quote system in the united states and britain to trade in 
more than 300 securities of us companies including about 70 now 
traded on the london international exchange before the markets 
opened in this country 
the move was seen as a step toward roundtheclock trading 
which many say is necessary to keep american markets competitive 
with those overseas 
but the sec wants more stringent transaction reporting which 
nasd fears will spook london traders who are used to reporting less 
information 
hardiman however said he was confident the difficulty could be 
overcome 
its a hurdle not a roadblock he said adding when youre 
the first organization thats trying to introduce an offshore 
market youre forging new ground and you have to deal with some 
rule and regulatory issues not all of which can be anticipated 
were dealing with this one with the sec were negotiating 
with them and i think well reach a suitable compromise he said 
he said he expected trading to begin sec officials could not be 
reached for comment 
hardiman explained that in the nasdaq system in this country 
every trade is reported and disseminated within 90 seconds of its 
execution but in the more thinly traded british market the stock 
ticker reports trades only after three minutes and in large block 
trades the information is held up for 90 minutes before it is 
disseminated 
nasdaq had planned not to issue data on every trade but to 
report price quotes and volume periodically which the sec said 
wasnt often enough for the protection of us investors

the federal national mortgage association says 
it will buy back up to 500 million of its securities to show 
managements confidence in fannie maes ability to ride out an 
economic downturn 
shares of fannie mae closed at 2662 thursday on the new york 
stock exchange down 12 cents the stock had been trading as high 
as 4375 on june 12 
fannie mae shares had traded as low as 24 before the company 
announced its plan to buy back common stock and warrants 
if we thought the companys future financial prospects were 
materially diminished by the current environment we wouldnt be as 
comfortable considering share repurchasing said timothy howard 
fannie maes chief financial officer 
shares in fannie mae the nations largest investor in home 
mortgages usually rise when interest rates fall and drop when the 
interest rate rises reflecting the mortgage industrys dependency 
on interest rate movement 
fannie mae is a publicly owned congressionallysponsored 
corporation that buys mortgages from lenders and resells them to 
investors 
officials of the washingtonbased corporation said the stock 
buyback reflects managements confidence in the companys financial 
position and future earnings power despite increasing signs of a 
pending recession 
we think the overall market in general and fannie mae in 
particular is down by far more than the companys financial 
conditions and prospects would warrant even if the economy were 
to enter into a recession with high inflation as seems to be the 
current concern said howard 
as of june 30 fannie mae had about 34 million warrants and 241 
million shares of common stock outstanding 
a warrant is a security that serves as an advance purchase for 
a lower price of an equal amount of stock to be issued later 
warrants are usually offered as an inducement or sweetener to 
investors to get them to buy accompanying fixedincome securities 
such as bonds 
to offset the buyback howard said fannie mae will be receiving 
up to 500 million in february from the conversion of the 
outstanding warrants 
we do not have a fixed time frame in mind he said 
he said buying back shares with the proceeds of exercised 
warrants was a fairly common technique for dealing with equity 
conversion 
in announcing the buyback fannie mae chairman david o maxwell 
repeated the companys plan to add between 2 billion and 25 
billion in capital by the end of next year 
the company has been criticized in the past for not having 
enough capital about 35 billion compared to its more than 
300 billion holdings in mortgages and mortgage securities to 
protect it in times recession or a real estate bust

donald trumps financial fate last 
week lay in the hands of two former state senators a former county 
clerk a retired irs administrator and an attorney 
those five people make up the new jersey casino control 
commission on tuesday they approved a byzantine financial deal 
that allowed trump to receive a 65 million emergency loan with his 
three atlantic city casinos put up as collateral 
the deal is no guarantee trump will succeed in his attempt to 
handle the 32 billion in debt he has amassed to build his 
fortunes here and in new york according to a report by the state 
division of gaming enforcement 
the commission is focusing on trumps overall financial 
stability with relicensing hearings moved up to october for all 
three of his casinos the hearings would come just before trump is 
scheduled to make a 47 million bond payment due nov 15 on the 
trump taj mahal casino resort 
as evidenced by this case the commissioners who each make less 
than 100000 a year command a great deal of power as written by 
the authors of the 1977 casino control act 
critics have long charged the commission with abusing that 
power but defenders say the commission has done its job keeping 
the casinos free of organized crime and fostering a climate that 
tries to balance everybodys interest 
casino executives lauded the appointment wednesday of steven 
perskie gov jim florios chief of staff as the new chairman of 
the commission his appointment returns acting chairwoman valerie 
armstrong to a commissioners role and replaces e kenneth burdge 
a former county clerk whose term expired 
perskie as a state senator from atlantic citys county helped 
to write the 1977 casino control act 
this is a very positive move for the industry and a very 
positive move for atlantic city said al glasgow publisher of 
the gaming newsletter atlantic city action and a consultant to 
trump he understands atlantic city 
aside from perskie these are the remaining players 
ms armstrong an atlantic county attorney and former 
admininstative law judge is generally credited within the industry 
with shifting the commission toward what they perceived as fairer 
treatment than that of her predecessor walter bud read 
ms armstrong who was appointed to the commission in 1985 is 
not an industry captive she told attorneys for trump that in 
essence they would have to persuade bankers to wait until tuesday 
for a commission ruling because the panel needed time to digest the 
thousands of pages of documents submitted by trump 
her ruling tuesday insisted that trumps casino licenses be 
examined in october months ahead of their spring due date 
commissioner frank j pat dodd is seen as a friend of the 
casino industry who acts as a lone voice on the panel 
his only questions during the hearings on trump were for new 
trump chief financial officer stephen bollenbach to evaluate the 
future of the casino industry 
dodd came to the commission in march 1989 after a varied career 
he served as a state senator from essex county state senate 
president failed democratic gubernatorial candidate in 1981 
chairman of the hazardous waste facilities siting commission a 
panel equal to the casino commission as a lightning rod for anger 
and owner of a string of bars along the shore 
commissioner w david waters appointed in 1986 is seen as the 
antithesis to dodd and a holdover from the read era he has been a 
strong advocate of ensuring that the 50000employee casino 
industry hires minorities and women 
his questions during the trump hearings asked pointedly about 
the absence of a plan detailing an expected trade by trump of part 
of his casino equity to reduce his debt 
he said he reluctantly voted to approve the deal tuesday and 
hoped trumps problems show other casinos the danger of piling on 
too much debt 
waters a camden county resident had been retired from his job 
as regional administrator of the internal revenue service when he 
was appointed to the commission in 1986 
james hurley is the most recent nominee coming aboard in 
december as the last appointee of the departing administration of 
gov thomas kean 
the former republican state senator from cumberland county has 
yet to carve out a role on the commission usually voting with the 
majority he was silent during the question part of the hearings

major airlines will meet next week to discuss 
international passenger fare hikes in response to soaring fuel 
prices caused by the persian gulf crisis an industry association 
said friday 
thirty to 40 major carriers from all over the world are expected 
at the threeday emergency conference starting wednesday in geneva 
the international air transport association said 
representatives will seek to set a new common fare policy seen 
as reasonable enough to gain quick approval by governments iata 
officials said 
industry sources said higher international fares are likely to 
start oct 1 at the latest one source who declined to be 
identified said fares could rise by up 10 percent 
crude oil prices have hit their highest levels in five years 
after iraqs occupation of kuwait and the un trade embargo 
against iraq insurance premiums for middle east flights have 
jumped as tension rose in the region 
insurance costs are to be discussed at the meeting one way 
airlines could pass on the increase to passengers is through 
insurance surcharges on middle east routes sources said 
whatever the big airlines decide at the iatasponsored meeting 
will effectively serve as guidelines for other smaller passenger 
carriers 
charter fares are expected to rise more sharply than those of 
scheduled flights because fuel accounts for a greater proportion of 
charter airlines costs 
iata is a group of 200 airlines in 122 countries

crisis 
light sweet crude was down 86 cents to 3107 per barrel on 
october contracts late morning on the new york mercantile exchange 
oil prices broke 30 a barrel this week for the first time since 
late 1985 
i think the market is reflecting here on the prospects of 
higher opec production said bob baker an analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries has declined 
to meet formally to discuss higher production in the wake of the 
international embargo of iraqi and kuwaiti oil but some producing 
states planned to meet on their own this weekend in vienna

september delivery thursday before settling at a recordhigh 
closing price of 1086 gasoline has set new record closing prices 
every day since aug 15 with prices at the pump also on the rise 
gasoline futures rose in part because of a fire and a leak at 
two texas refineries that were cutting back an already tight supply 
of petroleum products 
shell oil co said 165000 barrels of crude cannot be refined 
daily because of a fire at its plant in deer park texas although 
a spokesman was not sure how long repairs might take another shell 
spokesman said customers would be supplied through other plants 
also a leak at the crown central petroleum corp refinery in 
the houston area forced a partial shutdown that analysts said would 
probably not disrupt supplies for more than a day or two 
some analysts said the shortfall was significant in light of 
further potential declines in imports because of the middle east 
crisis

the british office of fair trading asked major oil 
companies friday to explain the increase in gasoline prices since 
the outbreak of the gulf crisis 
prices have risen from around 2041 pounds 398 a gallon on 
july 25 to 2178 pounds 424 a gallon this week thats a rise 
of 876 cents to 934 cents per liter 
the office of fair trading an arm of government that acts as an 
independent consumer watchdog said it asked shell esso bp 
texaco and mobil for an account of the impact which the current 
middle east crisis has had on the companies operations 
the oil companies said they welcomed the request because it 
would enable them to disprove allegations that they have been 
profiting unfairly from the rise in oil prices since iraq invaded 
kuwait aug 2 
they noted that the industry had already been investigated and 
cleared by antitrust agencies 
we will as usual cooperate fully with this request and we 
welcome the opportunity to help clear the air bp said 
shell said it is losing one million pounds 195 million a day 
on gas station sales because pump prices are failing to keep pace 
with oil price increases

would cut more jobs due to a shrinking military budget 
ge aerospace said it would eliminate 650 jobs in burlington by 
1992 and will close a facility in huntsville ala by the end of 
next year 
the alabama site employs 400 people and about half the workers 
will be offered jobs in daytona beach fla under a consolidation 
plan said terry dunn a ge spokesman 
last week ge aircraft engines announced it was eliminating 
1500 jobs from its plants in lynn mass and evendale ohio 
about onethird of those jobs will be lost through layoffs 
as with the previous announcement ge cited military spending 
cuts in its decision 
to stay competitive in a smaller and rapidly changing defense 
market we need to make the most efficient use of our manufacturing 
facilities and other resources mike smith vice president of the 
aircraft electronics division said in a statement 
products at the burlington plant include automated test 
equipment for such military vehicles as tanks and helicopters 
huntsville has served as a development site for an electronic test 
system for the navy 
under the new company structure burlington will focus on 
automated test equipment but other product lines will be 
transferred to other sites 
the cuts in burlington and huntsville will result largely from 
layoffs ge said but dunn said the company hoped to minimize the 
extent of layoffs through attrition and worker relocation 
ge said it would offer a severance package and would help 
employees find new jobs

ibm is expected to announce sept 5 plans 
for introducing new mainframe computers twice as powerful as the 
current systems a market research group said friday 
richard imershein senior vice president of stamfordbased 
gartner group inc said the announcement will come in two phases 
the sept 5 announcement will introduce upgrades for ibms 
highly successful 4381 line of minicomputers and a related family 
of smaller minicomputers the 9370 imershein said 
toward the end of next year he said ibm will announce new 
technology to replace the current systems and more than double 
their capacity 
the announcement on sept 5 will be the announcement of the 
move imershein said the first deliveries will basically be 
some new covers and some new frames and some new power supplies 
but the actual new machine itself we dont believe will come 
until the second half of 1991 
amos kermisch spokesman at the companys headquarters in 
armonk ny confirmed that ibm would be making a major 
announcement sept 5 and that mainframe computers would be part of 
that announcement 
the announcement will be made at ibms poughkeepsie ny 
plant which makes mainframes kermisch said 
were doing it where we manufacture large systems but theres 
something for just about everybody in the announcement he said 
kermisch declined to release details about the announcement 
imershein said gartner group believes ibm is making the 
announcement next month in response to competitive pressures from 
hitachi and amdahl corp which have been improving their mainframe 
product lines 
they really would have preferred to do it in the second half 
of 91 but they cant wait he said 
the bulk of ibms customers arent expected to leap quickly to 
the new mainframes imershein said 
the people who are at the front end who need the capacity 
will make the move he said the rest of them will kind of lay 
back and wait

data general corp which has repeatedly cut its 
payroll while trying to end a string of losses announced friday it 
would lay off more than 2000 additional workers over the next 
several weeks 
the announcement was widely expected by wall street analysts 
but some questioned whether the costcutting steps would allow the 
computer company to turn a profit 
because of the layoffs and accompanying severance payments the 
company will record a charge of approximately 70 million against 
the fourth quarter which ends sept 29 data general expects to 
suffer a loss in the quarter 
fridays announcement marked the sixth time the westboro 
massbased company has cut sharply into its work force since 1985 
the last year data general reported a profit 
since that year employment at data general has shrunk from 
17700 to its current level of 11700 which does not include 
fridays cuts 
data general like other massachusetts computer companies has 
suffered from declines in the market for midsize minicomputers 
data general has tried to revamp its product line marketing 
smaller desktop computer workstations part of the strategy is to 
make products that operate according to industry standards 
data general president ronald l skates said in a statement that 
the company now has the organization in place and the appropriate 
mix of employee resources to compete successfully in todays 
information technology marketplace 
that is a wellworn phrase from these guys said christopher 
mines an analyst with cowen amp co in boston 
analysts say the new products are performing well but they have 
not yet offset the continuing losses in minicomputers as a result 
overall revenues have remained weak 
for the first nine months of the current fiscal year the 
company had revenues of 907 million compared with 957 million 
for the same period a year ago 
data general also faces stiff competition for its new products 
and analysts say the company must show it can turn a profit in 
order to attract more customers 
its one of these spiral things mines said you erode 
customer confidence with every losing quarter that goes by 
data general says its primary goal is to become profitable 
todays announcement indicates we have to reduce costs said 
james dunlap a company spokesman but he added our hope is this 
will be the final time we will have a major reduction 
but as long as the revenues remain uncertain more costcutting 
steps might be needed said barry willman an analyst at sanford c 
bernstein in new york 
the company did not immediately specify where the layoffs will 
occur but dunlap said massachusetts where the company employs 
3200 will be among the areas largely affected

the united auto workers union on friday perused 
contract proposals from each of the big three automakers starting 
the process of choosing which company it will choose for 
negotiations in the next three weeks 
the uaw got the first comprehensive contract proposal from 
chrysler corp on friday the day after it received documents from 
general motors corp and ford motor co 
loosely speaking they are all in the american league if not 
the same ballpark a uaw source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said friday there are some conspicuous absences in 
the chrysler proposal gms is a slightly fleshier proposal than is 
fords 
the uaw and industry observers have been wondering if chrysler 
will be successful in breaking from the tradition of pattern 
bargaining and negotiate an agreement significantly different from 
that at the other two us automakers 
in pattern bargaining the uaw chooses one of the three 
companies reaches and agreement and in effect imposes it on the 
other two automakers 
chrysler on the shakiest financial ground of the big three has 
indicated it may not be able to afford a contract reached with the 
richer gm or ford but the uaw said it has no plans to break with 
the pattern bargaining tradition 
union and company officials publicly have declined to discuss 
the proposals details which doubtlessly will change in the days 
ahead each companys initial offer gives a broad idea of what it 
is seeking but is also an attempt to persuade the union to choose 
it as the uaw target company 
during the past week after visiting the main bargaining tables 
at each of the big three uaw president owen bieber has said the 
proposals will play major parts in next weeks decision of which 
company will become the target 
the uaw leadership meets monday and tuesday in detroit to choose 
a target widely believed to be gm 
the unions current contracts with the big three expire sept 14 
and cover more than 450000 active workers employees on layoff and 
retirees also covered by the contracts add thousands to the total 
the union has targeted job security as its overriding concern 
during this years negotiations companies have said they will be 
seeking increased flexibility of the work force and reductions in 
their health care expenses

motorists may be fuming as gasoline prices seem 
to get higher with every fillup but petroleum experts say 
consumers arent getting squeezed nearly as badly as they were a 
decade ago 
some contend oil prices would have to reach 60 a barrel and gas 
would have to hit 2 a gallon at the pump to make the situation 
analogous to the rapid rise in fuel costs in the months after the 
iranian revolution 
oil prices peaked in 1981 after the revolution and unleaded 
gasoline hit 142 per gallon at its height but federal 
statisticians indicate the pump price would have to climb to 198 
to reach the same real price today 
the american automobile association reported friday that prices 
at the pump had risen to their highest levels since the 1982 fourth 
of july weekend averaging 1274 nationwide for a gallon of 
selfserve regular unleaded thats up 37 cents since monday 
but its far below the 2 mark that would have to set in before 
gasoline could take an early 80sstyle bite out of the family 
budget 
between the days of peak gasoline prices and the current oil 
crisis fuel prices have dropped to their lowest level since the 
end of world war ii when adjusted for inflation 
its the cheapest time to propel a car for one mile its 
less than 5 cents said bill hermann chief economist with 
chevron corp company figures when adjusted for inflation 
indicate it cost 105 cents to drive a mile in 1980 and 8 cents in 
1960 
the energy information administration uses figures that indicate 
1988 was the cheapest year ever for gasoline 
even though nobody in the industry or the government seems 
willing to predict 2agallon gas the experts refuse to rule 
anything out oil prices shot past 30 a barrel this week for the 
first time since late 1985 in a futures market that has traded 
nervously since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
several experts contacted by the associated press said all bets 
would be off if the middle east standoff develops into combat that 
destroys oil facilities in saudi arabia which has the worlds 
largest known crude supply 
if we lost kuwaiti iraqi and saudi arabian oil there would 
be a real deficit hermann said youd have to cripple most of 
the saudi exporting facilities before that would happen that would 
imply a shooting war and we would take out iraqi facilities as 
well 
a clash of that magnitude could remove almost onefifth of world 
production from the markets he said 
hermann believes that real pump prices of gasoline wont move 
back up to 1981scale levels unless a fullscale war breaks out and 
the price of crude shoots up to 40 per barrel government 
statisticians estimated it would take a crude price above 60 a 
barrel 
those who follow the industry also point out that us consumers 
pay far less than their counterparts in most other nations gas in 
britain for instance was about 424 a gallon this week 
according to that governments office of fair trading 
but other observers say us consumers are paying far more for 
their energy as their tax money is used to pay for the deployment 
of the largest military force since the vietnam war 
the president of the national defense council foundation a 
washingtonarea think tank said that including the extra cost of 
the military buildup americans are probably paying more than 70 
per barrel of oil 
if hostilities break out youre talking about 100 a 
barrel milton copulos said 
despite the statistics that show pump prices are lower when 
adjusted for inflation a ralph nader consumers group buyers up 
accuses oil companies of gouging the public by being too quick to 
pass on price increases and too slow to pass on decreases 
oil companies in recent weeks have mounted a public relations 
offensive to dispel such accusations spokesmen for three major 
companies said friday they were glad the justice departments 
antitrust division was looking into pricing practices because they 
believe the probe will show the industry is playing fairly

the gasoline prices at edmond 
nassars arco station were stunning to ron and nancy sutton who 
needed some good news after a yosemite vacation interrupted by 
wildfires 
preparing for the last mountainous stretch back to los angeles 
they pulled off highway 99 on thursday to see it posted in big 
black letters unleaded gas 939 cents just down the road a 
texaco station was charging nearly 120 
but the low price wouldnt last later in the day atlantic 
richfield co said it would end a twoweek freeze and raise 
wholesale prices 2 cents per gallon on average to its dealers 
the company said it could no longer supply enough gas to meet 
demand for the lower prices 
that means arco the eighthlargest us oil company and largest 
gas marketer in the west has ended an action that not only 
increased its market share but yielded a rare public relations 
dividend at a time when other big oil companies were accused of 
gouging consumers 
iraqs invasion of tiny oilrich kuwait has caused prices to 
soar for both crude oil and gasoline a barrel of crude has risen 
from 21 to 30 while the price of unleaded regular gasoline 
increased from 1075 per gallon on aug 1 to 1237 this week 
according to a spot check of selfservice stations by the american 
automobile association 
arco was able to freeze prices because it normally gets 100 
percent of its crude oil from its own alaska operations eugene 
nowak the head of the energy research group at dean witter 
reynolds inc said that ready supply provided a cushion for the 
company as it decided to freeze prices 
arco considered a lowpriced marketer also relied on its west 
coast refineries and allself service stations to keep prices 2 to 
3 cents cheaper than competitors 
its wholesale prices had fallen as much as 13 cents per gallon 
below competitors in some markets since the iraqi invasion 
but those low prices caused a surge in sales volume that 
approached 20 percent by thursday overtaxing arcos ability to 
resupply many stations said george h babikian president of 
marketing and refining 
we had our refineries at capacity we were delivering every 
drop we could with our own fleet we were working people on 
overtime to exhaustion we hired every common carrier we could 
find and still we were running out at 150 to 160 stations a day 
sometimes for four hours babikian said 
babikian disputed suggestions that the companys price freeze 
was intended to curry favor with washington in hopes that more 
alaska land will be opened to exploration or that a return of a 
windfall profits tax on oil can be headed off 
i think our motive was very pure to help the president in 
this very difficult situation he said 
president bush appealed for voluntary price restraints following 
the invasion 
babikian said the plea sounded like a very reasonable request 
to us and so we did it to the extent that it generates good will 
in washington heck we need all the help we can get 
and the same thing goes for good will at the pump he said 
but those werent the reasons we did it 
scott jones a former arco staff economist who is now president 
of aus consultants in suburban philadelphia said he believes the 
freeze was intended to increase market share he said the move 
helped reassert arcos image as a lowprice leader and win good 
will for its corporate citizenship 
it also smooths the way for the introduction this fall of 
additional lowerpolluting fuels the new gasolines replacing 
unleaded varieties cost more to make and presumably will cost more 
at the pump 
its difficult to appeal to peoples sense of the environment 
at 130 a gallon where it would have been easy at 105 jones 
said but if anyone can do it arco can given the good will 
theyve generated 
but george baker an analyst with merrill lynch research in new 
york dismissed market share as a major reason for arcos action 
saying he believed the company was already satisfied with its 
inroads perhaps more important strategically to arco baker said 
was the hope it can help calm congressional critics accusing the 
oil industry of price gouging 
i think they at arco do want the oil business to be in a 
stable political and economic environment he said 
babikian said arco would not increase the wholesale price of its 
gasoline beyond increases in its refineries crude oil prices 
which he said track the world market 
now that arco has ended the freeze dealers in southern 
california arizona and nevada will pay up to 5 cents per gallon 
more for their stocks although company officials and dealers say 
arcos prices will still be the lowest around 
nassar the bakersfield dealer said arco had always supplies 
him gas cheaply enough to allow him to meet his goal beating or 
meeting the lowest priced competitors in town 
even with the price increase were still the lowest nasser 
said so we still have a great deal of room to play without 
losing our competitive edge

the stock markets depressed levels opened the 
door friday for a number of companies to launch or extend stock 
buyback programs 
ao smith corp which had suspended a share repurchase program 
in june 1989 said it was resuming stock buybacks the company a 
manufacturer of auto truck and farm equipment allocated 75 
million for the repurchases 
the toymaker hasbro inc said its board approved the buyback of 
up to 3 million shares western publishing group inc first 
illinois corp first financial holdings inc and bernard chaus 
inc were among other companies announcing stock buybacks friday 
other firms have already been in the market this week picking 
up their own shares at bargain prices on tuesday the investment 
firm bear stearns amp co repurchased 236 million shares of its 
stock when the price hit a 52week low 
ao smith vice president edward j oconnor attributed the 
timing of the firms resumption of its buybacks in part to the 
declines on wall street over the past month ao smith stock 
closed at 1487 friday up 25 cents in american stock exchange 
trading 
since the stock market reached an alltime closing high of 
299975 on july 17 the dow jones industrial average has fallen 
nearly 470 points as wall street was wracked by concerns about a 
recession in the united states and war in the middle east 
the dow jones average has dropped more than 366 points since 
aug 1 the day before iraq invaded kuwait the closelywatched 
index closed friday at 253292 up 4950 
the flurry of repurchase plans recalls the october 1987 stock 
market crash when firms including international business machines 
corp usx corp citicorp general motors corp and ford motor co 
began to scoop up their own shares at lower prices 
stock buybacks are popular among shareholders since repurchases 
reduce the number of shares available they tend to support the 
price of a companys stock and also enhance a firms balance sheet 
by raising its earnings per share 
dexter corp which also extended its stock repurchase program 
friday also wanted to provide a market for shareholders who wanted 
to unload their stock but couldnt 
there are times when there are virtually no buyers of the 
stock and we can provide liquidity for our stockholders who want to 
sell said dexter executive vice president robert e mcgill 
buybacks also represent a vote of confidence in a firm by its 
management which takes millions of dollars from corporate coffers 
to repurchase the shares 
the stock markets decline prompted penn central corp to lower 
the price on its tender offer for 10 million of its shares penn 
central said friday it would pay 23 per share instead of the 26 
it had offered earlier 
the company blamed the tensions in the middle east and the 
consequent deterioration in general market conditions including 
the market price for the companys common stock for the change in 
its offer 
penn centrals announcement also harks back to the 1987 crash 
when several tender offers or buyout plans were canceled or put on 
hold 
penn central stock closed friday at 2187 a share on the new 
york stock exchange up 12 cents 
and sun microsystems inc said it was withdrawing a planned 
stock offering because of deteriorating market conditions sun had 
announced plans for the offering earlier this month

oil prices fell back friday as traders saw 
little news from the middle east and decided to take their profits 
from a week of high prices that broke some records and tied others 
light sweet crude fell 102 per barrel to 3091 for october 
delivery on the new york mercantile exchange but never dropped 
below the 30 mark it hit wednesday for the first time since 
november 1985 
were really not down very much said bob baker an analyst 
with prudentialbache securities inc 
unleaded gasoline also closed lower friday down 389 cents to 
1047 per gallon for september delivery the drop broke a 
sevenday streak of record high closes that began aug 15 
later contract months were also down as were contracts for 
light sweet crude 
during the weeks trading crude matched its alltime high 
futures price of 3235 per barrel and unleaded gasoline set an 
alltime record of 111 per gallon both highs came thursday 
as the wild week came to an end analysts said the price of 
petroleum products including gasoline and heating oil had risen 
too high in proportion to the price of crude so they had been 
destined to fall 
products were under pressure simply from being exceedingly 
high baker said 
what we saw basically from the beginning of the day was 
profit taking said annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with 
shearson lehman brothers inc a lot of players wanted to take 
their profits for the weekend 
the closing price of crude oil friday was up 228 per 42gallon 
barrel for the week unleaded gasoline which traded above 1 per 
gallon on the merc for the first time ever on monday stayed above 
that level all week for an 87 cent increase on september contracts 
home heating oil closed at 9096 cents per gallon for september 
delivery down 527 cents for the day but up 1042 cents for the 
week 
natural gas closed at 1525 per 1000 cubic feet for october 
delivery down from 1545 on thursday but up from 1440 a week 
earlier 
although a lack of news from the middle east stirred concerns 
and uncertainties that sent markets soaring earlier in the week 
traders viewed fridays lack of major developments as a calming 
factor hittle said 
a day earlier traders had worried about the pending showdown as 
the united states refused iraqi demands that the embassy in kuwait 
be closed by friday iraq reportedly threatened friday that it 
would use force to remove the diplomats on saturday 
the fact that nothing happened eased things a bit hittle 
said although traders remain nervous about the possibility of 
military escalation the rising fuel costs have been taking their 
toll on motorists who see prices going up at the pump 
the american automobile association reported friday that its 
latest nationwide survey of pump prices showed an average price of 
1274 for a selfserve gallon of regular unleaded that was a 37 
cent rise since monday and represented the highest cost at the pump 
since the 1982 independence day weekend the aaa said

cattle futures prices slipped lower friday at the chicago 
mercantile exchange under continuing fears of a recession 
on other markets oil prices turned lower soybeans and wheat 
advanced while corn was lower and gold posted some minor gains 
cattle prices are vulnerable on a number of fronts and are now 
at the mercy of the mideast energy crisis and the potential for a 
recession said paul hare an analyst in chicago with linnco 
futures inc 
theres also some concern about the profitability for cattle 
prices this fall because of the extremely high prices that were 
paid for feeders in the early spring and midsummer he said 
the cash market isnt helping either with cash feeders falling 
2 to 5 per hundredweight on friday hare said 
in contrast pork futures showed some stability following a 
period of sharp declines in cash prices with the price for pork 
products on the decline traders were hoping these items would be 
featured at the meat counters and give a boost to demand 
cattle futures settled 25 cent to 75 cent lower with the 
contract for delivery in october at 7617 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 55 cent to 115 cents lower with august at 8817 cents 
a pound hogs were unchanged to 33 cent higher with october at 
4842 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 182 cents lower 
to 30 cent higher with august at 4190 cents a pound 
soybean futures prices advanced on the chicago board of trade 
after yesterdays strength nobody wanted to sell said 
mickey luth an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc the 
fundamentals were there to drive it higher 
he said bean prices are benefiting from lower carryover stocks 
reduced south american production and smaller amounts of competing 
crops 
grain prices on the other hand were weak 
they dont have the dynamics of soybeans said luth the 
corn supply is getting bigger not smaller and theres no risk of 
frost 
the latest 6 to 10day forecast calls for warm temperatures in 
the main corngrowing regions and luth said he feels confident the 
crop will make it past oct 1 and into the harvest season without 
suffering any severe frost damage 
wheat was 1 cent lower to 1 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in september at 284 a bushel corn was 1 cents lower 
to cent higher with september at 257 a bushel oats were 1 
cents lower to cent higher with september at 118 a bushel and 
soybeans were 1 cents lower to 5 cents higher with september at 
630 a bushel 
petroleum futures concluded a week of mideastinspired price 
increases with declines across the board at the new york mercantile 
exchange 
light sweet crude oil retreated 58 cents to 172 with the 
october contract settling at 3091 a barrel heating oil was 527 
cents to 594 cents lower with september at 9096 cents a gallon 
and unleaded gasoline was 205 cents to 444 cents lower with 
september at 10466 a gallon 
precious metals futures erased losses and settled for small 
gains on the commodity exchange in new york 
the decline in oil prices led to profittaking in the metals 
early in the session but the continuing fears over the middle east 
gave the market late support said stephen w platt an analyst in 
chicago with dean witter reynolds inc 
no one was really willing to commit in any big way one way or 
another he said 
gold settled 280 to 360 higher with the december contract at 
42320 a troy ounce and silver was 6 cents to 79 cents higher 
with august at 5187 a troy ounce

the stock market rallied and oil prices eased 
friday as the worlds battered financial markets staggered into the 
weekend optimistic that a middle east war had been averted for 
now 
but the recovery worldwide was based more on a belief that stock 
prices had bottomed out and oil prices shot up too rapidly over 31 
a barrel than on the latest tense developments in the iraqus 
standoff 
the fear from the selling has run its course like a fever runs 
its course and then breaks said christopher p baker of 
prudentialbache securities inc in boston maybe monday morning 
there will be some more panic but for the time being its gone 
on wall street the dow jones average rose 4950 points to 
253292 erasing most of a 76point drop thursday but the dow 
average which measures 30 big industrial company stocks still 
ended the week down 11188 points 
stocks also rebounded in europe and japan but despite the 
gains the crisis spawned by iraqs takeover of persian gulf 
neighbor kuwait has erased hundreds of billions of dollars in the 
value of us stocks 
the price of the main blend of us crude oil fell 102 per 
barrel to 3091 on the new york mercantile exchange crude peaked 
thursday after tying an alltime high during that trading day 
after iraq let a deadline pass for western countries to empty 
their embassies in kuwait many financial market participants 
traded as if the threat of an armed conflict had receded 
that occurred despite a barrage of accusations by the bush 
administration and the presence of iraqi troops around the us 
embassy in kuwait city 
significantly easing market worries soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev messaged iraqi leader saddam hussein indicating moscow 
would back western powers pressing for iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
and free foreign hostages 
the feeling was there might not be any conflict over this 
which was not the case before said james steel an oil analyst 
with refco inc a commodities trading firm in new york the 
psychology turned rather rapidly 
financial markets fear a desert war that could knock out oil 
production by world leader saudi arabia and drastically reduce 
world supplies making oil scarcer and more expensive that in turn 
would translate to higher inflation and economic instability 
worldwide 
in foreign exchange trading which is highly sensitive to 
political developments the dollar rebounded against major foreign 
currencies after falling in the previous sessions to new lows 
against the german mark swiss franc and british pound 
the dollar rose against the yen in new york at 14675 yen up 
from 14612 yen on thursday the british pound fell to 19400 
less expensive than thursdays 19570 against the mark the 
dollar rose to 15575 from 15445 
bond prices bucked the positive trend continuing to fall on 
concern over hostilities the governments 30year bond lost 219 
per 1000 in face amount while its yield climbed to 915 percent 
highest since april 1989 
stock markets worldwide posted gains japans nikkei stock 
average rose 42813 points to 2416576 a 18 percent rise after 
its fourthlargest drop ever thursday the frankfurt market gained 
about 38 points while londons stock exchange closed higher for 
the first time in seven trading days 
on wall street the dow jones average soared nearly 40 points in 
the first 15 minutes of trading before dropping back until an 
afternoon rally fed by gorbachevs comment and heavy buying by 
institutional and individual investors 
the markets very oversold this is a technical rally said 
manny geranimos head of block trading for shearson lehman brothers 
inc 
the stock market also was calmed by the stabilized dollar the 
foreign market rallies and the oil drop still traders noted the 
market remains down more than 460 points since reaching a historic 
peak july 17 a drop nearly as big as the october 1987 crash 
when we got down 500 in 1987 it was time to buy said james 
j cramer a new york money manager who said he made large stock 
purchases friday now were down 500 in 90 and maybe its time 
to buy again 
but he added i think were in a horrible bear market in all 
bear markets there are these moves upwards markets dont go down 
in a straight line

persian gulf paranoia overtook the bond market 
friday driving down prices and capping one of the worst weeks for 
investor confidence since the financial gyrations from the black 
monday crash three years ago 
the treasurys key 30year issue a sensitive barometer of 
interest rates and the economy fell 732 point or about 219 per 
1000 in face amount extending its loss for the week to more than 
22 
its yield which rises when the price falls reached 915 
percent the highest since april 12 1989 and an indicator that 
many investors dont want to tie up their money for such long 
periods by contrast many funneled money into 3month treasury 
bills to minimize the risk created by a possible mideast war 
investors were so emotional this week they really threw away 
their good common sense and were hanging on every minute 
development from the middle east said marshall b front 
economist at the stein roe amp farnham investment and mutual fund 
firm in chicago 
the bond and stock markets were driven by a level of 
emotionalism rarely seen since the stock market crash in 1987 he 
said investors in both stocks and bonds were looking at the 
worst possible scenarios 
bond strategists said prices strengthened early friday on 
internal market technical influences and the commerce departments 
gross national product report which showed the economy grew by 
only 12 percent in the apriljune quarter less than many 
forecasters had envisioned 
the gnp report suggested serious economic problems confronted 
the united states that required the need for lower interest rates 
which tends to boost the value of bond prices 
but the effect of the statistic quickly faded as investors 
refocused attention on rapid developments in the persian gulf 
where a showdown loomed between us and iraqi forces over iraqs 
seizure of kuwait on aug 2 
the financial markets have become obsessed with the persian gulf 
conflict because it has disrupted the flow of oil from the 
industrial worlds leading source of petroleum oil prices have 
reached fiveyear highs as a result threatening to tip the us 
economy into a recession 
although oil prices eased and stocks rallied a bit going into 
the weekend investment strategists said there was no trace of 
optimism in the bond market 
we did well on the gnp numbers but then the middle eastern 
blahs took over from there said micheal w casey international 
economist with ramirez capital consultants inc people are just 
very apprehensive 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments 116 point intermediate maturities fell 316 to 932 
point and longterm issues fell 732 point the telerate inc a 
financial information service reported
