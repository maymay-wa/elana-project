spurlock said on wusatv monday i would not lie in reference to 
the performance of my duty 
the washington post reported monday that barry was in a city 
hotel room with former city employee charles lewis on thursday when

with the roar of cars from interstate 87 behind 
him richard desimone had 25 city sixthgraders bend over to look in 
the mud for traffic of a quieter kind 
a muskrats been here he told them pointing out a pawprint 
with a line through it evidence of a muskrat dragging its tail 
desimone then showed them footprints made by a raccoon the children 
jockeyed for views 
in van cortlandt park an oasis in the bronx that has been home 
to animals ranging from snapping turtles to two whitetailed deer 
spotted last year desimone taught the children to be nature 
detectives and park stewards 
he is one of new york citys 68 urban park rangers a group of 
goodwill ambassadors that has educated tens of thousands of city 
dwellers about the nature around them 
the program in the nations largest city now in its 10th year 
has become a model park ranger programs have started in about 15 
cities including seattle philadelphia boston and cleveland the 
programs are independent from the national park service which 
oversees federal wilderness areas 
park rangers are such a welcome and comforting force in any 
park said mary kimmitt deputy director of the philadelphia 
ranger corps which started a year ago 
in some areas the presence of rangers helps keep down the crime 
rate in new yorks central park for instance the number of 
felonies dropped 28 percent in the last four years robberies alone 
fell 40 percent 
were trying to get people back in the parks said therese 
braddick director of new yorks urban rangers some people 
believe theyre not safe and at night many areas arent 
still while law enforcement in new yorks parks is handled by 
police and a 180member park patrol squad ms braddick said we 
provide a sense of security for people 
besides rangers show new yorkers that their backyard is not all 
concrete last year 84000 people attended 2618 educational 
programs held by the rangers 
when you think of manhattan the picture of beautiful park land 
doesnt come to mind ms braddick said 
and yet in this city of 8 million people there are 26000 acres 
of parks 
there are 30 species of ducks 10 species of owls 15 types of 
hawks and falcons red foxes snapping turtles raccoons skunks 
and occasionally deer from westchester county to the north the 
areas have about 30 types of endangered plants including the winged 
monkey flower 
new yorks first park bowling green was created in 1733 the 
city set aside land for central park in the mid1850s created the 
department of parks in 1870 and during commissioner robert moses 
tenure from 1934 to 1960 doubled park acreage 
there is little left to put aside now the city has filled its 
borders said park historian jonathan kuhn 
the end of major park expansion makes the current public land 
that much more important rangers say 
one place braddick loves to visit is pelham bay park in the 
bronx with its salt marsh mud flats 13 miles of rocky shoreline 
and 520 acres of forest 
herman barrocales 33 fished in brooklyns prospect park when he 
was a boy now he is a park ranger stationed there one of his jobs 
is to lead hawk watches 
on a crisp morning recently he passed around binoculars on a 
second story terrace in prospect parks boathouse he told the dozen 
people who came by that new york was a choice location to see hawks 
as it is on their fly path from canada to warmer spots 
in an hour five birds of prey were sighted including the rare 
peregrine falcon the falcon took its time in passing barrocales 
normally talkative barely said a word as he watched 
the children from ps 122 who visited van cortlandt park also 
were impressed by the wildlife around them 
after listening to desimones message that they should take care 
of the parks underscored as he picked up a plastic sixpack holder 
and broke its rings which can strangle ducks 11 yearold lanette 
romero said she had learned a lesson 
you should keep your eyes open make sure you dont harm 
animals and look for clues like footprints 
after school she was going to the library she said im going 
to find more out about muskrats

dozens of health care child care and family 
bills that died this year with the 100th congress are bound for 
resuscitation in 1989 their prospects at once better and worse than 
before 
on the plus side presidentelect bush repeatedly called for a 
kinder gentler nation during his campaign and proposed to spend 
more on child care health care education and homeless aid 
lawmakers are seizing on bushs interest to promote their own 
versions of child care and other social initiatives taking heart in 
what they view as a consensus on ends if not means 
on the other side of the coin is bushs pledge of no new 
taxes if he keeps that vow says one key lawmaker no social 
projects are likely to make it into the blueprint for fiscal 1990 
spending 
if the presidentelect will move on his position on tax 
revenues we can make room for some of these initiatives said 
rep leon panetta dcalif incoming chairman of the house budget 
committee if we could pick up half of a deficit reduction package 
in revenues as opposed to cuts we would make room he said that 
would amount to about 15 billion in new taxes 
the worst consequence of the deficit problem is that we are 
losing resources that could be devoted to social priorities 
panetta added were paying 166 billion in interest on the debt 
thats money thats not going for hunger housing nutrition and day 
care 
panettas senate counterpart tennessee democrat jim sasser 
stopped short of giving bush an ultimatum but indicated that without 
new tax revenues domestic spending increases will have to wait 
it may be possible to redirect some resources to some domestic 
needs sasser said speculating that dollars could be shifted from 
defense to education health care and infrastructure maybe not 
this year maybe not next year maybe the year after 
budget woes and philosophical splits over the last two years 
buried proposals to expand child care guarantee parental leave 
provide nursing home and home health care benefits increase the 
minimum wage require employersponsored worker health benefits and 
offer tax breaks to families with children 
all are certain to be back this year along with bushs campaign 
proposals and most will come through the house education and labor 
committee chaired by augustus hawkins dcalif who has a pledge of 
his own to promote anything his committee thinks will be good for 
the country cost be damned 
were just going to pass them and allow them the budget 
architects to adjust the budget in such a way as to pay for them 
hawkins said in an interview were not advocating anything we 
cant justify we think they will create earnings and reduce 
social costs in the long run 
but hawkins attitude is increasingly rare on capitol hill 
pay as you go is the rule we crossed that threshold with 
catastrophic health care said panetta referring to the 100th 
congress expansion of medicare coverage the program is being paid 
for by beneficiaries 
along the same lines house ways and means chairman dan 
rostenkowski dill said this month that members of his 
taxwriting committee are not going to endorse any new spending or 
revenuelosing proposal however meritorious unless it is included 
in a package that is selffinancing 
sen orrin hatch rutah the senior republican on the labor and 
human resources committee said a tax hike at least for some 
segments of society will be necessary to finance new social programs 
if bush and congress do not cut spending 
what weve got to do is find offsets he said were going 
to have to make priority choices between competing programs were 
going to have to get the money from some that arent really that 
important 
but hatch who chaired his committee when the gop controlled the 
senate conceded most programs are wellintentioned and many work 
well short of cuts to offset new spending he suggested that a 
multibillion dollar childcare program might for example be 
financed by a new tax on major corporations 
the tax would be imposed on the theory that they should be 
leading out in this area hatch said we could alleviate the tax 
if they do something for child care the workforce is diminishing 
its in their best interest to get involved 
among the major social initiatives expected in the 101st congress 
child care democrats will reintroduce their 25 billion act for 
better child care designed to subsidize day care for lower income 
people and bring care up to minimum federal health safety and 
staffing standards bush has proposed a 22 billion plan to expand 
head start make the dependent care credit available in the form of 
a refund to those who owe no taxes and give a tax break to 
lowincome families with young children whether or not they are in 
day care a middleground bipartisan proposal may be forthcoming 
from the senate finance committee 
health care competing needs include longterm nursing home care 
a pet project of new senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine longterm home care pushed by rep claude pepper dfla 
and health insurance for the 37 million americans who dont have it 
on the last bush has proposed letting people buy into medicaid 
but some congressional heavyweights including sen edward kennedy 
dmass and rep henry waxman dcalif want all employers to 
provide coverage which would help twothirds of those now 
uncovered rostenkowski for his part has said there is no way 
congress can take care of longterm care and the uninsured in one 
session 
family leave bush has said women shouldnt have to worry about 
losing their jobs if they take time off to care for new babies 
thats far short of congressional proposals that would require 
businesses to give leave to both parents to care for newborn newly 
adopted or seriously ill children to employees with serious medical 
problems themselves and in one case to employees to care for ailing 
relatives but some lawmakers are optimistic about a compromise 
given bushs interest in the issue 
minimum wage efforts to raise the minimum wage stalled in the 
100th congress over president reagans insistence on linking any 
hike to the creation of a subminimum training wage bush also favors 
a subminimum wage but has not been specific about to whom it would 
apply kennedy a prime mover on the issue believes there may be 
room for negotiation and a chance for early passage 
education bush has proposed a 500 million merit schools program 
to reward schools that get good results from largely disadvantaged 
student bodies he also has proposed a 50 million fund to spur the 
establishment of magnet schools 
homeless bush said in the campaign that the mckinney act 
designed to help the homeless should be fully funded for the first 
two years of the act congress released only 713 million of an 
authorized 11 billion this year congress appropriated 378 
million for the homeless act considerably less than the auhorized 
ceiling of 634 million

president carlos salinas de gortari has kicked 
a political hornets nest by suggesting the roman catholic church 
technically illegal in mexico since 1917 be restored to normal 
status 
the constitution ratified in that year by the triumphant forces 
of the mexican revolution went beyond separation of church and 
state it denied the church legal existence and tried to eliminate 
church influence 
mexico remains the most catholic country in the hemisphere 
nonetheless and the church has not faded every year millions of 
people take part in public processions to the basilica of the virgin 
of guadalupe the countrys patron saint 
salinas acknowledged reality by declaring in his inaugural speech 
dec 1 that a modern state deals openly and modernizes its 
relationship with unions business groups news organizations 
and the church 
it was the first time in modern mexico a president publicly 
acknowledged the church as part of society sitting in the gallery 
for the first time were representatives of the church cardinal 
ernesto corripio ahumada four other bishops and papal nuncio 
girolamo prigione the popes ambassador 
church leaders welcomed the move and conservative parties said 
they favored a debate to redefine the churchs role critics said 
the government should stick to the constitution 
salinas institutional revolutionary party which has controlled 
the government since it was founded 60 years ago was torn between 
supporting him and loyalty to the constitutions framers 
congresswoman socorro diaz said the reopening of a debate 
settled by history does not strengthen national unity and 
creates disagreement and confrontation among mexicans she is 
director of el dia a newspaper sponsored by the partys left wing 
some saw the presidents move as an effort to widen support for 
his government while his party is losing traditional backing from 
labor and the middle class 
the issue does divide the opposition during a debate in 
congress conservatives shouted fanatic robespierre and 
son of lenin at leftwing members who opposed the reassessment 
an officially anticlerical government leading a largely catholic 
population is one of mexicos contradictions the government ignores 
technical violations of the law by the church in order to maintain 
social peace 
one paragraph in article 130 of the constitution says the law 
does not recognize the religious associations known as churches 
in the eyes of the peasant union and military revolutionaries 
who wrote it the church was part of an oppressive landowning 
establishment to the hierarchy they were godless destroyers of 
established order 
churches cannot own property and the government has the power to 
determine the number of priests in each state foreign priests are 
prohibited from working in mexico and public displays of religion 
are forbidden 
priests do not have the right to vote but do so they are not 
allowed to speak or write about politics or the government but 
write opinion columns they are barred from teaching but the 
catholic church runs schools and universities where the children of 
government leaders study 
presidents hold private meetings with bishops 
two million people attended a mass in mexico city conducted by 
pope john paul ii he spent a week in mexico during his first trip 
to america 
in the late 1920s catholics conducted the cristero revolt 
because of government persecution a church hero was the rev miguel 
pro a jesuit priest executed by the government who was beatified 
in november 
a few days after the salinas inaugural interior minister 
fernando gutierrez barrios caused frontpage headlines by declaring 
the church exists and since then the debate has covered acres 
of newsprint 
in congress popular socialist party member alfredo reyes 
contreras said even the presence of prelates at the inauguration had 
violated the mexican constitution he demanded an investigation 
a leader of the unified socialist party gilberto rincon 
gallardo a catholic said change is needed because the current 
situation stimulates fanaticism 
the popular and unified socialist parties both belong to the 
democratic front coalition that supported cuauhtemoc cardenas 
against salinas in the july 6 presidential election 
salinas should be able to get the twothirds vote he needs in 
congress to change the constitution if he wants to do so his party 
controls 60 of 64 senate seats and although it has only 260 of 500 
lower house seats it can expect support from the conservative 
national action partys 101 members

shoppers with visions of afterchristmas sales dancing in their 
heads jammed malls across the nation monday as gifts were traded 
from california to new jersey but bostons famed bargain basement 
wasnt booming 
the day after christmas is one of the biggest shopping days of 
the year and this year retailers reveled in a happy coincidence 
that gave most people the day off to return gifts and swarm around 
sale tables 
its packed itll be maxed out today said lora dubbs 
manager of the 269store galleria in the los angeles suburb of 
glendale the malls department stores opened two hours early at 8 
am she said 
in san diego county dressingroom lines were so long at the 
nordstroms department store in the north county fair mall that men 
took their bargain duds to the mens restroom to try on 
in indiana stores were packed with shoppers looking for deals 
and returning gifts that werent quite right returns increase at 
least tenfold the day after christmas said rod rumrill manager of 
the brownsburg k mart 
in minnesota consumers were welcome to make returns with few 
questions asked said george hite a spokesman for target stores in 
minneapolis 
returned items ranged from clothing to telephone answering 
machines hite said 
what happens with answering machines is people realize 
nobodys calling them said hite we get a lot back 
new jersey shoppers lined up early at stores to return christmas 
gifts and to take advantage of sales in the postyuletide rush 
this is one of the biggest shopping days of the year tied 
with thanksgiving said mary kitsos assistant mall manager at the 
bergen mall in paramus 
in michigan consumers looking for a better fit kept some stores 
busy 
those misfit gifts are coming back said randy boadway 
manager at meijers thrifty acres in northville 
crazy is how k mart employee lynn berglund described the 
activity at a store in kingsford most people seemed to be sweeping 
up holiday items at bargain prices berglund said wrapping paper 
was most popular 
but in boston cashiers at filenes basement looked disappointed 
when the expected crowds failed to materialize at the famed bargain 
mecca by noon monday 
i kind of look forward to them said nelda scott referring 
to the traditional postholiday shopping crowd it can be fun if 
the customers are nice 
store clerks said that the confusion over store hours monday may 
have contributed to the lesser turnout a judge ruled last week 
against retailers who sought permission to open all day monday 
although filenes and other stores around bostons downtown 
crossing appeared quieter than normal other shopping malls in the 
region reported good turnouts 
the stores picked up around noon said beth chase a clerk at 
bloomingdales at the chestnut hill mall i think a lot of people 
got up late had brunch and then went shopping 
but some store managers already had their minds on other holiday 
happiness to sell 
valentines day goes up tomorrow said joann demilner 
manager of galas hallmark in suburban detroit

on school days 9yearold jamie swartz 
takes her lunchbox and books and joins the world of children she 
giggles with her classmates and makes drawings for display on the 
family refrigerator 
and then she returns to a world of adult rules where she is not 
welcome 
the adultsonly condominium where she moved in to live with her 
father as her mother lay dying of cancer has become an unfriendly 
place following the condo boards decision to force the child off 
the premises by jan 10 
the impact of the viewpointe condominium boards order has 
spilled beyond the creamcolored stucco buildings that overlook a 
manmade pond and the rear of the shopping center in this inland 
community 30 miles north of miami 
in florida second only to hawaii in the number of condo 
dwellers the girls plight has rallied critics of condo 
commandos who zealously enforce their rules 
attorneys and condominium directors are watching the controversy 
with interest a federal antidiscrimination housing law outlawing 
many adultsonly communities is set to take effect in march 
i understand the perception this case has said douglas 
neway an attorney representing the viewpointe board but the rule 
is no children and they have a right to enforce that rule 
this place is run like the gestapo said jamies stepmother 
jill swartz you can always make an exception 
the girls stepmother and father lynn are seeking a buyer for 
the twobedroom condominium while the board threatens to begin 
eviction proceedings 
so far there have been no bids for the 56000 unit which the 
couple purchased three years ago for about 50000 
i think the publicity has hurt us who wants to buy a place 
where they think the neighbors dont try to work with you said 
ms swartz 
jamie moved into the complex in april after her 42yearold 
mother maye swartz was hospitalized with cancer the condo board 
voted in july to allow jamie to stay until her mother finished 
chemotherapy she died in september 
as the jan 10 deadline nears the swartzes are preparing to 
fight 
we cant afford to pay a mortgage on two homes said ms 
swartz if we ever want to get a little house on a street with 
children for jamie then we cant walk away from this place 
believe me wed like to leave said ms swartz who doesnt 
allow the girl to talk to reporters jamie walks through the 
complex and no one will talk to her shes been brave but its 
still rough for a little girl whos been through what she has 
many of the swartzes neighbors were sympathetic to the familys 
dilemma but none would give their name for fear of irritating the 
condo board whose members are elected from the complex 
shes a quiet little girl who doesnt bother anyone said a 
woman living next door what ever happened to helping people out 
in time of crisis i guess thats oldfashioned 
if a court battle ensues several factors are working in the 
couples favor said harvey koppell an attorney who offered free 
assistance to the swartzes 
koppell said the viewpointe bylaws allow exemptions from the 
adultsonly rule in addition the condo board may be forced to 
accept jamie when the federal fair housing amendment act takes 
effect march 12 
the new provisions ban age discrimination with the exception of 
subsidized facilities for the elderly or in complexes where all 
occupants are 62 or older or if 80 percent of the units have one 
resident at least 55 years old 
i dont think they are even close to meeting one of the 
exemptions said koppell 
neway said he believes the complex may fulfill the 55yearold 
exemption but no surveys have been taken 
the concept of adultsonly living is well accepted in florida 
where legions of retirees seek friends their own age and a respite 
from the noise of children 
but fears from some condo directors that the swartzes stalemate 
will be replayed elsewhere may be unwarranted said attorney gary 
poliakoff author of the law of condominium operations 
retirement communities are generally built in areas not near 
schools and other services said poliakoff whose fort lauderdale 
firm represents 1600 condo associations across the country there 
are no facilities designed for children how many families do you 
think will want to live in an adultonly setting 
some who have chosen to fight the adultsonly trend in florida 
have lost in 1977 a couple was forced out of their tamarac 
condominium after having a baby the unsuccessful age discrimination 
suit went as far as the florida supreme court

when pan am flight 103 crashed last week 
claiming more than 280 lives the reaction was one of virtual 
universal horror but the death toll was only a small fraction of 
the number of children under 5 who die almost unnoticed each day 
from hunger and disease 
if christmas day was typical about 38300 such children from 
poor countries died according to new estimates released by the 
united nations childrens fund 
put another way the death toll from the pan am flight is equaled 
every 10 minutes or so in terms of children aged 5 and under 
these figures are derived from unicefs calculation that 14 
million children under age 5 died in 1987 partly because so many 
countries in latin america asia and africa impoverished by debt 
and other factors are cutting back on social services 
unicef executive director james grant said last week that 3 
million of these children died last year because they didnt have 
50 cents worth of vaccine in them 
the situation apparently has changed little and may have even 
worsened in 1988 the world bank reported last week that poorer 
countries are transferring their wealth to richer nations at record 
levels this year 50 percent higher than 1987 
the bank said the 17 most highly indebted countries of the third 
world will give wealthy countries 311 billion more than they 
receive triple the amount of 1983 crushing debt repayments mean 
less money left over for imports of basic human necessities such as 
food and medicine 
no region has been harder hit than latin america where per 
capita income is 8 percent below 1980 levels 
the interamerican dialogue a gathering of concerned citizens 
from throughout the hemisphere said in a recent report the social 
consequences of latin americas prolonged depression have been 
multiplying 
the people of latin america have seen their wages fall and 
their jobs disappear their housing schools hospitals and other 
public services have deteriorated and they have endured food 
shortages and mounting street crime 
financially strapped governments have been unable to address 
such fundamental social problems as the vast gap between rich and 
poor the deep poverty of rural areas and city slums widespread 
malnutrition and high rates of infant mortality the report said 
presidentelect bush seems to be aware of the problems that the 
13 trillion debt burden is causing third world countries since 
his election bush has met with the presidents of mexico and 
argentina and the incoming president of venezuela all countries 
where foreign debt is a major political and economic issue 
two days before release of the unicef report bush left the 
impression that his administration is likely to ask commercial banks 
to ease the debt burden of developing countries 
bush said the issue should be subject to a major review which 
will include not just the treasury but our national security people 
because weve got enormous problems particularly in our own 
hemisphere on third world debt 
us policy on the debt issue was spelled out in september 1985 
by then treasury secretary and now secretary of statedesignate 
james a baker iii 
his proposals for restoring growth in latin america and elsewhere 
call for a combination of economic reforms in the debtor countries 
and new public and private lending to meet their capital needs 
but as the interamerican dialogue report points out latin 
american governments have lost confidence in the baker approach 
because it has not produced the resources it promised 
many now see debt relief to reduce the regions financial 
obligations and massive capital outflows as the only way for latin 
america to escape its economic bind the report said 
to unicefs grant the link between debt and child mortality is 
obvious he said that in 16 of the most debtburdened countries the 
number of childhood deaths in the last 12 months is approximately 
650000 more than would have been the case if the 197080 rate of 
decline in under5 mortality had continued

square 571 is the name given by the 
government to a 43000squarefoot federal building that sits vacant 
in the middle of the district of columbia footsteps away from a 
homeless shelter which lately has been turning away 50 to 75 people 
a night 
a law passed in mid1987 directed the federal government to make 
its underutilized property available to the homeless but square 
571 was beyond the grasp of homeless advocates 
the reason the federal government interpreted underutilized 
to mean partially occupied not vacant 
under that reading of the law only 12 of the us governments 
properties uncle sam owns 429959 buildings and 727 million acres 
of land were deemed suitable for the homeless 
of those two a post office in lynn mass and an office 
building in bell calif have actually been devoted to that 
purpose since passage of the mckinney homeless assistance act in 
july 1987 
these facts outrage homeless advocates who have sued the 
government to force it to make more of its underused and unused 
properties available 
on sept 30 us district judge oliver gasch ruled in the 
advocates favor noting its unreasonable to suggest that 
congress chose to lease to the homeless halfempty properties and 
properties which are used part of the time but no properties which 
are wholly unoccupied 
pitifully few of the numerous unused federal properties are 
being evaluated for their suitability to assist the homeless 
gasch wrote in the decision those that are found to be suitable 
are not being made available to homeless providers 
gasch forbade the federal government from selling or transferring 
any of its excess or surplus properties until it has complied with 
the law 
currently the government has 335 excess or surplus properties 
ranging from a threestory federal office building in downtown 
providence ri to a vacant school in phoenix 
excess property is defined as that which isnt needed by the 
government agency which controls it while surplus property isnt 
needed by any federal agency at all according to earl jones 
commissioner of the general services administrations property 
resources service normally when a piece of federal property is 
declared excess it is turned in to the gsa which can offer it to 
other federal agencies or state or local governments or sell it on 
the open market jones said 
two months after gaschs ruling no more federal properties had 
been leased to the homeless and the parties to the lawsuit went back 
to court the national coalition for the homeless asked for a 
timetable for the government to comply charging that the department 
of housing and urban development was trying to stall 
gasch has given the government until wednesday to review half its 
335 surplus and excess properties to determine suitability for the 
homeless and until jan 12 to assess the other half if it doesnt 
finish on time gasch could find the government in contempt 
asked what the government had been doing in the two months since 
the judges initial ruling james stimson the assistant on homeless 
policy to the secretary of hud said officials were reviewing the 
list and revising the criteria for deciding which properties would 
be suitable for the homeless 
thereve been no major changes he said some additional 
factors were added recently 
those factors were to allow for exclusions of properties in flood 
plains or near hazardous or toxic waste sites or near explosive 
materials he said 
i find that an example of exercise in the absurd spending two 
months to make that change said maria foscarinis attorney for 
the national coalition for the homeless they wasted over two 
months as far as i can tell 
foscarinis said she believed the government was looking for ways 
to exclude more of the properties on the list and was only prevented 
from coming up with more loopholes because they were subjected to 
very close scrutiny by a congressional committee and by us 
stimson denied the allegation 
stimson said hud had identified three properties on the list of 
335 suitable for the homeless and two unsuitable gsa had 
recommended that hud look at those particular properties because 
they might fit the bill stimson admitted 
those that were deemed suitable were the john fogarty federal 
building in providence which is partially occupied a federal 
building in smithfield nc which is fully occupied by the 
department of agriculture and about five acres of land known as the 
raritan depot in new jersey 
those that were excluded a group of buildings at fort hayes in 
columbus ohio because they are structurally unsound and a former 
missile testing site in dade fla because its in a flood plain 
those recommendations have been sent back to the gsa stimson 
said

two toplevel jobs energy secretary and drug czar both 
cabinetlevel posts remain open

brushed aside any criticism of the sport 
asked whether quail hunting was humane bush replied jokingly 
the way i shoot it its very humane 
he also said there were some ferocious aggressive birds there 
if these birds if theyre not as we call harvested in the 
conservation movement why then theres an oversupply that results 
in terrible famine and imbalance in nature so i will try to 
contribute to this ecological balance

you and make your joys mount in his name 
mrs bush told reporters that her present from the 
presidentelect was just what i asked for a computerized 
dictionary 
asked what she gave her husband mrs bush replied a big fat 
kiss

full cabinet post was applauded by members of congress and labor 
leaders sen edward kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor 
and human resources committee called mrs dole an excellent

detectives were recalled from a planned 
undercover drug buy from a former city employee in a hotel room 
where mayor marion barry also was present according to a published 
report today 
the washington post said in its report that it was not 
immediately able to determine who called the officers back or why 
the detectives went to the hotel thursday to investigate a 
complaint from hotel officials that former city employee charles 
lewis had offered drugs to a hotel maid they left the hotel after 
somebody called them back downstairs the post reported quoting 
city government sources 
an internal police investigation is under way in an effort to 
determine whether lewis was involved in any drug activity how 
police handled the complaint and why the mayor was at the hotel 
sources said barry is expected to be interviewed as part of the 
probe 
traces of cocaine were discovered in the room at the hotel 
located in the northwest section of the city and an unnamed 
district source said barry visited the hotel six times last week 
but the chemical tests did not indicate whether the cocaine had 
been in the room recently barry has denied any wrongdoing 
i would never knowingly associate with anybody using drugs or 
dealing with drugs the mayor said through a spokesman under no 
circumstances would i associate with anybody doing this 
the detectives who backed off from the undercover drug buy were 
working out of the 3rd district under deputy chief edward j 
spurlock sources told the post assistant chief issac m fulwood 
told officers that spurlock offered to lie to reporters who called 
him about the actions of the detectives including stating falsely 
that no detectives from his district responded to the hotel the 
paper reported

the vicechairman of the senate intelligence 
committee says the possible presence of a cia operative on the pan 
am jet that crashed last week probably would not by itself have 
provoked a terrorist attack 
sen william cohen rmaine said sunday on abcs this week 
with david brinkley that he could not confirm whether the cia 
agent had been on the flight 
but cohen said that even if the agent had been aboard it would 
not necessarily be significant because terrorists could have 
eliminated him by direct assassination on the ground 
i dont think you can draw any connection one way or another at 
this point cohen said 
the fbis executive assistant director oliver revell on sunday 
denied earlier reports that the cias station chief in beirut 
lebanon was aboard the pan am jumbo jet that crashed last week in 
scotland he declined to say however whether any other cia 
operatives were on the plane 
we cannot comment on intelligence community personnel but i am 
authorized to say that the station chief in beirut was not on that 
aircraft he said in an interview with cbs radio 
two government officials speaking on condition of anonymity had 
said saturday that the cias chief in beirut was among the 258 
people aboard the aircraft 
contacted again sunday one of the officials reiterated to the 
associated press that the station chief who has not been publicly 
identified had been a passenger on pam am flight 103 investigators 
are viewing the crash as the possible result of sabotage 
revell was interviewed by cbs reporter lesley stahl following his 
appearance with stahl on the networks face the nation there 
was no discussion of this aspect of the crash on the television 
program 
in the postprogram interview revell was asked whether any us 
government employee from beirut had been aboard the illfated flight 
yes he replied the regional security officer from the 
state department was on the aircraft unfortunately 
on friday the state department said that three of its people 
were on flight 103 matthew k gannon of orange calif ronald 
lariviere of holyoke mass and daniel e oconnor of boston 
gannon was identified by the department as a political officer at 
the us embassy in beirut the others were identified as security 
officers lariviere in beirut oconnor in nicosia cyprus 
cia agents frequently use embassy positions as covers for their 
operations overseas 
revell said investigators are pursuing at least three possible 
causes for the crash a bomb planted by terrorists a bomb placed 
aboard by someone acting on a personal level wanting to kill a 
particular passenger and structural breakup of the aircraft

a torch singer who crooned at the 
fanciest clubs of paris and new york says shes never been happier 
now that shes helping the downandout find food and shelter in 
this industrial city 
this is my home patricia rainey said from her office at 
prospect house a united way agency founded by activist abbie 
hoffman two decades ago to help minorities i love this job 
because i get a lot out of these people 
raineys stage talents are put to use presenting the agencys 
work to 50 corporations yearly and helping an average 150 clients a 
month with things like filling out tax forms and finding jobs 
it wasnt an easy transition says her boss and halfbrother 
paul who lured her from new york a decade ago 
our clients come to us with eviction notices the day before 
theyre going to be evicted or for food the day before they run out 
of food theyre always going to be at the bottom of the ladder 
he said pat was just not prepared for that 
rainey 58 grew up in comfort in the 1930s her father julian 
d rainey was an attorney for the city of boston and worked as 
campaign manager for the minority vote on the presidential campaigns 
of franklin d roosevelt and alfred e smith 
while attending boston and northeastern universities she sang in 
clubs on weekends 
i worked all the little joints and i was a beautiful thing 
she said i was also pretty gullible i went for the okeydokey 
all the time even though i didnt have to because people would have 
hired me anyway i always thought of myself as a secondclass 
citizen because i was black 
her father encouraged her even placing newspaper ads to promote 
her appearances and in the early 1950s she graduated to new york 
nightclubs where she met a man who introduced her to drugs 
i didnt know he was a junkie she said he called somebody 
and told him to bring him the works i didnt even know what works 
were then he was putting something in his arm and i said well 
give me some too youre not going to leave me out 
soon she said she was in jail for prostitution and her father 
refused to bail her out he let me rot in detention for a month 
he knew what he was doing 
she kicked her drug habit while in prison and went to europe 
after her release to sing in the paris nightclub of fighter sugar 
ray robinson actress simone signoret was among those who saw her 
sing signorets recommendation to friends in london led to jobs 
there at the stork room the embassy club and cafe de paris 
also among raineys admirers was actress ruth gordon whose 
husband garson kanin gave her a part as a rich maid in a play that 
starred peter sellers the play flopped and rainey moved to a rome 
nightclub where she occasionally chatted between songs with king 
farouk of egypt 
all the time however her heart wasnt in the job 
in actuality she was never interested in a singing career 
said her brother who managed her career briefly shed feign 
interest because i was interested and my father was interested 
she left europe to tend to her dying father in 1957 
eventually she wound up in new york middleaged overweight and 
depressed her brother persuaded her to move to worcester 
like most prospect house employees rainey first was a client 
seeking help with her taxes she was one of only two dozen workers 
when she joined the agency eight years ago it has since grown to 
235 employees 
the talent that helped her attain success as a torch singer helps 
her keep others from despair 
when someone comes in i try to make their day a little 
brighter they come in you sit them down give them a doughnut 
make them feel theyre human she said

for nearly two months legs diamond has been 
the talk of broadway even though the lavish peter allen musical 
hasnt officially opened the conversation hasnt been encouraging 
the show about the notorious new york gangster played by allen 
finally premieres tonight after endless previews two postponements 
and a major overhaul that its producers hope will save the 5 
million musical 
we just want to make it work said arthur rubin one of the 
shows producers a group that also includes the nederlander theater 
organization and new york yankees owner george steinbrenner i 
didnt care how many times we had to postpone we would do it until 
we got it right 
getting it right has meant making drastic changes in front of 
difficult demanding new york audiences because of the shows 
elaborate sets the producers bypassed an outoftown tryout in 
favor of preview performances in new york after all allen who 
also wrote the shows book and lyrics had had successes in new york 
with his revues on broadway and at radio city music hall 
so much attention has focused on legs diamond because it is 
the only musical of broadways meager fall season that fact enabled 
the show to accumulate a 10 million advance mostly from theater 
parties 
legs diamond is also an american musical a homegrown 
product with a highly visible star and creator 
the previews which originally were slated to start oct 18 at 
the mark hellinger theater were delayed a week because of technical 
problems with the mammoth and complicated sets 
the first preview ran more than three hours many theatergoers 
walked out after the first act it was a scene repeated during most 
early previews 
the audience reaction was not too great rubin recalled 
diplomatically there were a lot of things to fix 
i didnt need anybody to tell me said director robert allan 
ackerman i had a very clear picture of what was wrong 
the opening scheduled for dec 1 was postponed first to dec 11 
and then to dec 26 
once previews were under way ackerman developed what amounted to 
a weekly game plan to improve the musical he would meet with author 
harvey fierstein choreographer alan johnson and allen usually 
after the sunday matinee and decide what they wanted to accomplish 
in terms of rewrites 
on monday the companys day off fierstein and ackerman would do 
the rewrites on tuesday the company would rehearse the new 
material and as much as possible of it would go into the show that 
night on wednesday the company would play two shows on thursday 
the company would learn more new material and play it that night and 
throughout the weekend on sunday the cycle would begin again 
the part that is the most frustrating is that invariably we 
would know that on tuesday we would be unraveling the whole thing 
again ackerman said but each change we did made the show 
better we could feel the show getting better and better 
the fix involved cutting some 45 minutes from the show 
eliminating characters throwing out sets and songs and writing and 
staging an entirely new opening number when i get my name in 
lights which features allen atop a huge electric sign announcing 
the shows title the changes boosted production costs from 42 
million to 51 million 
among the characters jettisoned were legs diamonds wife and 
brother played by christine andreas and bob stillman 
nobody was let go because they werent doing a wonderful job 
ackerman said i think the remarkable thing about this whole 
process is that we have gone through what is regarded as the most 
hellish thing you can live through in the theater the making of a 
musical and there has been no animosity at all 
for allen the previews were incredibly difficult rubin said 
there was a lot of pressure the producer added he was 
performing rehearsing and trying to write a new song all at the 
same time 
major changes were stopped a week ago to give the cast time to 
play the same material 
i hope we fixed it all ackerman said i can tell you now 
that the audience reaction is tremendous and people are really 
loving but whether or not it will be a hit i dont know

the earth influenced world events in 1988 more 
than any man or woman time magazine said in naming it story of the 
year 
this year the earth spoke like god warning noah of the 
deluge the weekly newsmagazine said in departing from its annual 
man of the year designation 
no single individual no event no movement captured 
imaginations or dominated headlines more than the clump of rock and 
soil and water and air that is our common home it said citing 
natural and humancaused disasters like earthquakes drought 
overpopulation pollution of the worlds beaches 
every year since 1927 times editors have selected a person 
group or object they believe most significantly influenced world 
events that year an inanimate object was chosen once before the 
computer in 1982 
in the cover article of its jan 2 issue released saturday time 
warned of a series of impending environmental catastrophes 
pollutioncaused warming of the atmosphere known as the 
greenhouse effect threatening weather changes that could flood 
coastlines and render large areas of the planet infertile and 
uninhabitable 
toxic and radioactive wastes and dumped garbage that could 
poison drinking water and despoil the land 
chemical pollution that is depleting the atmospheres protective 
ozone layer 
clearing of tropical rain forests driving thousands of species 
to extinction 
most of these evils had been going on for a long time and some 
of the worst disasters apparently had nothing to do with human 
behavior time said yet this years bout of freakish weather 
and environmental horror stories seemed to act as a powerful 
catalyst for worldwide public opinion 
added time now more than ever the world needs leaders who 
can inspire their fellow citizens with a fiery sense of mission not 
a nationalistic or military campaign but a universal crusade to save 
the planet

it wasnt until more than half a century later 
that a retired aerospace worker learned she was the hatbox baby 
a newborn found in a hatbox in the arizona desert on christmas eve 
1931 
everybody in my family knew the story except me said sharon 
elliott who at age 57 still has the same red hair and blue eyes 
that won so many hearts in 1931 when the story hit the newspapers 
my mother didnt want me to find out it was such a shock after 
all these years i couldnt believe that during all that time it 
had been kept from me she said in an interview published sunday 
in the mesa tribune 
the tale of the baby began when edward and julie stewart were 
making their way toward phoenix a puncture forced them to stop 
along the dusty highway about 10 miles west of superior 
as stewart repaired the tire his wife heard a cry and then 
beckoned her husband to venture with her into the desert stillness 
a hundred yards from the road they found a black pasteboard 
hatbox with the lid fastened stewart kicked it eliciting another 
cry 
the stewarts opened the box and inside they found an infant 
about a week old wrapped in flowered pajamas 
newspapers rejoiced in the incredible good fortune that led the 
stewarts to the hatbox baby and they cooed over the redhaired 
blueeyed waif who was eventually put up for adoption 
ms elliott a retired aerospace worker who moved from california 
to mesa several months ago learned she was the hatbox baby about 
two years ago shortly before her adoptive mother passed away 
my daughter and soninlaw were being transferred to mesa and 
my mother was afraid that somehow i would find out that somebody 
would say something and i would get hurt it was a big story in 
those days and for years the papers wrote about it every christmas 
wondering whatever happened to that little baby 
when she told me i cried she was the only mother i ever knew 
the only one i ever wanted but now that shes gone id like to 
find out more 
arizona newspapers followed the babys story closely until she 
was adopted in february 1932 years later newspapers and national 
sunday magazines repeatedly asked whatever became of the baby 
she now is 30 years old and quietly beautiful they say a 
woman of exceptional grace and purity living somewhere in arizona 
columnist don dedera wrote in the arizona republic on christmas 
day 1961 
dedera wrote many more columns and stories about the baby hoping 
someday she might read one and come forward 
its such an intriguing little mystery a wonderful story 
dedera now a freelance writer said in a recent interview i always 
had hoped id be able to wrap it up 
ms elliott eventually went to the mesa tribune and identified 
herself as the hatbox baby to see if reporters had any information 
about who left her in the desert and why but nothing about her 
origin has surfaced

earlier this year wyoming indignantly 
became the last state in the nation to raise its legal drinking age 
to 21 next month the legislature will be asked to display its rage 
by lowering it back to 19 
the request comes barely six months after the higher age limit 
took effect and is seen by its sponsors as a way to defend the us 
constitution and to rise up against federal blackmail 
it also comes in the wake of a study showing that the 
singlevehicle nighttime crash fatality rate among drivers ages 19 
and 20 declined 38 percent in tennessee in the 28 months after that 
state raised its drinking age from 19 to 21 
wyoming raised its drinking age when faced with a federal mandate 
that threatened loss of millions of dollars in highway funds 
state reps hl jensen and dan budd are sponsors of legislation 
to repeal the 21yearold limit 
i think we disfranchised a segment of the population of the 
state and i dont think its done that much good in cutting down the 
traffic fatalities said jensen 
added budd i feel the federal government violated the trust of 
the us constitution and i think its worth pursuing 
budd in 1987 killed an attempt to raise the drinking age by 
pocketing the proposed legislation when it reached the house 
transportation committee which he chairs 
certainly they can withhold the money budd said they 
blackmailed the state of wyoming but i guess if you sell out if 
thats the only thing youre looking at then the constitution has 
no meaning we dont need a constitution well base everything on 
money 
state highway department officials say it could cost wyoming 
123 million in federal funding in fiscal 1990 if the legislature 
lowers the age limit 
in a study published in fridays journal of the american medical 
association dr michael decker of vanderbilt university school of 
medicine said raising the drinking age to 21 had a dramatic 
immediate and lasting effect on the number of fatalities of 19 and 
20yearolds 
tom fanter of the wyoming highway departments safety branch said 
that in 1987 the state had 53 alcoholrelated accidents involving 
fatalities of those 11 or nearly 21 percent involved motorists 
under age 21 who had been drinking eight of those 11 accidents 
involved 19 and 20yearolds he said 
in the first 10 months of 1988 there were 48 fatal accidents 
involving alcohol and 13 of those or 27 percent involved motorists 
under age 21 said fanter of the 13 nine occurred after the higher 
drinking age took effect july 1 and seven involved 19and 
20yearolds 
this shows me we still need enforcement he said 
jensen said the vanderbilt study was like comparing apples to 
oranges thats interesting for tennessee but i dont think it has 
any bearing on wyoming he said adding that factors such as law 
enforcement affect fatality rates 
in wyoming increasing the age limit didnt accomplish the 
purpose of keeping the alcohol from 19 and 20 years old if thats 
what they wanted to do said jensen 
gov mike sullivan initially opposed increasing the drinking age 
but is disappointed by the attempt to lower the limit 
thats one of the silliest ideas ive heard in a long time 
sullivan said it doesnt seem to me to be particularly 
constructive we went through a large battle to get where we are 
i said last year i didnt think we should be an island in the 
us on that and my mind hasnt changed any

presidentelect bushs choice to lead the 
defense department says an emphasis on weapons systems that depend 
on fewer people may help the pentagon meet its needs in a time of 
budgetary constraint 
the big cost is not in the b2 bomber the b1 and the 
aircraft carriers former texas sen john tower said sunday the 
big cost is not in the hardware the big cost is in personnel 
tower bushs designated defense secretary said one of his first 
priorities would be devising a strategy to achieve national 
objectives for defense 
then we have to look at the roles and missions of all our 
forces and see where they fit into that strategy he said on the 
cbstv program face the nation 
programs that dont fit tower said get low priority and they 
get cut and hopefully by going to less manpowerintensive systems 
we can make some economies 
tower was long rumored as bushs choice for defense secretary but 
the announcement was delayed for several weeks as the fbi conducted 
an exhaustive background check of the former senator known for his 
prodefense positions while in the congress 
i discovered much to my dismay that not everybody loves me 
tower said when asked about the lengthy review fueled in part by 
accusations made by his exwife 
of reports that he sometimes drank to excess tower said he only 
drank in moderation im only a wine drinker he said i dont 
drink spirits

san francisco and las vegas enjoyed a rare white christmas while 
new york and boston were left dry as millions of americans 
celebrated a holiday of joy and homecoming tinged with the 
remembrance of tragedy near and far 
for many the day after christmas meant relaxing amid shucked 
gift wrappings and turkey leftovers but for the less fortunate 
today was a return to the streets or lonely prison life after an 
interlude of charity from fellow americans 
the giving spirit is definitely at a high said philip 
bascom a worker at the greater bangor area shelter for the homeless 
in maine i think people are more sympathetic on christmas 
and a great deal of sympathy was needed this year many 
volunteers said 
there are just so many more homeless people worker joe 
ferguson said at the atlantic city nj rescue mission where 
about 250 people gathered sunday for ham and turkey its been a 
bad year 
weve never had this many people said ken kruger who runs 
the volunteers of america residence in new york city last year 
we finished serving at 2 pm 
toward evening a line of homeless people was still threedeep 
around the block 
at new yorks st patricks cathedral cardinal john oconnor led 
prayers in remembrance of the 258 people aboard pan am flight 103 
who were killed when the jet crashed wednesday in scotland 
oconnor said the faith of the families of plane crash victims 
was heartening 
thinking that i would console or encourage them he said i 
found my own faith deepened instead by their acceptance of 
suffering their willingness to let whatever happens in this world 
happen and to know that god still loves them very deeply 
not all churches were bedecked with boughs of holly or other 
tokens of christmas green and red in snowless massachusetts 
wreaths in armenian churches were wrapped in black in memory of the 
55000 people believed killed by a dec 7 earthquake in soviet 
armenia 
doctors and nurses from portland ore who rushed to armenia 
following the quake returned home christmas eve saying they found 
the real meaning of christmas in the hearts of the victims 
the armenians despite the death and destruction within their 
lives were magnificent and totally devoted to us and other 
foreigners who came to help them said northwest medical teams 
founder ron post 
in hayward calif santa claus suffered a setback when thieves 
stole more than 2000 worth of christmas toys bought by 
firefighters for needy children but people who heard of the theft 
brought bikes soccer balls puzzles games and other toys to the 
firehouse 
we have received probably three or four times the toys that we 
started with said capt bruce jones we just cant even express 
our gratitude to the people that came in 
a more permanent loss struck a family in northern indiana when 
six family members and a fiancee were killed in a traffic accident 
en route to a christmas eve celebration 
it was a shocker said linda fort the sisterinlaw of laura 
cites one of the victims it just couldnt be worse people are 
giving this time of year but this really puts a damper on 
everything its still the lords birthday and she is with the 
lord that gives us a lot of comfort 
a setback also was suffered by members of the 70yearold united 
methodist church in ware shoals sc which was destroyed by fire 
sunday hours after christmas day services concluded in the landmark 
building 
the fire was believed to have originated in the electrical system 
christmas day in georgia meant a feast for 30000 needy people in 
atlanta and peace and quiet after a christmas eve riot at the hall 
county jail 
they were disgruntled said sheriffs sgt ed barfield 
its overcrowded here weve got them one on top of another its 
christmas 
while the east coast was dry frosty yuletide temperatures led to 
christmas day snow flurries that dusted las vegas san francisco and 
lowlying southern california foothills drifts made higher mountain 
regions impassable 
snow closed interstate 5 for several hours sunday night at tejon

pope john paul ii made his most extensive 
comment yet about aids in his annual holiday message saying his 
christmas wish is that science and love will find a cure for the 
deadly disease 
the whiterobed pontiff speaking from the balcony over the main 
entrance to st peters basilica appealed for help for aids 
sufferers and for help for survivors of the devastating earthquake 
in soviet armenia 
let forces be joined and efforts be increased to help those in 
need with whom christ himself wished to identify himself said 
the leader of the worlds 850 million roman catholics 
the pope wearing a glittering gold miter and carrying a staff 
topped by a cross said sunday that the beauty of christmas lies in 
the fact god sent his son as a poor person 
the poor under every label old and new have a place in the 
mystery of christmas those suffering and dying of hunger the 
rejected the disinherited refugees the victims of hatred of 
wars of natural disasters he said in italian 
john paul ii devoted several minutes of his address to those 
suffering from illnesses including aquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
i think of them all and to all of them i say do not lose 
hope the polishborn pope said these words are addressed above 
all to the victims of aids called to face the challenge not only of 
the sickness but also the mistrust of a fearful society that 
instinctively turns away from them 
i invite everyone to take up the tragic burden of these 
brethren of ours and as i assure them of my deep affection i 
exhort scientists and researchers to increase their efforts to find 
an effective treatment for this mysterious illness he said 
may the concerted efforts of science and love soon find the 
hopedfor remedy this is the hope that i lay at the crib of the 
newborn savior 
about 70000 people who packed st peters square under sunny 
skies listened quietly to the traditional message different groups 
burst into applause when the pope in his conclusion offered 
christmas greetings in 44 languages 
the address was broadcast directly to 15 countries including the 
soviet union for the first time it was shown on television later or 
in partial form in 35 other nations 
the speech marked one of the few occasions on which the 
68yearold pontiff has discussed aids he first publicly addressed 
the issue during a 1987 visit to san francisco in which he told aids 
sufferers that god loves you all without distinction 
he also expressed sympathy for aids victims earlier this month 
saying the church must consider them brothers and sisters 
in a major statement on aids earlier this year the vatican 
newspaper losservatore romano said that the spread of the disease 
must be arrested and people must overcome ethically aberrant 
behaviors 
it said that sexual permissiveness was the true cause of the 
problem 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread 
most often through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by 
drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from pregnant 
women to their offspring 
the vatican condemns homosexuality and the use of artificial 
birth control it has criticized campaigns advocating condoms to 
stop the spread of aids 
the pontiff gave sundays address after saying mass in st 
peters for about 8000 people ranging from diplomats to the holy 
see in black morning coats to tourists in blue jeans 
earlier he celebrated midnight mass before thousands of people 
in the basilica

washington dc 
the cause of the derailment is not known at this time but all 
cars are reported to be upright and in line we have no reports of 
injuries to passengers jacobsen said 
at this point it doesnt seem to be a serious derailment in

to glenwood springs where they would be put up in hotels for the 
night

monday while share prices advanced on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 12472 yen down 023 yen from fridays 
close of 12495 yen after opening at 12485 yen the currency

the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which gained 
010 points during its halfday session saturday added another 
18165 points or 061 percent closing at 2986801 
trading was thin but market players showed interest in 
highpriced issues such as finances which can influence the index 
even if the number of shares changing hands is small said a dealer 
with daiwa securities 
the majority of dealers were sitting on the sidelines because 
they feel safer getting rid of shares before the yearend and new 
year holidays and because of uncertainties including the emperors 
condition he said 
markets will close when emperor hirohito dies christmas day 
marked his 63rd year on the chrysanthemum throne but the 
87yearold monarch has been in serious condition with internal 
hemorrhaging for more than three months 
traders are also reluctant to make major moves in a shortened 
trading week because of the new years holiday the stock market 
will be open for two fullday sessions and one halfday session this 
week 
trading on the currency exchange was slow reflecting the 
christmas holiday lull on overseas markets 
market players could not decide on trading tactics today 
without knowing trends on overseas markets said a dealer at

the following are excerpts from the vaticans 
official english translation of pope john paul iis annual christmas 
message delivered on sunday from the balcony of st peters 
basilica 
how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings 
good tidings is 527 
how beautiful is christmas yet it is filled with human 
misery it bears the mark of a closed door when joseph and mary 
sought refuge in the inn it bears the mark of peoples indifference 
to others the first sign of the hardened hearts which the 
messenger of good tidings will confront not only in the days of his 
earthly life but in every generation and precisely because of 
all this christmas is beautiful 
eyes enlightened by faith discover the attraction of the 
mystery of god under the veil of poverty and neglect 
the church prolongs the mystery of the incarnation of the word 
and proclaims the news of salvation to the farthest ends of the 
earth today as yesterday she carries forward the first and second 
evangelization to fulfill the expectations that man bears in 
himself today i greet this missionary church i greet and encourage 
the priests the men and women religious the catechists doctors 
nurses teachers technicians 
the poor under every label old and new have a place in the 
mystery of christmas those suffering and dying of hunger the 
rejected the disinherited refugees the victims of hatred of 
wars of natural disasters in a special way i am thinking of those 
who have been affected by the terrible earthquake in armenia and 
are now mourning their loved ones buried under the debris keeping 
anxious watch at the bedside of the injured in the hospitals or 
struggling against the cold and the bad weather without a roof 
under which to seek shelter for themselves and their children in 
this tragic hour may they experience the understanding and support 
of people of good will may the world see an increase of the 
generous reaction which has mobilized governments organizations and 
individuals in a wonderful chain of solidarity and with everyones 
help may the work of reconstruction begin so that hope may spring 
again in that sorely afflicted region 
my thoughts also go to those who are lacking in that precious 
gift that is good health to all those who are affected by illness 
and struggle with it in hospital wards clinics or their own homes 
i think of them all and to all of them i say do not lose hope 
these words are addressed above all to the victims of aids called 
to face the challenge not only of the sickness but also the mistrust 
of a fearful society that instinctively turns away from them i 
invite everyone to take up the tragic burden of these brethren of 
ours and as i assure them of my deep affection i exhort

the plo maintains a discreet presence in 
tunisia where yasser arafat has made his headquarters a head 
without a body it is 1500 miles from the land arafat seeks for an 
independent palestinian state 
there are no office complexes residential compounds or guerrilla 
training camps no obvious signs of the palestine liberation 
organization 
as one western diplomat put it theres no swagger about it 
in fact the organizations offices are not easy to find 
the plos presence consists of several political offices in 
inconspicuous houses scattered around the city a few dozen 
officials and a total palestinian population of about 1000 
arafat is often away seeking international support for a 
palestinian state in israelioccupied land with a peace initiative 
that this month succeeded in engaging the united states in dialogue 
compared to the 3 million palestinians living in jordan and the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip the plo presence in tunis is 
miniscule 
tunis is not home really said khaled bahig who works in the 
plos information department its very far from our people its 
not like lebanon jordan or syria here we are just working in our 
offices we are not really working among the palestinian people but 
from the political point of view we have a lot to do 
the plo moved its headquarters to tunis in august 1982 after 
being driven out of beirut by the israeli invasion of lebanon 
tunisias president at the time habib bourgiba had always been a 
staunch supporter of the palestinian movement 
the more than 1000 plo fighters who came here from lebanon were 
temporarily stationed at a camp in the hills west of tunis the camp 
was closed in 1985 and the fighters moved on to iraq algeria 
sudan north and south yemen and lebanon the plo says it no longer 
maintains a military presence here 
part of the reason for the plo low profile in tunis is the threat 
from its enemies 
in october 1985 israeli jets streaked across the mediterranean 
and bombed arafats residence administrative office and the homes 
of several plo officials in the seaside suburb of hamam plage 
killing at least 61 palestinians and 12 tunisians 
the plo still maintains a small administrative office in a 
rundown building at the site located on a gravel road marked by a 
blue sign avenue of the martyrs of oct 1 1985 
in april plo military commander khalil wazir also known as abu 
jihad was assassinated in his home near carthage the plo blamed 
israels mossad secret service and israeli officials privately 
acknowledged responsibility 
today the house is shuttered two posters of wazir are pasted on 
the front door and a palestinian flag is taped to a window on the 
second floor 
tunis is more of a rest stop than a permanent base for the plo 
top brass 
arafat is constantly on the move when he does stop in tunis it 
is usually for a short time and his whereabouts are secret it is 
said that he never sleeps in the same bed twice for fear of 
assassination by israeli agents or radical palestinians opponents 
still tunis serves as a type of proxy plo capital and it is 
where the united states has through ambassador robert h pelletreau 
jr begun talking with the organization the first talks on dec 16 
ended a 13year ban on official us contact with the plo 
the move came after arafat met us criteria for talks by 
renouncing terrorism and recognizing israels right to exist 
the usplo talks were arranged through the plos political 
department the headquarters of farouk kaddoumi often referred to 
as its foreign minister 
the department is located in a white twostory house in a new 
neighborhood on the citys outskirts a visitor wouldnt notice it 
but for the presence of two tunisian security guards with machine 
guns or the mercedes of a visiting ambassador parked in front 
inside the walls are lined with posters hailing palestinians 
yearlong uprising in the west bank and gaza 
a few hundred yards away on an unpaved deadend side street that 
tunisian taxi drivers often have difficulty finding is the plos 
information department a simple house that serves as the office of 
plo spokesman ahmed rahman 
the plo in tunis also maintains departments of social affairs and 
education the news agency wafa and a school for 400 palestinian 
children 
most of the palestinians live together said ribhi awad an 
assistant to kaddoumi you can find 10 families in one building 
but they also mix in tunisian life the tunisian people have been 
very sympathetic to our cause

the national spotlight but all that could change because a 
10000acre spread in gods country is a favorite hunting spot 
of presidentelect bush 
the presidentelect today was to begin a fourday visit to will 
farishs lazy f ranch for the past 20 christmas seasons bush has 
retreated there to tote a shotgun through the south texas mesquite 
in search of quail and other game birds 
nobody paid much attention until the vice president became the 
presidentelect and some in this town of 15000 are applauding the 
change 
it would bring a lot of tourists to town said janice porter 
manager of the beeville chamber of commerce it would do a lot for 
beeville 
he hunts in a rough place really but he calls it gods 
country said city manager jose montez im sure that if he 
keeps coming here we will receive some national exposure 
beeville 65 miles northwest of corpus christi last saw a 
president when william howard taft stopped by to make a whistlestop 
speech in the early 1900s 
bush aides said the vice president would arrive and depart on air 
force two at the nearby chase field naval air station bee countys

it was founded in 1835 by irish settlers and named after bernard 
e bee who served in the government of the republic of texas which 
lasted from 1836 until texas joined the union in 1845 
recently beevilles economy has suffered from the drop in oil 
prices and lean years for farmers and ranchers as with many other 
small cities big discount department stores on the outskirts of 
town have put a squeeze on the downtown business district where the 
city has begun a 450000 revitalization project 
susan stasny who in 1986 was elected bee countys first 
republican county commissioner met bush during one of his hunting 
trips she said having a president visit occasionally would boost 
the status of the city and county

more than a dozen people were injured in an 
allnight clash that started at a school dance between chinese and 
african students in nanking the official xinhua news agency said 
today 
thousands of chinese surrounded two buildings at one university 
where african students live and pelted students with rocks and 
bottles for seven hours said an african student contacted by 
telephone from beijing 
the chinese then marched to other universities and bombarded 
other dormitories which house african students 
the xinhua report said two africans and 11 chinese employees from 
hehai university in the eastern chinese city were injured 
the incident was the latest in a series of violent outbreaks 
between black african students and chinese during the last several 
years chinese authorities say they are isolated cases and deny 
charges by the africans that they are a result of racism against 
africans in chinese society 
xinhua said the problem started when two african students 
escorting chinese women to a school dance refused a request by 
university authorities to register the womens names the common 
practice is designed to limit contact between chinese and foreigners 
the report said other african students forced open the door and 
attacked university employees teachers and students with iron 
sticks bottles and rocks 
the african student who was at the party said he first learned 
of a problem when rocks and bottles began flying into the dance hall 
i looked outside and i saw a crowd of about 2000 chinese he 
said 
he said the crowd threw rocks and bottles at the dance hall and 
two student dormitories from about 10 pm saturday until 5 am 
sunday 
the crowd trapped us inside the buildings and we couldnt get 
out said the student 
another band of chinese returned to hehai at noon sunday and 
continued throwing rocks and bottles at the building he said 
that crowd which he estimated at about 4000 then marched to 
two other universities in nanking where black africans study he 
quoted african students there as saying the crowd also threw rocks 
and bottles at african dormitories 
in its report xinhua said an unspecified number of students held 
a street march shouting punish assailants 
the african student who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
police escorted about 70 african students to nanjings main train 
station sunday he and xinhua said the students demanded that they 
be sent to beijing 
today a dutch student at nanking university said about 200 black 
africans from three different universities were at the station and 
all wanted to go to beijing an official at the train station twice 
refused to let a reporter talk by telephone to the students 
xinhua said local police have taken measures to protect the 
african students and said some africans have returned to the 
university 
in may 1986 about 18 africans studying in the northeastern city 
of tianjin fled to beijing because of reported threats from chinese 
following a bottlethrowing battle that started after chinese 
students complained of noise from a foreigners party 
about 200 african students in beijing then staged a march to 
protest what they said was racism against the estimated 1500 
africans studying on chinese campuses 
in 1980 19 africans and arabs and 24 chinese were injured in a 
fight in shanghai that also began over loud music from a foreigners 
radio

snowy night in subzero temperatures on the 9425foot rabbit ears 
pass by crosscountry skiing all night 
mitchell dion 32 and his wife sydney 25 of san pedro 
calif were found in good condition saturday nearly 24 hours after 
leaving on what was supposed to be a threehour crosscountry ski 
trip authorities said

observation and released 
dion said he suffered frostbite on a toe but mrs dion was 
unharmed

search taylor said the helicopter crew spotted the couple on 
rabbit ears pass 
dion said he and his wife left on the ski trip shortly before 
noon friday carrying two baked potatoes and a quart of water 
we just wanted to get warmed up but then i got us completely 
lost he said i didnt think that kind of thing could happen to 
me we got so far away from where we intended to be that even the 
searchers couldnt find us 
once we realized that we just had to survive our fatigue went 
away and we never got tired or hungry after that he said 
the couple braved a snowstorm for several hours but the snowfall 
stopped about 3 am saturday they figured out where they were with 
the help of the moonlight dion said 
he recognized a canyon that would lead them out but the route 
was a difficult one dion said 
it was very steep and with rocks and brambles we didnt know 
how hard it was going to be he said we were heading toward the 
main highway when the helicopter found us

killings during christmas weekend pushed the 
citys 1988 homicide total to a grisly record of 1848 a trend that 
authorities said has been fueled by crack and other drugs 
with a week to go before years end seven homicides on saturday 
raised the total for 1988 to 1842 one more than the record set in 
1981 said a police spokesman sgt raymond odonnell 
christmas day brought six more homicides said another police 
spokesman sgt maurice howard 
on an average day in new york city five people are slain 
elected and police officials blame drugs particularly crack for 
the rise in violence 
in all of 1945 the police department reported 291 homicides in 
august 1988 alone there were 201 since the crack explosion in 
1985 homicides have steadily increased 1385 in 1985 1582 in 
1986 and 1672 last year 
as of last month assistant police chief raymond kelly said 
about 42 percent of this years slayings were drugrelated 
these tragic statistics reflect the mayors concern expressed 
over the past 4 years that the federal government ought to do 
something about drugs flooding across our border said mayoral 
spokesman lee jones 
the problem is not limited to new york washington also has set a 
record for the most homicides in a year 
new york ranks 10th in killings per 100000 people said kelly 
the top three are detroit washington and new orleans he said 
the recordsetting homicide reported shortly after 11 pm 
saturday involved a 19yearold staten island man whose body was 
found on a streetcorner riddled with bullet wounds according to a 
police spokeswoman sgt diane kubler the motive for the slaying 
was unknown she said

calling it the greatest christmas gift 
that i could give presidentelect bushs son john passed out 
candy and toys to children injured in armenias devastating 
earthquake 
john e bush and his 12yearold son george flew into the 
armenian capital of yerevan aboard a dc8 cargo plane carrying 
relief supplies toured the disaster zone in a bus and stopped in 
the village of spitak which was flattened by the dec 7 quake 
they returned to yerevan later sunday and visited rooms on three 
floors of childrens hospital no 3 where more than 600 youngsters 
hurt in the quake have been treated 
bush and his son handed out candy bars teddy bears games of 
ticktacktoe and other donated toys flown in by the americares 
charity 
this is probably the greatest christmas gift that i could give 
myself or my son said the lanky 35yearold miami real estate 
developer who is nicknamed jeb 
armenians themselves were not celebrating christmas an ancient 
people who embraced christianty as a state religion more than 1600 
years ago armenians have canceled christmas festivities on jan 6 
the date they and the other eastern rites usually celebrate the 
birth of jesus 
bushs eyes welled with tears as whitecoated armenian doctors 
and nurses speaking through interpreters told him of the ordeals 
and injuries of the children many of whom gazed blankly and 
silently at the visitors from their hospital beds 
paulik khaladvhan 12 was crushed as his spitak home collapsed 
and lay unconscious for seven days under the ruins mona kasparyan 
3 was pinned motionless under a broken concrete panel for four 
days 
kayani petrosyan 5 was buried alive with her mother for nine 
days and survived only because the woman cut her fingers and fed her 
blood 
happy christmas to you youre a brave little girl bush told 
kayani who was cradled in her grandmothers arms 
oganis tomasyan bent over to kiss the 12yearold bush when the 
boy gave candy and toys to tomasyans granddaughter mona the 
girls mother died saturday in a moscow hospital after her legs were 
amputated 
i saw children who suffered and i looked at the horrible scenes 
of the buildings george said of his trip to the disaster area 
he said his christmas visit to armenia is better than just 
sitting at home and opening presents 
alarmed that the bushes might pass them by injured children in 
fifthfloor wards and their parents descended stairs and 
pathetically pleaded with hospital staff and soviet officials to 
have the presidentelects son visit them too 
they wont let him come because our floor hasnt been repaired 
for his visit said a sobbing artyun grigoryan 12 as he stood on 
crutches in the stairwell an ugly gash visible on his head tell 
him please tell him that on the fifth floor there are suffering 
children too 
the hospitals chief doctor ophelia nazaryan said bush was not 
invited to other wards because of the risk of infection marguerite 
squire a us embassy spokeswoman from moscow accompanying bush 
said bush had brought enough toys for all 350 children now at the 
hospital and that they would be distributed 
bush said there was nothing political about his oneday visit 
this is no question of politics or ideology he said its 
a question of people helping people an estimated 55000 people 
were killed in the quake and a half million rendered homeless 
bush and his son were to fly home via new york later sunday but 
their plane was grounded by heavy snow in yerevan according to 
susan hanson a spokeswoman for americares a private relief 
organization based in new canaan conn 
in the disaster area workers continued to clear rubble and 
evacuate residents the labor newspaper trud said sunday that 99000 
people had been taken out of the area more than 60000 of them to 
places outside the armenian republic

squawking waterfowl coated with some of the 70000 gallons of oil 
that spilled into the ocean after a tug boat collided with a barge 
with the search for dead and ailing birds continuing 207 dead 
birds had been found by sunday night and it could take weeks for 
officials to determine how many of the injured waterfowl will 
survive said pam miller a state biologist in charge of the rescue 
mission 
sause bros ocean towing of coos bay ore owner of the tug 
ocean services and barge nestucca hired a company to begin cleanup 
operations saturday dick lauer a company manager said sunday he 
doubted an estimate of cleanup costs would be available before late 
today 
officials said 570 rescued birds were kept in cardboard boxes 
around the hoquiam middle school gymnasium locker rooms and 
hallways about 50 volunteers worked on bird cleanup sunday at the 
makeshift bird hospital noisy with squawking birds tapping on their 
boxes 
it took about an hour for each bird to be cleaned by a pair of 
volunteers and then wrapped in towels or cloths to be kept warm 
the birds mostly openocean birds such as murres were being 
tubefed twice a day with smelt most arrived pretty well coated 
with oil from head to toe ms miller said 
it would probably take three or four weeks to clean inspect and 
return the stricken birds to the wild said alice berkner executive 
director of the bird rescue research center in berkeley calif and 
supervisor of the rescue of those treated 25 percent to 65 percent 
are expected to survive officials said 
oil ruins the insulating effect of a birds feathers which can 
cause it to die of cold ms miller said birds also can be poisoned 
by ingesting oil while cleaning their feathers she added 
the birds including grebes loons scoters and other sea ducks 
were found along a 30 to 40mile section of coastline after the 
tugboat ocean services struck the fueloil barge nestucca it was 
towing to grays harbor on thursday authorities said 
an emergency patch was placed on the barge saturday and the next 
day it was taken to portland ore for repairs 
athough oilsoaked birds were found from the mouth of the 
columbia river to moclips oil washed ashore only along a threemile 
stretch of beach from the entrance to grays harbor northward to 
ocean shores officials said a wildlife department spokesman said 
beach cleanup was progressing smoothly 
two remaining strips of oil were five to 15 miles offshore late 
sunday but officials expect it to dissipate or sink said wildlife 
department spokesman doug zimmer 
he added that damage was minimized because the spill occurred at 
high tide so the most of oil was drawn out to sea and dissipated 
rather than being concentrated in more environmentally sensitive 
shoreline areas 
the biggest known spill in washington state waters was a 
239000gallon leak from the tanker arco anchorage in port angeles 
on dec 21 1985 with bird losses conservatively estimated at 1600 
marine fowl and 475 ducks

a baptist minister from new jersey who 
came under contra rebel fire this year has defied us government 
policy and brought about 70 tons of food medicine and supplies to 
the nicaraguan people for christmas 
the rev lucius walker arrived in nicaragua on christmas eve with 
a caravan of 18 vehicles carrying the goods for the victims of the 
sevenyear civil war 
this feels like a great sense of triumph because the terrorism 
here is supported by the government of the united states and we 
are representatives of the goodwill of the people of the united 
states the baptist minister said 
walker of demarest nj is the executive director of the new 
yorkbased interreligious foundation for community organization 
which sponsored the relief effort called pastors for peace 
the reagan administration in 1985 ordered an economic boycott of 
leftist nicaragua but the ban excludes humanitarian aid 
in july another convoy of aid crossed the usmexico border 
after a long dispute with us customs service which said taking 
the trucks to nicaragua would violate the 1985 measure 
the government agrees the roughly 70 tons of supplies qualify as 
humanitarian aid exempt from the embargo but says the vehicles are 
not aid 
walkers vehicles which crossed the us border on dec 14 were 
detained briefly by customs officials according to tom hansen a 
project coordinator from new york 
we were forced to call our lawyers and say the licensing 
request they wanted was illegal he said humanitarian aid 
doesnt require an export license 
walkers organization is strongly opposed to the contra rebels 
who with us backing have fought since 1981 to try to oust the 
sandinistas 
when walker visited nicaragua in august he said he was slightly 
wounded by a contra bullet fired during an attack on a riverboat in 
eastern nicaragua but he vowed to return with aid 
i feel a great sense of satisfaction and rightness walker 
said 
the goods will be distributed among nicaraguans by religious 
groups said sharon haas another project coordinator from cleveland 
ms haas said she doesnt see much hope for a change in us 
policies toward the nicaraguan government after the january 
inauguaration of george bush as president 
ms haas said the group planned to travel to the nicaraguan 
coastal city of bluefields to see the devastation left by the oct 
22 hurricane 
walker said he was wounded while traveling from bluefields but 
rebel activity there has dropped substantially after a ceasefire 
agreement was signed by the government and the contras in march 
talks aimed at establishing a permanent peace broke down in 
september 
most contras have fled to camps in honduras where they received 
ussupplied aid ranging from food to uniforms 
congress stopped us military aid to the rebels in february but 
allowed distribution of nonlethal aid to continue in neighboring 
honduras

the plo will insist that an 
independent palestine have a corridor through israel to connect the 
gaza strip and the west bank plo chief yasser arafat is quoted by a 
west germany magazine as saying 
in an interview in this weeks der spiegel magazine arafat also 
was quoted as saying the palestine liberation organization will 
continue to demand that jerusalem be capital of that independent 
state 
he was asked if in the negotiations he hopes for with israel he 
would insist on sticking to un resolution 181 which deliniates 
borders for israel and a palestinian state under those borders 
some areas that the israelis have held for 40 years would be part of 
a palestinian state 
however arafat was quoted as saying lets get the talks 
started first then each can put their conditions on the table 
but in all cases we will insist on establishing a corridor 
between west bank of the river jordan and the gaza strip it is 
not acceptable for us to establish a state split into two parts 
the palestine national council declared an independent state nov 
15 at a meeting in algiers then after arafat explicitly recognized 
israels right to exist and renounced terrorism washington ended a 
13year ban on contacts with the organization and opened talks with 
the plo on dec 16 
israel has said it will not negotiate for middle east peace with 
the plo which it considers a terrorist organization 
arafat backs an international middle east peace conference and 
has in the past two weeks traveled to austria east germany italy 
romania and yugoslavia seeking support for the plan he had an 
audience with pope john paul ii on friday 
der spiegel also quoted the plo leader as saying he is willing to 
negotiate on equal terms 
in the interview arafat also insisted that arab east jerusalem 
must be the palestine capital we demand our arabian jerusalem 
not more and not less israel annexed arab east jerusalem after 
seizing it in the 1967 middle east war along with the west bank and 
gaza strip which are home to 17 million palestinians 
palestinians in the occupied lands are engaged in a yearlong 
uprising against israeli occupation that has claimed the lives of at 
least 335 arabs and 14 israelis plo officials have credited the 
revolt for helping gain international sympathy for their cause

it was the worst and best of christmases for 
jack wittman who thought he had lost his son in the pan am crash 
over scotland and then suddenly received the gift of his boys 
life 
i had the greatest present i could have had i had my christmas 
last night jack wittman the father of master sgt david lee 
oconnor said sunday i am 62 years old and will never live to 
have a better christmas than the one last night

heart goes out to them because i know what they are feeling

being told by pan am that the soldier stationed in west germany

of upset and didnt know what was going on he said i am alive and 
doing well when we both quit crying and settled down i told him i 
loved him and wished he was here thank god he wasnt on the plane 
the false information apparently came from a listing of d 
oconnor wittman said but the actual victim was daniel e 
oconnor 31 of boston who was a security agent for the state 
department in nicosia cyprus 
wittman who is retired from a sapulpa glass company said the 
mistaken notification of his sons death sent shock waves through 
his family as it gathered to celebrate christmas his son had sent

a controversial denver program that pays teenage 
girls 1 a day not to get pregnant is proving one of the most 
successful methods of curbing the teen pregnancy rate supporters 
say 
the program was introduced at la mariposa health station three 
years ago and prompted criticism even from many supporters of 
family planning who saw it as paternal and coercive 
supporters of the program dont claim to have found the ultimate 
solution to the teenage pregnancy problem but they say on a small 
scale it works and costs less in the long run 
between 30 percent and 50 percent of teenagers who become 
pregnant once are likely to become pregnant again before theyre 18 
but of 18 original participants in the denver program only 17 
percent had a repeat pregnancy 
gov roy romers initiative on teen pregnancy reported that 
colorado spends more than 200 million annually in aid to families 
with dependent children food stamps medicaid and other public 
assistance for families headed by women who began their childbearing 
as teens 
to earn their money all the teenagers have to do is show up 
once a week at the west side clinic for a group session la mariposa 
counselor diane medina presides over a stack of dollar bills and a 
smorgasbord of snacks she just listens to the conversation and 
makes no demands 
about a dozen teenagers are regulars others come occasionally 
or drop by to pick up their 7 and leave 
there are no hard and fast rules said medical director dr 
peggy latourrette they can talk about anything they want to this 
is the only group the one place they can come in and nobodys 
telling them what to do nobodys giving them rules and 
regulations 
officials at rocky mountain planned parenthood have had their 
hands slapped by their national headquarters for funding the 
program but they hope to prop it up for another year the program 
lacks funding for 1989 
supporters say anyone with 1 a day to contribute to the project 
can sponsor a teenager significantly decreasing the odds that 
she will give birth to a child before shes 18 
desiree ramos 16 has earned 462 through the program which for 
her is spending money she had an abortion at 13 and still wants 
children but i want to wait until im 20 maybe 21 
i want to have enough to buy him what he wants i dont want 
him stealing i dont want us living in the projects she said

three huge storage vats were uncorked at a 
winery creating a 450000gallon pink sea and authorities said the 
motive may involve sour grapes 
valves to the storage vats were opened before sunrise saturday at 
bronco wine co located on the outskirts of modesto said 
stanislaus county sheriffs investigators 
over five hours 344000 gallons of white wine and another 
106000 gallons of red wine flowed from the vats at a loss of 
800000 said detective jane irwin 
the culprit may be a disgruntled former or current employee 
because the complex valves on the vats would be difficult for an 
outsider to open she said winery employees were being interviewed 
bronco wine executive john franzia said he was upset about the 
loss but he spent little time crying over spilled wine 
theres nothing i can do about it he said its done 
a winery security guard discovered the spill at 930 am five 
hours earlier everything had been dry franzia said 
workers pumped the wine into an adjacent field and road 
surprising deputies who drove into a 3footdeep pool of the 
liquid wine rose to the patrol car doors ms irwin said 
she said she initially thought the liquid was water dumped by 
recent storms but then noticed that the pool had a bouquet and 
blush

president hosni mubarak said he is willing to 
go to israel if it would help bring peace to the middle east and 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of isreal said he would welcome such a 
visit 
the trip would be the first by an arab leader since anwar sadats 
daring visit in 1977 which set the stage for the first peace treaty 
between israel and an arab state and his two followup visits in 
may and september 1979 
mubarak made the offer in two weekend interviews however he 
told the tokyo newspaper yomiuri on sunday that he would go only if 
israel extends the invitation unconditionally i dont accept any 
preconditions he said 
in responding to mubaraks initial offer made through an 
interview with the kuwait newspaper alanbaa shamir said sunday 
that he would be very happy to receive him in israel 
however shamir indicated on israel television that he wants to 
work with egypt toward providing limited selfrule to palestinians 
in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip based on the 1978 
camp david accords 
in many public statements in recent months mubarak has rejected 
that as a basis for talks 
he supports plo chairman yasser arafat to have elapsed because israel 
failed to honor 
them and because they now have been superseded by other initiatives 
for a palestinian settlement 
if mubarak were to visit israel he would be the first arab 
leader to go to the jewish state since his predecessor sadats 1977 
visit to jerusalem to address the knesset israels parliament set 
in motion the process that made egypt the only arab country linked 
by peace treaty to israel 
moslem extremists assassinated sadat four years later partly 
because of the treaty mubarak then the vice president was 
standing at sadats side but suffered only a minor hand wound 
the latest offer appears part of mubaraks attempt to 
reestablish egypt as the arab worlds main power broker 
mubarak offered to visit israel in replying to a question by the 
kuwaiti newspaper whether he would go if that would resolve the 
whole palestinian issue 
why not go mubarak was quoted as saying if this visit 
would lead to solving the problem and if it would lead to 
establishing a just peace then i am ready 
he said groundwork would have to be laid well 
it is not a matter of empty movements without content or 
established interest if there is something that needs my going 
to israel to resolve the arab cause what should stop me our 
contacts with israel are in the open we discuss and exchange views 
with them and that it is best way to solve issues 
in sundays interview with the japanese newspaper mubarak 
stressed that he has nolations with cairo after the 
peace treaty was signed 
mubarak began shortly after sadats assassination to repair the 
diplomatic damage his moves paid off in november 1987 with a 
decision by the arab league that relations with egypt was a matter 
best left to individual national decisions 
since then all but libya lebanon and syria have restored 
relations and there have been strong hints in recent days of a 
rapprochement with syria

despite the blasts of hot air from exhaust 
grates the comradery of men battling nature regular stops by a 
volunteer soup kitchen and the little donated christmas tree topped 
by a blue baseball cap none of the dozen homeless men at the foggy 
botton triangle thinks life in the streets is quite so great as 
president reagan says they do 
the president said in a television interview before his departure 
for christmas in california that people who live on washingtons 
streets still prefer out there on the grates or the lawn to going 
into one of those shelters 
he told abcs david brinkley that he didnt understand why the 
homeless dont get jobs when the local paper carries up to 75 pages 
of help wanted ads each sunday reagan also said a large percentage 
of homeless people are mentally retarded 
the american civil liberties union attacked reagans remarks 
broadcast thursday as mean spirited and insensitive saying the 
number of homeless has increased dramatically under his 
administration estimates range into the hundreds of thousands with 
more than 15000 of those in the nations capital 
every man interviewed on the triangle formed by 20th and e 
streets and virginia avenue four blocks from the white house said 
he would rather live under a roof 
but they all said life on washingtons grates is better than life 
in homeless shelters which havent got enough room to take in all of 
the capitals homeless 
given the choice of one of the grates and the urine and the 
lice and the maggots ill take the grates said robert jackson 
as a stiff hot updraft warmed a small circle of men in their 20s 
and 30s over the christmas weekend 
robert moens 29 said the shelters are full of drug addicts 
freed mental patients transvestites and criminals 
youve got people in there who would steal the stink out of 
your shoes he said 
the men agreed that plenty of jobs are available and some of 
them have jobs two said they work fulltime for the federal 
government one has delivered pizzas and used to sleep in his 
delivery uniform under the trees on the triangle 
but they say none of the jobs pays enough to get a man off the 
grates 
moens said he can earn good money by submitting to safe 
scientific testing at university laboratories but he said he 
recently had to send 1000 for support of his two children who live 
with their greatgrandmother and he only has enough to rent a 
storage shed for his belongings 
moens said reagan is partly right about the great number of 
mentally ill on the streets 
it was all done with good intentions when they started 
releasing people who were not a danger to others he said but 
its more inhuman to let them stay out here and fend for themselves 
some of them are psychotic and should be locked up 
go go joe who wouldnt give his real name because he doesnt 
want relatives to know how hes living said he prides himself on 
good hygiene and believes deeply in jesus christ 
he said he has had several 335anhour minimum wage jobs 
i challenge president reagan to live on that he said 
the sheriff who also would not give his real name showed his 
photo on a plastic defense department identification card and said 
he was working as a supervisor at the pentagon he also said hed 
been in prison on a weapons charge until a year ago 
i have clothes i take showers i work out at the pentagon gym 
i dont want pity im just in washington trying to get a 
foothold said the man who is 35 
this is our living room he said and thats our television 
set pointing to the street a partially demolished building a 
classy apartment house a drug store and a liquor store 
liquor store coowner brian fischer has a different view of the 
grates 
some of the men are his friends and one once brought him to 
tears a fellow named allen came in so cold he couldnt fasten his 
jacket 
when he asked me to help him zip up i got an image of my 
7yearold kid and i cried said fischer 
but some men out there are seriously mentally ill and others are 
criminals who find refuge in the anonymity of street life he said 
the media builds up these people too much he said a lot 
of them fight over the grates with bottles 
when an elderly whitebearded derelict called wolfman died a few 
weeks ago after living on the streets for more than two decades his 
body lay on a grate for three hours before anyone came to take it 
away fischer said 
the president has a very valid point about them preferring to 
live on the grates rather than in the washington shelters said 
fischer but criminals in prison are treated better than these 
people

the chief investigator into the crash 
of pan am flight 103 said today that a suitcase and pieces of 
wreckage were sent to a military research center to see if they show 
signs of an precrash explosion 
mick charles head of a team of 40 us and british investigators 
at the site also said there was no evidence yet of a structural 
failure in the jumbo jet but that the possibility was still being 
actively investigated 
an expert on air disasters blamed structural failure for the 
crash and was quoted as saying the boeing 747s left wing which has 
not been found could have fallen into the sea ripped off as the 
nose tore away 
also today police investigated reports that looters were 
scouring the wreckage from the plane during the night in search of 
rings jewlery and cash and authorities arrested a man on suspicion 
of looting 
the violence of the disaster in southwest scotland was such that 
five days after britains worstever aviation wreck it has not yet 
been possible to identify even one of the 239 bodies recovered 
searchers still had to find an estimated 30 more bodies 
no more bodies were found on sunday pan am said 258 were aboard 
the night flight to new york and 11 townspeople were listed as 
missing 
charles said some pieces of wreckage from the boeing 747 and a 
suitcase were being sent to a military research center for 
examination to determine whether they exhibit evidence of 
preimpact explosion 
his statement was issued by the department of transport 
charles said on friday that investigators had no evidence of 
sabotage in the crash of the pan am jet over this picturesque town 
in southwest scotland 
the sabotage theory emerged after an islamic group claimed 
responsibility the us government said it had been warned of a 
threat against a pan am flight from frankfurt to new york and 
flight recorders showed the pilots apparently had no warning before 
the plane broke up suddenly at 31000 feet 
flight 103 started in frankfurt and changed aircrafts in london 
charles brief statement today said 
although because of the fragmented and scattered nature of the 
wreckage the investigation of the structual aspect of the accident 
is a slow process no evidence of a structual failure has so far 
been found however the possibility of such a failure is still 
being actively investigated 
some pieces of wreckage and a suitcase are today being taken to 
the royal armament research and development establishment at fort 
halstead for more detailed examination to determine whether they 
exhibit evidence of a preimpact explosion 
the ministry of defense said the fort halstead center near biggin 
hill in kent does research and development on armor and exlosives 
an expert on air disasters was quoted today as saying he thought 
structural failure to the rear of the cockpit was the cause 
william tench britains former chief inspector of air accidents 
and now a consultant on aircraft accidents to the defense ministry 
and the european economic community told the times of london there 
was no evidence of a bomb 
tench said the jets left wing which has not been found could 
have fallen into the sea ripped off as the nose tore away the 
wind could then have blown the wing into the sea which is just 10 
miles south of lockerbie 
if the wing had broken off at the root the disruption of the 
electrical system would have been substantial possibly precluding 
the sending of a mayday distress call tench was quoted as 
saying 
if the wing is missing this raises the question of whether 
there was a structural failure resulting from overstressing in 
extreme weather conditions which were in the area at the time 
the times quoted tench as saying 
police said today that they had arrested a local 28yearold man 
on suspicion of looting the announcement followed reports in the 
sun britains largestcirculation newspaper that looters were 
scouring wreckage from the plane under cover of night in search of 
rings jewlery and cash 
police said the suspect might be taken before the sheriffs court 
in nearby dumfries when it reopens on wednesday 
police spokesman angus kennedy said steady rain today might 
hamper a helicopter survey of the search corridor which now extends 
15 miles east of lockerbie where most of the boeing 747 rained to 
the ground in large pieces

john mulroy described by a colleague as a 
balding leprechaun six feet tall was a man who made things work 
an emergency electrical system for the associated press in lima 
to use when guerrilla actions led to blackouts 
a satellite setup that carried ap accounts of the olympic games 
in seoul to a receiver in london and on to the worlds newspapers 
and broadcasters 
a balky communications link in hong kong with repairs 
prescribed long distance while he was in a hotel room in istanbul 
morning hows everything he said before he talked the hong 
kong correspondent through the problem apologizing that the 
telephone conversation would have to share his attention with a 
hasty shave so that he could get to the airport 
many days john mulroy lived on airplanes 
last wednesday he died on one 
mulroy 59 director of international communications for the ap 
was one of 258 people killed aboard pan am flight 103 when it 
crashed into a village in southern scotland across the irish sea 
from his native ireland 
his son sean 25 his daughterinlaw ingrid and three other 
members of his family died with him 
airplane stories were part of the mulroy lore he was the 
unflappable flier hed take his seat make the sign of the cross 
and take a nap while the plane climbed to altitude 
he caught the last plane out of ankara in a march blizzard this 
year cheerful and joking through a flight that clipped a snowbank 
on takeoff and bounced through gale force winds afterward 
heading from tokyo to moscow he looked down at siberia if we 
have to go down here it will take them a long time to find us he 
told a colleague and its cold too 
mulroy a 25year veteran of pan am before he joined the ap 4 12 
years ago enjoyed flying 
if youre in a vibrant moving industry its always 
pleasant he said in an interview conducted for the ap employee 
magazine on nov 30 because you get off the plane and you know 
theres something to be done and youve got to move forward 
for all the millions of miles he covered mulroy said he knew 
nothing about jet lag i can get on an airplane to sleep or to 
work one of the two and i get off the airplane ready to go to work 
again 
he spoke in what lou boccardi president of the ap called an 
authoritative whisper it was unmistakably irish a heritage that 
was his pride he was a naturalized us citizen 
mulroy and his wife joan sent their three children sean 
siobhan 26 and brendan 23 back to ireland to attend high 
school the family vacationed there each summer in a house at 
cloongee near mulroys birthplace 
hed built it for his father a widower who raised six children 
by himself when his father died it became mulroys irish base 
hed had it renovated and enlarged and was planning to spend more 
time there after he retired although there were those who wagered 
he wouldnt have retired anyhow 
mulroys roman catholic faith was deeply held he counted an 
audience and brief conversation with pope john paul ii one of the 
high points of his life 
in seoul for the olympics he slipped away to attend mass at a 
korean church i didnt understand a word of it but it was 
grand he said 
at the end of another korean mass the priest switched to 
english greeted mulroy and a colleague and asked them to stand 
mulroy was up in an instant nodding and smiling as 800 korean 
churchgoers applauded he took the arm of his shy colleague and 
pulled him up too 
a memorial mass was being said monday night at st francis of 
assisi church in greenlawn on long island 
after his quartercentury career at pan am where he began as a 
long island city ticket agent and became director of communications 
mulroy joined the ap in august 1984 
it quickly became part of his identity and vice versa he was 
known worldwide as the ap man in moscow he joined all the toasts 
but scrimped on the vodka at the great wall of china he 
encountered a group of quigong masters men studied in the chinese 
way of harnessing vital powers he watched as four of them lifted 
their teacher using only their thumbs then they lifted mulroy 
although not very far 
when bureaucrats and import restrictions got in the way of making 
things work he knew how to talk cajole or smuggle his way around 
them 
his handshake was as firm crushing to some as his brogue was 
hoarse and whispery that low voice took on a different significance 
to his colleagues only after his death when they learned that he 
had suffered from cancer and had a lung removed about six years ago 
before he joined the ap he told no one he didnt want it thought 
that he was less than fit or that he should ease his pace 
he never did because his assignment was worldwide time zones 
meant nothing the telephone rang at his home in east northport on 
long island at all hours and mulroy would answer at 3 am with 
a sweetly irish good morning 
one call came while he was in ireland fishing near his house 
his wife joan called him in mulroy dealt with the problem you 
made me miss catching my dinner you owe me one he said 
he had that right the ap and its people owed him more than one 
and the feeling was mutual mulroy was proud of his company and his 
colleagues some he designated honorary irishmen among them masaaki 
iwasa of tokyo and francois ghattas of beirut and nicosia 
a small group but the greatest bunch of talent ive ever 
seen mulroy said of his ap associates in the nov 30 interview 
hours and time never seem to matter 
mulroy set the standard as he left an ap town the words that 
came just before goodbye were a litany 
if you need anything at all just let me know

special kiosks in major cities will begin selling a 
few hundred copies of western newspapers and magazines beginning 
jan 1 the tass news agency said monday 
the fact that the new arrivals which certainly cannot be 
called prosoviet will be sold here at all says a lot about 
increased openness in the soviet union the official news agency 
said 
but the small number of papers to be made available and the 
average readers lack of knowledge of english ensure that few people 
will have access to the publications 
tass said among the publications to be sold from the special 
kiosks will be the guardian the times and the financial times from 
britain the international herald tribune and the magazines time 
and newsweek 
tass initially said 350 copies of the guardian and 400 copies of 
the financial times and international herald tribune will be sold 
daily it did not say where besides moscow they will be sold 
the number of papers offered for sale are likely to increase the 
report said 
distribution of such publications have long been prohibited in 
the soviet union on ideological grounds but since the moscow summit 
between president mikhail s gorbachev and president reagan a 
limited number have been available at the soviet foreign ministrys 
press center 
access to the press center generally is limited to accredited 
correspondents so few people had the opportunity to buy the papers 
there

the chinese people must be prepared for two or 
three hard years while the government imposes austerity measures to 
battle economic problems the communist partys official daily 
newspaper said monday 
the masses must tighten their belts for the next few years as the 
nation comes to grips with faltering agricultural production high 
inflation and overspending of public funds the peoples daily said 
in a frontpage commentary 
the editorial was the latest piece in the official media to 
hammer home the seriousness of the economic crisis which has seen 
inflation soar to 26 percent and industrial growth shoot up to an 
unsustainable level of almost 20 percent 
although incomes as a whole are rising surveys have shown that 
up to 20 percent of urban residents report that their living 
standards are declining as a result of the rise in retail prices 
in september the government announced a twoyear economic 
retrenchment plan under which the government will slash funding for 
new construction projects impose controls over credit prices and 
raw materials distribution and slow the pace of marketoriented 
reforms 
the measures have had some small successes in cooling off the 
economy but have run into resistance from local authorities trying 
to protect pet projects 
the overheated economy can be cooled down and economic health 
restored only when all departments consider the interests of the 
whole and share the burden the daily said 
it said that although the economy looks very good as a result of 
rapid economic expansion there are in fact a lot of potential 
dangers 
the foundation of the economy is weak it said with a large 
population inadequate natural resources and a shortage of funds 
but many people have forgotten this 
new buildings continue to go up while some localities compete for 
high economic growth and indiscriminately distribute big bonuses 
among employees 
some people import goods blindly and spend foreign currency 
without plan and some people eat and drink and spend money 
extravagantly if we dont cool down the overheated economy it 
will surely lead to crisis 
the daily said the need to live a hard life does not mean that 
economic construction will be halted rather there will be a shift 
from dependence on increasing investment and expanding production to 
reliance on improving management upgrading technology and raising 
economic efficiency

north korea on monday invited radical 
students from south korea to an international youth festival next 
year in its capital according to a north korean letter 
officials said the letter was sent through the border village of 
panmunjom and addressed to south koreas national council of student 
representatives a radical student organization 
the letter called for the two sides to meet at the border in 
march to arrange the participation of south korean students in the 
13th world festival of youth and students to be held july 18 in 
the north korean capital of pyongyang 
in the invitation north korea characterized the international 
festival as an event where students seeking the unification of the 
divided peninsula can form a common movement 
the peninsula was divided in 1945 at then end of world war ii 
when soviet and us troops ended japans colonial rule 
the quadrennial festival is a political arts and sports event in 
which most of the participants are from communist and third world 
nations the last such festival was held in moscow in 1985 
radical students said there was no reason to avoid our 
participation in events in north korea but government officials 
maintain that all dialogue with north korea should be conducted 
through government channels 
south korean officials said the radical students were invited to 
strengthen antius and antigovernment activism 
in june and august police blocked thousands of radical students 
who tried to stage a crosscountry march to the border where they 
were to hold unification talks with north korean students the 
police blockades triggered violent street protests 
radical students a small but powerful minority on campuses have 
seized on national unification as part of their antigovernment 
antius strategy but they have failed to garner strong public 
support 
north korea in recent months has called for dialogue with seoul 
through various channels but south korean officials consider the 
overtures as attempts to remove us troops and cause social unrest 
dissident students are demanding the withdrawal of 42000 us 
troops based in south korea under a mutual defense treaty saying 
the united states has hampered unification 
in preparation for the youth festival north korea is building 
new hotels in pyongyang with a capacity of 2600 guests the 
official north korean news agency reported monday the korean 
central news agency said one facility the 33story chongnyon hotel

camps following brutal suppression of a prodemocracy uprising 
returned home monday from thailand aboard two burmese air force 
planes 
about 7000 students and others remained along the thaiburmese 
border where many have vowed to fight the rangoon government 
alongside ethnic minority rebels 
the 80 students were repatriated after burma asked the thai 
government for help in getting them back they fled rangoon and 
other areas of the country following the sept 18 military coup by 
gen saw maung 
we dont know how to express our happiness to be back in burma 
after nearly three months of ordeal said saw hla a student from 
rangoon the students along the border have been suffering from 
malaria poor nutrition and other hardships of jungle life

by thai army commander gen chaovalit yongchaiyudh saw maungs 
government reportedly pledged that returning students wont be 
harmed it also said thai and red cross officials would be allowed 
in to monitor the status of the returnees

repatriation of the students but indicated it might give an 
extension the thai government set up a transit camp at tak near 
the burmese border where those intending to return are being housed

were accompanied by two thai aircraft carrying thai journalists

sent to their home areas government spokesman kyaw sann said

uprising during which the military gunned down largely unarmed 
demonstrators by the hundreds

americans believe president reagan has helped the 
rich and hurt the poor but a wide majority nonetheless approve of 
his work in the white house according to a national poll 
majorities in the media generalassociated press survey gave 
negative grades to reagans social policies and ethics enforcement 
rated his judgment unfavorably and said they would not have 
supported him for a third term 
at the same time an overwhelming twothirds approved of the way 
reagan has done his job overall and said history will view him 
positively and 55 percent said he has bettered the nation 
the telephone survey was conducted among a random sample of 1084 
adults shortly after last months election reagan leaves office 
jan 20 
the poll found two factors at the heart of reagans popularity 
wide belief that his economic policies have helped the nation and 
high regard for his leadership he also scored well on defense and 
ussoviet relations 
reagans ratings flagged elsewhere while nearly twothirds said 
his economic policies have been good for the nation for example a 
mighty 80 percent rated his handling of the budget deficit 
negatively 
moreover 54 percent said the poor are worse off economically as 
a result of reagans policies and 72 percent said wealthy americans 
are better off opinion was more divided on the middle class 
onethird called it worse off a quarter said better off and the 
rest saw little change 
a third of respondents said they and their families were better 
off as a result of reagans efforts and 18 percent said worse off 
but they split evenly when asked to score reagans handling of the 
economy and more than twice as many picked the worst rating as 
chose the best the poll gave excellent or good as positive 
choices only fair or poor as negatives 
reagan received negative ratings for his handling of every social 
issue posed civil rights 51 percent negative education 54 
percent negative housing 65 percent negative and welfare 67 
percent negative six in 10 rated him negatively on his handling of 
ethics in government 
in all these gauges reagan fared worst among democrats but also 
was rated negatively by most independents majorities of republicans 
endorsed him on most issues but not on the deficit welfare or 
housing 
on two other issues he scored extraordinarily well seven in 10 
rated him favorably for defense policies and eight in 10 rated him 
positively on handling relations with the soviets 
six in 10 viewed reagans other foreign policies favorably the 
poll was done before he opened contact with the palestine liberation 
organization this month 
even with his mixed policy ratings six in 10 respondents ranked

there was no christmas lull in 
the fighting between black factions in natal province despite a 
peace appeal from archbishop desmond tutu and police said nine more 
blacks have died in the countrys worst conflict 
most died from stab wounds in six separate incidents sunday in 
the troubled province a dozen homes were set afire 17 people were 
injured and police used tear gas to break up two street battles 
more than 1000 blacks have been killed in natal in the past two 
years in the feuding between supporters of militant antiapartheid 
groups and members of inkatha a more moderate movement led by zulu 
politician mangosuthu buthelezi 
tutu the 1984 nobel peace prize laureate who heads southern 
africas anglican church last week deplored the violence in this 
southeastern province 
when we are meant to be celebrating the birth of the prince of 
peace the killing looks as though it is escalating the black 
archbishop said in such a situation it is easy to be dispairing 
calling for peace can seem a meaningless ritual 
black leaders had expressed optimism in september when officials 
of inkatha and the congress of south african trade unions signed a 
peace pact in the natal provincial capital pietermaritzburg the 
militant labor federation is allied with the banned united 
democratic front an umbrella organization for antiapartheid 
groups in the power struggle against inkatha 
the agreement condemned violence and established a board to 
review residents complaints of harassment or attacks 
the pact remains in effect but has had limited success some 
witnesses have been afraid to testify and many supporters of the 
united democratic front which is banned from holding meetings felt 
they were not consulted about the agreement 
this month increasing violence has further dimmed the hopes 
raised by the peace pact on dec 3 gunmen fired into a house in 
trust feed a black community near pietermaritzburg and killed 11 
people including children who were holding an allnight vigil for 
a child who had died 
news reports initially blamed inkatha for the massacre buthelezi 
later claimed the victims were inkatha members and threatened to sue 
anyone who blamed his organization 
on dec 17 residents of caluza also near pietermaritzburg said 
inkatha members rampaged through town killing three people and 
damaging dozens of homes while police stood by 
police officials deny any partiality in the conflict 
tutu in his peace appeal raised the issue of police bias 
i am very disturbed to hear reports that people do not perceive 
the police as a force which protects them but rather as a group 
which favors those who claim allegiance to the inkatha movement 
he said 
the countrys largestselling black daily newspaper the sowetan 
said in a recent editorial the reign of terror in natal was a 
shame and a disgrace 
both inkatha which claims 15 million members and the united 
democratic front oppose the apartheid policies under which south 
africas 5 million whites dominate the 26 million blacks who have 
not voice in national affairs but the strategies of the two groups 
differ markedly 
the front a predominantly black coalition of about 600 groups 
advocates economic sanctions strikes and other confrontational 
tactics to bring about sweeping political and economic change 
inkatha which opposes sanctions and shuns militant protest 
accuses the front of supporting the violence of the outlawed african 
national congress the largest guerrilla group fighting the 
government

soviet economic openness toward the west 
is only budding but it already has produced some flowers even 
though theyre plastic 
the first parcel of plastic flowers and kitchenware from the 
southern soviet city of tashkent reached this port city a couple of 
weeks ago palpable proof that joint ventures with soviet companies 
are not necessarily mired in delays and red tape 
there are already dividends after only one year said frans 
moens of the antwerp plastic merchandising co 
moens holding a bouquet of red plastic roses said antwerp 
plastic controls one of europes oldest producers of plastic flowers 
italys alma rose spa which was approached last year by the 
soviets 
alma rose had long wanted to be a trailblazer with the soviets 
since the early 1970s it offered its services but always met a 
nyet leonid brezhnevstyle said moens referring to the 
former soviet leader 
but things moved quickly with the emergence of mikhail s 
gorbachev and his program for economic reform 
talks started in march 1987 and six months later the 40 million 
joint venture sovplastital was founded a soviet state company holds 
78 percent of the shares with the remainder held by alma rose on 
the board of directors however parity reigns 
key to doing successful business with the soviets said moens 
was setting up an allencompassing business plan the soviets 
rigorously stick to the plan but absolutely everything has to be in 
it he said he compared this with the more practical approach of 
european businesses 
for tashkent the soviets wanted machines materials and the 
knowhow to refine the plastic products while gaining an export 
market to earn them foreign currency 
antwerp plastic and alma rose gained a new production unit 
where wages are still low and a market of 280 million potential 
customers the market is simply enormous and still has to be 
claimed said moens 
an antwerp plastic official who demanded anonymity also said 
alma rose wanted to reduce production in italy because of the many 
labor strikes that is not the case in the soviet union 
the factory in tashkent employs 800 workers and plans to add 300 
soon moens said 
the plastic wares including flowers hotcolored pots in the 
shape of pears and apples and plates of intertwined fake leaves are 
mainly sold domestically through state shops but the joint venture 
already has set up westernstyle shops in tashkent and moscow 
moens said the mayor of leningrad also made inquiries about a 
shop 
as the first belgian company involved in a soviet joint venture 
antwerp plastic often is asked for information about six companies 
mostly in the chemical sector are negotiating but no deals have 
come through

the kremlin ideology chief in a speech published 
monday attacked some staterun publications for sensationalism and a 
lack of regard for facts under president mikhail s gorbachevs 
policy of greater openness 
vadim a medvedev who was named to the ruling communist party 
politburo by gorbachev in september and immediately given control 
over ideology and propaganda also indicated there would be no 
lessening of control over the mass media 
people are concerned about hysteria sensationalism the 
destructive direction of some statements the inciting of passions 
lack of regard for the facts a deficit of professionalism and 
other tendencies in the soviet press medvedev said in a speech to 
local party officials in kazan 
the mass media must obey general laws develop in the framework 
of the laws of socialist government he said a new law on the 
press is being written but no law can take away the civic 
position the party responsibility of the leaders of the mass media 
of our entire journalistic body 
his comments at the dec 2324 conference were published monday 
by the communist party newspaper pravda 
statecontrolled press and publishers have used the new 
atmosphere of greater freedom under gorbachev to publish material 
that were not acceptable or were banned for years under gorbachevs 
predecessors 
but since taking control over the partys ideology and propaganda 
apparatus medvedev also has signaled that glasnost the policy 
of greater openness has definite limits 
on nov 29 medvedev told a news conference that he opposed 
publication of works by exiled writer alexander solzhenitsyn because 
they would undermine soviet society some writers artists and 
activists in informal political groups have been clamoring for 
publication of works by the nobelprize winning author who was 
stripped of his citizenship and exiled in 1974 
medvedevs speech was one of a series published by pravda on 
monday by top party leaders at regional conferences reviewing local 
party membership in accord with a directive from the june communist 
party conference to cleanse party rolls of people who were standing 
in the way of gorbachevs reform policies 
medvedev also criticized party and government traditionalists 
who he said were standing in the way of gorbachev reforms he said 
the party was trying to steer a course between extremists who wanted 
no reform and those who wanted too much too fast 
his statement contrasted with a speech in the ural mountains city 
of perm two weeks ago by politburo member alexander n yakovlev who 
emphasized the need for more democracy and openness 
democracy glasnost and differences of opinion still frighten 
us as if every one of us constantly lives in agreement with himself 
and always thinks in comfortable cliches said yakovlev 
considered the politburo member closest to gorbachev can you 
really call a person a person if he doesnt have his own opinions 
yakovlev asked 
pravda said medvedevs comments on the soviet media referred to a 
few publications it did not identify but they most likely referred 
to the handful of journals and newspapers that have been pushing the 
frontiers of gorbachevs glasnost policy to publish revelations 
about soviet history and social problems that previously never would 
have surfaced in the official press 
leading those publications are the weeklies ogonyok and moscow 
news more conservative publications continue to publish less 
controversial material except for several instances in which open 
disputes have broken out in the pages of the official media between 
progressive and traditional papers 
the accusation that some publications were inciting passions also 
was likely aimed at local newspapers in the baltic republics and in 
the southern republics of armenia and azerbaijan 
in both places the official media accused local media of adding 
to ethnic rather than quieting it 
medvedev also served notice on informal political organizations 
that have sprung up outside the communist party that they will be 
tolerated only as long as they do not run counter to party policy 
medvedev said the informal groups are a natural part of the 
process of restructuring some people he said are using a 
healthy process for establishing and movement of antisocialist 
goals 
our main criterion for determining relations with autonomous 
organizations is their correspondence with the goals of 
restructuring ideological renewal socialist choice he said

the national assembly taiwans electoral 
college said monday it will consider a request from president lee 
tenghui that would limit the number of terms a president can hold 
lee 65 proposed the change sunday when the national assembly 
convened a special threeday session to commemorate the anniversary 
of the adoption of the nationalist constitution on dec 25 1947 
under the constitution a president is limited to two consecutive 
sixyear terms the clause was revised by an emergency decree in 
1960 that allowed nationalist leader chiang kaishek to serve as 
president until his death in 1975 chiang was president for 27 years 
he was later succeeded by his son chiang chingkuo who served 
10 years before he died earlier this year the younger chiang was 
succeeded by lee who is serving out the remainder of chiangs term 
which expires in may 1990 
the nationalists retreated to taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil 
war to the communists in mainland china both the nationalists and 
communist chinese maintain they are the legitimate government of 
both taiwan and china 
the emergency decree extending the presidential term was passed 
at a time of heightened tension between the rival chinese 
governments 
before his death chiang chingkuo initiated democratic reforms 
that included a more lenient nationalist policy toward the 
communists lee has vowed to continue the policy 
he told the national assembly a limited presidential term would 
make the government more responsive to the publics demand for 
democracy 
members of the opposition democratic progressive party who 
disrupted sundays session wants the emergency decree abolished 
because they say it gives the president too much power 
lee the first native taiwanese to head the nationalist 
government gave no indication what limit to the presidential term 
he supports but observers say he is likely to back the twoterm 
presidency 
of the 894 members of the national assembly 768 belong to the 
governing nationalist party lee who is chairman of the party is 
expected to be a candidate for election to his first full term as 
president in 1990

prime minister noboru takeshita is expected to 
announce a cabinet reshuffle this week after months of bitter 
parliamentary battles over controversial tax reform and a 
stockprofiteering scandal 
an annual reshuffle of cabinet posts is a firmly established 
custom in japan said seizaburo sato a political science 
professor at tokyo university only 20 portfolios are available he 
said and prime ministers are expected to rotate senior parliament 
members through key posts at regular intervals 
takeshita has said he would announce changes in his cabinet 
sometime this month he is expected to do so soon after parliament 
ends its current extraordinary session tuesday 
press reports quoting unidentified sources said takeshita 
probably would retain those in top cabinet posts such as foreign 
minister sousuke uno and shintaro abe secretarygeneral of the 
governing liberal democratic party 
mr takeshita doesnt want to upset the status quo hell keep 
most important figures but there is a very strong push for some 
change sato said 
takeshitas administration has been under fire for the 
involvement of top party leaders in the recruit cosmos stock 
scandal in which influential figures profited from sales of stock 
bought at bargain prices before the shares were publicly listed 
takeshitas name is among those linked to the scandal 
opposition parties demanding a thorough inquiry into the scandal 
held up debate on tax reform until finance minister kiichi miyazawa 
resigned to take responsibility for an aides involvement in the 
stock deals which were legal although the ethics involved were 
questioned 
even then the path was rough for japans first tax overhaul 
since 1949 
public and political opposition already had delayed tax reform 
for a decade and takeshita made it a top priority when he assumed 
office in november 1987 opposition footdragging left him with the 
choice of abandoning the bills or forcing them through 
on saturday the liberal democratic party used its commanding 
parliamentary majority to enact a tax package that introduces a 3 
percent sales tax and cuts corporate and upperbracket income taxes 
immediately after the bills were passed takeshita named one of 
the architects of the tax reform tatsuo murayama as his new 
finance minister takeshita himself had been acting finance minister 
since dec 9 when miyazawa resigned 
approval ratings for the takeshita administration have plummeted 
over its handling of the stock scandal and tax package takeshitas 
tax victory was greeted with a chorus of criticism from the local 
press 
the pattern of the ruling party steamrolling its bills and 
stalling tactics by the opposition have been repeated so often 
that it goes to show just how sick japanese politics have 
become said the national newspaper asahi shimbun 
in an unusually vehement editorial the englishlanguage japan 
times said the whole process leading up to passage of the tax 
bill has illustrated in a disgusting way how arrogant the 
government party has become how deeply tainted by money the 
nations politics is how unprincipled many politicians and some 
political parties are 
the liberal democratic party said tax reform was needed to 
eliminate inequities in the tax burdens of salaried wage earners and 
the selfemployed opposition critics maintain however that the 
tax bill will do little to eliminate unfairness or close tax 
loopholes 
in addition to establishing the sales tax takeshitas tax 
package slashes duties on imported liquor and automobiles reduces 
the basic corporate tax rate from 42 percent to 375 percent and 
cuts the maximum income tax rate from 60 percent to 50 percent 
the most affected will again be pensioners and those in 
lowerincome brackets and salaried consumers who will have to 
pay more for food and other daily necessities covered by the new 
tax the japan times said

struggle front apparently were heading for israel when their rubber 
dinghy ran aground near the coastal town of jiye 15 miles south of 
beirut three guerrillas drowned and one surrendered to syrian

the two incidents suggested that radical factions opposed to 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat were bent 
on escalating their warfare against israel possibly to scuttle 
arafats recent peace overtures 
fatahrevolutionary council and the popular struggle front are 
among the splinter groups that have rejected arafats explicit

socialist prime minister felipe gonzalez and 
leaders of spains two biggest trade unions agreed monday to new 
talks to resolve differences that led to a paralyzing nationwide 
strike 
gonzalez announced he agreed to form a socioeconomic council 
with the unions to study five demands they made after the dec 15 
general work stoppage 
i hope this will continue to be a habit a future custom above 
all if we are able to institutionalize a forum for dialogue 
gonzalez told a news conference after meeting leaders of the 
socialist general workers unions and the communist workers 
commissions 
antonio gutierrez secretarygeneral of the communist union said 
the meeting was worthwhile but more progress could have been 
made 
union demands include increased wages for civil servants and 
pensioners hurt by an unexpected rise in inflation unemployment 
insurance for more workers and collective bargaining provisions for 
civil servants 
gonzalez already has agreed to a demand he withdraw a government 
plan to spur youth employment which included reducing minimum wages 
for those under 25 
in a dec 21 address to parliament he also said bowing to the 
unions demand to extend government unemployment insurance to cover 
48 percent of spains 27 million jobless was impossible because 
neither the budget nor the economy could stand it 
gonzalez told legislators that spanish civil servants had union 
rights equal to those in other european countries making the 
collective bargaining demand unnecessary 
he urged the unions to negotiate with the government to ensure 
the country maintains its 5 percent annual growth rate 
mondays fourhour meeting was the first encounter between 
representatives of government and organized labor since the dec 14 
strike in which 78 million of 118 million employed spaniards 
stayed home to call for a bigger share of benefits from the booming 
economy 
the two labor leaders boycotted a dec 22 meeting called by 
gonzalez because they objected to the presence of the head of the 
countrys main employers association 
after mondays meeting the socialist unions secretarygeneral 
nicolas redondo said he expected most negotiations to be limited to 
government and union representatives 
for certain concrete issues the business leaders could attend 
but not when we are trying to formulate a progressive employment 
policy he said 
labor leaders accuse the socialist government of siding with a 
thriving business community while abandoning workers still suffering 
wage restrictions and other concessions the unions made to help 
transform spains oncesluggish economy 
since the socialists first won a parliamentary majority in 1982 
annual inflation has been cut from more than 14 percent to just over 
5 percent but unemployment remains the highest in europe at 187 
percent

province of yugoslavia dominated by ethnic albanians an official

provinces constituted after the communists took power following

approximately 15 crew members christmas night when the california 
zephyr went off the tracks in glenwood canyon about 10 miles east 
of here and 150 miles west of denver

hour said passenger mike mettert of greenwood ind the train

a work train pulling seven cabooses brought the passengers and 
crew to glenwood springs where they were put in hotels said john 
jacobsen amtraks director of public affairs

the 15 cars and two locomotives on the amtrak train landed 
upright next to the tracks in the canyon which rises above the 
colorado river jacobsen said from his washington dc home today 
a third locomotive remained on the tracks 
the derailment was caused by a warped track jacobsen said 
the rail spread apart enough to cause the wheels to drop into a 
ridge between the rails he said the wheels dropped down 
between the rails and thats what kept it upright the train 
couldnt move because it was locked into place by the rail 
we know what happened not why it happened he said 
it was snowing like the dickens at the time of the accident 
a sheriffs dispatcher said and there was about a foot of snow at 
the derailment site 
until they were evacuated passengers remained on the train

sixteen military men and civilians 
arrested for plotting a coup had planned to assassinate top 
politicians and take over the armed forces command on dec 8 the 
sudan news agency said monday 
the state agency quoted a source at the armys general command as 
saying alleged plotters loyal to deposed president gaafar nimeiri 
had a twopart plan 
one group was to assassinate political leaders including 
civilian prime minister sadek elmahdi while another occupied vital 
and strategic departments such as the army general command and the 
radio station 
he did not say if others were suspected in the plot those 
arrested still were being interrogated and no charges had been put 
yet he said 
the military source said dec 7 alleged ringleader lt col 
hassan mohammed ahmed nasr told his associates that dec 8 was zero 
hour but that they would have problems securing fuel 
gasoline is rationed in sudan and car owners have to queue for 
several hours for their weekly supply 
the source said nasr recruited an army depot worker to supply the 
fuel but the coup plotters were arrested before they could make 
their move 
nine of the 16 arrested are military men he said including a 
retired major general two retired brigadiers five noncommissioned 
officers and lt col nasr he said another 1st lt mohammed 
suleiman still is at large 
the rest are politicians and other civilians who worked in 
nimeiris dissolved state security and special guards forces 
nimeiri was ousted april 5 1985 by the military who handed 
power to a democratically elected government in 1986 
nimeiri was stranded in cairo egypt and has remained there 
since he is not allowed any political activities by his egyptian 
hosts and there has not been any evidence linking him to the aborted 
coup 
in a separate development the government monday imposed huge 
price increases on sugar cigarettes and other commodities just two 
days after announcing salary increases for workers in both public 
and private sectors 
information minister abdulla mohammed ahmed announced the 
increases in a statement published by the state news agency 
from tuesday the price of a pound of sugar was increased more 
than 600 percent from 43 cents to 26 cents prices of imported and 
locally produced cigarettes were increased by 50 percent in 
addition the government imposed a 15 percent tax on all locally 
manufactured commodities 
on saturday prime minister sadek mahdi announced pay increases 
of between 500 percent and 50 percent for all workers on a sliding 
scale so lowest paid workers get the biggest increases 
although sudan produces more sugar than it needs there are 
continuous shortages fueled by smuggling to neighbouring countries 
like uganda zaire chad and ethiopia where the sweetener costs a 
lot more on the black market in khartoum a pound of sugar now 
costs between 43 and 61 cents 
ahmed said the government hopes the higher price will ration 
consumption and combat smuggling

richard carpenter says he still doesnt 
understand the 1983 death of his sister and singing partner karen 
carpenter but he feels the life of an entertainer had nothing to do 
with it 
miss carpenter died of complications brought on by anorexia 
nervosa an eating disorder characterized by extreme dieting her 
life and death are the subject of the tv movie the karen carpenter 
story on cbs next week 
if she had died in a more tangible way if she had been hit by 
a car it would have been equally tragic but something i could 
comprehend carpenter writes in the dec 31 issue of tv guide 
the eating disorder that killed her anorexia nervosa was little 
understood then and only a little more now 
carpenter is executive producer of the movie 
what would possess a woman like her to starve herself 
carpenter asks some people blame it on career pressure or a need 
to take more control over her life 
i dont think so i think she would have suffered from the same 
problem even if she had been a homemaker

the soviet union which for decades banned accurate 
maps as a security risk and outlawed public opinion surveys as 
anticommunist will allow the gallup poll to survey its citizens 
knowledge of geography it was reported monday 
the poll of 1500 to 2000 people apparently is aimed at 
discovering whether soviet citizens are as ignorant as americans of 
such basic facts as the location of great britain 
a recent international poll by gallup and the national geographic 
society found that three out of four americans couldnt find the 
persian gulf on a map and most couldnt find britain americans 
ranked sixth among the eight nations tested 
adult americans averaged 86 correct answers out of 16 far 
behind the swedes at 116 the west germans scored with 112 the 
japanese 97 the french 93 and the canadians 92 the americans 
outscored only the italians at 76 and the mexicans at 74 
now it appears that same test is coming to the soviet union 
izvestia said the planned poll is a joint project of gallup and the 
national geographic society aimed at determining the level of 
geographic knowledge of various countries 
although the soviets have broken with tradition and started their 
own public opinion polls in the past year this apparently is the 
first time a foreign firm will be permitted to conduct a survey on 
soviet soil albeit in conjunction with the soviet institute for 
sociological research 
for many years sociology was a lost science in the soviet union 
as marxistleninism claims all societies will inevitably develop 
into communism 
personal thoughts were grounds for imprisonment and public 
opinion polls were inconceivable 
maps are still sketchy and deliberately distorted with rivers 
shifted and whole sections of major cities excised the government 
admitted to that practice several months ago and promised that 
accurate maps were forthcoming many soviet citizens have difficulty 
reading maps as a result of these inaccuracies 
reliance on public transportation is also limits some citizens 
sense of direction 
follow bus no 7 may be the best advice a motorist can 
expect 
americans however dont fare much better according to gallup 
more than onethird could not pick out the westernmost city on a 
simple map its us poll found 
the gallup poll also will survey soviet consumers to determine 
what products they buy and what items they would like to purchase 
izvestia said 
that basic marketing question may sound a bit strange to soviet 
ears with a chronic severe shortage of nearly all consumer items 
most soviet consumers buy anything decent they find regardless of 
such niceties as size and then trade with friends 
the gallup poll also will question soviet consumers familiarity 
with americanmade products izvestia said 
soviets love western brand names and snap up shirts stickers 
hats almost anything imprinted with names like addidas nike and 
mercedes but the genuine western products are hard to come by as 
the soviet union has cut imports of consumer goods as its foreign 
income has fallen with the price of siberian oil and gas 
exact wording of the gallup survey questions is still being 
worked out but it should be completed by midjanuary izvestia said

except the rapid decompression and flew on for another 50 
miles said federal aviation administration spokesman jack barker in

flew it to 10000 feet an altitude that requires no 
pressurization in the cabin barker said 
passenger sam piazza 55 of boca raton fla said at first he 
and his wife thought a bomb had exploded 
we were cruising along and you could hear the rush of the wind 
and the pitch of the wind and all of a sudden you could hear a big 
pop piazza said 
bill tretter 25 of buffalo ny and three family members were 
waiting for lunch when the cabin lost pressure 
we were just going along and they were serving the firstclass 
passengers and all of a sudden air started to rush by and it was 
kicking up dust tretter said 
all 104 passengers planned to continue on to atlanta barker 
said there was no immediate indication of the cause of the crack 
he said 
barnette said he received the first report of the emergency 
landing request at 910 am 
as far as i was concerned it was a normal landing i asked if 
he needed assistance and he said no there was no emergency crews 
needed on the runway said the air traffic controller who guided 
the plane in he refused to be identified 
the roof of a boeing 737 was torn off during an aloha airlines 
flight on april 28 killing one person and injuring 61 others the 
accident prompted a federal investigation into the aging fleet of

angolan president jose eduardo dos 
santos says his countrys military successes against south africa 
led to the signing of namibias independence agreement according to 
a report received here monday 
angop angolas state news agency said dos santos praised the 
angolan armed forces during a ceremony sunday when he received 
copies of the treaties signed in new york on thursday by angola 
cuba and south africa 
there was no mention in the report about the agreement for the 
withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops from angola as a link to south 
african withdrawal from neighboring namibia which south africa has 
ruled for 73 years 
the angop report quoted dos santos as saying his government 
forces made an incalculable contribution to the cause of peace 
he declared they won the october 1987 battle for cuito cuanavale 
city the largest military battle ever fought in subsaharan 
africa the report did not indicate whether he mentioned cubans 
who supported angolan troops in the battle or the participation of 
guerrillas opposed to his government who reportedly still are 
fighting at cuito cuanavale 
the strategic town in southern angola was beseiged by south 
african forces and guerrillas of jonas savimbis national union for 
the total independence of angola dos santos said they never managed 
to capture the town 
savimbi said he did not want to occupy the town but forced 
angolan forces to abandon it and a plan to attack his headquarters 
at jamba 
dos santos was quoted as saying the defense of cuito cuanavale 
and ensuing military successes achieved with cuban soldiers at 
ruacana and calueque where many south african soldiers guarding 
dam installations were killed have changed the direction of 
events in southern africa and led the parties involved to 
negotiation 
the new york accords open the path to peace in southern africa 
since they have made inevitable a search for a political solution to 
the grave problem of apartheid in south africa he said

the blackrobed men chant hymns and divide 
their days between study and prayer in defiance of a catholic church 
they say they are trying to preserve 
in the eyes of pope john paul ii the 50 men at the only us 
seminary aligned with excommunicated archbishop marcel lefebvre are 
members of a rebel church but they believe it is the shepherd that 
has gone astray 
we love the pope and we pray for him every day said paul 
kimball a fifthyear student at st thomas aquinas seminary but 
we cant obey him when hes telling us to use the new mass until he 
converts and becomes a true catholic we cant obey him 
the seminary situated on a bluff above this mississippi river 
town is run by richard williamson one of four men excommunicated 
along with lefebvre last summer when the swiss prelate unilaterally 
consecrated them as bishops 
lefebvre and the fraternity of st pius x that he heads oppose 
many of the changes introduced by the second vatican council in the 
1960s including the holding of mass in the local language the 
group continues to use the latin mass from the 16th century 
although they hold to the church teaching that the pope is the 
vicar of christ on earth lefebvres supporters say the pontiff can 
also make mistakes

excommunicated catholic is not permitted to receive the churchs 
sacraments which include communion and last rites

the soviet union launched its first national 
multicandidate election campaign monday with 100 communist party 
members and ordinary citizens entering the race 
mondays nominees including a retired army general and economic 
reformer have exactly three months to win the suddenly unguaranteed 
votes of their comrades their campaigns may include free television 
time and an unpaid staff of 10 volunteers 
a government reform law november dropped decades of 
singlecandidate balloting for communist party nominees in favor of 
unlimited candidates for 2250 seats in the new congress of peoples 
deputies nominating will continue for another month and balloting 
is set for march 26 
even the official soviet news agency tass admitted monday that 
soviet elections were largely reduced to a formality in the past 
voters had no choice of candidates and nominees were chosen 
according to social status age and sex to guarantee filling quotas 
for factory workers and other demographic groups tass said 
in the time of soviet dictator josef stalin people who 
registered objections by vainly voting no risked a 25year 
prison term 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs reorganization precinct 
caucuses workers grouped by company or industry and certain public 
organizations ranging from the communist party to the academy of 
sciences may nominate an unlimited number of candidates 
congress will meet once a year and elect a nearly fulltime 
parliament from among its members 
the soviet union first experimented with multiple candidates in 
some local council elections june 1987 they resulted in the 
communist party losing its majority control in some councils to 
nonparty members 
nevertheless the party is guaranteed preeminence by the 
soviet constitution which also prohibits other political parties 
the one visible opposition group the democratic union spends much 
of its time agitating for the right to exist 
in moscow signs popped up monday identifying precinct meeting 
sites 
public interest was less than overwhelming however according to 
soviet media although work groups must have 500 members to nominate 
a candidate the vote in one minsk computer factory was just 368 a 
local communist party official overwhelmed her opponent a shift 
supervisor known for her honorable character and painstaking work 
mondays tass report answered one serious objection to 
gorbachevs reform plan the possibility a person could be elected 
to fill more than one congressional seat since twothirds of 
representatives will be chosen by territorial district and onethird 
from organizations it was possible a person could be nominated in 
his region and also by several organizations 
but tass said an election commission would register the nominees 
at the end of the first month of the campaign to prevent one person 
running in several districts simultaneously tass did not say if the 
commission would have the power to bar candidates for other reasons

the arab league council on monday said the 
united states risks serious repercussions in its relations with 
the arab world if it attacks libya 
the final resolution of a special session called by libya said an 
international organization was best suited to examine the us 
complaint that libya maintains a chemical weapons factory 
the council considers the american threats as a factor of 
tension itself threatening the international climate of detente and 
peace that arab states are trying to support and consolidate read 
the resolution which was unanimously adopted 
president reagan in a television interview last week said 
washington has been discussing with its allies the possibility of 
taking military action to destroy a libyan factory it claims can 
produce enormous quantities of chemical weapons 
us spokesmen have said military action was only one of several 
options 
libya denies the charge says the factory is producing 
pharmaceuticals and declared its full commitment to all 
international conventions banning chemical weapons 
also on monday kuwait joined iran iraq syria and the palestine 
liberation organization in pledging to back libya in the event of a 
us attack 
these threats are not directed against libya alone but against 
the entire arab world foreign minister sheik sabah ahmed told the 
kuwait news agency kuwait stands by sister libya against any 
aggression it might confront 
the arab league resolution said questions in particular those 
of a military character should be submitted to competent 
international organizations such as the united nations and the 
international atomic energy agency 
us spokesmen have said they would like the issue examined at an 
international conference in paris jan 711 to consider ways of 
enforcing the 1925 geneva convention outlawing chemical weapons 
the resolution reaffirmed the arab leagues solidarity with libya 
and warned the united states that any attempt at an aggression 
against this state risks the most serious repercussions in the 
region and in arabamerican relations 
it further accused israel of using chemical weapons in southern 
lebanon and the occupied territories 
the council notes with surprise the silence of the united 
states in the face of israels use and fabrication and stockage 
of these prohibited arms it said 
no one has made such accusations before the israeli government 
customarily refuses to confirm or deny foreign reports that it 
started to develop chemical arms after egypt used such weapons 
during its 196367 involvement in the civil war in yemen 
israeli leaders have vowed to retaliate thousandfold in the 
event of a chemical attack from the arab side 
arab league secretarygeneral chedli klibi opening the special 
session accused washington of violating the un charter and 
international law with its threat 
the new threats proffered by the united states evoke the 
astonishment of the arab states and are denounced by our peoples 
klibi said they show whats more the seriousness of a situation 
where a state no matter how important it is treats questions of 
international conflict outside the framework of the united nations 
the only appropriate framework 
the arab states warn against the inherent risks of the american 
accusations and against all aggression against one of them 
us warplanes bombed libya in 1986 in retaliation for the 
terrorist attack on a west berlin disco where two us servicemen 
and a turkish woman were killed and more than 200 soldiers and 
others were injured

the leading communist party daily on 
monday called on parliament to replace premier branko mikulic and 
his government because of failure to resolve yugoslavias worst 
postwar economic crisis 
mikulics government must fall because it was not able to carry 
out its own programs and to create a climate for an authentic start 
of economic reforms said the daily borba in a frontpage 
editorial 
yugoslavia is grappling with a 250 percent annual inflation rate 
15 percent unemployment a 21 billion foreign debt and growing 
labor unrest 
the yugoslav parliament should usher in the new year by 
replacing the current federal government borba said 
mikulic who came to power in 1986 indicated in a recent 
interview that he and his government had no intention of resigning 
no government or premier has resigned or been replaced in yugoslavia 
since the communists came to power after world war ii 
borba said that if the government is not replaced yugoslavia 
might be faced with severe labor unrest 
in 1988 workers staged a record 1000 strikes to protest low 
wages and plunging living standards that have dropped to the 
mid1960s level according to official statistics 
the patience of the yugoslav working class is running low 
borba said 
in another development a former official was expelled from the 
communist party on monday for his alleged involvement in a 
realestate scandal in the central republic of bosnia the official 
tanjug news agency reported 
a party disciplinary commission expelled todo kurtovic for using 
political influence to secure favorable bank loans to build a 
luxurious vacation home on the central adriatic coast 
kurtovic came to prominence as of the partys top ideologues in 
the 1970s when he headed the communistled socialist alliance and 
authored books on socialism 
the parliament of bosna demanded last week that legislation be 
passed allowing authorities to confiscate homes belonging to several 
hundred bosnian politicians who obtained illegal bank loans to build 
them 
they include milanko renovica until last year president of the 
partys ruling politburo and nikola stojanovic a former member of 
the politburo 
mikulic who is from bosnia has also been linked to the 
realestate scandal but the premier last week denied repeated 
allegations that he owned illegallyfinanced property in bosnia 
according to press reports bosnian politicians qualified for the 
loans by having local banks order a temporary transfer of foreign 
currency from the accounts of yugoslavs working abroad to the 
applicants account the foreign currency served as collateral to 
secure the loan and would then be returned to the original 
accounts such services were repaid with political favors and rapid 
promotions according to the reports 
the terms of the loans did not include the usual adjustments for 
inflation thus reducing the real value of the mortgage to what one 
press report called the value of a pack of cigarettes

plo chief yasser arafat and his top aides 
concluded a threeday meeting monday focused on means of advancing 
the peace process in the middle east a plo official said 
one development reported from the 15member plo executive 
committee meeting was a decision to upgrade the status of plo 
offices to embassies in countries that have recognized the 
independent palestinian state ninety countries have recognized the 
state so far officials said 
azzam alahmed director of the palestine liberation organization 
office in baghdad said the leaders discussed a host of issues 
during five closeddoor sessions including the latest dialogue with 
the united states the formation of a provisional government in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip and the yearold uprising 
there 
alahmed would not specify on any conclusions saying a statement 
would be issued later 
sources close to the executive committee said sunday the members 
agreed that in further talks with the united states the plo should 
stress greater us recognition of the group and the need for an 
international peace conference 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the plo 
will urge the united states to recognize it as the sole and 
legitimate representative of the palestinian people 
earlier this month washington broke a 13year ban on contacts 
with the plo talks were held in tunis tunisia several days later 
the committee also broached the topic of forming a provisional 
government a palestinian spokesman said he said the issue needed 
further discussion 
arafat was quoted monday as telling the west german magazine 
spiegel that an independent palestinian state must have a corridor 
through israel connecting the west bank and gaza strip 
in november the palestine national council the plos 
parliamentinexile declared an independent palestinian state but 
did not specify its borders 
we can negotiate over that in the peace conference arafat 
was quoted as telling spiegel of the borders 
but in all cases we will insist on establishing a corridor 
between west jordan the west bank and the gaza strip it is not 
acceptable for us to establish a state split into two parts

hosni mubarak learned international diplomacy 
under anwar sadat but unlike his mercurial predecessor the 
egyptian president avoids grand gestures calculated to succeed 
through their shock value 
sadat the only arab president ever to visit israel announced 
his stunning 1977 trip to jerusalem from the podium of egypts 
parliament it was so unbelievable many journalists in the audience 
reported it as a figure of speech not a literal commitment to take 
his peace campaign to the parliament of the enemy 
by contrast when mubarak said over the christmas weekend he also 
would go to israel if it would help bring peace he used visiting 
journalists one kuwaiti one japanese to convey the message 
the message a very tentative initiative reflected the 
57yearold mubaraks characteristic caution 
why not go if this visit would lead to solving the 
arabisraeli problem and if it would lead to establishing a just 
peace then i am ready he told the kuwaiti newspaper alanbaa 
and on sunday he repeated in an interview with tokyos yomiuri 
shimbun that he would be willing to go but said i have no plans 
it depends i dont accept any preconditions 
that seemed a slight step back from previous pronouncements in 
which mubarak said there would be no reason for him to meet with 
yitzhak shamir unless the hardline israeli prime minister changed 
his policies 
but it also sent a signal to shamir who welcomed the idea of a 
mubarak visit not to insist as a condition of his invitation that 
mubarak go to jerusalem that would imply egyptian acceptance of 
israels annexation of the eastern part of the city which israel 
occupied in the 1967 war 
in 1982 there was talk of a mubarak trip but it never got off 
the ground because the israelis wanted him in jerusalem 
such considered signalsending diplomacy has been a hallmark of 
mubaraks seven years in office which began after a national 
referendum a week after moslem extremists assassinated sadat on oct 
6 1981 
the opening to israel and the peace treaty that followed two 
years later were among reasons the killers gave for the attack in 
which mubarak suffered a slight hand wound 
sadat passed over several generals senior to mubarak when he 
chose the generally colorless but goodnatured air force commander 
as vice president in 1975 
he relied heavily on mubarak who first drew sadats eye with his 
performance in the 1973 war mubaraks air force jets opened the war 
with a successful first strike against israeli positions in the 
occupied sinai that gave sadat the momentum he needed for the best 
arab battlefield performance ever against israel 
it later was to give him the political leverage he needed to make 
peace 
as president mubarak quickly began work to recover egypts 
traditional position as political and military anchor of the arab 
world after the peace treaty most arab countries and the palestine 
liberation organization broke relations with egypt 
in june 1982 when king khaled of saudi arabia died mubarak 
quietly and unobtrusively went to pay egypts respects in 1983 he 
made up with the plo by giving sanctuary to chairman yasser arafat 
when invading israeli forces drove him from lebanon mubarak 
remained a staunch ally and major arms supplier of arab iraq in its 
long war with persian iran 
one by one arab barriers fell finally in november 1987 
leaders of the 22member arab league boycotting egypt en masse 
since 1979 voted that diplomatic relations are a matter of 
individual national interest 
since then all members except libya lebanon and syria have 
restored ties last week mubarak invited president hafez assad of 
syria to visit egypt and syrian media has begun hinting at a 
warming of relations 
in an interview shortly after sadat selected him vice president 
mubarak hinted at the kind of president he would be 
i am a man who likes to do his work perfectly and faithfully 
he told the cairo newspaper alakhbar 
he characterized his decisionmaking style in a 1986 interview 
with the associated press its wellstudied wellcalculated 
then the decision i never do anything just for the move no i 
am not that kind of man

epicenter just as the boy was born knocking him out of the 
obstetricians hands and leaving the exhausted new mother to pick 
him up 
the communist party newspaper pravda reported monday that moscow 
is cracking down on party leaders in neighboring azerbaijan who 
failed to cool flaming tempers and ethnic violence which led tens 
of thousands of armenians to flee azerbaijan in the weeks before the 
quake an undetermined number of refugees settled in with relatives 
in the quake area just before the earthquake struck

disciplined for failing to ease tension pravda said thirteen were 
expelled from the party in another group 121 persons held 
responsible were fired from their jobs

for inciting the ethnic strife as a coverup for their activities

the leader of an antiabortion organization monday 
denounced the setting of fires at three clinics on christmas morning 
i think if it was in fact people doing this in the name of 
right to life theyve done our movement no favors at all said 
bill price head of the texas coalition for life and president of 
the greater dallas right ot life committee we just do not in any 
form or fashion condone this type of activity 
a to z womens health services the fairmont center and the north 
dallas womens clinic sustained minor damage in the fires which 
were reported early sunday within about a half hour investigators 
said no injuries were reported 
clinic officials charged the attacks are the work of 
antiabortion groups which have staged protests and baby 
rescues at the clinics in the past year 
they are definitely suspicious fires said fire capt mike 
southerland its possible some flammable liquids were used but i 
dont know what types at this time 
the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms also is 
investigating for links to past attacks on abortion clinics 
i think all these fires were definitely connected said dena 
jackson director of operations at north dallas womens clinic 
when you look at the people that are antichoice they tend to be 
highly religious and with christmas day being so significant i 
think that definitely had something to do with it also 
we feel like we know who it is agreed betty pettigrew 
director of a to z womens health services theyre always 
threatening it and we had heard that some clinic was going to be 
hit not necessarily in dallas 
price said the fires improperly move the focus of the 
righttolife cause away from its goal and place it on the arson 
controversy

to 240 police also announced the arrest of a local man following a 
report of looting at a crash site 
at least 29 bodies are still missing from the 258 people who died 
aboard the new yorkbound boeing 747 steady rains throughout most 
of the day and low clouds restricted the search newall said 
there may be some we will not find and i think everyone should 
be aware of that newall said 
police spokesman angus kennedy said monday that all the occupants 
of four cars found near one crash site had been found alive eleven 
townspeople are missing and feared dead 
ms russellsmith refused to say any more about the suitcase nor 
would she describe the amount of wreckage submitted for analysis or 
what part of the aircraft it came from 
although because of the fragmented and scattered nature of the 
wreckage the investigation of the structural aspects of the accident 
is a slow process no evidence of a structural failure has so far 
been found charles said in a statement released in lockerbie and 
in london by the department of transport 
however the possibility of such a failure is still being 
actively investigated charles said some pieces of wreckage and 
a suitcase are today being taken to the royal armament research and 
development establishment at fort halstead in kent for more detailed 
examination to determine whether they exhibit evidence of a 
preimpact explosion 
the defense department said the center does research on 
explosives and armor 
experts have said structural failure or a bomb are the most 
likely reasons the pan am jet disappeared from radar screens just as 
it reached cruising altitude of 31000 feet over southwestern 
scotland 
the times of london quoted william tench former chief inspector 
of air accidents as saying he believed a structural failure caused 
the crash 
the flight originated as a boeing 727 from frankfurt west 
germany with a change of planes at londons heathrow international 
airport federal police in west germany and the commander of 
scotland yards antiterrorist squad last week began investigations 
at those airports 
newall said he believed the looting case was an isolated 
incident it occurred in the area where falling wreckage exploded in 
a fireball obliterating four houses and severely damaging 20 
others all the missing townspeople were residents of the 
neighborhood 
the rev patrick keegans the roman catholic parish priest lost 
his home in that neighborhood although he was away from it at the 
time 
at a requiem mass monday night keegans spoke of the bewilderment 
of those who lost loved ones 
confronted with the horror of such loss we feel empty hurt 
confused and we say to ourselves things will never be the same 
again as christ did on the cross we too scream at the father my 
god my god why have you abandoned me he does not seem to answer 
there is only silence 
britains independent television network canceled plans to cover 
the mass after kennedy said several relatives of the dead indicated 
they would not attend a televised service at least 90 relatives 
mostly from the united states are known to have visited the town 
since the crash 
lockerbies streets were quiet and its shops were closed monday 
for boxing day a holiday in britains long christmas break 
social workers expressed concern about the delayed effects of the 
disaster on the towns 2500 residents 
leslie jardine a spokesman for the local social work department 
said a brochure advertising a telephone hotline was being 
distributed to every home

brochure said stopping these feelings may lead to nervous and 
physical problems crying gives relief

the slayings of six women in recent 
months have diverted attention from another killer that has stalked 
this seaport for more than two years highpurity heroin 
city medical examiner dr john otoole iii estimated he handles 
between 30 and 40 overdose deaths per year in the greater new 
bedford area 
when i first joined the force youd see heroin 5 10 percent 
pure now its 50 to 60 percent pure said detective richard 
spirlet 
the potent heroin bearing labels like supra 87 and power 95 has 
drawn far less attention than the unknown killer responsible for the 
slayings of six women whose bodies were found along highways in this 
part of massachusetts 
when mayor john bullard was asked about the impact of the 
slayings on the community he spoke not of the fear of murder but of 
the scourge of drug addiction in this city of 98000 about 50 miles 
south of boston 
the biggest problem is the waste of human lives that takes 
place off the front pages bullard said law enforcement 
authorities said is no accident that the one thing all the murder 
victims had in common was drug abuse 
new bedford home of the states largest methadone program has 
become a bustling retail outlet for heroin coming in by car from new 
york city and providence ri 
a large colombian population in nearby central falls ri has 
kept new bedford well stocked in cocaine according to law 
enforcement officials 
in august september and october the city emergency medical 
services were responding to 17 overdose calls a month in november 
when the discovery of the bodies became a major news story there 
were 29 ambulance runs for overdoses 
i think the reason they overdose is they really dont know what 
theyre getting said kenneth sylvia deputy director of the 
emergency medical services unit a person is immune to a certain 
percentage of heroin if they go over that they overdose and i know 
that because i had a sister who overdosed and died 
new bedford boasts the nations richest fishing port in the 
dollar value of its catch but has higherthanaverage unemployment

the electoral court confirmed on 
monday that enough uruguayans signed petitions opposing a december 
1986 military amnesty law to force a referendum that could overturn 
it 
the referendum probably will be held in april said juan furest 
one of the nine members of the court the exact date will be 
disclosed within 10 days 
foes of the amnesty law needed 555701 signatures representing 
onequarter of uruguays 22 million electorate to obtain a 
referendum and furest said they obtained the required number 
the amnesty law bars the prosecution of soldiers and police 
accused of human rights abuses including murder committed during 
the 197385 military dictatorships suppression of urban terrorism 
local human rights groups said about 150 uruguayans were killed 
200 were arrested and disappeared and thousands were tortured in 
this small south american nation of 3 million people 
president julio m sanguinetti opposes the referendum and 
predicts the amnesty law will not be overturned he says overturning 
the law carries the likelihood of a long hazardous and 
dramatic period of confrontation between soldiers and civilians 
the law was passed as civil courts were about call military 
officers to answer charges of murder kidnapping and torture 
officers indicated they would ignore requests to testify setting up 
a potential clash with the government 
the same issue in argentina has led to three unsuccessful 
military insurrections there in the past 20 months against the 
government of president raul alfonsin 
sanguinetti elected in november 1984 took office in march 1985

prime minister yitzhak shamir may ask the united 
states and the soviet union to sponsor middle east peace talks as 
part of his new peace initiative an aide said monday 
shamirs proposal confirmed by his spokesman yossi ahimeir 
came as egypts president hosni mubarak was reported to be 
considering a trip to israel to advance stalemated peace efforts 
in beeville texas presidentelect bush expressed support monday 
for a meeting between egyptian and israeli leaders saying the 
more contact they have the better it is he said in response 
to a question he too would be willing to go to the middle east if 
he believed it would further the peace process 
ahimeir said in a telephone interview that shamir would condition 
his proposal on moscows renewing diplomatic ties the kremlin 
severed ties with israel during the 1967 middle east war when 
israel captured arab lands 
mubarak was quoted in an interview with a kuwaiti newspaper 
sunday as saying he would go to israel if the visit would help 
achieve peace it would be the first visit to the jewish state by an 
arab leader since the late egyptian president anwar sadat made his 
last trip in september 1979 
shamir has said he would welcome a visit by mubarak 
he would like to renew the link with mubarak ahimeir said 
adding that the timing seemed right since shamir as leader of the 
rightwing likud bloc took office for a second straight term 
thursday 
the likud virtually has complete control over the nations 
foreign policy although the leftleaning labor party is still in 
the government labors leader shimon peres formerly foreign 
minister is now finance minister 
israels ambassador in cairo shimon shamir was meeting with 
egyptian officials to determine whether a mubarak visit was 
possible said another shamir spokesman avi pazner 
thomas pickering the outgoing us ambassador to israel who has 
been named us ambassador to the united nations told reporters in 
tel aviv a shamirmubarak summit was certainly something the us 
would encourage and welcome 
he said the united states also was encouraged by israeli efforts 
to come up with a new peace initiative despite its fierce opposition 
to recent us contacts with the palestine liberation organization 
shamir has been drawing up his own peace plans as alternatives to 
growing pressure on israel to negotiate with the plo and participate 
in a proposed international middle east peace conference 
israel rejects any dialogue with the plo which it considers a 
terrorist group shamir also has refused calls to join an 
international conference fearing a wide forum of nations would be 
biased against israel and pressure it to concede land to the arabs 
ahimeir said that according to shamirs proposal the two 
superpowers would invite the parties of the conflict to sit down 
and negotiate without the participation of other un security 
council members 
the daily newspaper maariv said monday that in talks with 
mubarak shamir would propose an egyptian role in getting 
negotiations started between israel and a delegation made up of 
palestinians and representatives from neighboring jordan 
the aim of such talks would be to reach an interim agreement for 
palestinian selfrule in the occupied west bank and gaza strip the 
newspaper said 
ahimeir said shamir would be willing to coax jordan into peace 
talks by agreeing to consider modifications of the ussponsored 
camp david accords signed in 1978 which led to an israeliegyptian 
peace treaty the following year 
we want to get the jordanians into the peace circle we will 
start with camp david and are ready to discuss any changes they 
want we will listen and discuss it with them ahimeir said he 
declined to elaborate 
both jordan and the plo have in the past rejected the camp david 
accords which outline a fiveyear autonomy or selfrule plan for 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip pending negotiations 
for a final settlement 
although israel wants jordan to be a peace partner king hussein 
distanced himself from that role in july when he severed his ties 
with the west bank 
palestinians in the occupied lands have been protesting israel 
rule there for more than a year in what has been called the 
intefadeh or uprising on monday soldiers shot and wounded 
eight palestinians in scattered clashes in the territories 
at least 336 palestinians and 14 israelis have died since the 
uprising began dec 8 1987

authorities on monday denied anew any 
knowledge of how five inmates died after they were videotaped while 
in police custody during a prison riot that killed 25 people 
i cannot explain this to you no no we have no information on 
the matter francisco flores a spokesman for the nayarit state 
government said in a telephone interview 
the five inmates were captured during an assault friday night by 
special police commando teams the fox and scorpion squads that 
quelled a twoday uprising at the venustiano carranza state 
penitentiary 500 miles northwest of mexico city 
freed hostage patricia castillo a clerk in the prison law 
office said monday the fox squad entered the prison shooting 
indiscriminately the squad was very angry because they the 
inmates had killed their commander i was very scared 
she was among about 19 hostages seized thursday by a small group 
of inmates to protest the denial of christmas pardons for good 
behavior 
officials at first said the inmates died during two assaults on 
the prison but according to a witness and two hostages and a 
videotape made by nbc news only one assault occurred and many 
prisoners were still alive when it was over 
some prisoners bodies had up to 10 bullet wounds the government 
news agency notimex said 
among those who died before the assault were the prison warden 
samuel alvarado and jorge armando duarte badillo the fox squad 
commander who officials said was killed while trying to negotiate 
with the inmates 
one witness who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
prisoners captured after the assault were questioned in a park 
outside the prison then taken back inside members of the fox team 
also entered the prison and more than 30 gunshots were heard after 
that 
the governor of nayarit celso humberto delgado ramirez said in 
a television interview sunday that only one assault occurred but 
did not discuss the attack further delgado was in mexico city on 
monday but could not be located for comment 
the fox and scorpion teams are based in mexico city but fernando 
arias a spokesman for the federal attorney generals office said 
on monday the prison uprising was a state matter 
it has been completely in the hands of the state government 
and we are not investigating or taking part because legally there is 
no reason to arias said the two teams were sent by the federal 
district government on loan to and under the orders of nayarit 
officials said 21 inmates died during the assault but the nbc 
videotape showed 13 prisoners lying outside the prison being 
questioned by police all were alive although at least two appeared 
to have suffered bloody wounds 
five prisoners could be heard giving their complete names 
benjamin gambero anzaldo jose luis parra leyva arturo torres

director of criminal investigations for the state 
castillo said she was held by four inmates in a room and that one 
of them jose martinez palafox was captured alive his name also is 
on the list of the dead 
we were rescued by a special team the fox i believe it was 
called there was quite a bit of shooting they killed all the 
inmates there except one castillo said palafox surrendered she 
said he was not wounded but they killed him anyway 
castillo said she was treated well when first she was taken 
hostage but later they started pushing and shoving and 
mistreating us 
she criticized the governor for calling in the special police 
squads 
they came in and shoved everyone aside including the local 
police the judicial police or even the local army could have 
handled it she said

a similar story they surrendered she said only one prisoner 
was in the room with her and about a dozen other hostages and that 
prisoner walked out with his hands raised she said

passengers on a plane that was forced to 
land when the fuselage tore open at 31000 feet monday said that 
although the experience was frightening there wasnt mass panic 
the crew was marvelous said lucille lobene 63 a passenger 
from north miami beach fla there was no screaming no hysteria 
the passengers were absolutely superb added the planes 
copilot garland jones 40 who is based in new york 
eastern airlines flight 251 a boeing 727 en route to atlanta 
from rochester ny made an emergency landing at yeager airport 
after a crack toward the rear of the plane began opening officials 
said two minor injuries were reported 
the jet carrying 104 passengers and six crew members lost cabin 
pressure but experienced no other sudden trouble said federal 
aviation administration spokesman jack barker in atlanta the 
opening in the fuselage was about a 14inch square hole barker 
said 
when you felt cold air right away you knew the outside was 
coming in said elaine davie 40 a passenger from rochester ny 
davie said none of her childrens oxygen masks worked and her 
5yearold daughter christina began screaming 
she was just too young to understand what was going on and we 
couldnt get to her right away she said 
jones said he suspects the masks didnt work because passengers 
didnt pull them all the way down the oxygen flow is triggered by 
the pulling action he said 
another passenger david moore 39 of phoenix ariz said he 
was concerned about an unusual noise before takeoff 
there was a definite wind noise not from the back of the plane 
but from above our heads said moore the second officer came 
back looked at it and decided it wasnt anything 
but jones disputed moores account and said the second officer 
went to the rear of the plane to help flight attendants close the 
aft door prior to takeoff 
when the hole broke open i looked up and i could see sunlight 
shining through moore said 
passenger sam piazza 55 a former pilot of boca raton fla 
said he and his wife at first thought a bomb had exploded we were 
cruising along and you could hear the rush of the wind and the pitch 
of the wind and all of a sudden you could hear a big pop he said 
piazza said the noise from the wind obscured the crews attempts 
to talk to passengers over the flight intercom

investigators were trying to 
determine monday what caused an 18car passenger train to jump the 
tracks stranding nearly 300 holiday travelers overnight but 
injuring no one amtrak said monday 
the passengers aboard the california zephyr remained on the 
train which still had light and heat for several hours until a 
work train monday brought them here in two trips aboard seven 
cabooses 
we know what happened not why it happened said john 
jacobsen amtrak director of public relations in washington dc 
jacobsen said some of the wheels slipped between the rails 
causing the cars to go off the tracks 
the wheels dropped down between the rails and thats what kept 
it upright he said the train couldnt move because it was 
locked into place by the rail 
but he emphasized i dont know whether there was a problem 
with the rail and added that any number of things could have 
caused the accident 
thats all under investigation he said 
rick davis amtrak liaison for the denver amp rio grande railroad 
which maintains the track said it was premature to say what caused 
the derailment 
jerry pilcher of chicago said passengers took the derailment in 
stride in part because the train already was several hours behind 
schedule there was a bit of caroling it couldnt have gone more 
smoothly if it had been a drill said pilcher 
the train carrying 294 passengers and about 15 crew members 
originated in chicago and was headed for the west coast it was 150 
miles west of denver and 10 miles east of here when it left the 
tracks sunday night 
it was snowing heavily at the time and about a foot of snow was 
on the ground but that shouldnt have had any bearing on the track 
jacobsen said 
some passengers compared the derailment to a rough airplane 
landing or driving over cobblestones 
it was a miracle no one got hurt said wardell copeland of 
vallejo calif it was amazing that none of the cars went off into 
the colorado river about 15 feet and that would have been it 
i was asleep and all at once i thought we were going over a 
bridge said carolyn johnson of lincoln neb it just got real 
rough and the train stopped 
up to 40 denver amp rio grande maintenance crew members worked on 
the grounded train monday trying to get it back on the track but 
said it could take until tuesday the railroad maintains the track 
on which the zephyr was traveling 
most passengers took buses to salt lake city or back to denver 
jacobsen said the damage to the train was probably minor 
an amtrak derailment in colorado in 1985 sent 26 people to the 
hospital seven cars left the track in a canyon near granby 
northwest of denver

an eastern airlines jet carrying 110 
people tore open at 31000 feet monday causing the airliner to lose 
cabin pressure and forcing an emergency landing authorities said 
two minor injuries were reported 
a federal aviation administration official said cracks were found 
on the same planes fuselage in two previous inspections 
bobbie mardis of the faas safety data branch in oklahoma city 
also said mechanical problems forced the aircraft to make 
unscheduled landings on two occasions since 1985 
the boeing 727 en route to atlanta from rochester ny landed 
at yeager airport with a hole in the fuselage that opened up 50 
miles or a few minutes flying time north of charleston officials 
said 
the jet carrying 104 passengers and six crew members lost cabin 
pressure but experienced no other sudden trouble said federal 
aviation administration spokesman jack barker in atlanta 
the opening in the fuselage was about a 14inch square hole 
barker said those things start with a crack and end up as a 
hole 
there was no immediate indication of the cause of the tear near 
the top of the jet which was about 20 years old barker said 
the passengers put on their oxygen masks and the pilot flew the 
jet to 10000 feet an altitude that requires no pressurization 
barker said 
two passengers were taken to the charleston area medical center 
for treatment of minor injuries a hospital spokesman said 
they are being treated for injuries as a result of the 
decompression nose bleeds headaches that sort of thing said 
spokesman gary chernenko 
passengers described the sudden blast of air that whipped through 
the craft when the hole blew open 
when you felt cold air right away you knew the outside was 
coming in said elaine davie 40 a passenger from rochester ny 
her ears still ached after popping when the plane quickly descended 
she said 
passenger sam piazza 55 of boca raton fla said he and his 
wife at first thought a bomb had exploded we were cruising along 
and you could hear the rush of the wind and the pitch of the wind 
and all of a sudden you could hear a big pop he said 
another passenger david moore 39 of phoenix ariz said he 
was concerned about an unusual noise before takeoff 
there was a definite wind noise not from the back of the plane 
but from above our heads said moore the second officer came 
back looked at it and decided it wasnt anything 
but copilot garland jones 40 disputed moores account and said 
the second officer went to the rear of the plane to help flight 
attendants close the aft door prior to takeoff 
when the hole broke open i looked up and i could see sunlight 
shining through moore said 
the roof of a 19yearold boeing 737 tore off an aloha airlines 
flight at 24000 feet on april 28 killing one person and injuring 
61 the accident was blamed on cracks in the fuselage skin from 
repeated pressurization and depressurization of the cabin 
that accident prompted a federal investigation into the aging 
fleet of jets and the faa ordered airlines to replace rivets 
believed to have caused cracks 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak in miami said the eastern jet 
has always been owned by eastern was delivered to the company in 
the late 1960s and was maintained according to faa guidelines it 
had an inspection of the crown in september thats the whole top 
area from the cockpit to the tail she said 
we dont know what he cause is yet weve dispatched a team of 
mechanics to charleston she said 
ms mardis said a fracture 332 of an inch large was found in 
the jet during a 1987 safety inspection in atlanta and a 5inch 
crack was found in 1986 
she said one unscheduled landing was made when a hydraulic 
pressure system failed and the other when an engine compressor 
failed ms mardis did not say where the landings were made but 
said they were reported in 1985 and 1986 
we were just going along and they were serving the firstclass 
passengers and all of a sudden air started to rush by and it was 
kicking up dust said bill tretter 25 of buffalo ny who was 
traveling with three family members 
copilot jones said the air traffic controller and the passengers 
handled the situation well it was a very unusual occurrence but 
the procedure we practice all of the time jones said it went 
very well 
airport police chief robert barnette said the hole was 6 to 8 
inches wide on the left side of the aircraft near the tail 
it was a tear ms ceremsak said the metal did not 
actually leave the fuselage it was at the top of the fuselage 
right over the last rows of the aircraft 
barnette said he learned at 910 am of the planes request to 
land 
as far as i was concerned it was a normal landing said the 
air traffic controller who guided the plane in he spoke on 
condition of anonymity i asked if he needed assistance and he 
said no there was no emergency crews needed on the runway 
boeing commercial airplanes spokesman tom cole reached at home 
monday said he did not have the jets records in front of him but 
could not recall any serious structural problems with the 727 he 
said there have been cracks in some 727s over the years as with all 
jetliners but nothing unusual 
boeing co had shut down nearly all operations for the holiday 
after the incident is studied and it is determined how the tear 
occurred boeing will notify all operators of 727s of similar age 
and use to tell them all what we found out so they can check their 
airplanes cole said 
the threeengine jet went into commercial service in 1964 
production ended in 1984 with 1831 delivered according to a 
boeing inventory for the end of 1987 eastern had 122 727s in its 
fleet

committee says the possible presence of a cia operative on the pan

provoked a terrorist attack 
sen william cohen rmaine said sunday on abcs this week 
with david brinkley that he could not confirm whether the cia 
agent had been on the flight 
but cohen said that even if the agent had been aboard it would 
not necessarily be significant because terrorists could have 
eliminated him by direct assassination on the ground

tobacco has been accused of mischief ever since 
people first lit up but in the united states it wasnt until a

indictment was drawn up since then antismoking attitudes and 
campaigns have steadily gathered force and produced striking change

for the employers of the marlboro man and the vast majority of 
americans who found comfort and contemplation in smoke rings the 
warnings had been clear and the formal announcement of 1964 came as 
no big surprise 
twentyfive years ago next wednesday after 14 months of studying 
8000 scientific reports surgeon general luther terrys blueribbon 
panel announced that smoking was bad and a health hazard of 
sufficient importance in the united states to warrant appropriate 
remedial action 
statistically linked to lung cancer heart disease stroke and 
various malignancies of the throat and mouth smoking was called 
health enemy no 1 
remedial action began benignly enough warnings on cigarette 
packs that reminded the fatalistic smoker that he could be killing 
himself 
but in the ensuing years it has become a new kind of uncivil war 
which smokers see as a bullying campaign against individual rights 
and many nonsmokers see as a crusade in which their health and 
wellbeing is at stake not to mention their carpets and coffee 
tables that in years past were vulnerable to falling ash and embers 
back in 1964 at an accelerating yearly pace more than 70 
million adult americans in a population of 192 million smoked more 
than 523 billion cigarettes 71 billion cigars and used more than 
150 million pounds of tobacco in other forms a pipeful a chaw or a 
dip of snuff 
these days after 2 decades of warnings and repressions some 55 
million to 60 million americans smoke out of a population of some 
million they smoke 575 billion cigarettes a year some 4 billion of 
various types of cigars and cigarillos and they use a little less 
than 150 million pounds of tobacco in other forms 
they smoke less per capita today but spend a lot more for it 
most hotels and airports charge nearly 2 a pack and the price 
would make a world war ii smoker 18 cents a pack choke before he 
took a drag 
in 1964 smokers spent 8 billion on the ugly habit some 33 
billion of which went to federal state and local governments as 
taxes today they spend 355 billion on tobacco and almost 10 
billion is collected as tax 
all of this in the face of a nationwide campaign that has banned 
smoking in many federal buildings work places restaurants 
airplanes trains and rest rooms in terms of a regulation and 
educational programs the scale is unprecedented save for 
prohibition and the stated aims by health authorities are more 
ambitious than any attempt to persuade people to change such an 
ingrained habit 
three years ago surgeon general c everett koop announced he 
expected a smokefree society by the year 2000 
this is not a prohibitive society he said were not going 
to tell people they cant smoke we learned that we cant tell 
people they cant drink 
they can however devise tactics to isolate and then eliminate 
the habit 
smelling victory the surgeon general put on a smile and 
suggested that outdoor smoking be mandated in the spring and by 
the time cold weather comes it will be wellingrained in their 
habits and they wont come in to smoke 
backed by the whole grassroots movement of militant 
nonsmokers he said 
i think the person that smokes in 1995 is going to smoke alone 
or with other smokers that might be in his bathroom or his back 
yard or in a segregated area i wouldnt be surprised to see it out 
of doors 
even now the smoker can sense his growing isolation 
smokers have felt the elbow in their backs at their local 
formerly friendly bars and were asked to move the ashtray this is 
something like asking the altar boy to douse the incense in church 
the federal government finds itself on the horns of a dilemma it 
actually controls the growing of tobacco by allotting acreage to 
180000 farms in 23 states and puerto rico this stabilizes 
production and insures price levels the commodity credit corp 
lends farmers money against the value of their crops the loans 
being repaid as the tobacco is sold for many farms tobacco is the 
one stable factor in an otherwise unpredictable market consider 
wheat last year yielded 96 an acre soybeans yielded 183 
cotton 459 peanuts 632 feed corn 202 and sweet corn 724 
tobacco yielded 3206 per acre 
for many states it is a prime cash crop north carolina reaped 
738 million last year kentucky 514 million south carolina 151 
million and so on down the line to west virginia which reaped 4 
million 
the tobacco industry employs almost 57000 people who feed the 
product to just short of 1 million retail outlets that include 
almost 619000 vending machines 
the united states exports 34 billion worth of tobacco a year 
more than any other country and the figures grow every year 
so uncle sam condemns the weed hems in its users yet encourages 
its cultivation and its export 
antismoking forces the white hats while chastising the smoker 
for his foolish habit see him as the victim of sinister forces the 
black hats the tobacco industry 
lori heise writing in world watch a product of the worldwatch 
institute which tries to keep its fingers on the ills of the world 
lambastes what she calls the unhealthy alliance between 
government and the industry

she says tobacco remains legal today solely by historical 
accident and political maneuvering 
the accident is that millions of americans became addicted to 
tobacco before the hazards of smoking were widely recognized and 
before products sold to the public were systematically reviewed for 
safety the maneuvering involves skillful political manipulation by 
the tobacco industry to obtain exemption from every law and 
authority designed to protect the public from hazardous substances 
she says that with falling domestic demand the industry is 
aiming more at foreign markets especially the third world and asia 
where for instance 63 percent of men in japan smoke 70 percent in 
china only 27 percent of american men smoke she says 
furthermore american cigarettes sold abroad are far higher in 
tars and nicotine than domestic brands 
indeed those 25 years ago when the surgeon general first 
attacked smoking most smokers cut down and looked to the industry 
to provide them with safer cigarettes which the industry did 
opponents who had pressed for safer cigarettes then pressed for 
none at all 
the strength of the new attack on smoking has the fervor and the 
rationale of mothers against drunk drivers the national academy 
of sciences in 1986 legitimized studies that held that nonsmokers 
were endangered by environmental tobacco smoke called ets 
that same year the surgeon general said 20 years of accumulating 
evidence allowed the verdict it is now clear that disease risk 
due to the inhalation of tobacco smoke is not limited to the 
individual who is smoking but can extend to those who inhale 
tobacco smoke emitted into the air 
while urging changes he emphasized that those changes should 
not be designed to punish the smoker 
cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior and the individual 
smoker must decide whether or not to continue that behavior 
however it is evident from the data presented in this volume that 
the choice to smoke cannot interfere with the nonsmokers right to 
breathe air free of tobacco smoke 
while the studies have been criticized they are largely 
statistical and have not been refuted but since many smokers have a 
guilty conscience about their habit anyway efforts to fight off the 
increasing repression make little headway 
not that there have not been efforts philip morris publishes a 
glossy entertaining magazine that has become a rallying point for 
smokers militant enough to fight back introduced in 1985 with a 
circulation of 150000 the free magazine claims a circulation today 
of 12 million and a readership of 24 million 
it reports local and national efforts to restrict the rights of 
smokers and provides a vent for some of the emotions of those who 
feel they are persecuted by the nonsmoking movement 
publisher guy smith explains that its surveys produce a profile 
of the american smoker that should command attention in the 
marketplace 
we want detroit to know that smokers buy cars a lot of cars 
furthermore we want detroit to know that although some people 
complain about cars with ashtrays there are still millions of car 
owners who smoke and use ashtrays 
if the message is aimed at automakers it is also aimed at 
politicians restaurateurs and others who serve the general public 
consider the philip morris statistics smokers own 35 million 
cars 5 million of them new last year they have 38 million tv sets 
23 million vcrs 5 million home computers 30 million credit cards 
sixtyfive percent of them are married and 40 percent have children 
almost 90 percent are registered voters and the vast majority said 
they voted in the last election they are affluent educated active 
in community affairs and charitable organizations every day 21 
million of them go out to eat 
that does not jibe with the statistics of the nonsmoking 
movement which sees smoking as largely a bluecollar problem the 
affluent bettereducated having fled the smoking ranks 
everybodys statistics show the number of women who smoke is 
bucking an otherwise downward trend especially young women the 
nonsmoking people say this is especially disheartening because 
smoking by a pregnant woman has been shown to be injurious to the 
fetus 
some 35 million americans have quit most of them obeying the 
strictures of the american cancer society the american heart 
association the american medical association and myriad other 
health groups allied against smoking 
as a social experiment the campaign for a smokefree america has 
made remarkable strides but it is not the first attempt to stomp 
out the lowly weed 
they tried whipping in russia and beheading in turkey and in 
this country health issues were a prime motive in the late 1800s 
now its local bans on smoking as in new york city and beverly 
hills curtailed advertising and special taxes 35 cents more a pack 
in california 
todays antismoking movement is hardnosed and persistent 
thanks to federal involvement it is an emotional confrontation 
the new yorker magazine recently captured the angst in one of 
its cartoons the skyscrapers of manhattan rise majestically into 
the air but their turrets and parapets are occupied by halfhidden 
members of a swat team below huddled and hidden in the dark 
shadows of the buildings are two men the last cigarette smokers in 
new york city

with the surgeon general looking for a smokeless 
society a decade hence we asked two people on opposite sides of the 
issue to look into the question what would the world be like 
without smokers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
without cigarette smoking our nation would be free from the 
tragic toll of 320000 deaths a year thats equivalent to two 
fully loaded jumbo jets crashing every day with no survivors 
the current cure rate for cancer would rise to 55 percent to 60 
percent from its current level of 50 percent 
onethird of all beds in cancer centers would no longer be 
occupied by victims of smoking 
fewer of our young people would take up drugs since smoking 
teenagers are 15 times more likely to graduate to narcotics 
the air would be cleaner everywhere on planes in hotels 
sports arenas restaurants public buildings places of employment 
the movies and homes some 46000 deaths to nonsmokers would cease 
and our nation would no longer be paying out 65 billion annually 
for medical bills and lost productivity incurred by cigarette 
smoking 
the life expectancy gain for people who would have experienced a 
tobaccorelated death would be approximately 15 years 
families would no longer have to endure the loss of loved ones to 
cigarettes and children would no longer have to worry about the fate 
of their smoking parents 
public health and agricultural officials would no longer confront 
us with the paradox of on the one hand ordering warning statements 
on cigarette packs and the other providing subsidies for the growth 
of a lethal product 
funds now invested in research and treatment for smokinginduced 
illnesses could be diverted to new areas of promise in medicine and 
science 
the pack of lies the lady killers the coffin nails would be 
relics of our past the environment would become safer healthier 
and better for all 
one would hope that the marlboro cowboy could be rehabilitated to 
champion enlightened causes like say no to drugs stop drunk 
driving or perhaps encourage people to have annual checkups for 
cancer

paradise thats what the antitobacco zealots would call a world 
without tobacco wed say more a fools paradise 
if those opposed to tobacco were to succeed in dictating which 
behaviors were acceptable and which were not life would become very 
unpleasant for smokers and nonsmokers alike 
the sad fact is that once the antis eliminated free choice 
regardinq tobacco they would affect free choice itself the adult 
enjoyment of alcoholic beverages could be next on their hit list 
from there where what would the selfappointed moralists with 
their predictable selfserving claims ban next red meat eggs 
dairy products artificial sweeteners coffee would any product or 
behavior still be an object of free choice 
before we yield to such action it might be wise to reflect on 
what this country is all about the united states was founded by 
inspired curmudgeons who were wise enough to realize that in 
protecting others rights to disagree with them they were 
protecting their own right to disagree with others 
the constitution reflects this wisdom the founders saw the folly 
in having one person or group dictate the choices of another person 
or group it also protects the rights of nonsmokers 
from the beginning tobacco was part of american history it 
served as collateral for loans from france to finance the 
revolution and its value helped sustain the young nation all the 
while it was freely criticized in 1604 king james called it a 
loathsome custom the colonists and revolutionaries were 
chastised by moralists but continued to grow and enjoy tobacco as 
part of their free choice 
who are todays smokers the people whose choice would be usurped 
in a world without tobacco everybody there are nearly 60 million 
adults who choose to smoke part of the fabric of american society 
they raise families pay billions of dollars in tobacco taxes and 
have the same hopes and dreams as anyone else 
when a world without tobacco is promised as paradise do not 
forget that the price is loss of free choice and that is paradise 
lost

more than 680000 boat people have fled 
vietnam since saigon fell to the communists in 1975 and about 
615000 have been resettled most by the united states canada and 
australia but in recent years scaleddown resettlement programs 
have left thousands languishing in rude camps scores of others die 
each year in their flight for freedom

la kieu mai ly the 16yearold 
daughter of a rice farmer fled vietnam by boat seeking a better 
life expecting to eventually join an aunt in the united states 
five days into the voyage in may thai pirates in the south china 
sea rammed the boat drowning many of the 22 passengers they 
attacked those who tried to hang onto the boat to save themselves 
with long poles and knives 
the pirates abducted miss mai ly her sister her aunt and two 
other women they repeatedly raped the women during eight days of 
terror and then tossed miss mai ly into the sea she swam for hours 
before another boat rescued her her two relatives are still missing 
and presumed dead 
miss mai ly is now staying in this austere camp near the volatile 
cambodian border where thailand has sent vietnams boat people 
to discourage more from coming but she says she would never return 
home despite her ordeal at sea and the thai governments refusal to 
allow the boat people to resettle in the west 
i would commit suicide first she says as late monsoon rains 
muddy the floor of her bamboo and thatched roof hut 
the boat people continue fleeing vietnam more than 13 years after 
the communists defeated usbacked south vietnam in april 1975 but 
they are now sailing into a world increasingly reluctant to receive 
them 
more than 680000 boat people have fled since 1975 and about 
615000 have been resettled most by the united states canada and 
australia but in recent years scaleddown resettlement programs 
and increasingly restrictive selection have left thousands of 
longstayers languishing in the camps for years many with 
serious psychological problems 
in 1979 asian nations already sheltering more than 200000 boat 
people pushed tens of thousands from their shores killing many and 
threatened to shoot others but at a geneva conference in july of 
that year western nations pledged to resettle the refugees and 
asian nations promised to give them safe asylum 
that led to a recent surge in the exodus the refugees from 
vietnam now include not only those fleeing political persecution 
but also economic migrants and people seeking to join relatives 
abroad 
in 1988 scores of vietnamese drowned as authorities pushed their 
small wooden boats off thailand some were beaten in dreary hong 
kong camps others were left to drift and die at sea 
the western nations are tired of dealing with the problem and 
perceive themselves as no longer able to sustain the guarantees they 
made in 1979 says one senior western aid official 
in a recent series of urgent consultations nations have agreed 
to another international conference early in 1989 but this time to 
forge a strategy to deter rather than ease the exodus 
there is some cause for optimism vietnam for the first time says 
it will take back large groups of boat people previously vietnam 
branded them as traitors and allowed only a few to return 
vietnam reached a repatriation accord with hong kong in october 
and seeks agreements with malaysia and thailand in early november 
a vietnamese delegation visited a camp in malaysia to persuade boat 
people they were welcome back home but a major problem is that 
hanoi wants only those who volunteer to return while its neighbors 
want to send back anyone who is not a political refugee 
of the 60000 boat people in the regions camps only about a 
dozen have volunteered to return to vietnam says sergio vieira de 
mello head of the asia bureau of the united nations high 
commissioner for refugees 
in hong kong however 439 vietnamese have volunteered to return 
home vietnam pledged they would face no recrimination and britain 
which rules hong kong has promised financial aid to help them 
resettle 
we hope that a successful reintegration of those would break 13 
years of assumptions that once they leave vietnam their 
resettlement in third countries is automatic that the eden is there 
and theyve got to give it a try vieira de mello said in an 
interview in bangkok 
after subsiding for a few years 28116 boat people arrived in 
neighboring countries in 1987 the largest annual flow since 1982 
and camp populations swelled in the first nine months of 1988 
37676 vietnamese landed double the number of the same period in 
1987 
that overtaxed the patience of asias developing nations 
resulting in the most serious asylum crisis in years 
thai marine police and fishermen pushed off or rammed boats that 
arrived on the east coast in a massive smuggling network involving 
corrupt thai cambodian and vietnamese officials western aid 
officials said at least 100 boat people drowned and others were 
attacked by pirates after being turned away hundreds of others were 
stranded on islands with no regular source of food or water 
government officials called the boat people invading economic 
opportunists who posed major security problems 
thailand halted resettlement abroad and sent all new boat people 
to this camp in the nervous nomans land of the thaicambodian 
frontier alongside some 300000 cambodians huddled on the doorstep 
of the decadeold war in their country

thailand in april announced restoration of asylum but sources 
say the pushoffs continue 
asylum across the board is pretty much over in thailand says 
a senior western aid official 
tiny crowded hong kong in june ended one of the regions most 
generous asylum programs and began screening new arrivals to 
separate political refugees from economic migrants who are to be 
repatriated officials said that instead of the ethnic chinese from 
the bourgeois class the communists once persecuted most new boat 
people were peasants difficult to resettle abroad 
guards at hei ling chau center used their feet fists and batons 
to beat vietnamese on june 19 when they went on a hunger strike 
after complaining they were not getting enough food the medical 
staff examined 100 vietnamese in 45 minutes 
more than 4000 other vietnamese were crammed into the top floors 
of a 12story factory building which un officials likened to a 
prison unfit for human habitation wooden barriers on the windows 
shut out sunlight and there was one restroom for 600 people 
authorities later decided to close the camp 
community groups strongly protested when the government said it 
would abandon the system of closed camps where vietnamese cannot go 
outside without special permission in one public opinion poll 73 
percent of hong kong residents surveyed opposed allowing the boat 
people to land 
malaysia said it was fed up with boat arrivals and threatened to 
close its pulau bidong camp housing more than 10000 boat people by 
the end of 1989 officials warned the country would begin turning 
away boats from its shores 
a us navy ship the uss dubuque abandoned a drifting 
ramshackle boat of vietnamese in the south china sea in june and 
some starving passengers said they later murdered and ate two boys 
on board fiftytwo passengers survived 37 days at sea but 58 died 
the commander of the dubuque capt alexander g balian has been 
relieved of duty 
moreover pirate attacks have become much more savage compared 
with the same period last year the number of vietnamese reported 
dead or missing in attacks in the first nine months of this year 
soared from 21 to 428 and those raped or abducted from 61 to 142 
these tragedies have posed a dilemma how do you preserve the 
right of asylum without encouraging more people to flee 
nations attending talks in bangkok this fall urged a package of 
measures including repatriation and renewed pledges of asylum and 
resettlement based on regionwide screening like that in hong kong 
the united states has quietly expressed support for involuntary 
repatriation of economic migrants under certain conditions in other 
major policy shifts it has proposed a moratorium on resettlement 
and narrowing its program to vietnamese who qualify as immigrants or 
are of special humanitarian concern such as people held in 
political reeducation camps because of their us ties during 
the war 
weve always had a resettlementdriven policy but there is a 
growing awareness that resettlement has a negative impact by 
encouraging the boat exodus says a us embassy official 
in a recent interview in hanoi assistant foreign minister vu 
khoan said vietnam was trying to discourage the boat exodus by 
expanding the orderly departure program for people to leave on 
regular jet flights and the resettlement in the united states of 
halfamerican children and former reeducation inmates vietnam also 
now allows people to travel abroad to visit relatives or for work 
study and medical care he said 
western sources say vietnam also has increased border patrols 
clamped down on boat people smugglers and mounted a public awareness 
campaign to discourage flight 
the orderly departure program has expanded and the 2221 
resettled in the united states in september was a record high month 
the united states has taken half of the more than 145000 vietnamese 
resettled since the program began in 1979 and has applications from 
700000 others but establishing a special program for former 
inmates remains stalled by political differences with vietnam 
sixtytwo percent of some 2300 vietnamese who landed in thailand 
in the first half of this year told aid officials they or their 
relatives had spent time in reeducation 
economic policies are the main weapon the communists use to 
govern the country says nguyen huu giao a former lawyer who is 
the vietnamese administrator at ban thad they cannot control the 
population without trying to control their stomachs 
giao 49 says he spent 10 years in reeducation after speaking 
out for human rights he paid a smuggler about 2500 worth of gold 
to flee the country shortly after his release in october 1987 
he says he would never go back and like many others at ban thad 
is convinced that someday he will be granted his wish to start a new 
life in the west 
i dont think thailand will keep us here all our lives he 
says i will wait as long as they want

editors note in the years just following world war i more 
player pianos were sold than standard pianos but that soon ended on 
a sour note thanks to the coming of the radio and the phonograph 
now the ole piano roll is rolling again thanks to a music merchant 
in pennsylvania with an ear for nostalgia 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
ed keefer like the girl in a cartoon from 
another era has a good foot for music 
at his classic player piano co housed in a nondescript 
building at the end of a dirt road the worlds great compositions 
are performed with no sour notes no missed trills and no botched 
arpeggios 
im elementary i play about three four or five songs and 
thats about it keefer says thats why players are so great i 
enjoy footpumping them and sitting there singing along 
keefer 33 founded his cottage company two years ago when he 
discovered that the last firm manufacturing player pianos had gone 
out of business a music store owner for 12 years he always had a 
steady trickle of customers for the mechanical pianos even in this 
remote part of northern pennsylvania and figured there were 
potential buyers in other parts of the country as well 
in a small town like seneca i was selling two players a year 
and figured someone in la ought to be able to sell 100 he says 
keefer sold his music store mortgaged his home and went into 
business in 1986 by 1987 the first full year of production sales 
reached 15 million he estimated sales would top 23 million in 
1989 when all the figures are in 
when we first went into production we were happy if we could 
finish one piano a day says todd hart 28 unofficial business 
manager now were building five a day the growth in two years is 
staggering 
things have been so busy no one has even bothered to take the 
time to paint the walls or put up a sign 
hart watches the bottom line while keefer usually spends his 
days poring over the operation of a new piece of equipment or going 
over various phases of production dressed in a flannel shirt and 
jeans the boss is indistinguishable from his carpenters and 
technicians 
although players comprise less than 1 percent of the overall 
piano industry keefer says classic has no competition it is the 
only company in the world manufacturing players regularly he says 
the company first began building a line of players under its own 
name but production quickly increased when it received orders to 
manufacture several hundred players for baldwin sales were enhanced 
this year when classic received additional orders from wurlitzer 
which was acquired by baldwin 
we have our own little niche in the industry keefer says 
baldwin sells 50000 regular pianos a year theyll sell about 
400 players it isnt worth it for them to gear up production to 
increase their volume 1 percent 
a few years ago the last companies to make player pianos 
aeolian which wurlitzer acquired and universal went out of 
business for reasons unrelated to the instrument itself hart says 
aeolian was a financially troubled company that had spread itself 
too thin by building all types of pianos including players under 
many different names hart says 
universal on the other hand had a good product in its 
stateoftheart player mechanisms which were inserted into another 
companys piano but the piano supplier went out of business and 
universal was up a creek without a piano hart says 
a player piano is composed of about 12000 parts compared to 
8000 in a regular piano like a regular piano depressing a piano 
key causes a wooden feltcovered peg called a hammer to strike 
a string in a player however the keys are depressed through 
pneumatics 
a paper roll punched with holes passes over a brass bar which 
maintains a constant vacuum either by pumping the foot pedals or by 
turning on an electric switch when a hole in the paper roll passes 
over the vacuum it causes a valve to close and depress the piano 
key 
the greater the number of holes passing over the vacuum bar at 
the same time the greater the number of keys played which is why a 
player can do what a human cannot 
customers for player pianos are often people in their 40s and 50s 
who have long nurtured an interest in the instruments he says with 
retail prices ranging from about 6800 to nearly 9000 theyre 
usually not bought on a whim 
younger people are buying regular pianos and those who are 
older than their 50s are just remembering and wishing he says 
obviously its enough of a novelty item and theres enough of a 
price difference between this and a regular acoustic piano that its 
not a question of gee do we buy a regular piano or do we buy a 
player its when can we afford a player ive always wanted 
one 
despite their nostalgic appeal players are not just for the 
perry como set piano rolls which currently cost about 5 each 
have been manufactured continuously since the 1890s in music styles 
from the silly to the sublime from scott joplin to janis joplin 
ragtime to rock n roll

the two companies currently manufacturing piano rolls love 
me keefer says they were very supportive when we first started 
because for a time they were without player pianos and therefore 
without an end product for their product 
time was however when player pianos were as common as video 
games and stereo systems are now when players burst onto the scene 
in the late 19th century years of piano lessons became academic to 
many a wouldbe pianist with too little patience or coordination to 
learn to play 
until the mid1920s the question was not whether to buy a player 
but which player to buy says harvey roehl whose vestal press has 
published dozens of books on the subject 
just before world war i there were more than 40 companies in the 
player business and from 1919 to 1925 more players were sold than 
standard pianos according to us department of commerce figures 
famous composers such as george gershwin edvard grieg and claude 
debussy were hired to transcribe their music on piano rolls in the 
early days of ragtime many tunes that never made it to a printed 
score survived only on piano rolls 
the player was so popular it often usurped regular pianos roehl 
claims the decline in sales of regular pianos in the 1930s and 40s 
was partly because a whole generation of children simply had not 
learned to play the piano 
in one particular cartoon from the era a young girl arms at her 
side pumps the pedals of a player while her welldressed mother 
remarks to a friend yes my daughter has a great foot for music 
when player pianos were in their infancy they were a real 
novelty hart says even if it was a lousy playing piano it 
would sell because it was a player if you had a player piano in 
your house it was a bigtime party house it was the place to go on 
a friday night 
but the end came even more quickly than the beginning thanks to 
the 1929 stock market crash and the birth of radio and phonographs 
in 1932 not a single player was shipped from the factories roehl 
says 
since the late 1950s however interest in players has been 
growing and production was renewed albeit randomly 
in a sense its nostalgia for a lot of people hart says 
it gives people a sense of their roots aunt gertrude had one in 
the parlor grandpa had one in the basement whatever 
as hart spoke the rich chords and runs of the shadow of your 
smile wafted through the air from a corner of the warehousestyle 
building where the players are given one final test before being 
shipped 
hes good isnt he quips hart glancing at a motionless 
darkhaired man listening for imperfections in a wurlitzer 
actually few of the four dozen employees at classic play the 
piano and no one not even the boss owns a player 
our kids are too little yet theyd pound on it says keefer 
i cant afford one jokes hart 
it takes classic 58 hours to build a player from assembling the 
player mechanisms and building the oakveneered cabinet to winding 
the strings around tuning pens and handgluing parachutetype fabric 
to small plastic bellows that operate each key 
fortyseven people are involved in the process 41 more than 
when the company began that makes keefer and hart very happy for 
its one of the few bright lights in the economically depressed 
area which is largely dependent on the oil and gas industry 
jobs were one of eds concerns there were a lot of people who 
needed jobs a lot of his friends and family who were out of work 
says hart whose brother does the stainedglass designs for the 
pianos sliding doors 
as he spoke a piano teacher and a dozen of her students on an 
informal tour of the small plant walked by quietly commenting on 
the quality of the sound and the action of the keys 
we like showing off no problem hart says in this area 
its exciting for people to see something thats succeeding

editors note its long been suspected that professional 
wrestlers are merely actors though theyd never admit it and now 
some of them are taking their talents to hollywood some are getting 
good reviews such as andre the giant in princess bride but 
others are proving in the words of one reviewer that wrestlers 
cant act a lick 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the world of acting there are the blue 
bloods sir john gielgud lord olivier 
enter king kong bundy 
gielgud and olivier work on hamlet bundy works on hulk hogans 
head 
ok so its not the royal academy of dramatic art but bundy a 
450pound balddomed professional wrestler is getting his share of 
casting calls 
bundy and a growing number of his fellow grapplers have gone 
hollywood 
if you think about it it makes a lot of sense in the right 
environment says myrna gardner a world wrestling federation 
marketing director theyre very experienced great in front of 
the cameras 
producers and directors evidently agree 
grapplers big andre the giant 7foot4 in the princess 
bride and small the haiti kid a midget in penitentiary 
iii currently are available on the shelves of video stores bundy 
has appeared with richard pryor in the film moving and appeared 
as a guest on the fox network show married with children 
jesse the body ventura has enjoyed prime roles in the arnold 
schwarzenegger boxoffice smashes predator and the running 
man superstar billy graham has a film due soon tiger chung lee 
worked on eddie murphys the golden child big john studd 
appeared in 1984s micki and maude and on shows like the 
ateam and beauty and the beast rowdy roddy pipers third 
film is john carpenters they live 
and next year hogan perhaps americas bestknown professional 
wrestler the force behind hulkamania a man whose likeness can 
be found on more gift items than elvis presley will star in no 
holds barred 
the hulkster will appear as wrestler rip rohrem such typecasting 
is not unusual rarely do wrestlers play romantic leads 
im not robert redford im a villain says big john studd a 
6foot9 blondhaired behemoth it doesnt bother me to play that 
kind of character ive been doing it my whole life 
playing that character you mean wrestlers are acting out there 
well yes but not the way you think the wrestlers say the 
performance is not in the ring at least no one admits to that 
its developing a persona and taking it on the road creating a good 
or evil character for televised interviews and arenas around the 
country 
bad guy rowdy roddy piper says he was so convincing in this 
violent version of the strasberg school that irate fans stabbed him 
three times and shot at him once 
in charlotte nc i was stabbed an inch from my heart 
theyre carrying me out on a stretcher and people were spitting at 
me throwing garbage at me recalls piper almost wistfully 
piper retired from the ring two years ago and turned actor at a 
moment when hollywood was newly receptive to wrestlers 
i think the headlines the national exposure of hulk hogan and 
the world wrestling federation opened a lot of peoples eyes says 
ventura a former wwf tagteam titlist and current wrestling 
announcer people started seeing us in a new light they finally 
realized hey these guys are talented at what they do 
while toughguy roles are the norm some wrestlers have been 
asked to play against type andre the giant the most hated man in 
wrestling according to one ring publication played the gentle 
giant fezzick in the critically acclaimed princess bride and 
drew favorable reviews

the giants acting instincts are pure and natural says 
director rob reiner he never missed a mark 
but princess bride a sweettempered humorous fairy tale 
was an extraordinary use of these kingsize performers the 
wrestlers know that more often than not their build bulk and 
badboy reputations land them their parts 
schwarzenegger stallone exfootball star fred dryer its 
hard to make people sympathize with these guys theyre large 
theyre goodlooking surrounded by pretty girls studd says so 
you get john studd to step on their heads a couple of times and then 
people feel sorry for them 
when ventura landed his role in predator he was responding 
to a call for a 6foot4 250pound killer 
i just walked in there with blond hair down to my shoulders 
about six earrings and a fu manchu mustache and i didnt even 
read ventura recalls the casting director he says looked me 
up and down two times then said lets go meet the producer 
ventura became so friendly with schwarzenegger during the filming 
that the exweightlifter invited him back for the running man 
the body has also just finished another film thunderground 
which is due out in 1989 it was easy to put wrestling behind him 
i was a 10year veteran and thats not the kind of career 
thats gonna last forever says ventura 37 an exbiker and 
vietnam veteran whose departure from the ring was hastened by blood 
clots 
piper made his acting debut battling amphibianlike mutants in 
the bflick hell comes to frogtown his review it was 
horrible just a joke 
but he was fortunate enough to hook up with director carpenter a 
wrestling fan in they live a sciencefiction film about a 
futuristic america overrun by wealthy aliensrepublicans 
piper an exgolden gloves boxer who lived for years on the 
streets of toronto says acting turned out to be more of a challenge 
than expected as a wrestler he was renowned for his sputtering 
stuttering fireworks in interviews before and after matches 
i came out to la originally figuring i was gonna be another 
james dean you know but everything i did in wrestling was wrong 
for acting its just the opposite for movies when i did the 
wrestling interview show pipers pit i improvised everything 
thats what people liked you know this guy is winging everything 
but when you take a 40foot by 20foot screen and im there 
going hello there i had to learn how to underplay to get 
down to get subdued piper says 
there are some problems studd has complaints about sleazy 
hollywood operators others object to typecasting why would i 
play a wrestler ventura asks everyone knows i can wrestle 
and then therere the critics the new york daily news reviewed 
they live under the headline they live but who cares 
a lot of people have always accused pro wrestlers of er 
acting in the ring the reviewer wrote but do i feel silly now 
if roddy piper is any indication wrestlers cant act a lick 
piper got the last laugh they live became the nations 
highest grossing film in its first week out but the rowdy one 
realizes he hasnt earned a star on hollywood boulevard and 
unemployment remains just a few nasty writeups away 
if this movie really goes i got a chance at being a major 
motion picture star piper says if it dont go i got a shot at 
being just another wrestler

editors note a decade ago a presidential commission described 
american incompetence in foreign languages as scandalous and 
suggested that was one of the reasons for the us trade deficit 
that may be debatable but the people at the state department agree 
that fluency in a foreign language is not an american trait 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when it comes to foreign languages says the 
state departments top linguist americans are somewhere at the 
bottom of the civilized world 
and that sure makes harry obsts job more difficult obst is 
director of language services the person in charge of providing 
interpreters and translators to the white house and 30 government 
agencies he spends much of his time scrambling for linguists to 
meet the growing demand 
sometimes obst comes up emptyhanded and has the unpleasant duty 
of informing cabinet officers or other highranking officials that 
his bureau is unable to provide an interpreter 
its very uncomfortable for me as director of this office to 
deal with that says obst who has about 25 slots each allotted 
for interpreters and translators also on his calling list are 1900 
private contractors mostly individuals 
obst himself was born in germany and interprets for visiting 
officials from his native land 
a few years ago there was jubilation at the state department 
when after a painstaking search a chinese language specialist was 
found for a longstanding vacancy more than 200 applicants had 
failed the test 
but within hours the linguist was lured away by occidental 
petroleum corp for a salary far in excess of the 40000 offered by 
the state department 
we never saw the gentleman report for duty here obst says 
the united states obst says pays relatively little attention to 
linguistic matters as compared with the soviet union china japan 
and even some smaller countries such as cuba 
the soviets reward some linguistic virtuosos with prestige 
ambassadorships and other key government posts the outgoing us 
ambassador to the united nations vernon walters himself a master 
of eight languages says the american goverment should adopt a 
similar practice 
thomas pickering the career diplomat george bush picked as his 
ambassador to the united nations is fluent in french spanish 
arabic and swahili 
there are many reasons for the lack of interest in foreign 
languages among americans in some parts of the country an american 
can go a lifetime and not hear any language but his own 
europeans have exposure to a multiplicity of languages within a 
relatively small area and emphasize language training throughout 
secondary school 
beyond that learning a foreign language can be a lonely arduous 
task the payoff for dedicated study often is long in coming there 
is little appeal for todays american youth to spend hours on end 
poring over flashcards in pushtu 
pushtu that is a language spoken in afghanistan when an afghan 
rebel leader visited washington in 1987 he asked that a nativeborn 
american be his interpreter rather than a naturalized american of 
afghan origin not surprisingly none was available 
a decade ago a presidential commission described american 
incompetence in foreign languages as scandalous it argued that 
one reason for the us trade deficit only a fraction then of what 
it is now is that americans dont speak other languages well enough 
to persuade foreigners to buy their products 
j william fulbright when he was chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee described the problem as cultural and 
linguistic myopia 
sen paul simon dill was so concerned that he wrote a book 
about the subject eight years ago the tonguetied american 
the concern is shared by dr robert gard president of the 
monterey institute of international studies in california one of 
the few campuses in the country that turns out accomplished 
linguists 
gard says the attitude of corporate executives seems to be that 
the rest of the world ought to learn how to speak english

that certainly was not the attitude of the legendary emil fossan 
the linguistic equivalent of babe ruth by 1984 when his 40year 
government career ended fossan was helping out the state department 
in 34 languages 
he was the most remarkable translator we ever had obst says 
several years ago the paucity of bright bilingual americans 
forced the state department to drop a requirement that candidates 
for the foreign service be fluent in a second language the reason 
was that too many talented people had to be passed over because of 
the requirement 
in other countries language training is mandatory in high 
school mandatory in college and as a result you have a good base 
from which you can work obst says 
stephen bosworth president of the united statesjapan 
foundation a private group based in new york says increasing 
numbers of us public schools want to add japanese to their 
curriculum but many cant find qualified teachers 
he adds that american businesses give low priority to expertise 
in japanese given a choice between giving a job to someone trained 
in japanese and another who has a masters in business 
administration theyll always pick the one with the mba he 
says 
at the state department a linguist must be able to interpret 
simultaneously and consecutively into both his native and acquired 
languages demands that are unheard of elsewhere obst says he 
must be able to toss off colloquialisms on issues ranging from rio 
grande salinity problems to high energy physics to the nuclear fuel 
cycle 
linguists say a nimble mind must be supplemented by a number of 
other traits as well motivation a spirit of adventure curiosity 
selfconfidence a wish to communicate and an omnivorous appetite 
for the myriad flavors that foreign cultures come in as the 
current issue of the foreign service journal puts it 
making life more difficult still for state department language 
recruiters is that the agencys salaries are generally smaller than 
those of international organizations which compete for the same 
talent 
at the state department an interpreter without supervisory 
responsibilities can earn up to 71000 for a translator who deals 
exclusively with printed material the peak salary is 65000 
he says salaries at the united nations are 10 percent to 15 
percent higher but others maintain the gap is even wider 
besides the united nations the state department also competes 
for linguists with such international organizations as the world 
bank the international monetary fund and the organization of 
american states unlike the state department these institutions can 
hire nonamericans and dont have to worry about security clearances 
according to obst experts in japanese russian chinese and 
portuguese are the most difficult to find 
one new yorkbased firm provides japaneselanguage interpreters 
for 450 a day when it hires a japanese language freelancer the 
state department pays 325 a day 300 for other languages 
still rubbing elbows with the president during a meeting with a 
foreign luminary is one of the attractions of interpreting for the 
state department 
stephanie van reigersberg chief of the state departments 
interpreting division and a fluent speaker of spanish and french 
sat at the side of george bush during his postelection meeting with 
mexicos new president carlos salinas de gortari 
ms van reigersberg says the psychic rewards of helping out the 
president and other top officials compensate for the other 
shortcomings of being a state department interpreter 
in contrast she says at the united nations its blah blah 
blah about structural adjustment loans 
the people who come tend to stay she says but finding 
people is getting to be impossible

editors note its called the four corners the area where 
colorado utah arizona and new mexico come together and its a 
region rich in indian artifacts a private group has established a 
nonprofit research center where you dont have to be a trained 
archaeologist to get a chance to dig 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
here in the southwest corner of colorado 
schoolchildren and other amateurs are digging alongside 
archaeologists hunting for clues to what happened to the anasazi 
indians who disappeared from the region more than 600 years ago 
stuart struever a selfstyled archaeologistentrepreneur and 
founder of the crow canyon archaeological center calls it a kind of 
intellectual outward bound referring to the wilderness training 
program that challenges people to test their physical limits 
about 1300 people came to crow canyon last year to get their 
hands in the dirt they included retirees from new york 
gradeschoolers from chicago teenagers from a nearby zuni 
reservation soviet young people on an exchange program 
several hundred other people attended the centers traveling 
seminars on southwestern archaeology 
under the supervision of trained researchers the student diggers 
excavate the ruins of the anasazi the ancient ones in the 
language of some of their apparent descendants the navajo 
the anasazi lived in the four corners region from about 500 bc 
until their sudden disappearance from much of the region about ad 
1300 archaeologists say 
money for crow canyons research and six fulltime researchers 
comes from students fees and contributions from individual and 
corporate patrons 
the center also has programs designed to bring in children from 
cortez and nearby indian tribes to teach them about the anasazi 
ian thompson a cortez native and local historian who is director 
of the crow canyon center says it has helped raise local 
consciousness about the anasazi and he hopes it will curb some of 
the pottery hunting that is destroying much of the anasazi heritage 
crow canyon lies on the relatively fertile mcelmo plateau 
elevation 6900 feet in the shadow of mesa verde where 
archaeologists earlier in the century excavated some of the 
bestknown anasazi cliff dwellings 
crow canyons campus just outside cortez includes research 
laboratories conference rooms the beginnings of a library 
artifactfilled sandboxes for children under 11 a cafeteria and 
dormitories that can house up to 100 people the dorms are shaped 
like hogans traditional pueblo indian dwellings 
a short drive away around a series of shallow canyons are the 
excavation sites a survey begun about five years ago revealed 454 
sites of anasazi ruins in about a 1mile circle roughly between the 
campus and sand canyon the major excavation site 
in this area very little topsoil accumulates over the years so 
it is easy to see centuriesold anasazi sites ringed by rocks in the 
middle of farmers fields 
aside from the major dig at sand canyon a handful of test sites 
also are being excavated 
bruce bradley director of the sand canyon excavation says the 
mcelmo plateau is rich in anasazi ruins but has not been explored 
much by archaeologists who have concentrated more on mesa verde and 
other sites 
bradley hopes to learn more about the final stages of the anasazi 
civilization and perhaps find out what happened to them 
one day recently about a dozen adult volunteers were digging 
under the sun at one of the test sites near sand canyon among them 
were david and bernice gotlieb a retired couple from new york 
weve been armchair archaeologists voyeurs but this is our 
first time with our hands in it said david gotlieb 64 as he 
rubbed the soil he had just dug through a screen to see if it 
contained any pottery shards or other items 
digging he says gives him a sense of history and the 
curiosity that goes with it 
the gotliebs who uncovered some ancient postholes in their area 
the day before said they planned to come back to dig every year 
the gotliebs supervisor mark varien says he enjoys working 
with lay people 
varien who wears a cowboy hat with beaded indian band came to 
crow canyon after two years as archaeologist for the zunis 
archaeology is not this elitist thing that only archaeologists 
can do he says cultural resources are our heritage and people 
should be able to participate in that 
this is not struevers first experiment in combining research 
with public education in his native illinois as director of the 
center for american archaeology and professor of archaeology at 
northwestern university struever directed the huge excavation at 
the koster site in kampsville which drew thousands of students and 
lay archaeologists in the 1970s 
struevers introduction to the southwest came when he moved to 
telluride in 1976 to write a book about koster he said he quickly 
became a convert to anasazi archaeology and the magical region 
struever says he wants crow canyon to be a prototype for future 
archaeological projects 
struever went first for support to ray duncan a denverbased 
oilman who also is principal stockholder of purgatory ski area near 
durango and who grew up with struever in peru ill 
duncan became crow canyons principal benefactor and now is 
chairman of the board of directors 
thompson says the nonprofit crow canyon had a 12 million 
budget this year about 85 percent of which came from tuition 
payments 
its working its way toward selfsufficiency he says 
the center also won a national science foundation grant for 
62000 to be used for research 
last year it cost 645 for an adult digger to spend a week at 
crow canyon for schoolchildren it usually costs about 60 a day 
but for children in the economically troubled cortez area the 
center subsidizes the digging charging only 2 a day 
the center also has a 6000 scholarship fund that allows indian 
students to come dig 
were trying to elevate the public consciousness here we want 
them to know about their own area struever says

game show host pat sajak is starting a new 
latenight talk show on cbs this week but hes not bragging that 
hes taking on johnny carson headon 
neither sajak nor cbs want to oversell the show the way the 
syndicated thicke of the night was trumpeted in 1983 
we dont want that kind of preshow hype because theres no way 
you can live up to it sajak says we want people to know were 
coming but we dont want to build up expectations 
sajak says his exposure as host of wheel of fortune will 
help people know me thats half the battle 
sajak has quit the daytime version of wheel of fortune on 
nbc but will continue as host of the nighttime show the 
highestrated show in syndication 
the pat sajak show makes its debut on cbs on monday putting 
the network back into the talk show business for the first time 
since it canceled merv griffin in 1972 it was griffin who as 
producer of wheel of fortune lifted sajak a former tv 
weatherman out of obscurity 
ive always wanted to do latenight television sajak says 
thats a pretty narrow thing to aim for it only took 30 years 
cbs turned again to a talk show to try to recoup its latenight 
losses more than a fourth of its affiliate stations deserted the 
networks rotating actionadventure shows but announcement of the 
sajak show has brought most of the defecting stations back 
apparently 90 percent of the cbs stations will broadcast the show 
it looks like a renewal of the old talk show wars when griffin 
on cbs and dick cavett on abc plus david frost and mike douglas in 
syndication took on carson now besides sajak joan rivers and 
arsenio hall are joining the fray with new syndicated talk shows 
but this time each show is looking to find its own niche and 
audience taking on carson headon or even appearing to as 
thicke of the night and joan rivers tried is an invitation to 
disaster 
we have great respect for johnny but we dont plan our show 
around him sajak says i think cbs has realistic expectations 
they dont think we have to knock someone off to be a success 
actuall johnnys been very gracious to me he once asked me to be a 
guest host 
sajak will find himself competing not only against carson but 
against the first half of nbcs late night with david letterman 
his new show will be 90 minutes while carson has long since had his 
show cut to an hour when you get going you want to be there as 
much as you can sajak says 
once sajak got the goahead from cbs one of the first things he 
did was talk to others who had attempted talk shows and failed 
the one thing we kept hearing was that too many chiefs too 
many vice presidents too many executive producers were running 
around giving orders he says everybody had ideas and the host 
was forced to squeeze them all in 
so were going to keep it simple theres just myself and the 
producer paul gilbert we basically make the decisions cbs has had 
the courage of its convictions too often going on tv is like a 
marriage you marry someone because you love them then spend the 
next five years trying to change them i am very wary of network 
interference 
sajak who concedes he is a traditionalist says he is baffled by 
some of the changes in television particularly the turn taken by 
afternoon talk shows 
i dont know what to make of all this chairthrowing and trash 
tv he says i hope its just a passing fad 
he cautions viewers against expecting anything radical he will 
not be different just for the sake of being different 
you make it different by bringing your own personality to it 
he says its the pat sajak show thats the only talent i have 
being pat sajak the reason so few people have succeeded in this is 
that they feel they should always be in the spotlight and get all 
the laughs you have to step aside and let your guests shine when 
your guests look good you look good 
sajak recalls that as a youngster he frequently climbed out of 
bed late at night to watch jack paar who was host of the tonight 
show before carson 
i was at jacks house in connecticut recently he says it 
was fun to hear the old stories get some advice look at some old 
tapes and relive the past a little

taped to the mirror in david dukes dressing room 
at the eugene oneill theater are several pieces of white paper 
filled with scribbles they are his lifeline to understanding the 
plot of m butterfly 
but the jottings dont even tell the entire story of the complex 
and fascinating play the actor says the scrawl pertains just to 
my action what his character goes through scene by scene in 
this tony awardwinning broadway hit about a bizarre 20year love 
affair between a french diplomat and a chinese opera singer who 
turns out to be a man 
its the only way i can keep the whole play in my mind says 
dukes who portrays the deluded desperate diplomat if things 
start to go wrong on stage ill just stare at the paper for a while 
and try to track the characters development again its very easy 
in a long run to go in directions that youre not quite aware of and 
eventually find youre getting too serious or too comic or 
whatever 
for dukes a highly verbal intense and quickwitted actor the 
role has brought high praise including cheers from new york theater 
critics who came back to see the play after he replaced its original 
star john lithgow 
you could describe the 43yearold dukes as one of those new 
york theater actors who always works except that he happens to 
live in california and works all over television and movies too 
tv audiences know him from a slew of miniseries space 
kane and abel george washington and most recently the 
winds of war and war and remembrance in which he played 
leslie slote 
broadway theatergoers might remember him from runs in bent 
and as part of the replacement casts in amadeus and dracula 
dukes took over from lithgow in m butterfly last august after 
only two weeks of rehearsal but its easier he says going into a 
play that already is running in fact he watches his predecessors 
for tips 
i believe in selective theft dukes says with a grin 
theres a great advantage coming in and replacing somebody you 
get to see the whole thing john lithgow until he saw my dress 
rehearsal never did get to see the whole production 
dukes also talked extensively with lithgow who is an old friend 
about the role the conversations were invaluable 
john dexter the director was ill and couldnt attend dukes 
rehearsals so stuart ostrow the shows producer and the stage 
manager acted as his director lithgow also watched dukes last 
dresstechnical rehearsal and used the occasion to tell his 
successor everything about the role that dexter had told him 
lithgows most specific advice 
remember the music of the play dukes recalls the speeches 
do have a musical tone to them 
ask dukes for a description of the character he plays and hell 
quickly say a dork an unromantic male who is lucky to have a 
wife 
at the same time the diplomat serves as the narrator of the 
play and must tell the story with confidence and assuredness 
dukes adds there are a lot of strange conflicting colors in this 
play 
to conserve his energy for the marathon that is m butterfly 
dukes hibernates much of the day hell do voiceover auditions for 
television commercials since they dont require much physical 
effort but not much else 
theres no way around the fact he says this role does you 
in thats why he signed only for a sixmonth run and is eager to 
get home to california and his wife and 5yearold daughter his 
wife carol muske teaches at the university of south california and 
has a novel dear digby coming out in april 
still dukes will usually go anywhere for a good acting job that 
passion wasnt always there it wasnt until dukes did a play his 
senior year in high school in marin county calif that he wanted 
to become an actor he went to college as a math major but by the 
end of his freshman year had switched to speech and drama because 
girls like actors much more than they like mathematicians 
after graduating from college dukes acted and worked behind the 
scenes at the american conservatory theater in san francisco and 
never looked back for act and touring companies that came through 
san francisco he also worked as a stagehand 
dukes began jumping from repertory company to repertory company 
working for the alley theater in houston the san diego shakespeare 
festival the mark taper forum in los angeles and then the charles 
street playhouse in boston 
in 1971 dukes received his first new york show a revival of 
molieres a school for wives with brian bedford and joan van 
ark it turned into a hit and later toured the country making his 
name known in new york 
theater work is what i think i do best he says when i 
step on a stage its a world i know cameras and me are not close 
friends 
but youve got to do television and film if i had done more of 
it perhaps they would have asked me to originate this role in m 
butterfly dukes adds yet ive never burned to be a star you 
have to have enough of a name to get the big parts with the best 
people 
im also one of those faces because i change my look for jobs 
that people will look at and say didnt i go to college with you 
in virginia i go through that a lot they think they know me but 
they cant remember where

they said it couldnt be done torch song trilogy the 
soulsearching saga of a gay mans life and loves seemed less 
likely than most plays to translate successfully to film 
the 1982 broadway hit was memorable for its performances but also 
for its stagecraft a pivotal comedy scene played on two gigantic 
beds could be executed only on stage the controversial back room 
scene depicting anonymous sexual encounters through implication 
seemed destined to offend on screen 
but surprise of surprises torch song has become a movie and 
the result is deeply affecting 
harvey fierstein who created torch song and won a tony for 
his lead role on broadway has skillfully adapted the story and his 
own performance to the big screen he appears in virtually every 
scene and is always fascinating to watch 
torch song which might have seemed hopelessly dated in the 
age of aids turns out to be as relevant as ever on questions of gay 
selfrespect and parental clashes with a homosexual offspring 
it is called a trilogy because three stories are interwoven all 
revolving around arnold beckoff fierstein a young gay man who 
works as a female impersonator part 1 centers on arnolds 
relationship with ed his first love brian kerwin manages to give 
great appeal to the character of ed a bisexual who cant be true to 
his male or female lover 
act 2 introduces us to alan a young model who replaces ed in 
arnolds affections matthew broderick is sweetly touching as the 
doomed alan who decides to marry arnold and adopt a child 
the finale focuses on the greatest anguish of arnolds life his 
relationship with his domineering disappointed mother but mrs 
beckoff is not one of anne bancrofts greatest performances the 
role was created on stage by estelle getty who gave the part a 
vulnerability missing from the shrewish interpretation chosen by 
bancroft and director paul bogart 
to their credit fierstein and bogart have shortened the back 
room scene and carefully labeled each significant development with 
dates to stress this is a story of the 1970s not the aidsconscious 
1980s 
torch song trilogy which is rated r for sexual subject 
matter is not a film just for gay audiences at its heart it is a 
story of interpersonal relationships and the universal search for 
love and understanding which transcends sexual orientation

eleonore and percy adlon a couple of german filmmakers fell in 
love with the wacky desert light in bagdad a defunct town outside 
barstow calif they made a movie about lovable eccentrics who 
inhabit a roadside truckstop 
its lovely to see the desert light and watch tractortrailer

this awkward conventional stolidly germanic film with which to 
contend 
marianne sagebrecht plays the plump hausfrau jasmin who is 
stranded at the cafe run by brenda ch pounder whose slightly 
crazed unfocused rage is unsettling jack palance as a painter is 
still jack palance 
this slight smarmy movie got big mileage at the art houses for 
reasons that mystify its reminiscent of the brazilian comedy 
altemira which had more important things to say about travel 
misfits and entertainment

california roll cbs osamu 
 
east is east and west is west right 
not according to japanese composer and musician osamu whos 
successfully blended traditional oriental rhythms with fasterpaced 
jazz and rock on california roll 
for western music lovers whove heard some pleasing eastern tunes 
but dont know what to buy at the record store california roll 
is an ideal aurally palatable introduction 
the album which is osamu kitajimas third in the united states 
is a showcase for the chinese koto a 13string zitherlike 
instrument that emits the precise delicate sound familiar to 
westerners as oriental music 
but dont get the idea that california roll is nothing but 
inscrutable meandering its too full of stateoftheart 
electronics for that 
osamu plays all the instruments on four of the nine songs that 
feature the koto surrounded by a patter of percussion bells and 
synthesized sounds 
songs such as escape space back street to paradise and 
white in flight with their sensitive melodies and 
slowerthanslow rhythms lend a sensation of limbolike suspension 
to the listener they also wouldnt sound out of place on a miami 
vice soundtrack 
osamu can rip out a hot rock guitar lick as well on leading 
edge the guitar stakes out the melody followed by a bridge on 
the koto eastern eyes western skies features an extended 
guitar solo as does the even harderrocking samurai lover 
the title of california roll refers to an american version of 
that japanese favorite sushi osamus musical synthesis gives 
western ears a taste of that countrys sonic delicacy

big time island tom waits 
 
much of tom waits music is difficult but big time is 
impossible the poor sound quality makes it that way 
big time released in conjunction with the concert film of 
the same name contains live performances of songs from waits three 
most recent studio albums swordfishtrombone rain dogs and 
franks wild years fans already familiar with the material may 
find big time of interest but the uninitiated likely will be 
frustrated by the task of trying to decipher waits lyrics 
when his gravelcoated voice isnt too far from the mike its 
too close and on three songs that were mixed live to cassette the 
singing is overwhelmed by tape hiss its too bad because the 
enigmatic waits is clever with words a lyric sheet would have 
helped but waits fivepiece backup band is mired in aural muck 
too 
there are times when sound quality that is less than 
stateoftheart enhances a performance bruce springsteens 
nebraska album comes to mind and waits last of the beatniks 
is anything but a digital performer but the smalltime sound on 
big time causes the medium to block the message

with mel gibson and michelle pfeiffer decided that los angeles 
lakers coach pat riley had the kind of look his part required a 
look the actor describes as relaxed gq 
there are very few men that have the confidence to wear an 
outrageous fashion statement said russell who emulates rileys 
slickedback hair and welltailored suits in the movie 
i felt that pat rileys look was right for this film because he 
was arrogantly confident but not offensive its very tough to do 
that 
russell plays a police officer investigating a drug dealer who is 
also an old high school friend gibson and who is involved with a 
mysterious mexican drug lord raul julia russell seduces pfeiffer 
the owner of a fashionable restaurant and gibsons friend and uses 
her to extract information on the drug dealer 
i feel good about the chemistry of michelle and myself and 
mel russell said it reminded me of doing silkwood with meryl 
streep and cher i always felt there were three specific people in 
the room and they each in a good way brought something to the 
other 
russell emerges as a negative character in tequila sunrise 
because he manipulates both gibson and pfeiffer for his own ends 
however the actor enjoyed his role 
i like the style of some of those old gangster movies that 
james cagney did you didnt pull for him but you did feel bad 
when he got killed off cagney played the worst guy in the room i 
was drawn to that character he said 
russell a child star in disney movies follow me boys 
the computer wore tennis shoes the fox and the hound has 
a long history of playing bad guys 
a lot of people take walt disney and lump it all together the 
first picture i did i was the tough kid on the block my father was 
an alcoholic and i was slingshotting everybody he said 
russells career sagged through most of the 1970s until he landed 
the starring role in the television movie elvis it was russell 
admitted a nearly impossible task 
elvis presley is the second most recognizable unit to 
cocacola the only thing tougher to do is play the cocacola 
logo he said 
but russell managed to receive surprisingly positive reviews and 
has gone on to be one of the most popular actors of the 80s 
appearing in silkwood and used cars among other films 
with that popularity has come success how does he handle it 
failure is quite easy to deal with because its right there and 
its much less complex than success the actor said success can 
become very complex dealing with your ego and dealing with greed 
you begin to make amounts of money you dont want to stop making 
money has freed him though to enjoy more private time in 1983 
he fell in love with actress goldie hawn while they were making 
swing shift they have houses in california and colorado hawn 
was an old friend of tequila sunrise writerdirector robert 
towne 
i find robert townes style inexplicibly hypnotic russell 
said of the screenwriter of the last detail and chinatown 
he makes you keep turning the pages youre not exactly sure 
why i feel that way about bob towne as a human being as well 
russell the son of tv actor bing russell grew up in southern 
california in 1963 at the age of 12 he made his film debut in the 
elvis presley movie it happened at the worlds fair 
but he loved sports more than acting and spent some time playing 
minor league baseball for the san diego padres and california 
angels a shoulder injury suffered at age 22 ended his baseball 
career sports continues to pop up in russells conversation 
especially when he makes comparisons to acting 
actings the easiest job in the world he said i am 
accused of not liking actors i do like them but they think 
somebody interfering with their ever important performance is an 
obstacle 
they havent faced nolan ryan with the winning run on third 
base thats an obstacle or face mike ditka with four yards to go 
theres an obstacle thats tough to get around 
i watched a guy drilling in the street and he comes to this 
point where he gets into this stuff thats heavy concrete this guy 
had an obstacle 
russell brings an athletes sense of concentration to his work 
you must get zeroed in nothing else exists when youre doing 
it russell explained i would like to think if im on this 
jackhammer or getting across the goal line it would be the same 
way

it was eight days before christmas and a 
homesick mirella freni was grateful to bizet for writing the 
character of micaela out of act 4 of carmen 
the soprano had an alitalia flight to catch to italy where her 
mother daughter two grandchildren and other relatives awaited a 
holiday reunion in her hometown of modena 
since i can leave early ill be on the plane saturday night 
miss freni said in an interview the day before the matinee 
performance i hated to wait an extra day 
it was an unexpected coup for the metropolitan opera to persuade 
miss freni at age 53 still one of the worlds most soughtafter 
sopranos to stop in new york for two performances as micaela she 
was on her way home from san francisco where she had appeared with 
luciano pavarotti in puccinis la boheme 
micaela the girlnextdoor who loses the affections of the 
soldier don jose to the gypsy carmen is usually sung by sopranos 
early in their career miss freni made her stage debut in the part 
in 1955 but had not sung it anywhere in 15 years 
mostly they want me for more demanding roles now she said 
but the met said oh please mirella just two performances on 
your way home and one is the radio broadcast i am happy i can 
still sing the role 
snaring the superstar even for two performances was part of the 
mets renewed emphasis on glamorous casts appearing with her was 
mezzo marilyn horne as carmen and bass samuel ramey as the toreador 
escamillo 
though the role of micaela is relatively short an extended duet 
in act 1 and a showpiece aria in act 3 it is not without its 
challenges 
toscanini made the aria a required part of auditions for lyric 
sopranos at la scala miss freni said it calls for a little of 
everything recitative pianissimo long phrases high notes 
that she can still meet all those challenges is remarkable 
considering that miss freni long ago ventured beyond the lyric 
repertory into heavier dramatic roles such as desdemona in verdis 
otello the title role in his aida and puccinis manon 
lescaut 
some critics have regretted her decision noting that the more 
heroic roles inevitably stretch and harden a sopranos voice but 
miss freni has had more success than most in retaining the mellow 
tones required of a lyric soprano 
i dont try to be more dramatic than i am miss freni said 
i still think of myself as basically a lyric soprano but with 
other possibilities i know very well my limitations 
for instance she said aida is comfortable for her because much 
of the part lies in the upper register where she is strong but 
amelia in verdis un ballo in maschera and leonora in his la 
forza del destino proved unworkable because those roles require a 
lot of heavy singing for the middle voice 
the soprano will be back at the met in february to begin 
rehearsals for one of the newest roles in her repertory tatyana in 
tchaikovskys eugene onegin 
i always loved the music but i was afraid because its in 
russian she said 
about six years ago maestro bruno bartoletti asked her to sing 
it at chicagos lyric opera and she agreed studying intensively 
with a russian language coach and getting support from her 
husband bass nicolai ghiaurov who was born in bulgaria and speaks 
fluent russian 
nicolai helped me whenever i would panic she said id 
say nicolai nicolai how do you say this and he would show me 
and get me to calm down 
she has since triumphed in the opera repeatedly at vienna la 
scala londons covent garden now the bolshoi opera has invited her 
to sing the role a rare honor for a foreigner 
im a little nervous but were trying to work out a time when 
i can do it she said 
she is also studying another tchaikovsky role lisa in pique 
dame for la scala in 1990 
miss freni freely admits that her transition to the more dramatic 
repertory has not been completely smooth sailing 
naturally ive made mistakes im human she said i did 
verdis traviata too early verdis ernani wasnt too bad 
but its not my kind of opera the role was too tattattat and my 
specialty is long phrases so i said goodbye to that 
one mistake she was asked to make but didnt was to record the 
title role of puccinis turandot a part that has been 
identified with such stentorian sopranos as birgit nilsson and ghena 
dimitrova miss freni has long been identified with the lyric 
soprano role in that opera the slave girl liu 
can you believe it turandot laughed miss freni i am not 
arteriosclerotic i am a grandmother but not in that way 
in fact its hard to believe that the glamorous miss freni with 
her golden blond hair and radiant smile is a grandmother in any 
way she looks remarkably unchanged from the young singer who first 
thrilled audiences around the world in the early 1960s with her warm 
and generous singing 
growing up in italy during and after world war ii miss freni 
never wavered in her choice of careers 
i remember when i was 5 and someone asked me what i wanted to 
be i said an opera singer she recalled i was really 
crazy 
when she was breaking into the profession the two reigning and 
rival sopranos were maria callas and renata tebaldi the former an 
intensely dramatic singer the latter noted for her golden thread of 
sound 
i admired both of them but i tried not to model myself on 
either she said i told myself mirella dont be a bad copy 
of someone else better to be a small freni

david glasper is proud to be part of a pop 
band 
as soon as you say that word people sneer at it said 
glasper lead singer of the english group breathe 
the beatles played it the stones played it we just want to be 
generally accepted if weve written a handful of classic records 
we would have achieved what we wanted to do 
but acceptance for pop stars means hit singles and breathe had 
to endure an unimaginably difficult road in working to get its songs 
played on the radio their debut album all that jazz was 
released in august 1987 and proceeded to go nowhere worse the 
group feuded with its manager and the two sides parted ways 
he was frustrated glasper said we had released seven 
singles in the united kingdom to no avail we were wondering what we 
could do youre bound to start questioning things 
and questioning each other 
because we took so long to happen the relationship became 
really strained we were all just screaming at each other he said 
the story of breathe however was to take an unexpected turn for 
the better in 1988 hands to heaven the albums second single 
began getting heavy airplay on american adult contemporary stations 
and eventually became a top 20 hit on the pop charts 
its a song we really believed in glasper said its about 
separation a man married for 50 years called a radio station in 
chicago and said the song was for him he had been to the navy and 
had been away from his wife a lot 
glasper now in his mid20s grew up in the suburbs of london and 
showed an early interest in music ive always been singing i 
used to walk around the house humming i was involved in choir at 
school i was brought up on the doobie brothers led zeppelin pink 
floyd music like that 
he and his childhood friend guitarist marcus lillington formed 
breathe with drummer ian spice and bassist mick delahunty in the 
early 1980s 
we used to massacre classic records like stairway to heaven 
and its different for girls glasper recalled then we 
started experimenting its like a craft 
they also had to experiment with giving the group a name they 
started with catch22 and ran through several others before settling 
on breathe 
the name was never a concious decision glasper said we 
were looking to change our name when we decided to use breathe for a 
local gig because we had a song of that name on the posters 
breathe began recording its first record back in 1985 a little 
too soon in glaspers opinion 
our band hadnt really jelled into any one thing we spent a 
lot of time in the studio writing and experimenting towards the 
later stage of the album we kind of found out what kind of band 
wed like to be he said 
what hurt the group glasper said was managements emphasis on a 
major selling point for most pop bands appearance 
we were four young guys it doesnt take much business acumen 
to see we could have appeal to teenage girls but we realized that 
we wanted to be involved in songwriting and prove ourselves that 
way our first manager used to scream at us about image 
ironically breathe ended up making its breakthrough in the 
united states with an older audience 
hands to heaven is quite a mature sounding record people 
thought we were a lot older than we actually were glasper said 
but he found that being called an adult contemporary band has 
its drawbacks too and promised that the group would do something 
about it 
weve got really stuck into an image like chicago or air 
supply but we have some uptempo songs written for the next album 
theres going to be a big ballad but weve got a lot of faster 
songs he said 
i know that the songs weve written at the moment are not our 
best its exciting because we dont know what well end up sounding 
like 
one of the new songs is called satisfy and glasper has good 
reason to feel pleased how can i fall the second single from 
all that jazz is selling well and the album itself has cracked 
the top 40 
when we first finished recording all that jazz we started 
thinking can we write songs and then there came a point where 
nothing had happened and we asked what were we doing wrong we were 
getting paranoid he said 
it was such a relief that the record was a hit and we could 
say yeah i told you so

alex haley whose monumental and deeply moving 
roots a chronicle of his descent from slave ancestry that 
inspired americans of all races to explore and take pride in their 
past has written a new book that is as small in scope as roots 
was large 
a different kind of christmas doubleday and co 15 is a 
slim volume that tells the tale of fletcher randall the son of a 
wealthy southern plantation owner who undergoes a moral conversion 
and joins the underground railroad to help free a group of slaves 
haley in new york recently to promote the book said that 
although the tale was fictional the workings of the underground 
railroad as portrayed in the novella are accurate 
if youve researched slavery a lot as i have for roots you 
automatically know a lot about the phase of it called the 
underground railroad a network of quakers abolitionists former 
slaves and others who set up an escape route for slaves to find 
their way north to freedom he said 
the underground railroad could not have worked but for whites 
who were antislavery and for blacks who were willing to lay their 
lives on the line to help others escape 
a different kind of christmas is surprisingly haleys first 
book since the pulitzer prizewinning roots published in 1976 
it is written in a simple style that lends itself to being read 
aloud to the family over the course of two or three evenings before 
christmas 
haley was asked if he had such an oral tradition in mind when he 
wrote it 
i always write like that or like to think i do said the 
author who was born in ithaca ny but raised in a small town in 
western tennessee and credits the souths great storytelling 
tradition as his chief writing influence 
i grew up with my grandmother and her sisters sitting on the 
front porch in henning tennessee population 475 after supper 
early dark sitting in rocking chairs dipping snuff skeeting snuff 
at lightning bugs over the honeysuckle vines and telling stories 
night after night after night so i enjoy writing stories as if i 
were telling them he said in an accent as sweetly southern as the 
honeysuckle he recalled 
it was his grandmothers and greataunts storytelling that led 
haley to devote 12 years meticulously tracing his mothers side of 
the family back six generations to a small village in gambia west 
africa the product of his obsessive labor evolved into roots the 
saga of an american family a mix of painstakingly authenticated 
fact and imagined fictional detail it was an instant best seller 
and the 12hour miniseries adapted from the book drew 130 million 
viewers then the largest audience in television history 
set in 1855 a different kind of christmas focuses on how 
fletcher sent up north to be educated at princeton university 
slowly converts from pro to antislavery after he is befriended by 
some philadelphia quakers 
why did haley choose to make the hero of his tale a wealthy 
southern white instead of say a slave or freed black man 
if youre going to tell the story of the underground railroad 
you can tell it from any number of points of view i wanted to 
show fletchers mind change he said a black perspective would 
be one thing from the very beginning and that would be to get free 
a white mind would go from being in a white world and a white 
perspective to turning 180 degrees to get to where fletcher got 
a different kind of christmas was first conceived as a 
novelization of the christmas television special that was broadcast 
dec 11 roots the gift featuring kunta kinte fiddler and 
other characters from the book and miniseries however the 
screenwriters strike earlier this year prevented haley from 
collaborating with the tv script writer on the project so he 
created a new cast of characters for a tale set several decades 
after the tv special 
haley 67 started his writing career while in the us coast 
guard he contributed to readers digest playboy and other magazines 
before publishing his first book the autobiography of malcolm 
x which sprang out of a series of playboy interviews haley 
conducted with the civil rights leader 
roots catapulted him to fame at age 55 and the author 
acknowledged that celebrity has its price four plagiarism suits 
were filed against him one was settled out of court and three 
others dismissed and he is so in demand for speaking engagements 
that its difficult for him to find time to write 
still he asserted when i talk about the negatives im 
talking about at best 10 percent ninety percent of its got to be 
beautiful to this day people come up to me on the street every 
race imaginable and say thank you thats holy you cant top 
that 
to escape the steady stream of phone calls and speech requests 
haley tries to book passage on a cargo ship roughly four times a 
year spending a month or more writing 12 to 14 hours a day 
he has spent the last several voyages working on a host of 
projects haley hopes henning a book of memoirs of his youth in 
tennessee will be out next year followed by madame cj an 
account of cj walker who became the first woman in america to 
earn 1 million she was a black woman who sold hair preparations 
for black women 
one might assume that the author of a christmas tale would have 
plans for a a traditional holiday to be spent with family and 
friends but haley expected christmas eve to find him scribbling 
away aboard a cargo ship 
when i publish a book thats christmas he said

mike warnke is one of a kind hes part 
evangelist and part standup comic or as some folks say hes a 
standup jimmy swaggart with long hair 
the 43yearold christian humorist and recording artist who has 
shoulderlength locks is also a former heroin addict and satanist 
high priest who once had more than 1500 worshippers 
noting his background he says if god can use me he can use 
anybody 
he shares his religious faith at up to 22 personal appearances a 
month hes just released his 12th humor album one in a 
million on dayspring records of nashville 
he employs 30 people at his ministry office in burgin ky where 
he has noted a marked rise in telephone calls from people including 
the police asking about the occult 
theres been a dramatic increase in the past three years he 
said in a telephone interview were seeing younger kids getting 
involved it used to be people age 20 but now its 13 and 14 id 
say 70 percent of the calls deal with the occult this is a 
frightening trend 
warnke who wrote the 1972 book the satan seller which has 
sold more than 3 million copies believes theres a definite link 
between the occult and heavy metal music 
weve never investigated a case with the police where heavy 
metal was not a factor the music drives the lyrics into the 
conscious and subconscious then theres the clothing the attitudes 
of the musicians the things they say and the lifestyles they 
purport and the symbols 
the symbols include demoniclooking caricatures horns worn on 
heads and upside down crosses 
he compares music to lumber in that either can be used for good 
purposes or otherwise if you put a 2by4 in the hands of the ku 
klux klan its bad but in the hands of a carpenter its not 
warnke who has been featured on the tv show 2020 says he 
began his involvement with the occult at age 12 or 13 he joined a 
coven in the early 1960s when he was in college and became a 
satanist high priest 
i was the star sinner on campus he recalled 
he used heroin heavily and some of his satanic followers tried 
to murder him by injecting him with an overdose of heroin and 
leaving him on the streets of san bernadino calif to die 
passersby saw him and took him to a hospital where his recovery 
began 
if id have had to kick it addiction in the streets id have 
been dead for sure warnke said 
he later joined the navy and served one tour of duty in vietnam 
he became a christian and devoted himself to preaching against 
satanism 
after his records started coming out record world magazine 
honored him as the contemporary and inspirational nonmusical artist 
of the year 197679 
he estimates he speaks to more than 1 million people a year he 
has performed for the queen of denmark and the king of sweden and 
been to australia new zealand south africa and canada 
hes drafting a sequel to the satan seller that is due out 
soon 
ive never been a perfect christian warnke said thats 
where i deviate from others who seem to have a mandate to tell 
everyone else how to live jesus has been a perfect jesus and i 
just try to spend time talking about him and not me 
what im trying to put across to christians is that you dont 
have to be stereotypical the lord will use you no matter who you 
are for people who dont know jesus we hope they see him and get 
saved 
warnke a native of evansville ind said threats against his 
life picked up after he began working with police on cases involving 
satanism 
the threats used to be just rhetoric but people have jumped on 
stage with knives and ive been shot at backstage i just keep 
ducking he said

im going to get a motor car im going to 
learn how to drive says bruce quinn 32 years old and legally 
blind 
quinn who expects by summer to run two radio stations 50 miles 
apart in northern indiana may be licensed to drive for the first 
time using glasses equipped with small telescopes to spot details 
like signs and lights 
im excited about it i got a moped a few years ago and ive 
had a lot of fun with it and never any trouble so i should be all 
right said quinn of delphi it offers me a lot of 
opportunities something called freedom goodbye to greyhound a lot 
of handicapped people are stuck on greyhound 
california and texas have been licensing bioptic drivers for more 
than 10 years and about 25 states have such programs for as many as 
2000 nationwide said warren brown indiana bureau of motor 
vehicles director of licensing 
brown developed indianas bioptic registration program at the 
urging of a vocational rehabilitation counselor and with help from 
lowvision optometrists 
i thought it was the greatest idea in the world when i heard 
it its nice to do a little good for someone he said you 
wouldnt believe how sad it is to tell a man he cannot drive again 
ive had men cry driving is probably the single most important 
thing in any mans life 
optometrist paul bither who helped write indianas licensing 
guidelines says not everyone is suited for the program getting a 
license is a major step toward independence but its not 
something that i push he said driving is a great privilege 
but its also a great responsibility 
in indiana bioptic drivers must have vision correctable to 
20200 in glasses 2040 through the telescopes with up to 4x 
magnification a horizontal visual field of 130 degrees and no major 
blind spots color defects or other visual problems they must be 
evaluated and fit for the telescope get a sixmonth learners 
permit and training available only in south bend indianapolis and 
evansville and pass a road test 
the telescopes cost 500 to more than 2000 they vary in size 
and weight but the most common are about an inch in diameter and 
about 6 ounces they may extend a few inches at a slight angle 
upward from the top of the glasses over the users strongest eye or 
in some cases both when the user needs to see some detail he tilts 
his head forward to look through the scope 
most bioptic drivers especially the older ones tend to drive 
only in familiar areas said optometrist dr debra mcconnaha of 
indiana university its possible they might be able to drive to 
the grocery and back without using the telescope its there if they 
need it 
supporters of the program say bioptic drivers must be able to 
glance through the telescopes and spot something in less than a 
second about the time drivers with normal vision might spend 
looking in a rearview mirror 
opponents say thats impossible 
dr gerald fonda a livingston nj ophthalmologist whos been 
prescribing bioptic glasses since 1947 said bioptic drivers need at 
least three seconds to adjust to looking through the telescope spot 
the detail and then readjust to looking through normal glasses he 
said the telescope creates a blind spot that is twice as wide as the 
field of vision through the scope 
the purpose of the telescope is to pass the drivers test 
theres no evidence this device is safe and there is overwhelming 
evidence it is a hazard fonda said 
dr arthur h keeney professor of ophthalmology at the 
university of louisville medical school says the telescopes create 
an illusion of nearness to objects and that an awning effect 
obscures overhead signs he and fonda support letting lowvision 
sufferers drive under restricted privileges such as under 35 mph 
only and not on freeways 
there are lots of ways to help people without encumbering with 
an optical device that imposes limitations keeney said 
a 1983 study of bioptic drivers in california showed they were 
nearly twice as likely as the general driving population to have an 
accident said bill gengler spokesman for that states department 
of motor vehicles 
the accident rate was higher but not significantly in fact 
it was lower than rates for a variety of other types of california 
licensed drivers with different medical conditions gengler said 
despite the accident rate advocates claim bioptic drivers are 
among the most careful on the road bioptics say they know their 
limitations and wont exceed them or else risk losing part of their 
independence 
we stress the safedriving aspect as part of the privileges we 
get as drivers said marc sessions president of the 1000member 
american bioptic certified drivers based in laguna niguel calif he 
said the groups initials abcd also stand for always be careful 
driving 
teresa canada 34 of jasonville started driving at 16 but lost 
her license eight years ago because of her vision i have to be 
more careful than others if i feel i am not capable i am not going 
to be on the roads said canada driving through downtown 
indianapolis after her road test in october 
until she got a bioptic license canada had to call her husband 
at work if an emergency came up at home with any of their four 
children its been eight years since ive been able to drive so 
ive been in a kind of a prison

american chestnuts could once again line 
eastern avenues if an experimental vaccination technique proves 
successful against the fungus that devastated the stately trees 
three decades ago 
two stands of trees treated 10 years ago by the connecticut 
agricultural experiment station are not only thriving and producing 
tasty nuts but their fungus resistance appears to be spreading to 
other chestnuts 
the treatment involves injecting the trees with a mixture 
imported from europe of a viruslike substance and the killing 
fungus the substance doesnt kill the fungus but makes it less 
effective sort of a vaccination 
i think we have a real phenomena i think we have the spread of 
a biological control said sandra l anagnostakis who has studied 
the american chestnut for more than 20 years but how far will it 
go 
anagnostakis speculates that insects animals or people are 
spreading the weakened fungus to other trees allowing them to 
survive too 
a control for the fungus could add a new chapter to the story of 
one of the great environmental disasters of modern time 
american chestnuts once grew from georgia to maine their 
dominance in the woods made them prized for food and wood and 
because all but the oldest trees put out new sprouts when cut 
replanting wasnt required after harvesting 
but in 1904 the chestnuts that lined the avenues in new york 
citys bronx zoo began to wilt and die from a fungus that couldnt 
be stopped 
the infection was insidious and the fungus was able to spread 
out very rapidly from its apparent start in the new york area 
anagnostakis said 
by the 1950s all mature chestnuts in the native range were wiped 
out an estimated 35 billion trees 
anagnostakis suspects that the fungus cryphonectria parasitica 
was brought into this country with asian chestnut trees from japan 
or china at the turn of the century but it causes few problems for 
asian chestnuts possibly because the fungus and asian chestnuts 
evolved together 
the american chestnut is a different species she said it 
had never been exposed and was almost completely susceptible its 
partly because of that that we now have plant quarantine laws 
scientists have been able to study american chestnuts because the 
trees produce sprouts from stumps or old root systems the fungus 
doesnt penetrate below ground and into the roots so the trees can 
grow as large as six inches in diameter before the fungus infects 
and kills them 
the fungus usually enters a tree through a broken branch or a 
break in the bark it then grows through the cambium the growing 
tissue that produces bark and wood and eventually pushes through 
the bark to appear as orange blotches 
the blotches produce spores that help spread the fungus 
european chestnuts are similar to american and also are 
susceptible to the fungus which was first reported overseas in 
italy in 1938 it began to spread rapidly but within 15 years a 
variation was discovered in italy that was less virulent and 
appeared to stop the killing blight when the two came together 
french scientists jean grente and suzanne sauret began studying 
the less deadly strains known as hypovirulents 
in 1972 anagnostakis got a sample scientists here found that 
the hypovirulents interfered with the blight and produced white 
rather than orange blotches she said they havent identified the 
hypovirulence but that it acts like a virus and contains 
doublestranded ribonucleic acid 
there are varieties of the hypovirulents and aside from the 
european type others have been found in michigan virginia and 
tennessee she said theres really nothing that describes what it 
really fits into 
in 1978 researchers introduced the italian strain in test sites 
in goodwin state forest in hampton and on private land in pomfret 
and anagnostakis has tested different mixtures of it at other sites 
across the state 
in all cases the trees seem to be surviving and the 
hypovirulents are spreading the treated trees dont grow straight 
and tall like their ancestors and probably never will because the 
hypovirulents create cankers big knots of bark that grow on the 
trees she said the cankers dont kill the trees 
anagnostakis research is unfinished but she is guardedly 
optimistic about the biological control in our woodlands

american and european scientists using a 
modern version of the u2 spy plane are setting out to explore 
troubling signs of ozone loss high over the arctic 
the project organized by the national aeronautics and space 
administration runs from jan 1 to midfebruary the period when a 
hole apparently opens up in the protective ozone layer at the top of 
the world 
most of the scientists are veterans of a 1987 expedition that 
documented an ozone hole over antarctica during the southern winter 
the ozone hole over antarctica is something you cant miss 
said dr adrian tuck a chemist and meteorologist we did come up 
with an unequivocal answer that the ozone hole was indeed caused by 
manmade chemicals and a natural question to ask is is it 
possible in the arctic 
scientists fear that the loss of ozone a gas which filters the 
suns harmful ultraviolet rays is leading to increased skin cancer 
and eye damage and could upset the food chain by harming many 
species of plants and animals 
dr darrell s rigel a us dermatologist recently reported a 
1500 percent increase in melanoma a form of skin cancer in the 
united states since 1935 with more people contracting the disease 
at a younger age 
tuck and other scientists gathering at sola a norwegian air 
force base here said the arctic hole appeared to be smaller than 
the southern one but could be more serious because it is closer to 
where people live 
if the changes occur they could probably have an effect over a 
much larger area due to the difference in meteorology said ivar 
isaksen a professor at the university of oslo theres a much 
larger exchange of air 
the idea here is to look at what happens not only in the 
vortex but what consequences it could have for the ozone at lower 
latitudes 
the vortex is a circulation of strong westerly winds in the polar 
region 
the scientists will analyze clouds about 12 miles up that in a 
manner that was completely unpredicted can intervene in the 
chemistry change the chemical balance and make it easier for the 
chlorine from refrigerants and aerosol can sprays and so on to 
destroy the ozone said tuck 
four pilots will take turns flying through the clouds in a 
singleengine er2 an updated model u2 loaded with scientific 
instruments a modified dc8 airliner will look at the clouds from 
below with lasers and other instruments 
the missions will mostly be north and west of norway but will 
avoid soviet air space said pilot jim barrileaux of dublin calif 
he said the soviets might be sending up research flights of their 
own over northern siberia 
the norwegian air force cleared out a sprawling hangar at its 
seaside base to make room for the er2 an advance team nailed 
together sheetrock partitions as temporary offices and computer 
experts patched together a network for data analysis and weather 
reports beamed down by satellite 
it could take as long as a year to analyze the data and publish a 
full report said estelle condon the project manager 
worry about ozone depletion led last year to industrial nations 
signing a treaty to reduce the use of the chloroflourocarbon 
chemicals that are primary suspects in ozone destruction further 
steps are under consideration 
we have information from the southern hemisphere and so we 
would like information from the northern hemisphere so when the 
negotiations take place they have the best information possible to 
make the decisions said condon 
the projects 10 million budget is not very big by nasa 
standards she said up to 150 scientists will take part most of 
them from the united states britain norway and west germany also 
are represented 
the missions success will depend largely on the weather said 
tuck the clouds could drift over the soviet union or they may not 
form at all though 1985 was the only year in the past decade when 
that happened so if this is a horse race he said youre 
backing odds of 10 to 1

im going to get a motor car im going to 
learn how to drive says bruce quinn 32 years old and legally 
blind 
quinn who expects by summer to run two radio stations 50 miles 
apart in northern indiana may be licensed to drive for the first 
time using glasses equipped with small telescopes to spot details 
like signs and lights 
im excited about it i got a moped a few years ago and ive 
had a lot of fun with it and never any trouble so i should be all 
right said quinn of delphi it offers me a lot of 
opportunities something called freedom 
california and texas have been licensing bioptic drivers for more 
than 10 years and about 25 states have such programs for as many as 
2000 nationwide said warren brown indiana bureau of motor 
vehicles director of licensing 
optometrist paul bither who helped write indianas licensing 
guidelines says not everyone is suited for the program getting a 
license is a major step toward independence but its not 
something that i push he said 
in indiana bioptic drivers must have vision correctable to 
20200 in glasses 2040 through the telescopes with up to 4x 
magnification a horizontal visual field of 130 degrees and no major 
blind spots color defects or other visual problems they must be 
evaluated and fit for the telescope get a sixmonth learners 
permit and training available only in south bend indianapolis and 
evansville and pass a road test 
the telescopes cost 500 to more than 2000 they vary in size 
and weight but the most common are about an inch in diameter and 
about 6 ounces they may extend a few inches at a slight angle 
upward from the top of the glasses over the users strongest eye or 
in some cases both when the user needs to see some detail he tilts 
his head forward to look through the scope 
dr gerald fonda a livingston nj ophthalmologist whos been 
prescribing bioptic glasses since 1947 said bioptic drivers need at 
least three seconds to adjust to looking through the telescope spot 
the detail and then readjust to looking through normal glasses he 
said the telescope creates a blind spot that is twice as wide as the 
field of vision through the scope 
a 1983 study of bioptic drivers in california showed they were 
nearly twice as likely as the general driving population to have an 
accident said bill gengler spokesman for that states department 
of motor vehicles 
despite the accident rate advocates claim bioptic drivers are 
among the most careful on the road bioptics say they know their 
limitations and wont exceed them or else risk losing part of their 
independence

american chestnuts could once again line 
eastern avenues if an experimental vaccination technique proves 
successful against the fungus that devastated the stately trees 
three decades ago 
two stands of trees treated 10 years ago by the connecticut 
agricultural experiment station are not only thriving and producing 
tasty nuts but their fungus resistance appears to be spreading to 
other chestnuts 
the treatment involves injecting the trees with a mixture 
imported from europe of a viruslike substance and the killing 
fungus the substance doesnt kill the fungus but makes it less 
effective sort of a vaccination 
i think we have a real phenomena i think we have the spread of 
a biological control said sandra l anagnostakis who has studied 
the american chestnut for more than 20 years but how far will it 
go 
anagnostakis speculates that insects animals or people are 
spreading the weakened fungus to other trees allowing them to 
survive too 
a control for the fungus could add a new chapter to the story of 
one of the great environmental disasters of modern time 
american chestnuts once grew from georgia to maine but in 1904 
the chestnuts that lined the avenues in new york citys bronx zoo 
began to wilt and die from a fungus that couldnt be stopped by the 
1950s all mature chestnuts in the native range were wiped out 35 
billion trees 
european chestnuts are similar to american and also are 
susceptible to the fungus cryphonectria parasitica which was first 
reported overseas in italy in 1938 it spread but within 15 years a 
variation was discovered in italy that was less virulent and 
appeared to stop the killing blight 
french scientists jean grente and suzanne sauret began studying 
the less deadly strains known as hypovirulents 
in 1978 researchers introduced the italian strain in test sites 
in connecticut the trees seem to be surviving and the hypovirulents 
spreading

the persistent beeping of pocket pagers has become 
too common in many big hospitals taking doctors away from their 
patients to deal with questions that are not really urgent a new 
study concludes 
beepers have largely replaced overhead paging systems among the 
most frequent targets of the beepers are interns the young doctors 
who provide much of the care in large hospitals 
in a study at three hospitals affiliated with the university of 
california san francisco drs mitchell h katz and steven a 
schroeder persuaded 26 interns to keep logs of their beeper calls 
the interns were paged an average of once an hour however on 24 
occasions interns were paged five or more times an hour one 
unfortunate intern got eight calls in a single hour the figures 
probably underestimate the frequency of pages some interns said 
they had to stop keeping logs because they were too busy answering 
pages 
only about onethird of the pages were for truly urgent matters 
requiring immediate changes in patient care most concerned matters 
that could have been put off until later some were entirely 
unnecessary 
for instance one intern was beeped awake to evaluate a patient 
whose mental status had changed 
on arrival the doctors wrote the intern learned that the 
patient appeared drowsy because he had been asleep like the intern 
when the nurse evaluated him 
the doctors said recently in the new england journal of medicine 
that a few changes such as relying more on written notes and 
grouping several nonurgent pages together could reduce the paging 
interruptions up to 42 percent

the national institute of mental health 
has given yale school of medicine researchers 66 million to study 
schizophrenia which affects an estimated one person in 10 at some 
point in life 
schizophrenia usually begins with an apparent personality change 
that may include social withdrawal difficulty in communicating and 
lethargy later in its more active phase it can make victims see 
hallucinations and hear voices 
they may feel controlled by invisible agents or believe their 
thoughts are being broadcast to others they may adopt new 
identities 
the research will be guided by the concept that the mental 
disorder rises from physical rather than purely psychological 
problems said patricia s goldmanrakic a neuroscience professor 
who will direct the study 
the center for neuroscience research underscores the modern 
conception of the disease as having an organic basis that affects 
the highest center of the brain the cerebral cortex where the 
functions of perception memory and thinking are carried out 
goldmanrakic said

the us environmental protection agency has 
picked the university of pittsburgh to open the nations first 
center to speed commercial development of pollution control 
technology 
us industry and government spent nearly 80 billion in 1987 for 
pollution controls and the cost of cleaning hazardous waste sites 
is estimated at more than 200 billion over the next 20 years pitt 
said in a statement 
the national environmental technology applications corporation 
will be a positive force for changing the way government and 
industry work together in the environmental area said epa 
administrator lee thomas 
pitt president wesley w posvar said it is clear that to bring 
environmental technology out of the laboratory and into the 
marketplace with the approval of government a strong publicprivate 
sector partnership is required netac will help forge that 
partnership 
epa and pitt will each pay half of the centers operating 
expenses of 9 million over its first three years netac is expected 
to be in operation within two years at the universitys applied 
research center in harmarville 
the federal technology transfer act of 1986 encourages the 
government and companies to cooperate in moving new technologies to 
market 
pitt two years ago formed the center for hazardous materials

a researcher has developed a flexible wire that 
carries electrical current without resistance a step toward 
practical use of recently developed hightemperature superconducting 
materials 
scientists had previously produced only rigid superconducting 
wire 
flexible wire may be useful in coils to store electricity 
magnets and magnetic resonance imaging systems which create images 
of the bodys interior without xrays said shyam samanta of the 
university of michigan 
superconductivity is the ability to carry current without 
resistance scientists hope superconductors will lead to such 
products as more powerful computers and floating highspeed trains 
as in other superconductor developments the term high is 
relative the new wire must be chilled to work tests on a 
halfinchlong piece found it lost electrical resistance at 321 
degrees below zero fahrenheit samanta said 
the wire oneeighthinch in diameter is based on a standard 
superconducting compound of yttrium barium copper and oxygen the 
compound is normally brittle but a flexible wire was produced by 
adding silver and silver oxide samanta said 
researchers do not yet know how much electrical current the wire 
can carry he said in a recent telephone interview 
until that is known the usefulness of the wire cannot be 
assessed said roger poeppel of the argonne national laboratory in 
argonne ill where rigid wire has been developed other 
researchers have produced wirelike silver tubes with a core of 
superconducting powder poeppel said but he did not know how 
flexible the tubes were

holidays 
the dollar closed at 12472 yen down 023 yen from fridays 
close of 12495 yen after opening higher at 12485 yen the 
currency edged down ranging between 12463 yen and 12490 yen 
dealers said market players were reluctant to make major moves 
without knowing trends on overseas markets closed until tuesday for 
the christmas holiday 
there was hardly any activity in the market said a dealer 
with mitsubishi bank in tokyo 
on the stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average rose 
18165 points or 061 percent following saturdays 010point 
gain and closed at 2986865 the index gained 8602 points in 
early morning trading and continued to rise 
dealers said stability in the currency market contributed to the 
nikkeis rise 
after a fullday session tuesday and a halfday session 
wednesday the stock market is to close until jan 4 for the new 
year holidays 
a dealer at daiwa securities said many investors were trying to 
avoid holding many issues ahead of the sixday holidays mainly 
because of uncertainty over emperor hirohitos condition 
the 87yearold emperor has been bedridden with internal 
hemorrhaging since sept 19 and his death would lead to a further 
closing of the stock market 
another dealer with a major securities firm in tokyo said trading 
remained inactive in the afternoon as a majority of institutional 
investors remained on the sidelines 
it was mostly individual investors buy orders for steel 
shipbuilding and financial issues that boosted the nikkei index he 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
volume traded on the first section was estimated at 600 million

small mountains of newspapers are 
swallowing up joseph giordanos recycling yard forcing him to post 
a handprinted sign 
not accepting newspaper until further notice 
the small cardboard announcement is bad news for local 
municipalities trying to comply with the states mandatory recycling 
laws enacted in april 1987 the sign in giordanos yard is 
indicative of a newspaper glut in the recycling business 
im limited in places where i can sell it he said i cant 
sell newsprint to a tissue mill because its not a soft paper all 
overseas markets have put their orders on hold 
aletha spang acting administrator in the states office of 
recycling said paper dealers warned us that this could happen 
our feeling was that with a strong export market there 
wouldnt be a problem she said 
foreign countries especially in asia have traditionally 
recycled us newspapers into paperboard that may return to the 
united states in the form of boxes for cameras and vcrs but within 
the past few months the bottom has fallen out of the export market 
the export market has gotten smart ms spang said they 
know the paper is going to come regardless of what they have to 
pay 
new jersey the first state to impose a mandatory recycling 
program in recent weeks has experienced the dilemma of what to do 
with massive volumes of waste and not enough recycling facilities 
you can mandate collection but the state cant mandate making 
it into a new product ms spang said thats part of the 
marketplace 
she tried to be optimistic sayingwere hoping this glut is 
just temporary 
but giordano was blunt about the prospects these newspapers 
are probably going to end up in the dump 
j rodney edwards vice president in charge of recycling for the 
american paper institute in new york said that while there is 
mandatory collection of newspapers it doesnt necessarily mean 
mandatory recycling 
the capacity to use all the newspapers we recycle is limited by 
the number of recycling mills he said 
the mountains of old newspapers are getting so high that 
municipalities may soon have to pay recyclers to take the papers 
away said james l burke an executive vice president of garden 
state paper 
when mandatory recycling first came on line people thought it 
would be a moneymaking program for their towns he said but 
the majority of paper collected from municipalities is of lower 
quality than we get from volunteers its filled with mailers 
gummed labels and other contaminants 
we have to put money and labor into cleaning it up so we may 
have to charge to take it he said 
burke noted however it may still be cheaper for municipalities 
to pay recycling companies to take the papers away 
if tipping fees at the dump are 100 a ton and we charge a 
modest 10 a ton we may still be a good deal he said 
john haas recycling coordinator for ocean county said most 
newspapers are now sent to the garden state plant at a profit but 
there are concerns about the future 
were noticing whats happening in other parts of the state 
and were all affected by the same market forces he said 
giordano called on state officials to deal with the problem 
the states need to put more pressure on the mills to force them 
to buy more recycling material and stop using fibers from trees and 
plants he said 
the solid waste problem is economical social and political 
and its going to take good political leadership to address the 
problem properly he said

ask mr foster travel founded 100 years ago 
by a knowitall who insisted his shops be run by single women is 
targeting the european market after being refueled by two new owners 
in the past 15 years 
the nations oldest travel agency ask mr foster was on the 
decline in 1972 when it was purchased by a los angeles travel 
company headed by peter ueberroth who went on to organize the los 
angeles olympic games and become commissioner of major league 
baseball 
the company is now the major component in the 3 billion carlson 
travel group the travel arm of minnesota millionaire curt carlsons 
conglomerate carlson cos 
there were 29 ask mr foster branch offices when ueberroth bought 
the company for 1 million and hired his brother john to help 
direct an expansion 
when carlson bought the company from peter ueberroth in 1979 for 
an undisclosed sum it had more than 100 branches and more than 100 
million in annual revenue 
john ueberroth joined carlson when the company was sold and 
continued expanding ask mr foster into one of the continents 
largest travel agencies with more than 800 offices the travel 
retail network of new yorkbased american expres also has more than 
800 offices in the united states and canada 
john ueberroth now president of carlson travel based in the 
minneapolis suburb of plymouth has said sales in his group will 
double by 1992 to 6 billion besides ask mr foster the group 
includes p lawson travel of canada neimanmarcus travel and 
carlson wholesale vacations 
the overseas expansion will initially include contracts with 
businessoriented travel agencies in 20 to 30 major european and 
asian cities before ask mr foster was revived by the ueberroths 
and carlson it was losing market share and name recognition during 
the 1960s because it was undercapitalized and overmatched in an 
industry that was on the rise the company said 
it had turned into something far different than ward grenelle 
foster who some call the father of the travel agency in north 
america envisioned when he opened his first shop in st augustine 
fla in 1888 
fosters penchant for travel grew during his confinement as child 
in a new york tuberculosis sanatorium he developed a passion for 
travel literature of any kind and became known as a walking 
encyclopedia in st augustine when visitors to americas oldest 
city had a question that inn keepers couldnt answer they were told 
to ask mr foster 
foster began by printing information guides to various cities 
and by the 1920s his travel service included 70 offices throughout 
by us 
genevieve kenna 87 of melbourne fla lived through the 
changes as one of the companys original foster girls foster 
himself chose kenna and others because they were single 
courteous interested patient conscientious and above all 
enthusiastic in helping people 
we tried men at first but they are not up to it foster said 
in a 1924 article about his company women are more interested in 
the problems that come to them and have more graciousness in their 
attitude toward people 
women still outnumber men at the travel agent level but men 
began working as agents for ask mr foster in the 1940s said janis 
chamoun a spokeswoman for the company 
ms kenna who worked for the company from 19281971 said 
traveling was always an important part of the job 
we learned by seeing so that we could say which cities and 
hotels were nice to visit said ms kenna a native of st paul 
she said foster was the super salesman of all time 
frequently traveling more than 50000 miles a year foster owned 
the company until 1937 when he sold it to detroit native paxton 
mendelssohn a millionaire heir of the fisher family who had to deal 
with a set of worldwide events that greatly changed the travel 
business 
the outbreak of world war ii curtailed domestic travel and the 
rail lines were forced to cancel their contracts with ask mr 
foster it wasnt until 10 years of depression and four years of war 
had passed that the american public took to the road again this 
time in unprecedented numbers 
with the demand for rail service so great the railroads canceled 
their advertising contracts with ask mr foster and the feebased 
travel agency business gradually turned to commissions as its prime 
source of revenue the process was accelerated with the popularity 
of air travel in the 1950s 
in 1957 the company was purchased by two ask mr foster 
shareholders they sold it to ueberroths company in 1972 after 
operations continued to sag 
under carlson ask mr foster has grown eightfold under an 
aggressive expansion mode in september for example carlson 
purchased gelco travel management service inc from gelco corp to 
expand ask mr foster by 83 offices 
many of the travel agencies are owned by the parent company but 
others are owned by franchisees chamoun said

mexico may no longer be a major exporter of 
oil by the end of the century unless new crude deposits are found 
because domestic consumption continues to rise the mexican 
petroleum institute said monday 
the institute said in a report the state petroleum monopoly pemex 
will have to cut down on exports and increase current proven 
reserves by at least 125 billion barrels during the next 11 years 
just to keep up with growing domestic demand 
mexicos total energy consumption is currently equivalent to 
2325 million barrels of crude oil daily 80 percent of which is 
made up of petroleum and the rest is generated by hydroelectric 
plants according to the report 
this could go up to the equivalent of 37 million barrels daily 
by the year 2000 and to 59 million barrels by the year 2010 the 
institute said 
the countrys proven oil reserves currently stand at about 72 
billion barrels of crude it produces 25 million barrels daily and 
sells 1325 million barrrels mostly to the united states making it 
the worlds sixth largest exporter

japans economy which has already been expanding 
for 25 months will continue to grow in 1989 the economic planning 
agency predicted monday 
in its 1988 report on japans economy the agency said domestic 
demand continued to spur growth and help reduce the countrys large 
trade surplus 
it said there was nothing in sight in the country itself that 
could retard economic growth predicting that the economy will 
maintain smooth growth with personal spending and corporate 
capital investment as the engine 
however the agency stressed the need for astute management of 
fiscal and monetary policies and steppedup efforts to ease various 
restrictions open markets and cut the trade surplus 
the report also said it was necessary for japan to coordinate 
policies with other major industrial countries to head off inflation 
the government has set an inflationadjusted growth goal of 38 
percent for fiscal 1988 which ends march 31 but most economists 
have said an expansion of more than 5 percent was possible because 
of the present robust domestic demand 
at present the agency report noted corporate capital spending 
was mainly fueling growth pushing up production and spurring 
consumption through creation of more jobs and higher income this 
in turn was prompting corporations to pour more money into the 
improvement of production and other facilities 
the agency shrugged off worries among some economists about 
excessive production pointing out that much of the equipment 
investment was going into research and development that does not 
lead immediately to an increase in production

reebok known for its popular leather athletic footwear had a 
more than 200 percent average return on equity during the last four 
years with a 277 percent return over the past 12 months according 
to forbes which compiled its annual listing of the nations most 
profitable firms 
the business magazine tallied firms return on equity the 
measure of how much a corporation earns on its shareholders 
investments over the last three to five years forbes listed 1116 
companies in its rankings which are being published in the 
magazines jan 9 issue 
right behind canton massbased reebok was delta woodside 
industries a greenville scbased fabric and apparel maker with 
a more than 200 percent return on equity over the past three years 
and a 378 percent return in the last year 
third on the list was centrust savings bank a miamibased 
savings and loan company with a 1506 percent return over four 
years and a 67 percent return in the most recent 12 months 
no 4 was anchor glass container of tampa fla which had a

past 12 months 
in fifth place was jepson corp a consumer and industrial 
products company with a 944 percent return over three years and a 
193 percent return in the last 12 months 
the least profitable company in the nation was public service of 
new hampshire which had a 02 percent return in the past five 
years with a loss in the most recent year forbes also listed 175 
companies which had losses for their fiveyear average returns or 
for which threetofive year figures were not available 
because the rankings consider a companys aggregate performance 
over several years some of the companies with recent profit

litigation will always be the bedrock of the 
american judicial system but many businesses are deciding its not 
for them 
more and more companies that cant resolve their differences by 
negotiation are submitting them to impartial arbitrators who weigh 
both sides and hand down binding decisions 
commercial arbitration cases rose 84 percent from 1983 to last 
year and are still increasing the american arbitration association 
says 
arbitration makes sense in many situations it saves time and 
money and puts complex matters in the hands of trained experts 
instead of untrained unpredictable judges or juries 
the idea of asking 12 uneducated uninformed jurors to try to 
decide an issue that is complex and requires technical training and 
experience in an industry it just doesnt make sense said 
robert coulson president of the arbitration association 
in arbitration coulson said you can pick an arbitrator whos 
expert on the industry or patent law or whatever aspect of 
technical information that is relevant to the case 
arbitration gained credibility when computer rivals international 
business machines corp and fujitsu ltd used it to end a bitter 
dispute over ibms copyrights on mainframe computer software 
ibm has a glorious history of victories in the legal system so 
some analysts said it was foolish of the company to surrender so 
much control over its future to a law professor and a retired 
railroad executive whose judgments are impossible to appeal 
but choosing arbitration probably shaved tens or hundreds of 
millions of dollars from ibms and fujitsus legal fees while 
removing crippling uncertainty over the terms of their competition 
even patent lawyers like the trend mainly because they are so 
overworked they dont mind the competition from arbitrators juries 
simply cant grasp many patent issues said michael blommer 
executive director of the american intellectual property law 
association 
when the constitution was written there werent cases like 
this where the average man couldnt understand the facts blommer 
said 
that was before the days of biotechnology and microelectronics 
in a complex patent case today blommer said if under 
crossexamination somebody is forced to recant or change his 
position the jury might not understand that he even is changing his 
position 
federal judges do a little better but not many of them studied 
science or engineering either the judiciary took a step in the 
right direction in 1982 by sending all patent appeals to the federal 
circuit in washington where many judges are highly trained and have 
expert clerks 
actually most arbitration is on matters other than intellectual 
property disputes labor grievances account for about a third of the 
american arbitration associations business other big areas are 
construction contracts disputes between stockbrokers and clients 
insurance claims and supervision of elections of private 
organizations 
many contracts are being written to include provisions that any 
disputes over them will be submitted to arbitration 
nonbinding arbitration where decisions can be appealed to the 
courts is also growing in popularity the better business bureau 
does it so does the insurance industry courts in 20 to 25 states 
and 10 federal districts have annexes that do arbitration to clear 
out cases that dont need to go before a judge or jury 
trials particularly trials by juries clearly have a place 
criminal cases are obviously not suited to arbitration arbitrators 
are also unsuited to try cases where major societal questions are at 
stake such as the round of lawsuits against cigarette companies 
over health damage from smoking 
even in areas where arbitration is wellsuited there is a cost 
in civil liberties the state of massachusetts in a first is 
trying to prohibit stockbrokers from requiring that their clients 
agree ahead of time to settle disputes by arbitration 
a federal judge last week threw out massachusetts regulatory 
effort but the state vowed to appeal 
compulsory arbitration or arbitration agreements entered into 
by citizens who do not recognize they are forfeiting their 
constitutional right to trial by jury is counter to the american 
system of fair play the association of trial lawyers of america 
said 
americans have not lost their taste for suing the living 
daylights out of each other clearly though arbitration has plenty 
of room to grow 
its exciting to let people take control of their own disputes 
and use their innovation and ideas to resolve them in a practical 
way coulson said
