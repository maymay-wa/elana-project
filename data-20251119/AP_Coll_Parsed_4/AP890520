china declared martial law in parts of the 
capital saturday to crack down on hundreds of thousands of people 
demonstrating for political reform the government sent in troops 
but residents blocked army trucks and some soldiers turned back 
waving victory signs 
martial law began at 10 am 9 pm edt friday in eight 
districts in the central city including tiananmen square the 
center of the protests no curfew was imposed and no date was 
given for lifting martial law 
shortly after martial law took effect military helicopters were 
seen flying over the 100acre square 
abcs nightline reported that witnesses had seen police 
clubbing protesters 
the protesters thousands of them on a hunger strike have 
occupied tiananmen square for a week demanding talks with the 
government a free press and an end to official corruption 
three tanks just south of the square were being blocked by buses 
deliberately placed across the road by protesters no troops were 
seen in the square but medical workers were distributing gauze in 
case of a tear gas attack 
premier li peng said the protesters threatened communist party 
rule and were being manipulated by people who wanted to overthrow 
the government 
communist party chief zhao ziyang who opposed a crackdown 
offered to resign but the party had not acted on his offer sources 
said 
the englishlanguage china daily still referred to zhao in 
saturdays edition as party general secretary a reporter said he 
did not know about zhaos political status but had heard he was 
sick 
it appeared clear however that the moderate zhao had lost out 
to the hardline li in the governments decision to confront the 
protesting students 
the official xinhua news agency said li signed the martial law 
order to put an end to serious turmoil that destroyed 
peoples life and social order 
beijing mayor chen xitong signed six measures forbidding 
marches strikes class boycotts distribution of pamphlets 
spreading rumors attacks on leaders and media outlets and any 
other destructive actions 
chen said soldiers were authorized to take any measures 
necessary to maintain order in the city of 10 million 
in a separate order he said foreign reporters were forbidden to 
incite or instigate chinese to to march and could not conduct 
interviews or make tapes or videos on the streets or at government 
offices schools factories and mines any violators will be 
stopped according to the law the order said 
the government ordered the cable news network to halt 
transmissions and the network had to end its coverage at about 
1010 pm edt cbs and abc also said officials cut off their 
transmissions 
cnn reported that even china central television the staterun 
network had been shut down after the martiallaw order was 
broadcast 
it was the first time martial law was declared in beijing since 
communist china was founded in 1949 beijing becomes the second 
city under martial law lhasa capital of tibet has been under 
martial law since march after antichinese riots 
soldiers began moving into the city from the east and west 
before dawn but thousands of local residents poured into the 
streets to surround troop trucks they parked factory trucks and 
buses across key intersections to serve as barriers lifted lane 
dividers across the road and at some places formed human barricades 
we are people and you are people why do you have no 
feelings one demonstrator shouted at the troopers 
military helicopters made repeated low runs over the city a 
rare sight 
about 15 trucks each filled with about two dozen soldiers 
turned around and drove back the way they came after about 500 
students and supporters surrounded them for several hours in 
western beijing and urged them to leave 
you should think about what you are doing one young man 
said earnestly standing on a trucks rear bumper and looking in 
the faces of about a dozen soldiers no weapons were visible 
when the trucks turned around the crowd cheered and some 
soldiers smiled waved and flashed vforvictory signs 
more than 200 trucks and 50 vans filled with soldiers still 
stood further down the road to the west blocked by thousands of 
protesters about 10 sat on the east side of the city but a bus 
parked across the road blocked the way 
president yang shangkun said the armys task was to protect 
important ministries and key installations 
zhao was not visible in the audience as li and yang announced 
the troop deployment in a nationally televised address also not 
shown was senior leader deng xiaoping 84 believed to be the main 
force behind the crackdown 
after lis announcement some students at tiananmen square said 
they would resume a weekold hunger strike which had been called 
off late friday 
leaders said 200000 demonstrators would participate but many 
were seen eating after the announcement 
demonstrating students said they would remain passive if 
soldiers tried to move them and would continue their sitin until 
the government agrees to a dialogue on reforms 
about 100000 people were in the square and an equal number 
filled nearby streets women cried men yelled and loudspeakers 
blared police sirens wailed throughout the city and one police 
vehicle chased several trucks of bannerwaving student supporters 
li announced the armys intervention in a speech to military and 
civilian officials at the great hall of the people which looks out 
on the square 
we must adopt firm and resolute measures to end the turmoil 
swiftly maintain the leadership of the party as well as the 
socialist system li said speaking in an agitated manner and 
occasionally waving his fist he said beijing was in a state of 
anarchy 
the student protests which began in midapril have evolved 
into a nationwide movement and represent the biggest show of 
defiance in chinas 40 years of communist rule they overshadowed 
this weeks historic visit by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the students in the square drowned out the broadcast of pengs 
speech by singing the internationale the worldwide socialist 
anthem they also chanted li peng step down 
beijing university students began protesting for democracy on 
april 15 after former communist party chief hu yaobang died he 
was ousted in 1987 for failing to crack down on earlier student 
dmonstrations 
nonstudents cheered the initial protests but relatively few 
took part in the marches until the hunger strike began a week ago 
then fearful for the students lives and angered by the 
governments refusal to talk to them people from every walk of 
life joined in 
soldiers and police marched with the doctors teachers factory 
workers schoolchildren and dancing troupes 
protests also broke out in more than 20 other cities the 
largest marches outside beijing were in shanghai 
an american witness said about 500000 students and workers 
marched friday in shanghai and that more than 500 students were on 
a hunger strike there

brewing is financed by a grant from the nonprofit international 
coffee organization which is dedicated to increasing us coffee 
consumption 
coffee has become a big deal recently eidel said for 
one the consumption of coffee has fallen in the us over the last 
10 years

blends in an effort to increase demand eidel said

flavored coffees such as hazelnut he said coffee is usually 
the last item served with a dinner so it is the most important

in the middle of the square is the monument to the heroes of the 
revolution 
at the south end are the mausoleum where mao tsetung lies in 
state and qianmen or front gate to the forbidden city a kind

architecture the great hall of the people and the museum of 
chinese history and the revolution 
to the north across the sixlane changan avenue is the

family 
in normal times tiananmen is a favorite spot for chinese 
accustomed to cramped quarters to take a leisurely stroll under 
wideopen skies the square is always crowded with tourists from 
outside beijing families on sunday outings or young couples 
it also brings people together in times of turmoil or 
celebration a million people were said to have crammed into the 
square on several occasions during the radical leftist 196676

here are excerpts translated by the official 
xinhua news agency from a speech by premier li peng about the 
student demonstrations 
the capital is in a critical situation the anarchic state is 
going from bad to worse and law and discipline are being violated 
more and more students and other people were involved in 
demonstrations and many colleges and universities had come to a 
standstill traffic jams took place everywhere the party and 
government offices were affected and public security was 
deteriorating 
some activities on the agenda of the sinosoviet summit that 
attracted worldwide attention had to be cancelled greatly damaging 
chinas international image and prestige 
actually a handful of persons are using the hunger strikers as 
hostages to coerce and force the party and the government to 
yield to their political demands in this regard they have no iota 
of humanism the party and the government have on one hand taken 
every possible measure to treat and rescue the fasting students on 
the other hand they have held several dialogues with 
representatives of the fasting students and have earnestly promised 
to continue to listen to their opinions in the future 
the situation in beijing is still worsening and has already 
affected many other cities in the country in places the number of 
demonstrators and protesters is increasing in some places there 
have occurred many incidents in which people broke into local party 
and government organs along with beating smashing looting 
burnings and other undermining activities that seriously violated 
the law 
all these have shown that this will lead to a nationwide turmoil 
if no quick action is taken to turn and stabilize the situation 
the nations reforms and opening to the outside world and the fate 
and future of the peoples republic are facing serious threat 
the party and government have pointed out time and again that 
the students are kindhearted and they do not want to create 
turmoil instead these patriotic students hope to promote 
democracy and overcome corruption and this is in line with the 
goals the party and government have strived to achieve 
now it has become more and more clear that the very few people 
who attempt to create turmoil want to reach their political goals 
negating the leadership of the communist party of china and the 
socialist system and violating the democratic and legal channels 
they spread rumors and smear and hurt party and government leaders 
they concentrate their attack on comrade deng xiaoping who has 
made great contributions to chinas opening to the outside world 
their purpose is to overthrow the peoples government elected 
by the national peoples congress and totally negate the peoples 
democratic dictatorship 
under such circumstances we are forced to take resolute and 
decisive measures to put an end to the turmoil 
i urgently appeal on behalf of the party central committee and 
the state council to those students now on hunger strike in 
tiananmen square to end the fasting immediately leave the square 
receive medical treatment and recover their health as soon as 
possible to students and people in all walks of life to 
immediately stop all demonstrations and give no more socalled 
support to the fasting students in the interest of humanitarianism 
whatever the intent further support will push the fasting 
students to desperation 
i now call on the whole party the whole army and the whole 
nation to make concerted efforts and act immediately at all posts 
so as to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation 
comrades our party is a party in power and our government a 
peoples government to be responsible to our sacred motherland and 
to the entire chinese people we must adopt firm and resolute 
measures to end the turmoil swiftly maintain the leadership of the 
party as well as the socialist system 
we also hope the people in the capital will fully support the 
peoples liberation army police and armed police in their efforts 
to maintain order in the capital

the british columbia 
legislature has been saved from an 11th consecutive summer of 
seemingly nonstop bagpipe serenades by a street musician 
the city council recently passed a resolution requiring street 
performers to move at least two blocks after each threehour set 
the action has drawn mixed reviews with officials who said fred 
tarasoffs music gets on their nerves applauding the decision and 
others saying you cannot get enough of a good thing 
itll be a great relief to all of us in the front of the 
building finance minister mel couvelier said thursday 
but regional development minister elwood veitch who has one of 
the closest offices to the piper is on tarasoffs side listen 
ive got scottish blood coursing through my veins even when 
bagpipes are played offchord if thats possible i still love 
them 
tarasoff who has a doctorate in zoology each morning commutes 
to a corner a caber toss from the legislature and plays until late 
afternoon weather permitting 
a letter from the caucus staff of the new democratic party 
prompted the council to look at limiting tarasoffs time alderman 
eric simmons said the complaints arose because the music was 
incessant 
i guess it gets a little upsetting he said 
victoria new democrat robin blencoe called the bylaw a 
reasonable compromise between leaving tarasoff alone or closing him 
down 
as far as i know tourists like him i dont think everybody 
is against him blencoe said 
tarasoff said he is keeping his options open 
one ndp caucus staff member who declined to be identified said 
if tarasoff is so good he should be shared with the rest of the 
city hes got a monopoly on the corner and you cant get rid of 
him hes driving me crazy

a flood of complaints has forced the 
government to withdraw a plan to cut back on federal inspections at 
plants that turn out hot dogs chicken soup and other processed 
foods using meat and poultry 
but officials of the agriculture department left open the 
possibility they would revive the proposal later on and a meat 
industry spokesman said a consensus might be sought 
since the proposal was announced in november there have been 
many complaints that it would put greater reliance on the plants 
themselves to meet federal inspection standards 
lester m crawford head of the departments food safety and 
inspection service said the proposal would have allowed for 
varying the intensity of inspection at meat and poultry 
processing plants according to a plants ability to consistently 
produce safe and wholesome product in a sanitary environment 
crawford said the proposal was withdrawn at least for the time 
being in direct response to more than 1800 comments from the 
public since it was announced last fall most opposed all or parts 
of the proposal he said the agency will gather additional 
information and then determine if a new plan will be drafted 
the withdrawal applied only to the socalled improved processing 
inspection proposal which affects processed meat and poultry 
products the plan als is known as discretionary inspection 
a 1986 law authorized overhauling the inspection system and 
putting in place a riskbased program in which processors with 
good records would require periodic inspection rather than the 
daily supervision previously required 
the most troublesome plants would come under tougher review 
one effect would be to cut in half over time the number of 
federal inspectors 
another proposal called the streamlined inspection system for 
the slaughter of cattle is still under consideration a number of 
consumer groups have rallied against it alleging that it would 
increase the chance of tainted beef reaching consumers 
the streamlined cattle inspection program would let federal 
inspectors in slaughtering operations concentrate on looking for 
abnormalities such as tumors and abscesses while allowing company 
employees to check some of the routine tasks to ensure cleanliness 
one of the streamlining effects would be to have carcasses move 
along the inspection line faster meaning less time for checking on 
beef headed for the consumer market 
sen patrick leahy dvt the chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee had urged the department to withdraw both 
the inspection proposals indicating that congress would step in if 
the department didnt reverse itself 
rep ted weiss dny who heads a government operations 
subcommittee in the house said fridays announcement reflected the 
panels hearings last month which documented the failings of the 
discretionary inspection program and showed that it should be 
withdrawn 
but weiss said he was concerned that usda was still proceeding 
with a computerbased system to generate inspectors schedules and 
decide how often each plant will be inspected at the april 11 
hearing he said usda acknowledged that the computer system was 
seriously flawed 
weiss said the decision to retain the flawed computer program 
was dangerous and shortsighted on the part of the department 
rich parker director of information for the industrysupported 
american meat institute said the department acted judiciously 
in fridays announcement to pull back the proposal for inspecting 
processors 
the decision opens the door for developing a consensus plan 
to carry out the 1986 law as congress intended and the trade 
association will cooperate fully with the department and other 
interests to help design an acceptable plan he said

the bush administration says no final 
decisions have been made on which countries should be targeted for 
possible retaliation because of unfair trading practices but other 
sources say japan and the european community are sure to be on the 
list 
rep ron wyden doregon said friday he had learned that the 
economic policy council chaired by treasury secretary nicholas 
brady was recommending to president bush that the administration 
include japan on the list for its barriers to the sale of american 
wood products 
the list is expected to be released perhaps as early as tuesday 
the new york times reported friday that the japanese would 
likely be cited for failing to open their market to the sale of 
us supercomputers the newspaper said that the 12nation european 
community could possibly be included as well for government 
subsidies to airbus the governmentbacked aircraft manufacturer 
the newspaper said that brazil and india were also being 
considered for including on the list of priority nations because 
companies in both countries are allowed to pirate us patents 
copyrights and trademarks 
christina mccowan a spokeswoman for us trade representative 
carla hills refused to comment on the papers list of countries 
other than to say that the final list of countries and products had 
yet to be determined 
at the white house deputy presidential spokesman b jay cooper 
said that the matter was still under interagency review it has 
not gone to the president yet 
under the omnibus trade act of 1988 the administration must 
issue by may 28 a list of countries that maintain persistent trade 
barriers that impede american sales 
those countries would be targeted for intensive negotiations 
over the next 18 months with the threat of retaliation against 
their exports to the united states if no agreement is reached to 
remove the barriers 
while the list must be submitted to congress by ms hills the 
decision on what countries and products to include will be made by 
bush 
the administration has been under heavy congressional pressure 
to name japan to the list because of that countrys huge trade 
surplus with the united states which last year totaled 52 
billion 44 percent of the 1198 billion total us trade deficit 
the compilation of a priority list of countries was mandated by 
the massive rewrite of the countrys trade law which congress 
passed last year the provision known as super 301 for the section 
containing the requirement has turned out to be the most 
controversial provision in the 1000page law 
it has triggered sharp disagreement even within the 
administration with the presidents chief economic adviser michael 
boskin warning that vigorous enforcement of the provision ran the 
risk of counterretaliation by other countries which could plunge 
the world into a global recession 
both south korea and taiwan figured prominently in an initial 
list of 34 countries with barriers against us products which ms 
hills issued three weeks ago it is from that list that the final 
priority list of negotiating targets will be drawn up 
a congressional source who spoke on condition his name not be 
used said there was a good likelihood that south korea and taiwan 
would be kept off the final list because of concessions they have 
already made 
on thursday ms hills announced that south korea had agreed to 
a number of marketopening actions which the united states had been 
seeking 
in addition the trade representatives office announced friday 
that korea had agreed to open its market to imports of many 
agricultural products ranging from poultry parts to bourbon in 
three stages between july 1989 and january 1991 
ms hills called the agreement a positive first step but 
said many us products still would be restricted or banned in 
korea i am prepared to take action on these products if koreas 
liberalization process does not continue she said

the unexpectedly strong income tax payments 
pouring into the federal treasury are prompting analysts to predict 
that the governments budget deficit this year may undershoot 
official projections 
the treasury department reported friday that the government 
posted a record 4145 billion budget surplus in april 
while tax payments always inflate the governments coffers in 
april the bulge was much bigger than expected and three times the 
size of the 1377 billion surplus registered in april 1988 
for the first seven months of fiscal 1989 which began oct 1 
the government ran a 8698 billion deficit 179 percent smaller 
than the 10584 billion shortfall at the comparable point in the 
previous fiscal year 
if the pace were sustained the shortfall for all of fiscal 1989 
would undershoot both the bush administrations projection of a 
1633 billion deficit and the congressional budget offices 
estimate of 159 billion last years deficit was 1551 billion 
its a very encouraging number louis crandall chief 
economist for rh wrightson amp associates in new york said of the 
april surplus what were seeing suggests that the current tax 
structure is generating somewhat higher revenues than we 
thought ahead of time 
crandall who now expects the deficit to be between 135 billion 
and 140 billion said government spending also has been smaller 
than expected so far this year adding to his optimism he said the 
good news could carry over into 1990 and help reduce future 
deficits 
analysts said tax revenues may be running ahead of expectations 
because of increased sales of stocks and other assets that resulted 
in higher capital gains or because taxpayers shoehorned some of 
their income from 1987 into 1988 when the top tax rate was lowered 
the april surplus representing the difference between what the 
government took in and what it spent last month was fattened by a 
6853 billion bonanza in individual income tax receipts up from 
the 5333 billion collected in april 1988 
william v sullivan of dean witter reynolds inc estimated the 
fiscal 1989 deficit will be around 150 billion but he said the 
improvement was the result of a oneshot phenomenon in which 
taxpayers shifted income from 1987 to 1988 
were still experiencing the aftereffects of the tax reform 
act of 1986 sullivan said i would call it a windfall it does 
not portray a substantial pickup in economic growth 
congress this week completed action on a fiscal 1990 budget 
blueprint that would hold the next deficit to 997 billion just 
within grammrudmans 100 million limit for next year 
the governments largest spending categories last month were the 
military social security other programs in the department of 
health and human services and interest payments on the national 
debt 
defense spending in april totaled 2059 billion and reached 
16863 billion for the first seven months of the fiscal year 
virtually even with the level of defense spending at the same point 
a year earlier 
spending on social security last month was 1731 billion and 
totaled 12838 billion so far in fiscal 1989 up 58 percent from 
a year earlier other programs in the department of health and 
human services cost 1434 billion in april and 9712 billion so 
far this fiscal year up 42 percent from the same point in fiscal 
1988 
interest payments on the 277 trillion national debt totaled 
1663 billion in april and 13361 billion so far in the fiscal 
year 112 percent ahead of a year earlier

but gave the excess to charity to stay under the limit 
no limits are imposed on book royalties and senate majority 
leader george j mitchell dmaine earned 22500 in royalties 
from men of zeal a book on the irancontra affair that he 
wrote with his maine colleague republican sen william cohen 
cohens 25763 in royalties also included some still coming in 
from a novel he wrote with exsen gary hart 
the disclosure forms confirmed once again that the senate is 
still populated with millionaires about a third overall 
a notably wealthy newcomer is herbert kohl dwis who reported 
that his milwaukee bucks national basketball association franchise 
lost 95000 last year 
the senators only have to report general ranges of assets and 
income but kohl is among the richest senators he listed assets of 
up to nearly 28 million and liabilities of less than 2 million 
john c danforth rmo whose grandfather founded ralston purina 
listed assets of up to 13 million and no liabilities 
sen edward m kennedy dmass reported he was unable to 
determine his assets which are in a blind trust his income 
however was at least 607686 similarly the extensive wealth of 
jay rockefeller dwva is tied up in trusts 
mitchell is among the paupers of the senate listing assets of 
just 5000 to 15000 under the rules that figure does not 
include his home 
bob dole rkan the republican leader was better off he 
listed assets of about 293000 to 691000 dole listed 36000 in 
honoraria of which he donated 31750 to charity 
dole was among those who reported receiving some interesting 
gifts he accepted a series of lithographs depicting the heritage 
and history of armenian life and a crystal magnolia for his wife 
elizabeth now secretary of labor 
orrin hatch rutah received from former heavyweight boxing 
champ muhammad ali an inscribed championship ring hatch reported 
he considered the ring priceless but the gold content was 
worth 6500 and the gem 1000 
five senators received extensions to file their disclosures 
late they were malcolm wallop rwyo steve symms ridaho 
conrad burns rmont bob graham dfla and john glenn dohio 
the financial disclosure statements sometimes are only as 
accurate as the lawmakers make them 
the justice department on friday accused rep charles rose 
dnc in a civil suit of failing to report on his federal 
financial disclosure statements 138694 in loans he obtained over 
six years 
house financial disclosures for 1988 are scheduled for release

federal regulators are urging a federal 
appeals court to allow the seabrook nh nuclear power plant to 
conduct lowpower atomic tests 
lowpower testing should begin at once to ensure that seabrook 
can begin producing electricity as soon as the nrc has found that 
it is safe to do so nrc and justice department attorneys said in 
a brief filed with the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia 
the 20page brief was filed late friday in response to plant 
opponents request for an emergency court order blocking lowpower 
operations 
on thursday the nrc gave final approval for the lowpower 
license but said it would wait seven days before issuing the 
permit to give the court time to consider the opponents appeal 
nrc general counsel william c parler and other government 
attorneys dismissed arguments by massachusetts attorney general 
james m shannon and other seabrook foes as farfetched and 
simplistic 
shannon joined by antinuclear groups and the town of hampton 
nh contends that the 1150megawatt plant 40 miles north of 
boston will never operate commercially because it will never win 
approval of evacuation planning therefore the critics argue 
lowpower testing would only make the reactor more expensive to 
dismantle down the road and pose a health risk to nearby residents 
but the government lawyers said it is wrong to assume the plant 
will not win a commercial license 
there is no reason to believe that massachusetts refusal to 
cooperate with seabrooks emergency planning is an insurmountable 
obstacle to the fullpower licensing of the plant they wrote 
seabrook officials submitted their own evacuation plan for the 
six massachusetts communities near the plant after gov michael s 
dukakis refused to submit state plans dukakis says it is 
impossible to safely evacuate the seacoast towns 
the nrc and justice department lawyers rejected the opponents 
contention that lowpower testing would cost new england ratepayers 
more money they said a delay could result in an economic loss to 
the consumers 
if lowpower testing should disclose problems that require 
substantial time to remedy something not expected but something 
that has happened in the past delay in beginning such testing 
will result in corresponding needless and expensive delays in 
fullpower operation they wrote 
the public interest lies in avoiding such needless delays in 
utilization of poer plants that have been found safe to operate 
there was no indication when the court would rule 
the commission said regulators could issue the license at any 
point after 4 pm thursday in the absence of a court order 
seabrook officials said they will begin preparations for 
lowpower testing immediately after receiving the license and start 
the tests 10 days later

rep charles g rose iii dnc has become 
the first member of congress to be sued by the justice department 
under the financial disclosure provisions of the ethics in 
government act 
a civil lawsuit filed friday in us district court in 
washington accuses rose of failing to report on his federal 
financial disclosure statements 138694 in loans he obtained over 
six years 
the department sought 30000 in civil penalties for the six 
alleged violations of the ethics in government act it also sought 
an injunction to bar future violations of the reporting 
requirements of the law 
the lawsuit charged rose who is chairman of the house 
agriculture tobacco and peanuts subcommittee failed to report the 
loans from his campaign and financial institutions on the annual 
disclosure forms filed from 1980 through 1986 excepting 1983 
roses personal loans were obtained both from financial 
institutions and his campaign fund from which he borrowed 52995 
according to the complaint 
justice department spokeswoman amy brown said rose is the first 
member of congress to be sued under the financial disclosure 
provisions of the ethics in government act 
in a statement rose said the lawsuit was intended to force me 
to file amendments which the house ethics committee has not asked 
me to file and to pay a fine for amendments to disclosure forms i 
have already filed 
rose said house leaders have told him they would support him in 
the lawsuit because the litigation hinders the continued ability 
of the ethics committee to serve as the primary enforcer of the 
reporting requirements for members of the house 
in a feb 9 letter to a justice department official house 
ethics committee chairman julian dixon dcalif and ranking 
minority member john t myers rind said they believed their 
committee already had taken appropriate action in the case by 
permitting rose to amend his disclosure form to reflect the loans 
the financial disclosure forms are filed each year by members of 
congress by may 15 to cover the preceding calendar year 
the law requires members to report liabilities exceeding 10000 
on the disclosure forms and provides for civil penalties up to 
5000 for each violation 
the complaint charged that rose filed incomplete financial 
disclosure forms by failing to mention both new loans and those 
outstanding from previous years that totaled more than 10000 
in march 1988 the house ethics committee rebuked rose after 
concluding he improperly borrowed funds from his campaign and 
failed to report the loans on his financial disclosure reports the 
committee said it found clear and convincing evidence of house 
rules violations and said roses behavior was deserving of 
reproach

threeday summit of francophone countries wednesday in dakar

bakel on april 9 boiled into widespread violence with senegalese 
attacking mauritanians in senegal and mauritanians attacking 
senegalese living in mauritania 
two senegalese died in the april 9 incident the senegalese said 
the two died from the bullets of mauritanian border guards the

while her husband was flying navy 
planes during world war ii bonnie sparks bought a handicraft kit 
for a leather purse to help pass lonely hours in their new york 
city apartment 
when milt sparks came home he was intrigued by his wifes 
hobby which he developed a quartercentury later into the business 
of making highquality holsters sought by gun enthusiasts and 
police around the world 
wiley clapp feature editor of guns and ammo magazine and owner 
of several milt sparks holsters calls them the very very 
best the first choice of many knowledgeable pistol owners 
im sure in the days of stradivarius there were other violin 
makers clapp said but the virtuoso used a stradivarius 
the dirtroad outskirts of this former gold boom town provide a 
natural location for sparks shop the towns wooden sidewalks 
would make an old west gunslinger feel at home 
but sparks said the wyatt earps of yesteryear wouldnt stand a 
chance in a modernday showdown 
i think that any modern pistolero could clean out the ok 
corral before they could get their guns out of their holsters he 
said 
all holsters are not created equal it seems 
a holster can quite simply be a matter of living or dying 
said mike waidelich a bakersfield calif detective when you 
use it 40 hours a week it needs to be very serviceable it needs 
to be right 
three years ago waidelich convinced bakersfields 235member 
police force to make the sparks standard equipment although it cost 
about 50 percent more than the holsters they were using 
before strapping on a sparks waidelich once had his pistol fall 
out of his holster while chasing a suspect another time he spent 
15 minutes coaxing his weapon out of a poorly designed holster he 
said 
a sparks holster is crafted to hold the weapon snugly as an 
officer runs or climbs over a fence but relinquish it when its 
needed waidelich said 
tony kanaley sparks shop manager estimates that 60 percent of 
the companys business is from police officers clients also 
include such celebrities as hank williams jr and kareem 
abduljabbar 
sparks starts with a stiff piece of vegetabletanned cowhide 
kanaley grades and cuts all the leather and an individual worker 
is responsible for finishing the job 
sparks said his motto is do it right 
dont sacrifice your integrity to make money he said if 
its not right if it doesnt save a mans life in a pinch then 
dont do it 
in the beginning satisfaction in a job well done was sparks 
sole reward now i want to make a little money the 
72yearold sparks said 
recently he has been able to leave many daytoday duties to 
kanaley and his threeperson crew freeing him to travel 
participate in shooting competitions and promote his products 
sparks a former charter pilot and flight instructor worked 
briefly during the late 1940s for a boise belt and holster maker 
but did not become serious about his craft until 1971 when a fellow 
pilot asked him to make a holster 
impressed with the results the friend convinced him there was a 
market for wellmade holsters 
the following year sparks quit his job as a pilot for the us 
bureau of reclamation and in 1973 moved to idaho city

oil industry officials who testified 
during federal hearings into the exxon valdez disaster lied under 
oath to protect their companies financial interests a state 
official charges 
the latest skirmish in the battle of blame over the nations 
largest oil spill came friday after the fourth day of factfinding 
hearings by a national transportation safety board panel the 
hearings conclude today 
alaskas representative at the hearings bob leresche accused 
representatives of exxon shipping co and alyeska pipeline service 
co of conducting a disinformation campaign to help limit their 
liability for the spills damage 
its beyond me how officers of a big corporation like this can 
just tell things that they flat know are lies but theyre doing it 
repeatedly leresche said in an interview 
leresche said he was especially irked by exxons suggestion that 
the march 24 spill was too large to remove and that government 
officials took their time approving use of chemical dispersants 
the latter issue arose in litigation over the larger amoco cadiz 
spill off the french coast in 1978 if exxon and alyeska can prove 
the government stalled efforts to disperse the oil it may be able 
to escape some of its liability costs he said 
the dispersant issue is just a phony red herring that exxon is 
floating and im sure as i stand here that their attorneys have 
figured out that amoco got off on just that issue in the french 
courts he said it has no relation to the facts in this spill 
but its the only legal theory thats ever worked for an oil 
company so theyre telling lies 
william deppe exxons representative at the hearings said he 
and other exxon executives had been told not to comment to 
reporters 
exxon spokesman joe tucker in valdez referred a request for 
comment to the corporations houston offices where calls went 
unanswered late friday 
leresche also criticized fridays testimony by alyeska 
officials who said their contingency plan did not guarantee that a 
major spill could be completely cleaned up for years the industry 
promised it could handle a major spill and prevent an environmental 
disaster he said 
basically what theyre saying is yeah we promised you this 
but now well tell you we had our fingers crossed when we made that 
promise he said 
alyeska a consortium of oil companies that owns the alaska 
pipeline and valdez shipping terminal is responsible for initially 
responding to spills in prince william sound 
company spokesman tom brennan denied leresches charges 
our witnesses told the absolute truth on the stand we stand 
behind their testimony brennan said 
leresche executive director of the alaska power authority was 
named the states oilspill coordinator by gov steve cowper after 
the spill hes a former state commissioner of natural resources 
although the overall atmosphere at the hearings has been polite 
and nonadversarial exchanges between state officials and industry 
executives have been marked by tension and insinuation 
a coast guard officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
friday that state officials were naive or uninformed if they 
believed a spill as large as the one in prince william sound could 
be cleaned up quickly 
in the day after the tanker ran aground no amount of boom could 
have contained a slick that measured 25 square miles and was up to 
a foot thick he said 
but leresche insisted that the industry had changed its tune 
they never said it wasnt reasonable or realistic before he 
said theyd been promising everyone in america that it would 
work now they say all along we knew it wouldnt i dont get 
it 
in fridays testimony alyeska managers testified that they did 
not know whether the temporary unavailability of 25 tons of cleanup 
gear hampered their response to the 109 milliongallon spill

the body of the man authorities say was the 
godfather of a cult linked to 15 slayings near the us border 
has been transported from mexico to his hometown of miami a police 
source said 
the source who works in the mexico city attorney generals 
office said the body of adolfo de jesus constanzo 26 was 
transported friday on a commercial flight to miami 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the body 
had remained unclaimed at the mexico city morgue since constanzo 
died may 6 when he reportedly ordered a partner to shoot him when 
police closed in 
constanzo has been described as the leader of a sect authorities 
blame for 15 killings outside the border city of matamoros sect 
members have said some slayings were ritual killings while others 
were drugrelated 
constanzos body was claimed by a us consulate representative 
acting on behalf of constanzos mother aurora gonzales del valle 
of miami the source said he said funeral arrangements were 
pending in miami but did not have specifics 
the process of transporting the body to the united states was 
complicated by the investigation and red tape associated with 
transporting a body across international borders the source said 
he said even though constanzos family had made inquiries they did 
not claim the body until this week 
us embassy spokesman bill graves said late friday that he knew 
us officials were working to return constanzos body to his 
family but had no further details

metropolitan museum gods were not amused when a 
copy of their zeus statue appeared at another new york museum 
adorned with a baseball bat and a futuristic gstring 
an artistic and legal struggle ensued followed by compromise 
the revised version unveiled at the whitney museum friday was a 
plain zeus displayed with photos of his former self and signs 
explaining the controversy 
it all started in 1930 when the met bought a bronze replica of 
the zeus a famous relic from ancient greece several years ago 
the met loaned the zeus to the queens museum which in turn loaned 
it to the whitney 
enter spanishborn artist francesc torres whose work titled 
oikonomos the greek word for economical was commissioned for 
the whitneys biennial exhibition 
torres envisioned a zeus that symbolized the economic 
spectrum the lowest and the highest from guys who work at the 
corner of broadway and houston cleaning windshields down to wall 
street 
i wanted to use zeus because in greek mythology zeus was the 
chairman of the board torres said 
this statues right hand which traditionally holds a lightning 
bolt or javelin was empty so torres added a baseball bat 
representing a threat to the economy 
torres pointed zeus left hand toward a video projection screen 
which showed a documentary of street people washing car windows for 
change 
perhaps the crux of the matter was a 3inch video monitor it 
was hung from a piece of twine that was wrapped around the statues 
waist and looped around his genitals showing the chairman of 
the board being hindered by his own power said torres 
the monitor showed footage of the stock exchange from the 
mezzanine that was meshed with car racing material to compare a 
car crash and the stock market crash he said 
the exhibit was opened april 27 and was seen by more than 25500 
visitors 
on may 11 the mets department of greek and roman art notified 
the whitney that it would take back its zeus unless the 
accoutrements were removed 
the whitney closed the zeus gallery may 12 took pictures of it 
and opened the revised version friday 
its preposterous but also very fitting because the piece is 
about power torres said thats precisely what has generated 
as a result a power backlash 
dietrich von bothmer chairman of the mets department of greek 
and roman art did not return calls for comment 
but he told the new york times earlier even if the statue is 
a reproduction it is a reproduction of a work of art the image is 
original adding material to it changes the intent and i still feel 
that universally acknowledged masterpieces of ancient art should be 
treated with the respect they deserve 
theyre saying we have betrayed the original intent of the 
artist but who knows what the original intent of the artist was 
torres said there is one small gratification im getting out of 
this i didnt think that in our blase world something like this 
could create such an uproar we havent lost all the ammunition 
after all

maynard jacksons enemies havent forgotten that 
he laid off city workers froze police promotions and snubbed the 
citys business administration during his tenure as the citys 
first black mayor 
still jackson appears poised to sail back into city hall in 
october on a wave of populist nostalgia 
prominent developer john portman and cocacola usa president ira 
herbert are among those who have piled aboard the campaign of 
jacksons sole opponent michael lomax also a black democrat and 
commission chairman of fulton county which includes most of 
atlanta 
but voters apparently remember jackson as the lovable portly 
man who married couples boxed with muhammad ali and stood outside 
city hall collecting naacp donations in a huge cowboy hat 
jackson was leading the polls more than a year ago before he 
entered the campaign that lead ballooned this month 58 percent to 
24 percent for lomax according to a poll by the atlanta 
journalconstitution 
the only think im going to say is im grateful for all the 
support i have jackson said this week 
the numbers are bad news for many business people said 
claibourne darden a longtime pollster and political consultant 
a lot of them dont want him back darden said maynard 
had an antiestablishment antibusiness tone during the last of 
his administration 
jacksons angry confrontations with business leaders were a 
major theme during his two terms from 1973 to 1981 atlanta mayors 
are limited to two consecutive fouryear terms 
his temper wasnt reserved for the private sector he fired 
1000 striking city workers in 1977 rehiring most of them a month 
later and froze police promotions after a mid1970s scandal 
involving cheating on promotions tests 
but among these offended parties only big business has clearly 
adopted lomax as its choice in the oct 3 nonpartisan general 
election local unions and police organizations have yet to endorse 
a candidate 
campaign disclosure reports show lomax has received about 
400000 in campaign contributions from corporate interests over 
the past two years jackson has yet to release his campaign 
contributor list 
in a recent television interview lomax denied that all his 
business support could be attributed to antijackson sentiment 
people are supporting me because they believe i have a good 
record as a competent qualified elected official lomax said 
theres no biased view on development on my part neither for nor 
against it 
business leaders main conflict with jackson came over his 
setaside program which awarded chunks of city contracts to 
minority companies firms owned by blacks and women went from 
getting 03 percent of city work in 1973 to 275 percent in 1981 
what i had was a disagreement on issues primarily affirmative 
action with some people in the business community who said i was 
unyielding on the issue and the reality of it jackson said i 
was unyielding i had to be 
preservation has emerged as a big issue in this years campaign 
because of recent highway construction and other building that has 
changed the appearance of the city 
andrew young mayor since maynard stepped down in 1981 has been 
seen as favoring developers young cannot seek reelection because 
of the twoterm limit 
i think that a lot of developers have seen in mr lomax a 
willingness to sacrifice quality of life for unrestrained growth 
their money follows their comfort level with mr lomax jackson 
said i do not believe in allowing our neighborhoods to be 
destroyed 
tobe johnson a professor at morehouse college said the 
preservation issue is helping jackson 
the neighborhoods view maynard as being protective johnson 
said the rap on michael is that thus far he has not been

alarmed by reports about the vulnerability of 
computer systems to hackers a massachusetts state senator has 
filed a bill that would make it a crime to enter a computer without 
authorization 
sen william keating the bills sponsor hopes to inoculate 
massachusetts hospitals universities and businesses against 
socalled computer viruses with legislation that would create a new 
category of crime analagous to breaking into a building 
its an attempt to put on the statutes a law that would 
penalize people for destruction or deliberate modification or 
interference with computer properties keating said friday it 
clarifies the criminal nature of the wrongdoing and i think in 
that sense serves as a deterrent and makes clear that this kind of 
behavior is criminal activity 
the idea for the bill came from a constituent elissa royal who 
has a background in hospital administration and became concerned 
about the security of patient files 
i heard about computer viruses on the news she said my 
first thought was the clinical pathology program our doctors would 
look at it and make all these decisions without looking at the hard 
copy 
i thought what if some malevolent bright little hacker got 
into the system and changed the information how many people would 
be injured or die 
last november a cornell graduate student robert t morris jr 
clogged thousands of computers around the country by unleashing a 
set of instructions into internet a widely used computer network 
keating and experts in the field believe that many cases of 
computer viruses go unreported often victims file no complaints 
because they do not want to attract publicity or because they 
believe prosecutors do not have the laws they need to press charges 
under keatings bill penalties would increase depending on 
whether the attacker merely entered a computer interfered with its 
operations or destroyed data in the most serious case any person 
found guilty of knowingly releasing a computer virus would be 
subject to a maximum of 10 years in prison or 25000 fine 
the bill is pending in committee as staff members are refining 
its language to carefully define the term virus

former philippines president ferdinand marcos 
was rallying from kidney heart and lung failure but still listed 
in very critical condition a hospital administrator said 
in his current condition there are periods of high and low 
gene tiwanak assistant administrator at st francis medical 
center said friday i guess you can say this is the time hes on 
the upswing so to speak 
tiwanak said marcos fever had subsided and some vital signs had 
improved but the prognosis remained very poor 
marcos was on a kidney dialysis machine and a respirator that 
was helping him breathe tiwanak said he also was being treated 
for pneumonia and bacterial infections 
it is very serious but hes hanging on said imelda marcos 
wife of the 71yearold deposed leader 
he looks good stable said dr edmund ck lum a friend of 
marcos who looks in on the former president every day he will be 
ok 
marcos entered the hospital jan 15 but he suffered kidney 
heart and lung failure on thursday 
mrs marcos made a public appeal friday to philippine president 
corazon aquino to allow marcos to return to his homeland to die 
mrs aquino who came to power when marcos fled here in 1986 
forbid marcos return and said she would not permit him to be 
buried in the philippines out of concern his presence or burial 
would spark unrest 
im confident that sooner or later the filipino people will 
allow him to come home because there is no reason not to mrs 
marcos said 
marcos ruled the philippines for 20 years many of them under 
martial law after his departure there were several foiled coup 
attempts by people linked to marcos 
the fact is the marcoses have caused the philippines a lot of 
pain said tomas buddy gomez the philippine consul in 
hawaii they are a bunch of troublemakers who will utilize this 
event as another opportunity for destabilization 
we have every right to protect the state gomez said we 
have every right to protect the advances we have had in democratic 
stability and economic progress since marcos fled to exile in 
hawaii 
the marcoses are under federal indictment accused of stealing 
more than 100 million from the philippine treasury to buy art and 
real estate in new york in april a judge ruled that marcos was too 
ill to stand trial but mrs marcos was charged she is free on 5 
million bail

the declaration of martial law in metropolitan 
beijing today was accompanied by strict restrictions on reporting 
and photography by the foreign media 
mayor chen xitong said foreign reporters were banned from 
interviewing people on the street at government offices schools 
factories and mines they also are barred from making tapes or 
videos that would incite or instigate chinese to march 
photographers were also banned from taking photos under the new 
measures 
no curfew was imposed however and it appeared reporters would 
be allowed to watch events unimpeded in the streets 
china which generally tries to control foreign reporting at the 
source rather than interfering with the final product had not 
restricted foreign reporting earlier in the student campaign for 
democracy 
a hong kong cameraman reported being taken into police custody 
during protests in april when students tried to storm the 
communist party headquarters several other reporters were pushed 
roughly by police but in general they have been allowed to take 
photographs and conduct interviews at will during student marches 
and confrontations with police lines 
the chinese however cut several us television networks live 
transmissions normal transmissions from the associated press also 
went down for several hours this morning shortly after martial law 
was declared 
the beijing restrictions are not quite as harsh as they are in 
lhasa the tibetan capital and the only other city in china under 
martial law even before martial law was imposed in tibet in march 
most reporters were barred any one who is in lhasa when a protest 
occurs is barred from even watching it 
china has expelled foreign reporters in the past during 
political crackdowns lawrence macdonald an american reporting for 
agence francepresse was expelled in january 1987 after a 
crackdown on previous nationwide student protests he was accused 
of receiving intelligence from a chinese student 
a few months later a japanese reporter shuitsu henmi of kyodo 
news service was expelled on charges of paying a chinese source 
for internal documents regarding the crackdown 
both reporters denied the charges

a year ago today a disturbed woman walked 
into an elementary school and opened fire on helpless students a 
tragedy that still stirs the pupils but has made them stronger in 
some ways an official said 
this has been a year in which we have grown a lot and in which 
weve come a long way winnetka schools superintendent donald 
monroe said friday after an assembly 
hubbard woods elementary school pupils held classroom 
discussions in the morning then sang at the afternoon assembly 
held in the memory of nicholas corwin 8 who was fatally shot by 
laurie dann on may 20 1988 
for some of the children there is still some anxiety monroe 
said but for the most part the children in the school are 
healthy and well and they are stronger in some ways we 
acknowleged the day and acknowledged how well theyre doing and how 
far theyve come in remembering nicholas corwin 
administrators also held a special session for parents and at 
least 60 attended monroe said 
they all have some continuing anxiety about the safety issues 
and the children but they seem to be dealing with them very 
well he said they feel this year has been a positive school 
year and that the children feel comfortable in school and they feel 
confident in school 
a year ago miss dann 30 spent 4 hours delivering poisoned 
juice and arseniclaced snacks to her exhusband a psychiatrist 
and homes where she had worked as a baby sitter 
she tried to light a gas bomb at a school in highland park and 
also set a fire at a winnetka home where she had once worked 
then she carried three guns into the hubbard woods school and 
shot several students including nicholas who died below a 
chalkboard 
she fled to a nearby home and wounded a young man then fatally 
shot herself 
miss dann was being treated for mental illness but her motive 
for the rampage remains unknown 
school officials tightened security after the shooting locking 
all doors except one during school hours and requiring parents and 
other visitors to have identification tags 
the tragedy also sparked debate over gun control in suburbs 
along the lake michigan shore three suburbs in the past three 
months have banned the possession of handguns and a fourth has 
banned the sale and manufacture of handguns

premier li peng a newcomer in the top echelons 
of chinese power has emerged as a hardliner after ordering martial 
law to quash student unrest in beijing 
li his voice fired with anger told the nation that the 
anarchic state created by nearly five weeks of student protests 
is going from bad to worse he promised to take resolute and 
decisive measures to put an end to the turmoil 
hours later the state council headed by li announced that much 
of the capital had been placed under martial law for the first time 
in communist chinas 40year history 
for the student protesters many who have called for lis 
resignation the 60yearold former electrical engineer was finally 
showing his true colors 
li always has described himself as firmly behind chinas 
economic and political reforms and says those who classify him as a 
conservative misunderstand him 
he also has denied that there was a serious rift or power 
struggle between himself and communist party general secretary 
zhao ziyang generally regarded as a strong proponent of rapid 
reform 
but since last fall li and zhao have taken clearly divergent 
paths li appears to have come out on top 
last september with the nations marketoriented reform program 
reeling from 30 percent inflation and chaotic growth li took 
control of the economy from zhao and announced a twoyear austerity 
plan further reforms will be on hold for the duration 
the latest conflict over political reforms has lead to zhaos 
resignation chinese sources say 
zhao reportedly favored giving in to student demands for a 
dialogue to end a wrenching hunger strike by thousands of students 
li apparently backed by senior leader deng xiaoping refused to 
compromise and when the students remained defiant he called in 
the troops 
lis image as a conservative dates back to his six years as an 
engineer student in the soviet union in the 1950s when he was 
imbued with the virtues of central planning he also spent many 
years as an engineer in various energy ministries where the need 
for government controls is more apparent 
li was elevated to full membership in the party central 
committee in 1978 became minister of power industry in 1979 and 
was named vice premier in 1983 he became a member of the partys 
powerwielding politburo standing committee in 1987 and shortly 
thereafter rose to be acting premier when zhao moved over to the 
top party post 
li was named premier 13 months ago 
despite the impression li is a somewhat wooden technocrat 
unlike the suave zhao he has excellent revolutionary credentials 
his father a leading communist fighter was killed by 
nationalist troops when li was three and the young boy was later 
among a group of war orphans brought up by the late premier chou

survivors are planning a commemoration of the 
cursed 1939 voyage that brought 900 jewish refugees to the florida 
coast where they were turned away by the coast guard 
most of the 900 passengers on the steamship st louis eventually 
perished in hitlers death camps their travails aboard the vessel 
became known as the voyage of the damned 
about 20 survivors plan to meet in two weeks for a reenactment 
of the trip on its 50th anniversary this time with a warm 
reception at the miami beach marina 
the group will sail the florida princess to the place where the 
st louis was forced to turn back then return to harbor 
accompanied by a flotilla of private boats and a coast guard cutter 
its a wonderful thing said north miami resident herbert 
karliner who was 12 years old when he and his family were among 
the refugees fleeing germany aboard the ship 
it left hamburg germany for cuba but was denied permission to 
dock in havana when the passengers turned to the united states 
the state department refused to make an exception to a strict quota 
system for immigrants 
on june 4 1939 the coast guard chased the st louis from the 
miami beach coast karliner remembered 
i saw the coast of miami beach very vividly i was so 
impressed with the palm trees he said this week the coast 
guard came by and chased us off such a big country wouldnt let 
900 people in 
on the return voyage the ships captain stopped in belgium 
france holland and england countries that each agreed to accept 
a quarter of the refugees 
those in england were safe but within a year the nazis had 
invaded the other three countries and about 90 percent of the st 
louis passengers on the continent were killed karliner said 
karliners family was sent to france he and his brother went to 
childrens homes and survived 
their mother father and two sisters were arrested by french 
collaborators and sent to auschwitz they were never heard from 
again 
those attending the reunion organized by miami beach jewish 
leaders will include eight residents of south florida the nephew 
of the ships captain gustav shroeder will fly in from hamburg

the chinese government halted live american 
telecasts from beijing as troops closed in on hundreds of thousands 
of protesters in tiananmen square 
in my 20 years of news reporting ive never seen anything like 
this cnn anchorman bernard shaw said friday night 
goodbye from beijing he said signing off 
correspondents were able to continue reporting by phone 
authorities first stopped transmissions from the square where 
videotapes showed soldiers hitting protesters with nightsticks 
then stopped satellite transmissions altogether 
networks were reduced to showing maps and photographs of their 
correspondents who said they hadnt been personally threatened it 
was unclear whether the networks would be able to videotape for 
later airing 
the blackout occurred at the end of a week of coverage of soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachevs visit and the accompanying protests 
chinese officials used gorbachevs departure as justification 
for the move 
mr gorbachev china visit is over a chinese official said 
to cnn translating a written order that had been requested by cnn 
now im here announcing that cnn should stop the movable earth 
station and its transmitting frequencies right away 
an official at the atlantabased cable news network said crew 
members were trying to negotiate with the chinese government for 
permission to resume news coverage 
cnn spokesman steve haworth said he did not think the cnn crew 
was being ordered out of the country 
tapes showed cbs news anchorman dan rather preparing for a live 
telecast from tiananmen square about 830 pm edt only to have 
the picture turn to interference 
viewers saw the unusual sights of cnn and cbs producers haggling 
with chinese officials in hotel hallways and control centers 
he must do what he must do rather told an interpreter as an 
official stood by outside the hotel shangrila but i want him to 
understand that i respectfully protest as strongly as i can 
particularly since he doesnt have anything in writing to break a 
written agreement with 
cbs spokeswoman donna dees said the network had a contract to 
broadcast for another 16 or 17 hours cbs was able to broadcast 
from the hotel shangrila for a couple of hours after the tiananmen 
square blackout 
its good television and its good news dees said we 
were prepared to go to beijing for the summit and though the 
protests were building up nobody expected it to explode like 
this 
bill baxter of nbc news said the network shared a satellite with 
cnn and was unable to get a signal out of china he said efforts to 
book other satellite time were also stymied by the official 
blackout 
abc had arranged for two satellite feeds friday night but got 
neither of them 
in a live transmission from the great wall sheraton hotel in 
beijing cnn showed a government official writing the official 
order on a note pad provided by cnn editors to shut down the 
broadcasts 
the blackout came about an hour after martial law was declared 
in parts of beijing including tiananmen square where hundreds of 
thousands of chinese have been demonstrating for political reforms 
cbs special reports interrupted the season finale of dallas 
the episode was shown delayed but in its entirety 
weve had some calls but we always get calls during 
interrupts dees said

about 1000 ferdinand marcos 
supporters marched today near the presidential palace to demand 
their leaders return and cheered when a speaker predicted a lot 
of dead americans if marcos dies in exile 
marcos 71 was in critical condition today in a honolulu 
hospital after undergoing emergency kidney surgery 
president corazon aquino on friday refused to allow marcos to 
return from his hawaiian exile and said her government will not 
permit the ousted president to be buried in the philippines despite 
a last appeal from his wife 
mrs aquino conferred today with five cabinet members about 
marcos health and afterward officials said the ban on the former 
presidents return dead or alive still stands 
about 1000 marcos loyalists chanting bring back marcos and 
marcos once more marched today from quezon city to within 100 
yards of mrs aquinos office in malacanang palace before 
plainsclothed police turned them back 
they withdrew about 150 yards and began a prayer vigil under 
the watchful eyes of about 30 policemen 
during the rally radio commentator leo obligar warned of a 
revolution if mrs aquino does not relent and allow marcos to die 
in the land he ruled for 20 years 
i also assure you that if marcos dies there will be a lot of 
dead americans obligar said as the crowd cheered wildly we 
want marcos to return here to prevent a revolution 
later obligar told reporters filipinos will kill americans 
because it is the americans who are causing trouble he did not 
elaborate 
marcos supporters blame the united states for kidnapping 
their leader to hawaii during the 1986 popular uprising that 
toppled his government and propelled mrs aquino to power 
on friday marcos wife imelda broadcast an appeal to mrs 
aquino to allow her husband to die in the philippines 
in a statement broadcast by a promarcos radio station mrs 
marcos said she has tried to telephone mrs aquino from hawaii but 
was told the president was busy

a koreanamerican businessman has been 
convicted of conspiring to send nerve gas to iran and may face 
additional charges of espionage a prosecutor said 
a federal jury found juwhan yun innocent of a charge of trying 
to export the deadly gas sarin but guilty of conspiracy to export 
the gas 
no shipment took place but yun 48 discussed with an 
undercover agent the idea of shipping the gas in 500 quarterton 
bombs 
us attorney samuel a alito jr said yun could be charged with 
spying for allegedly having classified documents in his office the 
justice department fbi and military officials were considering the 
possible indictment alito said 
the conspiracy conviction carries up to five years in prison 
but under sentencing guidelines yun faces around three years in 
jail attorneys said 
us district judge h lee sarokin set sentencing for july 13 
the last chapter hasnt been written said yuns attorney 
stephen dratch 
he said he would ask sarokin to set aside the guilty verdict 
because the government was obliged to convince the jury of both 
charges 
dratch had argued during the nearly threeweek trial that yun 
was entrapped by a slick undercover agent from the customs service 
posing as an arms dealer he maintained that the agent used 
economic coercion to entrap yun 
alito said entrapment was the usual argument in such undercover 
stings 
without doing these undercover operations its virtually 
impossible to enforce the arms export laws he said 
yun contacted an undercover agent while seeking to make a legal 
shipment of artillery shells to south korea he discussed buying 
the nerve gas with the agent but called off the deal jan 11 
a day later he was arrested near newark international airport 
at what he thought was to be a meeting with a customs official 
the prosecution succeeded in showing jurors that yun had 
intended to renew the deal when he was arrested

bluecollar workers whitecollar professionals 
and students demonstrating for democratic reform swarmed around 
troop trucks today in an effort to prevent a government crackdown 
from ending their protest 
it was a kind of people power different from what 
revolutionary leader mao tsetung believed could modernize china 
without foreign funds or technology and enable the country to 
survive a nuclear attack 
the people power displayed today was similar to that that pulled 
down ferdinand marcos in the philippines in 1986 but the outcome 
of todays action was far from clear 
li peng step down xiaoping step down many shouted as 
they sped in trucks across the city toward where soldiers of the 
27th and 28th armies were entering from the eastern and western 
suburbs 
the chants referred to premier li peng who signed todays order 
imposing martial law in much of beijing and 84yearold leader 
deng xiaoping who was believed the main force behind the crackdown 
others bicycled or ran to the scene or pleaded with passing 
cars and trucks for a lift 
at a traffic circle in western beijing about five miles from 
tiananmen square about 500 people swarmed around 15 army trucks 
each containing a dozen or more soldiers the soldiers sat 
impassively looking out the back from under canvas covers as the 
protesters earnestly lectured them about the monthold student 
movement for reforms such as a free press and rights guarantees 
maybe you dont understand the real situation a woman told 
the soldiers in one truck you havent been to the square you 
dont know what its like there 
we are people and you are people why do you have no 
feelings several recited in unison your brothers and sisters 
may be university students you should join the people hand in 
hand heart to heart for you too are chinese 
we appeal to people in all walks of life boycott class 
boycott teaching strike from work and strike from commerce one 
youth sitting on the hood of an army truck bellowed through a 
megaphone at soldiers the crowd went wild 
they went even wilder clapping their hands in the air when a 
uniformed policeman joined workers on a truck bed come on out 
he urged the soldiers huddled in their trucks 
army come out the crowd took up the chant no soldiers did 
after hours of haranguing from the protesters the soldiers 
turned around and left in the direction they had come the crowd 
cheered some soldiers smiled waved and flashed vforvictory 
signs 
up and down beijings main avenue changan students medics and 
other supporters stood by the hundreds at intersections to form 
human barricades in many places metal and concrete lane dividers 
were torn from the pavement and thrown across the pavement to block 
vehicles

schoolchildren in soviet georgia have mysteriously 
fallen ill with symptoms similar to those suffered by protesters 
who were gassed in a demonstration last month the official news 
agency gruzinform said today 
the agency confirmed an earlier report from activists that 
children from five or six schools in tbilisi got sick weeks after a 
april 9 clash between demonstrators and troops in the georgian 
capital left 20 protesters dead 
many protesters were hospitalized with nerve damage that doctors 
attributed to the gas used by troops military officials however 
deny using nerve gas 
an editor at gruzinform said the latest victims including small 
children in kindergartens suffered mild versions of the illness 
and none were hospitalized he did not have the number of children 
involved or the dates they became sick 
at least 20 children who became ill shortly after the clash were 
students in a school adjacent to the scene of the demonstration 
soldiers reportedly chased demonstrators into their school and 
sprayed the gas inside the building 
there was no apparent explanation for the new illnesses the 
gruzinform spokesman said a commission of deputies to the new 
soviet parliament was investigating 
georgian schools were closing for the summer today on schedule

the falling price of gold at 
its lowest level on world markets since 1986 has caused two gold 
mines to suspend stock exchange trading and threatens about 15 
marginally profitable mines that may have to close if the price 
drops further precious metals experts say 
south africa is the worlds largest producer of gold supplying 
34 percent of the total export sales of an estimated 600 tons a 
year provide half the countrys annual foreign exchange earnings 
this weeks price plunge to 365 an ounce comes just as the 
annual wage negotiations have begun between the major mining 
companies and the black national union of mineworkers 
a year ago gold was around 450 an ounce analysts attribute the 
fall to a strengthening dollar and an increase in the worlds gold 
supply 
rand mines ltd on friday suspended listings on the 
johannesburg paris and london stock exchanges for two of its 
oldest gold mines 
the company said that at prevailing prices the mines are 
incurring substantial losses and it appealed for more government 
financial assistance to keep them operating 
the two mines are durban roodeport deep which employs 8177 
blacks and 496 whites and east rand proprietary mines where 
10289 blacks and 1155 whites work 
east rand has received government assistance for some time said 
rand mines spokesman greg kukard because production costs exceeded 
revenue last year by about 12 per ton of milled gold 
the national union of mineworkers which represents nearly half 
of the countrys 600000 black miners believes companies should 
use some profits from viable mines to keep marginal mines running 
and support employment 
the union opened annual wage negotiations wednesday demanding a 
uniform minimum wage of 222 a month for underground miners and 
210 for surface workers 
such a policy would mean pay increases of up to 100 percent for 
some workers 
officials at the chamber of mines which represents the major 
mining houses have warned that drastic increases in wages would 
place 15 marginal mines in jeopardy in an industry where an 
estimated 17000 jobs have been lost in the past 17 months 
the star the countrys largest newspaper reported friday that 
the government has been cushioning the immediate effects of the 
lower gold price on the industry by allowing the currency to fall 
to 270 rands per dollar friday afternoon 
the gold price has fallen 9 in the past week and 35 since the 
beginning of the year which could cost south africa almost 700 
million in a year the star estimated

the cook county medical examiner has ruled that a 
15monthold boy unhooked by his father from a respirator died of 
accidental causes 
dr robert j stein made the ruling friday the day after a 
grand jury declined to indict the father rudy linares 23 who 
removed his sons life support and held off hospital staff with a 
gun on april 26 
samuel linares had been comatose since accidentally swallowing a 
balloon last august officials at rushpresbyterianst lukes 
medical center had refused the familys request to withdraw 
lifesupport 
linares on thursday pleaded guilty to unlawful use of a weapon 
a misdemeanor and was released on the condition he undergo 
psychological evaluation and possible counseling 
stein said he reviewed the grand jurys decision before changing 
the death certificate from undetermined to accidental 
when the child was brought originally to macneal hospital in 
august it had aspirated a balloon stein said friday in my 
opinion the child was dead at that particular time 
rushpresbyterianst lukes where the boy was transferred from 
macneal memorial hospital had claimed the boy was not braindead 
but stein disagreed 
the person was dead he said the only thing you kept 
living was the organs i think this is exactly what the jury feels 
and the states attorney feels 
states attorney cecil a partee said his office decided not to 
seek other felony charges against linares after abandoning pursuit 
of the murder count because the young father probably had 
suffered quite enough

the highly publicized trial of 
a white supremacist who killed seven blacks and an asian could 
incite further violence by rightwing extremists a prominent 
newspaper editor said today 
the warning by harvey tyson editor of the star of johannesburg 
followed a week of dramatic testimony in the trial of barend 
strydom a 23yearold former policeman who killed or wounded more 
than 20 blacks during a shooting spree on the sidewalks of downtown 
pretoria in november 
strydom was convicted of eight counts of murder on tuesday over 
the next three days he and his father outlined their racist views 
as part of proceedings to determine whether strydom should be 
sentenced to death 
sentencing is expected next week 
strydom told the pretoria supreme court that his actions were 
justifiable and said he would do the same again if given the 
chance his father also a former policeman said he believed 
blacks were animals not humans 
both father and son belong to the neonazi afrikaner resistance 
movement fellow members of the group have attended the trial to 
show solidarity with the defendant 
tyson whose newspaper is south africas largestselling daily 
said in a column that the extensive local news coverage of the 
trial bodes ill for a country which has bred so many extremists 
we may be witnessing an increase in the growth of the 
ultrarights incoherent killing he wrote it seems more than 
likely that barend strydoms actions could be repeated not just by 
a madman but by sane members of a secret group in our society 
tyson said he had received an anonymous death threat in the mail 
last week 
police have been investigating strydoms claims that he belonged 
to a clandestine rightwing terror group called the wit wolwe 
white wolves but senior officers say they doubt such a group 
exists 
a weekly antiapartheid newspaper vyre weekblad free weekly 
reported friday that stydom had handed a letter to one of its 
reporters claiming that the wit wolwe were responsible for the 
removal of david webster a white antiapartheid activist who 
was assassinated on may 1 
the letter also indicated the group was responsible for a recent 
bombing that damaged the home of a parliament member of the 
governing national party 
in his testimony strydom claimed that wit wolwe leaders had 
instructed him to try to kill anglican archbishop desmond tutu and 
the rev allan boesak two antiapartheid church leaders 
dozens of activists almost all of them black have been slain 
in recent years but in only one case has there been a murder 
conviction police have made no arrests in connection with 
websters killing 
it is vitally important that all political killers are brought 
to book as quickly as possible tyson wrote for if justice is 
not swift and seen to be impartial communal insanity will grow

about 500 burmese government troops 
clashed with thai soldiers today after crossing the border to 
launch an attack on a karen rebel stronghold a thai officer said 
he said a group of 400 soldiers crossed the moei river boundary 
into mae sots ban wangkaew village which has been evacuated due 
to the fighting to set up heavy weapons to shell the camp some of 
them also seized control of a road about five miles from mae sot 
he said 
thai forces fired into the village but the burmese soldiers 
still remained in the evening said the officer speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
a 64yearold thai man was wounded in the clash and thai 
soldiers and paramilitary personnel were sent in as reinforcements 
the officer said thai forces fired artillery rounds as warnings 
to a second group of 100 burmese soldiers who crossed into another 
area of mae sot 
they are attacking across the river and fighting us from the 
thai side said a karen official who asked not to be named he 
said the offensive was the largest since 1977 and that thousands of 
karen civilians had fled to thailand 
the thai officer said other burmese troops perched on two hills 
in burma continued attacking kaw moo ra with heavy shells today 
setting much of the burmese camp ablaze fierce fighting was 
reported in one part of the camp 
he estimated that 1200 guerrillas were defending the camp 
against about 3000 soldiers 
thailand in the past has given sanctuary to the rebels but the 
bangkok government has sent top level delegations to burma to 
discuss the situation last year the military government in burma 
killed hundreds of burmese during widepsread demonstrations for 
democracy 
after putting down the demonstrations the burmese army renewed 
its battle with the karens who began their revolt in 1949 the 
year after burma achieved independence from great britain the 
rebels said at the time that the government reneged on its promise 
of more autonomy for ethnic minorities 
the karen national union has an estimated 4000 combatants and 
is the largest of the 10 ethnic insurgent groups in the national 
democratic front 
kaw moo ra is in karen state and is 140 miles east of rangoon 
the burmese capital government forces began shelling it thursday 
two days after overrunning the major rebel base of wangkha about 
two miles to the south 
wangkha was the fifth karen stronghold to be captured by army 
units since the government launched a bloody dry season offensive 
in october a government spokesman said friday in rangoon that at 
least 43 rebels were killed in the battle for wangkha he said 35 
soldiers were killed and 95 wounded 
the five captured camps are in a 75mile arc hugging the border 
along mae sot district in thailands northern province of tak 
thai officials say the burmese offensive has disrupted the 
crossborder black market trade that provided the karens with funds 
for their insurgency

the founders of hewlettpackard co 
the 10 billion computer and electronics giant returned after 50 
years to the garage where they started out for the dedication of 
the building as a state landmark 
it was in the wooden garage that william r hewlett and david 
packard in 1938 parlayed 538 in capital and an audio oscillator 
into one of the worlds leading electronics companies 
their company which employs 87000 people is has headquarters 
a couple of miles away in palo alto 
but after poking around the dark and dingy interior during the 
dedication friday hewlett and packard said they did not accept its 
billing as birthplace of silicon valley and were not eager to 
reminisce a plaque is to be set in a sandstone rock in front of 
the garage to mark its landmark status 
packard asked how did it felt to return after half a century 
said 
it makes me feel pretty old and decrepit 
i feel the same way said hewlett 
although both are billionaires neither has thought about buying 
the property at 367 addison ave which has become a favorite photo 
stop for touring japanese electronics groups and young stanford 
engineers 
why would we hewlett said its a bunch of junk 
packard said it was the first time theyd been back to the 
garage since 1939 packard and his wife rented the 1905vintage 
woodshingle house in front and hewlett rented a cottage out back 
hewlett who is 76 today and packard 76 have long retired 
from daily management of the company though they remain its 
largest shareholders hewlett resigned as vice chairman of the 
board in 1987 packard remains chairman 
hewlettpackards success spurred the growth of the region 
around stanford university that became known as silicon valley the 
area got its name from the silicon wafers used to make most 
computer chips or semiconductors 
hewlett said he doesnt think the garage should be called the 
birthplace of the valley 
we had practically nothing to do with silicon and we werent 
the first company in the valley he said 
about half a dozen electrical products companies were in the san 
francisco bay area in 1938 hewlett said including a vacuum tube 
factory in nearby redwood city run by charles litton his company 
later became litton industries a huge manufacturer of hightech 
appliances 
a few hundred hewlettpackard employees threw a street party 
outside the garage complete with balloons a brass band and food 
kiosks but neither of the founders seemed excited about the 
landmark designation 
the only trouble is you cant tear it down now hewlett 
said 
im not very strong on reminiscing said packard i think 
we ought to be looking forward instead of backward 
the audio oscillator that the two started out with was a 7950 
model of a 400 machine sold by another company in the 1930s the 
oscillator emits various frequencies allowing the testing of sound 
equipment telephones amplifiers and talking pictures walt disney 
bought eight hewlettpackard oscillators to help make the movie 
fantasia 
packard couldnt remember how much rent he paid for the house 
and garage but guessed it probably was less than 25 a month the 
house in what has become an upscale neighborhood now rents for 
1650

vice president dan quayle has accused soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev of making phony armsreduction 
offers that amount to little more than pr gambits the 
washington post reported today 
the newspaper said quayle told a group of reporters friday that 
i certainly accept and find nothing troubling about white 
house press secretary marlin fitzwaters description of gorbachev 
as a drugstore cowboy 
a drugstore cowboy in a sense connotes a bit of phoniness 
quayle said and there is a bit of phoniness about the 
gorbachev proposals he is perceived as making radical proposals 
out there when they are really marginal particularly the latest 
proposal for a unilateral reduction of warsaw pact conventional 
weapons 
quayle said gorbachevs popularity in the west makes it more 
difficult for us and that having a soviet leader who is very 
pleasing to the west has an easy mannerism to him who is very 
good from a public relations press pr point of view makes it 
harder for the us to gain public approval that is needed to 
maintain some its defense postures 
in another story the post today quoted senate majority leader 
george j mitchell dmaine as accusing president bush of a 
narrow shortsighted and timid response to gorbachevs 
diplomatic initiatives 
what has concerned me is the emergence in recent weeks of a 
negative tone within the administration a tendency to respond 
to gorbachevs initiatives by engaging in namecalling mitchell 
said 
he said it is particularly nonproductive to say what he 
gorbachev is doing is intended to influence public opinion of 
course it is so are actions that we take every day

the government today prohibited 
street demonstrations in panama until at least june 5 
the ministry of government and justice issued a communique 
saying the prohibition was imposed in response to the visit next 
week by delegates from the organization of american states or oas 
the move came after panama accused the us embassy of 
involvement in postelection violence earlier this month that left 
three opposition leaders injured and one of their bodyguards dead 
the foreign ministers of ecuador guatemala and trinidad and 
tobago accompanied by oas secretarygeneral joao baena soares are 
due in panama on tuesday they will try to promote resolution of 
panamas 15monthold crisis 
the oas on wednesday approved a resolution critical of panamas 
de facto leader gen manuel antonio noriega whom it held 
responsible for abuses 
international observers say opposition candidates were winning 
the national election on may 7 when the government annulled the 
results since then there has been no decision on how to select a 
replacement for acting president manuel solis palma whose term 
ends sept 1 
the government said the prohibition of marches rallies and 
demonstrations is in response to the clause in the oas resolution 
calling on the authorities and all political forces in panama to 
abstain from any measure or action that could aggravate the 
crisis 
the government communique said the prohibition will remain in 
effect until the three foreign ministers present their report on 
the panamanian situation at oas headquarters in washington the oas 
gave them until june 5 to do so 
late friday us embassy spokesman terry kneebone responding 
to a government communique said the attempt to link the us 
government to the electionrelated violence was propaganda 
foolishness 
police arrested 17 panamanians who provide security at us 
embassy offices the embassy reported friday fifteen were quickly 
released embassy officials said 
the government said the guards were questioned as part of an 
investigation into violence may 10 three days after the national 
election 
the 17 work for the same private security company that employed 
an opposition politicians bodyguard who was killed and another who 
was wounded when noriega supporters attacked members of the 
opposition with sticks pipes and rubber whips 
the government claimed the bodyguards were trained by the us 
military whose presence was bolstered when president bush recently 
sent in nearly 1900 troops to us bases to protect american 
nationals in the country 
also friday the pronoriega news media attacked the oas saying 
it had prostituted itself in approving a resolution critical of 
panama 
the newspaper critica printed a halfpage cartoon on friday 
showing a naked oscar arias president of costa rica and winner of 
the nobel peace prize licking the feet of a us army general 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez was shown waiting his turn 
to do the same 
the governments of arias and perez promoted the resolution 
adopted wednesday by the oas that criticized noriega who also is 
head of the 15000strong defense forces 
the 17 panamanians who were detained work for tesna protective 
services an american company that operates in panama under the 
name minsa the company provides by contract 87 employees who serve 
as security personnel for us diplomatic offices they are not 
employees of the us embassy 
the bodyguard killed in the may 10 violence was alexis guerra a 
minsa employee who was on leave from the company while he protected 
opposition vice presidential candidate guillermo ford among the 
wounded was another bodyguard humberto montenegro who had been 
employed by minsa until early this year when he resigned to work as 
fords bodyguard the government has said five defense force 
soldiers were injured in the melee 
a communique issued friday night by the attorney generals 
office accused the us embassy of lying to the media about the 
detention of the 17 minsa employees and claimed the embassy 
presented the detentions as harassment 
the statement also said high authorities of the us embassy 
assigned guerra and montenegro to guard ford it claimed the two 
men and other minsa guards were trained in the use of arms and 
explosives by us military units stationed in panama 
kneebone said both allegations were false he said the embassy 
conferred with the 15 who were released

contend the soldiers hamper reunification with communist north 
korea 
the two koreas have been bitter rivals since the peninsula was 
divided at the end of world war ii the two sides fought the korean

president bush said today he was 
ready to go oneonone in a relaxed personal way as he began a 
series of meetings with french president francois mitterrand to 
discuss an upcoming nato summit 
bush and mitterrand met amid reports of a compromise on natos 
shortrange nuclear arsenal 
bush greeted mitterrand at the presidents oceanside compound 
here mitterrand arrived by helicopter and was to spend the day and 
part of sunday with bush 
speaking to reporters moments before mitterrand arrived bush 
said i view this meeting as very important for bilateral 
relations which are very strong im looking forward to 
informal in depth wideranging consultations with president 
mitterrand 
bush said that he hoped the meeting would help to refurbish 
that relationship and strengthen it on a personal basis because i 
do believe that you avoid misunderstandings if you go oneonone in 
a relaxed personal way 
mitterrand landed at the helipad set up at the bush compound on 
a rocky point jutting into the atlantic ocean as the french leader 
stepped from the helicopter bush clapped his hands twice and 
welcomed mitterrand saying bien venue 
bush brushed off questions on the current turmoil in china and 
the proposed compromise on shortrange missiles in europe saying 
ill talk to you tomorrow bush and mitterrand have a joint 
news conference set for sunday in boston after the presidents 
address to commencement ceremonies at boston university 
although us officials disputed reports from west germany that 
a compromise had been nailed down the issue was expected to be 
high on the agenda today in the meeting between the two leaders 
prior to the upcoming nato meeting in brussels 
even as the president was exploring ways to end the disagreement 
among atlantic allies on the future of nuclear weapons in europe 
his administration was reacting cautiously to the current turmoil 
in china 
after a day of silence on the efforts by the beijing government 
to crack down on student demonstrators white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater issued a statement friday night urging restraint 
on both sides 
china declared martial law in parts of the capital saturday and 
declared a news blackout on the demonstrations for political reform 
the announcement of a news blackout is very disturbing and we 
urge that it not signal an end to appropriate restraint or an end 
to dialogue with the students fitzwater said 
on the subject of natos nuclear arsenal a senior white house 
official with the president said friday night the administration 
had received a west german proposal for a compromise and had 
suggested some changes in the wording but had not yet heard back 
from the bonn government 
in bonn a senior west german official said friday that 
washington and west germany have worked out a formula for a 
facesaving compromise in the dispute 
west germany has called for ussoviet talks on eliminating 
americanmade lance shortrange missiles from western europe the 
bush administration has vigorously opposed holding such talks until 
the soviet superiority in conventional weapons is erased 
under the potential compromise the united states would accept 
the idea of negotiations with the kremlin if west germany makes 
clear it does not seek immediate elimination of shortrange nuclear 
weapons 
such an agreement would be largely symbolic since no date has 
been proposed for the start of such talks and they would remain 
conditional on an unspecified improvement in the eastwest balance 
of conventional arms said the west german official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the senior white house official also demanding his name not be 
used said the united states returned a paper to the germans 
with a number of explicit conditions to consider no responses have 
yet been received as far as we know we do not have an agreement 
mitterrand has generally sided with the united states in the 
dispute he said this week in paris however there is no urgent 
need to upgrade natos nuclear arsenal despite us insistence 
that the aging lance missiles be modernized and their range 
extended 
fitzwater said friday that mitterrand shares our general 
concern for the strength of the nato alliance and that the issues 
he raised is subject to discussion 
france is a member of the 16nation north atlantic treaty 
organization but does not share in its military command france 
has its own shortrange nuclear weapons which it has already 
announced it plans to upgrade 
fitzwater said the two leaders will discuss a wide range of 
issues related to usfrench relations certainly theyll talk 
about the nato summit may 2930 
west german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg ended two days 
of talks with secretary of state james a baker iii on friday in 
washington saying the two had made progress towards a common 
stance on natos battlefield nuclear missiles 
he did not elaborate but said the overall discussions were 
very very encouraging 
on friday bush met here with his top armscontrol advisers 
including national security adviser brent scowcroft defense 
secretary dick cheney and adm william crowe chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff 
bush was to take mitterrand to boston sunday where the 
president was to give the commencement address at boston university 
later sunday the president was expected to stop in greenwich 
conn to see his ailing 87yearold mother dorothy walker bush 
recently home from the hospital after suffering an apparent mild 
stroke

with the help of an opposition that 
seems bent on displaying weakness gen manuel antonio noriega is 
buying time to restore his position as de facto ruler of panama 
hes stringing it along and along and along and along said 
one western analyst time is on his side 
noriega whose command of the panamanian defense forces gives 
him real power has outlasted pressure in the past and appeared 
stronger for surviving 
now he is fighting to recover from the may 7 presidential 
election lost by his own candidate and from international outrage 
brought on by attacks on opposition candidates and the annulment of 
the vote 
hardball physical attacks on the opposition candidates 
appeared to backfire and noriega as he has before switched 
tactics he lay low and so did his troops 
the stage was set for the opposition but it proved as it has 
in the past that it is not ready for a starring role 
despite its election claim that it had support from 
threequarters of the nation the opposition was unable to put on a 
credible display of unity 
the attack on presidential candidate guillermo endara and vice 
presidential candidates ricardo arias calderon and guillermo ford 
caused outrage but also fear achieving at least part of its 
intended effect 
there were no demonstrations in advance of last wednesdays stab 
at a general strike even though noriega could not have afforded 
another round of political terror 
the opposition leadership seemed to prefer following on the day 
of the strike it asked people to use their imaginations 
people know that we are not using them as cannon fodder and 
that in itself increases support for our movement said arias 
calderon 
unfortunately that support was invisible on the strike day few 
stayed away from work few factories or businesses closed even in 
opposition strongholds only a few dozen people went into the 
streets 
excuses were rife 
this is not korea this is not the philippines said some 
citing two examples where determined street demonstrations put 
fatal pressure on autocratic regimes 
other excuses included government intimidation an inability to 
communicate because of government media control or the fact that 
panamas ethnic diversity and class divisions militate against 
unity 
but perhaps one of noriegas biggest advantages is the mystique 
he has developed even among opponents some speak of him almost as 
if he were a warlock or a magician a man who can dodge a speeding 
bullet 
he is said to enjoy crises to like the pressure of having his 
back against the wall he is said to prefer death to loss of power 
the opposition and the united states were reduced to almost 
plaintive signals to the defense forces that a coup would be 
welcome 
but they have no contacts in the barracks no way of fomenting 
their own plot 
noriega obviously confident despite condemnation of him by the 
organization of american states began to give interviews and 
appeared thursday at a rally of government supporters 
he accused the us embassy of being involved in the may 10 
violence that left opposition candidates wounded he tried to split 
us policymakers by saying the embassy was misinforming bush 
an oas mission to panama due this week to encourage a transfer 
of power may actually give noriega more time by extending talks 
last year after months of violence that followed his indictment 
on us drug charges noriega also played softball he ended 
harassment of the opposition and of us troops at panama canal 
installations while negotiations dragged on 
he used the time to reorganize the government and purge the 
defense forces then his position consolidated he suddenly ended 
the talks 
nevertheless this year noriega is weaker his election defeat 
was real and showed one and all how small his base of support is 
the nucleus of pronoriega officers that controls the armed 
forces is also small and no scapegoat for the election defeat has 
been found 
noriega can no longer be sure he has the support of the 
rankandfile many of whom apparently voted with the opposition 
and must confront the economic difficulties and political 
complaints of family and friends 
sources in the government report virtual paralysis with layoffs 
planned because revenues are down in large part due to us 
sanctions 
finding civilians to run the government is becoming difficult 
despite a show of normality featuring appearances by acting 
president manuel solis palma 
a member of the panama canal commission and the head of panamas 
railroad have resigned 
noriegas antiyankee jingoism never really caught on despite 
his accusations the drug charges filed against him are part of a 
us plot to renege on turning over the panama canal at the end of 
1999 
the oas resolution condemning noriega and the withdrawal of 
mexican and venezuelan ambassadors were real achievements for 
washington 
and the opposition despite its troubles is unwilling to 
compromise because it knows it cannot agree to let noriega stay in 
any form if it wants to govern 
but noriegas determination apparently remains firm and with 
the initiative back in his hands he seems to find the whole idea of 
stepping down amusing 
when asked at thursdays rally how much longer he could hold on 
he laughed and said thats a good question

democratic party officials around the country 
while loath to prejudge house speaker jim wright are becoming 
increasingly restive as the case drags on and heads toward the more 
intense exposure of a televised ethics committee hearing 
it just does not help the image of the party said north 
carolina democratic chairman lawrence davis when asked about the 
impact in his state of the continuing focus on the speakers 
ethical behavior 
davis also distinguished between the legal and political aspects 
of the controversy saying that if the texas democrat is not found 
guilty of the allegations against him whos to say he should step 
down 
most politicians republicans as well as democrats said there 
was little awareness of the wright case in their home states 
a gallup poll conducted for times mirror co reported that only 
15 percent of people questioned said they were following the ethics 
investigation very closely 
its an inside the washington beltway issue said nathan 
landow maryland democratic party chairman 
i dont hear much talk about it said dwight adams south 
dakota republican party chairman its not anywhere near the 
scale of the tower debate he added referring to the fight over 
president bushs appointment of john tower to be secretary of 
defense the tower nomination was rejected by the senate 
on tuesday the house ethics committee will hear its special 
counsel and lawyers for wright argue the cases for and against the 
allegations concerning the speaker 
wright was not expected to appear at the session at which his 
lawyers will argue for dismissal of the allegations of 69 
violations of house rules 
that session will be televised no decision has been made on 
whether future committee deliberations also will be televised but 
the fact that the case is starting to get more detailed television 
exposure has politicians speculating that public awareness may be 
heightened 
at some point television will at least make people aware that 
jim wright exists and that hes speaker of the house and that 
theres a problem said bonnie campbell iowa democratic party 
chairman 
her republican counterpart in iowa richard schwarm speculated 
that television might accelerate the process a little bit 
frankly the more people learn about it the more it stinks 
television always has some effect said al lapierre 
executive director of the alabama democratic party thats when 
some folks will really start zeroing in on it 
the longer it goes on you dont know what impact its going 
to have said jim ruvolo ohio democratic chairman 
republicans are split over whether the wright case could evolve 
into a national issue that could hurt all democrats 
rep newt gingrich of georgia the newly elected republican 
whip is the leading advocate of trying to raise an abuse of power 
issue against the democrats who have controlled the house for the 
past 35 years 
those democrats who want to gamble that jim wrights little 
problems will disappear are welcome to do it gingrich said in a 
recent interview but its both historically and morally wrong 
and theyre both going to find politically its a disaster 
but most house republicans are shying away from appearing to 
pursue wright with the zeal shown by gingrich in the past 
its very delicate right now said rep vin weber rminn 
members of the house may be asked to act as jurors the 
country should not see republican members of congress as a hanging 
jury 
ed rollins cochairman of the house gop campaign committee 
acted intrigued by the possibility at a recent luncheon on capitol 
hill 
what if because of the wright case because of coelho the 
public begins to focus on the powers of incumbency he said 
referring to press reports that have forced rep tony coelho 
dcalif chief democratic votecounter to revise his financial 
disclosure statement 
what they forget said ruvolo is national issues rarely 
rarely have that much impact on congressional races what matters 
is local issues 
jim wright does not run in north carolina said davis 
its not reasonable or rational that a democrat running in north 
carolina would be held accountable for or guilty of any of the 
things alleged against wright 
at the same time he went on it just does not help the image 
of the party for an officeholder of that party to have unresolved 
allegations made against them that are prominent in public 
attention for any length of time 
i think it hurts the whole congress said bruce benson 
colorado republican party chairman it doesnt just hurt the 
democrats 
an issue or problem that festers leaves the opportunity for 
infection said landow if its a wound the way to take care 
of it is to close it as soon as possible to prevent the infection 
from spreading

sabine lake ethics investigators are still looking into 
whether wright received improper proceeds from a 1988 investment in 
a texas gas drilling venture known as the sabine lake prospect 
the venture yielded wrights blind trust a quick 170000 profit 
even though the well has so far proven dry doug jaffe a san

23000 in dividends unavailable to other investors and got help 
paying the interest on his loan the ethics panel still is 
examining the transactions 
pacific institute former employees of a seattle wash firm 
that sells motivational programs say wrights wife betty did little 
or no work for the 36000 salary she received from 1985 to 1988

used the congressional record to print a glowing endorsement of a 
videotape his wife had helped produce for the firm the ethics

president bushs call for 12 billion to beef 
up federal law enforcement to fight crime is likely to get quickly 
mired in the perennial budget battle on capitol hill 
bush unveiled his plan to take back the streets from violent 
criminals just five days after his budget director told congress 
the administration opposed spending more money on the drug war this 
year 
democrats were quick last week to point out what they called a 
contradiction in bushs position 
besides new death penalty provisions and stiffer sentences for 
firearms use bushs plan calls for adding 24000 cells to the 
federal prison system hiring 825 agents and staff for us law 
enforcement agencies and hiring 1600 new justice department 
prosecutors 
administration officials said the 12 billion to pay for the 
program next year could come from a discretionary fund set aside in 
the bipartisan budget agreement negotiated with congress 
but democrats in congress who want to first spend money to 
finance programs enacted in last years drug bill are ready to 
battle bush on the issue 
democrats are anxious to demonstrate to the voters that they 
not bush are willing to spend what they say it takes to fight the 
drug war at the same time there is pressure to keep spending 
within agreedupon limits to reduce the federal deficit 
the drug law authorized 26 million in enforcement and 
drugtreatment programs but only 500 million was actually 
appropriated 
an 822 million spending package proposed by house democrats to 
finance many of the enforcement programs in drug law was already a 
point of controversy between congress and the white house when bush 
made his proposal last monday 
the president hasnt said how we are to pay for his new 
anticrime package sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of 
the senate judiciary committee noted in a statement after bush 
spelled out his plan in speech to a law enforcement group on the 
steps of the capitol 
at the same time he is asking for more than 1 billion in new 
programs his budget director is telling congress his adminstration 
opposes the new funds to pay for the 1988 drug bill 
we need to make tough tough choices how to pay for these 
programs biden said 
the object of bidens ire was a may 10 letter that budget 
director richard g darman wrote to rep jamie whitten dmiss 
chairman of the house appropriations committee opposing the 822 
million democrats want to earmark for antidrug efforts this year 
important though the drug problem is darman wrote it is 
also important that we attend to the urgent need for a restoration 
of fiscal discipline 
darman called drug issue an undesirable complication in 
efforts to agree to an urgent supplemental appropriation that is 
pending in the house the emergency appropriation for the drug war 
is scheduled to be debated wednesday by the house 
in his letter the budget director urged congress not to 
appropriate any more money this year until drug czar william 
bennett makes his recommendations for a national drug strategy 
bennett whose office was created in last years drug 
legislation is expected to issue is report in september 
but congressional aides speaking on condition of anonymity say 
the democratic leadership is ready to press the issue before 
bennett completes his report 
half of the 822 million is intended speed up procurement of 
equipment by law enforcement agencies such as surveillance planes 
used to spot drug smugglers 
biden said he may propose an excise tax on cigarettes liquor 
wine and beer to raise money for the drug fight the excisetax 
proposal that proposal that biden and sen warren rudman rnh 
proposed last year to raise 900 million for the drug war was 
defeated in the senate 
debate over bidens excise tax could come when the senate 
considers the 822 million in the urgent supplemental appropriation

around for those earlier episodes 
like his predecessors the soviet leader has thrown fuel on the 
smoldering fire of nato discord unlike his predecessors gorbachev 
has taken concrete steps toward what he tells the europeans is his 
vision of our common home a continent undivided and secure 
the 16nation alliance is moving toward its may 29 meeting in 
brussels feeling the heat of disagreement between west germany on 
the one hand and the united states and britain on the other over 
negotiating with the soviets on reductions or elimination of 
shortrange nuclear weapons 
west german chancellor helmut kohl whose coalition faces a 
tough election next year is pushing hard for nato to negotiate but 
the bush administration is holding back 
the issue may seem minor in the face of such arms control 
accomplishments as the 1987 treaty to eliminate intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles and progress in talks to radically cut the 
superpower strategic and conventional forces 
but there are fundamental disagreements among the western allies 
and the current problem can be blamed in part but only in part 
on skillful exploitation of those differences by the soviets 
gorbachev has played the good guy offering visions of a 
undivided europe free of nuclear threat 
his foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze has played the 
heavy threatening to halt destruction of ss23 missiles and 
thereby violate the intermediaterange nuclear force treaty that 
was the focal point of the ussoviet summits of december 1987 and 
june 1988 
two other major factors are at work in the current nato discord 
one is the style or lack thereof the bush administration 
displays in dealing with the soviets symbolized by white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwaters description of gorbachev as a 
drugstore cowboy 
the other is more substantive the fundamental difference 
between the united states and its european allies over nato nuclear 
doctrine specifically the socalled flexible response that 
envisions the first use of atomic weapons by the west to repel an 
invasion by superior soviet conventional forces 
the united states and western europe have different 
strategies said paul warnke who was arms control negotiator 
under president carter the united states wants to keep the war 
in europe the europeans want the united states and the soviet 
union to blow each other up and keep the nuclear warheads from 
falling on europe 
gorbachev has capitulated in principle to western demands to 
radically reduce conventional armies in europe agreeing to 
eliminate far more warsaw pact weapons and forces than he would 
require of nato and thereby bringing the opposing alliances into 
rough numerical parity 
but many details remain to be negotiated and until then nato 
must rely on flexible response 
that doctrine has made western political elites secure because 
it deters soviet aggression but every time voters in european 
democracies take a close look at it they view the doctrine as 
fundamentally terrifying said richard k betts a nato specialist 
at the brookings institution in washington 
periodically we get hysterical he said we tend to forget 
that we have had these wrangles within the alliance in the past 
what is different this time is gorbachev he is playing some cards 
that we have not faced on the other side of the table before 
while depicting gorbachev as a drugstore cowboy was not the 
way to win friends and influence people in the kremlin it does 
focus attention on the style of the soviet leader 
gorbachev and his aides often make sweeping promises without 
conducting a policy review said dmitri simes an emigre soviet 
analyst who works at the carnegie endowment for peace in washington 
for example simes said the soviets announced a 142 percent 
cut in the defense budget but they do not yet know what the 
defense budget is 
they announced a 500000 cut in the size of the soviet armed 
forces and then sat back and watched the front pages it was only 
under pressure from congress from the administration and from the 
western press that they began to figure out what they wanted to 
cut simes told the congressional commission on security and 
cooperation in europe

police beat 45 students today as citizens 
demanding democratic reform and the resignation of premier li peng 
poured into tiananmen square by the thousands to defy a martial law 
decree 
in the most violent confrontation since prodemocracy 
demonstrations began nearly five weeks ago students said about 150 
armed police attacked students with electric cattle prods on a road 
in western beijing 
zhu bin a student at the beijing no 2 languages institute 
said the students were blocking 20 military troop trucks from 
advancing down the road when police appeared 
they attacked the girls first we tried to protect them and 
they hit us too he said zhu showing bruises on his shoulder 
said 45 were hospitalized 
down with martial law became the new rallying cry as 
students called for the resignation of li supporters of the 
students arrived by bicycle in the back of flatbed trucks and on 
foot 
later today 3000 students on the square who had been on a 
hunger strike some for as long as a week decided to abandon their 
fast to conserve their strength for the struggle ahead student 
leaders said 
army troops moved into the capital late friday and early today 
but were stopped by thousands of citizens who clogged the roads 
climbed over their trucks and pleaded with them not to attack 
we are people and you are people why do you have no 
feelings one demonstrator shouted at the troopers 
military helicopters made repeated low runs over the city a 
rare sight in this city of 10 million residents 
three tanks just south of the square were being blocked by buses 
deliberately placed across the road today by protesters 
as the day drew to a close hundreds of thousands of people 
remained in control of central beijing and few soldiers were seen 
protests also have been reported in at least 20 other cities 
including shanghai chinas largest city with 12 million residents 
in shanghai more than 300000 people rallied on the waterfront 
of the huangpu river and another 200000 gathered in the citys 
peoples square many carried banners demanding lis resignation 
but the police presence was minimal and there were no reports of 
violence 
youve got millions of soldiers weve got 11 billion 
people read one banner 
the bush administration late friday urged china to use restraint 
in dealing with the demonstrators and called a government 
announcment of a news blackout disturbing 
britain today expressed concern at chinas imposition of martial 
law in beijing and urged the chinese government and demostrators to 
exercise restraint and moderation 
the netherlands canceled a may 2430 visit to china by queen 
beatrix critics of the planned visit had warned her safety could 
not be ensured and said the trip would be seen as a token of 
support for chinas rulers 
martial law took effect this morning in eight districts of the 
capital china central television said 
the zone included tiananmen square the symbolic center of 
china where hundreds of thousands of protesters have been encamped 
the past week 
tiananmen is supposed to be under martial law but its under 
student law said a woman enrolled at northern communication 
college 
the regulations included strict limits on the activities of 
foreign reporters and photographers covering the protests and us 
television networks were ordered to halt transmissions from 
beijing normal transmission wires of the associated press were cut 
for several hours this morning 
the crisis over chinas most serious popular unrest in 40 years 
of communist rule also led to the resignation of communist party 
general secretary zhao ziyang a reformer who pushed for compromise 
with the students chinese sources said 
one asian diplomat said it appeared likely that qiao shi a 
member of the powerwielding politburo standing committee with a 
background in public security would be named to succeed zhao 
li announced the crackdown in a meeting at the great hall of the 
people 
it was the first time martial law was declared in beijing since 
communist china was founded in 1949 
beijing becomes the second city under martial law lhasa 
capital of tibet has been under martial law since march after 
antichinese riots 
beijing university students began protesting for democracy on 
april 15 after former communist party chief hu yaobang died hu 
was ousted in 1987 for failing to crack down on earlier student 
dmonstrations 
although students have been the catalyst for the protests they 
have evolved into broadbased demonstrations 
the official xinhua news agency said li signed the martial law 
order to end serious turmoil that destroyed peoples life 
and social order 
beijing mayor chen xitong signed measures forbidding marches 
strikes class boycotts distribution of pamphlets spreading 
rumors attacks on leaders and media outlets and any other 
destructive actions 
in a separate order he said foreign reporters were forbidden to 
incite or instigate chinese to to march and could not conduct 
interviews or make videos on the streets or at government offices 
schools factories and mines 
li also said a very few people concentrate their attack on 
comrade deng xiaoping who has made great contributions to chinas 
opening to the outside world 
deng 84 is widely admired for initiating marketoriented 
reforms but has come under sharp attack by students for holding on 
to power too long and letting political reform lag behind economic 
reforms

a hollywood murder mystery which has been the 
subject of movieland gossip for six years is unraveling at last in 
court and the characters could have stepped out of a writers 
imagination 
in fact a number of wellknown wordsmiths are planning books 
and articles based on the tale of greed and glitter that led 
producer robert evans to invoke the 5th amendment when asked to 
testify about the murder of theatrical producer roy radin 
evans the former head of production at paramount pictures was 
only one of the colorful witnesses who drew authors magazine 
writers and a cadre of celebrity watchers to the courtroom of 
municipal judge patti jo mckay on opening day of a preliminary 
hearing last week 
author and magazine writer dominick dunne was there for vanity 
fair so were writers steve wicks and michael fessier jr who 
plan books on the case a hollywood entertainment company announced 
it had already optioned the story for a tv movieoftheweek 
the hearing now entering its second week will determine 
whether a woman who was a reputed drug dealer and evans associate 
should stand trial along with two former bodyguards of hustler 
magazine publisher larry flynt in the cotton club murder case 
a fourth defendant also a former bodyguard of flynts is fighting 
extradition from maryland 
the first witness who had ties to drugs and flynts security 
network implicated all of the defendants in the killing of radin 
33 a corpulent cocainesniffing impresario police reports 
indicate that other witnesses will implicate evans 
evans now working on a sequel to his movie chinatown was 
called as the first witness last week but refused to testify on 
grounds that he might incriminate himself tanned and tense evans 
sat nervously on the witness stand while his attorney won the 
battle for him not to testify evans refused to say even whether he 
knew radin 
the case might have been invented by a hollywood scenario 
writer it has links to the secret deals of movie power brokers 
the underworld of colombian drug dealers and flynts lurid porno 
publishing empire key figures in the drama are evans actor demond 
wilson the former star of tvs sanford and son and william 
ryder flynts former brotherinlaw 
the slaying of radin became known as the cotton club murder 
because it dates back to 1983 when evans a top hollywood producer 
was negotiating with radin a flamboyant new yorker to raise 
millions for the movie about a harlem nightspot of the 1920s and 
30s 
a woman known as elaine laynie jacobs had introduced the two 
men that same woman said to have ties to the colombian cocaine 
network of carlos lehder is really karen delayne greenberger now 
charged in the radin murder charged along with her are alex lamota 
marti william molony mentzer and robert ulmer lowe the former 
flynt bodyguards lowe is fighting extradition 
when radin disappeared in may 1983 he was en route to dinner 
with mrs greenberger at the fashionable la scala restaurant in 
beverly hills the two had been quarreling over her demand for a 
share of the profits from evans movie but there were other 
problems she had accused radin of stealing 1 million in cash and 
cocaine from her garage 
a month after he was seen stepping into a limousine with mrs 
greenberger radins body was found in a dry riverbed near gorman 
about 65 miles north of los angeles he had been shot repeatedly in 
the head 
his death made headlines but until last year no one was charged 
with the murder then ryder came forward and said he had new 
information authorities wired him with taperecording devices 
and sent him to gather evidence 
since charges were filed last october ryder has been a 
protected witness he is expected to testify this week along with 
radins former secretary jonathan lawson and wilson wilson 
whose career was being managed by radin has said the doomed 
producer feared for his life and wanted wilson to follow him to la 
scala wilson lost the car in traffic when the driver ran a red 
light according to his earlier account 
most of those details were corroborated last week by carl plzak 
the first witness to link the defendants to the crime plzak a 
body builder and sometime flynt bodyguard received immunity from 
prosecution in the radin murder for his testimony he said he heard 
the others make plans to grab a fat pig and take him to the 
desert later he said they told him about the murder 
plzaks motives have been attacked by the battery of defense 
attorneys who were to conclude his crossexamination monday they 
portrayed him as a drug user and dealer with a conviction record 
and suggested he would say anything to avoid serving jail time he 
adamantly declared he was telling the truth

about 500 burmese troops clashed with 
thai soldiers on saturday after crossing the border to attack a 
karen rebel stronghold a thai officer said 
the officer said other burmese troops perched on two hills in 
burma fired heavy shells on the kaw moo ra stronghold setting much 
of it ablaze in the third straight day of heavy fighting 
about 1200 guerrillas were defending the camp against 3000 
soldiers said the officer speaking on condition of anonymity 
the camp is just across the moei river separating burmas karen 
state and the mae sot district of thailands northern province of 
tak 
the officer said 400 soldiers crossed into mae sots ban 
wangkaew village which has been evacuated due to the fighting to 
set up artillery to shell the camp some also seized control of a 
road about five miles from mae sot the officer said 
thai forces fired heavy rounds into the village and the burmese 
soldiers later moved to another area inside thailand said the 
officer 
he said thai forces fired artillery rounds to warn another 100 
burmese soldiers who crossed into another area of mae sot 
no soldiers were reported hurt in the clashes but a 64yearold 
man was wounded by shrapnel from shells that strayed into mae sot 
from burma 
they the burmese soldiers are attacking across the river and 
fighting us from the thai side said a karen official who 
demanded anonymity 
he said the offensive against the rebels was the largest since 
1977 and that thousands of karen civilians had fled to thailand 
thailand in the past has given sanctuary to the rebels who have 
been fighting for four decades for greater autonomy 
but the tradeoriented bangkok government has sent senior 
officials to burma to discuss the situation and has repatriated 
hundreds of burmese students who had been fighting alongside the 
rebels 
these actions broke the international isolation of the military 
government in rangoon which last year killed hundreds of people 
while putting down widespread prodemocracy demonstrations led by 
students 
government forces began shelling the kaw moo ra stronghold 
thursday two days after overrunning the major rebel base of 
wangkha two miles to the south 
wangkha was the fifth karen stronghold along the thai frontier 
to be captured since the government launched an offensive in 
october 
a government spokesman said in rangoon that at least 43 rebels 
and 35 soldiers were killed in the battle for wangkha 
with an estimated 4000 combatants the karen national union is 
the largest of 10 ethnic insurgent groups joined in the national 
democratic front 
the karens began their revolt in 1949 the year after burma 
achieved independence from britain the rebels said at the time 
that the government reneged on its promise of more autonomy for 
ethnic minorities

leona tennyson is known as the betsy ross 
of the prairie for her work in assembling the worlds largest 
quilt now like the original betsy ross she has a fight on her 
hands state officials want to take apart her labor of love 
i will never allow it to be dismantled i will fight to the 
end for that declared tennyson a 74yearold ranch owner and 
insurance saleswoman 
the quilt is shaped like north dakota and features intricate 
details of each of the states 53 counties and 1358 townships it 
weighs 800 pounds and measures 85 by 134 feet 1 times as long and 
wide as a basketball court twentyfive to 40 people are needed to 
carry it 
but tennysons pride and joy now sits in a heap stuffed with 
mothballs and covered with plastic in a storage room at minot 
state universitys athletic complex critics call it a white 
elephant and they say tennyson is too stubborn to admit it 
the state historical board which oversees items placed in the 
state museum in bismarck refused to accept the quilt for display 
saying it was not a historical artifact the board recommended it 
be dismantled so each county could be given its particular section 
a proposal that angered tennyson 
it is too beautiful of a piece of work to be torn apart she 
said the sections fit together just like sections of land on the 
ground 
the state centennial commission which gave tennyson about 
10000 in expense money for the project has appointed a special 
committee to find a solution to the quilt quandary 
state tourism director jim fuglie a member of the panel says 
he poohpoohed the quilt until he walked on it tracing a path 
from his hometown of hettinger to bismarck 
just the incredible calculation to make it fit to scale is 
phenomenal fuglie said my instincts are not to dismantle it 
i think there is a way to display it we just havent found 
it 
tennyson a rustyhaired greatgrandmother lives alone in a 
modest home in this town of 100 people just two miles south of the 
canadian border 
she recently bought a van to haul the quilt to events during the 
states 100th birthday celebration this summer she probably will 
charge 1 to see it she said 
state officials rallied around tennyson when she struggled to 
make her quilt the worlds largest especially when she had to 
enlarge it at the last minute to surpass a quilt in australia 
gov george sinner held a news conference to promote the 
project and the quilt was displayed on the state capitol grounds 
as well as in fargos civic auditorium 
the guinness book of world records certified the quilt last july 
as the worlds largest a quilt that was assembled in san francisco 
to memorialize aids victims was many times larger but its panels 
were laid side by side not actually sewn together 
former gov arthur link chairman of the centennial commission 
said the dispute over the quilt involves some basic questions who 
owns it and what possible use could be found for it 
one solution would be to put it on a huge roller sort of like 
an endless towel link suggested another idea is to store the 
quilt in an airtight container and use pictures to explain it 
tennyson coordinated the citizens centennial quilt committee 
which used 7000 volunteers to cut and assemble the pieces that 
eventually became the quilt volunteers in each township and county 
were responsible for their own sections and the 53 completed 
county sections were sent to tennyson in antler where she and some 
local volunteers sewed together the completed quilt 
some feel she got paid for it so it isnt hers shes very 
set in her ways said bartender madonna eide in antler where 
tennyson and her quilt are a popular conversation piece 
but letters tennyson receives from people across the state one 
woman suggested each resident of the state donate 1 to construct a 
building for the blanket convince her that the quilt should never 
be dismantled 
i dont think you call that being stubborn you are just 
standing up for your rights she said smiling 
north dakotans should be proud they sewed the worlds largest 
quilt the seamstress said 
they officials have to sign papers that that quilt will not 
be taken apart before i turn it over to them she said 
thats my baby

us officials who hatched the 
irancontra arms deal took advantage of the united states good 
relations with honduras the former head of the honduran military 
says 
but retired gen walter lopez reyes said he has no knowledge 
that president bush was involved in any deal through which honduras 
would receive aid in exchange for supporting covert aid to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
lopez was armed forces chief from april 1984 to february 1986 
which covered the period during which us officials reputedly sold 
arms to iran in exchange for aid to the nicaraguan contras 
lopez was critical of the 1985 us program to give nicaraguan 
rebels covert lethal aid and of the man who ran it oliver north 
i always saw how it was going to affect honduras because of 
how it the plan was conceived he said it was done behind 
the back of congress behind the back of the general public lying 
publicly 
congress banned military aid to the contras during part of the 
time lopez was in office 
the aid scheme has raised questions about whether bush vice 
president at the time was involved north an exnational security 
council aide was convicted may 4 of aiding and abetting an 
obstruction of congress altering and destroying classified 
documents and accepting an illegal gratuity 
the controversy over the aid and alleged political arrangements 
has touched not only bush but lopez and roberto suazo cordova 
honduran president from 1982 to 1986 
lopez a 46yearold career officer whose early retirement was 
considered by some hondurans to be a result of us pressure wont 
name names 
he says he is writing a book in which everything will come 
out he said he also fears retribution but wont elaborate 
in a recent interview at his modest appliance store lopez spoke 
with some bitterness about what he called the atrocious policy 
in honduras of the north group 
he declined to be specific about who was in the north group 
but said they came down here like entrepreneurs buying 
favors buying consciences 
lopez in october 1985 seized a planeload of war materiel meant 
for the contras and returned it to miami he apparently was upset 
that mario calero brother of contra directorate member adolfo 
calero showed up in the plane with two television camera crews 
when i was told of this i ordered that they should not leave 
the plane lopez said then i told president suazo that it 
should be returned to miami 
suazo ordered the shipment sent back 
the north group tried to influence us into letting it go 
lopez said but that was covert aid and they wanted us to leave 
it alone 
the new york times last week reported a december 1985 memo from 
north to john m poindexter his thenboss on the national security 
council who was about to visit honduras and meet with lopez 
from previous meetings with lopez it is obvious that the 
hondurans perceive the usg united states government is using 
honduras for its own political ends they have learned that we 
withhold our assistance in order to force concessions from 
them they are now using this same tactic with us as a means of 
insuring that the usg will come through for them 
lopez and his colonels realize that the only leverage they 
have over us is their covert support for the nicaraguan 
resistance the north memo said according to the new york times 
report 
evidence at the north trial showed president reagan approved a 
plan in february 1985 whereby honduras would receive increased aid 
in exchange for its cooperation with the covert contra aid the 
plan was to be conveyed to suazo through an emissary 
bush has denied making the offer when he visited suazos home in 
la paz north of tegucigalpa lopez said he knew of no such deal 
i was at the la paz meeting but there are moments when 
presidents want to meet alone lopez said and later i cant 
say to a president what did you talk about 
suazo did not reply to interview requests from the associated 
press but he denied such a deal in april 
i never negotiated our national sovereignty in that manner 
he said 
after the march 1985 visit by bush suazo traveled to washington 
that may to sign a 110 million credit package for honduras the 
money was meant to help honduras with its balance of payments 
deficit 
suazo said his government received 35 million of that package 
the money stopped flowing after the plane seizure episode by lopez 
suazo said his successor current president jose azcona hoyo 
received the balance 75 million 
azconas government also denies any tradeoff with washington 
over the contra aid honduras has not received any aid beyond 
what is publicly known said presidential spokesman marco tulio 
romero

coast guard personnel ceased physically 
plotting the movement of ships outside valdez narrows including 
the area where the exxon valdez ran aground after staff cuts in 
1977 the coast guard commander in valdez testified saturday 
but cmdr steven mccall told federal investigators the change 
in no way reduced the vigilance of ship traffic monitors in 
valdez 
mccall made his statements on the fifth and final day of a 
national transportation safety board hearing on the march 24 crash 
of the 987foot exxon tanker in prince william sound 
the coast guards ability to monitor traffic in the sound has 
come under scrutiny since the accident in which the ship spilled 
nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil the nations 
worst spill 
ntsb officials who heard earlier last week from representatives 
of exxon some crew members on the tanker state officials and 
others have said that they wont complete their report into the 
cause of the spill for several months 
mccall said a new radar system has functions that make it 
unnecessary to physically plot ship movements 
ship monitors testified last week that they could not see the 
exxon tanker on radar in the minutes before it ran aground and had 
no indication it was in trouble 
mccall said the radar system has a range of up to 20 miles but 
the range varies with the weather 
its well within the realm of possibility that the monitor 
could have lost a reliable fix the night of the accident he said 
mccall also said the exxon valdez did not have the coast guards 
permission to leave normal traffic lanes members of the ships 
crew have said it left the lanes to avoid ice 
in other testimony saturday mccall said there was no reason for 
him to take over response to the exxon oil spill soon after it 
happened because resources to deal with the spill werent on hand 
there was no benefit to be derived from me taking it over 
he said response immediately after the tanker crash was handled by 
alyeska pipeline service co an industry consortium that manages 
the transalaska oil pipeline and valdez marine terminal 
mccall said that the use of oildispersing chemicals was 
discussed soon after the accident occurred early the morning of 
good friday tests of dispersant were conducted late that afternoon 
or early in the evening he said adding that he does not believe 
there was an unreasonable delay in carrying out those tests to 
determine the dispersants likely effectiveness 
it took time for the dispersantspraying equipment to arrive 
at the terminal mccall said and when it did arrive there were 
repairs or addon equipment to deal with 
mccall also told investigators alyeska had in stock less 
dispersant than would have been needed to significantly reduce 
damage caused by the spill of nearly 11 million gallons of north 
slope crude oil 
in the test there appeared to be no positive effect from 
the dispersant he said possibly because of the thickness of oil 
on the water 
it was still pretty thick he said 
the use of dispersants has been a continuing controversy in 
evaluations of response to the spill which has stained more than 
700 miles of southcentral alaska shores and killed hundreds of 
birds and marine mammals 
exxon has said the oil would not have spread to devastating 
proportions if state officials had promptly granted permission for 
the use of dispersant dennis kelso state commissioner of 
environmental conservation has said that the state did not stand 
in the way of chemical usage and that alyeska did not have enough 
dispersant to do the job

first came the good news construction 
worker layne landry had won 213 million in the lottery 
then the bad news for the landrys maybe he didnt 
then the good news again oh yes he did 
now reasonably certain that they are in fact 213 million 
richer landry and his wife bernadette are doing what so many 
rich people dont seem to be able to do they are keeping quiet 
they dont want any publicity said tammy landry laynes 
sister 
the landrys were not immediately certain they won because they 
learned that a los angeles tv station first had put the wrong set 
of numbers on the screen during a broadcast wednesday night 
for about an hour the whole family was in an uproar said 
mrs landrys sister geri velasquez of glendora she said they 
finally called lottery headquarters in sacramento to confirm the 
winning numbers 
by then everybody was screaming she said 
it wasnt long before the riverside couple both 29 got on the 
telephone to ask friends and relatives not to answer questions from 
reporters 
the effort was only partly successful since ms velasquez was 
willing to talk to a reporter about why her sister doesnt want her 
to talk to reporters 
shes really scared ms velasquez said i think anyone 
who got that much money would be 
it was the thirdlargest individual prize ever awarded in the 
california lottery the only higher prizes went to two winners who 
split a 514 million lotto jackpot last june other large jackpots 
were shared by more winners or by groups of people who pooled 
their money to buy tickets 
the prizes are paid in installments over 20 years

commerce secretary robert mosbacher said 
saturday he believes japan should be among countries targeted by 
the bush administration for possible retaliation in response to 
unfair trade practices 
under the super 301 provision of last years trade act the 
administration has until the end of this month to decide on a list 
of countries to target for potential retaliatory action 
mosbacher interviewed on cable news networks evans and 
novak program said when asked whether japan should be on the 
list 
well in my own opinion they should be one of those 
mentioned whether they will be or not is a matter of policy debate 
that is going on right now in the bush headquarters 
the united states currently has a trade deficit of more than 50 
billion with japan 
mosbacher said he did not believe that coming down on bad 
trade practices would result in a trade war and deterioration of 
usjapan relations 
in my view even though they the japanese are good friends 
and strong allies it needs to be brought to their attention 
that they are not being good trading partners the commerce 
secretary said

i have reappraised that position and i am fully prepared to fulfill

buttercups monkey 
flowers shooting stars and glacier lilies are sprouting up through 
the ashes beneath the charred skeletons of once towering pines 
a heavy winter snowpack and a moist spring have park officials 
predicting a very very lush early summer that plus the 
hundreds of thousands of acres that were unaffected by 1988s 
ravaging fires is bringing back tourists 
the springs new growth marks yellowstones rebirth which 
researchers say eventually will roll a lush green carpet over the 
areas consumed by last years firestorms 
the national park service has also decided to combat any fires 
that flareup in yellowstone this summer a moratorium placed last 
year on the agencys let burn policy under which naturally 
sparked fires are not fought unless they threaten structures or 
people will remain in place at leat through the end of 1989 while 
the interior department ponders the wisdom of the policy 
its gradually coming park spokeswoman marsha karle said of 
the greening of yellowstone the grass is coming up it should be 
a beautiful spring and summer this year we will see bright green 
grass with a background of black that will really be a nice 
contrast it will stand out more 
even during the height of the fires that involved almost half of 
yellowstones 22 million acres biologists promised the flames 
would clear the way for growth not seen since the early 1700s when 
extensive forest fires spawned much of the vegetation now seen in 
the park 
and though much of the burned areas appear at first glance to be 
sterile the nutrientrich ashes are simply hiding new growth 
we are right now in the tail end of winter said john 
varley the parks chief researcher if you go to the lowest 
elevation areas the stuff that burned around 6000 feet what is 
coming up is gorgeous in addition to grass all of our old friends 
trees and brush are coming up popping up out of the soot nature 
is on schedule 
in some areas such as the road between old faithful geyser and 
norris junction it is hard to believe regrowth is occurring 
charred trees cover the hillsides right up to the road in places 
the leaping flames created mosaics of life and death in the forests 
in addition to new grasses and wildflowers researchers expect 
the fires to spur a major regrowth in lodgepole pine forests pine 
cones that require extreme heat to pop and release their seeds did 
so during the fires and researchers believe some burned areas 
could see up to 100000 new trees per acre 
the seeds are there but it takes a little longer than one 
year for them to germinate karle said over the next few 
years it will occur 
while officials have predicted schedules for regrowth they are 
not sure what will replace the dead trees or what will happen to 
trees that were only singed and now carry an orange tint 
there are a lot of things where we just dont know what is 
going to happen karle said we can predict to a certain point 
but something like this has not happened in many years it is like 
a big research laboratory 
tourists are also witnessing the harsh side of nature many 
meadows contain predators gorging on the carcasses of bison and 
elk grim reminders of forage shortages created by last summers 
drought and fires unusually large herds and the winters harsh 
cold and deep snow 
while one visitor this weekend called the landscape eerie 
others said they were not disappointed by the parks appearance 
im sorry i didnt come before said lemuel taylor of fort 
worth texas but i think it didnt hurt the parks beauty 
some were prepared for the sights they encountered such as 
corky laflesch of frenchtown mont who said he tries to visit 
yellowstone once a year 
it is kind of what i expected he said trees grow back 
my grandkids will see them

the great pyramid of cheops the most 
famous of ancient egypts royal tombs was declared safe for 
tourists and reopened saturday for the first time in nine months 
a dutch woman and an american student were the first of the 
scores of tourists who waited under the hot egyptian sun to tour 
the pyramid 
since august workers had been sealing cracks reinforcing 
limestone slabs for safety and clearing vermin from the inside of 
the magnificent structure which now boasts television monitors 
the restoration project was the first step in a fiveyear plan 
to transform the pyramid area including the sphinx into an 
openair museum 
gasping after the 155foot climb to the kings chamber sophie 
dlang of rotterdam said she and her husband were spending the last 
day of a vacation in egypt 
i didnt think we had a chance to see inside cheops said 
mrs dlang who waited more than three hours for the reopening 
i think what theyve done is great 
michael saxton of dayton ohio said he waited four hours for 
me the pyramid has special meaning because of the way its built 
its amazing 
the great pyramid is egypts top tourist attraction and tourist 
officials protested when it was closed aug 15 
but the egyptian antiquities organization prevailed with the 
argument that newly discovered cracks in blocks lining interior 
passages and a halfinch layer of salt on inside walls had to be 
fixed without interruption by tourists 
with a base of 131 acres it stood at 4814 feet when it was 
built 4600 years ago today it is 31 feet shorter after losing 
about a dozen layers and its capstone it also has lost almost all 
its outer facing of hard white limestone stripped for use in 
stone bridges irrigation canals houses walls and buildings 
zahi hawass director general of the pyramids area said nothing 
had been done to restore the pyramids interior since it was opened 
in the late 1830s 
hawass said in removing salt from the limestone walls restorers 
found weak and cracking rock throughout the pyramid 
in the grand gallery hawass said 500 limestone blocks were 
restored and 16 granite slabs reinforced with stainless steel bars 
some of these slabs were in critical condition he said 
cheops lidless red granite sarcophagus soiled by the touch of 
generations of tourists was cleaned of soot grease and other 
filth hawass said 
he said insects and rats which had invaded the pyramid were 
exterminated television monitors were installed to ensure that 
visitors behave themselves 
during the renovation rubble was cleared and lighting added to 
a chamber winding 396 feet beneath the pyramid opening it to 
tourists for the first time 
of the seven monuments listed as wonders of the world by greeks 
of the second century bc only cheops and the other two large 
giza pyramids remain intact 
the remaining monuments on the list the statue of zeus in 
olympia artemis temple in ephesus the colossus of rhodes the 
mausoleum of halicarnassus in asia minor and the pharos lighthouse 
in alexandria were destroyed by warfare or earthquakes

a prominent citizen is killed by a shotgun 
blast while opening his front door in a small seacoast town a 
veteran police officer shocks the community by confessing to the 
crime 
last week former officer robert mclaughlin dropped another 
bomb he said his wife pulled the trigger 
the 48yearold mclaughlins testimony was the latest twist in a 
confounding mystery in tiny hampton nh where mclaughlin lived a 
short distance from robert cushing a wellknown real estate agent 
and former teacher 
two weeks ago mclaughlins wife susan 36 was convicted of 
being an accomplice to the murder of cushing 63 who was felled by 
two shotgun blasts the evening of june 1 1988 
mrs mclaughlin is appealing the conviction for which she 
received the mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole 
prosecutors charge that mclaughlin killed cushing with mrs 
mclaughlin serving as an accomplice to settle a grudge that dated 
to 1976 when cushing intervened while mclaughin was making a 
traffic arrest and told authorities that mclaughin had used 
brutality 
last week he made a surprise appearance on the witness stand at 
a hearing tuesday and wednesday on his motion to suppress his 
confession his murder trial is scheduled to start may 31 
it took mclaughlin two days nearly six hours on the witness 
stand and dozens of prodding questions from prosecutors and defense 
attorneys before he said his wife had killed their neighbor 
he said mrs mclaughlin told him about the death a few hours 
after the shooting 
i thought she was kidding the haggardlooking mclaughlin 
testified i was advised by her that if i didnt believe her to 
go out and look and see for myself 
mclaughlin a hampton police officer for 18 years said his wife 
threatened to implicate him in the murder if he turned her in he 
said he hoped that if he turned himself in she eventually would 
come forward 
he also said he told his son robert jr that mrs mclaughin 
killed cushing 
robert jr had been the star prosecution witness at the trial of 
susan mclaughlin his stepmother telling the court that his father 
admitted killing cushing with help from mrs mclaughlin 
prosecutors say mrs mclaughlin helped her husband plot the 
killing and stood guard disguised as a man while he committed the 
crime 
robert mclaughlin jr sat unemotionally through his fathers 
testimony last week seated a row behind robert cushing jr the 
victims son who is a locally prominent antinuclear activist 
mclaughlin told police last august that he had turned himself in 
because he couldnt stand seeing cushings widow sitting on her 
deck a short distance from the mclaughlins apartment 
defense attorneys say the statement should be suppressed because 
of mclaughlins impaired mental and physical condition at the time 
he gave it but the judge ruled friday that the statements will be 
admissable 
mclaughlin dismissed by hampton police last fall has been in 
jail since august 
if mclaughlin is telling the truth about his wifes involvement 
in the killing prosecutors say there would be no point of 
charging her with the murder since shes already serving the 
maximum sentence allowed by law on her conviction as an accomplice

the chinese leadership in choosing to impose 
martial law and crack down on prodemocracy demonstrators is 
making a stupid and potentially tragic mistake that could lead 
to their own downfall winston lord the former us ambassador to 
china predicted on saturday 
lord who left china after president bushs visit there earlier 
this year argued on cnns newsmaker saturday that any violent 
repression ordered by the leadership will shortlived and that the 
reform movement will survive 
they have made a serious mistake in my view lord said of 
the governments imposition of martial law whatever the 
shortterm repression its going to be temporary 
the former ambassador called the reform movement too broad and 
too strong to be halted it will come back there have to be 
changes he predicted 
lord argued that the students demands were moderate and could 
easily have been met 
if the students had said we must have multiparty elections 
next week or that we must overthrow the government or the 
communist party then you could understand why the authorities were 
resisting them but they were asking for a freer expression 
anticorruption and specific goals that could have been met lord 
said 
i think the government is making a stupid and potentially 
tragic mistake lord added 
kenneth lieberthal the head of chinese studies at the 
university of michigan agreed with lord contending a crackdown 
might not be successful because support for the students is just 
extraordinary it extends into high levels of the party the 
government the propaganda apparatus and some of the security 
forces 
while there may be bloodshed in the next few days over the 
longer run the people who have been visibly associated with making 
this decision are not going to have very longterm political 
careers in china said lieberthal who appeared on the same 
program with lord 
lord charged that premier li peng who appears to have won a 
major victory with his hardline approach to the demonstrators has 
incited the demonstrators because of his accusations that the 
movement was a political conspiracy directed only by a handful of 
people 
just watch the tv broadcasts to say that you have to be on 
another planet lord said pointing out that even the old blind 
and young have taken to the streets to oppose the intervention of 
the peoples liberation army against the demonstrators 
lord predicted that hardliners like li peng who appear to have 
forced the resignation of the more liberal communist party general 
secretary zhao ziyang might be gone within a year because they 
will be tainted by the violence of the crackdown 
i dont think you should count on the present constellation 
of leaders remaining in place and i wouldnt count out people 
like zhao ziyang who are temporarily eclipsed lord said 
the former us official said it was possible that zhao has 
stepped from the limelight in order to avoid being tied to the 
hardline approach or could have been forced out lord noted that 
such leaders as deng xiaoping have lost power and then returned at 
a later time adding zhou could come back 
lieberthal even contended that the student movement has provided 
zhou with a potential political base that he could use to 
galvanize the country push reform forward and produce unity 
he is the one figure who could potentially calm the situation 
if he acted boldly and had the proper opportunity to do so the 
china specialist said

the three top opposition leaders 
defied a ban on rallies and marched through the streets on 
saturday their first public appearance since they were badly 
beaten following the may 7 election 
presidential candidate guillermo endaro and vice presidential 
candidates ricardo arias calderon and guillermo ford were assaulted 
by paramilitary forces of gen manuel antonio noriega on may 10 
independent observers say the opposition candidates were leading 
the noriegapicked government candidates in the national election 
when noriegas troops seized election ballots 
the results of the election were annulled by the government 
the government saturday prohibited marches meetings public 
demonstrations or caravans of vehicles by any political 
organization until at least june 5 
the prohibition does not have any meaning to us endara said 
as he wended through an outdoor market in san miguelito on this 
capitals eastern outskirts the stop was one of six made by a 
caravan of about 20 opposition vehicles 
the caravan briefly blocked traffic on some major arteries 
leading into the capital police watched but took no action 
endara said the caravan was designed to thank the people for 
their support may 7 
ford said the action was intended to reconstruct the 
confidence of the people in order to make another push 
the tour had all the trappings of a classic campaign swing with 
much kissing of babies handpumping and shouts of viva nuestro 
presidente or long live our president 
a vendor at the rio abajo market shouted of endara hes the 
true president of panama 
the ministry of government and justice issued a communique 
saying the prohibition on demonstrations was in response to the 
imminent visit by delegates from the organization of american 
states

tobago accompanied by oas secretarygeneral joao baena soares are 
due in panama on tuesday they will try to promote resolution of 
panamas 15monthold government crisis

noriega the commander of the panamanian defense forces and the 
real ruler of panama 
the government said the prohibition of political street activity 
was imposed to comply with the clause in the oas resolution calling 
on the authorities and all political forces in panama to abstain 
from any measure or action that could aggravate the crisis 
the united states has been trying to oust noriega since february 
1988 when he was indicted on drug trafficking charges in florida 
noriega has survived economic sanctions and international pressure 
accusing the united states of seeking to scrap a treaty that will 
give panama full control and supervision of the panama canal by the 
end of the century

a court on saturday convicted seven people 
on public health negligence and fraud charges but acquitted them 
of manslaughter in the sale of counterfeit cooking oil that caused 
nearly 700 deaths 
six others were convicted of lesser health violations and fraud 
charges and 24 of the original 37 defendants were acquitted 
hundreds of people affected by the oil shouted murderers we 
want justice as the verdicts were read 
special riot police were called in to clear the courtroom 
police outside the court fired rubber bullets in the air to 
disperse hundreds of the afflicted and their families who broke 
windows as they tried to get back inside 
police arrested at least one woman and several people fainted 
but no injuries were reported 
thousands of people are still suffering from the oil which 
affected their lungs and nervous systems and the government has 
paid more than 400 million for their health care although 
prosecutors had demanded long prison terms for the principal 
defendants the maximum penalty was 20 years 
the defendants included importers commodities dealers and 
retailers prosecutors say they conspired in the spring of 1981 to 
sell as cheap olive oil rapeseed oil that had been adulterated with 
aniline dye and intended for industrial use only 
vendors later sold the oil in plastic jugs at weekly fairs and 
markets in spain 
the harshest sentences went to oil importer juan manuel 
bengoechea and oil distributors ramon ferrero and jorge pich the 
three were convicted of gross professional negligence 
bengoechea and pich also were convicted of violating the public 
health code and ferrero was found guilty of fraud 
bengoechea was sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined 100000 
pesetas or 854 he was acquitted of 600 counts of manslaughter 
ferrero received a 12year prison sentence he was acquitted of 
numerous manslaughter charges pich was sentenced to 10 years in 
prison 
two other defendants elias ferrero and candido hernandez 
were convicted only of fraud and sentenced to four years and two 
months in prison each they also were acquitted of manslaughter 
charges 
the court also convicted enrique salamo and ramon alabart of 
violating the public health code they each received a prison 
sentence of four years and two months and were fined 854 each the 
court acquitted them of manslaughter 
bengoecheas brother fernando was acquitted of manslaughter 
and health code violation charges 
during the 15month trial the threejudge tribunal heard 
testimony from hundreds of the estimated 23000 people still 
suffering the effects of toxic syndrome as the illness became 
popularly known and from relatives of those who have died from the 
illness since it was detected in the spring of 1981 
the trial began march 30 1987 and the tribunal took another 11 
months to reach the verdict after testimony ended it was the 
longest trial in the history of spain which does not have jury 
trials 
the prosecutor had asked for more than 85088 years in combined 
prison sentences for the eight principal defendants under spains 
constitution time served in prison is limited to 30 years 
the tribunal said the prosecution proved a link between the 
adulterated rapeseed oil and the deadly illness the tribunal said 
the principal defendants were aware the oil was toxic although the 
exact nature of the poison was unknown 
the defense claimed there was no proof the oil caused the deaths 
and illnesses 
it is generally agreed that 8yearold jaime vaquero garcia who 
died may 1 1981 was the first victim of the oil his death at the 
time was attributed to acute pulmonory insufficiency 
the prosecution based its case on 600 deaths although medical 
researchers say the number of dead is closer to 700 
the government has paid 406 million in indemnities and health 
care for those still suffering from the effects of the illness 
which affects the lungs and nervous system 
an ongoing separate judicial investigation into the role of 
government officials in the case has not resulted in any charges

about 3500 chinese students in a raucous 
exercise of the democratic rights sought by their colleagues at 
home marched upon their embassy saturday shouting down with 
martial law and freedom now 
the hastily organized sympathy demonstration drew participants 
from more than a score of american universities some were natives 
of taiwan or hong kong but the vast majority were citizens of 
mainland china 
there are an estimated 40000 students from the peoples 
republic of china in the united states virtually all are in 
postgraduate studies and about half are financially supported by 
their government others have won us scholarships or obtained 
other outside sponsorship 
on a day when many students were beaten by police in beijing 
the us demonstrators were given a full escort and high praise by 
capital law enforcement officers who diverted traffic from an 
eightblock stretch of connecticut avenue as the marchers made 
their way from dupont circle to the chinese embassy 
weve had no problems whatsoever said deputy chief e j 
spurlock of the dc metropolitan police who estimated the 
marchers totaled 3500 these are the nicest people ive ever 
met he said 
the marchers many wearing shorts and tshirts on a bright 
balmy day chanted down with li peng the premier of china and 
down with deng xiaoping the senior communist party leader 
most wore headbands with democracy scrawled in both english and 
chinese lettering 
the marchers paused for about 30 minutes in front of the embassy 
before returning down the avenue for a final rally and dispersal 
embassy officials did not emerge from the building during the 
protest and they declined to take reporters calls about it 
in a fashion reminiscent of scores of civil rights 
demonstrations in washington in earlier years leaders of the 
march armed with bullhorns would shout what do we want 
democracy came the answering cry 
when do we want it 
now 
chen li ming a mathematics student at cornell university and a 
native of xing jiang in northwest china said neither he nor his 
student colleagues in china seek to overthrow the communist party 
or reverse the socialist economy everybody knows that would not 
be realistic said chen whose studies are paid for by his 
government 
but we want a china that makes more sense he said we 
want more freedom more economic improvement we want to learn and 
adopt some of the good things about capitalist systems and get rid 
of the worst things about the socialist system 
chen was among about 30 chinese students who made the trip from 
cornell despite disrupting studies for final exams now occurring 
at most other universities as well other sizable contingents came 
from princeton harvard yale brandeis the university of 
virginia duke new york university johns hopkins the university 
of california pittsburgh and the university of pennsylvania as 
well as several schools in the washington area 
the march was organized in less than two days it followed the 
martiallaw decree of the chinese government declared early 
saturday in beijing 
qiao chun ming a student from shanghai at the university of 
pittsburgh said we want to show our support for other people who 
are fighting for our freedom and to show our own government that 
its position is wrong 
qiao said he was disappointed in the weak tone of the bush 
administrations support for the students but we want to express 
our thanks to the american reporters especially the cable news 
network and cbs and dan rather who have carried our story to the 
world he added

after a delay of more than a month a 
train carrying 1500 tons of emergency food supplies left saturday 
for warravaged southern sudan an official reported 
abdul rahman hilou acting relief commissioner said the train 
left muglad in southwestern sudan on its way to aweil a

disease in villages isolated by sudans 6yearold civil war 
officials say at least 100000 people are threatened with 
starvation 
the train had been scheduled to depart on april 15 but its crews 
refused to travel through embattled area without an armed escort a 
further delay was caused by government objections to providing food 
to areas controlled by rebels of the sudan peoples liberation army 
the 132 million program seeks to stockpile 100000 tons of food 
in southern sudan by the end of this month but less than half of 
that amount has been delivered

and seasonal rains that begin in may and turn roads and airfields 
into quagmires until november

early 1983 demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms from 
the predominantly moslem khartoum government for the three southern

proplo leaders of the palestinian uprising 
issued a rare call saturday for retaliatory slayings of israelis 
two teenagers shot by soldiers died of their wounds and 16 were 
reported injured in clashes 
the deaths increased the number of palestinian fatalities in the 
17monthold uprising to 494 twentytwo israelis have been killed 
also saturday israeli police said they were investigating the 
death of a 32yearold palestinian whose body was found at the 
jewish factory in the west bank where he worked as a night watchman 
the latest deaths came a day after a gun and grenade battle in 
the west bank that claimed the lives of an israeli soldier and 
three palestinians 
it was the first gun battle reported during the uprising between 
israeli soldiers and palestinians who generally have attacked 
troops with stones and firebombs 
a leaflet issued by underground leaders of the uprising who are 
linked to the palestine liberation organization said the enemy 
should pay an expensive price for its crimes 
the unified national leadership of the uprising calls on the 
strike forces to kill a settler or a soldier for every martyr of 
our sons said the leaflet the 40th published in the territories 
since the start of the antiisraeli rebellion 
uprising leaders have made repeated calls for attacks on israeli 
targets but in the past have stopped short of urging retaliatory 
killings most attacks on israelis during the uprising have been by 
stonings or firebombs which have often not been lethal 
the underground leaflet urged arab countries to work on 
liquidating israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs plan for 
elections in the occupied territories when they convene for a 
summit in morocco this week 
it also supported the killing of palestinian collaborators with 
israel 
plo chief yasser arafat warned that the use of arms may increase 
if palestinian deaths continue to climb 
so far our people refrained from using arms in resisting the 
occupation forces but the israelis should understand that our 
patience is limited arafat told reporters saturday in baghdad 
iraq 
the army maintained a curfew on most of the gaza strip most of 
the territorys 700000 residents have been confined indoors for 
nearly a week 
an army spokesman said the curfew would be lifted sunday and 
that 50000 gazans employed in israel would be allowed to return to 
their jobs for the first time since tuesday when they were barred 
from entering israel 
mazni abu hatla 13 of the gaza town of rafah died in a 
hospital saturday arab reports said he was shot in the chest 
friday during a riot according to the reports 
ali abdallah mohammed abdallah 18 of el khader in the west 
bank also died saturday he was shot in the head in a clash may 
10 arab reports said 
in the west bank on saturday a 13yearold boy was wounded in 
the back during a clash between stonethrowing rioters and soldiers 
in the town of anabta arab reports said 
seven palestinians were injured by rubber bullets or beatings in 
the west bank and eight were wounded or injured in the gaza strip 
arab reports said 
the army said it had no reports of casualties 
authorities were conducting an autopsy to determine how naji 
mohammed fakih 32 of the west bank town of qatana died arab 
reports said 
mordechai bareket a police spokesman said relatives found 
fakih dead on his bed saturday when they came to visit him at his 
workplace in a factory in the mishor adumim settlement near 
jerusalem

west german officials voiced optimism 
saturday that a dispute with the united states over shortrange 
nuclear missiles would be settled in a way that maintained nato 
unity 
the officials attending a conference here on uswest german 
relations said the administration had accepted the principle of 
negotiations with the soviet union over the missiles 
meanwhile secretary of state james a baker iii said saturday 
that west germanys proposal for resolving the dispute is too vague 
and must be linked more closely with reductions in the warsaw 
pacts superiority in conventional forces 
baker speaking in kennebunkport maine said washington has 
sent a counterproposal to bonn and is awaiting a response 
west german officials said negotiations would be linked at some 
indefinite point to talks now under way in vienna designed to 
reduce tanks artillery and other nonnuclear forces in the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
they would not be held until the sovietled alliance agreed to 
sizable reductions in its forces the officials said 
the acceptance of negotiations at some point represented a major 
concession by the bush administration the west germans meanwhile 
relented in their demands for speedy negotiations 
baker on saturday did not rule out eventual eastwest 
negotiations on curbing shortrange nuclear weapons as germany has 
urged over opposition from the united states 
its the view of our government that negotiations are a 
mistake unless there are significant conditions with respect 
thereto said baker who commented after president bush and 
visiting french president francois mitterrand held a round of talks 
at bushs seaside vacation home 
baker told reporters that bonns proposal calls for negotiations 
at too early a stage without significant progress in talks to 
reduce warsaw pact troops tanks and other conventional forces 
baker said the us counterproposal envisions postponing until 
1992 a decision on deployment and production of missiles that have 
a greater range and are faster than the usproduced lance 
missiles stationed in west germany 
helmut schaefer the west german deputy foreign minister and 
other officials said the united states still wanted to rule out the 
option of negotiating the elimination of all shortrange nuclear 
missiles in nato and warsaw pact arsenals 
schaefer said west germany wanted to leave open the option of 
getting down to zero we ought to see the circumstances before we 
give up options he said 
the us terms for a compromise are to be taken up in bonn 
sunday by chancellor helmut kohl foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher and stoltenberg 
if the dispute is not settled it could disrupt the nato summit 
meeting to be held may 2930 in brussels belgium 
the us terms included a major american concession for months 
the bush administration had ruled out any negotiations with the 
soviets over the missiles saying they were essential to the 
defense of western europe 
west germany backed by several other nato countries demanded 
negotiations and also opposed making natos missiles more powerful 
as the unied states britain and france wanted 
the potential compromise would permit improving the missiles 
but by the time the work began arsenals might be reduced through 
negotiations or even eliminated if west germany has its way 
there are 88 usbuilt lance launchers with about 700 
singlewarhead muclear missiles based in western europe most of 
them in west germany 
all the major west german political parties are united in the 
demand for negotiations out of concern their country is the 
likeliest battlefield in the event of a nuclear war in europe 
schaefer said britain and france give us advice but dont have 
the weapons on their soil 
shortrange nuclear missiles which can have a range of up to 
300 miles are designed to deter a soviet attack 
but schaefer in a speech to the americangerman conference 
here said we have to reconsider our positions and our strategies 
in nato in response to arms control overtures of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
he criticized the bush administration saying it was sitting 
back and discussing whether gorbachev is going to fail or not 
schaefer said the missiles dispute with the united states had 
produced some irritations but that west germanys support for 
nato had not flagged 
at the same time the deputy foreign minister said it would be 
a mistake to foreclose the elimination of all nato and warsaw pact 
shortrange missiles 
he said dramatic cuts in warsaw pact conventional forces 
could make banning all groundbased shortrange missiles feasible 
schaefer said the bush administrations initial opposition to 
negotiations is not backed if i follow the polls by the 
majority of americans 
he said he was optimistic that the us and west german 
governments would work out a good compromise preserving nato 
unity 
schaefer and other west german officials said later the proposal 
presented to defense minister stoltenberg in washington would delay 
missile negotiations until the warsaw pact agreed to make sharp 
reductions in its nonnuclear forces 
then schaefer said the missile negotiations would begin in a 
synchronized way that at this point did not have a fixed date 
initially the west germans had demanded the ussoviet 
negotiations begin speedily 
the conference here is sponsored by the american council on 
germany a private group based in new york it brought together 
government officials educators business executives and 
journalists from the two countries

the bush administration said 
saturday that west germanys proposal for resolving a nato crisis 
over shortrange nuclear missiles is too vague and must be linked 
more closely with reductions in the warsaw pacts superiority in 
conventional forces 
secretary of state james a baker iii said washington has sent a 
counterproposal to bonn and is awaiting a response 
at a news conference baker did not rule out eventual eastwest 
negotiations on curbing shortrange nuclear weapons as germany has 
urged over opposition from the united states 
its the view of our government that negotiations are a 
mistake unless there are significant conditions with respect 
thereto baker said apparently reversing himself on flatly 
rejecting such talks 
baker commented after president bush and visiting french 
president francois mitterrand held a round of talks here at bushs 
seaside vacation home 
addressing the crackdown in china against students demonstrating 
for democracy baker said i dont think its in the best 
interest of the united states for us to see significant 
instability in china 
while saying the united states supports freedom of speech and 
assembly baker said i dont think we should in any way be seen 
to be inciting to riot 
the top item on the bushmitterrand agenda was the rift in nato 
caused by west germanys call for eastwest missile negotiations 
amid a wave of disarmament feeling in west germany bonn also is 
resisting a plan to triple the range and increase the speed of the 
usmade lance missiles deployed in west germany against the 
sovietled warsaw pact forces 
the disagreement has clouded plans for a 16nation nato summit 
opening in brussels on may 29 bush will leave washington for 
europe on friday stopping in rome for two nights before traveling 
to belgium 
despite the nato flap baker said bush and mitterrand had 
concluded that the west has seldom been in a stronger position 
he said the two leaders conferring in bushs shingle and stone 
house overlooking the atlantic ocean thought the nato summit would 
be a successful and forwardlooking event 
the secretary brushed aside criticism from senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine who accused bush of responding too 
timidly to the disarmament initiatives of soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev 
i suppose we would have to conclude perhaps that the 
honeymoon is over baker said 
baker told reporters it was fair to say that bonns proposal 
calls for negotiations at too early a stage that is without 
significant progress in talks to reduce warsaw pact troops tanks 
and other conventional forces 
we think the conditions must be more significant and we think 
that they must be more clearly expressed and that there must be 
considerably more progress with respect to the completion and 
implementation of a conventional forces agreement the secretary 
said 
he said mitterrand was in complete agreement on the general 
outlines of the us position 
baker said the us counterproposal envisions postponing until 
1992 a decision on deployment and production of missiles that have 
a greater range and are faster than the usproduced lance 
missiles stationed in west germany 
he said the proposal if accepted would continue an agreement 
by the alliance to keep our forces up to date where necessary and 
an affirmation by the alliance of the united states development of 
a followon system to the lance 
sources in germany and the united states had indicated earlier 
that a compromise was near on the missile argument 
they said the bush administration after originally rejecting 
the idea had accepted the idea of eventual negotiations 
however bonn would have to make clear it does not seek 
elimination of the missiles and the talks would be conditional on 
an unspecified improvement in the eastwest balance of conventional 
arms according to sources 
awaiting mitterrands arrival bush said the two had a friendly 
personal relationship and that he was looking forward to 
informal indepth wideranging conversations 
bush clapped his hands twice and exclaimed bienvenue as he 
greeted mitterrand and his wife danielle as they stepped from a 
helicopter on a warm sunny day mrs bush was waiting to greet 
them nearby at the bushs shingle and stone house overlooking the 
atlantic ocean 
france is not a part of natos integrated military command and 
mitterrand has made public comments straddling the gap between 
washington and bonn 
at a news conference thursday mitterrand said the time has 
not come far from it when nato could eliminate all the 
shortrange nuclear missiles in central europe 
at the same time mitterrand said nato would not have to decide 
about modernizing the battlefield missiles until 1992 
for their talks bush and mitterrand were accompanied by foreign 
policy advisers notetakers and interpreters 
at lunch they dined on corn chowder and oriental chicken salad 
the dinner menu called for broiled shrimp steamed maine lobster 
and charcoal broiled swordfish 
later saturday bush went fishing while mitterrand worked on a 
speech then the two leaders took a 45minute walk through the 
woods near bushs compuond 
bush as he had done earlier shrugged off questions about the 
current turmoil in china but appeared eager to talk about the 
results of his fishing trip claiming he had caught two fish 
including what he called une mackerel grande 
mitterrand asked by reporters who surrounded the two presidents 
in the woods what he and bush had been talking about he said in 
french weve been talking about fish and fishing 
to accommodate mitterrand and his wife as overnight guests the 
bushes borrowed a kingsized bed from for a local furniture store 
bush and mitterrand will travel together to boston on sunday 
where they will receive honorary degrees make speeches and hold a 
joint news conference 
bushs address is supposed to be a major speech on nato 
he is expected to say the defense of europe depends on the 
forward deployment of substantial us conventional and nuclear 
forces 
at the same time bush is expected to say he has a vision of a 
less militarized europe and that he looks for a lessened 
preponderance of eastern european forces and greater openness 
while their husbands talked mrs bush and mrs mitterrand 
traveled to portland for a private luncheon boat trip and museum 
tour

christian army commander michel aoun on 
saturday accused syria of sending jets on provocative runs over 
lebanon in a plot to continue occupying the wartorn country 
gen aoun whose 20000 mostly christian soldiers have been 
confronting an alliance of the syrian army and moslem druse 
militiamen made the charge in a letter to arab heads of state 
pleading with them to save lebanon 
aoun claimed syrian air threats and persistent shelling of the 
christian coast threaten to ruin a ceasefire called by the arab 
league may 11 to halt the latest round of fighting in lebanons 
14yearold civil war 
aoun who heads a christian military cabinet in lebanons dual 
government did not say when and where the syrian jets made their 
overflights 
but lebanese media reports said a pair of mig17 syrian jets 
twice flew at low altitude over lebanons central mountains in the 
christian enclave north of beirut on wednesday and thursday 
the last known syrian overflights of lebanon were in the early 
days of israels invasion in 1982 israel claimed it shot down 80 
syrian jet fighters in dogfights over east lebanons 
syriancontrolled bekaa valley 
aoun who spoke at his shellravaged presidential palace in 
suburban baabda east of beirut warned arab heads of state who 
meet tuesday in morocco against letting syria swallow lebanon 
you just cannot possibly keep silent about the continuous 
crime to starve most of the lebanese population and force a certain 
christian community down to its knees aoun said 
syria maintains 40000 soldiers on 70 percent of lebanons 
territory under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
but aoun has charged that the syrians have lost their credibility 
as peacekeepers by siding with the moslems he declared a war of 
liberation to drive them out 
he also clamped a blockade march 6 against illegal harbors run 
by moslem militias south of beirut in a bid to reestablish state

with their babies and thousands of students blocked major 
intersections early sunday in a defiant blockade to protect an 
8dayold student demonstration for democratic reform 
crowds in beijing rolled huge cement pipes six feet in 
diameter in front of roads truck drivers moved their flatbed 
trailers packed with coal into position 
every major street going eastwest and most major streets going 
northsouth were blocked by 6 am 5 pm saturday edt the 
government apparently had given in to the blockade and students 
began moving roadblocks out of the way 
dawn is breaking people shouted as the sky grew lighter 
the people have won again 
men in white headbands that read freedom and democracy 
checked identification cards looking for military or security 
personnel 
its only natural said a middleaged man who lived in the 
neighborhood we are protecting the people 
at liu li qiao in southwest beijing thousands of local 
residents assisted by students confronted a convoy of 20 army 
trucks holding more than 600 soldiers about 30 trucks with coal 
and scrap metal also blocked the way 
the peoples liberation army belongs to the people the 
crowd chanted patriotism is no crime 
young men climbed on the trucks and talked to soldiers some 
soldiers laughed and discussed the student movement sitting back 
with automatic rifles in their laps others refused to talk with 
the students 
students clutching microphones spoke to the crowd and the 
soldiers from atop the cabs of the convoy 
dear soldiers said a letter read by a woman in a hoarse 
voice now is the critical time listen to the people surrounding 
you our movement is a patriotic democratic movement

peoples power is unstoppable said a middleaged man as he 
stood with his child near the troop trucks i just cant believe 
they would kill our own students

the bush administration said 
saturday it was not in the best interest of the united states to 
have significant instability in china and said washington did 
not want to be seen as encouraging student demonstrators to riot 
what may be happening here is that the economic reforms in 
china got out a little bit ahead of the political reforms said 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
meanwhile in washington the state department issued a travel 
alert warning american citizens to avoid travel to china and 
urging those already there to stay off the streets 
we recommend that us citizens defer travel to the peoples 
republic of china for the next 72 hours said spokesman adam 
shub travelers in beijing are being advised not to leave their 
hotels or immediate residential areas 
an administration source who spoke privately said it appeared 
us citizens were not in any danger from the demonstrators noting 
some used a replica of the statue of liberty in their protests 
that speaks for itself the source said but he said the 
department had issued the alert to warn citizens against being 
caught up in the ongoing demonstrations 
baker spoke at a news conference where he reported on talks 
between president bush and visiting french president francois 
mitterrand he said both presidents conferring at bushs vacation 
home hoped for restraint in china 
his comments came as hundreds of thousands of students 
demonstrating for democracy defied a martial law declaration and 
swarmed into the streets in beijing 
the bush administration has refrained from criticizing the 
beijing government for its promised crackdown on the demonstrators 
taking a cautious approach baker said i dont think its in 
the best interest of the united states for us to see significant 
instability in the peoples republic of china just like i dont 
think its in the best interest of the united states for us to see 
significant instability in the soviet union 
asked why the united states was not encouraging the students 
baker said i think we should be expressing our support for 
freedom of speech for democratization and for freedom of assembly 
and thats what were doing he said i do not think that 
we should in any way be seen to be somehow inciting to riot and i 
think that we have to be appropriate in our response 
he said a news blackout declared by the government was 
regrettable we wish that that had not been done we continue to 
urge restraint in the situation overall 
baker said it was too premature to conclude that developments in 
china have strengthened the hand of hardliners led by premier li 
peng 
its a little bit unclear exactly what the situation is as 
between the hardliners on the one hand and those who profess to 
support more openness on the other the secretary said 
i think we simply have to wait and see he added i do 
think its fair to say that the situation is unclear and there is a 
certain degree of flux 
asked how the united states would view a harsh crackdown on the 
students baker said thats a very hypothetical qeustion 
that you can obviously understand why i wouldnt respond to 
president bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater offered words of 
support for the studentled demonstrations saying the united 
states stands for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly 
the demonstrations of the last few days indicate that the 
hunger for change remains strong said fitzwater with bush on a 
trip to his seaside home 
the spokesman said the chief executive had received an update on 
events in china during his morning intelligence briefing 
meanwhile defense secretary dick cheney told reporters in 
cheyenne wyo there is very little the united states can do 
from a military standpoint and very little the united states would 
want to do from a military standpoint regarding the situation in 
china 
in washington a state department monitoring group was keeping 
tabs on developments in china 
the state department also expressed concern about the news 
blackout imposed by chinese authorities 
we are concerned over the interruption of the free flow of 
information from beijing which has occurred over the past day we 
hope the progress the chinese have made in recent years will be 
sustained and further advanced the agency said 
the situation remains uncertain fitzwater said both 
sides have exercised restraint and we urge that restraint to 
continue we remain hopeful that a dialogue between the government 
and the students is possible 
friday evening fitzwater called the blackout very 
disturbing 
we urge that it not signal an end to appropriate restraint or 
an end to dialogue with the students the spokesman said 
with martial law declared in some parts of the capital beijing 
mayor chen xitong said foreign reporters were forbidden to conduct 
interviews or make tapes or videos on the streets or at government 
offices schools factories and mines

the head of a failed credit union has been 
portrayed by authorities as a reverse robin hood who diverted 
millions of dollars of deposits from the poor to fund a lavish 
lifestyle of parties and private jets 
lawrence e king jr a flamboyant republican party activist who 
once ran up a 11 million american express bill was released 
friday on his own recognizance after being charged in a 40count 
federal indictment accusing him of fraud and violating income tax 
law 
kings wife alice who faces 12 federal counts also was 
released on her own recognizance by us magistrate richard kopf 
both were scheduled for tuesday court appearances 
last november the national credit union administration shut 
down kings franklin community federal credit union and filed a 
civil lawsuit saying that as much as 39 million was missing from 
franklin coffers 
the victims were not only neighborhood depositors who used the 
credit union for their small accounts but businesses and even 
convents in north dakota and south dakota who invested 
king 44 owned restaurants and bars in omaha and had a home 
near embassy row in washington dc he chartered jets and 
limousines he wore expensive clothing and jewelry including a 
69000 watch seized when a judge ordered kings property into 
receivership 
king declined to comment on the indictment friday but has 
denied any wrongdoing in the past calls to his residence saturday 
were forwarded to his catering business and an employee there said 
he was out and declined to take a message 
friends and associates describe king as a generous man who 
donated to community projects and aids research 
king who is black and a onetime democrat said he became a 
republican because blacks need to be on both sides of the 
bargaining table 
he sang the national anthem at the 1984 republican national 
convention in dallas and threw extravagant parties including one 
at the southfork ranch where the television show dallas is 
filmed last year king spent 100000 for parties at the gop 
convention in new orleans according to court documents 
government documents allege he used credit union funds to make 
more than 40000 in political contributions to republican 
candidates and causes 
kings affluent lifestyle caused some highranking nebraska 
republicans including gov kay orr to keep their distance 
mrs orr received a 2250 campaign donation from king but 
later balked at his offer to be the host of a fundraiser 
we couldnt figure out where his money was coming from said 
george spence mrs orrs finance director 
in a november letter to king assistant us attorney thomas 
thalken said the grand jury investigation into franklins collapse 
included allegations of false entries mail fraud wire fraud and 
federal tax violations 
thalken said the probe also centered on violations involving the 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico contains 
criminal and civil provisions aimed at racketeering and organized 
crime 
court documents said king sold millions of dollars of purported 
certificates of deposit at abovemarket rates 
he committed a long series of fraudulent dishonest and 
illegal acts by which funds were transferred from the credit 
union to himself other people and entities the government 
alleged 
during a 13month period in 1987 and 1988 he made 32120 in 
republican campaign contributions according to government 
documents 
the biggest single contribution 25350 was to citizens for 
america a lobbying group for president reagans economic and 
defense policies 
documents show king also gave money to americans for bush jack 
kemp for president robert dole for president the republican 
national committee and the national black republican council 
because deposits are insured up to 100000 most neighborhood 
investors have been reimbursed by the government but some groups 
exceeded the 100000 limit 
charities held about 8 million in franklin deposits 
investigators said 
the sisters of the presentation of the blessed virgin mary in 
aberdeen sd had 2 million in the credit union other investors 
included the american baptist church usa and the presbyterian 
church usa 
the indictment opened friday named king in 40 counts on charges 
of conspiracy mail fraud wire fraud bank fraud credit union 
embezzlement making false entries in credit union records and 
filing false tax returns

powder used in the uss iowas gun turrets 
where an explosion killed 47 sailors may have been stored at 
dangerously high temperatures before it was loaded aboard a 
newspaper reported saturday 
cannon charges were stored in uncooled barges on the york river 
last summer while the battleship was undergoing repairs according 
to the virginianpilot and the ledgerstar 
exposure to such heat dangerously accelerates the decomposition 
of chemicals used to keep the charges stable according to a navy 
manual on board the ship the powder is kept in cooled magazines 
the newspaper said unidentified navy sources with knowledge of 
the investigation into the april 19 tragedy confirmed that 
investigators were looking at how the powder was handled at the 
yorktown naval weapons station 
storage was not as i understand it in accordance with all of 
the provisions for appropriate storage an unidentified spokesman 
for the naval sea systems command which oversees navy shipyards 
and weapons depots told the newspaper 
navy spokesmen were not available for comment saturday at the 
pentagon and the naval air forces atlantic fleet headquarters in 
norfolk 
the newspaper quoting unidentified sources discussing 
preliminary investigation results said the 110pound bags of 
powder sat on three barges at piers on the york from midapril to 
midseptember 1988 
there was no monitoring of temperatures aboard the barges but 
station personnel estimated they exceeded air temperatures by 25 
degrees air temperatures were 90 degrees or higher for 43 days 
during the storage period according to the national weather 
service 
the stabilizer used to keep the charges safe begins to decompose 
at temperatures higher than 70 degrees according to the naval sea 
systems command op5 manual the navys bible on the care and 
handling of munitiions decomposition reaches a relatively high 
rate above 100 degrees and is dangerously accelerated at 
temperatures above 110 degrees 
the 16inch guns of the iowaclass battleships use up to six of 
the 110pound silk bags of propellant commonly called powder to 
shoot a shell weighing as much as a small car more than 23 miles 
the propellant was manufactured during world war ii and the 
korean war there are no companies making such charges now the 
navy said 
when the navy began reactivating the battleships in the 1980s 
some powder was disposed of because of deterioration the rest was 
reblended to eliminate any hot spots the newspaper said the 
reblended propellant was closely monitored the navy said 
the service is testing powder that survived the explosion and is 
trying to determine what temperatures it may have been subjected to 
last summer and in what condition it was returned to the ship the 
newspaper quoted an unidentified navy official as saying 
munitions experts said unstable powder will either be quite 
volatile or will fail to ignite sailors aboard the iowa have said 
that minutes before the explosion in turret no 2 a gun in turret 
no 1 failed to fire after repeated attempts 
the navy has said the misfire was unrelated to the explosion 
and that the charges came from different batches of powder and were 
of different types 
the navy was unable to say friday whether both batches had been 
subjected to the same high temperatures on the barges the 
newspaper said

the three top opposition leaders 
defied a ban on rallies and marched through the streets on 
saturday their first public appearance since they were attacked 
and beaten 10 days ago 
presidential candidate guillermo endara and vice presidential 
candidates ricardo arias calderon and guillermo ford were assaulted 
by paramilitary forces supporting gen manuel antonio noriega on 
may 10 
that was the day the government controlled by noriega the 
defense forces chief annulled the may 7 election 
independent observers say the opposition candidates were leading 
the noriegapicked government candidates in the national election 
when noriegas troopers seized election ballots 
the government on saturday prohibited marches meetings 
public demonstrations or caravans of vehicles by any political 
organization until at least june 5 
the prohibition does not have any meaning to us endara said 
as he wended through an outdoor market on this capitals eastern 
outskirts the stop was one of six made by a caravan of about 20 
vehicles 
the motorcade briefly blocked traffic on some major arteries 
leading into the capital police watched but took no action 
at one point the candidates met with rep john murtha dpa 
who headed a delegation named by president bush to observe the may 
7 election the delegation claimed endara won the election 
in a departure statement at the howard air force base murtha 
said he had returned to panama saturday morning to inspect 
conditions at american bases confer with u s embassy officials 
and meet with opposition leaders and archbishop marcos mcgrath the 
roman catholic primate of panama 
murtha a member of the house intelligence committee indirectly 
urged the panamanian defense forces to move against noriega 
president bush is not interested in punishing the pdf 
murtha said he is interested in dealing with the pdf the target 
of our dismay is the leader of the pdf 
murtha refused comment when asked if he had spoken to any 
defense forces officers 
endara said the caravan was designed to thank the people for 
their support may 7 
ford said the action was intended to reconstruct the 
confidence of the people in order to make another push 
the tour had all the trappings of a classic campaign swing with 
much kissing of babies handpumping and shouts of viva nuestro 
presidente or long live our president 
a vendor at the rio abajo market shouted of endara hes the 
true president of panama 
the ministry of government and justice issued a communique 
saying the prohibition on demonstrations was in response to the 
imminent visit by delegates from the organization of american 
states 
the foreign ministers of ecuador guatemala trinidad and 
tobago accompanied by oas secretarygeneral joao baena soares are 
due in panama on tuesday they will try to promote resolution of 
panamas 15monthold government crisis 
the organization on wednesday approved a resolution critical of 
noriega 
the government said the prohibition of political street activity 
was imposed to comply with the clause in the oas resolution calling 
on the authorities and all political forces in panama to abstain 
from any measure or action that could aggravate the crisis 
the united states has been trying to oust noriega since february 
1988 when he was indicted on drug trafficking charges in florida 
noriega has survived economic sanctions and international pressure 
accusing the united states of seeking to scrap a treaty that will 
give panama full control and supervision of the panama canal by the 
end of the century

president mengistu haile mariam 
said saturday that three generals who joined in a coup attempt had 
killed themselves rather than surrender 
it initially was reported the three were among officers killed 
by loyal soldiers during the attempted coup that began tuesday 
mengistu did not name the generals he said had committed 
suicide but spoke of them as agents of our detractors 
mengistu spoke at a rally in downtown addis ababa in his first 
public appearance since announcing on radio and television thursday 
that the coup had been crushed 
he told the rally our detractors and their accomplices never 
spared a moment to sow confusion and uncertainity by alleging that 
we have failed to achieve immediate results in our endeavors 
diplomatic sources said nearly the entire high command 
including six rebellious generals were killed during the attempt 
to overthrow the government 
they said the revolt was led by generals humiliated by recent 
defeats in ertirea and tigre provinces in northern ethiopia where 
different guerrilla forces are fighting for autonomy 
the revolt began a few hours after mengistu left for a visit to 
east germany he hurried back wednesday to face the biggest crisis 
of his 15yearold marxist government 
it was reported tuesday that maj gen merid negussie the chief 
of staff and maj gen amha desta the air force commander were

a rally marking the 20th anniversary of 
the peoples park occupation turned into a violent clash with 
police reminiscent of one of the bloodiest riots of the 1960s 
twelve people were arrested 
fifteen police officers were injured during the riot friday 
night and saturday morning near the university of california at 
berkeley including one who was hit over the head with a bottle 
said police spokesman david anderson none however was 
hospitalized two firefighters also suffered minor injuries 
about 70 berkeley and 30 university police scuffled with 
combatants in a crowd of about 1000 as piles of trash were 
gathered and torched and looters smashed store windows then fled 
with merchandise 
at least 28 businesses were damaged during the violence but no 
dollar estimate was immediately available anderson said no other 
injuries were reported 
two berkeley fire department vehicles were overturned and one 
was set one fire said anderson who estimated the damage at about 
40000 another fire engine was vandalized while responding to a 
fire at an intersection in the middle of the riot 
the scene was an eerie replay of the 1969 clashes whose focus 
was the 23acre universityowned lot that the university had 
targeted for housing activists wanted to turn it into a park and 
the dispute came to embody all that the two sides hated about each 
other during that protestfilled decade 
but this weekends violence seemed oddly out of context 
what started here tonight was something that began as a social 
protest but it quickly degenerated into just plain vandalism 
university of california student david brooks 19 said friday 
night 
the rally started about 10 pm and broke up about an hour 
later but the crowd gathered again and smashed windows and looted 
about a dozen stores in the nearby business district most of the 
action was about a halfblock from the park and some three blocks 
from the uc campus 
i thought that peoples park was all about creating peace but 
these riots have no place in the peace movement said julia 
tolley who stood outside a boutique with her boyfriend rusty 
pacatte owner of the store 
the couple said several thousand dollars in merchandise were 
stolen from the store which carries expensive household 
furnishings and clothing 
the same bank of america branch that became a regular activist 
target in the 1960s was struck again by an arsonist 
he lit a paper bag on fire and stuck his hand through a broken 
window said 17yearold greta salmonson it took a few minutes 
and then the flames started coming up 
some of the crowd tried to put out the fire said 24yearold 
political science major blake marnell the banks carpeting and 
paneling were scorched before berkeley firefighters doused the 
flames 
streets were littered with broken glass capsized newspaper 
racks and burning trash cans a clothing store was trashed and two 
husky students stood guard in front of the store trying to keep 
looters from entering 
seven of those arrested were adults five were booked for 
investigation of possession of stolen property one for 
investigation of assault with a deadly weapon and assault on a 
police officer and another for investigation of inciting a riot 
anderson said 
five juveniles were arrested for investigation of possession of 
stolen property he said 
peoples park has remained virtually untouched an encampment 
for the homeless since activists occupied it a generation ago 
after the university drew plans to erect student housing there 
during the original occupation gardens were planted in rolled 
sod tents went up and longhaired protesters moved in the 
university finally fenced the lot on may 15 1969 
when protesters tried to cut down the fence they were met with 
heavily armed sheriffs deputies who peppered dozens of protesters 
with birdshot one man james rector died a few days later an 
artist was blinded and two news reporters were among those who were 
hurt 
thengov ronald reagan sent 2000 national guard troops to 
occupy the city for 17 days a nightly curfew was imposed and 
meetings of more than three people were banned in the first week 
after the riot 1000 people were arrested 
in 1972 the university agreed to allow limited public access to 
the stillvacant park but it has never formally abandoned plans to 
build student housing and recreational facilities at the site 
prompting some recent protests

european finance ministers on saturday 
hesitantly took their first steps toward forging common monetary 
and economic policies 
the finance chiefs of the 12 nations of the european community 
agreed to spell out the measures necessary for better coordination 
among their governments 
but they failed to embrace new proposals calling for sweeping 
policy changes that would lead to a common currency and central 
bank for the trading bloc 
britain has expressed opposition to the plan saying it would 
force countries to give up some of their sovereignty to new 
institutions 
it is i think very glib to assume that you can just go ahead 
on this coursewithout making major changes on the political 
front nigel lawson britains chancellor of the exchequer told 
reporters 
these he said are not changes which we are in any sense 
ready to make 
spains finance minister carlos solchaga said the ministers 
spoke at length and reached minimum agreement on the monetary 
plan at their meeting in a luxury resort on spains costa brava 
dutch finance minister onno ruding described the discussion as 
constructive he said immediate progress should not be expected 
the finance ministers who arrived friday meet twice a year in 
an informal setting to hash over financial and monetary issues 
about 200 yards from the talks about 100 protesters 
demonstrated against military spending by the european countries 
military spending for social spending they chanted 
leading off the ministers agenda was a report released last 
month that urged the nations to begin the move toward economic and 
monetary union by july 1990 
it is part of the drive to create a common european market by 
the end of 1992 such a goal would allow people goods and capital 
to move freely among the countries 
jacques delors president of the european commission the 
communitys executive body led the 17member committee that 
drafted the monetary report 
the committees recommendations would require major changes in 
the way in which the nations conduct economic and monetary policy 
the proposed changes were broken down into three phases 
the ministers agreed community officials should set out what 
needs to be done in the first stage which generally calls for 
greater policy coordination 
they also want more details on the next two stages before 
deciding whether to make changes in the treaty of rome which sets 
the legal foundation for the europeanwide market in 1992 
delors insisted that if the governments make the initial moves 
toward monetary union they must complete the process 
not to do so he said would amount to one more failure on the 
long road to economic and monetary union 
delors asked about londons coolness to the monetary report 
noted there was an internal debate in britain over european unity 
he said he awaited a june summit of community leaders to make 
a final assessment on britains views 
british prime minister margaret thatcher often at odds with 
delors has said the communitys vision of unity would mean a 
superstate of faceless bureaucrats in brussels 
the ministers also welcomed a new proposal for smoothing their 
widely varying valueadded taxes roughly like sales taxes in the 
united states 
common market members are belgium britain denmark france 
germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands 
portugal and spain

gang violence and drug peddling at a 
housing project behind a junior high school show no signs of going 
away so officials are trying to make the campus bulletproof by 
building a 10foot high wall 
faculty and administrators wore tshirts friday bearing the 
great wall of lindbergh logo to show their enthusiasm for the 
160000 project at lindbergh junior high school it is scheduled 
for completion in six weeks 
judy wade a physical education teacher has said shes seen 
beer bottles and even bicycle handlebars tossed at students during 
her 25 years at the school now its not what theyre throwing 
but what theyre shooting she said 
students were evacuated from the recreation fields twice during 
one week in april because of gunfire two years ago a student 
playing basketball after school was hit in the chest by a bullet 
that whizzed through a chainlink fence 
theyve had trouble there for as long as i can remember 
said principal max fraley referring to the problem housing project 
that is adjacent to the schoolyard it is a very large area where 
a lot of drug dealers congregate 
the concrete block wall will extend 300 yards along the schools 
playground separating the school and 1200 students from the 
713unit carmelitos housing project fraley said 
funds for the wall came from the city school district and los 
angeles county after teacher joan reedy was nearly hit recently by 
bullets as she walked with students to a softball diamond 
shots came through the fence and we heard the whizzing by 
ms reedy said i was ok at first but when i got home i was 
scared so i went to the board of education and said something 
needs to be done 
plans call for the wall to be bordered by shrubs and decorated 
with a large mural fraley said 
well use antigraffiti paint something that it will be easy 
to wash the gang graffiti off of he said 
the mural will include a painting of the spirit of st louis 
the airplane aviator charles linbergh flew in 1927 in the first 
solo transatlantic flight and a large l overlapped by a 
picture of an eagle the school mascot 
the slogan lindbergh leads the way will top the mural 
painted in school colors of blue and red 
a 900foot wall of this sort is significant because it 
recognizes the problems we face today and it will make everyone on 
school grounds feel a lot safer fraley said 
the principal said the student who was hit two years ago while 
playing basketball is now in high school and still has the bullet 
in him 
the doctors said it would do more harm to take it out and im 
told he hasnt suffered any ill effects from it after he recovered 
from the gunshot itself fraley said 
the wall is terrific said student joe trejo 13 who lives 
in the carmelitos project next door why because i dont want to 
get shot

a new radar system installed in 1984 
led the coast guard to stop plotting ship movements in the area 
where the tanker exxon valdez ran aground a coast guard commander 
testified saturday 
but cmdr steven mccall told federal investigators that the 
change and a reduction in staff three years later did not 
compromise tanker safety 
mccall the coast guard commander in valdez testified on the 
fifth and final day of a national transportation board hearing on 
the march 24 accident which spilled nearly 11 million gallons of 
oil into prince william sound 
the ntsb panel which has heard testimony from exxon 
representatives members of the tankers crew state officials and 
others probably will not complete its report on the spills cause 
before january said chairman lee dickinson 
the accident called into question the coast guards ability to 
monitor traffic in the sound tankers pick up north slope crude oil 
in valdez where the alaska pipeline ends 
before 1984 the coast guard plotted ship movements on charts 
using reports from vessels the new radar system made that practice 
unnecessary mccall said 
however ship traffic controllers have testified that they could 
not see the exxon valdez on radar before it ran aground and had no 
indication it was in trouble 
the radar system has a range of up to 20 miles but that varies 
with the weather mccall said 
its well within the realm of possibility that the 
controller could have lost a reliable fix the night of the 
accident he said 
the coast guards traffic station in valdez experienced some 
staff cuts in 1987 and some staff members were reassigned but 
there were no major problems mccall said 
the commander confirmed that while the exxon valdez had coast 
guard permission to cross the oncoming traffic lane it did not 
seek or receive permission to leave shipping lanes tanker crew 
members have said they left the lanes to avoid ice and 
acknowledged permission had not been requested 
asked if he thought there was anything the coast guard station 
could have done to prevent the accident mccall said no 
ntsb staff member lou colucciello suggested that the accident 
might have been avoided if the coast guard had notified the tanker 
it was outside shipping lanes 
presumably they already knew that mccall replied 
third mate gregory cousins who was in control of the ship at 
the time of the accident despite not having proper certification 
has said he was aware it was outside shipping lanes 
arguments have raged over the response to the spill which 
stained more than 700 miles of alaskan shoreline and killed 
hundreds of animals especially regarding the use of oildispersing 
chemicals 
mccall said there was no reason for him to take over the effort 
to deal with the spill soon after it happened because equipment and 
other resources were not on hand 
the immediate response was handled by alyeska pipeline service 
co an oil industry consortium that manages the pipeline and the 
valdez marine terminal 
mccall said using dispersants was discussed soon after the 
accident early the morning of march 24 tests of their 
effectiveness were conducted late that afternoon or early that 
evening he said adding that he didnt think there was 
unreasonable delay in performing them 
mccall said alyeska did not have enough dispersant on hand to 
significantly reduce damage by the spill and that tests showed no 
positive effect possibly because oil on the water was still 
pretty thick 
exxon has said the oil would not have spread as much as it did 
if state officials had promptly approved use of dispersants dennis 
kelso alaskas top state environmental official responded that 
permission had been granted before the spill and that alyeska 
didnt have enough dispersant for the job 
during a break in saturdays proceedings kelso attacked oil 
industry testimony as revisionist history the states 
representative at the hearings bob leresche said friday that oil 
industry officials lied under oath 
at a news conference saturday kelso said he would issue an 
order or take other action soon to ensure that the oil industry 
understands it must comply with its spill contingency plans 
kelso said alyeska suggested in testimony friday that its plan 
represented optional guidelines 
the alaska department of law is reviewing the states 
enforcement options including possibly closing the alaska 
pipeline said kelso repeating a threat gov steve cowper made 
soon after the spill 
when it was in alyeskas interest to say that they would do 
the cleanup required by the plan they promised to do so kelso 
said i think the american people are getting really tired of 
hearing exxon and alyeska scrambling to hide from liability by 
making up excuses for why they didnt get the cleanup done 
properly 
exxons representative at the hearing william deppe declined 
to comment 
alyeska spokesman tom brennan said friday that the company 
stands behind its executives testimony

strong shifting winds saturday 
night forced the air force to postpone the launch of a navigation 
satellite designed to tell us and allied forces their location 
within 50 feet anywhere on the globe 
the postponement was announced with the countdown holding at 
just four minutes before the intended blastoff time 755 pm 
the upper level winds are too variable to risk a launch of the 
air force delta 2 rocket through that environment tonight said 
lt col ron rand the air force launch commentator 
the countdown had proceeded perfectly throughout the day while 
weathermen kept a close watch on the upper altitudewinds rand said 
late weather balloon data indicated the velocities and directions 
of shifting winds were too high to be safe wind velocities were 
not reported 
a new launch date was scheduled for 751 pm sunday 
packed in the nose of the 30 million 12story rocket is a 65 
million navstar global positioning system satellite which will 
enable military units such as ships planes submarines and tanks 
to determine their location within 50 feet and in some cases to 
within 10 feet 
the satellite will also keep track of their speed within a 
fraction of a mile per hour and the precise time within a millionth 
of a second 
american and allied military users will receive information from 
a coded channel civilian users who also have access to the 
satellite system will monitor an open channel that will provide 
them with a position accuracy of 300 feet 
the 3675pound navstar gps contains an atomic clock with an 
error rate of one second every 300000 years 
the satellite is the second of 21 upgraded navstars that the air 
force plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992 giving 
anyone anywhere in the world 24hour access to the positioning 
information 
the first advanced navstar was launched aboard the maiden flight 
of the delta 2 on feb 14 
seven earlier model navstar satellites are orbiting the earth 
the new model has more power and improved systems and has added the 
coded military channel 
the delta 2 is a more powerful version of the earlier delta 
rocket that has been flying since 1960 logging 170 successes in 
182 launches 
it is one of at least 54 new unmanned rockets the pentagon is 
ordering in a 14 billion program to resolve a postchallenger 
crisis that left about 40 reconnaissance and other national 
security payloads languishing in storage for want of a launch 
vehicle 
the backlog was created by the grounding of the space shuttle 
fleet for 32 months after the 1986 challenger explosion the 
defense department decided after the accident that it could not 
rely solely on the shuttle for access to space and ordered 
development of the delta 2 and a more powerful titan 4 rocket 
the air force originally had planned to launch all 21 of the 
advanced navstars on the shuttle all now will fly on delta 2s

former sen warren g magnuson a quiet but 
skilled congressional dealmaker who won billions in federal funds 
for his constituents over a 44year career died saturday morning 
at his seattle home he was 84 
magnuson died of congestive heart failure due to complications 
from diabetes said gretchen bakamis a friend and family 
spokeswoman 
he went very peacefully at 645 this morning said his 
wife jermaine magnuson i was at his side we had our hugs and 
our kisses he went with dignity and no pain and thats what i had 
prayed for 
during his more than four decades in congress magnuson built a 
reputation as a potent yet genial wheelerdealer who preferred to 
remain littleknown except by the voters back home who called him 
maggie 
there are showhorses and there are workhorses magnuson once 
said the workhorses usually return the showhorses run into 
trouble 
magnuson was elected to the house of representatives in 1936 and 
won the first of his six senate terms in 1944 he rose to 
chairmanship of the appropriations committee before being defeated 
by republican slade gorton in 1980 his only election loss 
he is one of the most significant individuals this state has 
ever known said gov booth gardner a fellow democrat he is 
an integral part of the history of this state he was well loved 
and appreciated for his contribution 
magnusons rumpled appearance everpresent cigar and constant 
malapropisms belied his reputation as a consummate senate insider 
we used to sit in the cloakroom and smoke cigars and chat 
magnuson said during a visit to washington dc after his 
retirement in my day a fellow didnt introduce a bill of major 
importance without the committee chairmans approval 
now everything is willynilly there isnt the discipline 
there isnt the courtesy there was when i was here 
magnuson played poker in the white house with presidents 
franklin roosevelt and harry truman was a confidant of president 
john kennedy and recruited president lyndon johnson as best man 
for his second marriage 
as appropriations committee chairman magnuson was never shy 
about speaking up for washington state among projects for which he 
won money are the hanford nuclear reservation worlds fairs in 
seattle in 1962 and spokane in 1974 the puget sound naval shipyard

divided federal money 5050 half for washington state and half 
for the rest of the country 
but the liberal magnuson also pushed legislation regulating 
flammable fabrics auto safety cigarette labeling and truth in 
packaging and he was a champion of medical research conservation 
issues the 18yearold vote and measures to make oil vessels safer 
after his 1980 defeat he swore he wouldnt be a lame duck but 
a retired rooster he campaigned successfully for a seattle 
city bond issue for senior housing and was a mainstay at democratic 
fundraisers 
house majority leader tom foley dwash said he was 7 or 8 
years old when he first met thencongressman magnuson in 1936 
maggie was a tremendous model to me of someone who had almost 
unlimited influence on the affairs of the senate and the nation 
but yet always kept this easy casual manner foley said 
magnuson and henry m scoop jackson who died in 1983 were 
known as the gold dust twins together they led a washington 
state congressional delegation that during the 1960s and 1970s was 
known as one of the most influential on capitol hill 
magnuson was a very warmhearted and compassionate person and 
i think he cared more about people in this state than anyone i ever 
knew said helen jackson the late senators wife 
magnusons inability to pronounce names was legendary he once 
called olympics committee legend avery brundage mr average 
brundy and was known to call johnson aide joseph califano joe 
cauliflower 
no one is sure how much was intentional and how much wasnt 
said rep norm dicks dwash who once worked on magnusons staff 
warren grant magnuson was born april 12 1905 in moorhead 
minn and was orphaned before he was a month old he was adopted 
by a swedish couple and took their name 
he attended public schools the university of north dakota at 
grand forks and north dakota state college 
at 17 magnuson rode the rails to seattle he entered the 
university of washington in 1924 and worked his way through school 
delivering ice he graduated with a law degree in 1929 and 
practiced law for a time 
he was elected to the washington state house in 1932 briefly 
served as a us attorney in seattle in 1934 and was king county

hong kong reacted nervously saturday to chinas 
declaration of martial law fearing the move might mean beijing 
will restrict freedoms in this british colony when it comes under 
chinese sovereignty in eight years 
under a chinesebritish agreement signed in 1984 china has 
promised to preserve hong kongs capitalist lifestyle for 50 years 
beyond 1997 under a unique one country two systems formula 
chinese premier li peng declared martial law in parts of the 
capital saturday after authorities were unable to quell massive 
studentled protests for democratic reform 
liberal groups in hong kong condemned the decision urging 
residents to shelve their political differences and support the 
student movement 
they said the failure of the student movement could affect hong 
kongs future and weaken chinas promises to retain the 
freewheeling socioeconomic system that has made the colony a world 
financial center 
if they go against the freedom of human rights hong kong 
people will lose confidence in the chinese government said lam 
waikeung a member of the lawmaking legislative council 
businessmen say hong kongs economy could suffer should the 
situation in china deteriorate further especially if clashes erupt 
between students and the military 
hong kong depends on china for its food and trade and its 
economy and stock market react violently to political developments 
on the mainland 
on friday the hang seng stock index plummeted 13203 points in 
panic selling over news from china including the reported 
resignation of communist party general secretary zhao ziyang the 
moderate zhao had pushed for a compromise with the students 
it was the worst singleday plunge since the worldwide market 
collapse in october 1987 brokers say the market could suffer 
further when it opens monday unless the crisis in china stabilizes 
for hong kongs 57 million residents 98 percent of whom are 
chinese the thought of a future under communism is a haunting one 
an estimated twothirds of them are refugees from china or their 
descendants who fled from despair or political persecution on the 
mainland 
a poll conducted by the conservative englishlanguage south 
china morning post earlier this month said onethird of hong kongs 
population is considering emigrating before the territory reverts 
to china in 1997

police on saturday arrested two protesters 
who scaled a fence surrounding the seabrook nuclear power plant and 
spent six hours atop a tower that supports highvoltage power lines 
the demonstrators hung a banner from two legs of the tower 
urging people to oppose lowpower tests which could start this 
month at the reactor 
seabrook spokesman rob williams denounced the action as very 
irresponsible and dangerous but seabrook police said they saw no 
reason to forcibly remove harry leno 52 of ipswich mass and 
christopher nord 36 of merrimac mass from the tower 
the protesters climbed about 50 feet up the tower but were 
nowhere near the 345000volt power line above them said 
seabrook police sgt david currier 
it was certainly no danger currier said we would have 
simply left them up there until they got tired 
when they came down leno and nord were charged with criminal 
trespass issued summonses and released 
the nuclear regulatory commission gave final approval to a 
lowpower license last week a federal appeals court is reviewing a 
request by seabrook foes to delay the tests 
protests against seabrook have resulted in about 2500 arrests 
since construction began in 1976

about 400 communist party members 
demanding reforms on saturday opened a twoday national conference 
in this southern hungarian city 
it was a followup to an unprecedented meeting in kecskemet on 
april 15 when the reformers questioned the future of the party that 
has ruled the country since the end of world war ii 
gyorgy kerenyi a party leader in eastern hungary said in his 
opening address 
we dont want to leave it the party we want to take it 
over thus paving the way for a massive transformation to bring 
about a selfreliant democratic and socialist party 
the party needs a leadership that both listens to its members 
and lets them decide weve had enough of the sneaky and stealthy 
way of doing politics 
jozsef geczi a representative of the csongrad district said 
hungarys communist party cannot rid itself of the model built by 
josef stalin the late soviet dictator until it changes its own 
internal mechanism and structure 
he said that would require the convening of a special party 
congress next fall 
organizers said the conference was divided into five workshops 
to consider the decades of oneparty rule the transition to a 
democratic constitution and economic policies 
gyorgy kerekes a budapest sociologist said the conference has 
gone well beyond the getacquainted session in kecskemet 
he said members are debating the role of a younger generation 
who want no share of the stigma of the past but want to take 
responsibility for the present and future 
they feel they must either succeed in reforming the party 
within the next few months and put the reformers in the lead or 
failing that quit the party and start an independent leftwing 
political party

plants that turn out hot dogs chicken soup and other processed 
foods using meat and poultry 
but officials of the agriculture department left open the 
possibility they would revive the proposal later on and a meat 
industry spokesman said a consensus might be sought 
since the proposal was announced in november there have been 
many complaints that it would put greater reliance on the plants 
themselves to meet federal inspection standards 
lester m crawford head of the departments food safety and 
inspection service said the proposal was withdrawn at least for 
the time being in direct response to more than 1800 comments 
from the public since it was announced last fall most opposed all 
or parts of the proposal he said the agency will gather additional 
information and then determine if a new plan will be drafted

in 1951 an investor sued his stockbroker after 
losing 3333 on a bum tip about a takeover deal 
the case wilko vs swan tested the limits of mandatory 
arbitration agreements that brokerages typically require to settle 
disputes ruling two years later the supreme court said 
arbitration pacts werent binding under a 1933 federal securities 
law 
the decision stood until last week when the court reversed 
itself closing what was widely viewed as the final window of 
opportunity for an investor to bypass industryrun arbitration 
proceedings and sue a broker 
the 54 ruling means that if an investor signs a contract with a 
brokerage house requiring arbitration in the event of a fraud 
claim a dispute must go to a panel of arbitrators for resolution 
the courts wont listen 
this puts everything in place said william j fitzpatrick 
general counsel for the securities industry association it says 
if you have an arbitration agreement no matter what theory is 
raised or how you peg your claim it goes to arbitration 
the supreme court in 1984 said all state securities law cases 
had to be arbitrated if a signed pact exists in 1987 the court 
applied the same standard to an antifraud section of the federal 
securities exchange act of 1934 
the current ruling applies to a narrower antifraud provision of 
the securities act of 1933 that gives people who buy securities an 
avenue to complain about brokers 
the three rulings cover all bases for how a client can contest a 
brokerdealers behavior 
while the latest decision should clear federal court dockets of 
an estimated 100plus cases in which investors have challenged 
arbitration agreements it wont clear away criticism of a system 
many claim is biased in favor of the securities industry 
in arbitration agreements investors normally waive their right 
to sue and agree that fraud claims will be resolved by a panel of 
arbitrators appointed under federal guidelines by the new york 
stock exchange national association of securities deealers or 
other industry body 
the number of arbitration claims has increased more than 
sevenfold this decade to 6100 in 1988 from just 830 in 1980 
in the nyse system one securities industry arbitrator and two 
from outside the industry conduct a hearing into a claim and can 
issue judgments and award penalties the exchange claims its 
arbitration decisions are about 5050 for investors and brokers 
with 1988 awards ranging from 100 to 2 million 
a recent securities and exchange commission study of nyse cases 
found that arbitration is indeed cheaper and quicker than 
litigation from filing to judgment court cases took about 18 
months vs 12 for arbitration median legal costs were 5100 for 
litigation and 3250 for arbitration but the amount of claims 
recovered did not differ the study found 
the sec last year also found that only 39 percent of cash 
accounts typically used by individual investors at major 
brokerages mandated abitration but more than 95 percent of more 
sophisticated options and margin accounts did 
investor groups complain that brokerages dont always tell new 
clients they cant sue to that end the sec is forcing firms to 
provide more information massachusetts has gone even further 
banning arbitration agreements that prohibit legal action but a 
federal district court blocked the law and an appeals court hearing 
is set for next month 
more than a dozen states are awaiting the outcome of the 
massachusetts case before enacting similar antiarbitration laws 
in other business news this past week 
the dollars sharp rise was slowed but not stopped by central 
bank intervention the currencys relentless strengthening has 
raised concerns about the effectiveness of monetary cooperation 
among key finance ministers 
government economic reports suggested federal reserve efforts 
to slow the economy without causing a recession were working 
cheering the stock and bond markets the labor department said 
consumer prices rose 07 percent in april though the gain was

natural prices had been rising for five years acting as though 
they were headed for the sky wall street was awash in prosperity 
this time the mood is much different brokerage firm layoffs 
make regular headlines and worries abound in the financial world 
about inflation and a possible recession 
in the summer of 87 as it turned out the market had a date 
with disaster starting in late august the dow average fell almost 
1000 points in a matter of eight weeks 
but now the optimists of wall street contend conditions are 
far different from the runaway exuberance that set the stage for 
the crash 
the market appears to be somewhat undervalued using 
priceearning ratios as a gauge argues richard sichel director of 
research at the first pennsylvania bank in philadelphia 
we have come a long way since october of 1987 with the dow 
jones industrials setting postcrash highs on a consistent basis 
there is still ample cash on the sidelines to keep prices up 
and ownership of equities is generally low by historical 
standards 
now that the dow is just a shade more than 200 points below its 
1987 peak of 272242 there is the possibility of a new record 
high this year declares william lefevre at advest inc 
all this has amazed the many skeptics who have been lying low 
since the crash fearful of the economic and financial woes the 
markets slide appared to be foretelling could the recordbreaking 
drop really have been nothing more than an outsized correction 
just a temporary break in a long upward trend 
that view has been collecting more and more believers of late as 
stocks have posted gains in six of the past seven weeks 
the dow jones industrials closed friday at 250110 up 6140 
points from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 379 to 17892 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
722 to 44205 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 553 at 35383 
volume on the big board averaged 19271 million shares a day up 
from 16087 million the week before 
the widely accepted explanation for the markets recent strength 
is growing faith that the federal reserve is succeeding in its 
campaign against inflation fostering a decline in interest rates 
without inflicting any lasting harm on the economy 
with the slowing economy and slowing price inflation we would 
appear to be twothirds of the way toward a soft landing 
observed edward kerschner an analyst at painewebber inc 
the question the market will increasingly address now concerns 
the final onethird of the scenario will earnings hold up 
it appears more and more that this is a different economic 
cycle the soft landing 
but remember if things dont prove different either 
rates dont fall fast enough andor profits dont stay strong 
enough current interest rates suggest the market is 15 percent to 
25 percent overvalued 
the feds seeming success in restraining inflation is very 
favorable for bonds kirschner acknowledges but he says it remains 
to be seen whether it will be as beneficial to the stock market

beer drinkers will see two messages this year 
one telling them alcohol consumption may cause health problems and 
the other claiming beer is as basic as bread 
while the first message will appear on government warning labels 
on alcoholic beverage containers the second will be included in 
advertisements by anheuserbusch cos inc the nations largest 
brewer 
anheuser however is not alone in defending its product in an 
industry battered by concerns over alcohol abuse and drunken 
driving some executives have decided to fight back and tell the 
public that beer not only is safe but has a revered place in 
cultural history 
most of the action has been on the playing field of the 
critics said james sanders president of the beer institute a 
trade association in washington we need to get out of the 
reactive mode and into a proactive mode 
the us beer industry has been stagnant in recent years and 
analysts say one cause has been a changing social attitude toward 
drinking and a greater awareness of alcohols potential hazards 
but industry officials say they have been portrayed too often as 
villains and they say beer can be enjoyed safely if consumed 
responsibly 
beer drinkers are not drug addicts leonard goldstein 
president of miller brewing co said in an april speech to 
wisconsin beer distributors throughout history beer has 
provided lots of enjoyment for millions of consumers 
but he added if ever there was a time for our industry to 
pull together and fight for control of our own destiny that time 
is now 
last december the us surgeon generals office held a workshop 
on drunk driving and issued preliminary recommendations which 
goldstein called an obituary for the alcohol beverage industry 
among them were measures to ban alcohol advertisements by 
celebrities who have a strong appeal to youth and to create 
equal time for public service spots to balance the advertising of 
alcoholic products final recommendations will be included in a 
report due may 31 
also last year congress passed the alcohol labeling law which 
takes effect in november labels on beverage containers will alert 
people to the hazards of drinking while pregnant and warn how 
alcohol can impair the ability to drive or operate machinery 
a major supporter of alcohol labeling has been the center for 
science in the public interest a consumer advocacy group in 
washington the center also has lobbied congress for higher excise 
taxes on alcohol 
were not interested in curtailing all alcohol use in the 
sense of being neoprohibitionists said karen lieberman who 
works on the centers alcohol policies project we want to curb 
alcohol problems 
similarly micky sadoff president of mothers against drunk 
driving said weve never taken a position against alcohol in 
general i drink myself 
were talking about the combination of alcohol and driving 
and flying and boating and snowmobiling 
but beer industry officials who share concerns about alcohol 
abuse and drunken driving have opposed the labeling law as a scare 
tactic 
we think its not a contribution said sanders of the beer 
institute you dont tell the whole story in a couple of words 
you might have young people who think that their parents who 
open a beer at dinner are drug pushers he said 
the beer institute is planning a promotion to give the true 
story of the beer industry sanders said if beer is treated 
with good sense it works itself into a healthy lifestyle 
anheuser based in st louis is expanding its know when to 
say when ad campaign aimed at responsible drinking in addition 
the company will incorporate a message of moderation into another 
campaign to begin running later this year which will trace the 
tradition of beer through history 
one ad will use early american paintings to show how beer was 
brought to america on the mayflower was used to celebrate the 
first thanksgiving and was part of the daily ration for soldiers in 
the american revolution 
a second ad which shows how the art of brewing has passed down 
through centuries contains this line its older than the 
written word and as basic as bread 
it talks about the heritage and the quality of beer said 
steve burrows staff vice president in marketing at anheuser 
weve taken that quality message and put in a responsible 
drinking message 
such promotions could help push the pendulum of public opinion 
in the beer industrys direction said anita rosepka senior editor 
of beverage media a trade publication in new york 
i think the industry has had the attitude that publicity will 
swing back to normal she said but now its the time to do 
something its gone on too long 
their attempts are notable lieberman said referring to the 
beer companies promotions of responsible drinking but their 
messages fall far short 
she said even statements like know when to say when 
encourage some use of the product 
theres no message that abstinence is a serious option she 
said

the economy should stay on a restricted credit 
diet while it works off an inflationary bulge breaking the diet 
now would keep the economy from getting into good shape 
at least thats the view of a number of observers who think the 
time isnt right for the federal reserve board to dole out bigger 
helpings of credit current rations are providing sufficient 
nourishment for the economy to grow without slipping into a 
recession they say 
judging by the mood in the bond market this past week 
professional traders dont necessarily agree with this prescription 
bond prices moved up despite word from the labor department that 
the consumer price index rose 07 percent in april bonds benefited 
from increasing optimism that the fed soon will be able to loosen 
its grip on credit and permit interest rates to fall 
at first glance the unexpectedly large cpi reading looked like 
bad news for bonds but traders quickly overcame their initial 
shock comforted from the realization that much of the thrust 
behind last months inflation rate was fueled by the largest 
gasoline price surge on record 
excluding energy prices which were affected by supply 
disruptions after an exxon oil tanker beached off the alaskan 
coast the cpi rose 02 percent 
in the opinion of economist norman ture president of the 
institute for research on the economics of taxation the special 
factors that elevated the april cpi exaggerated the true inflation 
rate 
its very difficult to see any reason for an inflationary 
resurgence ture says 
he says sentiment in the precious metals market supports this 
view prices of gold a commodity that investors frequently turn to 
as a hedge against inflation dropped late last week to the lowest 
levels in three years 
though he doesnt consider gold prices a reliable gauge of 
inflation expectations michael moran chief economist at daiwa 
securities america inc shares the idea that the worst news on 
inflation this year may be over 
my view on inflation is that well see a very gradual easing 
off of inflation during the course of the year says moran a 
former fed economist 
he says the central banks credittightening actions late last 
year and earlier in 1989 were enough to bring inflation under 
control relaxing the restrictive stance now would risk inflation 
getting out of hand he says 
so the fed mustnt react to recent signs of slower economic 
growth by immediately driving down interest rates says moran 
how should the fed respond to this situation i think they 
should be very cautious in easing monetary policy he says 
if they were to ease off too early we could get a bounce back 
in the economy says moran adding the risk is greater that 
well have a pickup in inflation rather than a recesssion 
recession may be all the more unlikely because the dollars 
recent surge is stimulating economic growth and partly countering 
the negative impact of higher us interest rates 
lacy hunt chief economist at the investment firm cmampm group 
says the strong dollar will spur consumer spending if it hasnt 
already by cutting the price of imported merchandise 
an inflow of foreign money lured by the attractive returns that 
high us rates imply could help rejuvenate the housing and other 
sectors of the economy bruised by rising credit costs hunt says 
for these reasons he says the inflation number was bad but 
it didnt matter because of the surging dollar
