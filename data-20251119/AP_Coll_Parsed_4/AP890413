one of the suspects in a cult of human 
sacrifice pointed out the grave of a 13th body on thursday and 
police ordered him to dig it up badgering him as he reeled from 
the heat and the stench 
youll do it with your hands if you have to one officer 
told sergio martinez after the suspect was handed a pick and shovel 
martinez 22 had been taken back to a ranch near matamoros 
where a dozen bodies were unearthed tuesday he and other suspects 
have told authorities there were 14 bodies buried on the ranch 
in a dramatic public confession wednesday some of the five 
suspects in custody said victims were put to death in rituals that 
were intended to provide a magical shield for members of a 
drugsmuggling ring 
under the gaze of police on thursday martinez went to work 
digging up the new grave and quickly revealed the body of a man in 
his 30s martinez said the man had been buried about four months 
ago 
the suspect asked for a face mask but was told to keep working 
you didnt need one when you buried him an officer said 
however martinez was given a mask minutes later when he said he 
could not dig because of the stench later martinez collapsed and 
asked for water two onlookers with the police helped him complete 
the job 
so far the only victim to be identified was mark kilroy a 
21yearold university of texas premedical student who was 
kidnapped on the streets of matamoros last month during spring 
break 
the suspects have said they killed at the demand of adolfo de 
jesus constanzo whom they called godfather they said 
constanzo 26 and sara maria aldrete 24 called the witch 
believed human sacrifices gave the members of cult protection from 
harm 
cameron county sheriffs lt george gavito said that constanzo 
a cuban who has contacts in miami was last seen tuesday over the 
border in brownsville texas 
a warning that constanzo and ms aldrete might be heading for 
miami was read to police officers there at roll calls thursday but 
at this time were not taking any active stance on it said 
detective marie chaney 
constanzos family was known to live in a middleclass 
neighborhood in the miami area from the late 1970s to 1984 
authorities said 
meanwhile new details emerged about the cult leaders who are 
said to have driven luxury cars and worn expensive clothes bought 
with drug profits 
they had a wealthy lifestyle buying 89 mercedes cash and 
all kinds of luxury cars and telephones and clothing gavito said 
that description may fit the profile of a successful drug 
smuggler but details about ms aldretes life fit no such pattern 
apparently sara was leading a double life as a witch in 
mexico and as a deans honor roll student at texas southmost 
college said sheriffs deputy carlos tapia 
texas southmost college is a twoyear college in brownsville 
with an enrollment of 6500 
ms aldrete a resident alien from mexico was a physical 
education major and was one of 33 students listed in the colleges 
whos who directory in 198788 whos who members are 
nominated by faculty have a grade point average of at least 30 
and are active in campus organizations 
she was also president of the colleges soccer booster club that 
year and recipient of the outstanding physical education 
student award during the current session ms aldrete was 
enrolled in 13 hours of courses including government psychology 
physical education spanish and first aid 
were shocked and astounded that this could go on that a 
student here could be involved in something like this said mike 
gonzalez a spokesman for the school 
cameron county sheriffs officials released photos of the 
constanzo and ms aldrete describing them as extremely 
dangerous 
a search of ms aldretes home in matamoros revealed an altar 
and bloodspatters but no bones or bodies gavito said 
five suspects have been arrested and four talked to reporters 
wednesday two of them saying that constanzo committed most of the 
slayings 
one of the suspects in custody serafin m hernandez of 
brownsville was a law enforcement major at the community college 
he was enrolled in two courses criminal investigation and 
introduction to sociology according to school records 
in matamoros the bodies of the victims were at funeral homes 
waiting to be identified through dental records because of the 
state of decomposition according to oran neck a brownsvillebased 
us customs service agent 
neck said us federal drug agents will be assigned to the case 
he said authorities have learned the group was importing more than 
a ton of marijuana into the united states each week 
it is a little bit larger drug trafficking group than we 
initially anticipated or discovered and the drug enforcment 
administration is joining us in the investigation he said 
neck said us officials were trying to identify a body believed 
to be another american and said that they were working on having 
kilroys body returned to the united states 
at a memorial service for kilroy thursday night the mother of 
the 21yearold university of texas premedical student asked about 
1200 people attending the mass for her son to pray for the drug 
smugglers as well as their victims 
i just ask you to pray for all of the young men who were found 
with him helen kilroy said overflow crowd at st lukes 
catholic church in brownsville 
pray for the people who have done these things helen kilroy 
asked the congreation at st lukes church pray that they are 
caught and that the lord will enter their hearts and they will 
know what they have done is wrong 
pray that they will know there is love 
kilroys father james kilroy said wednesday that he was 
concerned that some murder suspects in mexico are sometimes 
released after paying huge fines but cameron county district 
attorney ben euresti said he believed mexican officials would 
aggressively prosecute the suspects 
im confident that the mexican authorities will handle this 
case properly and that they will be prosecuted accordingly 
euresti said 
a cauldron with a turtle brains and other items were found near 
the graves at the ranch along with bowls containing burned goats 
heads and a mutilated rooster

the ruling sandinista party on 
thursday condemned the us congress approval of a 497 million 
humanitarian aid package for the contra rebels calling it a threat 
to the nicaraguan government 
the sandinista national liberation front on thursday issued a 
communique shortly after the senate vote saying its members 
repudiate the approval of these new funds by the us congress 
for the mercenary forces 
this has violated one more time the rights and the order of 
international justice and makes fun of the will of the central 
american presidents expressed in the document of costa del sol el 
salvador on feb 14 
after a twoday meeting at a resort outside the capital of san 
salvador the presidents of el salvador nicaragua guatemala 
costa rica and honduras agreed to come up with a plan by midmay to 
dismantle the rebel force 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega also promised to push for 
democratic reforms in his country and moved up elections by 10 
months to february 1990 
the statement signed by the fronts nine commanders called the 
humanitarian aid package threats by the us government to apply 
new forms of force against the leftist government 
the aid package was harshly criticized by the sandinista party 
and ortega president bush first unveiled the bipartisan plan to 
provide nonlethal aid to the estimated 11000 contra rebels who 
have been living with their families in honduran border camps since 
congress cut off military aid in february 1988 
ortega has charged any kind of aid to the contras interferes 
with regional peace efforts

an experimental device that takes pictures 
inside blood vessels was used on people for the first time and one 
of its developers sees significant applications for it 
i had two patients today watching us do it dr christopher 
white said wednesday they kept telling me turn the tv so i can 
see it doc 
we had to explain that it was important for us to see the tv 
and wed show them the videotape later 
ochsner medical institutions a suburban new orleans hospital 
that hired white and his partner dr stephen ramee after they got 
out of the army in july is the first to start clinical trials of 
their gadet the percutaneous coronary angioscope 
its of great interest to be able to see the inside of the 
coronary arteries from the outside of the patient so this type of 
device may have important application said dr albert raizner 
director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at the methodist 
hospital in houston and an associate professor at baylor college of 
medicine 
the machine made by advanced cardiovascular systems of mountain 
view calif has been approved for trial by the food and drug 
administration at four other hospitals white said those tests are 
expected to start in the next few months 
fiber optics have been used for at least a decade to look into 
the digestive tract but it was only in recent years that optical 
fibers became small enough to use in blood vessels 
white said the angioscope which he ramee and engineer tom doyle 
designed is smaller than those already on the market so it can get 
into smaller arteries 
its a triple tube of plastic less than onequarter inch wide 
one section holds 2000 extremely thin optical fibers in a bundle 
smaller in circumference than pencil lead a second hollow tube 
carries medicine or saline solution the third holds a tiny balloon 
of the sort now used to flatten cholesterol plaques in a procedure 
called balloon angioplasty 
an xray guidance system is used to route the triple tube from a 
blood vessel at the top of the leg toward the heart once its 
where doctors want it the balloon is filled with liquid and a tiny 
amount of saline may be pumped in to clear away the opaque blood 
that is one of the major refinements of his machine white said 
several japanese machines are on the market he said but they rely 
on flushing salt water through the arteries to clear away the blood 
if the device proves as safe as he expects it could be used to 
see whether a blood clot cholesterol plaque or spasm in an artery 
is causing a heart attack white said each is treated differently 
and doctors cant be certain which treatment should be used he 
said 
it also would let doctors drip medicine to dissolve the clot 
precisely at the spot it was needed and stop the drip as soon as 
the clot disappeared he said

is fidos breath worse than his bite 
if so maybe its time you learned about doggie dental hygiene 
says the new president of the american veterinary dental society 
its a myth that dogs just get doggie breath said dr gary 
goldstein whose organization has grown from 10 members in 1977 to 
850 today 
but if we get their teeth cleaned once a year and brushed 
everyday they wont have doggie breath 
goldstein a veterinarian in houston was elected president of 
the society at the start of this weeks convention of the american 
animal hospital association 
about 1300 veterinarians are attending the conference to hear 
lectures on topics such as anorexia in angoras and pacemakers in 
pugs but pet dentistry according to goldstein is the 
fastestgrowing veterinary care specialty 
dental problems in animals have been around for years 
goldstein said were now just recognizing that theyre problems 
that can be taken care of just about exactly the same thing that 
can be done in human dentistry we can do in animal dentistry 
preventive care includes a daily brushing of a pets teeth with 
a special brush and toothpaste and a professional cleaning and 
checkup each year by a veterinarian more extensive treatment can 
even include braces 
many pet owners are not aware that rovers bad breath may be 
sign of a more serious problem that he needs a root canal or has 
an overbite that makes it difficult to chew properly 
ninety percent of all pets in the united states have some type 
of dental disease goldstein said when i work in the clinics 
it seems like every animal that comes in has some kind of dental 
problem 
nevertheless goldstein has had a problem getting people to take 
pet dentistry seriously even his colleagues have been known to 
chuckle 
if the vets laugh and joke about it then their clients will 
laugh and joke about it and were not getting anywhere goldstein 
said thats why we need to have meetings like this if we cant 
spread the word to vets then certainly their clients arent going 
to be aware theres a problem 
goldstein said the cost of dental treatments such as root 
canals crowns and orthodontics did not seem to deter pet owners 
from getting the work done 
one of the reasons it has blossomed is that animals now are 
more companions than they are just pets he said we need to do 
all we can do to accommodate these people who want the best for 
their animals 
goldsteins start in veterinarian dentistry began when he was 
preparing to graduate from the university of minnesota in 1984 
there had been no lectures on animal dentistry and he noticed that 
the veterinarians he worked with virtually ignored broken teeth and 
other dental problems so noting that the trend in veterinary 
medicine was toward specialization he decided he had found his 
niche 
goldstein does only pet dental work and says hes swamped 
about 90 percent of his work is on the mouths of dogs and cats 
but he has also been called out to the zoo to fill five cavities in 
the mouth of a grizzly bear and to the university of houston to do 
three root canals on the schools mascot cougar 
but promoting preventative dental care for pets is his primary 
concern 
if we can get them on a preventative dental program we can 
extend their lives by two or three years goldstein said

the countrys civil war began its 15th 
year today shaken by the conflicts most relentless artillery 
battles raising fears that the final battle between christians 
and moslems may be looming 
weve never been so far away from a settlement and never so 
much at a loss for future options columnist sarkis naoum wrote 
in the independent annahar daily there isnt even a glimmer at 
the end of the tunnel 
by official estimates which are questionable in a country where 
government authority collapsed years ago more than 150000 people 
have been killed unofficial records put the death toll far higher 
the latest fighting which began march 8 is primarily a 
confrontation between gen michel aoun who commands some 20000 
mainly christian troops in lebanons fractured army versus syria 
and its moslem allies 
aoun the christian prime minister is in a struggle for power 
with salim hoss who formed a moslem cabinet shortly after outgoing 
president amin gemayel named aoun in september the christian 
premier has vowed to drive out the 40000 syrian troops in lebanon 
the renewed fighting ended a twoyear lull in the civil war 
during which lebanons moslem and leftist militias underlined their 
apparently limitless propensity for bloodshed by mauling each other 
in internecine battles 
but as it has repeatedly done in the last 14 years the civil 
war has resumed with a vengeance even by lebanons standards the 
shelling by both sides has been ferocious 
tens of thousands of shells and rockets have rained down on both 
sides in the worst exchanges 100 were exploding every minute in 
the christian sector which has borne the brunt of the violence 
as usual most of the more than 180 people killed and nearly 700 
wounded in recent days have been civilians police said 60 percent 
were christian military casualties have been minimal 
thousands of christians ringed on three sides by hostile forces 
with the mediterranean their main escape route have fled by sea to 
nearby cyprus while moslems drove overland to syria or jordan for 
safety 
for the families left behind huddled in bomb shelters or 
basements with food fuel and power running low there appeared 
to be no end in sight to the civil war that began april 13 1975 
on that day christian gunmen killed 29 palestinians in a bus 
ambush in beirut after an activist of the rightist christian 
phalange party was assassinated 
the origins of the war lie in the christians alarm at the 
growth of the palestinian guerrilla power in lebanon and moslem 
demands for an equal share of power with the christians who had 
dominated lebanon since independence from france in 1943 
at that time the french deemed that the christians mainly 
maronites were the majority but since then the moslems have 
become the majority making up an estimated 55 percent of the 4 
million population the christians have refused to surrender their 
longheld privileges 
since 1975 lebanon has become the battleground for regional 
powers like syria and israel 
the civil war has degenerated into a complex web of overlapping 
conflicts between rival factions that has defied all attempts to 
end the fighting including the illfated intervention of the 
usled multinational force in 1982 
the latest explosion came after aoun reasserting the states 
longlost authority by cracking down on the christians main 
militia sought to extend it to moslem sectors of the divided 
country by blockading illegal militiarun ports that had deprived 
the government of tax revenue 
the moslem druse militia led by warlord walid jumblatt 
retaliated by shelling the christian zone 
the syrians the main power brokers in lebanon came to the aid 
of their leftist allies throwing their military might against the 
christians 
aoun who has long demanded the withdrawal of the syrians and 
the troops they maintain in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate declared a war of liberation to drive the 
syrians out 
on the face of it it is an unwinnable contest aouns motives 
for taking on the syrians and their allies who outgun and 
outnumber the christians beleaguered in their shrunken heartland 
are not clear 
but his objective appears to be to force the syrians into open 
war and draw international attention to a conflict that has raged 
for so long it is hardly noticed 
the arab league has tried to intervene but its efforts to find 
a solution so far have borne little fruit and few expect it to make 
headway 
the french to whom the francophile christians have 
traditionally turned for help the soviets and other european 
powers are pressing the syrians to reach an accomodation with aoun 
president hafez assad of syria cannot be seen to be humbled by 
pulling out of a country he considers part of syrias orbit 
secretary of state james a baker iii has served notice that 
washington plans no new initiative in lebanon 
the united states is still haunted by the deaths of more than 
240 marines killed by a shiite moslem suicide bomber and other 
failures 
the fate of 15 western hostages nine of them american held by 
proiranian shiite extremists may be behind the us reluctance to 
get involved in the lebanese quicksands again

morton downey jr found the shouting 
distasteful phil donahue settled upon an epitaph occasionally 
he went too far and geraldo rivera proclaimed that the real 
geraldo is three different men winchell murrow and merv 
and larry king while wanting no part of their style or 
substance defended their right to be kinky 
the occasion was a raucous 90minute debate wednesday pitting 
the four talkshow stars against luminaries in the print media over 
what constitutes responsible journalism and good taste the 
videotaped show for airing over public television opened the 
annual meeting of the american society of newspaper editors 
a semisubdued downey got outshouted and didnt smoke a single 
cigarette rivera went nosetonose with his critics unbloodied 
this time and donahue who once dressed in drag for a show on 
transvestites didnt skirt the issue 
king rejected the notion that anyone should be reined in its 
a big pie said the usa today columnist and mutual radio and cnn 
television talkshow host geraldos producers may decide they 
want to do a lot of sex on their programs or they want to do 
things that may be kinky suppose they do that so what 
i dont have to watch king said we each set out to do 
our programs same with newspapers theres the new york daily news 
and the new york times and the new york post and the wichita 
paper and usa today and all the americans have is choice 
the program was produced and moderated by former cbs news chief 
fred w friendly now with columbias graduate school of journalism 
he started the fireworks by showing an excerpt from a program 
rivera did on sex surrogates and telling his former student it 
seems to me that what youre concentrating on is that kinky 
business 
rivera i do lots of different programs you are talking 
about 10 percent of what i do 
friendly mr rivera i looked at a hundred of your programs 
i could have run a hundred of them and made the same point 
what are you mr rivera friendly asked 
im a compassionate man said rivera 
q who are your role models 
a theres a lot of walter winchell in what i do theres 
also edward r murrow and merv griffin 
friendly thats quite a combination 
jack nelson washington bureau chief of the los angeles times 
snapped that rivera and the others are more show biz than you are 
journalists 
rivera shot back this is arrogant this is hypocrisy he 
demanded to know how much of the criticism of socalled trash 
television is based on pure parochialism how much of it is based 
on the fact that i am your competition 
nelson i dont think youre a journalist 
donahue explain the difference 
nelson well i go out and i try to find out what i can that i 
think is important for society to know for society to act on 
downey youre a snob 
tom shales television critic for the washington post said 
were not talking about whats journalism and whats not 
journalism were talking about whats good taste and whats bad 
taste whats good manners and whats bad manners and i think 
television now is overrun with bad taste and bad manners 
the audience was shown another excerpt from downeys program 
in which a young member of the audience challenged the hosts views 
on prison furloughs by noting that one of the central tenets of 
christianity is forgiveness 
downey was shown retorting that let me tell you something 
more people have been killed in the name of jesus theyve all 
been killed by guys like you downey and the young man wound up 
screaming murderer at one another 10 times over downey 
concluded the segment by raising his arm and inviting the youth to 
suck my armpit 
friendly did you really give that young man a chance to be 
heard 
downey absolutely what am i supposed to do write bland 
headlines on the 17th page of a newspaper 
downey said he is an advocate not a host i was raised in 
the generation of rock n roll and we heard the lyrics over the 
music the older folks here dont seem to be able to hear the 
lyrics 
nelson said the most reprehensible thing i see on any of these 
programs is mort downey smoking his cigarette on television 
downey who couldnt smoke during the show because of rules 
governing the hall replied thats the mentality of the 
superliberal 
king if morton downey wishes to commit suicide that is his 
prerogative 
downey to nelson youd love for me to drop dead because it 
would be sensational for your newspaper 
the capacity audience of about 500 newspaper publishers and 
executives also viewed the donahue segment in which he donned a 
skirt 
friendly taunted him about that noting he once admired donahue 
for the way he handled shows earlier in his career people have 
come to see you as a role model and now youre making a fool of 
yourself said friendly 
donahue replied that i do not apologize for wanting to draw a 
crowd im as interested in ratings as the people in the room are 
interested in circulation he added i cannot be the bbc part 
of my job is to attract an mtv music television audience 
besides said donahue i think its a pretty good epitaph for 
somebody occasionally he went too far 
toward the end virtually all the panelists were trying to be 
heard over each other i find it extremely distasteful said 
downey to listen to shouting 
friendly in a notsoveiled reference to a geraldo episode 
said i cant break peoples noses to stop them

sen edward kennedy says his legislation to 
require employers to provide health insurance for workers has a 
better chance for passage this year because the plight of the 37 
million uninsured has received so much attention 
my sense is the country is prepared to come to grips on 
this the massachusetts democrat said wednesday theres a 
great deal of anxiety among the american people 
last year legislation sponsored by kennedy in the senate and 
rep henry waxman dcalif in the house was met with strong 
opposition in the business community and went nowhere the senate 
labor and human resources committee which kennedy chairs approved 
the measure but it never got to the floor in the house it never 
got out of committee 
kennedy and waxman announced new legislation on wednesday that 
builds on last years bill incorporating provisions requiring 
employers to provide health insurance for workers and phasing in an 
expansion of the medicaid program to cover the nonworking poor 
the measure they say will provide health insurance to all 
americans by 1999 
kennedy estimated the federal cost of the medicaid expansion at 
about 5 billion over 10 years and states would have to match the 
federal contribution businesses would face about 18 billion in 
new costs but subsidies and lowercost insurance pools would be 
available to help small businesses 
benefits would be essentially the same as the basic package 
employers would be required to offer including physician services 
hospital services diagnostic tests pregnancy and wellbaby care 
and a limited mental health benefit under the measure 
the measure has been endorsed by 100 organizations representing 
organized labor health care providers women consumers and 
religious groups however businesses are expected to oppose the 
bill as they did last year 
an estimated 24 million of the americans without health 
insurance are members of working families and would be covered 
under the kennedywaxman bill employers would be required to 
provide the basic package of benefits to employees working more 
than 17 hours per week and to their families 
the bill sets limits on copayments deductibles and the 
employee share of the premiums and provides coverage for 
catastrophic illness it also would not allow anyone to be denied 
insurance because of an existing medical condition 
addressing some of the concerns that were raised last year 
kennedy rejected arguments that it would hurt businesses 
economically and the country competitively 
in fact the legislation will help not harm american 
businesses in world markets he said most of the manufacturing 
companies involved in international trade already provide insurance 
for their workers but these businesses pay too much for health 
insurance because others pay too little he said 
waxman added what we need to do is spread the cost of 
covering workers across all employers and spread the risk of 
illness fairly among insurance companies 
for those not eligible for jobbased insurance the medicaid 
program would be expanded gradually beginning in 1991 with the 6 
million uninsured poor americans not now eligible for the 
federalstate insurance program 
the second phase would begin in 1996 and include the near poor 
whose income are within 185 percent of the poverty line these 
people would pay a share of the cost of their coverage 
a final phase would begin in 1999 to cover the remaining 
uninsured

a bill that would give more teeth to the 
consumer product safety commission and let it do business at less 
than full strength is making progress in a house committee but 
faces business opposition 
the bill sent to the energy and commerce committee on wednesday 
by a subcommittee would specify a quorum of two when there are 
only three members on the commission it has the support of major 
consumer groups 
currently the commission has five authorized members and the 
quorum is three in recent years congress has appropriated money 
for only three salaries so when there is a vacancy as there has 
been since january the two remaining members can do nothing 
some republicans on the commerce consumer protection and 
competitiveness subcommittee sought to sidetrack the bill 
sponsored by chairman james florio dnj in favor of an 
amendment providing straightforward renewal of existing authority 
this bill is opposed by every business group that has 
commented on it said rep howard c nielson rutah sponsor of 
the amendment which was defeated 74 before the subcommittees 
voicevote approval of florios measure 
nielson said florios bill was too cumbersome and had little 
chance of passage 
the bill would also 
let consumers petition the commission for safety rules and 
would require decisions on them within 120 days 
let state attorneys general and certain other state officials 
duplicate federal lawsuits brought by the commission 
require reports studies or decisions about the flammability of 
sleepwear used by the elderly standards for reclining chairs 
safety of cigarette lighters indoor air pollution and age 
requirements for operators of amusement park rides 
a similar bill was approved by the subcommittee and the parent 
committee last year but action was too late in the session for 
consideration by the house 
the commission has been operating on yeartoyear authority 
granted in appropriations bills since 1983 
nielson said deaths from products under the commissions 
jurisdiction fell from 26000 in 1975 to 22000 in 1984 and the 
per capita decline has been more dramatic because the population 
has grown i dont think there is any evidence the commission is 
not doing its job he said 
supporting florio rep james c slattery dkan said for 
those people who dont think we need a vigorous cpsc they ought to 
spend an hour in a toys r us store with a child

a consumer advocate says the outlook for the 
1989 harvest is so grim that the government should suspend export 
subsidies despite their popularity with wheat farmers 
rodney e leonard executive director of the private nonprofit 
community nutrition institute said wednesday he wrote agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter on april 3 to repeat a similar request 
made last fall when the situation was less precarious and 
steps could have been taken to safeguard supplies 
the institute studies nutrition and food policy issues 
the target of leonards complaint is the export enhancement 
program or eep which subsidizes the sale of wheat and other 
commodities to selected foreign countries huge sales of wheat to 
china and the soviet union have been made under the program since 
the arrangement was authorized by congress in the 1985 farm law 
subsidies at one time ranged to more than 40 per metric ton or 
approximately 109 per bushel from less than 20 per ton or 
about 54 cents per bushel lately reflecting generally higher 
world prices the subsidies have been even lower with shipments to 
china recently carrying eep subsidies of 633 per ton or 17 cents 
per bushel 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
yeutter said this week the program had helped significantly in 
getting agricultural trade discussions moving under the current 
uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
but yeutter also said in an interview with a group of reporters 
on monday that the subsidy program would be reviewed to see how 
effective it has been and whether too much or too little is 
being spent on it 
leonard said that the condition of the winter wheat crop is 
deteriorating and that experts in the agriculture department and in 
the major production areas point to a harvest this year of about 
16 billion bushels a spring wheat output of 600 million bushels 
would make a total us wheat harvest of about 22 billion bushels 
if wheat use in the 198990 marketing year which will begin 
june 1 totals in the range of 24 billion to 25 billion bushels 
this years harvest would fall short of meeting demand 
in that case leonard said in his letter to yeutter at least 
200 million bushels of wheat will have to be drawn from existing 
stocks which are estimated by the agriculture department to be 
drawn down to 549 million bushels by june 1 
thus he said the us wheat stockpile by june 1 1990 could 
well be down to around 300 million bushels according to department 
records that would be the the smallest us wheat reserve at the 
end of a marketing year since 1952 when it was 256 million bushels 
this is hardly adequate as a domestic reserve and will leave 
the us unable to intervene if famine conditions develop anywhere 
in the world leonard said the united nations food and 
agriculture organization a month ago said that world grain 
stocks will be drawn down again in 198990 for the third year in a 
row 
leonard added in effect fao does not expect food grain 
production to increase significantly in any of the major 
foodproducing areas outside the us 
the departments first official estimate of 1989 winter wheat 
production which usually accounts for threefourths of the us 
total will be released may 11 
meanwhile department analysts have used unofficial projections 
showing that the 1989 wheat harvest could be as low as 23 billion 
bushels or slightly more than leonards benchmark 
the biggest problem is in major areas of the great plains 
particularly in kansas the no 1 wheat producer where soils have 
been parched since the crop was planted last fall 
yeutter is scheduled to tour some of the kansas wheat area on 
friday his office said there has been congressional pressure on 
the department to extend 1988 drought relief to the stricken winter 
wheat farmers

new projections by the agriculture department 
show the european economic community continues to push grain 
exports aggressively with shipments expected to be at a record 
level this year 
an analysis released wednesday by the departments foreign 
agricultural service said eec exports of wheat and coarse grains 
such as barley and corn are expected to total 333 million metric 
tons in 198889 up 39 percent from 239 million tons last year 
the international trade years begin on july 1 for wheat and oct 
1 for coarse grains a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is 
equal to 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans or 395 bushels of corn 
wheat exports by the eec are at a record 21 million tons up 
from 153 million in 198788 
but the coarse grains mostly barley also have also grown 
forecast at 123 million tons against only 86 million tons last 
year 
over the past seven years subsidized barley exports by the 
eec have jumped by 150 percent the report said while eec 
barley exports comprised less than 30 percent of world barley trade 
as recently as the early 1980s their share is now almost 60 
percent a growth in exports that has come at least partially at 
the expense of us coarse grain market share 
the united states the worlds leading grain exporter was 
forecast to have total wheat and coarse grain shipments of 1034 
million tons in the current trade years up from 969 million tons 
in 198788 a 7 percent increase

president bushs proposal to ban campaign 
contributions by political action committees is one of those offers 
that sounds great politicians forgoing money in the name of good 
government 
and special interest money at that as the political action 
committees have become known 
his motive however is probably not so pure the fact is 
bushs proposal reflects the growing recognition among republicans 
that the system of contributions by political action committees has 
backfired on the party 
it is primarily congressional incumbents who are benefiting from 
the pac contributions and because more incumbents are democrats 
than republicans democrats are getting the bigger share of the 
money 
bush proposed doing away with the pac contributions in effect 
doing away with the pacs at a meeting of the american society of 
newspaper editors in washington on wednesday he offered the 
suggestion as he released a broader ethics package designed to 
tighten rules for congress judges and the executive branch 
pacs weaken the parties restrain competition and deaden the 
political debate bush said 
political action committees are one of the products of the 
postwatergate campaign reforms and are a prime example of the law 
of unintended consequences 
they are a multimilliondollar enterprise that virtually no one 
is happy with critics say they skew the political system in favor 
of the narrow interests they represent and make incumbents even 
harder to dislodge from office 
the pacs are committees organized around officers and employees 
of corporations businesses trade associations and the like whose 
members make contributions that are collected together and donated 
to candidates 
republicans originally saw the pacs as a businessoriented 
republican answer to the contributions democrats were getting from 
labor unions 
as the amounts of money have grown in politics so have the 
pacs in the 1988 election cycle according to the federal election 
commission pacs contributed more than 151 million to house and 
senate candidates a decade earlier their contributions totaled 
onefifth that 
with their growth however has come an unmistakable trend the 
pac managers increasingly have decided that rather than providing 
campaign contributions to challengers with whom they might share 
some views and who often are badly in need of money theyd rather 
put their money on the candidate who is more likely to win 
in nearly all cases thats an incumbent 
and the pacs tend to favor the committee chairmen and 
subcommittee chairmen who are entrenched in office and have power 
over their areas of interest 
in 1988 incumbents got 118 million of the pac contributions 
challengers got less than 19 million the rest went to candidates 
for open seats 
for democratic candidates for the house and senate pacs made 
close to 99 million in contributions for republicans there was 
less than 61 million 
pacs can give up to 5000 per election to a candidate but can 
spend unlimited amounts on their own in a candidates behalf 
and who were the top recipients last year in the house it was 
democrat richard gephardt one of the presidential hopefuls and 
hardly an endangered candidate in his house reelection battle in 
the senate it was texas sen lloyd bentsen the democratic vice 
presidential nominee who easily won reelection to the senate 
doing away with pacs has support among democrats too but many 
democrats want to do so as part of a bigger move to public 
financing of congressional campaigns just as the presidential 
general election campaign is financed with taxpayer money 
bush said he opposed public financing 
many republicans have been advocating an alternative that would 
be more to their liking instead of providing public financing 
they would strengthen the role of the parties by lifting the limits 
on individual contributions to the political parties 
individuals can now give no more than 1000 per election to a 
candidate but they can give 20000 annually to a party and 
advocates of this plan would like to see even larger amounts 
bush didnt add that idea to his proposal to the editors but he 
suggested it 
modern democratic government works best when organized by 
strong political parties and yet we have allowed our parties to 
become weakened and overshadowed by special interests bush said 
and we can best restore the role of the parties by limiting 
political action committees 
small wonder he would want to see more influence for the 
parties contributions to the republican party and its house and 
senate campaign committees regularly dwarf those going to the 
democratic counterparts the republicans easily raise four or five 
times what the democrats raise in this type of contribution and 
the republicans had a 100 million lead over the democrats in 1984

barbara bush says she feels fine after a 
radioactive thyroid treatment and will continue life as usual 
except that she cant hold her grandchildren or puppies in her lap 
or kiss anyone for 72 hours 
looking fit after a reception with the queen of sweden mrs 
bush told reporters wednesday i feel wonderful 
that morning the first lady underwent a common procedure for her 
recently diagnosed graves disease she drank a radioactive iodine 
solution to deactivate her thyroid gland which was producing 
excess levels of hormones 
talking to a handful of reporters after standing in a halfhour 
receiving line and speaking at the reception she complained that 
news coverage of her health was overshadowing the issues she wanted 
to focus on such as queens silvias work on behalf of the 
disabled 
will you stop it she implored the reporters 
she jokingly pretended to be infirm staggering up to the 
reporters and leaning on the arm of her press secretary then she 
told the group i could indian wrestle any one of you to the 
ground 
she said she swam a mile thursday and monday and played tennis 
on wednesday and hoped to keep exercising to keep off the 21 
pounds that the disease had caused her to lose 
in reference to the weight loss she said i like half of my 
disease in fact i love half of it 
she said she had wanted to wear an eye patch or arrive in a 
wheelchair just to tweak the press but her press secretary nixed 
the prank 
during a twohour visit to walter reed army medical center mrs 
bush sipped the radioactive solution through a straw and said it 
tasted like water 
she also had her eyes examined and they were found to have no 
damage from the disease which had caused some eye irritation she 
said 
her condition can cause the eyes to keep opening and water so 
it looks weird mrs bush said 
she anticipates no aftereffects from the radiation treatment 
except an eventual slight neck pain she said the doctors also 
told her not to hold her dogs new puppies or her 11 grandchildren 
for 72 hours because their thyroids are small and more susceptible 
to any effects of radiation 
mrs bush said doctors led her to believe that was just a 
precaution and may have been almost an old wives tale 
the bushes canceled a weekend trip to kennebunkport maine but 
aides said it was unrelated to mrs bushs condition resulting 
instead from visits by family members to washington this weekend 
as well as the presidents desire to stick around while budget 
talks are nearing conclusion with congress 
mrs bushs press secretary anna perez said the first lady joked 
throughout her visit to the hospital 
after the radiation treatment takes effect and deactivates her 
thyroid gland probably in two to three months mrs bush will have 
to take daily medication to maintain adequate hormone levels said 
ms perez 
for several weeks mrs bush has been taking methimazole to 
block production of excess hormones and will continue to take it 
until blood levels of thyroid hormones fall below normal levels 
she then will switch to a thyroid hormone replacement 
supplement ms perez said

us attorney general dick thornburghs 
suggestion that prosecutors seek the death penalty in some 
drugrelated murders in the district of columbia is ridiculous 
the chief of the trial division of the public defenders service 
says 
the death penalty would not deter drug dealers from pursuing 
their lucrative but dangerous business mark rochon said wednesday 
these guys are running around with death contracts on them and 
they are still out hustling rochon said the fact of the 
matter is these are people who have chosen to go into a 
violenceprone way of living and they federal officials think 
two or three deaths a year is going to deter them it would be 
funny if it werent so ridiculous 
a record 372 persons were killed in the city in 1988 and police 
have said 80 percent of the deaths were drugrelated the district 
is headed for another record total in 1989 
thornburgh on monday said us attorney jay stephens has the 
power to identify cases for federal prosecution under the new death 
penalty statute enacted last fall as part of the 1988 antidrug 
abuse act the bill allows the death penalty for the murder of a 
law enforcement officer during narcotics trafficking and for 
homicides committed by drug kingpins 
metropolitan police department spokesman walt ferguson said 
police chief maurice turner jr who in the past has expressed 
support for the death penalty is in the process of reviewing 
statutes and other ins and outs of the legislation 
the dc council struck the death penalty law from the citys 
criminal code in 1980 joining 13 other states that forbid capital 
punishment 
stephens said the death penalty would be employed in the 
district only after very careful scrutiny and review the 
justice department is developing guidelines to screen cases in 
which the death penalty might be sought he said

a homeless man was charged wednesday with 
nine counts of murder after telling police he set a fire that swept 
through an apartment house killing seven children and two young 
mothers a prosecutor said 
joe pickens 34 who has no permanent address was charged in 
the tuesday fire the deadliest in the history of this central 
illinois city of about 130000 people said peoria county states 
attorney kevin lyons 
pickens was charged with criminal trespass a misdemeanor just 
hours after fire 
but lyons said murder charges were lodged after pickens 
confessed to setting fire to a sleepersofa on the first floor 
igniting a fastmoving fire that swept up a stairwell to the second 
floor where three families slept 
initially he claimed the fire was set accidentally said 
police chief allen andrews he subsequently admitted he had 
deliberately set the fire 
following pickens brief court appearance circuit judge robert 
barnes set bond at 2 million and scheduled a hearing for may 5 
authorities said pickens had been arrested several times on 
misdemeanor vagrancy and criminal damage to property charges in 
recent years 
pickens should have been in jail at the time the fire was set 
but had ignored a judges order march 31 to begin serving a 30day 
sentence for resisting arrest his 22nd misdemeanor conviction 
since 1983 the peoria journalstar reported in thursdays edition 
claudie garner who lives across the street from the burned 
building said she knew pickens pretty well 
hed get violent when he was under the influence of alcohol 
she said otherwise he was a nice fellow 
andrews said after pickens set the fire he went to the police 
station and asked officers whether there were any outstanding 
warrants for his arrest after being told there were none pickens 
simply left andrews said 
fire chief g john parker had said pickens apparently stayed at 
the twostory woodframe home in the past and was put out of the 
house monday night but he came back 
parker said he did not know why pickens had been forced to

pm monday returned later and remained in the firstfloor

three survivors of the blaze and a daughter who died in the fire 
authorities believe ms barnes had moved in with the families

investigation revealed the fire began near a space heater on the 
first floor he said electrical service in the downstairs apartment

three hundred department store workers 
were fired for their oneday walkout in support of a twoweekold 
strike by bauxite and sugar workers who are protesting 
governmentmandated austerity measures 
the measures imposed on this englishspeaking country of 750000 
on the northeast coast of south america included a 230 percent 
devaluation of guyanas dollar and the doubling of interest rates 
to 35 percent 
the measures were adopted by the government of president desmond 
hoyte to meet conditions set by the international monetary fund for 
a 19 billion aid package to revive the countrys economy which 
hasnt grown in 10 years 
fourteen protesters including two jesuit priests jailed tuesday 
for picketing outside parliament buildings were released wednesday 
by police the arrests brought to 100 the number of people jailed 
for demonstrating against the measures since hoyte announced them 
on march 31 
while there has been no violence in the protests about 300 
department store workers who paralyzed the capitals commercial 
sector by staging a oneday walkout tuesday were fired when they 
returned to work wednesday authorities said 
the strike by 5000 bauxite workers 20000 sugar workers and 
800 university employees including professors entered its second 
week sugar and bauxite which is used to make aluminum are among 
the countrys main exports 
government spokesman christopher nascimento said union leaders 
calling for strikes were hurting themselves because in attempting 
to bring the economy to a halt they will not hurt the government 
but the nation as a whole 
with the measures guyanas dollar officially fell to 33 to the 
us dollar although it fetches up to 50 to a us dollar in the 
black market 
prices already high before the measures have soared a loaf of 
bread costs about 5 
the government tried to offset the devaluation with a 20 percent 
wage increase but union leaders say that will not make a difference 
in workers paychecks

the prosecution portrayed oliver north as 
working in a den of thieves while north defended president 
reagans advisers as honorable men even as they desperately 
tried to cover up the irancontra affair 
describing the frantic hours of nov 21 1986 north testified 
wednesday that he witnessed his boss national security adviser 
john poindexter rip a presidential finding in two the finding 
retroactively legalized a ciaassisted november 1985 weapons 
shipment to iran 
did you ever think im in a den of thieves prosecutor 
john keker asked north who was on the witness stand in his 
criminal trial for a fifth day 
no mr keker i never regarded that i was working in a 
den of thieves replied north i honestly believed i was 
working for honorable men who were trying to do their level best 
to make this country a better place 
the same day that poindexter tore up the finding norths 
exboss robert mcfarlane reminded him to alter six memos to hide 
mcfarlanes and north thought reagans knowledge of norths 
secret assistance to the contras north made the alterations a 
year after mcfarlane had first asked him to do so 
at any time on nov 21 1986 did you think what you had 
been asked to do might be wrong said keker 
no north said not for one fleeting moment 
north said what mcfarlane wanted removed from the documents 
was language that would indicate his knowledge or the presidents 
knowledge about my activities in this time frame 
the previous day north poindexter cia director william casey 
and others went over proposed congressional testimony which denied 
any us knowledge of the november 1985 arms shipment to iran until 
1986 north said nearly everyone at the meeting knew that to be 
false 
a few days earlier mcfarlane had changed a chronology of the 
iran arms sales by omitting all references to the november 1985 
shipment according to north 
north contended that the deception was necessary to protect the 
lives of us hostages held in iran the iranians were unhappy with 
the hawk missiles in the shipment sent through israel and 
disclosing the us connection could result in retribution north 
testified 
told by poindexter that the attorney general at reagans 
request was launching a factfinding inquiry into the iran arms 
sales north on nov 21 1986 engaged in extensive document 
shredding 
did you begin destroying everything you could get your hands 
on keker asked 
i left 80 boxes of documents behind retorted north i did 
not try to destroy everything i could get my hands on 
his former secretary fawn hall has testified that north 
destroyed more than a years worth of computer messages that day 
north testified that in the previous month he started to clean 
up at the request of cia director william casey 
north said he destroyed records tracking secret assistance to 
the contras and the diversion of funds to the rebels from the iran 
arms sales he also got rid of a ledger showing how he had spent 
300000 kept in his office safe he now is accused of converting 
4300 of that money to his own use 
the finding poindexter had torn up described the 1985 shipment 
of hawk missiles to iran as a straight armsforhostages swap the 
december 1985 presidential finding authorizing it was a potential 
political disaster for a president who had vowed never to negotiate 
with terrorists 
north said he had been placed in an impossible position 
reagans top advisers wouldnt allow the finding justifying the 
1985 hawk shipment to become public because it was a political 
embarrassment he said they were leaving a heckuva pickle for 
the people left behind to explain the arms transfer which 
without the finding was probably illegal 
north is accused of 12 criminal charges including shredding and 
altering documents in november 1986 and creating a false chronology 
about the november 1985 hawk shipment

government sources say the bush administration 
may replace social security commissioner dorcas r hardy a reagan 
appointee whose travel and hiring records are being scrutinized by 
congressional critics 
sources in the bush administration and on capitol hill said 
wednesday that the administration is seriously considering 
replacing hardy with gwendolyn king a former legislative aide to 
sen john heinz rpa king has also headed the washington office 
of attorney general dick thornburgh when he was governor of 
pennsylvania 
none of the sources would be identified by name 
reached at the government relations firm of gogol amp associates 
where she is executive vice president king said i will be 
pleased to serve wherever the president needs me she declined to 
discuss the social security post 
hardy 42 worked for ronald reagan on welfare issues when he 
was governor of california and was a health and human services 
assistant secretary during his first presidential term before being 
named to run social security in 1986 
although bush took office jan 20 hardy has not yet been told 
whether she will be retained according to agency spokesman phil 
gambino 
like all political appointees from the reagan administration 
she was asked to submit her resignation after bush became 
president but it has not been accepted gambino said 
as the administration deliberates on a successor a house panel 
has been looking both into hardys travel and her hiring of a 
handful of former political appointees as consultants 
it was not clear whether the investigation was a factor in the 
administrations decision to seek a replacement for hardy 
in the last three weeks health and human services secretary 
louis sullivan has received two letters from a house government 
operations subcommittee as part of an inquiry into whether hardy 
combined business trips with vacations or political travel the 
subcommittee declined to release the letters 
hardy declined several requests to be interviewed 
however gambino said in the 13 years since ive been here 
three other commissioners have been asked for travel information 
its not unusual 
he said hardys job frequently required travel and not always 
in the united states last summer for example he said hardy was 
asked by the state department to brief officials in china on 
americas social security system and that she stopped in hawaii 
for 24 hours as a natural progression 
hhs has turned down a few trips proposed by hardy according to 
tom burke a private consultant who was chief of staff under former 
secretary otis r bowen however burke said lots of people got 
their trips turned down we just questioned the need for them 
shes not at the top of the list 
the subcommittee has also been looking at four or five ssa 
employees who were immediately rehired as consultants by hardy 
after the administration asked them to step down because they were 
political appointees 
rep ted weiss dny the subcommittee chairman has been a 
frequent critic of hardy most recently he accused the social 
security agency in december of failing to speedily implement a law 
requiring it to help homeless people receive benefit checks 
hardys efforts to trim the agency through computerization and 
staff cuts brought periodic protests from capitol hill lawmakers 
have expressed concern about the cuts in view of the increased 
caseloads brought on by new tax and immigration laws 
on monday hardys program to implement a national telephone 
number to field social security questions was criticized by two 
federal employee groups which said she created sweatshop 
conditions for workers and was insensitive to callers needs 
hardy said the system was still being smoothed out and that it 
would ultimately make the agency more accessible to millions of 
americans she has said automation may be trying for some 
employees but that it makes the agency more efficient

politicians battling to regain the publics trust 
as scandal rages around them are frequently quoting an old japanese 
saying the next step ahead is darkness 
never in the liberal democratic partys 34year rule has the 
popularity of its leader fallen so low and never have so many of 
its elite been accused of dirty dealing 
but in the crisis prime minister noboru takeshita is displaying 
a surprising ability to survive 
takeshita 65 has rejected opposition demands to step down and 
top liberal democrats refuse to submit former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone to questioning under oath in parliament 
instead they have focused on bringing about ethical reforms and 
resuming deliberations on the fiscal 1989 budget the opposition 
has boycotted the budget talks since march 8 
that battle will come to a head later this month when fiscal 
deadlines must be met but party secretarygeneral shintaro abe 
already has suggested the conservatives will use their majority in 
both houses to simply force the budget through a move bound to 
spark criticism in consensusconscious japan 
very few members of the ruling party say takeshita should be 
dumped before the budget is passed said analyst asao yamaguchi 
but afterward the wind will blow in the other direction 
yamaguchi said that by unilaterally passing the budget 
takeshita would be left with no other political choice than to 
dissolve the lower house and call elections this summer when 
polling for half the seats in the upper house is scheduled a loss 
at the polls then would likely end his administration 
behind the conservatives dilemma is the recruit co a huge 
publishing conglomerate recruit sold unlisted shares in a 
realestate subsidiary to about 160 political business and 
government officials at low prices in 1986 the buyers received 
handsome profits when the shares soared in value shortly after they 
were listed on the market 
in all 14 people have been arrested on bribery and other 
charges and three takeshitaappointed cabinet ministers have 
resigned in connection with the scandal 
along with takeshita abe and nakasone former finance minister 
kiichi miyazawa and michio watanabe pegged as a future party 
leader all have been implicated in recruit share transactions 
on tuesday takeshita went before a special session of the lower 
house budget committee to acknowledge that from 1985 to 1987 he 
received about 1 million in donations from recruit and its 
subsidiaries 
the admission was an attempt to clear his name he claimed the 
donations were all legal and was hailed by party leaders 
but takeshita whose support in recent public opinion polls has 
fallen below 10 percent faces other problems 
his pet project a controversial new 3 percent sales tax went 
into effect april 1 raising consumer prices in a nation that 
already has one of the worlds highest costs of living 
liberalization of agricultural imports has alienated some farmers 
one of the conservatives main support groups 
there are many voices within the party calling for the top 
leader to be replaced said keiichiro nakamura a former aide to 
the late prime minister takeo miki 
nakamura told the associated press the critics are still a 
minority but with elections this summer drawing near more and 
more members of the party are realizing that with takeshita as 
their leader they will not be able to be reelected 
he said takeshitas successor must be recruitclean and with 
heads of major factions linked to the scandal the most likely 
candidate is masayoshi ito 75 chairman of the partys executive 
council 
other analysts speculate that former prime minister takeo 
fukuda 84 whose protege is abe may succeed takeshita even 
takeshita mentor shin kanemaru 74 has been mentioned as a 
possible heir 
all are thought of as interim prime ministers who would hold the 
reins only until a new younger leader could be found 
this is the most important political crossroads since the end 
of world war ii said takako doi head of the largest opposition 
party the socialists 
but opposition parties are far apart on policy and they also 
have been tarred by the recruit scandal 
the former head of the democratic socialist party said he would 
not seek reelection after being linked to the affair a socialist 
legislator has resigned and a former deputy secretarygeneral of 
the komeito or clean government party has acknowledged his 
brother bought shares 
there is speculation that rebels might leave the liberal 
democrats and form a new party one restive group of party hawks 
headed by legislator shizuka kamei has demanded the resignation of 
all politicians who received recruit funds 
but analyst yamaguchi said such a breakaway would never happen 
it takes money to form a new party and very few people are 
willing to contribute in times like these he said

members of the house hunger committee say 
theyre concerned a lack of trucks planes and barges will keep 
emergency faminerelief supplies from reaching hundreds of 
thousands of starving sudanese caught in the african countrys 
civil war 
four members of the house select committee on hunger recently 
returned from a trip to africa where they said agreements were 
reached to deliver food and other supplies into the southern part 
of sudan 
weve gotten people to agree and were back here and we dont 
know that those agreements are going to hold up said rep gary 
ackerman dny there are not enough trucks in that whole 
country there arent enough trucks in the neighboring countries 
there arent enough planes there is enough food 
members of the delegation said the goal is to deliver 170000 
metric tons of food before the rainy season begins in midmay and 
makes the roads impassable 
rep mickey leland a houston democrat and chairman of the 
committee said the delegation is also concerned that more 
nations the usual members of the donor community have not come 
forth to aide the sudanese people through the united nations 
rep bill emerson rmo pointed to japan and western europe 
for not being as forthcoming as the united states 
i am puzzled as to why the countries of western europe and 
japan have also not gotten on board emerson told a news 
conference wednesday 
ackerman said he was embarrassed that the other nations we 
share this planet with our allies our competitors our friends 
who certainly have a great deal of largesse have not been as 
forthcoming as we have 
shingo yamagami press officer for the japanese embassy said 
its not true that were not doing anything about it 
yamagami cited decisions to provide relief totaling 108 
million on march 28 followed by another 308 million announced 
tuesday last year japan provided 385 million in food to sudan 
and gave 777 million in economic assistance in 1987 
ella krucoff a spokeswoman for the european community also 
disputed the congressmens charges saying theres no question 
the community has given all kinds of aid including emergency aid 
the ec on wednesday announced an action program of 132 
million to cover food and relief needs from april through december 
over the last 15 months the ec gave more than 47 million in aid 
to southern sudan while individual countries gave another 30 
millionplus last year krukoff said 
the united states has pledged 30 million in aid in addition to 
70 million it has already spent this year while also arranging 
for an additional 10 million in a food swap leland said 
ackerman also attacked the united nations relief efforts in 
sudan the un has selected unicef to act as the lead agency to 
coordinate food and logistics 
the united nations has been asleep at the switch in 
sudan ackerman said their operation there is basically 
smoke and mirrors theyre interested in the facade rather than 
the facts their operations which are great in other places are 
sorely lacking there where its as much show businesses as 
anything else 
maie ayoub information officer for emergencies at unicef 
called operation lifeline sudan a huge challenge but she said 
the united nations had successfully negotiated for safe passage of 
more than 100000 metric tons of food through eight corridors of 
tranquility in war zones 
leland said as many as 25 million sudanese are at risk those 
in southern sudan displaced southern sudanese now living in the 
north and as many as 400000 refugees living in neighboring 
ethiopia

if you are among the millions of taxpayers 
delaying the inevitable the internal revenue service is offering a 
little extra help to get you through the final weekend of the tax 
filing season 
the agency is making many of its employees available extra hours 
on saturday and monday the filing deadline to answer calls on 
its tollfree telephone lines the lines will be open five hours on 
saturday and an extra two hours until 7 pm on monday 
in addition irs offices nationwide that offer assistance to 
taxpayers who walk in will not close monday night until the last 
customer has been served 
the irs is expecting more than 25 million returns out of the 
109 million due this year to be filed during the 16 days ending 
monday night and the agency is cautioning procrastinators against 
careless errors 
being careful now can help you avoid common mistakes made in a 
lastminute rush which could delay processing your return or hold 
up your refund the agency said wednesday 
such careless mistakes have shown up on hundreds of thousands of 
returns already this year the most common failing to sign the 
return nonitemizers neglecting to claim a standard deduction 
students failing to state whether they can be claimed as a 
dependent by a parent writing down the wrong tax liability from 
the tax tables and basic mathematical mistakes 
in some cases such as errors in math irs computers catch the 
mistakes and correct them others such as failing to sign the 
return require an exchange of letters between irs and taxpayer 
before the return can be processed and a refund mailed 
the irs anticipates that about 6 million couples and individuals 
will avoid the lastminute rush by taking an automatic fourmonth 
extension of the filing deadline that option is available by 
filing a form 4868 
however that only delays filing not paying any tax due the 
form must be accompanied by a check for the estimated tax due 
through friday the irs had received almost 647 million 
returns that is 03 percent above the 645 million received during 
the same period a year ago 
almost 533 million returns have been processed this year up 
almost 1 percent the inventory of unprocessed returns is 114 
million compared with 117 million last year many in that 
inventory are those that do not qualify for a refund the irs 
processes refund returns first to avoid paying interest on late 
refunds 
so far this season the irs has certified 421 million refunds 
up 18 percent from almost 414 million at this time in 1988 this 
years refunds have totaled 347 billion compared with 343 
billion last year the average refund is 824 down from 830 last 
year 
in addition to offering extra hours for telephone assistance 
this weekend the irs said programs that use volunteers to help the 
elderly and others fill out returns will stay open late locations 
of the volunteer income tax assistance and tax counseling for the 
elderly projects are available by calling the irs tollfree 
telephone number 
those numbers are listed in the instructions that accompany 
individual tax forms as are separate numbers for the teletax 
system 
the teletax number also is the one to call for information on a 
refund if you filed a return at least eight weeks ago and have not 
yet received a refund

computers purchased by the national guard 
under a 1986 contract remain useless because they lack the 
necessary software and probably wont be in full working order 
until 1991 a house subcommittee was told 
the army national guard bureau bought 119 unisys 5000 
minicomputers about 5000 terminals and hundreds of printers and 
other equipment but failed to obtain the programs data and other 
routines investigators told the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on oversight and investigations 
the bureau opted for the unisys system believing that their 
burroughs 1900s system would be obsolete by 1986 but guard units 
in 54 states and territories are still using the burroughs 1900s 
lt gen herbert r temple jr chief of the national guard 
bureau and maj gen donald burdick director of the army national 
guard estimated wednesday that the first software package should 
be ready by april 1990 and the unisys system should be operating by 
1991 
validation of software systems is currently under way 
temple and burdick said in a joint statement it is our intention 
to fully utilize this equipment 
meanwhile the computers remain idle with the staff occasionally 
opening boxes to see if they still run or using them for games 
like ticktacktoe said richard chervenak a subcommittee 
investigator who visited eight states that purchased the computers 
in military terms this would be analogous to buying missiles 
without guidance systems troop carriers that do not protect troops 
and attack helicopters without engines said rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the house subcommittee 
staff investigators from the subcommittee who have been looking 
since july 1988 into allegations of irregularities testified that 
some states have threatened to develop their own software for the 
unisys computers the bureaus information management agency warned 
against that step expressing concerns about possible 
incompatibilty of the locally developed software and the software 
being developed for the system 
computer experts in the army have told us that it is 
unthinkable to purchase computer hardware without knowing that the 
software in available chervenak said they stated that the 
federal government purchases computers and software routinely and 
could not understand how the bureau could make such a fundamental 
mistake 
dingell said the investigation found no irregularities by unisys 
but numerous problems with the bureaus handling of the 
procurement including misuse of an expedited contract and probable 
violations of procurement regulations 
according to estimates the guard will spend between 30 million 
and 40 million to replace its computer system dingell said 
dingell said that guard and state officials told subcommittee 
staff that fred trent a civilian employee of the bureau was 
largely to blame for the procurement irregularities but trent died 
in 1986 more than a year before the guard purchased the computers 
in addition to being reprehensible blaming the dead for ones 
own mistakes fits an all too familiar pentagon pattern dingell 
said for example blaming the pilots shot down in the raid on 
libya for bombing the french embassy there

after being courted by president bush in last 
falls campaign groups representing disabled americans are angry 
at the administrations appeal of a court ruling requiring 
wheelchair lifts on new buses 
the accusations that bush broke campaign promises are prompted 
by the administrations request this week that an appellate court 
review its feb 13 ruling that mandated installation of wheelchair 
lifts on new buses bought with federal money 
most of us feel as if he has sold us out that we were used 
said marca bristo president of the chicagobased national council 
on independent living this was an opportunity for him to take a 
clear and decisive leadership role on probably the most passionate 
issue that faces the disabled community public transportation 
advocacy groups for the disabled say the legal maneuver doesnt 
square with bushs campaign rhetoric and his state of the union 
pronouncement that handicapped people belong in the economic 
mainstream 
we need your talents in americas workforce disabled 
americans must become full partners in americas opportunity 
society bush said during his address to congress on feb 9 
disabled rights lobbyists say bush won many votes by endorsing 
legislation last fall that would do exactly what the court decision 
mandates require that wheelchair lifts be installed in buses 
purchased by local transit companies with federal funds 
the request for a rehearing of the ruling by the full 3rd us 
circuit court of appeals in philadelphia was filed monday despite 
pleas to transportation secretary samuel skinner and white house 
counsel boyden gray by the disabledrights groups at meetings last 
week 
gray was described as sympathetic and skinner promised on friday 
to review the appeal which was originally planned to be filed that 
day bristo said 
skinner told the group that he was not concerned about the cost 
of installing wheelchair lifts as much as court interference with 
his agencys discretion in promulgating regulations 
the petition for rehearing also was submitted despite 
recommendations by three federal agencies the national council on 
the handicapped the presidents committee on employment of people 
with disabilities and the us architectural and transportation 
barriers compliance board 
in a feb 27 letter to bush the chairman of the employment 
advisory committee harold russell told the president that the 
court ruling would be entirely consistent with his stated goal 
of helping disabled americans get more job opportunities 
tim cook an attorney with the national disability action 
center which is representing the plaintiffs in the bus lawsuit 
said that for the administration to now renege on that promise 
and seek to overturn this case is not being well accepted by the 
disability community 
the 3rd circuit set aside regulations that allowed local transit 
to demand 24hour notice from the handicapped that special services 
would be needed it also struck down a provision of the regulation 
that said transit authorities would be considered in compliance 
with disability rights policy if they spent 3 percent of their 
operating expenses on improving access for the handicapped 
the decision was seen by disabled people as a landmark ruling in 
their quest for access to public transportation cook said 
the major reason that people with disabilities are unemployed 
is the lack of lack of decent public transportation cook said 
if you cant get to the job or the training you are going to sit 
at home 
spokesmen for the white house and the transportation department 
did not return telephone calls on the subject wednesday 
the administrations legal brief filed by the justice department 
contended that the 3rd circuit decision would cost local transit 
authorities 270 million a year to provide wheelchair lifts on 
buses 
the justice department contends that federal laws do not 
require this wholesale restructuring of mass transit services or 
the imposition of the attendant financial burdens on an already 
overburdened public transportation system 
it also said such policy decisions should be left to the 
transportation department not made by the courts

lawmakers facing the loss of military bases in 
their home states claim a federal commissions list of 
installations recommended for closure should be rejected because it 
is based on erroneous information 
the commissions report and recommendations are flawed rep 
ed madigan rill said wednesday during consideration of a house 
resolution to disapprove the suggestions of the commission on base 
realignment and closure 
the panel recommended last december closing 86 bases partly 
closing five others and changing the mission of 54 other 
installations at an estimated savings of 694 million a year with 
20year savings estimated at 56 billion 
former defense secretary frank c carlucci approved the 
recommendations and the house armed services committee voted 434 
to support the commissions decision 
the full house which is scheduled to vote on the resolution 
next tuesday is expected to follow the committees action 
according to law the commissions recommendations must be accepted 
in their entirety and if the resolution of disapproval fails the 
plan will go into effect next month base closings will then begin 
in 1990 
i hear the pain of many members whose bases will be closed in 
their districts said rep pat schroeder dcolo as debate got 
under way on the house floor that is the bill the house voted 
for she said referring to the legislation setting up the 
commission 
representatives from new jersey illinois and california as well 
as other states acknowledged that they will likely lose the fight 
but expressed concerns over the commissions methodology and its 
recommendations 
congressmen cited a general accounting office report released 
wednesday that found that the commission may have made its 
recommendations for realignments and closures based on incomplete 
and inaccurate data 
the gao congress investigative arm said the commission used 
erroneous data in its analysis of army training centers including 
fort dix in new jersey the agency also found errors in the data 
and weaknesses in the methodology in the analysis of air force 
technical training bases including chanute air force base in 
illinois 
but frank conahan of the gao said that some of the data used 
by the commission that had been questioned were in fact correct 
i need to emphasize that the issues i have discussed and 
questions i have raised about the commissions work are not 
intended at this point to imply disagreement with the commissions 
overall conclusions conahan said 
rep christopher smith rnj said he found it highly 
disturbing that the gao office in findings released today used 
faulty information 
rep jim courter rnj said most of the savings cited by the 
commission would come from reductions in troop strength in 
addition the commissions decision to close a number of bases 
including fort dix in new jersey was based on incorrect 
information and clerical error he contended 
madigan said no member of the commission or its staff visited 
the chanute air force base in illinois and charged that the panel 
made its decision based on inaccurate information and will not 
achieve the allege cost savings

president bushs choice to be us ambassador 
to west germany says a central point of his job will be pressing 
the bonn government to curb exports of chemical weapons and other 
military technology to the third world 
vernon walters praised by the democratic and republican members 
of the senate foreign relations committee is certain of winning 
confirmation from the full senate said democratic senator joseph 
biden chairman of the subcommittee on european affairs 
one of the things the germans look for is how well we 
respect them by who we send them and its obvious by the choice 
of walters that we respect them a great deal said biden 
i can think of no other relationship that is more important 
today to the united states and to the west than the germanamerican 
tie walters told the panel 
the federal republic of germany stands at the center of 
eastwest relations he said the west german public is the 
main target of soviet general secretary gorbachevs charm 
offensive precisely because the federal republic is so important 
to the alliance 
recent us differences with bonn such as problems over exports 
and modernization of germanbased us nuclear missiles are 
inevitable in such a close relationship he said 
the differences reflect the very importance variety and 
intensity of our ties and our respective interests rather than 
fundamental differences walters said 
sen jesse helms rnc cited west german press reports of a 
range of sales of chemical nuclear and missile technology to 
countries such as iraq and libya 
helms a sponsor of legislation that would impose sanctions on 
german companies involved in the exports said the west german 
government had ignored us diplomatic objections to the exports as 
well as warnings from its own investigative agency 
the united states has made more than 150 diplomatic 
representations to the west german government over the past eight 
years concerning improper exports to libya iran iraq syria 
and south asia helms said 
since all of these areas continue to receive german equipment 
and technology in the face of our diplomatic efforts i guess we 
ought to be sort of ashamed of our diplomatic results he said 
this will be a central problem for me senator said 
walters you have mentioned the unsuccessful representations i 
will do my best to see they are more successful in the future 
the senators from both parties took turns in praising walters 
71 for his long career of government service starting with the 
army in 1941 he rose to the rank of lieutenant general and served 
directly under presidents starting with harry truman he was an 
interpreter for president dwight eisenhower on his foreign trips 
during the 1950s 
biden said he would be the first us ambassador in two decades 
to go to bonn being able to speak german a linguist walters also 
speaks french spanish portuguese italian dutch and russian 
his diplomatic posts have included being a military attache in 
italy brazil and france and he was involved in negotiations with 
the north vietnamese and chinese in paris from 1969 to 1972 
he has been us ambassador to the united nations since 1985

investigative files and other documents being 
sought by impeached federal judge alcee l hastings from a 
congressional panel contain nothing that will help him remain on 
the bench a key lawmaker says 
he knows very well that we have no documents that exonerate 
the defendant rep john bryant dtexas said wednesday if we 
did why on earth would we be here we have had no desire to spend 
the last three years working on this matter 
hastings 52 is accused of plotting to get a bribe in 1981 and 
lying about it two years later before a jury that eventually 
acquitted him 
impeachment articles that the house approved 4133 on aug 3 
also accuse him in an unrelated matter of improperly divulging 
secret wiretap information 
the senate must now decide whether to remove him from the bench 
and stop payment of his 89500 salary 
bryant told a 12member senate committee reviewing evidence 
against hastings that it should reject a defense plea for documents 
and a 180day delay to allow for questioning a lengthy list of 
potential witnesses including us chief justice william rehnquist 
bryant said the house committee that prepared the impeachment 
articles has already given the defense many documents and offered 
access to others he said it was unreasonable to demand every 
single document we ever reviewed 
rep george w gekas rpa also urged the senators to head off 
questioning of such potential witnesses as rehnquist we find 
that all of this evidence that none of it is relevant to the facts 
that must be presented to this committee gekas said 
defense attorneys are trying to get governmentpaid expenses 
totaling 200000 plus fees that could add up to as much as 
750000 house prosecutors have taken no position on that request 
hastings attorney terence j anderson said that as a law 
professor he could afford to take the summer off to work on the 
impeachment case but he said that without government funding 
cocounsel patricia williams would be committing economic 
suicide to stay with the case to the neglect of her law practice 
the panels chairman sen jeff bingaman dnm told reporters 
it would probably announce its decision on the requests later this 
week but anderson said the mood of the senators appeared less than 
encouraging 
i felt an awful lot like the train is continuing to run down 
the track he said after the session 
sen arlen specter rpa expressed misgivings about the 
request for taxpayers funds to finance the legal battle 
youre making an unprecedented request for compensation which 
just speaking for myself i dont think youre going to have 
available he said 
according to the defense hastings knew nothing of any plot 
washington attorney william borders a friend and onetime 
classmate of hastings was convicted of conspiring to shake down 
two defendants sentenced to prison by hastings the idea was that a 
150000 payment would get the punishment changed to probation 
arrested after accepting a cashstuffed garment bag from an 
undercover agent borders eventually was sent to prison 
throughout the affair however borders was merely blowing 
smoke according to anderson he says hastings was simply not 
involved

dan quayle earned over 50000 in speaking 
fees as a member of the senate last year before he accepted the 
republican vice presidential nomination 
in so doing quayle got roughly 17000 more than senators are 
allowed to accept in speaking honoraria but he gave the excess 
fees to charity and deducted the contributions on his 1988 tax 
form thus complying with the honoraria limit 
this transaction was made public wednesday as quayles office 
released his tax returns simultaneously with the white houses 
release of president bushs tax forms 
bush earned 155662 last year from business holdings kept in a 
blind trust well above the 115000 salary he drew from the 
government as vice president he and his wife barbara reported an 
adjusted gross income of 287171 
that was based on bushs 155662 in interestanddividend 
earnings through partnerships and other interests masked by the 
blind trust plus his government salary also included was 7147 
in other interest along with 12362 in income from other sources 
primarily profits that bush made from his partnership in a firm 
that leased a liquefied natural gas transportation barge in 
louisiana 
when his 1988 federal tax liability of 62106 was deducted from 
the 94884 total in money withheld or prepaid bush had overpaid 
by 32778 white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said he 
applied 15000 to next years tax liability and kept the remaining 
17778 
estimates on bushs net worth have varied substantially 
although records show that the president who made the bulk of his 
money as an oil entrepreneur in texas has assets worth well over 
2 million 
fitzwater said he thought that reports of bushs wealth are 
vastly overestimated most of his net worth is in the kennebunkport 
maine estate 
the quayles who records show hold assets worth more than 14 
million reported an adjusted gross income of 156546 last year 
the bulk of that coming from quayles 89500 senate salary 
quayle listed charitable contributions totaling 17304 or just 
a little more than the 16997 in speaking fees that he could not 
keep for himself 
the vice presidents press secretary dave beckwith said quayle 
had written off the excess speakers fees in an appropriate fashion 
he earned more in honoraria than hes allowed to keep so he 
gave all the excess to charity beckwith said 
the spokesman said quayle gained no tax advantage by writing off 
the extra speaking fees as charitable contributions saying you 
have approximately 17000 more in income and 17000 more in 
deductions so its a wash 
quayle earned all his speaking fees before august when the 
republican party nominated him to be bushs vice presidential 
running mate 
the balance of his 156546 income came from interest dividends 
and capital gains relating to his familys central newspapers inc 
quayle also made 2000 as a director of central newspapers a 
position he would have to relinquish under ethics legislation that 
bush proposed to congress thursday

the author of the senatepassed bill to raise 
the minimum wage says president bush runs a high political risk 
with voters by vetoing the measure while republicans say the 
president must prove his ability to stand firm 
i hope we still can reach agreement with the president sen 
edward m kennedy said wednesday night after his proposal to raise 
the hourly minimum wage from 335 to 455 by october 1991 cleared 
the senate on a 6237 vote 
if thats not the case well see the president and those who 
support the presidents position at the polls said kennedy 
dmass 
there are some differences between the kennedy bill and 
legislation already passed by the house a conference committee was 
expected to be named today to draft a compromise 
kennedy without being specific said he was open to compromise 
with the white house during the conference stage but the prospects 
for such an overture from bush appear highly unlikely bush 
repeatedly has said his proposal to raise the minimum wage to 425 
by january 1992 rejected in both the house and the senate was his 
last 
i have it on pretty good authority that its not going to be 
higher than 425 said senate minority leader robert dole 
husband of labor secretary elizabeth dole 
the final bill could be considered as early as next week 
although no timetable has been set the democratic leadership has 
the votes to win final passage but bush appears to have more than 
enough votes to sustain a veto 
ten republicans joined 52 democrats in supporting the senate 
bill while two democrats and 35 republicans voted against it the 
only senator not voting was albert gore jr dtenn 
a renewed campaign to get the president to change his mind began 
just after the vote 
i urge the president to sign it when it reaches his desk 
aflcio president lane kirkland said in a statement a veto would 
only compound the inequities faced by americas lowestpaid workers 
who have gone eight years without a pay raise 
but republicans noting a number of other democratsponsored 
domestic programs likely to emerge from congress over gop 
objections said it was time for bush to prove he will stand his 
ground 
everyone knows the whole ballgame rests on the presidential 
veto said sen orrin hatch rutah he said few presidents have 
had to control congress through repeated vetoes but added i 
suspect this president is going to have to do that 
under the democrats plan the minimum wage frozen at 335 
since 1981 would rise to 385 on oct1 to 425 on oct 1 1990 
and to 455 a year later 
bush has said he would veto any bill to raise the minimum wage 
to more than 425 an hour and has insisted legislation must also 
allow employers to pay all new workers a subminimum wage for up to 
six months 
republicans argue the training wage is necessary to prevent 
massive job losses they contend would be caused by the higher 
minimum wage democrats have disputed the jobloss predictions but 
included in their measures a provision allowing employers to pay 
some new workers a lower scale for up to two months

an estimated 25 million people in north and south 
america already are infected with the aids virus and some parts of 
the hemisphere may be facing a massive epidemic doctors warned 
today 
the researchers said the aids epidemic in some latin and 
caribbean nations may become as bad as the outbreak in africa 
although the severity will vary from country to country 
their concern expressed in an editorial in todays new england 
journal of medicine is based in part on the apparent spread of the 
disease from homosexuals to heterosexuals this shift will put far 
more people at risk of the deadly disease 
the world health organization estimates that at least 5 million 
people worldwide are infected with the virus and 350000 have 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
in march 1987 a who report said 50 million to 100 million 
people may be infected by 1991 but in december it reduced that to 
6 million to 7 million because of evidence of behavioral changes 
among high risk groups 
citing the best available data and with use of mathematical 
models that incorporate the prolonged incubation period of aids 
the editorial predicted that 500000 people in the western 
hemisphere are likely to be diagnosed with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome by 1992 
we have great concern that we are starting to see a more 
heterosexual pattern of spread emerging in these countries said 
dr thomas c quinn an aids expert at the national institute of 
allergy and infectious diseases who wrote the editorial with two 
physicians from the pan american health organization 
once it becomes an established heterosexual epidemic in those 
countries it has a potential for rapidly increasing in sheer 
numbers like in africa 
a separate study in the journal which described the level of 
aids infection in brazil agreed with quinns concern 
we are very fearful of the same situation said the senior 
author of that study dr david d ho of cedarssinai medical 
center in los angeles 
in their editorial the doctors warned if hiv1 infection 
continues to penetrate the poor and less advantaged populations of 
latin america and the caribbean there is the potential for a 
massive epidemic in the americas that may parallel the situation in 
africa where many cases remain unrecognized and unreported 
in africa the disease is spread primarily by heterosexual 
intercourse and affects men and women in almost equal numbers in 
the united states victims are largely male homosexuals and drug 
abusers and men outnumber women about 10 to 1 
quinn noted that the epidemic in most latin and caribbean 
countries is far behind africas but there are troubling signs it 
will follow a similar course 
among these are the relatively high proportion of women victims 
in some countries the male to female ratio in french guiana is 15 
to 1 hondurus 17 to 1 bahamas 18 to 1 and trinidad 4 to 1 
quinn said poverty levels and a high frequency of prostitution 
in some of the countries also may contribute to the transmission of 
aids as a heterosexual disease 
he noted that the disease is already well established in some 
countries in haiti 10 percent of pregnant women are infected the 
same as in some parts of africa there are 379 aids cases per 
million people in the bahamas and 350 per million in bermuda 
compared with 71 per million in the united states 
however the epidemic will vary from country to country he 
predicted that in chile bolivia and argentina among other 
countries the spread to heterosexuals will probably be slow as it 
as been in the united states 
quinn said the relatively large numbers of bisexual men in some 
latin countries appears to be hastening the spread of the disease 
from homosexuals to heterosexuals one of these is brazil where 
hos study found that 28 percent of bisexual men and 23 percent of 
homosexual men were infected with the aids virus 
the study found that 9 percent of lowerclass female street 
walkers in rio de janeiro were infected but none of middleclass 
or upperclass prostitutes tested were 
the researchers also found five people who were infected with 
hiv2 an apparently less virulent relative of the primary aids 
virus that until now has been confined largely to west africa 
the second aids virus is spreading to this part of the world 
slowly but surely ho said

federal officials expressed amazement that 
us industry released 225 billion pounds of toxic materials into 
the air water and ground in a single year but they cautioned 
against jumping to conclusions about the health effects 
the environmental protection agency released the toxic pollution 
figures wednesday after they had been submitted to the agency by 
chemical companies mining companies and other industries under a 
new public disclosure law 
the epa acknowledged that not all the companies reported 
discharges despite the threat of fines and the law did not cover 
smaller businesses such as gasoline service stations 
the numbers are startling unacceptably high and far beyond 
what we thought was occurring linda fischer assistant epa 
administrator for policy and planning told reporters 
at the same news conference sen frank lautenberg dnj said 
the numbers are staggering and provide clear evidence that 
stronger emission controls are needed for industry 
but epa officials emphasized that the statistics represented 
only raw numbers that have yet to be analyzed and some expressed 
uneasiness with releasing them altogether without further 
interpretation 
epa administrator william reilly said in a statement that while 
the raw figures indicate tighter pollution standards are needed in 
some case they do not prove in themselves that a public health 
problem exists 
release does not equal exposure said reilly noting that 
the raw figures do not take into account rates of release 
concentrations or actual exposure to humans 
it is likely that only a few facilities are exposing the 
public to toxic chemicals at a rate that could require immediate 
action reilly said 
nevertheless the sheer volume of toxic substances representing 
more than 300 chemicals including an assortment known to cause 
cancer and other serious illnesses took government officials by 
surprise 
the pollutants released during 1987 broke down this way 97 
billion pounds of chemicals into streams and other bodies of water 
27 billion pounds into the air 24 billion pounds into landfills 
32 billion pounds injected deep into the ground for disposal 19 
billion pounds shipped to municipal waste water treatment plants 
and 26 billion pounds sent to offsite treatment and disposal 
facilities 
although discharges into water accounted for by far the largest 
volume of releases epa officials said 95 percent of those were of 
sodium sulfate a chemical the epa already has determined does not 
pose significant health risks or environmental harm and is expected 
to be taken off the toxics list later this year 
the remaining pollutants into water chiefly consist of chemicals 
that are already regulated by epa and states the agency said 
only a small number of the toxic pollutants discharged into the 
air are regulated by the epa at this time however such releases 
of chemicals including many that are carcinogenic are still too 
high and require changes in federal clean air laws said reilly 
the largest volume of pollutants released into land come from 
mining said the epa which is developing tighter discharge 
controls for mining wastes 
texas had the most overall pollutants ranking first among the 
states in air and land releases and either second or third in the 
other categories louisiana also ranked among the top five states 
in all categories while california had the highest volume of 
releases into water 
while the total pounds of chemical releases were high they did 
not reflect all pollutants being discharged the reporting 
requirements cover only larger companies and not for example 
gasoline stations dry cleaners or other small likely polluters 
and as many as onefourth of the companies required to report 
discharges failed to do so despite the threat of a fine officials 
said

the jumbo jet had been in the air for only 16 
minutes when mayday came crackling over the radio from united 
flight 811 high over the pacific weve gotta come back we 
had a bomb or something go off in the airplane trying to get 
back to the airport 
so began 25 of the most harrowing minutes in the life of capt 
david cronin his copilot al salder and more than 300 other crew 
and passengers aboard the united airlines jetliner last feb 24 
there was no bomb although the pilots were all but certain one 
had exploded but a 10foot hole had ripped open on the side of the 
aircraft cabin sweeping nine passengers to their deaths at 22000 
feet 
a glimpse of the drama was provided wednesday when the federal 
aviation administration released tapes of radio communications 
between flight 811 and air traffic controllers in honolulu 
for the most part salder was believed to be at the microphone 
with cronin fighting to keep the hugh boeing 747 jetliner aloft 
although faa officials said it was unclear who was speaking during 
certain exchanges 
what was clear however is that more than once the pilots as 
well as controllers monitoring and directing them feared the jet 
would plunge into the pacific the pilots repeatedly sought to be 
assured they were being tracked by radar so a rapid water rescue 
mission could be launched if necessary 
the jet bound for auckland new zealand with 354 people aboard 
was awaiting clearance to climb to a normal 30000 feet cruising 
altitude and was only 16 minutes out of honolulu when the tragedy 
struck 
were at ah mayday weve gotta come back we had a bomb or 
something go off in the airplane ah were making a oneeighty 
trying to get back to the airport came the first emergency call 
from the cockpit 
seconds later the crew provided the first indication of the 
seriousness of the problem 
we dont know whats going on ah looks like weve lost no 3 
engine and were descending rapidly ah coming back the pilot 
reported 
it would be another 25 minutes before the jumbo jet would be 
resting in the middle of runway 8 left at the honolulu airport and 
the pilot reporting united eight eleven heavy were evacuating 
the airplane 
about six minutes after the incident began cronin apparently 
had begun getting better control of the aircraft after descending 
to 9000 feet 
it appears that weve ah we have lost no 3 engine and weve 
lost were not getting full power out of no 4 were ah not 
able to hold an altitude right now were dumping fuel so i think 
were gonna be able to hold an altitude shortly the pilots 
reported as the crippled plane continue its limp to land with 60 
miles still to go 
the pilots remained convinced a bomb had gone off 
it looks like we got a bomb ah that went off on the right 
side ah the whole right side is gone the copilot told 
controllers as the jet was at 4000 feet and descending there now 
was a fire in one engine and 45 miles still to go before any 
opportunity to land 
so ah you watch us the pilot pleaded to controllers 
united 811 i have you on radar the controller assured the 
crew 
as the boeing 747 flew closer to land air traffic control began 
to provide directions to line the jet up for an approach but the 
pilots still could not see the airport and that worried them 
we should have the airport but we dont came the voice 
from the cockpit 
in the honolulu tower controllers were not sure the plane would 
make it 
a controller directed the honolulu rescue center to hold a 
helicopter on the ground for the time being but prepared to fly 
if you see flight 811 go down in the water or on land or 
something then you can sent a helicopter right out there the 
unnamed controller advised the rescue center breaking for a moment 
away from directing flight 811 in for a landing 
ok weve got the island in sight but we dont show the 
airport said the pilot as the struggling jet flew within 11 
miles of the airport just under 4000 feet in the air 
the runway lights were turned up to full power and the 
controller assured the pilots his radar showed them with enough 
altitude to clear land 
ok we have the airport now finally came word from the jet 
less than two minutes later the jumbo jet with the massive hole 
on its side touched ground

sovietborn conductor mstislav rostropovich 
says he is very excited and very nervous about leading a 
concert tour of the national symphony orchestra in his homeland 
after 15 years in exile 
rostropovich 62 a renowned cello virtuoso who has been music 
director of the national symphony since 1977 wept at a kennedy 
center news conference wednesday as he announced plans for two 
concerts in moscow and two in leningrad next february 
this is the very very exciting moment in my entire life 
said rostropovich who fled the soviet union in 1974 with his wife 
soprano galina vishnevskaya after growing harassment and 
curtailment of their concert appearances by soviet authorities 
rostropovich has not returned to the soviet union since except 
for a brief unnoticed stopover at the moscow airport a few years 
ago he maintains apartments in washington and paris and travels 
on a swiss passport 
the couple were stripped of their soviet citizenship in 1978 for 
acts harmful to the prestige of the ussr their troubles 
began when they befriended soviet author alexander solzhenitsyn a 
human rights champion who also sought exile in the west 
soviet ambassador yuri dubinin hinted broadly that if 
rostropovich gave the signal soviet authorities would be willing 
to begin the legal process toward restoring his citizenship 
dubinin tears streaming down his face embraced rostropovich after 
the news conference 
but rostropovich sidestepped questions about his future plans 
stephen klein executive director of the national symphony told 
reporters it was highly unlikely that rostropovich would seek to 
regain his citizenship and return permanently to the soviet union 
in an emotional speech at an orchestra rehearsal wednesday 
morning klein said rostropovich noted that many of his soviet 
contemporaries including composers dmitri shostakovich and aram 
katchaturian violinist david oistrakh and pianist emil gilels 
had died since he left the soviet union 
you have become my family the conductor told his musicians 
rumors of an impending soviet tour had circulated for months 
but the orchestras 103 members had no confirmation until 
rostropovich broke the news wednesday morning 
violinist lev pekarsky formerly with the moscow state symphony 
orchestra said his wife had received a letter from an aunt in 
moscow last week who wrote that a national symphony tour was 
disclosed in a brief article in a soviet newspaper 
klein said he received formal word of the invitation from 
gosconcert the soviet performing arts agency only on monday 
rostropovich praised soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reform policies and said soviet artists are free to perform 
anywhere in the west without restrictions 
the soviet people have so much more freedom so much more 
glasnost than before mr gorbachev rostropovich said for 
artistic freedom there has been enormous change 
dubinin said the tour will be a very very important page for 
his biography for development of cultural exchanges and for 
deep changes in our society and our relations with the united 
states 
rostropovich said his wife a former bolshoi opera star will 
accompany him on the orchestra tour which will begin in late 
january with two weeks of concerts in japan orchestra officials 
said however that she probably will not sing during the tour

the house has authorized the state department 
and other government international agencies to spend 46 billion 
next fiscal year 257 million less than president bush wanted 
the house by a 33887 vote approved the measure wednesday 
authorizing a wide range of expenditures with cuts in many areas of 
the administrations proposal 
however the amount is still 512 million more than fiscal 1989 
primarily because of 
restoration of us contributions to the united nations that 
were withheld in 1985 as a way to pressure the un for budget 
reforms 
the expense of new un peacekeeping efforts in the persian 
gulf namibia and angola 
construction of a new radio transmitter in israel to improve 
us broadcasting to the soviet union and 
television marti a new broadcast service to cuba 
as an authorization bill the measure does not directly result 
in spending in many cases congress does not appropriate the full 
amounts authorized 
the house voted 25 million for the national endowment for 
democracy an organization that awards grants to private 
organizations to promote democracy and pluralism that is 92 
million more than bush requested 
an amendment offered by rep paul kanjorski dpa would have 
brought the amount down to the 158 million sought by the 
administration but failed on a 216209 vote 
the bill authorizes 412 million for migration and refugee 
assistance 32 million more than bush wanted the foreign affairs 
committee said it raised the amount because of a recent increase in 
refugees particularly from the soviet union and southeast asia 
the bill also authorizes 100 million in additional funds for 
fiscal 1989 to assist soviet citizens moving to the united states 
and for african and southeast asian refugees 
the house approved an amendment to the measure that would 
withhold the us contribution to un peacekeeping activity in 
angola unless all cuban troops are withdrawn from that country 
according to the stipulations of the tripartite agreement 
the bill also authorizes 496 billion for 1991 for the state 
department and related agencies 
those agencies are the us information agency the board for 
international broadcasting the interamerican foundation and the 
asia foundation

exxon corp has yet to open its checkbook 
despite promises by the giant energy company to atone for the 
massive oil spill off alaskas coast interior secretary manuel 
lujan says 
lujan called in reporters wednesday to complain about the lack 
of progress in 10 days of negotiations aimed at getting exxon to 
pay 15 million in up front money to help assess the 
environmental damage caused by the oil spill and plan for a 
recovery 
asked whether he thought exxon had lived up to its repeated 
promises to do everything possible to rectify damages caused by the 
exxon valdez tanker spill in prince william sound lujan replied 
they have not yet because they havent given us the 15 million 
for the longterm assessment 
lujan said exxon lawyers are negotiating hard and trying 
to get any advantage that they can 
les rogers spokesman for exxon co usa in houston said the 
company was surprised and baffled about lujans complaints 
there has never been any question that exxon is willing to 
appropriately fund the study said rogers reading from a 
prepared statement exxon offered to advance funds that may be 
needed while discussions were ongoing 
rogers said the negotiations which involved three other 
agencies in addition to interior were scheduled to continue 
steve goldstein the secretarys chief spokesman said that 
lujan is concerned that the reluctance by exxon to open its 
checkbook as reflected by these negotiations will in many ways 
dictate the approach that is going to be taken by exxon in the 
future 
he lujan thought exxon was going to come to the 
negotiations with a check in their back pocket said goldstein 
government lawyers told exxon attorneys they wanted 15 million 
in advance for developing a longterm recovery plan and assessing 
the extent of damage to wildlife waterfowl and fish and public 
lands eventually these costs separate from the direct cleanup 
costs are likely to be in the tens of millions of dollars 
said lujan 
lujan said the government wants to distribute 8 million 
immediately to officials representing a number of government 
agencies already working in alaska and put the other 7 million in 
reserve he said one reason exxon has balked is that the company 
complained the money would not be earning interest if it is turned 
over to the government in a lump sum

rep tony coelho bought a 100000 junk bond 
three years ago through drexel burnham lambert inc and company 
records said the purchase was made by the democratic leaders 
campaign committee a published report says 
during the same time he held the bonds the california 
congressman was chairman of the house democratic congressional 
campaign committee the washington post reported in todays 
editions 
the committee has received some of its largest donations from 
drexels political action committee and from indicted junk bond 
pioneer michael milken the post said 
coelho also received speaking honoraria from drexel in 1986 and 
1987 the post said and coelho had worked to prevent the closing 
of drexels beverly hills office as part of an expected settlement 
of a long civil fraud investigation of milken and drexel according 
to a los angeles times story cited by the post 
but coelho told the post that at the time of the investment he 
didnt know drexel was connected with the highrisk highyield 
bond he said it was recommended by a friend he declined to 
identify 
the issue was used to help finance the takeover of beatrice 
foods by bci holdings 
my decision to purchase the bond had nothing to do with 
drexel milken or an employee of drexel coelho said 
coelho the thirdranking democrat in the house said in the 
letter he assumed the drexel records listing his campaign as the 
purchaser were the result of a computer error and he bought the 
bonds with his own money 
house rules forbid members to convert campaign funds for 
personal uses 
drexels list coelho for congress as the initial purchaser 
of the funds on april 10 1986 the post said the post said the 
purchase was generally available only to institutional investors 
and regular customers of the wall street investment firm 
according to coelhos letter the purchase was corrected and 
his accountant sent coelhos personal payment to drexel three weeks 
after the initial order date the post said 
coelho the house majority whip earned about 12000 in 
interest and profits during the six months he held the bonds 
according to his disclosure statement the post said

a wellknown soviet screenwriter and former 
policeman says he unearthed the remains of murdered czar nicholas 
ii and the czars family a decade ago and wants to give them a 
proper burial the moscow news reported 
geli ryabov told the newspaper he was convinced he had found the 
remains of the last of the romanovs in a pit in sverdlosk in the 
ural mountains by the number of corpses the type of wounds and 
dental prostheses he found 
the bodies had been hidden to keep the burial place from 
becoming a shrine for monarchist pilgrimages ryabov said 
moscow news published his account in its latest edition 
wednesday along with a photo of a blackened skull the paper said 
ryabov identified as being that of nicholas ii 
the conviction ripened in me that i must find out and tell 
people the truth about the execution and burial of the romanovs 
ryabov told the newspaper 
in july 1918 soldiers acting on bolshevik orders took nicholas 
and 10 others including a 14yearold boy and six women into a 
basement in a sverdlosk house and shot them nicholas born in 
1868 was forced to abdicate in march 1917 as revolution swept 
russia 
the communists seized power in november 1917 
until now moscow news said investigators assumed they could 
not find the bodies because the remains were reportedly dropped 
into a mineshaft where they dissolved under a layer of acid 
leaving only meager traces including buttons some jewelry and a 
cutoff human finger 
but ryabov said he embarked upon a personal quest to find the 
true resting place of the murdered family he first went to 
sverdlovsk formerly known as ekaterinburg in 1976 
ryabov said he read everything ever written about the incident 
including investigators reports and even enlisted the aid of the 
children of the commissar who oversaw the shootings yakov 
yurkovsky 
he said his police experience helped lead him to a clue certain 
documents mentioned that the truck carrying the bodies got stuck in 
a swamp at one point 
and i decided to find that place ryabov told the moscow 
news 
ten years ago when we uncovered the burial mound theres no 
other word for the pit into which they had thrown the naked bodies 
to lighten the truck and even after that i just couldnt publish 
the results of my investigation he told the newspaper those 
werent the right times 
in the franker atmosphere fostered by president mikhail s 
gorbachevs campaign for glasnost or greater openness wider room 
has been allowed for discussing both current problems and some 
darker epsiodes of soviet history 
in ryabovs reconstruction of what happened the romanovs faces 
were beaten with riflebutts to prevent identification and acid was 
poured from ceramic jars to dissolve their features 
the house where the shootings took place was destroyed in 1977 
despite its historical significance the newspaper said 
ryabov says he is prepared to submit his find to experts but 
only if permission is received for proper burial for the executed 
befitting people and christians 
ryabov gave only a partial account of his find to the moscow 
news his full story titled were forced to shoot you is 
scheduled to appear in the monthly journal rodina or homeland 
this month

smugglers along the usmexico border 
have long had a macho image and been praised in song but drug 
rings involved in satanic killings are not part of the lore 
our smugglers do not pray to the devil said alma rosa 
garza a local secretary she noted that the alleged leader of a 
voodoo cult of drug smugglers that is blamed for at least 12 ritual 
slayings was cuban 
smuggling along the border involves drugs and illegal immigrants 
going north luxury and consumer goods and even industrial and farm 
machinery comes the other way 
and thousands of americans come to matamoros and nearby reynosa 
every night to drink party or visit whorehouses nearly 22000 
visitors many of them college students come across daily during 
college spring break 
among those visitors was mark kilroy a premed student from the 
university of texas who disappeared during a nighttime trip with 
friends to matamoros 
kilroy was among those killed by smugglers who believed satanic 
ritual would protect them from harm authorities say 
mexican police say five people have been arrested in the case 
and authorities on both sides of the border were seeking the cult 
godfather identified as adolfo de jesus constanzo a cuban 
national in his late 40s 
it was the strangest case involving drugs that i have seen in 
my years as a newsman said edgardo montiel editorial director 
of the matamoros newspaper el bravo 
violence is common in the border he said but not this kind of 
violence 
we are very concerned and we will tell the tourists that 999 
percent of the people here are good and that it only takes one or 
two to give the others a bad name ignacio garcia a shift 
supervisor at pancho villas restaurant said wednesday 
authorities were quick to say that the mass killing should not 
alarm potential tourists 
we do not believe there is any danger to people traveling to 
matamoros said texas attorney general jim mattox 
but this city on the rio grande near the southern tip of texas 
is widely known as a place where drug trafficking money buys 
political power and legitimate businesses 
songs celebrate smugglers courage in gunbattles with the law on 
both sides of the border 
the smugglers form a social group ranging from the guntoting 
river rat who carryies sacks of marijuana and packets of cocaine to 
the bigtime operator who runs tons of drugs and doubles as a 
school benefactor and charitable figure 
in almost every border town from matamoros to tijuana on the 
california border almost 2000 miles to the west their true 
calling seems known to all 
you can point them out matamoros mayor fernando montemayor 
said in an interview but you cant prove anything it is like 
the mafia in the united states 
the case is an alarm crazies like these are the product 
of the drug traffic said the mayor who has closed down 
expensive bars and restaurants where drugs were sold and also shut 
down the red light district 
federal prosecutor jose silva said some killings in the cult 
case appeared to be more revenge murder than cult sacrifice at 
least two victims were former local police who had had some 
connection with the matamoros drug trade according to federal 
police 
to me this is all part of the us influence of total freedom 
and excess we mexicans are more traditionalist more conservative 
rituals and drugs are a thing of the united states said rosa 
garza

dilson domingos funaro the former 
brazilian finance minister who was instrumental in instituting 
brazils debt moratorium in 1987 has died of lymphatic cancer he 
was 55 
funaro died wednesday at osvaldo cruz hospital in sao paulo 
said hospital supervisor vera tavares 
funaro born in sao paulo the nations financial and industrial 
center was named head of the powerful finance ministry in august 
1985 in the midst of brazils worst inflationary crisis 
internationally known for refusing to accept monitoring of the 
brazilian economy by the international monetary fund funaro 
announced the 10month moratorium on the nations foreign debt 
interest payments in february 1987 
we arent here to sacrifice ourselves and our economy to 
maintain citibank profits funaro told journalists shortly before 
announcing the moratorium 
funaro was also a key player in launching the failed 1986 
antiinflation cruzado plan the plan which froze wages and 
prices to combat rampant inflation led to a consumer spending 
spree that created serious shortages and a drop in exports and cash 
reserves 
after the freeze collapsed and inflation soared to an annual 
rate of 500 percent funaros popularity among politicians and 
citizens fell he stepped down from the post in march 1987

critics 
the order by thornburgh on wednesday rescinds an order by 
outgoing attorney general edwin meese iii last summer that had 
required the justice department to appoint independent counsels to 
investigate members of congress 
thornburghs action returns to the justice department at least 
while congress studies the legislation its traditional role in 
investigating allegations of criminal wrongdoing by members of 
congress 
the congress has been asked to review the role of the 
independent counsel thornburgh who had expressed doubts about 
the meese order said in a statement 
the order was issued hours after bush proposed in his ethics 
package to extend to members of congress the law providing for 
court appointment of independent counsels to investigate high

analyst who helped direct a study on electric power trends in the 
united states said wednesday 
although electricity supplies for the peak use periods of summer 
are tightest in new england the power outlook for the nation as a 
whole is growing more uncertain said daniel yergin president of 
cambridge energy research associates and a partner in the study 
the central problem is that us electricity demand has grown 
more rapidly than expected since 1985 while utilities have chosen 
not to add to their generating capacity kujawa and yergin told a

physicists popped champagne corks after a 125 million atom 
smasher made its first z particle a milestone in the quest to 
understand whats in the mind of god by studying the birth of 
the universe and the makeup of matter 
im happy with relief and joy said burton richter 1976 
nobel laureate in physics and director of the stanford linear 
accelerator center 30 miles southeast of san francisco 
richter said scientists drank champagne wednesday after 
confirming one z particle was produced tuesday by the 3milelong 
stanford linear collider after an almost twoyear delay 
while z particles are incredibly tiny they are the heaviest 
known fundamental particle of matter weighing the same as 100 
protons the positively charged particles in the center of atoms 
they can be thought of as heavy light because they are a 
heavier version of photons particles that carry light 
discovered by european scientists in 1983 z particles are so 
heavy they could have existed naturally only for an instant after 
the big bang the incomprehensible explosion scientists 
believe formed the universe up to 20 billion years ago 
stanfords collider is designed to massproduce z particles by 
smashing together electrons negatively charged particles that 
make a television picture and their antimatter counterparts 
called positrons mass production of thousands of z particles will 
take months richter cautioned 
the scientists at the european laboratory for particle physics 
cern found the particle by using a collider in which protons are 
smashed against the antimatter counterparts called antiprotons 
since 1983 hundreds of z particles have been produced at 
different kinds of particle smashers at cern and at fermi national 
accelerator laboratory near chicago those machines produced some z 
particles but mostly other products of atomic decay 
the stanford collider and one being built at cerns lab in 
geneva are to produce mostly z particles 
temperatures approach 1 millionbillion degrees at the tiny 
collision point inside stanfords machine coming close to 
recreating conditions that existed in the first onetenth of 
onebillionth of a second after the big bang said california 
institute of technology physicist alan weinstein 
were doing this to try and understand more about the physical 
universe the fundamental building blocks of matter and the forces 
that hold those building blocks together richter said 
the collider will let physicists peer deeper into matter and 
look back at what the universe was like nearer and nearer to its 
beginning he added 
the particle stanford physicist michael riordan said is the 
key to understanding the birth of the universe it helps us 
understand the forces that bind matter together and make it decay 
radioactively 
richter said last year that what were really after is trying 
to understand whats in the mind of god 
the colliders successful creation of its first z particle is a 
triumph for american physicists and for richter thats because the 
machine cost oneeighth as much as the 1 billion large 
electronpositron collider due to produce z particles as soon as 
july at cern 
there was no guarantee z particles would be produced by the 
untested technology of stanfords collider which is shaped like a 
huge tennis racket instead of like cerns conventional ringshaped 
collider 
this is a milestone said jeff sherwood spokesman for the 
us department of energy which paid for the collider were 
delighted to hear the news 
construction of stanfords collider was completed in may 1987 
richter had hoped it would produce z particles that summer 
scientists started it up a year ago shut it down in september to 
correct technical glitches then restarted it in february 
the modifications added 10 million to its original 115 million 
cost riordan said 
weinstein said the collider should help physicists inch toward 
their ultimate goal of developing a theory of everything a 
simple theory that would explain all the particles and four 
fundamental forces of nature many scientists believe the four 
forces are simply different forms of a single force that existed at 
the beginning of time 
the four fundamental forces are gravity electromagnetism which 
produces light radio waves xrays and microwaves the strong 
force which binds protons and neutrons together in the center of 
atoms and the weak force which makes some atoms break down 
radioactively 
the discovery of z and related w particles at another type of 
atom smasher at cern in 1983 yielded the 1984 nobel prize in 
physics for carlo rubbia and simon van der meer because it helped 
verify the standard model that theory says electromagnetism 
and the weak force really are two forms of a single electroweak 
force 
stanfords immediate goal once it massproduces z particles is 
to confirm the standard model by testing predictions about the mass 
of the z particle and existence of particles called higgs bosons 
some scientists also believe the machine may help them discover the 
elusive top quark one of six types of quarks in atoms 
the collider is run by stanford university for the department of 
energy with more than 100 scientists from many universities 
involved

norwegian ship brokers have cooked up a deal 
in which soviet shipyards may build up to 85 new vessels worth 
nearly 26 billion that will be partly paid for in pepsi pizza 
and fried chicken 
olejacob libaek who helped broker the deal said wednesday 
that the us soft drink giant pepsi cola co wants to replace 
vodka as the medium of payment for millions of dollars in products 
it exports annually to the soviet union 
libaek said pepsi cola is very big in the soviet union and the 
russians also want pizza huts and kentucky fried chicken both 
owned by pepsi 
the soviets prefer to trade goods for goods because of their 
deficit of foreign currency he told the associated press 
pepsi markets soviet vodka but wants to replace the liquor in 
the bartering arrangement because vodka sales plummeted following a 
us boycott over the 1979 soviet intervention in afghanistan 
swedens absolut vodka picked up much of the market and pepsi 
ended up being paid with a product it couldnt sell libaek 
said 
he said pepsi will get 25 percent of the ships sale price to 
help cover pepsi imports 
the norwegian business magazine economic report reported today 
that pepsis business in the soviet union will reach 600 million 
in 1990 
the letter of intent to buy the ships was signed by fram 
shipping the bermudabased operation of norwegian shipowner per a 
arneberg a close friend of pepsi head don kendall the magazine 
said 
fram pepsi libaek and the soviet government also formed the 
joint venture norsov ship to supply norwegian technology to the 
five soviet yards chosen to build the vessels libaek said 
under the barter arrangement the soviet shipyards will supply 
vessels including tankers and freighters contracts have been 
signed for two ships nine more are pending and a letter of intent 
covers the rest 
you dont sign contracts for 85 ships in one day it will take 
time libaek said

pal maleter a 39yearold hungarian 
general told his wife that his countrymen desperately needed him 
during their uprising against the soviets in 1956 and off he went 
on a course that led to his execution 
my husband said in a situation like this one cannot place 
ones family over the needs of an entire nation said his widow 
now judith gyenes 
maleter was executed in 1958 for his role in the failed revolt 
against soviet domination along with the defiant premier imre nagy 
and others the executions were carried out in secret and announced 
later without elaboration unofficial reports at the time said they 
were hanged 
now after 30 years in the course of renewed attempts at 
wideranging political reforms the leaders of the 1956 uprising 
held in disgrace by the communists are reemerging in the official 
consciousness as pioneers of reform 
for three decades ms gyenes and other relatives of the revolts 
leaders have fought for their official recognition as patriots 
rather than counterrevolutionaries 
the communist party leadership at a meeting in february 
partially reassessed its evaluation of the 1956 events as a 
counterrevolution acknowledging that it also bore elements of a 
popular uprising 
as the communist partys ideologist janos berecz had said 
recently that political rehabilitation of the 1956 leaders is under 
way with publication of three books on nagy and the revolt on 
wednesday berecz was one of four conservatives removed from the 
politburo in a move that appears to strengthen party leaders who 
favor introducing a multiparty system 
the relatives also have been given official permission to rebury 
their loved ones in marked graves 
the bodies of nagy maleter and three others have been exhumed 
from unmarked graves in plot no 301 of budapests sprawling 
rakoskeresztur cemetery the funeral is set for june 16 the 
anniversary of nagys execution 
nevertheless maleters widow says the government still has a 
long way to go to face up to the tragedy of the 1956 revolt 
i dont think the authorities have come to the stage where 
they can confront the whole nature of this and see it for the 
travesty of justice that it was she said in an interview in 
budapest where she is a librarian 
according to western estimates as many as 30000 people died in 
the uprising which began oct 23 1956 and was brought to a 
bloody end by soviet troops and tanks nov 4 
ms gyenes now 55 and remarried remembers the last time she 
saw her maleter as a free man 
it was nov 3 1956 and he had just been named nagys defense 
minister and was appointed to head the hungarian delegation to 
negotiate with kremlin emissaries on the withdrawal of soviet 
troops 
nagy had declared hungary a neutral country and withdrew it from 
the sovietled warsaw pact military alliance 
my husband was optimistic ms gyenes said but she added 
that she was extremely upset that he was going to a soviet military 
base for the negotiations with the kremlin officials 
the next day maleter and his entire delegation were under 
soviet arrest 
two years later nagy maleter and an estimated 2000 others were 
executed 
ms gyenes was allowed to see her imprisoned husband only twice 
before his death and received just two letters from him they had 
no children 
this whole episode was one of the most infamous occurrences in 
hungarian history she said 
when the revolt broke out maleter commanded a column of 
hungarian tanks that rushed to budapests kilian barracks to defend 
it against rebels but after speaking to some of them he joined 
the revolt and announced he was turning the barracks over to the 
revolutionaries a key factor in solidifying popular support for 
the uprising 
ms gyenes said an enormous crowd gathered to hear maleter speak 
at the barracks 
i was amazed that this unknown military man all of a sudden 
was a popular hero she said 
a leading communist reformer in todays hungary imre pozsgay 
has said the national consensus needed to overcome the countrys 
current problems can only be achieved by clearing up the past 
maleters widow agrees 
it is my conviction that until justice is served there is 
no way we can speak of any kind of consensus or a new social 
contract she said

mexicos reputed no 1 drug dealer 
miguel angel felix gallardo hails from this narcotics trafficking 
center thats been known as little chicago for its legacy of 
gangland murder 
drug agents in this sinaloa state capital have discovered fields 
of marijuana outside town that were irrigated and nurtured like any 
other crop fivethousand tons were burned in one raid in 1984 
culiacan also is home to a shrine to the narcosanton or 
big narcosaint jesus malverde a common criminal who died in 
1909 and is believed by some to provide protection and cure 
illnesses 
the shrine condemned as pagan by the roman catholic church is 
less than a block from the statehouse in culiacan a city of 13 
million people about 850 miles northwest of mexico city 
in 1985 and 1986 culiacan became known as little chicago 
because there were so many killings an average of five a day 
according to the book desperados by elaine shannon people 
were afraid to sit by their windows for fear of stray bullets the 
book quotes an unidentified army officer as saying more than 500 
girls were kidnapped and raped during those years 
reports that felix gallardo was at one time hiding out in the 
governors house were taken seriously although the governor denied 
the allegation 
when federal authorities decided to move against felix gallardo 
and corrupt officials on saturday they trusted culiacans police 
so little they took the entire force all 600 of them into custody 
army troops had been dispatched to arrest top local and state 
police officials 
but culiacan was not felix gallardos home at the time of his 
arrest he moved to guadalajara mexicos secondlargest city 
years ago and thats where he was caught 
on wednesday federal prosecutors charged him with criminal 
conspiracy and illegal possession of weapons on tuesday he was 
charged with multiple counts of possessing transporting and 
trading in illegal drugs 
he has issued no plea 
about 200 special agents on wednesday checked records at banks 
and land offices in five states seeking millions of dollars in 
hidden bank accounts and properties 
after agent enrique camarena salazar of the us drug 
enforcement administration was slain in march 1985 a killing 
felix gallardo reported opposed the accused drug lord lived under 
cover and moved frequently us officials say 
he managed to escape the clutches of mexican police for years 
because corrupt officials allegedly protected him 
officials estimate felix gallardos holdings are worth more than 
500 million much of it invested in legitimate businesses in 
culiacan and guadalajara he had 50 cars at least three airplanes 
and raised thoroughbred horses they say 
on wednesday federal police and troops shuttered businesses of 
suspected drug traffickers in culiacan and pickup trucks loaded 
with soldiers occasionally cruised the streets 
the chamber of commerce disputed claims that felix gallardo was 
a major player in culiacans economy 
i dont believe the economy here benefited significantly from 
felix gallardo from what i know he invested his money in many 
places said francisco javier partida perez the chamber director 
people say felix gallardo rarely was seen in public in recent 
years and questions about him were met with suspicion 
why do you want to know who are you asked a cashier in 
response to a question about what she thought of his arrest 
most officials were unavailable for comment 
the mayor was too busy to receive reporters the governor was 
meeting with the president in mexico city the acting police chief 
referred all questions to the prosecutors office and the 
prosecutor was in meetings 
its a hot potato nobody wants to touch it said a police 
officer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the police for their part appeared to be more upset about 
being held in custody for 24 hours than anything else 
local police officers were detained saturday to avoid leaks or a 
shootout while federal authorities arrested officials who allegedly 
took bribe money from felix gallardo those seized included the 
states top drugenforcement officer and the city police chief 
one culiacan officer worried about how the case would affect his 
departments image 
it hurts our reputation he said now people will think 
were all crooked

abbie hoffman was an american legend who stayed true to his 
beliefs long after his contemporaries sold out to the establishment 
he had rallied young people against during the 1960s friends and 
family said 
its the end of an era said hoffmans younger brother jack 
abbie hoffman was found dead in his home in bucks county pa 
by a neighbor wednesday night the cause of death was not 
immediately known 
he was 52 years old and i think he gave up said jack 
hoffman in a telephone interview from his suburban boston home 
my brother packed in a lot of miles in his life maybe he was 
tired i know he was disappointed in the young people of today he 
didnt feel he was getting through to them 
he was disenchanted 
hoffman gained national attention as a member of the chicago 
seven a group of radicals who led hundreds of protesters at the 
1968 democratic national convention in chicago 
he remained steadfast to his leftist beliefs to the end 
to me he was a genius who was able to organize large numbers 
of people motivate them and reach them in ways that nobody else 
could do said hoffmans attorney gerald lefcourt of new york 
city his approach was always unique and amusing but also 
convincing and who dedicated his life to the things that he 
believed in changing 
said john oakes hoffmans publisher he was somebody who 
stayed true to what he believed in unlike so many of his 
contemporaries who sold out and became just what they detested when 
they were 20 years old 
i find him inspiring and i hope a whole new generation will 
find his example something to aspire to said oakes 
hoffman however criticized todays campuses as bastions of 
rest and last week said the interest young people have in the 
60s disturbed him 
nostalgia is a sign of middleage he said before an 
appearance last week at vanderbilt university in nashville tenn 
were reminiscing about our youth when you see young people 
nostalgic for a youth they didnt even experience its a little 
sad theyre supposed to be out making one for themselves 
at vanderbilt hoffman participated in a panel discussion with 
other 60s activists including psychedelic drug guru dr timothy 
leary 
oh god im stunned he was brilliant remarked leary when 
reached at his los angeles home wednesday night and told of 
hoffmans death 
later after collecting his thoughts leary added 
abbie hoffman was an american legend he was up there in the 
hall of fame with rebel huck finn rowdy babe ruth crazy lenny 
bruce he was the pete rose of the 60s counterculture a hustler 
a base stealer a wild free spirit and a gambler he is a historic 
figure and a great american and i loved the guy 
lefcourt remembered hoffmans sense of humor which really 
covered his outrage at a lot of injustice that he saw hoffman 
made a few appearances as a standup comedian last year 
he threw money on the american stock exchange floor in the 
late 60s and was able to show in that satirical event when 
hundreds of people on the stock exchange on wall street chased 
flying money on the floor how silly it all was said lefcourt 
jack hoffman said he hoped history would treat his brother more 
kindly than did life 
he was a great patriot he said he loved america and he 
loved the system because it allowed him to do what he did 
protest 
now hoffman said a great american story has ended 
i guess now they can make the movie he said we talked 
about writing a script but there were always problems with the 
ending i guess now we know how it goes

british engineers headed for australia 
today to install a new rudder on a british airways concorde jet 
that lost part of its tail while trying to set speed records on an 
worldcircling journey 
the concorde was flying at about 1500 miles per hour from 
christchurch new zealand to sydney on wednesday when a large 
chunk of the tail fin disintegrated at about 40000 feet over the 
tasman sea the airline said 
spokeswoman katherine wilson said specialists due in sydney 
today would work through the night to repair the damage so the 
plane can leave on the next leg perth in western australia on 
friday as scheduled 
in london a company spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping 
with british custom said spare parts left london on wednesday with 
two engineers 
the threeweek journey started in london april 1 with 100 
american passengers including commentator william f buckley who 
each paid 39000 to travel supersonic for 38343 miles 
the planes pilot capt david leney said he was climbing out 
of christchurch at mach 18 nearly twice the speed of sound when 
there was a very slight bang 
there was no indication at all what it was he told a news 
conference we decided to carry on the airplane was carrying on 
perfectly in every way 
leney said he had no idea what was wrong until he was alerted by 
the control tower at sydneys kingsfordsmith international airport 
i was very surprised to see just what was missing he said 
i felt slightly shaken one doesnt like to see ones airplane 
with a piece missing 
passengers contacted by the ap said the plane shuddered 
about 25 minutes out of christchurch 
british airways would not detail the extent of damage but 
photographs of the plane showed a large chunk missing from the rear

a vagrant forced out of an apartment house 
hours before it was set on fire has been charged with nine arson 
deaths and authorities say he should have been in jail for another 
case but ignored a judges order 
joe pickens 34 never reported to the peoria county jail on 
march 31 to serve a 30day sentence for a misdemeanor court 
records show 
no arrest warrant was issued and now pickens faces more serious 
crimes nine counts of firstdegree murder and two counts of 
aggravated arson in the worst fire in the history of this central 
illinois city 
i dont fault the sheriff or the jail states attorney 
kevin lyons said wednesday 
the missed jail date was included on the jails list of 
violations to be brought to lyons attention an action the jail 
takes about every two weeks the prosecutor said 
pickens a native of york ala was charged with the deaths 
wednesday one day after a fire set in a vacant firstfloor 
apartment spread and killed seven children and two young mothers on 
the second floor 
pickens confessed to setting the fire after saying it started 
accidentally according to police superintendent allen andrews 
pickens apparently stayed at the twostory house in the past and 
was put out of the house monday night but he came back said 
fire chief g john parker 
parker said he did not know why pickens had been forced to leave 
circuit judge robert a barnes set bond at 2 million and 
scheduled a hearing for may 5 
neighbors in the workingclass area of town expressed shock 
im angry and hurt and surprised hed so something like that 
to those folks said claudie garner who lives across the street 
with her husband jim and their nine children they were nice 
and never did anything to hurt anyone 
pickens was supposed to surrender to serve the month for 
resisting arrest his 22nd misdemeanor conviction since 1983 court 
records show 
the records show his most frequent address was the peoria rescue 
mission where superintendent richard brienen recalled an incident 
in which pickens threw bricks at the building after being ejected 
for violating house rules 
my nickname for him was trouble brienen said the guys 
used to call him trash can joe sometimes when hed get kicked

an investment company founded by former 
us treasury secretary william simon and three former marriott 
corp executives have been identified as suitors for northwest 
airlines according to reports published today 
the two groups are contending with los angeles billionaire 
marvin davis who has submitted a 262 billion bid to take over 
the nations fourth largest airline 
amid speculation of bidders other than davis the stock of nwa 
inc northwests parent closed wednesday up 1 at 90 surpassing 
davis offer of 90 a share 
one of the other bidders is wesray capital corp a new york 
investment company founded by simon the st paul pioneer press 
dispatch reported today 
bruce retrum a union leader for some of northwests 6500 
flight attendants told the newspaper that saunders miller a 
minneapolis financial consultant contacted him to try to set up a 
meeting with union leaders and a wesray representative to discuss a 
leveraged buyout 
there were no specifics but my assumption was that he wanted 
to talk about an esop employee stock ownership plan or some 
employee stock ownership said retrum secretarytreasurer of 
teamsters local 2747 
the meeting was scheduled for today but then postponed by 
miller retrum said miller declined to comment 
last week a spokesman for simon said he wasnt interested in 
buying northwest 
meanwhile the star tribune in minneapolis reported today that 
the third suitor includes gary l wilson a walt disney executive 
who left northwests board in november al checchi a los angeles 
businessman and frederick malek a former member of the nixon 
white house and campaign adviser to president bush 
all three are former executives of marriott a travel 
conglomerate that provides northwest and other airlines inflight 
meal service 
william genoese airline director for the international 
brotherhood of teamsters said checchi and wilson have informed him 
that their group owns 49 percent of northwests stock and wants to 
buy the company the star tribune reported 
checchi through an assistant in his los angeles office 
declined to comment wilson was traveling in europe and was 
unavailable for comment 
but a spokesman for malek confirmed the existence of checchis 
group the spokesman said malek is a passive investor in a 
partnership headed by mr checchi 
on march 28 northwest disclosed the checchi groups existence 
but not its identity northwest said the group suggested a friendly 
leveraged buyout the companys board rejected that overture and 
also announced the adoption of a corporate poison pill to 
discourage a hostile takeover 
the disclosure sent the carriers stock price soaring and 
spurred davis who holds a 3 percent stake in northwest to make 
his 90 per share bid the board rejected davis bid last week 
davis an oil mogul with interests in real estate and 
entertainment has said he plans a shareholder proxy fight to win 
control of the airlines board at nwas may 15 shareholders meeting 
northwest has asked a federal judge to prevent davis from 
meddling with its unions while davis has filed a separate lawsuit 
seeking to invalidate northwests poison pill antitakeover 
plan

the forewoman of a jury that convicted a man of 
five northern california trailside murders improperly knew about 
his criminal past a judge has ruled 
although wednesdays finding could lead to a new trial for david 
joseph carpenter superior court judge herbert b hoffman did not 
overturn carpenters conviction or vacate the death sentence 
imposed for the 1980 marin county parkland slayings 
im absolutely convinced that the evidence in this case is 
overwhelming beyond a shadow of a doubt as it applies to 
carpenters guilt and sentencing hoffman said thats one of 
the reasons i find this decision distasteful to make 
prosecutors were given until may 1 to file briefs stating their 
reasons why carpenter 58 of san francisco should not be retried 
on grounds that jury forewoman barbara durhams misconduct tainted 
the jurys findings 
defense attorneys will have three weeks to file their reply 
before both sides return to court june 1 
whether this juror misconduct is something that will overturn 
this conviction is something well have to decide hoffman said 
the ruling culminated a threemonth hearing involving 
allegations that durham found out during carpenters sixmonth 
trial that he already was on death row for two similar 1981 
killings in santa cruz county 
im confident my decision regarding mrs durhams jury 
misconduct is correct but it does not please me said hoffman 
who expressed sorrow for the victims families 
this has to be something that is going to be devastating to 
them hoffman said about the possible retrial 
two acquaintances of mrs durham testified during the hearing 
that she indicated in a march 26 1988 dinner conversation that 
she knew about carpenters involvement in the santa cruz killings 
defense attorneys who filed the retrial motion contend such 
knowledge was prejudicial enough to carpenters defense to warrant 
a new trial 
hoffman had issued a pretrial ruling that barred jurors from 
knowing about carpenters previous conviction and death sentence 
michael lustig a san diego businessman and his former 
girlfriend barbara duran both quoted mrs durham as saying im 
not supposed to know this but the defendant has been convicted of 
doing the same thing in another county and has been sentenced to 
death 
mrs durham denied she made such a statement 
but hoffman said mrs durham appeared extremely nervous when she 
took the stand to respond to the allegations and the judge added he 
felt her memory was selective 
the judge said he would leave it up to the san diego county 
district attorneys office to decide whether mrs durham should be 
prosecuted for discussing the case before the end of the trial 
carpenter who has spent most of his adult life behind bars was 
convicted last may of the nineweek murder spree at point reyes 
national seashore and mount tamalpais state park 
the death penalty automatically will be appealed to the state 
supreme court where carpenters appeal of the santa cruz 
conviction is pending

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said talk 
of peace is seductive but negotiations with the palestine 
liberation organization would only lead to war 
i would sit with anyone if i thought for one minute that it 
would bring a just and lasting peace to our country and to our 
region shamir told the foreign policy association on wednesday 
but i know and everyone who is familiar with our region 
should know that negotiations with the plo will not bring peace 
they are a sure prescription for war and while i shall do anything 
i can for peace i shall not lend myself to moves which will make 
another war inevitable 
shamirs speech before the foreign policy association a 
nonprofit organization whose goal is to promote public 
understanding of international issues concluded a 10day us 
visit in which he met with president bush in washington shamir was 
to leave for home today 
the israeli government is under pressure from the united states 
to open talks with the plo now that its leader yasser arafat 
publicly recognized israels right to exist and renounced terrorism 
during his washington visit shamir proposed allowing 
palestinians who live in the west bank and gaza strip to elect 
representatives to negotiate a form of selfrule the proposal 
received support from us officials 
the plo said monday that any elections in the territories should 
be held after an israeli withdrawal and under international 
supervision according to the plo news agency wafa

intelligence agents arrested a 
dissident leader aboard a plane today as he returned from 
reunification talks in communist north korea and police rounded up 
about 800 radicals who protested the arrest 
about 20 officials of the agency for national security planning 
south koreas main intelligence agency boarded a northwest orient 
flight from tokyo and arrested rev moon ikhwan on charges of 
violating national security laws moons companion yoo wonho was 
also arrested 
moon was led down a stairway on to the tarmac after agents 
pounded on one of the planes door demanding it be opened the 
71yearold dissident was quickly driven away in a black car as 
intelligence agents ringed the area 
about 4000 riot policemen ringed kimpo airport to prevent 
radicals from greeting moon and arrested about 60 dissidents and 
students who yelled slogans and unfurled banners after sneaking 
into the terminal 
moon created a major political controversy in the south by 
making a secret visit to north korea last month to meet with 
communist leader kim il sung to discuss ways to reunite the divided 
korean peninsula 
the government ordered a major crackdown on dissidents and the 
visit threatened to stall peace talks between the two koreas 
south koreans cannot visit the north without government 
permission 
thousands of radical students staged violent protests in at 
least five cities in support of moon clashing with riot police 
when they were blocked from marching off campuses police said they 
had no figures on how many students took part but korean press 
reports said about 10000 students protested at 23 colleges 
nationwide 
police detained about 700 radicals who tried to get to yonsei 
university in seoul for a rally to welcome moon police said 
another 50 students were arrested when about 1000 protesters 
marched out of the campus peacefully and police armored vans fired 
tear gas 
students at four other colleges in seoul hurled firebombs and 
rocks at police who fired tear gas and hurled rocks back in clashes 
around the campuses about 3000 students clashed with police in 
the southern port of pusan some 2000 students fought police in 
kwangju in the south and violent clashes were also reported in 
taegu and chunchon 
murderer president roh taewoo cannot arrest moon ikhwan 
students yelled 
south korean officials said north koreas dealings with moon 
were an attempt to undermine the seoul governments authority they 
say moon and other dissidents are aiding north korean attempts to 
gain control of the peninsula 
prosecutors said moon would be charged with visiting north korea 
to receive instructions from a hostile government and for 
praising antistate elements if convicted moon could face 
anywhere from five years in prison to the death sentence although 
there is little chance he would be executed 
the two koreas have been bitter rivals since the korean 
peninsula was divided after world war ii ended in 1945 north korea 
invaded the south in 1950 at the start of the bloody threeyear 
korean war 
many south koreans were outraged when state television showed 
pictures of moon embracing kim il sung and complimenting the 
communist strongman for his leadership kim is feared and hated in 
the south for having ordered the 1950 invasion and many south 
koreans fear the totalitarian north still wants to conquer the 
south 
moons visit to north korea appears to have damaged south 
koreas dissident movement by linking it to the north north 
dissident leaders publicly have defended moons trip but privately 
concede it has damaged their credibility 
the dissidents and radical students have been waging a violent 
campaign to try and oust the roh government they have little 
public support but their frequent demonstrations have caused 
widespread concern about south koreas political stability 
dissidents deny they are pronorth korea but many insist the 
two koreas must be reunited immediately and differences in the two 
nations political systems be resolved later 
the government used moons visit to order a series of crackdowns 
on the dissidents five senior dissident leaders have been arrested 
as part of the crackdown and police have taken tougher measures 
against violent protests

the stench of death lingers at the 
ranch where police dug up the bodies of 12 men who cult members say 
were used in ritual sacrifices or klled for drugrelated revenge 
inside a small hut with tar paper siding and a corrugated metal 
roof the odor of decomposing tissue was overwhelming wednesday 
afternoon 
police say suspects told them the building was used for carrying 
out the killings 
scattered on the stained fetid floor of the approximately 
15by30foot shack were bullet casings cigars chili peppers 
broken glass and empty liquor bottles 
outside the door a castiron caldron held brains and other 
organs a turtle shell a horseshoe and other objects in a thick 
dark liquid smaller bowls nearby held a dead rooster charred goat 
heads and other objects that had been cooked 
a windowsill held what looked like a birds nest made of tissue 
paper and human hair 
what appeared to be skin from a human hand was floating in a 
yellowish liquid inside a piece of tractor tire about 20 yards 
away near the grave of mark kilroy a 21yearold university of 
texas student who disappeared march 14 while on spring break in 
matamoros 
the victims were exhumed tuesday from nine shallow graves in or 
near a corral on the 20acre ranch area that borders on farm fields 
cult members said they were involved in the killings for about 
nine months according to investigators kilroy and some other 
victims were hacked to death with a machete authorities said 
its beyond belief of anybody that lives in a civilized 
nation said texas attorney general jim mattox who visited the 
site 
he said kilroy was found with a wire inserted in his spine and 
the cult had planned to use it later to extract the vertebrae for 
use in necklaces 
mexican federal judicial police have arrested five men and were 
searching for several other people including the cults 
godfather who told members the ritual killings would bring them 
demonic protection from enemies 
we killed them for protection one of the suspects elio 
hernandez rivera 22 of matamoros told reporters at a news 
conference 
cult members were importing about 1000 pounds of marijuana a 
month into the united states mattox said 
very clearly they believed the human sacrifices and the animal 
sacrifices put a magical shield around them that protected them 
from evil or harm even up to bullets mattox said

the soviet union will leave the orbiting space 
station mir unmanned for three months because of delays in 
preparing equipment that cosmonauts need to perform experiments 
aboard the spacecraft tass says 
the news agency said wednesday that cosmonauts alexander volkov 
sergei krikalev and valery polyakov will return to earth april 27 
leaving the mir station mothballed for only the second time since 
it was launched in 1986 
when three soviet cosmonauts return back to earth from their 
orbiting station mir in about a fortnight the facility will be 
left unmanned for several months due to delays with the preparation 
of two research modules deputy flight director viktor blagov 
told tass 
this is because without the two modules which will make it 
possible to conduct wideranging research including studies in the 
interest of the soviet economy there is little sense in keeping 
cosmonauts on the space station any further blagov told the news 
agency 
tass first announced tuesday that the cosmonauts would return 
and leave the station without a crew but the report wednesday 
contained the first explanation of why the project was being 
suspended 
some speculated the suspension was for economic reasons the 
move was announced after critics called for deep cuts in spending 
on the space program the announcement also came shortly after the 
soviets lost two probes to mars at a cost of nearly 480 million 
the mothballing of mir makes economic sense blagov said he 
said that expensive new equipment both on the ground and on the 
space station was needed as well as training of future cosmonauts 
it is fairly difficult to do this in the course of a manned 
flight so the adjournment will simplify many things he said 
the move also announced on the evening television news program 
vremya effectively cancels the launch of cosmonauts alexander 
balandin and alexander viktorenko scheduled for april 19 
the announcement coincided with cosmonauts day the anniversary 
of yuri gagarins first manned space flight 28 years ago which was 
marked wednesday night with a sevenminute fireworks display that 
lit up the sky over moscow 
blagov defended the cost of the space program 
we plan to promote space commercial services and have already 
begun to do this of the 19 agreements signed by the soviet space 
agency glavkosmos with other countries and foreign firms 10 have 
been carried out he said 
blagov admitted that the soviet union was not capitalizing on 
space exploration soviet space technology is up to the highest 
world standards but industrial spinoffs are pitifully scanty as 
very few of the space industrys achievements are turned over for 
commercial use he said 
mir which the soviets have said is the first building block of 
a permanently manned space station has been mothballed only once 
before a sevenmonth period following the return to earth of its 
first inhabitants vladimir solovev and leonid kizim june 25 
1986 after three months in space 
since the arrival of cosmonauts yuri romanenko and alexander 
laveikin in february 1987 the spacecraft has been manned 
on dec 20 cosmonauts vladimir titov and musa manarov set a 
worlds record for space endurance living aboard the mir orbiter 
for 365 days and 22 hours 
they were joined in the final months of their recordsetting 
space voyage by polyakov a physician who traveled to the mir 
station on aug 28 to monitor the effects of living in a 
gravityfree environment for extended periods 
titov and manarov were replaced by krikalev and volkov polyakov 
stayed aboard the orbiter to continue experiments in space health 
techniques

barbara bushs most recognizable feature her 
silvery hair may also be a sign of her most recent medical 
problem an overactive thyroid gland doctors say 
although no one knows exactly why prematurely gray hair and an 
illness called graves disease sometimes go together 
graves disease occurs when the thyroid glands in the neck churn 
out too much hormone causing a variety of seemingly unrelated 
symptoms the ailment is fairly rare but easily treatable with 
radioactive iodine a therapy that mrs bush received wednesday 
many of us worried about her thyroid long ago when we heard 
about the premature graying of her hair said dr gilbert h 
daniels of massachusetts general hospital in boston 
mrs bushs hair turned white three decades ago when she was in 
her early 30s untimely gray hair certainly isnt harmful but 
people who get it are also at higher than usual risk of graves 
disease as well as several other conditions including diabetes 
pernicious anemia and white skin patches called vitiligo 
graves disease which afflicts four in every 1000 people is 
an inherited disorder caused by a mixup in the bodys 
diseasefighting immune system the body produces antibodies that 
mistakenly attack the thyroid gland as an enemy instead of harming 
the gland they stimulate it to grow and work nonstop producing 
too much thyroid hormone though the tendency is passed from parent 
to child no one knows precisely what triggers the antibody attack 
to occur 
the overabundance of this hormone called thyroxine speeds up 
the bodys chemical reactions like mrs bush victims may lose 
weight and have irritated eyes frequently they complain of gritty 
feeling eyes or blurred vision 
symptoms vary from person to person but can also include 
anxiety and fidgetiness people may have trouble sleeping and 
their hands may tremble 
insensitivity to cold victims may feel comfortable in summer 
clothes on cold days and complain that rooms are too warm 
rapid heartbeat the heart works harder than necessary and 
this may be dangerous in people with underlying heart disease 
enlarged thyroid gland a condition known as goiter 
protruding eyes that make people seem to be staring 
in the untreated state it can certainly be lifethreatening 
but these days we recognize and treat it very readily said dr 
david madoff of johns hopkins university 
the most common treatment is radioactive iodine which when 
introduced 50 years ago was one of the first medical uses of 
radioactive material 
the thyroid gland needs iodine to make hormone and absorbs it 
readily however the gland cannot distinguish radioactive iodine 
from the normal variety 
with this treatment patients take a pill or drink radioactive 
iodine the material is taken up by the thyroid gland and over a 
period of months largely destroys it leaving the gland shrunken 
and unable to make enough hormone as a result patients usually 
must take thyroid pills for the rest of their lives 
it is simple safe and effective said daniels and does not 
cause cancer or other health problems 
for a few days after treatment however people may give off 
slightly elevated amounts of radiation 
you have to avoid close contact with people for the next week 
and flush the toilet bowl twice for the next three days said 
madoff because iodine not absorbed by the thyroid is excreted in 
the urine 
medicine and surgery are also used to treat the disease while 
antithyroid drugs can make people feel better the disease usually 
returns when people stop taking them surgery accomplishes the same 
result as radioactive iodine but requires anesthesia and can 
occasionally result in damage to the nearby parathyroid glands 
graves disease named for irish physician robert james graves 
who described it in 1835 is about eight times more common in women 
than in men

soviet authorities will begin rationing sugar in 
moscow next month a newspaper said in a move that is likely to 
increase discontent with the effects of the nations economic 
reforms 
sugar has been rationed in many areas of the soviet union for 
months but some muscovites said the limits on sugar purchases 
announced in the moskovskaya pravda newspaper are the first decreed 
in the capital since world war ii 
demand for sugar skyrocketed in the soviet union after soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev launched his antialcohol campaign in 
april 1985 which included sharp cuts in the production of vodka 
and other alcoholic beverages 
gorbachev and other soviet officials have blamed the increase in 
sugar consumption since then on soviets who buy the substance to 
brew samogon or moonshine at home 
limits on sugar sales without precedent in the lifetime of many 
muscovites seemed certain to increase anger over the effects of 
gorbachevs reforms many soviets say perestroika or 
restructuring has not improved their traditionally dreary diet or 
put better quality goods in the stores 
moskovskaya pravda in its tuesday editions quoted valery a 
zharov chief of the consumer trading department of the moscow city 
government as saying the sugar boom in moscow began in april 
1988 and that the product disappeared then from city stores 
the citys government requested an extra 50000 tons of sugar to 
meet increased demand but consumption again shot up in february 
zharov said 
he blamed the latest jump in demand on the imposition of sugar 
rationing in most areas of the russian federation and in the other 
republics of the soviet union meaning outsiders were stocking up 
on sugar while in moscow 
the capital was again given an additional 40000 tons of sugar 
zharov said but the additional supply did not satisfy demand 
for example in march we sold 2000 tons daily said 
zharov but 600800 tons is considered the norm for the city 
no matter how sad it is we are forced to introduce coupons 
for the right to buy sugar he said in may to every 
muscovite including children and temporary residents we will 
guarantee two kilogarams 44 pounds of sugar 
that quantity will be increased to 66 pounds per muscovite in 
june and july the season when many people traditionally make fruit 
preserves he said 
asked how long moscow residents will need ration cards to buy 
sugar zharov said the system should remain in place until the end 
of the year 
he said the moscow city council would meet saturday to discuss 
when and how to implement the rationingcard system 
other food products have been rationed since world war ii in 
moscow including flour in the 1960s 
in many other regions of the soviet union people have needed 
talons or ration cards to buy meat sausage and other 
foodstuffs for years

the leader of a drug trafficking gang accused of 
ritually killing 12 people near matamoros mexico grew up in a 
cubanamerican family that practiced santeria animal sacrifices 
authorities believe 
residents of the middleclass neighborhood in west dade county 
where adolfo de jesus constanzo 26 lived until 1984 said they 
found headless chickens geese and goats on their doorsteps and in 
the streets near his home the miami herald reported today 
such animals are ritually sacrificed by followers of santeria a 
religion that mixes elements of christianity with african animism 
the mother was in santeria said norma brito who bought the 
constanzos house after their bank foreclosed in 1984 ms brito 
said she found the remains of an altar with candles wax and fruit 
when she moved in 
they had sheep and chicken in the back yard said carmen 
reigada another neighbor they were troublemakers 
mrs reigada said she discovered a headless chicken on her 
doorstep after her son quarreled with constanzos mother aurora 
del valle de posada the herald reported constanzo was the oldest 
of four children 
both mexican and us police said the suspects in the killings 
described the rituals as cuban santeria sacrifices taught to them 
by constanzo 
there is no evidence however that santeria has ever sanctioned 
human sacrifices said mercedes sandoval an anthropology professor 
at miamidade community college who has studied the religion for 
three decades 
these may have been a group of deranged people who may have 
started with santeria and ended with these barbarities she said 
but what they did is not santeria 
santeria was introduced to cuba by african slaves who blended 
their polytheistic beliefs with roman catholic dogma identified 
african gods by the names of catholic saints and carried out 
animal sacrifices to summon those gods sandoval said 
metrodade police said they couldnt confirm whether constanzo 
whom they arrested twice for shoplifting in 1981 was the same man 
being sought as the godfather of the drugsmuggling ring 
officer george gabito of the cameron county sheriffs department 
in brownsville texas said authorities suspect constanzo is the 
gangs leader us and mexican authorities were searching for him 
today and said they believe constanzo is in the united states 
after one of his 1981 shoplifting arrests constanzo told police 
he was born in miami beach and was a student at miamidade 
community college the registrar at the college said constanzo took 
classes there about 198081 but did not graduate 
neighbors said constanzo traveled back and forth to mexico 
shortly thereafter the herald reported

fires that scorched 32000 acres of driedout 
sawgrass and threw a haze over south florida dwindled after 
thunderstorms and only a few scattered hot spots remained today 
a cold front moving down the florida peninsula shifted the wind 
and blew away the dense smoke cover which had forced the temporary 
evacuation of nearly 750 wouldbe immigrants from a detention 
facility at the edge of the everglades 
the state division of forestry announced late wednesday that 
large brushfires in western dade county and smaller blazes in palm 
beach county had been contained with just a few pockets 
burning 
larry lahiff of the national weather service said forecasters 
expected continued showers tonight he said a strong shift in wind 
direction dispersed the smoke but sent some of it over key west 
and the fort myers region 
theres still some haze but in the lower levels of the 
atmosphere its been keeping fairly clear lahiff said

israeli police and soldiers 
shot and killed five palestinians and wounded at least 15 today in 
two clashes in occupied west bank hospital officials said 
most of the casualties occurred in the village of nahalin where 
israeli border police killed four palestinians and wounded at least 
15 while trying to make arrests before dawn the hospital officials 
said 
israeli troops opened fire on rioters in nearby bethlehem and 
killed at least one palestinian hospital officials said another 
resident reportedly died of wounds from an earlier clash 
israeli military officials confirmed just one palestinian died 
and four were wounded in the raid on nahalin other arab reports 
said as many as six palestinians were killed today and israel 
radio reported dozens were wounded 
an ambulance driver interviewed on israel radio said he took 
four bodies from nahalin to the hospital villagers said at least 
one other palestinian was buried without going to a hospital but 
that could not be confirmed 
an army announcement said the shootings in nahalin which is six 
miles south of jerusalem occurred during a predawn arrest raid 
an army spokeswoman told reporters that a senior army commander 
entered nahalin to investigate the shooting 
we are trying to check with the hospitals now initial reports 
indicate the border police went into the village saw activity and 
were attacked she said on condition of anonymity

israeli border police and army soldiers in 35 jeeps staged the raid 
it was a massacre mohammed mustafa 59 a farmer from 
nahalin told a reporter at mukassed hospital in jerusalem the 
army came to kill they fired indiscriminately 
however another arab villager who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said troops opened fire after being attacked with stones 
by a dozen palestinians he said about 70 soldiers were in nahalin 
the army clamped a curfew on nahalin barring journalists and 
forcing the 2000 palestinian residents to stay indoors 
nahali teacher mohammed ali told reporters at beit jalla 
hospital near bethlehem that youths blocked roads and stoned border 
police and soldiers who entered nahali but the troops circumvented 
barricades and entered on foot 
border police got on the roof and fired down on the people 
ali said 
some villagers suggested jewish settlers were involved in the 
shooting but ali said he saw no civilians the rumors added to 
tensions in nearby bethlehem

reported 17yearold daoud khaled nasser died of wounds suffered in 
an april 6 clash with troops reporters had watched nasser killed 
by a soldier who opened fire without warning in apparent violation 
of army regulations

shot were blocked with rocks burning tires and overturned dump 
trucks at least 300 palestinians including women and children 
stoned military jeeps and waved palestinian flags chanting 
slogans they fled into side streets when troops fired tear gas 
rubber bullets and live ammunition 
a palestinian his head wrapped in a mask made from an outlawed 
palestinian flag said the demonstration was to protest the death 
of nasser whom he charged was shot intentionally the army later 
forced reporters out of the city saying it was a closed military 
area

four conservatives have been removed 
from the ruling politburo and replaced by two reformers in a move 
that appears to strengthen communist party leaders who favor 
introducing a multiparty system 
the changes in the partys senior guard wednesday follow its 
endorsement in february of ending the communists political 
monopoly in this country where a 1956 antisoviet uprising was 
brutally crushed by soviet tanks 
last month the party leadership further committed itself to at 
least partially free parliamentary elections next year

syrian and christian gunners battled 
across the capitals dividing green line today blasting harbors 
and residential districts as french envoys tried to arrange 
evacuation of the wounded to a hospital ship 
the shelling complicated the task of an arab league mediation 
panel seeking to enforce a ceasefire and open the way for 
constitutional reforms that could end the sectarian conflict 
the civil war which entered its 15th year today has claimed 
more than 150000 lives 
police said at least four people were killed and 10 wounded in a 
fierce bombardment of residential districts this morning 
in addition four soldiers were killed during the night by 
shells that hit the presidential palace in suburban baabda and the 
defense ministry in neighboring yarze police said the palace and 
defense ministry came under attack again today 
the casualties brought the overall toll to 200 killed and 687 
wounded since the latest fighting broke out march 8 between the 
mainly christian units of army commander gen michel aoun and an 
alliance of syrian soldiers and druse militamen 
rockets fired from multibarreled launchers stationed around 
moslem west beirut rained on and around christian emplacements in 
beirut and jounieh at midmorning said a police spokesman who 
cannot be named under standing rules 
christian gunners retaliated with 155mm barrages aimed at west 
beiruts ein mreisseh seaside residential district and syrian 
batteries stationed near the airport on the citys southern edge 
the spokesman said 
aoun 53 who also heads a christian military cabinet in 
lebanons dual government renewed his demand or a syrian 
withdrawal from lebanon he accused syria of moving gunboats into 
northern lebanon territorial waters 
the syrian military headquarters in lebanon denied the charge 
bernard kouchner frances minister for humanitarian assistance 
said french helicopters would soon begin evacuating wounded 
lebanese to the hospital vessel la rance 
kouchner who arrived tuesday said moslems were to be flown to 
the ship from west beiruts bain militair beach and christians from 
the port of jounieh 12 miles north of beirut 
he did not say where the la rance equipped with 90 beds and an 
operating theater planned to drop anchor but the leftist beirut 
newspaper assafir said it was to remain eight miles off beirut 
a spokesman for acting prime minister salim hoss who heads the 
moslem cabinet said the operation will go into full swing on 
friday 
the spokesman who requested anonymity said another french navy 
auxiliary vessel the tanker penhors planned to sail into lebanese 
waters friday to unload six tons of fuel oil at the moslem terminal 
of zahrani south of beirut and the christian zouk harbor north of 
the capital 
assafir said that under a compromise worked out by kouchner and 
hoss the tanker was to unload two tons in zahrani and four in zouk 
site of beiruts main power plant 
the plant has produced electricity for just one hour a day for 
the past three weeks because the conflict has created a fuel 
shortage 
hoss withdrew his objections to accepting french aid wednesday 
night after president francois mitterrand of france asserted that 
his country was not choosing sides in lebanon 
france which has traditional ties with the christian community 
ruled lebanon from the end of world war until its independence in 
1943 
the rival governments emerged in september after outgoing 
president amin gemayel named aoun a maronite catholic like 
himself to head an interim cabinet until a new head of state was 
elected 
leftists and moslems rejected the appointment on the ground it 
violated an unwritten national covenant making the premier a sunni 
moslem the president a maronite and the parliament speaker a 
shiite moslem 
the current fighting erupted after aoun imposed a naval blockade 
on illegal militia ports that were siphoning off an estimated 100 
million yearly in unpaid customs fees 
syrian forces joined in artillery barrages by druse militiamen 
and backed their siege of the 310square mile christian enclave 
east and north of the divided city

an 18yearold injured in a motorcycle accident 
says words of encouragement recorded by miami dolphins quarterback 
dan marino helped pull him out of his threemonth coma 
i think dan marino is just the greatest football player there 
is and the tape i got from him was really good encouragement 
said brent doyle who is preparing to leave the mediplex rehab 
hospital in thornton a denver suburb on friday a day before his 
19th birthday 
he just said you can snap out of it just keep up the hard 
work me and all the dolphins are cheering for you 100 percent if 
you get better soon you can watch the dolphins and you can watch 
me perform brent said wednesday 
don doyle brents father said he played marinos recorded 
message for his son daily often two or three times during brents 
coma 
the first prognosis was really dim they didnt give him much 
hope at all the father said its a miracle in my opinion 
brent sustained serious head injuries last october when he lost 
control of his motorcycle while riding through the rocky mountains 
foothills west of boulder 
maybe a day or two after the accident a boy and a girl from 
work came up and i was thinking brent was such a dolphins fan it 
sure would be nice to get something from dan marino to give him 
when he gets out of the hospital the older doyle said they 
heard me say this and pursued it 
marinos tape arrived in november 
then in midfebruary a little more than two months after 
receiving marinos taped message brent emerged from the coma 
dr joshua yurfest a physician at mediplex said the talk 
therapy doyle received is controversial among doctors who refer 
to it as coma stim short for coma stimulation 
we believe it makes a difference but we dont know he said 
brent began walking again in time for his best friends wedding 
in march and can now prepare his own meals hes 97 percent 
recovered his father said 
brent says he plans to go ahead with his plans to study acting 
once he completes his rehabilitation 
the greatest thing now other than getting through this and 
still being alive and for the dolphins its really nice just to 
go home brent said

the transfer to st francis medical centers telemetry unit 
reserved for monitoring heart patients also will reduce the chance 
of infection because it is not as large as intensive care mrs

officials are investigating charges of brutality 
in soviet georgia and specifically whether soldiers were armed with 
shovels in a clash that killed 19 protesters the foreign ministry 
said today 
the troops were not supposed to have those spades ministry 
spokesman gennady gerasimov said if the investigation finds they 
beat the protesters with metal shovels there is a question of 
whether these people should be punished or not 
the chief of the republics communist party djhumber 
patiashvili offered to resign after accepting responsibility for 
sundays clash in the central square of tbilisi the capital of 
georgia 
patiashvili said he did not expect fatalities when troops were 
ordered to break up the proindependence demonstration he said 
troops were armed only with nightsticks and shields 
gerasimov justified the decision to clear the square saying 
we should take into account the situation which evolved since 
endless meetings lasted for five days and they all but paralyzed 
the work of enterprises and people also attempted to penetrate the 
territory of government institutions 
on the streets of tbilisi a city of 12 million 900 miles south 
of moscow groups of activists were passing out leaflets and 
spreading rumors the defense ministry newspaper red star said 
today 
some leaflets claim that more than 19 people died sunday said 
an editor at akhalgadra kommunisti the georgian communist youth 
newspaper 
the communist party daily pravda said picketers were calling on 
workers in tbilisi to strike but zirab zomidze an editor at the 
gruzinform news agency said all enterprises were working today and 
that only the university and some schools were disrupted 
foreign reporters have been barred from traveling to georgia 
a curfew remained in effect in the city and alcohol sales were 
restricted gerasimov said 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze who is a georgian and 
served as the georgian party chief from 1972 to 1985 attended a 
meeting of georgian party leaders today no details of the meeting 
were released 
shevardnadze met with 200 georgian nationalists human rights 
activists and strike organizers for almost three hours on wednesday 
in a debate gerasimov described as rather sharp nationalists 
demanded resignation of the government and a special session of the 
georgian parliament to consider secession from the soviet union 
according to official and unofficial sources 
the meeting ended when a number of nationalists walked out in 
frustration said moscow activist alexander podrabinek 
shevardnadze only repeated commonplaces about perestroika 
podrabinek said 
other activists said president mikhail s gorbachevs appeal for 
calm published wednesday in tbilisi would do little good to 
appease the city 
gorbachev rejected the demands of nationalists who seek 
secession from the soviet union and said they were igniting lethal 
strife that damaged his drive for reform 
the summary of gorbachevs remarks carried on the official news 
agency tass blamed actions by irresponsible persons for the 
loss of life apparently exonerating soldiers and police from any 
official blame 
zurab zhankarashvili a tbilisi resident and member of the 
georgian human rights watchdog organization helsinki watch called 
gorbachevs appeal very dry and expressed doubts it would be 
enough to ease tensions 
gorbachev also made a personal appeal for calm in february 1988 
after ethnic strife occurred in armenia and azerbaijan his call 
only momentarily stemmed bloodshed in those southern republics 
where more than 90 people were killed last year 
demonstrations in georgia began april 4 when protesters 
criticized calls from members of the republics ethnic abkhazian 
minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by 
georgians 
other protesters demanded georgia secede from the soviet union 
because of alleged interference from the central government

defense secretary dick cheney struggling to 
cut more than 6 billion from the fiscal 1990 budget has dropped a 
strong hint that the b2 stealth bomber and other hightech weapons 
that havent yet gone into production may be prime targets 
defense sources said cheney also is considering a slowdown in 
the production of trident missile submarines building one every 
two years instead of one a year and might also order some cuts in 
troop strength 
in an interview wednesday with a small group of newspaper 
reporters cheney said he intended to meet an april 25 deadline for 
presenting the administrations military budget proposal to 
congress and that all programs were still on the table even 
personnel levels 
the new defense chief agreed he had made some tentative 
decisions but declined to discuss details 
cheney was then asked however for his views on stretchouts 
slowing the production line for a weapon to reduce the number 
purchased during the year stretchouts frequently end up costing 
the pentagon more over the long run because of less efficiency on 
the production line 
in phrasing the question the reporter cited the b2 bomber and 
the c17 cargo plane two new aircraft programs that are nearing 
the production phase 
it seems to me that if you are talking about relatively 
complex new weapons systems or you are dealing with new technology 
or we dont have a lot of experience then lots of times delay or 
deferral may make sense because you will learn more in the interim 
process get some of the bugs worked out and maybe find ways to 
reduce cost cheney replied 
if on the other hand you are talking about systems where you 
already have a good deal of knowledge experience then when 
you do a stretchout what you do is raise the cost of each item so 
i am in the process of resisting efforts to stretch out where it 
adds significantly to the unit cost 
when you are talking about new technology then im more 
sympathetic to the notion or argument that we ought to defer or 
delay or stretch out the procurement 
a transcript of cheneys interview was released this morning 
spokesmen for the secretary declined to elaborate on his remarks 
other defense officials however who insisted on anonymity 
said cheney was in fact urging a delay in production of b2 
stealth bombers but hadnt decided how long it should be 
the plane described by the air force as a revolutionary advance 
in aviation is designed to be invisible to enemy radar the first 
of the planes was unveiled publicly last november but has yet to 
fly 
cheney who became defense secretary last month after the senate 
rejected president bushs first choice former sen john tower is 
trying to cut roughly 64 billion from the fiscal 1990 budget

the judge in the mcmartin preschool child 
molestation trial says he is considering having the court pay one 
jurors full salary to make sure he can keep a 12member jury and 
avoid a mistrial in the nearly 2yearold trial 
i cant think of anything worse than not getting a decision 
from this jury thats my nightmare superior court judge william 
pounders told reporters in an unusual interview in his chambers 
wednesday if it isnt forthcoming its a major disaster 
he said he took the rare step of talking to reporters while the 
trial was in progress to pressure attorneys to speed their 
presentations 
as the trials second anniversary approaches next week pounders 
said the proceeding is costing taxpayers 100000 a month with the 
total cost of the case since its inception in 1984 reaching 15 
million 
mcmartin preschool director peggy buckey 62 and her son 
raymond 30 are charged with 65 counts of child molestation and 
conspiracy 
the trial was originally being heard by 12 jurors and six 
alternates however two of the six have been dismissed for medical 
reasons two for hardships related to their jobs and one for being 
inattentive during the proceedings 
pounders expressed concern that if he now lets one juror leave 
the trial because of financial hardship he will risk a mistrial 
because there will be no alternates left if another juror becomes 
ill 
jurors still must hear another several months of defense 
testimony prosecution rebuttal and final arguments 
the judge said juror mark bassett told him the company he works 
for in financial trouble and he fears he may be laid off or that 
the company may go out of business he said he might have to leave 
jury duty for which hes paid 10 a day to seek other 
employment 
it may be obvious to the county of los angeles that it would 
cost less to pay him than to mistry this case pounders said the 
judge called such action highly unusual but not unprecedented 
pounders said tuesday he will begin cutting all but the most 
critical witnesses to speed the trial rejecting eight defense 
witnesses 
pounders also said he was not speaking figuratively when he told 
defense attorney danny davis that the case would go to the jury 
over davis dead body 
it is a death struggle for me as far as im concerned the 
judge said if i put the stress on him and he has a heart attack 
or if he puts the stress on me and i have a heart attack that is 
the way it will be

two helicopters with syrian markings attacked two soviet 
auxiliary vessels with rockets namely a sea tugboat and a divers

the reagan administration undermined its own 
war on drugs as it delayed halted or interfered with 
operations that jeopardized support for its policy in central 
america a senate panel reported today 
the government looked the other way according to the report 
when law enforcement agencies learned that drug traffickers were 
protected and aided by some ussupported nicaraguan contras 
members of the honduran military panamanian strongman manuel 
antonio noriega and bahamian officials 
the 437page report was prepared by the senate foreign affairs 
subcommittee on terrorism narcotics and international operations 
whose chairman john f kerry dmass held a series of public 
hearings last year on international drug trafficking 
kerry told a news conference that antidrug enforcement took 
second place to foreign policy mainly for fear of jeopardizing 
the war in nicaragua but he said that same war provided an 
opportunity for drug traffickers to link up with the contras 
and they did 
sen mitch mcconnell rky ranking republican on the 
subcommittee said in a written statement that while he agreed with 
substantial portions of the report there were inaccuracies 
in the representations of fact on the contradrug issue 
he said many of the allegations were old news that was 
considered by the irancontra congressional committee reviewed by 
grand juries or presented in state department reports to congress 
in 198586 
in the most glaring examples of what the committee found to be a 
twofaced policy during the reagan years the report said 
while reports of noriegas drug activities were mounting the 
us government ignored the evidence as the panamanian strongman 
promised to help train contra rebels and offered use of panamanian 
units to strike targets inside nicaragua 
the late cia director william casey justified his failure to 
raise the narcotics issue in a 1985 meeting with noriega the 
report said on grounds that noriega was providing valuable 
support for our policies in central america especially nicaragua 
the drug enforcement administration apparently ignored 
trafficking allegations against noriega because the nowindicted 
strongman also cooperated in dea operations but the dea was 
fooled the report said when noriega used his close relationship 
with the agency to share dea information with traffickers 
when a former honduran military officer who has assisted the 
united states in the contra war became involved in a 
narcoterrorist plot to kill the elected president of honduras 
high officials of the us government interceded in an effort to 
get his sentenced reduced 
the honduran military which the report said consistently 
supported us policies in central america included elements 
that protected the cocaine trade the report said 
the drug enforcement administration opened its first honduran 
office in 1981 and closed it two years later for budgetary 
reasons even though the resident agent there found honduran 
waters were used for drug shipments after the agent was 
transferred to guatemala he continued to spend 70 percent of his 
time dealing with the honduran drug problem the report said 
the government had evidence of numerous drug links involving 
the antisandinista rebels including participation in trafficking 
by individual contras use of contra air strips by traffickers and 
the hiring of four airline companies owned and operated by 
narcotics traffickers to supply humanitarian assistance to the 
contras 
before the state department signed the contracts the report 
said federal law enforcement had received information that the 
individuals controlling these companies were involved in 
narcotics 
even after the state department was acknowledging there were 
problems with drug trafficking in association with contra 
activities on the southern front the justice department was 
adamantly denying that there was any substance to the narcotics 
allegations the report said 
at the time the fbi had significant information regarding the 
involvement of narcotics traffickers in contra operations and 
neutrality act violations 
summig up its findings the committee said foreign policy 
priorities towards the bahamas honduras nicaragua and panama at 
times delayed halted or interfered with us law enforcements 
efforts to keep narcotics out of the united states 
referring specifically to the contras the report said the 
logic of having drug money pay for the pressing needs of the 
contras appealed to a number of people who became involved in the 
covert war indeed senior us policymakers were not immune to 
the idea that drug money was a perfect solution to the contras 
funding problems

archbishop raymond hunthausen said that a 5year 
vatican review of the seattle roman catholic archdiocese did not 
lead to fundamental changes in its operations 
hunthausen who came under fire from catholic conservatives and 
at one time temporarily lost his authority over annulments and in 
several other church activities appeared with seattles coadjutor 
archbishop thomas murphy at a news conference wednesday 
a day earlier the popes us representative announced that an 
apostolic commission appointed to review hunthausens leadership 
had completed its work and would be dissolved 
were delighted were relieved were pleased hunthausen 
said were going to have a party 
im not sure the ministry has changed said hunthausen who 
added that the ministry was never in violation of romes teachings 
in the broad sense 
a statement issued by archbishop pio laghi in washington dc 
chief papal representative in the united states said hunthausen 
has indicated that he along with murphy will continue to 
address the issues which have been of concern to the church 
hunthausen 67 said after a trip to rome earlier this year that 
he had been assured the review had been completed and that the 
apostolic commission headed by cardinal joseph bernardin of 
chicago would be disbanded 
the commission which also included cardinal john oconnor of 
new york and archbishop john quinn of san francisco was set up in 
january 1987 to review hunthausens ministry 
after hunthausen came under fire from conservatives the vatican 
in 1985 removed his authority in five areas where he was accused of 
diverging from church teachings including ministry to homosexuals 
liturgical matters and marriage annulments an auxiliary bishop 
donald wuerl was appointed to take over those duties 
when that situation proved unworkable hunthausens authority 
was restored in early 1987 wuerl was relocated and murphy a 
bishop in montana was named coadjutor archbishop with right of 
succession 
the commission also was named to advise hunthausen and it met 
with him five times most recently in october 
margaret hoffman director of the sons of st peter coalition a 
conservative group critical of the archbishops leadership said 
liturgical abuses still occur in the archdiocese she cited 
hunthausen washing a womans feet last month in a holy week ritual 
reminiscent of jesus washing of the disciples feet

a drug derived from a chinese plant root 
selectively killed aidsvirus infected cells and inhibited virus 
reproduction in healthy cells during testtube experiments 
researchers announced today 
the scientists working for the university of california at san 
francisco and genelabs inc also have shown for the first time that 
macrophages cells that form the bodys first line of immune system 
defense can be reservoirs of infection with the human 
immunodeficiency virus which causes aids 
tests results from about two years of work were reported today 
in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences listed as a 
coauthor was hinwing yeung a scientist from chinese university 
of hong kong who first brought the chemical to the attention of 
researchers in san francisco 
the drug glq223 is a highly purified form of the plant protein 
trichosanthin which is found in the root of a chinese plant from 
the cucumber family 
the scientists cautioned that the drug has not been tried on 
people and that extensive studies will be required to determine 
whether it will be safe to administer to aids patients genelabs of 
redwood city calif has applied to the us food and drug 
administration for permission to begin human testing 
the drug has been tested in laboratory animals for toxicity 
said michael s mcgrath an assistant professor of medicine and 
director of the aidsimmunobiology research laboratory for san 
francisco general hospital the animal toxicity results were not 
published and the researchers said the drug had not yet been shown 
to kill the virus in the animals 
the scientists also said they did not know the exact mechanism 
by which trichosanthin killed hivinfected cells and inhibited hiv 
reproduction in test tubes 
after treating hivinfected blood samples from eight individuals 
with a single dose of the glq223 the scientists said they found no 
macrophages with evidence of virus production five days later the 
drug also inhibited replication of hiv in laboratory cultured 
cells the report said 
the study showed that 2 percent to 7 percent of macrophages in 
the blood of aids patients are infected with hiv microphages 
which are found in every organ of the body and are difficult to 
kill direct the bodys response to infection without functioning 
macrophages an individual is more likely to succumb to the 
diseases and infections that kill patients with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome

lawmakers clashed today over president bushs 
plan to sustain the nicaraguan contra rebels with 497 million in 
nonlethal aid with opponents charging the package hinges on 
winks nods and handshakes 
the house debated the compromise plan which would give the 
contras additional food clothing and medical assistance but would 
bar new money for weapons and ammunition to renew the battle 
against nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
congress was poised to approve the plan that was hammered out in 
weeks of negotiations between secretary of state james a baker iii 
and democratic leaders of the house and senate 
senate consideration of the plan was delayed today when 
republicans declined to say what amendments they planned according 
to senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine democrats 
planned no amendments to the agreement 
president bush telephoned me this morning urged me to move 
this legislation promptly and made clear his opposition to any 
amendments to the legislation mitchell said 
the majority leader called it ironic that members of bushs 
party were unwilling to go along with the agreement worked out by 
leaders 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan meanwhile said he 
would oppose all amendments in keeping with the compromise 
in the house republican leader bob michel of illinois urged 
support for the agreement telling his colleagues that what the 
agreement lacks in perfection it makes up in real effective help 
for the cause of progress and democracy in nicaragua and central 
america 
i wish we could do better but as legislators its not given to 
us to act only when conditions are perfect michel said 
rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committee said that with the agreement at last we have 
what is more than a narrowly based consensus 
but rep thomas foglietta dpa cited the democratic 
contention that continued support for the contras would derail the 
diplomatic peace process 
foglietta also said the plan would keep the contras in place and 
not integrate them into nicaraguan society 
this accord hinges on winks nods and handshakes he said 
id really like to say i trust this new administration the bush 
administration for reintegration of the contras but how can i 
when i read that thenvice president bush played a role in 
supplying covert aid to the contras 
on wednesday sen patrick leahy dvt said i think 
everybody whether they have supported or opposed the contras in 
the past knows that this is the end of the contra war its not 
going to start up again the contra war is over 
leahy commented shortly after the senate appropriations 
committee voted 182 to recommend the aid package be approved the 
house appropriations committee earlier voted 3410 to endorse the 
measure 
most of the emotional steam that marked nearly a decade of 
divisive congressional debate over contra aid was missing 
but sen ernest f hollings dsc a longtime contra aid 
supporter said the accord represents nothing more than a show of 
surrender leahy in turn characterized hollings comments as 
natural bitterness shared by many contra supporters 
leahy said the bush administration is to be commended for 
recognizing that former president reagans policy of arming the 
contras to serve as surrogates for the united states in nicaragua 
had failed 
on wednesday baker said approval of the bipartisan plan 
represents the only way to get the united states back into the 
ballgame in central america 
up to now we have been out of the ballgame because we had the 
legislature going in one direction and the executive going in 
another direction and we couldnt function baker told the senate 
appropriations foreign operations subcommittee today for the 
first time we have an opportunity to speak with one voice to the 
people of central america 
but baker said the plan also represents an acid test of whether 
the sandinistas will keep the promises made at the august 1987 
accord signed in guatemala city by five central american presidents 
it calls for free and fair elections in nicaragua and for 
democratic reforms including the removal of restrictions on the 
press and the release of political prisoners 
the aid plan also calls for spending an additional 42 million 
for medical assistance for civilian victims of the war in nicaragua 
and earmarks an additional 5 million for the agency for 
international development aid for operating expenses in conveying 
the new aid to the contras 
the plan also permits some of the aid money to be used for the 
voluntary reintegration of the contras into nicaraguan society or 
their relocation elsewhere in the region 
although the aid funds are to be approved through february of 
next year congress will be given an opportunity in november to 
review the situation and halt the aid if it sees fit

gov mike sullivan opened a threeday 
symposium on the future of yellowstone national park today by 
accusing the bush administration of feudalism for asking the 
state to pay for firefighting there 
i would hope that george bushs vision of a kinder and gentler 
nation does not envision burning someones back yard and then 
charging them for the privilege he said 
wildfires spurred by high heat and drought eventually burned 
across nearly half of the parks 22 million acres 
sullivan said cooperation among state and federal agencies in 
managing the worlds first national park is being sorely tested by 
bushs proposal to pay for last summers firefighting with the 
states share of federal mineral royalties money paid to the 
government for mining and oil drilling on federal land 
bluntly stated this idea is feudalism and not federalism 
western states are not vassals on some vast medieval estate owned 
by absentee landlords in washington but this proposal would treat 
us as such sullivan said 
the governor who is a democrat said he has urged that this 
illconceived idea be reconsidered 
the symposium featuring speakers from across the nation is to 
discuss various issues involving managing land and wildlife in the 
greater yellowstone area about 300 people attended the first 
morning of the conference which runs through saturday morning 
sullivan said management of the more than 12 million acres of 
federal land in and around yellowstone is complicated by a mix of 
land forms and controls including 85 federal laws and executive 
orders 
these mandates vary widely from the strict constraints in the 
wilderness acts to the more productionoriented multipleuse laws 
additionally nine major forest plans and park master plans guide 
the management of individual administrative units in the region 
he said 
part of the conferences mission is to discuss how management of 
the park can be coordinated better 
sullivan said he hoped participants would consider how to 
protect the economy of wyoming while protecting the future of the 
park 
the national parks and wilderness areas contribute 
significantly to the tourism industry becoming increasingly 
important to a state reeling from the impacts on energy and 
agriculture economies he said

jewish extremists taking the name of biblical 
assassins have stepped out of the shadows waging arson attacks on 
liberal jews and claiming the machine gun slaying of an arab 
experts say the acts reflect rightwing israeli frustrations 
over the armys inability to put down the palestinian uprising and 
may indicate the creation of a new jewish underground 
the group named after first century jewish zealots known as the 
sicarites claimed their first shooting attack monday when an 
israeli dressed in army fatigues opened fire with an uzi submachine 
gun on four arabs outside jerusalems walled old city 
khaled shawish a 26yearold blacksmith was killed and three 
other palestinians suffered moderate to serious wounds the gunman 
escaped 
a caller speaking hebrew with a french or north african accent 
claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the sicarites 
and said it was to avenge jewish victims of stoning attacks in the 
16month palestinian revolt 
a day later five bullets were left on the doorstep of a jewish 
woman from jerusalem known for her friendship with an arab family 
slogans said it was the work of the sicarites and threatened to 
harm her daughter if the woman did not end her contact with arabs 
the group has also taken responsibility for eight arson attacks 
since february on apartments or cars belonging to leftwing 
israelis there were no casualties 
the targeting of modernday jews sympathetic to palestinians 
echoes the activities of the ancient sicarites who used curved 
daggers called sica in latin to murder fellow jews accused of 
collaborating with the romans 
but although police described the initial arson attacks as 
amateur in execution they said the attack against the arabs 
represented a radical escalation in the sicarites method of 
operation 
indicating the seriousness with which police are treating the 
organizations claims a top police investigator district 
superintendent yehuda vilk has been appointed to the case 
vilk headed an investigation in february that uncovered the 
leaders of keshet a group of militant ultraorthodox jews who used 
bombs arson and grenades to enforce observance of religious laws 
on secular israelis 
police commissioner david krauss said the investigation is 
complicated by the fact that information on the group has been 
limited to its own telephoned claims of responsibility 
we know of the existence of this group only from telephone 
conversations in which they called themselves the sicarites 
krauss said its still early to say whether such an organization 
exists or who its members are 
the sicarites ideology as expressed in graffiti and telephone 
messages includes opposition to giving up any of the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip as well as any form of dialogue with 
palestinians 
even hardline prime minister yitzhak shamir who opposes any 
territorial compromise had been described in sicarite graffiti as 
a traitor who will return jewish land to arab hands 
ehud sprintzak a hebrew university political scientist and 
expert on jewish extremism said the group is most likely composed 
of a handful of religious fanatics who support the banned antiarab 
kach party led by brooklyn nyborn rabbi meir kahane 
kahane decribed mondays attack as a natural act of revenge by 
frustrated and angry jews he favors expelling all arabs from 
israel and the occupied territories which he insists israel should 
annex 
the ground is fertile for a group like this said sprintzak 
who warned sicarite activities could increase as feelings of 
powerlessness grew over israels inability to contain the 
palestinian uprising 
they realize the only thing that can prevent a peace process 
are provocations sprintzak said 
ariel merari a leading terrorism expert from tel aviv 
universitys jaffee center for strategic studies compared the 
sicarites to the jewish underground of the early 1980s 
the group carried out a series of attacks on palestinian targets 
between 1980 and 1984 including the maiming of two arab mayors and 
a shooting at hebrons islamic university that left three arabs 
dead and 30 wounded 
most of the 27 israelis convicted for their role in the attacks 
have since been freed after having their sentences reduced 
i think the time is right for this kind of group merari 
said of the sicarites the uprising has been going on for over a 
year and it is causing frustration and polarization among the 
jewish public

federal investigators have identified several 
passengers who may have unwittingly carried aboard the bomb that 
blew up pan am flight 103 over scotland on dec 21 a bush 
administration official said today 
cbstv news reported wednesday that suspicion for having planted 
the bomb was focused on a member of the popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command who is a relative of hafez 
dalkamoni who cbs said reportedly set up the network that carried 
out the attack 
an administration official knowledgeable about the investigation 
disputed the cbs account that investigators believe the passenger 
who unwittingly carried the bomb was khalid jaafar a young 
americanlebanese college student returning to michigan from 
frankfurt for the christmas holidays 
federal bureau of investigation agents have questioned jaafars 
parents at the familyrun gas station in detroit but the parents 
insist he was not involved 
the official said jaafar was only one of several passengers 
suspected of unwittingly bringing the explosive aboard and no 
one in the popular front is talking said the official who spoke 
on conditionof anonymity 
another government source said the chief theory of 
investigators is that the bombing was the work of the 
syriansponsored popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command 
investigators theorize that the terrorist group headed by ahmed 
jibril may have carried out the attack at the request of iran 
said the source who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
meanwhile the lord advocate of scotland lord fraser said in a 
statement in london that there has been a narrowing in the focus 
of the inquiry but it would be inadvisable for me to comment on 
these reports at this stage 
cbs said many of the leads in the case are coming from a member 
of the popular front for the liberation of palestine who is 
cooperating with investigators 
it said the popular front has its headquarters in syria but the 
investigation has uncovered evidence linking the pan am bombing to 
iran 
the london daily telegraph reported investigators have narrowed 
the number of people suspected of having been duped into carrying 
the bomb aboard to between three and five american passport holders 
who probably joined the flight in frankfurt 
it said fbi agents are searching european cities to find the 
terrorist who gave the passenger the radiocassette player in which 
investigators have confirmed the bomb was placed 
the pan am jumbo jet crashed in southern scotland killing all 
259 people aboard and 11 other people on the ground 
dalkamoni was in prison at the time of the bombing having been 
picked up last october following a raid on one of his safe houses 
along with weapons german police found three toshiba radio 
cassette players similar to the one used to blow up pan am 103 cbs

president bush will travel to a 
polishamerican community in michigan to announce economic aid 
measures aimed at demonstrating us gratitude for reform steps 
undertaken by the communist government in warsaw an administration 
source said today 
this official declining to be named publicly said bush will 
visit the detroit enclave of hamtramck which is roughly 60 percent 
polishamerican to outline the administrations plans on monday 
another official also speaking anonymously said consideration 
is being given to a trip by bush to poland although no time frame 
was suggested the option is still in abeyance the official 
said adding that no trip plans would be announced during mondays 
michigan appearance bush visited poland in september 1987 just 
days before formally announcing his presidential candidacy 
the warsaw government recently reached agreement with solidarity 
leader lech walesa to legalize the trade union movement that was 
outlawed during a martial law crackdown in 1981 and scheduled the 
first free elections in the country since the end of world war ii 
bush hailed the april 5 accord and administration officials had 
signaled in recent days that plans were afoot to reward the warsaw 
government with unspecified economic measures 
speculation has centered on granting poland trade advantages 
under the general system of preferences gsp and taking steps to 
encourage private investment in the eastern european nation through 
the overseas private investment corp 
a us aid package to economically beleaguered poland could 
include tariff exemptions under the gsp that would increase exports 
to the united states 
the trip monday would be bushs first visit to michigan since 
being elected president last november 
the president needed a backdrop to address the polishamerican 
community about the changes in poland hamtramck city council 
president paul odrobina told the detroit free press he said white 
house advance personnel told him that bush wants to make an 
announcement about the american governments policy toward poland 
in 1981 and 1982 the us government imposed economic sanctions 
against poland following the declaration of martial law and the 
outlawing of solidarity 
some sanctions were lifted in 1987 after the polish government 
moved toward a reconciliation with the union

the bombing of pan am flight 103 
will cost the airline about 50 million a company official said 
thursday 
that estimate includes the loss of the boeing 747 a drop in 
passenger traffic on some routes and the anticipated cost of 
lawsuits filed after the crash on dec 21 said peter t mchugh 
senior vice president for marketing for pan american world airways 
we dont have the exact figures yet but we expect that sum to 
be about 50 million mchugh told reporters 
bookings have rebounded somewhat however because of the 
eastern airlines strike which amounted to an increased earnings 
of 50 million he said 
mchugh said the losses from the bombing would not threaten the 
airline because pan am had a cash reserve fund of 285 million at 
the end of 1988 
according to mchugh the airline expects to spend about 15 
million this year to improve security plus an additional 6 
million for installation of more devices to detect plastic 
explosives 
british officials have traced the crash of flight 103 to what 
they believe was a radio cassette player packed with plastic 
explosives and an air pressuresensitive detonator the plane 
exploded as it flew over lockerbie scotland killing all 259 
aboard and 11 people on the ground 
pan am bookings decreased by 10 percent during the first quarter 
of this year because of the lockerbie crash said siegfried 
ruffert head of pan ams office in frankfurt

sugar ray robinson was 
poundforpound the worlds greatest boxer whose influence extended 
far beyond the rings he dominated for much of 25 years friends 
said after his death at age 67 
he was one of the finest human beings who ever lived even a 
better person than a prizefighter said sid lockitch robinsons 
business manager for 19 years 
he was charitable he cared very deeply for children 
lockitch said referring to the sugar ray youth foundation founded 
in 1969 in los angeles 
robinson whose 175196 record included 110 knockouts in his 
career died wednesday apparently of natural causes shortly after 
being taken to brotman memorial medical center 
his death was caused by heart disease said bob dambacher a 
spokesman for the los angeles county coroners office a 
postmortem examination also confirmed he suffered from alzheimers 
disease and diabetes 
boxings original sugar ray influenced fighters from muhammad 
ali to sugar ray leonard 
i idolized the man leonard said of robinson someone once 
said there was a comparison between sugar ray leonard and sugar ray 
robinson believe me theres no comparison sugar ray robinson was 
the greatest 
generations of fighters copied his style including muhammad 
ali said archie moore former light heavyweight champion and a 
friend for nearly 50 years ali got a lot of his style from 
robinson well all miss him i know ill miss him 
robinson fought his first fight oct 4 1940 and his last at 
age 44 on nov 10 1965 losing a 10round decision to joey archer 
in that span the flashy fighter was involved in some of the 
most memorable bouts 
and he was as flashy outside the ring as inside it he owned a 
harlem nightclub and drove a flamingopink cadillac on his boxing 
tours of europe during his peak his entourage included a valet a 
barber who doubled as his golf pro and several family members as 
well as his trainers 
money is for spending he once said 
robinson was born on may 3 1921 in detroit mich as walker 
smith jr 
as a teenage amateur boxer he borrowed the card of a young 
fighter named ray robinson once his sugar ray nickname stuck he 
never used his real name again 
he was elected to the boxing hall of fame in 1967 
sugar ray robinson was the man along with joe louis former 
heavyweight champion larry holmes those two guys opened the door 
for the rest of us 
anytime you get into a conversation about oldtime greats 
those are the two people everyone talks about 
even louis the renowned brown bomber and former heavyweight 
champion once called robinson the greatest fighter ever to step 
into the ring 
indeed robinson inspired the phrase pound for pound the 
best a description intended to transcend the weight divisions 
robinson won the vacant world welterweight title on dec 20 
1946 with a 15round decision over tommy bell and never lost a 
fight to a welterweight the rest of his career 
he also won the middleweight title stopping jake lamotta in the 
13th round on feb 14 1951 in chicago that was the sixth time 
the two fighters had met with robinson winning five it also was 
the only time they did not fight to the distance in one of the most 
brutal rivalries in boxing history 
by the time robinson met the raging bull for the last time 
he was almost 30 years old and his record already was 11912 yet 
he fought for another 14 years 
another of robinsons most memorable rivalries was against gene 
fullmer whom he had beaten only once in four meetings 
robinson lost the middleweight title to fullmer on jan 2 1957 
on a 15round decision then regained it on may 1 in chicago with 
one of the most famous onepunch knockouts in boxing history 
ending that fight in the fifth round 
he and fullmer fought to a draw on dec 3 1960 and he lost a 
15round decision to fullmer on march 4 1961 in las vegas 
besides his wife millie robinson is survived by a son from an 
earlier marriage ray jr two stepchildren ramona lewis and 
butch robinson four grandchildren and a sister evelyn nelson of

a church historian who for a quarter century has 
kept in firsthand touch with soviet religion says it is gaining 
stature and prerogatives never before deemed possible under 
communism 
the pace of change is really quite startling says the rev 
v bruce rigdon of grosse pointe mich one could have never 
predicted these changes would come so quickly 
rigdon a presbyterian and chairman of the national council of 
churches ussoviet church relations working group added in a 
telephone interview 
there is some evidence of something that is beginning to look 
like a religious revival occurring in many places in the soviet 
union especially among young people 
noting that several religious leaders were elected members of 
the new soviet parliament rigdon said 
this means that for the first time church leaders people who 
are not members of the communist party will participate in the new 
parliament its a new fact of life 
he said those elected include russian orthodox patriarch pimen 
metropolitan pitirim head of church publishing leningrad 
metroplitan alexei and armenian catholicos vaskin i 
the image of electing bishops and being represented by bishops 
in parliament is something nobody there had ever experienced before 
the freedom to choose rigdon said 
having led church delegations on visits there since 1961 most 
recently in february arranging a new extensive program of church 
cooperation between the two countries rigdon cited these other 
developments 
about 1000 new churches were opened in 1988 compared to 15 
in 1987 currently three to five additional churches are being 
opened daily with about 1500 expected to be opened in 1989 
seven new seminaries are planned for opening this fall 
besides the three already operating bringing the number to 10 
seminaries plus two advanced theological academies 
russian orthodoxy is acquiring its own printing press and 
facilities for producing films and records giving it unprecedented 
communications capabilities 
allowed by the government for the first time lay volunteers 
and clergy now visit hospitals and mental institutions to provide 
assistance and counseling encouragement 
churches hold catechism classes for teaching new members 
something not allowed before with some parishes now doing 
something very much like sunday school for the young also 
previously forbidden 
in every area soviet life is undergoing change but none is 
at a more remarkable pace than the changes in religious life 
rigdon said numbers of people now are coming to church for the 
first time 
the church which for so long had to concentrate on survival 
now faces a very difficult task the issue is whether it can 
communicate the gospel powerfully enough to people who have not 
heard it before to change their lives 
this is never easy for any church 
rigdon 53 veteran church historian at mccormick theological 
seminary and now pastor of grosse pointes memorial presbyterian 
church is among the most knowledgeable americans about soviet 
religious life 
over the last 28 years he has led about 70 visits there and is 
personally acquainted with soviet church leaders and pastors 
orthodox baptist roman catholic lutheran methodist pentecostal 
and jewish 
the change that the churches have experienced is part of a 
larger picture that is all utterly dependent on the continuation of 
policies of soviet leader gorbachev rigdon said 
in this sense americans should do everything possible to 
encourage stabilizing these processes it is clear that as the 
opposition to gorbachev gets larger there is a certain 
precariousness about it all 
he may have two or three years to strengthen the economy to 
get it producing needs in larger quantity and if he doesnt mr 
gorbachevs perestroika is in great trouble 
reformers are rare in russian history they dont last long 
we can hope hes an exception we should recognize the opportunity 
and give every sort of support possible to make sure that what 
grobachev represents succeeds 
in the february meeting the us and soviet church leaders 
noted that their first meetings began three decades ago at the 
height of the cold war and added in a joint statement 
the christians of our countries were actually the first people 
to melt the ice of mistrust between our two nations we are facing 
a new situation our societies are undergoing changes 
they pledged expanded cooperation including 
exchanges of theological students and professors contacts 
between congregations in sister cities joint publishing 
audiovisual and tv projects common efforts in emergencies and 
disarmament talks cooperation with third world partners joint 
youth conferences and work camps 
weve reached a new stage for the job rigdon said we 
agreed on 15 things we can do together over the next five years 
things that couldnt even have been discussed before

korea without government approval 
north korea has said relations would be harmed if south korea 
arrested moon who is an adviser to the united national democratic 
movement the largest dissident movement 
kims government already postponed a political meeting tuesday 
with south korea without giving a reason 
the south korean government of president roh taewoo has cracked 
down on dissidents arresting five leaders in the past week and is 
reassesing its policy toward the north officials in seoul have 
indicated they may delay all talks including a meeting on sports 
scheduled for tuesday

an attempt to undermine the seoul governments authority they

linking it to north korea which began a threeyear war in 1950 by 
invading south korea dissident leaders have defended the trip

who in turn bribed a navy engineer in order to help the firm obtain 
a 24 million contract to build handheld radar test equipment 
the defense argued the businessmen were unwillingly duped by 
private consultant william parkin who actually arranged for the 
scheme the defendants knew nothing about illegal efforts to obtain 
inside information on the contract that teledyne was awarded in 
july 1987 defense attorneys said 
the jury agreed with the government that kaub and sullivan had 
engaged in a consipracy with parkin and his associates all of whom 
pleaded guilty in advance of the trial before us district judge 
richard williams 
kaub and sullivan were each found guilty of one count of 
conspiracy in addition kaub was convicted on five counts of wire 
fraud while sullivan was convicted on three wire fraud counts 
those charges stem from the wiretapped conversations between the 
defendants and private consultants which were played for the jury 
and formed a central part of the governments evidence 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
kaub was also convicted of filing false statements charges that 
derived from papers he authorized to be sent to the defense 
department stating that teledyne had not used private consultants 
to work on the contract 
each of the counts carries a maximum penalty of five years in 
prison and 250000 in fines kaub faces a maximum sentence of 40 
years in jail and a maximum fine of 2 million sullivan 20 years 
and 1 million 
williams set sentencing for june 7 and allowed the defendants to 
remain free on bail 
parkin fred lackner and stuart berlin a navy official all 
pleaded guilty in the case before the federal trial began last 
week they cooperated with the government as did teledyne 
industries the parent of teledyne electronics teledyne entered a 
guilty plea in advance of the trial to counts of conspiracy and 
filing false statements 
assistant us attorney joseph aronica said he was pleased with 
the verdict and that it represented significant convictions he 
said the governments investigation into the pentagon procurement 
process is expanding and continuing 
attorneys for kaub and sullivan said they would appeal the 
guilty convictions

a new play inspired by the controversy over salman 
rushdies novel the satanic verses opens in london next week to 
counter what one of its two authors himself moslemborn refers to 
as a climate of fear 
iranian nights begins a 10day run on april 19 at the royal 
court theater it was written by howard brenton the leftwing 
english playwright and tariq ali an oxfordeducated pakistani 
who like rushdie was born a moslem 
ali said the threecharacter play inspired by the arabian 
nights stories aims to promote a fuller more educative 
vision of islam than the fanatical image conveyed by islamic 
fundamentalism 
it was written as a direct response to the plight of rushdie a 
naturalized british citizen born in india his novel the satanic 
verses has been widely condemned as blasphemous and it provoked 
a death threat against the author feb 14 from irans spiritual 
leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
my feeling is that if the play goes as successfully as i hope 
it will it will enable people to lose some of their fear said 
ali who believes reasoned discussion is still possible among 
moslems despite the extremist actions advocated by khomeini and his 
followers 
describing himself as a lapsed moslem ali said the aim 
of the play is to open up debate clear the air move forward with 
ease in examining the many facets of islam 
he also hopes the play will be seen in the united states and he 
said producer joseph papp has been informed about it 
iranian nights marks the playwriting debut of ali 45 a 
writer broadcaster and political analyst who emigrated to britain 
from lahore pakistan in 1963 brenton 46 cowrote with david 
hare the 1985 hit satire pravda his other plays include the 
romans in britain the churchill play and last years 
greenland 
their play will run for 10 performances prior to the theaters 
main production caryl churchills icecream 
but its debut follows some concern over subject matter that led 
to the resignation prior to rehearsals of two of its three actors 
a change of title and exhaustive board meetings at a theater that 
is no stranger to controversy 
roshan seth and art malik known in the united states from their 
performances in my beautiful laundrette and the jewel in the 
crown respectively pulled out of the production due to what 
theater publicists said were scheduling conflicts 
but ali said the actors had succumbed to pressure that appearing 
in the play was illadvised neither performer could be reached for 
comment the three roles are being played by nabil shaban paul 
bhattacharjee and fiona victory 
ali said the title provoked a slight dispute with the theater 
management who requested that its original name a mullahs 
night out be changed so it did not give offense a mullah is a 
moslem cleric 
i thought it was a very funny title which puts us firmly 
within the camp of a skeptical tradition of islam itself which is 
hostile to mullahs and the clergy ali said 
but the royal court came under severe attack two years ago for 
producing a play jim allens perdition which was accused of 
being antisemitic and it was clearly reluctant to enflame moslem 
opinion as it had earlier enflamed british jews 
londons islamic community had no reaction to reports of the 
plays debut 
we dont know what it iranian nights is all about nothing 
was sent to us said muhammed ebrahim executive secretary of the 
islamic council what we dont know we cannot be concerned with 
its ramadan and during that month were not interested in 
any other activity he added

president robert mugabe ordered a new 
judicial investigation into toplevel corruption thursday after a 
judge linked five cabinet ministers to a blackmarket racket on 
cars and trucks 
according to a report issued by judge president wilson sandura 
following a twomonth inquiry of six cabinet ministers only 
foreign minister nathan shamuyarira was cleared of wrongdoing 
sanduras threeman commission recommends the five be prosecuted 
for black marketeering it identifies them as defense minister 
enos nkala political affairs minister frederick shava higher 
education minister dzingai mutumbuka industry and technology 
minister callistus ndlovu and maurice nyagumbo the most senior 
minister accused and a staunch mugabe ally 
nyagumbo resigned just hours before the 121page report was 
published nkala and shava quit the government and sole legal 
political party last month after it was discovered they had lied 
to the commission 
the report also suggests mutumbuka and matabeleland north gov 
jacob mudenda be prosecuted for perjury 
its publication of abuses of power and privileges in the 
leadership has rocked this avowedly socialist government but also 
won mugabe praise for ordering some of his closest aides to face 
the embarrassment of being quizzed under the public spotlight 
mugabe is expected to announce major changes to his cabinet 
within the next few days his aides said on condition of anonymity 
sandura investigated charges that cabinet ministers and their 
friends bought cars and trucks at willowvale assembly plant at low 
fixed prices without having to wait they then resold them on the 
black market for up to five times what they paid 
ordinary zimbabweans frequently wait up to 10 years to buy a car 
because of a lack of hard currency 
mugabe on thursday ordered sandura to inquire into vehicle sales 
to officials at zimbabwes two other assembly plants 
lines of people gathered early thursday outside the government 
printing offices seeking copies of sanduras report but they were 
not available immediately 
during the proceedings spectators had crowded into the high 
court to jeer and boo many of the 60 witnesses reflecting mounting 
discontent with the people who have led the avowedly socialist 
government for the nine years since independence from britain

president bush said today americans should 
try to correct the ills of the nations schools by relying less on 
the taxpayers wallets and more on the collective will 
a nation that worships money or sees money as a cure for all 
that ails it is a society in peril bush told an educational 
conference here 
more spending isnt the only right answer or even the best 
answer he said what we need is better value for what we spend 
what we need is a shared determination on the part of 
every american to get involved with our schools bush added we 
must reestablish the value of teaching and learning in this 
country 
after abruptly scrapping a vacation in maine bush decided to go 
ahead with a trip to union high school here to drum up support for 
a 441 million education package intended to reward good teachers 
and schools 
the program has been sharply criticized by democrats as 
inadequate 
in his remarks bush called for partial deregulation of 
education saying we want to waive some regulations for poorer 
communities allowing them to pool state and federal funds in 
exchange for higher accountability and performance 
he did not elaborate but education secretary lauro cavazos told 
reporters on air force one en route here that the proposal was 
designed to get funds to local schools without a lot of 
paperwork 
cavazos said the proposal was not contained in the presidents 
education package last week but would become part of the 
administrations overall education program there are so many 
regulations and so much bureaucracy weve got to clear some of 
this away he said 
bush spoke of the work of volunteers in schools and said one 
need matches another and a wonderful thing happens you come up 
with an answer that money just cant buy 
thats one reason we need to rely less on the collective 
wallet and more on our collective will the president said 
bush told the educators that children always have been taught 
about the exploration of new frontiers such as the first trips 
across the ocean the move west across america and journeys into 
space 
but we must now draw the attention of a new generation to a 
larger almost limitless horizon the frontier of the mind he 
said 
our goal for education must be as ambitious as its been for 
the west or for space exploration or for any other american 
frontier 
thousands of flagwaving children lined the streets of this 
residential community to cheer the president as his limousine 
passed by 
bush stopped his motorcade briefly at hamilton school to meet 
gina marie sisco a sixthgrade pupil who had written him last week 
to complain that she was not among those students who would get a 
chance to meet him 
in her letter gina said the students selected to see bush were 
chosen on the basis of winning the presidents academic fitness 
award i am proud of them but i feel its unfair to show you just 
the smart kids she wrote 
after greeting the girl bush shook hands for four minutes with 
school children before traveling on to his speech 
todays stop in union was supposed to have been the jumpingoff 
point for a threeday trip to bushs seaside home in kennebunkport 
maine 
however the vacation segment was canceled wednesday when bush 
decided to remain in washington during a visit by his son jeb and 
his wife columba who are in town from florida 
basically they just didnt want to go said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater presidents have the right to do 
that 
fitzwater said cancellation of the trip also meant bush would be 
on hand in case white house and congressional negotiators reached 
agreement on a budget and deficitreduction package 
bushs education proposal calls for cash rewards for successful 
schools and good teachers scholarship funds for students gifted in 
science and math financial grants to encourage magnet schools 
offering specialized educational programs and special aid for urban 
school districts with severe drug problems 
it also would provide funds allowing states to set up programs 
using teachers who lack standard education courses and other 
certification requirements 
todays trip came on the heels of a speech and 
questionandanswer session by bush on wednesday before the 
convention of the american society of newspaper editors where he 
outlined a series of steps to tighten ethical rules for congress 
judges and the executive branch 
proposing a major change in the way congressional races are 
financed bush called for a ban on campaign contributions by 
political action committees in last years congressional races 
pacs spent more than 151 million directly on house and senate 
candidates democrats received the lions share of that money 99 
million 
responding to questions on other issues bush said for the first 
time the federal government may have been too slow in taking a 
major role in cleaning up the alaska oil spill 
maybe i should accept some criticism for not acting a week 
sooner said bush who last friday put the government in virtual 
control of the cleanup operation and authorized federal troops to 
help out 
on the other hand he said the federal overnment moved much 
more quickly and more boldly than it gets credit for 
bush rejected suggestions that the spill should derail 
administration hopes of oil and gas exploration in environmentally 
sensitive areas 
i simply do not want this disaster to weaken the national 
security interest by making us further and further dependent on 
foreign oil he said were about up to 50 percent now and that 
is not a good enough standard 
he was asked if he would give a full accounting of his role in 
the reagan administrations secret supply effort for the nicaraguan 
contras once the trial of former white house aide oliver north is 
concluded 
i think ive given a full accounting bush responded 
referring to stories coming out of the north trial bush said i 
dont like reading charges that i happen to feel are untrue but i 
have to stand on that and that just goes with the territory

president bush will reward the communist 
government of poland for newly instituted reform measures 
including its commitment to hold free elections for the first time 
since 1946 an administration source said thursday 
bush has chosen the detroit polishamerican enclave of hamtramck 
as the setting to announce a series of measures aimed at 
stimulating polands beleaguered economy said the source who 
spoke on the grounds of anonymity 
this official also indicated that consideration was still being 
given to a bush trip to the eastern european nation although no 
general time frame has been established 
bush as vice president visited poland during a ninenation 
european tour in september 1987 meeting with solidarity leader 
lech walesa and leaders of the communist government just before 
formally launching his campaign for the presidency 
the bush administration on april 5 hailed the agreement to 
reinstate the solidarity trade union movement as a legal force in 
polish society and its companion agreement to free elections in 
june for a twohouse parliament in which some seats will be set 
aside for solidarity representatives 
walesa whose solidarity organization helped force the 
government to adopt sweeping democratic reforms said thursday 
that his supporters want him to run for the newly created post of 
president 
in a telephone interview from his home in gdansk walesa said he 
would not run in june for a seat in the newly created senate but 
he said he may not refuse if a member of the existing sejm or the 
new senate nominates him when the two houses of parliament meet 
later this year to elect a new president 
if that doesnt happen walesa said he will probably run in the 
next presidential election scheduled six years from now 
the white house hailed the april 5 accord as a historic step 
that would improve polishamerican relations 
speculation on new us economic aid for poland has centered on 
granting the warsaw government trade advantages under the general 
system of preferences gsp and steps to encourage private 
investment in the eastern european nation through the overseas 
private investment corp 
in 1981 and 1982 the us government imposed economic sanctions 
against poland following the declaration of martial law and the 
outlawing of the solidarity trade union movement some sanctions 
were lifted in 1987 after the polish government moved toward a 
reconciliation with the union the united states however has 
continued to pressure western banks and governments against 
extending credits to warsaw 
a polish government spokesman said last week that it was asking 
the united states to give the green light to loans from the 
international monetary fund the world bank and western governments 
what we want does not lie in the bilateral range of things 
not trade said polish embassy spokesman mierik miernik 
polands efforts to rebuild its shattered economy have been 
hampered by an inflation rate running from 60 percent to 100 
percent and by a 39 billion foreign debt the polish government 
would like us support in persuading bankers and governments to 
reschedule repayment of the loans miernik said

abbie hoffman the 1960s radical who 
inspired one generation and outraged another in the troubled days 
of protest and yippie pranks has died at his home 
he was 52 
hoffman who was a defendant at the chicago seven antiwar 
conspiracy trial and wrote books such as revolution for the hell 
of it and steal this book was found dead in his home 
wednesday evening said solebury township police chief richard 
mangan 
he was fully dressed and under the covers of his bed 
michael waldron hoffmans landlord and neighbor found him and 
told police hoffman had been depressed about an auto accident in 
which he suffered a broken leg last june 
but mangan said no evidence suggested suicide an autopsy is 
planned for this afternoon or tonight the coroners office said 
waldron said he went to the twobedroom apartment after a friend 
of hoffmans joanna lawrenson asked him to check because she had 
not been able to contact hoffman by telephone 
he said he looked trough a bedroom window and saw hoffman in 
bed but he couldnt wake him by tapping on the window i went 
back to my house and got my key and opened the door and found him 
dead in bed looking peaceful and comfortable waldron said 
hoffmans death shocked those who knew him 
oh god im stunned he was brilliant dr timothy leary 
said the lsd guru then added he needed time to collect his 
thoughts before he could comment further 
abbie hoffman was an american legend leary said later 
gerald b lefcourt hoffmans longtime attorney remembered him 
as a humorous man devoted to correcting what was wrong with society 
he threw money on the american stock exchange floor in the 
late 60s and was able to show in that satirical event when 
hundreds of people on the stock exchange on wall street chased 
flying money on the floor how silly it all was lefcourt said 
from his new york city home 
its the end of an era said hoffmans 49yearold brother 
jack from his framingham mass home 
he was 52 years old and i think he gave up maybe he was 
tired i know he was disappointed in the young people of today he 
didnt feel he was getting through to them he was disenchanted 
just last week hoffman who criticized college campuses in 
recent years as bastions of rest told a vanderbilt university 
audience that he was saddened by the interest todays young people 
have in the 1960s 
nostalgia is a sign of middleage he told them during an 
appearance with leary were reminiscing about our youth when 
you see young people nostalgic for a youth they didnt even 
experience its a little sad theyre supposed to be out making 
one for themselves 
hoffman was writing a book when he died said his publisher 
john oakes 
he was somebody who stayed true to what he believed in unlike 
so many of his contemporaries who sold out and became just what 
they detested when they were 20 years old said oakes 
a native of worcester mass hoffman rose to prominence with 
the chicago seven a group of radicals who stood trial on charges 
of conspiring to disrupt the bloody 1968 democratic national 
convention in chicago 
the others were tom hayden jerry rubin david dellinger 
reynard c davis lee weiner and john froines 
the 4monthlong federal trials theatrics featured wildhaired 
defendants and a 74yearold judge julius hoffman who ordered 
bobby seale a former black panther leader bound and gagged in the 
courtroom seales trial later was severed from the others 
hoffman and four others also were charged with crossing state 
lines with intent to riot they were acquitted of conspiracy but 
convicted of the second charge the convictions eventually were 
overturned 
during a reunion of the chicago seven last year hoffman 
characterized himself as an american dissident 
i dont think my goals have changed since i was 4 and i fought 
schoolyard bullies said hoffman 
two years ago he was arrested for the 42nd time while 
protesting cia recruitment at the university of massachusetts 
hoffman amy carter daughter of former president carter and 13 
others eventually were acquitted of trespassing and disorderly 
conduct 
hoffman whose given name was abbott was born nov 30 1936 
his activist roots can be traced to worcester where in the 
early 60s he was a chairman of the friends of the student 
nonviolent coordinating committee and vice chairman of the congress 
of racial equality 
he started the loosely organized yippie movement or youth 
international party in 1968 to bring together radicals to protest 
the government and the vietnam war 
hoffman went underground in 1974 to avoid trial on cocaine 
possession charges he emerged nearly seven years later and 
revealed he had lived in upstate new york and had undergone plastic 
surgery 
he moved to this philadelphia suburb several years ago during 
the height of a losing battle furor via the airwaves and the host of the 
conference here 
a good many people who listen to talk radio feel frustrated 
that they never knew what to do in responding to issues williams 
said in a recent interview we just lead them down the path 
telling them here are the principles 
beginning june 9 williams will have most of the visiting talk 
show hosts on his afternoon program among those expected to attend 
are michael siegel of king in seattle roy fox of kfyi in phoenix 
tom leykis of kfi in los angeles al rantel of wnws in miami and 
former philadelphia mayor frank rizzo now a talk show host on wcau 
in philadelphia 
radio hosts have long used the airwaves to stir up interest in 
local issues but last february they took the technique nationwide 
led by talk show hosts listeners flooded congress with a 
torrent of tea bags bearing the message read my tea bag no 50 
percent raise the public pressure helped quash a salary hike for 
congressmen judges and others on the federal payroll 
now siegel in seattle is trying to generate national interest 
in a campaign to boycott exxon to protest its response to the exxon 
valdez oil spill he has been interviewed on other radio stations 
around the country and says he is receiving 200 letters a day many 
containing demolished exxon credit cards 
the entertainment media has gone far in the past year with the 
radio talk show host the 1988 film talk radio depicted a 
badgering texas talk show host and the televsion series midnight 
caller features on an excop who uses the airwaves to fight crime 
the talk show hosts have loosely formed a federation but as 
yet it has no name williams is considering vox pop short for 
the latin phrase vox populi or voice of the people 
williams and other radio hosts say they are lobbyists for their 
listeners 
but others see them as demagogues who gloss over the 
complexities of issues and sell a largely conservative brand of 
conventional wisdom to their audiences 
rep vic fazio dcalif a supporter of the payraise bill 
spoke out against the radiodriven pressure against the measure 
we became cartoon cannon fodder for trash televison and for talk 
radio fazio said from the house floor we fell prey to the 
deception of the rabble rousers 
im a little bit concerned that the local disc jockeys and 
talk show hosts are using serious national issues for 
audiencebuilding said james h quello a member of the federal 
communications commission some of them remind me of college 
sophomores at a rally 
for sophomores the radio hosts make good money a host in a 
major market can easily make more than 100000 a year and 
sometimes much more according to phoenix radio host barry young 
and they can be worth that to their stations in a random 
sampling talk shows on three am stations rated by the arbitron co 
all increased their market share by last fall compared to the 
previous year in less than a year in 1988 the jerry williams show 
went from a 79 percent share to a 93 percent share 
murry levin a political science professor at boston university 
and author of talk radio and the american dream listened to 
700 hours of local talk radio programing and is convinced of its 
power 
talk radio he said is the only medium that provides an 
outlet for workingclass people 
siegel despite his success in getting support on the oil spill 
issue says the audience not the host sets the agenda we dont 
have control over these people

retail sales edged up a meager 01 percent 
last month after dropping sharply in february the government said 
thursday in a report analysts cited as evidence that cautious 
consumer spending is moderating economic growth 
sales totaled a seasonally adjusted 13942 billion last month 
held back by sluggish business at department stores and auto 
dealerships the commerce department reported sales had plunged 
06 percent in february 
the weak figures for the past two months are consistent with a 
series of recent government reports that suggest slower economic 
growth lies ahead as the record peacetime expansion stretches into 
its seventh year 
i dont think we are going to see a big slowdown or a caving 
in but there is definitely a softer tone to growth and it is being 
driven by softer consumer spending said economist allen sinai of 
the boston co 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the retail 
sales figures provide further evidence of a pattern of slower 
consumer spending in recent months we continue to believe the 
economy is sound showing steady growth with low inflation 
for the third straight month overall sales in march were held 
down by a decline in spending on autos which account for almost 
onefourth of the retail total 
automotive sales edged down 01 percent in march after declining 
25 percent in february and 19 percent in january it was the 
first time auto sales have dropped for three straight months in 
nearly five years 
carmakers in recent weeks have launched a new round of incentive 
programs in hopes of luring customers back to showrooms during the 
prime spring selling season despite higher interest rates for loans 
excluding the automotive category retail sales last month still 
were up just 02 percent for march after holding virtually even 
during february 
retail sales account for about onethird of overall economic 
activity and are closely watched as a measure of the economys 
health 
analysts said the weakness in retail spending has occurred even 
though consumer confidence remains high and income growth has been 
strong and appears to reflect the effects of higher interest 
rates rising inflation and a tapering off of demand after years of 
heavy spending 
people are probably just taking a deep breath and stepping 
back a bit said economist lea tyler of the wefa group in bala 
cynwyd pa i would interpret it as a bit of belttightening on 
the part of the consumers 
many analysts expect the economy to lose steam this year in 
response to a campaign by the federal reserve board to push up 
interest rates and thus dampen demand and restrain inflation some 
economists have expressed concern that the feds campaign could 
unintentionally tip the country into a recession 
ms tyler said that based on recent reports showing weakness in 
consumer spending and other sectors of the economy the risk of a 
recession arriving some time in the latter half of this year or 
early next year has risen 
however she said the economy is more likely to experience 
slower growth and skirt a recession without actually dipping into 
one 
in the key category of department and other general merchandise 
stores sales fell 12 percent in march to 156 billion after 
declining 15 percent in february 
sales of durable goods big ticket items expected to last 
three or more years were down 02 percent last month after 
plunging 17 percent in february sales of nondurable goods 
meanwhile rose 03 percent in march after climbing 02 percent 
during the previous month 
among the categories of goods to report sales increases last 
month were food and grocery stores up 02 percent gasoline 
service stations up 05 percent and bars and restaurants up 05 
percent 
categories posting declines included building and hardware 
stores down 19 percent furniture stores down 02 percent 
clothing and accessory stores down 04 percent and drug stores 
down 02 percent

the codeveloper of a university of utah cold 
fusion experiment submitted to intense scrutiny by his peers and 
concluded he was certain it was a way to tap the energy of the 
stars 
chemist b stanley pons told 7000 people attending a meeting of 
the american chemical society on wednesday that an experiment 
conducted at room temperature produced energy from nuclear fusion 
but that exactly how it works on a molecular level is still not 
clear 
its absolutely sure in my mind that what weve seen is 
nuclear fusion said pons we cannot explain the data in any 
other way 
pons received longdistance support just as the discussions 
began scientists in the soviet union announced they had duplicated 
the utah experiment and the massachusetts institute of technology 
said it had applied for patents involving cold nuclear fusion 
today two graduate students at the university of washington said 
they also had partially duplicated the utah work 
but a physicist and other experts who sat beside pons during a 
panel discussion said they remained unconvinced that the utah 
experiment was fusion 
harold p furth director of the princeton university plasma 
physics laboratory said with barely contained contempt that 
worldclass physicists will not take the utah findings seriously 
until the precise process involved is explained and demonstrated 
with control experiments 
furth said that some experts believe the energy detected in the 
utah experiment is actually a chemical reaction that is not 
understood 
another panel member university of texas chemist allen j bard 
said he had an open mind on the experiment but added it is 
unprecedented to see chemical reactions produce nuclear reactions 
the verdict is still out 
two weeks ago pons and coinvestigator martin fleischmann of 
the university of southampton in britain announced they had 
achieved fusion using ordinary laboratory equipment at room 
temperature 
the announcement stunned and confused researchers around the 
world some of whom have spent more than 25 years and millions of 
dollars trying to develop controlled nuclear fusion 
pons and fleischmann said their experiment used a rod of 
palladium and a coil of platinum immersed in a beaker of heavy 
water in which ordinary hydrogen atoms are replaced by 
deuterium a heavier isotope of hydrogen when electricity was 
applied to the coil for about 100 hours it forced deuterium atoms 
into the palladium until the atoms fused producing energy in the 
form of heat pons said 
he said the device made four watts of energy for every watt used 
pons said he is enlarging the experiment and if the process 
still works then cold fusion may provide a dramatic new energy 
source 
pons admitted he was not sure how the experiment causes fusion 
and exactly what role each of the chemicals play in producing 
energy 
furth said physicists will not take the work seriously until a 
control experiment is conducted using ordinary water instead of 
deuterium oxide also called heavy water 
pons announced earlier that he conducted such an experiment with 
ordinary water and it did not produce the radiation or energy 
effects 
in italy meanwhile fleischmann presented more details of the 
experiment at an international conference in erice sicily but 
many scientists there said they were skeptical 
im warning people dont sell your oil well yet said 
physicist steven jones of brigham young university in utah 
fusion the energy process that fuels the sun the stars and the 
hydrogen bomb holds promise of becoming the ultimate energy source 
the fusion of atoms in only 1250th of an ounce of deuterium 
would give an energy equivalent of 300 gallons of gasoline and 
deuterium can be extracted from the oceans for only pennies per 
gallon of seawater 
furthermore fusion fires burn without the pollution produced 
from fossil fuels and fusion creates hundreds of times less 
radioactive waste than do atomsplitting nuclear power plants 
elsewhere the soviet news agency tass reported that soviet 
scientists duplicated the utah experiment and reported achieving 
nuclear fusion at room temperature the soviet scientists planned 
more research on cold fusion tass said 
mit said it has applied for patents involving cold nuclear 
fusion based on the theoretical work of peter l hagelstein a 
university researcher who a decade ago pioneered what eventually 
became the worlds first xray laser 
mit today refused to disclose any details of hagelsteins theory 
or the technology he devised hagelsteins process is yet to be 
tested in a laboratory said mit spokesman eugene mallove 
the disclosure comes less than a week after other mit scientists 
said they were unable to duplicate the utah experiment and raised 
doubts about the utah claims mallove said today those other mit 
experiments independent of hagelsteins work were continuing 
today two university of washington researchers said they 
detected indications of cold fusion in an experiment they conducted 
with heavy water and did not get the same results using a control 
experiment with ordinary water 
they said that in their experiment a mass spectrometer detected 
a possible indicator of tritium a radioactive isotope of hydrogen 
commonly produced in fusion reactions 
earlier this week scientists from texas aampm and georgia tech 
announced that they had achieved a reaction using equipment modeled 
on the utah experiment

two university of washington researchers detected 
indications of cold fusion in an experiment they conducted with 
heavy water but could not get the same results using a control 
experiment with ordinary water the researchers said today 
graduate students van l eden and wei liu said they did not 
duplicate exactly a highly publicized experiment by university of 
utah chemist b stanley pons and martin fleischmann of the 
university of southampton england pons and fleischmann said they 
apparently produced nuclear fusion in a tabletop experiment using 
ordinary lab equipment 
but eden and liu said they did get indications that fusion may 
have taken place in their experiment last week 
eden said that in their experiement a mass spectrometer 
detected a possible indicator of tritium a radioactive isotope of 
hydrogen commonly produced in fusion reactions 
the indicator was found when the experiment was run using 
deuterium a hydrogen isotope found in seawater and known as 
heavy water eden said the indicator was not detected when the 
test was repeated with ordinary water 
both researchers who specialize in molecular studies cautioned 
the results were preliminary and needed review by other scientists 
they also said they had not ruled out any other explanations for 
what they observed 
they said scientists expect a fusion reaction to produce 
substantial quantities of neutrons but they did not detect any 
although they were not using a particularly sensitive detector for 
them 
the pair used a test tube containing deuterium oxide in which a 
palladium electrode and gold wire were placed and connected to a 
power source the palladium electrode actually a hollow rod with 
one end sealed was connected to a vacuum chamber which in turn 
was connected to the mass spectrometer which detects indications 
of nuclear particles 
two weeks ago pons and fleischmann announced they had achieved 
fusion at room temperature using ordinary laboratory equipment 
the announcement stunned and confused researchers around the 
world some of whom have spent more than 25 years and millions of 
dollars trying to develop controlled nuclear fusion 
pons and fleischmann said their experiment used a rod of 
palladium and a coil of platinum immersed in a beaker of heavy 
water water made with deuterium an isotope of hydrogen when 
electricity was applied to the coil for about 100 hours it forced 
deuterium atoms into the palladium until the atoms fused producing 
energy in the form of heat pons said 
harold furth director of plasma physics at princeton 
university appeared with pons on wednesday at a meeting of the 
american chemical society in dallas 
furth said top physicists will not take the utah findings 
seriously until the precise process involved is explained and 
demonstrated with control experiments and some experts believe the 
energy detected in the utah experiment is actually a chemical 
reaction that is not understood 
but furth said that if the experiment worked using heavy water 
but not ordinary water it would suggest the reaction actually did 
involve some sort of deuterium fusion 
pons admitted he was not sure how the experiment causes fusion 
and exactly what role each of the chemicals play in producing 
energy 
fusion the energy process that powers the sun the stars and 
the hydrogen bomb holds promise of becoming the ultimate energy 
source 
the fusion of atoms in only 1250th of an ounce of deuterium 
would give an energy equivalent of 300 gallons of gasoline and 
deuterium can be extracted from the oceans for only pennies per 
gallon of seawater

edith eger relied on humor to survive 
auschwitz mineko lewis used physical activity to make it through 
us internment of japaneseamericans during world war ii porter 
halyburton helped fred cherry survive in a tiny cell of a north 
vietnamese prison 
the four spoke wednesday at a conference on the trauma suffered 
by captives of all kinds organizers said they hoped to heighten 
awareness among academics and caregivers of the lingering 
psychological effects 
ms lewis 61 who teaches english at the university of 
tennessee told nearly 200 people during a panel discussion she 
cant watch documentaries with film footage of elderly japanese 
being interned on the west coast during the war 
the old people just gave up afterward they didnt know what 
to do they died physically and spiritually said ms lewis a 
teenager at the time who had never before spoken publicly about 
her experience in an internment camp 
ms eger 61 a san diego psychotherapist said she and other 
holocaust survivors werent equipped to handle freedom 
when we were finally liberated the gate was opened and we 
didnt know what to do she said we craved freedom but we 
didnt know how to take responsibility for our lives 
ms eger was 16 when she was sent to auschwitz her recovery was 
slow it took me 30 years just to even utter and speak the 
unspeakable ms eger said 
ms eger recalled how as a ballet student she danced for 
joseph mengele nicknamed the angel of death and how she joked 
with one of her captors when he regularly drew her blood for 
transfusions 
i bet him my blood youre never going to win the war said 
ms eger a native of hungary thats where humor came in humor 
was the best tranquilizer 
cherry 61 and halyburton were fighter pilots who were shot 
down halyburton was in the navy cherry the air force cherry a 
poor rural black from suffolk va and halyburton a middleclass 
white from davidson nc were thrust together with their captors 
hope that their backgrounds would create racial friction 
the strategy backfired and the two quickly became lifelong 
friends 
i first perceived him as a plant for intelligencegathering 
purposes cherry said i thought he was a trained spy we 
played cat and mouse for a very short while 
the night halyburton was thrown into his cell cherry was 
suffering a dislocated shoulder and a broken foot along with the 
starvation and depression both suffered 
the north vietnamese eventually performed surgery on his 
shoulder but he was worse off with infection afterward 
i was very ill i was literally rotting under the cast haly 
was stuck with me said cherry now a computer marketing 
executive in silver spring md he hd to do everything for me he 
offered me his food handfed me bathed me 
halyburton now 48 and a professor at the naval war academy in 
newport ri was far from the racist his captors thought he would 
be 
all they knew was i was a southerner it didnt take us long 
to realize who we were he said of his friend i dont think 
id ever been happier to see anybody in my life

a powerful concentration of hydrogen peroxide 
being promoted as a treatment for aids and cancer has caused the 
death of a texas child who mistook the chemical for water the food 
and drug administration said thursday 
the fda said the death occurred in conroe texas last september 
when a mother took what she thought was a bottle of water from her 
refrigerator and poured drinks for her two children and the child 
of a neighbor 
the neighbors child died and the two others were severely 
injured 
the fda announcement also said that two brothers in dennison 
texas were hospitalized after a similar incident the fda did not 
reveal the names of those injured or killed 
a product sold as 35 percent food grade hydrogen peroxide to 
be used in what is called hyperoxygenation therapy for aids 
cancer and more than 60 other conditions was blamed for the death 
and injuries the fda said 
the agency said the peroxide solution is highly corrosive and is 
considered dangerous the peroxide concentration is about 10 times 
stronger than the 3 percent solution commonly used to disinfect 
minor cuts 
this concentration is not approved by the fda for any 
therapeutic purpose said fda commissioner frank e young no 
one has come forward with any evidence this substance taken 
internally has any medical value buyers are being cheated and 
subjected to significant risks and family members are being 
injured 
the fda said the concentrated hydrogen peroxide is purchased 
from chemical plants in texas and mexico repackaged in smaller 
containers and then sold under such labels as biowater and 
h202 
literature accompanying the product explains how to dilute the 
peroxide and claims that it can be used for sprouting seeds 
purifying meat and for treatment of acne gum disease athletes 
foot colic headache varicose veins acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome and cancer 
use of the product is promoted as an alternative medicine by 
mailorder distributors in texas wisconsin minnesota and 
california and by some health food outlets the fda said it is 
sold in pint quart and gallon containers some with 
childresistant caps 
the fda said material distributed with the peroxide includes 
fictitious medical claims and claims that the benefits of the 
chemical are being suppressed by the government and the medical 
establishment 
federal officials have attempted to block promotion of the 
chemical as a home remedy since 1985 but it has continued the fda 
announcement said

an attorney for the rock band judas priest is 
seeking dismissal of a lawsuit that claims the british groups 
heavy metal music led two youths into a suicide pact 
suellen fulstone of reno said in a motion filed wednesday that 
the band could be held liable in the case only if the courts 
created a dangerous exception to first amendment rights for 
subliminal messages 
the implications of any such exception are altogether 
frigid she said the very fact of this lawsuit has had an 
improperly inhibiting effect on creative work it should be the 
last of its kind 
ms fulstone argued in the washoe district court motion that 
words that are heard subconsciously should have the same 
constitutional protection as any other printed or spoken words 
a lawsuit against judas priest and cbs records claims that the 
words and subliminal messages on the bands stained class album 
motivated james vance and raymond belknap of sparks to attempt 
suicide in 1985 belknap shot himself to death but when vance 
fired the shotgun slipped and ripped his face apart he died in

a car bomb exploded near a shopping 
arcade in a northeastern town thursday killing at least 38 people 
the military blamed tamil extremists for the blast that broke a 
truce 
angry sinhalese in the port of trincomalee retaliated by 
stabbing a tamil to death and wounding seven others residents 
said the mob also set ablaze a shop owned by a tamil 
a spokesman for the most militant tamil rebel group the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam denied it planted the bomb 
twentyfour of the men and women who died in the blast were 
sinhalese a military official said the other victims were tamils 
and moslems said the official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
the boobytrapped car was parked outside a hotel and shopping 
arcade it detonated as more than 100 sinhalese hunted for gifts 
and sweets to celebrate their new year on thursday said a 
spokeswoman for the indian high commission embassy 
the blast destroyed the hotel and flattened four neighboring 
shops in trincomalee which is 147 miles northeast of colombo 
indian peacekeeping troops imposed an unofficial curfew and were 
patrolling the town the indian spokeswoman said 
india deployed troops here in 1987 to disarm tamil militants 
under a peace accord to end the sixyear tamil separatist campaign 
that has claimed 12500 lives 
new delhi became involved because its own 60 million tamils 
sympathize with the rebel cause tamils in sri lanka claim the 
majority sinhalese discriminate against them in jobs and education 
leftwing sinhalese extremists have reacted violently to the 
peace accord saying it makes too many concessions by allowing 
limited autonomy for the tamil minority 
tamil rebels also reject the accord saying it does not meet 
their demands for selfrule 
the latest violence came on the second day of a weeklong 
ceasefire offered by president ranasinghe premadasa to tamil and 
sinhalese extremists the peace package included a general amnesty 
seats in parliament and jobs for militants 
tamils comprise 18 percent of the islands 16 million people 
sinhalese are 75 percent of the population and control the

oliver north wrapped up six tough days on the 
witness stand today with a final declaration of his innocence of 
charges stemming from the irancontra affair 
the former white house aide said he felt he was tabbed by reagan 
administration officials to be the fall guy in the affair when he 
heard himself described at a white house news conference in 
november 1986 as the only one who knew what was going on 
he also said he told the truth to thenattorney general edwin 
meese iii who had been assigned by president reagan to conduct an 
inquiry into the sale of arms to iran meeses aides uncovered the 
diversion of proceeds to the contra during the inquiry 
norths defense case was concluded shortly after he left the 
witness stand us district judge gerhard gesell said he hoped 
final arguments would begin on monday 
north was questioned closely during the day over details of the 
governments charges against him 
he testified that he used catalog store typewriters to write 
backdated letters claiming that he had offered to pay for a 
13800 home security system that he had actually had accepted free 
of charge 
on his sixth and final day of testimony at his trial north said 
he typed the letters in december 1986 after he had been fired from 
the national security council staff because of the irancontra 
affair 
still in the marine corps after being dismissed from the nsc 
north said he didnt want to type the backdated letters at work 
because he didnt want the marines involved in that type of 
coverup 
now accused of accepting an illegal gratuity north said he went 
to a catalog outlet on two occasions using typewriters there to 
create two backdated letters the documents were a phony offer to 
pay by saying the system was on loan until north left the 
government and that the installer could use his home as a promotion 
for his business 
north had accepted the security system in mid1986 from retired 
air force maj gen richard secord who north had enlisted to 
secretly run arms to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
north also testified that he assumed a coverup was in place when 
meese announced on nov 25 1986 that north was the pivotal figure 
in diverting money to the contras 
ending four days of grueling crossexamination north said meese 
gave reporters details of the arms shipments and diversion that 
were inconsistent with what i had told the attorney general two 
days before 
at the news conference meese said norths boss thennational 
security adviser john poindexter had known of the diversion but 
hadnt approved it 
in fact poindexter has said he approved the diversion 
this was part of pointing the finger at ollie north as a 
coverup and that is the way it was supposed to be the former 
nsc aide testified president reagan announced norths firing from 
the white house staff at the news conference 
north denied that he lied to meeses aides as the irancontra 
affair was unfolding saying that by golly when they raised 
the diversion of money to the nicaraguan rebels i told them about 
it 
north said he was unable to recall many details of the nov 23 
1986 interview which is memorialized only in handwritten notes 
taken by a justice department lawyer 
this was a fourhour meeting with 29 pages of very cryptic 
notes said north who is accused of obstructing the inquiry by 
meese and making false statements 
north is charged with lying by allegedly omitting any mention of 
secords role in the diversion of the iranian arms sales proceeds 
to the contras at a time when congress banned aid to the rebels 
meese and his aides said north told them that the national 
security council had no involvement in the diversion and that 
israel determined how much would be diverted 
in the interview with meese north also said he told contra 
leader adolfo calero to open bank accounts in switzerland to 
receive the money from israel according to the indictment 
north from the witness stand gave a different account of what 
transpired in the sunday afternoon meeting in meeses office he 
said he told the attorney general that israel subtracted 
operational costs in the iran weapons operation thus determining 
how much was left over and available for the contras and other 
projects 
north said he told meese the nsc was not involved in moving the 
diversion money through various accounts he said he also told the 
attorney general that swiss bank accounts to receive the diversion 
money had been set up by secord 
the diversion of funds from the iran arms sales to the contras 
was a secret within a secret and north did not bring it up 
until meese handed him a memo outlining it he said 
by golly when they raised it i told them about it north 
testified

police raided a farmhouse equipped with 
torture chambers tunnels to hide kidnap victims and a shooting 
range and they said the complex was used by a paramilitary group 
linked to the medellin drug cartel 
in the raid wednesday police said they arrested 10 gunmen and 
freed two kidnap victims from the center in a country home near 
envigado 10 miles from medellin colombias secondlargest city 
members of the paramilitary group were warned of the raid by a 
sophisticated alarm system and at least 10 escaped said col 
antonio sanchez vargas the police chief of medellin 
police found powerful communications equipment weapons and cars 
at the site he said 
martin alonso alvarez one of two people released from the 
tunnels said he was kidnapped wednesday and beaten by gunmen who 
asked him if he belonged to the cali drug cartel 
the cali cartel is colombias secondlargest drug trafficking 
ring and is battling the medellin group for control of the 
billiondollar new york drug market medellin reportedly is the 
worlds largest drug ring and controls about 80 percent of us 
drug markets 
more than 120 people have died in the 15month battle between 
the cartels and there have been more than 30 dynamite and firebomb 
attacks against property owned by leaders of the rings army 
officials said 
between them the cartels control 13 private armies and about 
2000 men said gen miguel maza marquez the head of the secret 
police in a report to president virgilio barco 
maza marquez said at least one of the paramilitary groups was 
trained in puerto boyaca 70 miles northeast of bogota by british 
and israeli experts he did not elaborate 
drug trafficking rings trained the paramilitary groups to 
protect themselves and kill those who interfere with their drug 
business according to maza marquez 
last week another training center also linked to the medellin 
cartel was discovered on a farm near puerto lopez 90 miles east of 
bogota 
on the grounds police found secret tunnels training centers 
for hired gunmen and the graves of five people

the aids crisis is still growing but slowing 
federal aids officials said thursday adding that the focus of the 
disease in the united states is shifting away from the crowded 
northeast 
in a report on the eight years since aids was first reported 
the national centers for disease control said the rate of increase 
in the number of documented aids cases has steadily declined 
for the most part 
in the cdcs latest monthly count the nation has reported 
90990 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 52435 of 
those patients or 58 percent have died 
the number of aids cases as compared to the year before shot 
up 215 percent from 1982 to 1983 since then the increase has 
slowed for the most part up 117 percent in 1984 84 percent in 
1985 60 percent in 1986 60 percent again in 1987 and 34 percent 
last year when 32311 cases were reported said dr jeannette 
stehrgreen chief of the cdcs aids reporting and analysis section 
the 60 percent increase for 1987 which remained unchanged from 
the year before came at a time when the medical definition of aids 
was changed resulting in more cases being reported 
the numbers are still increasing but theyre not increasing 
as rapidly stehrgreen said its important for people to 
realize the number of cases is still increasing and the 
increases in certain populations are still very significant 
blacks and hispanics the cdc noted continue to be 
disproportionately represented among aids patients 
blacks make up 27 percent of all reported cases hispanics 
account for 15 percent the us population is about 12 percent 
black and about 6 percent hispanic 
while the overall increase in aids has slowed the geographic 
focus of the disease has moved only 32 percent of the nations 
aids cases in 1988 were reported from new york new jersey and 
pennsylvania compared to 54 percent four years earlier 
its moving outside of the major metropolitan areas and 
outside the northeast stehrgreen said noting that the 
proportion of cases in urban areas under 500000 population 
increased from 12 percent in pre1986 years to 19 percent in 1988 
still aids incidence is highest in the most populous 
metropolitan ares in the united states the cdc said in its 
weekly report metro areas with more than a million people comprise 
41 percent of the nations population but account for 75 percent 
of its aids cases the new york city area has reported the largest 
number of aids cases 18860 
as has been the case since the epidemics earliest days most 
aids patients are male 91 percent of the adult or adolescent 
cases reported and the vast majority of all patients still are 
homosexual or bisexual males 60 percent intravenous drug abusers 
20 percent or both 7 percent

two former executives of a california 
defense contractor were convicted of conspiracy and wire fraud 
thursday in the first trial arising from the pentagon corruption 
scandal 
a federal court jury deliberated nearly 36 hours over four days 
before returning guilty verdicts against george kaub and eugene 
sullivan former vice presidents of teledyne electronics of newbury 
park calif 
each was convicted on one count of conspiracy kaub was found 
guilty on five counts of wire fraud and two counts of filing false 
statements sullivan was convicted on three counts of wire fraud 
a third defendant dale schnittjer was acquitted on conspiracy 
and wire fraud charges by us district judge richard williams 
after the jury failed to reach a verdict against him schnittjer is 
also a former vice president of teledyne electronics 
all the defendants were found innocent of bribery a charge 
stemming from the governments contention that the former 
executives knew money was paid to a navy engineer for inside 
information about a 24 million contract for handheld radar test 
equipment 
kaub who faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in jail and a 
fine of 2 million hung his head and stared at the defense table 
after the bailiff read the verdict 
sullivan could be sentenced to 20 years in jail and fined a 
maximum of 1 million he appeared impassive 
schnittjer had a hint of a smile on his face 
williams set sentencing for june 7 as attorneys for kaub and 
sullivan said they would appeal the verdict 
assistant us attorney joseph aronica said he was pleased with 
the convictions which he called significantthis sends a message 
to corporate america that they cannot wash their hands of this type 
of activity he said after the four women and eight men returned 
their verdict 
he said the governments ill wind investigation into 
kickbacks payoffs and fraud in the defense departments 
150billionayear purchasing system was expanding and 
continuing 
the pentagon procurement investigation began in mid1986 but was 
not publicly disclosed until june 1988 when federal agents armed 
with search warrants descended on defense contractors from 
coasttocoast 
the first indictment was handed up in january besides the three 
teledyne executives it names private consultants william parkin 
and fred lackner stuart berlin a navy official and teledyne 
industries the parent of teledyne electronics 
all pleaded guilty in advance of the trial execept for the 
company officials teledyne pleaded guilty to conspiracy and filing 
false statements it paid 43 million in fines penalties and 
damages 
during the trial parkin and lackner testified they had paid 
bribes to berlin in exchange for his illegal help on the radar 
contract teledyne was awarded in july 1987 berlin admitted 
receiving teledynes money passed through the consultants 
aronica argued that kaub sullivan and schnittjer had conspired 
to pay parkin a total of 160000 for his help on the radar 
contract most of the money 150000 was to be paid after the 
contract came through he said 
according to aronica the defendants whom he described as 
smart capable and very very careful knew that parkin 
and his associates were engaged in illegitimate activites every 
step possible was taken to conceal it he said 
defense attorneys however said their clients were the victims 
of a conspiracy devised by parkin lackner berlin and michael 
savaides another former teledyne employee who worked in washington 
and had pleaded guilty 
my client was kept in the dark george oconnell sullivans 
lawyer said in his closing argument 
much of the evidence in the case came from wire taps that the 
government placed on parkins telephone the jury listened to tapes 
of the conservations between parkin and the defendants the wire 
fraud counts stemmed from those taperecorded conversations 
kaub was charged with filing false statements because he 
authorized notifying the defense department that teledyne had not 
hired consultants to work on the radar contract 
schnittjers attorney stanley mortenson said his client came 
to teledyne electronics after the company had been awarded the 
radar contract 
but aronica said schnittjer was the person who paid parkin more 
than 18000 of the 150000 he was to receive once the pentagon 
ordered the equipment from teledyne 
parkin a former navy official who worked for a variety of 
defense contractors including boeing signed his original contract 
with teledyne in november 1985 
payments stopped once the ill wind investigation became public 
the jury found schnittjer innocent of four wire fraud counts 
but it could not reach a unanimous decision on whether schnittjer 
was guilty of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud 
williams at mortensons request dismissed those counts

the irancontra independent counsel is 
investigating allegations that reagan administration officials 
obstructed a senate investigation into links between the nicaraguan 
contras and drug traffickers sen john kerry dmass said 
thursday 
kerry who directed the investigation said several people who 
testified before his foreign relations subcommittee informed him 
they were interviewed by investigators for independent counsel 
lawrence walsh 
a former justice department official and the former us 
attorney in miami both told the associated press they were 
interviewed by walshs investigators both denied any wrongdoing 
walshs office which is currently prosecuting former national 
security council aide oliver north declined to comment 
kerry mentioned the obstruction investigation at a news 
conference that he called to discuss the 437page report of his 
subcommittee on terrorism narcotics and international operations 
despite kerrys allegations of obstruction the committee held 
extensive hearings last year concluding in its report that the 
reagan administration delayed halted or interfered with its 
own international antidrug operations in order to protect its 
central america policy 
the report said the administration looked the other way when law 
enforcement agencies learned that drug traffickers were protected 
and aided by some nicaraguan rebels known as contras by members 
of the honduran military panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega 
and bahamian officials 
the report also included a section on the alleged obstruction 
saying the justice department provided information to the 
committee that tended to discredit allegations about contra drug 
links 
the department according to the report kept telling the 
subcommittee the persons who had made the allegations had 
significant credibility problems and there was no truth to the 
allegations 
the subcommittee concluded however that such links existed and 
devoted a large section of the report to them 
the report said a former assistant us attorney in miami 
jeffrey feldman told the subcommittee that he learned of possible 
obstruction of kerrys committee during a meeting with justice 
department officials on nov 18 1987 
feldman said department officials told him that representatives 
of the justice department the drug enforcement administration and 
the fbi met in 1986 to discuss how sen kerrys efforts could be 
undermined 
feldman who helped uncover secret us aid to the contras 
during a congressional ban on such assistance told kerrys panel 
that he believed the justice department may have delayed his 
investigation too 
it made sense that if the department didnt support your 
investigation then they wouldnt support my investigation the 
report quotes feldman as telling the subcommittee 
feldmans former boss leon b kellner who was us attorney in 
miami said in an interview he was questioned by a walsh 
investigator late last year 
kellner said the interview concerned a confidential transcript 
of a committee executive session that found its way to kellners 
files 
he said he received the transcript from the justice department 
but added he could not remember who gave it to him and the copy he 
received kellner added did not indicate it was the transcript 
of an executive sesssion on the committees contra investigation 
kenneth p bergquist an assistant secretary of the navy who 
formerly served in the justice departments congressional affairs 
office said i can confirm i was interviewed by an fbi agent 
making inquiries about obstruction of kerrys committee about a 
month ago the fbi agent was working for walsh 
the kerry report said bergquist was among the justice department 
officials who tried to discredit the information the committee was 
receiving on the contras 
bergquist called the obstruction charges patently ridiculous 
it is unbelievable kerry is very quick with charges and im tired 
of his lame accusations 
bergquist said he attended the 1986 justice department meeting 
during which feldman said there was talk of undermining the 
committee but bergquist said no one said that the purpose of 
that meeting was to undermine anybody 
kerry told the news conference that antidrug efforts in the 
reagan administration took second place to foreign policy mainly 
for fear of jeopardizing the war in nicaragua but he said that 
same war provided an opportunity for drug traffickers to link up 
with the contras and they did 
sen mitch mcconnell rky ranking republican on the 
subcommittee said in a written statement that while he agreed with 
substantial portions of the report there were inaccuracies 
in the representations of fact on the contradrug issue

against the agents but said there have been over the years 
many threats against the eradication workers

assailants were drug traffickers or members of the violent maoist 
sendero luminoso shining path guerrillas a rebel group that has 
gained strength in the past few years

they arent participating in eradication measures theres other 
kinds of work that can be done down there such as intelligence

neither ms shaw nor dougherty would reveal how many agents are 
involved in operation snowcap which has operations in peru and

house speaker jim wright said today that he 
never knowingly or intentionally violated house rules and 
asked for the very earliest possible opportunity to answer 
ethics committee charges against him 
in a defiant defense of a lifetime in public life wright choked 
back tears as he vowed to defend his wife betty who figures in 
the allegations against him she is a a good decent caring 
thoroughly honorable person wright said and ill damn well 
fight to protect her honor and integrity from any challenge from 
any source whatever the cost 
wrights performance signaled his determination to fight 
aggressively against the ethics committee charges allegations 
that could ultimately lead to his removal as speaker 
wright spoke even before a formal announcement of the vote by 
democrats and republicans on the ethics committee to pursue 
allegations that he improperly accepted gifts from a business 
partner and tried to evade outside income limits through the sale 
of his books 
he was flanked by a virtual whos who of house democratic 
leaders as he appeared before reporters the scene unfolded in the 
ornate rayburn room a few steps outside the house chamber a hall 
named for another texas democrat who rose to become speaker of the 
house 
i will fight to the last ounce of conviction and energy that i 
possess wright vowed 
i am confident that in the 34 years i have served in the 
congress i have not violated any of those basic rules or any 
commonly accepted standard of ethical conduct said wright 
i am prepared to demonstrate that in each of these instances 
no rule has been violated wright said of the ethics committee 
charges 
this house has been my life for more than half of my life 
wright said i love this institution 
wright made a detailed defense against the allegations he faces 
after noting that the ethics committee had not yet established any 
proof that he had violated the rules or even that there was 
clear and convincing evidence of a violation 
the public scene came after a private defense 
the last of the ethics decisions were reached wednesday on 
strong bipartisan votes according to sources familiar with the 
panels probe the votes mean the panel has found reason to 
believe wright violated a series of house rules and they point 
toward a new phase of the case which could involve a disciplinary 
hearing and possible punishment 
wrights spokesman mark johnson said late wednesday that the 
speaker had not been informed of any decision by the panel all 
options are open in defending against the charges he said 
the action essentially completed the committees 10month 15 
million investigation of wrights finances the panel was meeting 
again today to work on the specific wording of its report detailing 
the basis for the charges against the speaker one source said 
the panel has met behind closed doors and under tight secrecy 
for three weeks to deliberate the recommendations of its special 
outside counsel chicago attorney richard phelan 
in the final days of that process committee members narrowed 
their focus to the two most serious issues before them the 
acceptance of gifts from a person with an interest in legislation 
and the evasion of outside income limits 
on wednesday the committee voted that benefits received from 
fort worth developer george mallick from 1980 through 1984 valued 
at more than 100000 amounted to unreported gifts that were 
improper because mallick an investor in real estate and oil and 
gas ventures had a greater interest in congressional legislation 
than an ordinary citizen said one source 
the panel also concluded that wright in roughly half a dozen 
instances had foregone speaking fees from groups he had addressed 
and instead sold them bulk quantities of his book reflections of 
a public man under house rules speaking fees are subject to 
limits while book royalties are not 
most difficult for the committee sources said was the issue of 
whether mallick a longtime friend of wright had motives other 
than friendship when he paid the speakers wife betty 18000 a 
year in salary and gave the wrights rentfree use of a condominium 
and a 1979 cadillac 
house rules prohibit the acceptance of more than 100 a year in 
gifts from anyone with a direct interest in legislation 
ultimately a majority of the panels six democrats and six 
republicans agreed with special counsel phelan that the standard 
for whether an individual has a direct interest in legislation 
before the congress should be a broad one phelan argued that 
because of mallicks extensive real estate and oil and gas 
holdings mallick was inherently interested in what goes on in 
congress 
that decision has major implications for future ethics standards 
in the house and was troubling to some members of the committee 
because it seemed to suggest that members of congress must be 
restricted in their friendships 
people are trying to invent a rule that isnt there argued 
rep david obey dwis reacting earlier wednesday to reports of 
the committees activities obey was the primary author of the 1977 
rules revisions under which the house operates we were not 
drawing up a gift rule that would impinge upon peoples normal 
longstanding friendships he said 
the next step for the ethics panel is to issue a formal 
statement of the allegations against wright the speaker then will 
have 21 days to present rebuttals and counterarguments before the 
committee determines whether to call for a disciplinary hearing to 
decide whether sanctions are warranted 
sanctions can range from a simple reprimand to expulsion from 
the house 
even before the panels conclusions were known wednesday 
democratic lawmakers were nervous and began to look ahead to the 
issues political fallout 
one member of the democratic leadership speaking only on 
condition of anonymity said if the ethics committee recommends any 
punishment for wright he will be automatically out as speaker 
theres no option the lawmaker said

the uss samuel b roberts crippled a 
year ago when it struck a mine in the persian gulf is back in the 
water for the conclusion of a 90 million repair job intended to 
make it better than new 
after six months in dry dock the 445foot guided missile 
frigate was refloated early this month at bath iron works where 
the complicated repairs are expected to be finished in october a 
month ahead of schedule 
the roberts and its sister ship the uss stark were damaged 
while on duty in the persian gulf during the war between iran and 
iraq the frigates are the first us warships to undergo repairs 
for battle damage since the korean war 
the stark was repaired at the ingalls shipyard in pascagoula 
miss at a cost of 829 million and rejoined the fleet last 
summer thirtyseven crew members were killed when the stark was 
hit by a missile fired from an iraqi jet on may 17 1987 
the 3700ton roberts was damaged on april 14 1988 when it hit 
an iranian mine while escorting reflagged kuwaiti tankers in the 
gulf ten sailors were injured 
the blast which nearly sank the roberts hit amidships below 
the waterline it demolished the engine room carved a 22foot gash 
in the hull and forced a repair job even more complex than the 
starks 
from the standpopair 
it was the type of damage sustained by a car that goes off a 
road and lands on a boulder destroying the entire drive train but 
leaving the external structure intact said cmdr john w townes 
iii who took over as skipper after the roberts was damaged 
the repairs to the stark and the roberts have been viewed as 
tests of both the shipbuilding industrys ability to reconstruct 
todays hightech warships and the nations political resolve in 
putting battledamaged vessels back in action swiftly and 
effectively navy and shipyard officials say 
supervisors at bath iron works which built the roberts three 
years ago say the task of repairing a modern warship and its 
computercontrolled propulsion system poses a unique technological 
challenge 
what has not been done before is putting an electronic engine 
room back together theres a world of difference between this 
engine room and the ones in the world war ii destroyers price 
said 
congress authorized 96 million for the repair job and biw says 
the costs are running 2 million to 3 million under budget the 
roberts cost roughly 350 million when it was built and outfitted

the defense minister has rejected suggestions for 
converting the soviet armed forces into an allvolunteer unit half 
its current size 
i am shaken by the incompetence and lightmindedness of the 
authors of such innovations when they approach the most important 
state question the guarantee of the security of the country 
dmitri t yazov said in a frontpage signed article published 
thursday in the military newspaper red star 
yazov seemed to support the unilateral reductions already 
announced by president mikhail s gorbachev they would cut the 
armed forces by 500000 men to 3760000 yazov also said weapons 
production is being cut by onefifth 
but he was sharply critical of suggestions the army could be cut 
in half indicating the top soviet brass was in favor of 
maintaining compulsory military service for males 
deferrals for university students were announced last month 
they still must serve in the armed forces after graduation 
although their term of service has been reduced to one year 
a highly paid volunteer army would become an elite class in 
society contradicting the nature of a socialist army where 
everyone is drafted yazov said ideals of duty to the country 
would be replaced by materialism he said 
yazov also said a volunteer army under capitalism serves the 
interest of the ruling class a criticism that brings communist 
ideology back into a debate that often has centered on efficiency 
and budgetcutting 
lt col alexander savinkin opened the debate last fall with an 
article in the moscow news weekly calling for a smaller more 
professional allvolunteer army with better training in 
hightechnology weaponry 
yazov said the current two to threeyear hitch is sufficient 
for the average soldier to learn discipline and the use of certain 
arms 
a separate article in the communist party newspaper pravda 
written by the armed forces deputy political director adm a 
sorokin said onefifth of the 500000 troops cut from the military 
would be officers typically those with only a few years service 
cadets in military academies also will be trimmed he said 
generally the troop cuts will be among older soldiers ready to 
retire because they have qualified for pensions or received 
apartments sorokin said 
in addition he wrote we are not keeping a secret of the fact 
that we are trying to get rid of those who are not in harmony with 
morality honor and duty 
sorokin admitted that finding homes for 500000 released 
soldiers will be no easy task in a country already struggling with 
a severe housing shortage 
plans have been made to build 7500 apartments for former 
officers but for the rest the communist party leadership and 
local authorities must take urgent measures to find housing he 
said

federal investigators have identified a 
handful of passengers who unwittingly may have brought aboard the 
bomb that blew up pan am flight 103 over scotland in december a 
bush administration official said thursday 
cbs reported wednesday that suspicion had centered on a member 
of the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command who is a relative of hafez dalkamoni cbs said dalkamoni 
reportedly set up the network that carried out the attack in which 
270 people including 189 americans perished 
an administration official knowledgeable about the investigation 
disputed the cbs account that investigators had concluded the 
passenger who carried the bomb aboard was khalid jaafar a young 
americanlebanese college student returning to michigan from 
frankfurt for the christmas holidays 
federal bureau of investigation agents have questioned jaafars 
parents at the familyrun gas station in detroit but the parents 
insist he was not involved 
the official said jaafar was only one of several passengers 
suspected of unwittingly bringing the explosive aboard and no 
one in the popular front is talking said the official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
another government source said the chief theory of 
investigators is that the bombing was the work of the 
syriansponsored popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command 
investigators theorize that the group headed by ahmed jabril 
may have carried out the attack at the behest of iran said the 
source who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
the group was identified wednesday in a state department 
terrorism report to congress as having carried out numerous 
crossborder attacks against israel and violently opposed to the 
palestine liberation organization 
jabril is identified as a former captain in the syrian army the 
group is closely allied with syria and probably receives directions 
from syria its chief sponsor 
cbs said many of the leads in the case are coming from a member 
of the front who is cooperating with investigators but the us 
official told the associated press that there is nothing that 
links the command directly right now with flight 103 
the london daily telegraph reported meanwhile that 
investigators had narrowed the number of people suspected of being 
duped into carrying the bomb aboard to three to five american 
passport holders who probably joined the flight in frankfurt 
the newspaper said fbi agents were searching european cities to 
find the terrorist who gave the passenger the radiocassette player 
in which investigators have confirmed the bomb was placed 
investigators have narrowed the probes focus the investigation 
chief said thursday the lord advocate lord fraser scotlands 
chief law officer who is ultimately responsible for the crash 
investigation said in a statement 
there has been a narrowing in the focus of the inquiry but it 
would be inadvisable for me to comment on these reports at this 
stage any statement i make on the progress of the investigation 
must be based on firm evidence and not on the basis of comment or 
conjecture attributed to official sources 
if there is firm evidence which can be revealed without 
prejudicing the inquiry or the prospects for a criminal 
prosecution disclosure of that will be authorized 
the pan am jumbo jet crashed in southern scotland on dec 21 
killing all 259 people aboard and 11 people on the ground 
dalkamoni was in prison at the time having been picked up last 
october following a raid on one of his safe houses along with 
weapons german police found three toshiba radiocassette players 
similar to the one used to blow up pan am 103 cbs said 
meanwhile an administration source sadi thursday that president 
bush will visit lockerbie stopping on the way back from a nato 
summit in brussels belgium and visits to italy england and west 
germany he is scheduled to leave washington on may 26 and return 
june 1 or 2 
a white house survey team already has visited lockerbie and an 
advance team is expected to stop there within the next week for 
further planning said the source speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
bush recently met at the white house with a delegation of 
relatives of victims of the pan am flight

policeman a federal police volunteer a 16yearold boy and mark 
kilroy a 21yearold university of texas premedical student who 
disappeared march 14 in matamoros while on spring break 
mexican police believe two victims were executed as revenge for 
a drug deal that went bad hernandez rivera said some were killed 
out of vengeance rather than as sacrifices 
mattox said the ranch apparently was used as a drugsmuggling 
base and members were smuggling about 1000 pounds of marijuana a 
month into the united states 
at least one victim was kidnapped in the texas border city of 
brownsville within the last month and up to three may be us 
citizens officials said 
constanzo killed kilroy said one of the arrested men serafin 
hernandez garcia 22 a us citizen from brownsville 
constanzo apparently introduced a sort of voodoo or black magic 
to the area said oran neck the us customs chief agent in 
brownsville just across the rio grande 
the four suspects said they followed constanzos orders to 
kidnap people 
another suspect david serna valdez a 22yearold agronomy 
student from matamoros said he did not know about murders when he 
was recruited 
felipe flores spokesman for the mexican attorney generals 
office said victims brains were cut out and put on a fire mixed 
with blood herbs rooster feet goat heads and turtles 
cameron county sheriff alex perez said cult members removed some 
victims vertebrae for use in necklaces 
contrary to officials earlier assertions no evidence of 
cannibalism was found neck said 
the five suspects were detained pending the filing of formal 
charges of murder kidnapping drug smuggling criminal association 
and possession of illegal firearms said jose silva arroyo 
narcotics supervisor for the mexican federal judicial police 
the police were on a routine drug search when they found the 
dismembered bodies tuesday in shallow graves at the ranch 
some victims were shot in the head and others appeared to have 
been slain with machetes or sledgehammers neck said 
kilroy apparently was chosen at random after the cult members 
were told to pick one anglo male that particular night said 
cameron county sheriffs lt george gavito 
i didnt kill him but the others who killed him hit him with 
a machete hernandez garcia said 
perez said suspects confessed to removing kilroys brain and 
spine and chopping off his legs in some forms of witchcraft 
removal of the brain signifies a sacrifice of the victims soul 
i think they must be possessed by the devil that would be the 
only explanation for what they did kilroys mother helen said 
i will pray for them so they will realize how wrong all this is 
a memorial service was scheduled for kilroy tonight in 
brownsville in kilroys hometown of santa fe texas a yellow 
ribbon ceremony had been scheduled for wednesday to draw attention 
to his disappearance after his remains were discovered it became

the government has filed a complaint seeking 
14 million in fines against an illinois manufacturer of 
catalytic converter replacement pipes that the environmental 
protection agency maintains are ineffective 
the complaint was filed by the justice department on behalf of 
the epa in federal court in chicago against ceds inc of addison 
ill the epa said thursday 
the epa accused the company which also does business as 
products for power of failing to abide by a 1987 settlement 
agreement in which the company allegedly said it would pay 75000 
in fines and stop selling the replacement pipes 
despite the widespread misperception that these pipes will 
improve vehicle performance they are merely lengths of plain 
exhaust tubing cut to fit in place of catalytic converters and 
offer no performance advantages over properly functioning catalytic 
converters said the epa 
the pipes dramatically increase emissions of 
healththreatening pollutants by releasing untreated exhaust 
gases said don clay acting epa assistant administrator for air 
and radiation 
the action filed in federal court asks that the company pay 
135000 in civil penalties for failing to comply with the 1987 
agreement and 2500 in additional penalties per day that it was in 
noncompliance the overall fine would exceed 14 million the 
agency said

yuri v dubinin the soviet ambassador to the 
united states accused the bush administration on thursday of 
moving too slowly on bilateral negotiations 
dubinin urged the administration which has been conducting a 
strategic review of security policies to spell out its 
positions before secretary of state james a baker iiis scheduled 
may 1011 visit to moscow the review is to be completed by may 10 
sovietamerican dialogue is essential to building new 
international relations dubinin said in a speech at a meeting of 
the american society of newspaper editors 
apparently this is the reason why more and more questions are 
being asked in the ussr and throughout the world as to when the 
sovietamerican dialogue will be resumed in its entirety he said 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev voiced similar complaints 
last week during a visit to great britain bush countered 
gorbachevs statements by saying that his administration was 
making a prudent review mr gorbachev knows there is no 
footdragging going on 
dubinin said that as to the soviet union we are prepared to 
resume the negotiations at any moment on strategic arms human 
rights regional problems bilateral relations and other issues 
the ambassador brushed aside a question about whether the soviet 
sale of bombers to libya contradicted its stated desire to shift to 
a more peaceful foreign policy 
yes we have sold several units of this aircraft to libya but 
it was done a lot of time ago said dubinin 
they are not modern aircraft they are not so modern as those 
that israel has that is why it is not at all a basis to put 
into question the new policies in the soviet union the new 
thinking in our policy he said 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir following dubinin before 
the same audience said the sale worried his government 
it obliges us to remain always ready to face any surprise 
said shamir we are very sorry that we cannot see in this regard 
any change in soviet policy in our area so far there is continuity 
the soviets are selling arms to their clients libya and 
syria 
us officials said last week that the soviet union had sold 
libya su24 bombers with ranges of up to 800 miles enough to 
reach egypt or israel two nations with which libya has hostile 
relations 
last week soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov said the soviet union sold six shortrange bombers to 
libya under a 1986 contract but did not identify the planes by 
name

a commission is investigating whether soldiers 
used shovels to beat nationalist demonstrators in soviet georgia 
during a clash in which 19 people died a government spokesman said 
thursday 
in the georgian capital of tbilisi scene of the sunday 
confrontation an estimated 2000 people marched through the 
streets for the first funeral for one of the victims psychiatrist 
zia djinjaradze 42 according to a local human rights activist 
pravda the communist party daily reported georgian activists 
have changed their tactics in the face of soviet troops keeping 
order in tbilisi and are handing out handwritten leaflets to press 
for a general strike 
the georgian communist partys ruling politburo met thursday and 
said the situation remained strained with universities and 
schools still shut by boycotts it said factories and public 
transport were operating normally 
the tass news agency in its report on the meeting gave no word 
on leadership changes local party chief dzhumber i patiashvili 
offered to resign tuesday after accepting responsibility for 
sundays events approval by the georgian partys central committee 
would be necessary to replace patiashvili 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told a news 
briefing in moscow that a commission investigating charges of 
brutality in tbilisi was probing whether soldiers who broke up the 
protest by proindependence forces were in possession of short 
metal shovels customarily used for digging trenches 
the troops were not supposed to have those spades gerasimov 
said 
if an investigation finds soldiers beat the protesters with 
shovels there is a question of whether these people should be 
punished or not he said 
however gerasimov justified the decision to clear the square of 
protesters saying we should take into account the situation 
which evolved since endless meetings lasted for five days and they 
all but paralyzed the work of enterprises and people also 
attempted to penetrate the territory of government institutions 
patiashvili said he did not expect fatalities when troops were 
ordered to break up the demonstration outside tbilisis government 
house because they were equipped only with nightsticks and shields 
but several georgians who spoke in telephone interviews said the 
soldiers also were carrying shovels 
sergei dandurov a human rights activist said police and troops 
made no attempt to stop ms djinjaradzes funeral cortege as it 
wound through streets near tbilisis university at 4 pm 
they didnt create obstacles to the funeral dandurov said 
he said some policemen even joined the marchers whom he estimated 
numbered 2000 
at the site of the bloody confrontation a spontaneous memorial 
has appeared piled with fresh flowers said an editor at 
akhalgarda kommunisti the georgian communist party youth newspaper 
pravda said pickets in tbilisi were calling on workers to 
strike but gerasimov said all enterprises were working and that 
only the university and some schools remained disrupted by strikes 
the curfew remains in effect and alcohol sales have been 
restricted gerasimov said foreign reporters have been barred from 
traveling to tbilisi since unrest there began 
red star the military daily said groups of 1520 activists 
were passing out leaflets and spreading rumors in the city of 12 
million people 900 miles south of moscow 
some leaflets contain lists which claim to identify further 
victims of sundays clash beyond the 19 officially confirmed dead 
said the akhalgadra kommunisti editor who refused to give his name 
activists also have been ripping down the announcements of the 
military command according to red star dandurov said two statues 
of bolsheviks who helped establish soviet power in the caucasus 
sergei kirov and sergo ordzhonikidze also were vandalized 
tbilisi was shaken by a minor earthquake thursday shortly after 
noon local time tass said the jolt measured only 5 on the 12point 
soviet scale at the epicenter in the mountains 60 miles to the 
east and only 4 in the capital of the republic 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze a georgian who served 
as the regions party chief from 1972 to 1985 was at the meeting 
of georgian party leaders thursday he has canceled trips to east 
germany and west germany because of the unrest 
on wednesday president mikhail s gorbachev appealed for calm 
in georgia in a message read on local radio and television and 
carried in the press he rejected the demands of nationalists who 
seek secession from the soviet union and blamed them for igniting 
the strife he said was damaging his reform drive 
the trouble in tbilisi started when protesters criticized calls 
from members of the republics ethnic abkhazian minority to break 
away because of alleged discrimination by georgians 
other protesters demanded georgia secede from the soviet union 
because of alleged interference from the central government and 
russians in the republics political economic and cultural affairs

the government said thursday that 
moslem guerrillas cut the major supply route from the soviet union 
and are preventing food convoys from moving on the key eastern road 
from pakistan 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani also said the 
insurgents fight to take the strategic eastern city of jalalabad 
has slackened the heavy rocket and artillery attack has dwindled 
to sporadic gunfire he said 
amani said the anticommunist fighters have blocked the salang 
highway at two towns north of the capital olang and jabalassanaa 
cutting off kabuls only land link with the soviet border 
security forces have launched an extensive moppingup operation 
and hope to reopen the highway friday he said 
diplomats in kabul said the blockade has nearly 140000 tons of 
food piled up at the soviet border amani said the last convoy 
brought food on april 6 
but diplomats say the highway has been closed for at least two 
weeks and is severely damaged in some places they credit the 
closure to guerrilla commander ahmed shah masood and his group 
jamatiiislami the insurgents say they control 20 miles of the 
highway 
a soviet airlift of food and military equipment continues to 
kabul but it carries less than half the 650 tons of flour that 
residents need each day 
in the east amani said only military convoys have traveled in 
the past two weeks on the highway to jalalabad the key route to 
pakistan 
people are afraid and dont want to travel but conditions 
have improved he said 
the severity of the situation in jalalabad has decreased in 
the past 24 hours amani said 
one government soldier was killed in sporadic gunfire and the 
troops killed 35 insurgents and wounded 38 others he said 
the fight for jalalabad is the first guerrilla offensive since 
the soviet union completed its troop withdrawal from afghanistan on 
feb 15 under a unmediated accord 
if jalalabad fell it would be the biggest city the insurgents 
have captured and would give them momentum to advance on kabul 70 
miles to the west 
the capital has been relatively quiet this week with few 
incoming rockets 
elsewhere amani said guerrillas continued attacks on the 
southern towns of khost and ghazni 
in khost soldiers killed 185 guerrillas and lost nine troops 
nine civilians were wounded and two houses destroyed he said 
there were no casualties in ghazni he said 
it is impossible to verify government or guerrilla reports on 
the state of the war both sides sometimes exaggerate 
amani said government troops foiled a guerrilla attempt to move 
weapons and ammunition through the mountains of paghamn region east 
of kabul soldiers fired on the guerrillas who were carrying the 
weapons on donkeys and mules to fellow fighters in northern 
afghanistan he said without mentioning casualties 
government troops had another success on tuesday he said when 
they forced guerrillas to retreat from sarobi town halfway between 
kabul and jalalabad and the site of a power station that supplies 
electricity to kabul 
the insurgents who call themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors have been fighting nearly 11 years to topple the 
marxists who seized power in a coup 
moscow backs the afghan government while saudi arabia the 
united states pakistan and china support the mujahedeen

the federal government has made it too 
difficult for states to use medicaid to pay for home care services 
for the poor according to six senators who introduced a measure 
thursday designed to remedy the situation 
the legislation is aimed at thousands of medicaid beneficiaries 
who need help with their home routines but whose sickness or 
frailty is not severe enough to require them to enter a nursing 
home 
the bill designed to cut through red tape to make it easier for 
states to pay for at least part of the cost of home care under 
medicaid was unveiled at a news conference by its author sen jay 
rockefeller dwva the cosponsors are sens john heinz rpa 
paul simon dill george mitchell dmaine bill bradley dnj 
and david pryor dark 
in 1981 the government approved interim regulations authorizing 
states to get waivers to pay for home care under medicaid a 
federal program providing medical services to the needy 
the regulations specify that such care can be provided in the 
homes using medicaid funds only if it saves money over hospital or 
nursing home care 
the bill estimated to cost 680 million over the first five 
years would end the waiver system and make home care services an 
optional statewide benefit

a leading writer on islamic militancy said 
thursday that the ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis order to 
assassinate salman rushdie author of the novel satanic verses 
had nothing to do with revulsion over the contents of the book 
robin wright herself once the target of a mideast death threat 
said that khomeini seizing upon the growing fury among sunni and 
shiite moslems over the book issued the edict against rushdie in a 
bid to gain the leadership of the entire islamic world 
ms wright author sacred rage the wrath of militant islam 
and the upcoming in the name of god khomeinis revolutionary 
decade said khomeini also was using the issue to divert 
attention from domestic problems just as he created the us 
hostage crisis in 1979 to mobilize public support for his troubled 
regime 
but i suspect that khomeini is in a minority among iranian 
clerics and political leaders on the issue of rushdie she said 
noting the assassination order has erased most of the diplomatic 
gains made by iran since the end of the war with iraq she 
predicted history will view the episode as a tragic spasm 
ms wright a national security reporter for the los angeles 
times was among participants in a seminar on the rushdie affair at 
the annual convention of the american society of newspaper editors 
others included author larry mcmurtry ed murrow president of the 
american booksellers association and andy ross whose berkeley 
calif bookstore codys was bombed in february after it began 
selling satanic verses 
ross described in wrenching terms the anguish he and his 55 
employees went through in arriving at their joint decision to 
resume sales of the book after a molotov cocktail damaged the 
store but caused no injuries in the early hours of feb 28 
its quite possible my store has the dubious honor of being the 
first victim of international terrorism in the united states he 
said 
ross said the bombing accomplished its goal which was to 
create an atmosphere of terror and to let the world know that 
under the new order of things the sale of prescribed ideas could 
be conducted only at great personal risk 
i can tell you that the decision to carry the verses after 
the bombing was perhaps the most difficult decision of my life 
he said if people were murdered who is to say if such an act 
selling the book was courageous or foolhardy 
ross expressed some bitterness over criticism within the 
literary community of bookstores that withdrew the book from their 
shelves i personally thought it was unbecoming for norman mailer 
and others to expound from the safety of their coop apartments what 
was correct moral behavior for bookstores in the front lines 
stores on the street vulnerable to terrorist activity 24 hours a 
day he said 
he also said that the role of the media was a source of 
paradox the level of coverage was an element that only inflamed 
the fanatics the more you exericized your freedom of expression in 
reporting the story the greater the likelihood that my freedom of 
expression would be abridged by terror 
ms wright once threatened with death for reporting an 
attempted coup against syrian leader hafez assad said she did not 
doubt that khomeini was genuinely outraged by the comic and 
almost pornographic approach to islam taken in satanic verses 
but she noted the assassination order coupled with a 52 
million bounty offer was not issued until midfebruary five 
months after publication 
rushdie born in india of moslem parents and his american wife 
author mary wiggins went into hiding presumably in england 
shortly after khomeinis order 
the book includes a brothel scene in which prostitutes take the 
names of the prophet mohammeds wives and it suggest mohammed 
wrote the holy koran instead of receiving it from allah 
ms wright noted that islam is not the only religion to 
condemn those who engage in blasphemy she cited a passage from 
the book of leviticus in the old testament he that blasphemes 
the name of the lord shall surely be put to death and all the 
congregation shall certainly stone him 
mcmurtry author of lonesome dove and other bestsellers 
said that tyrants whether secular or religious have exhibited 
far more respect for language than have democratic governments 
tyrants demonstrate that respect by sending their most able and 
threatening servants the best writers to the stake the block or 
the gulag 
he complained that the response of western governments to 
khomeinis order insofar as theyve responded at all has been a 
light noise sounds without significance or without force in time 
virtually all communications will be weakened without unfettered 
freedom to express ourselves as we need to 
but ross said i was not exceedingly disturbed by the almost 
insultingly bland statements by public officials including 
president bush because they at least had the value of not inciting 
additional violence

members of congress introduced legislation 
thursday calling for the creation of a pacific basin forum that 
would enable the united states and asian nations to deal with 
issues such as free trade and economic development 
the united states has a pressing need to reinvigorate our 
diplomatic efforts in the pacific region an area currently 
undergoing a radical transformation said senate democratic whip 
alan cranston of california in introducing the measure 
cranston chairman of the senate foreign relations subcommittee 
on east asian and pacific affairs said china japan and south 
korea are experiencing an economic boom that is straining relations 
with the united states which has a trade deficit 
i propose that the united states promote the establishment of 
a pacific basin forum to pursue such crucial issues as free trade 
economic development and security confidence building cranston 
said 
the forum also would hold annual summit meetings involving the 
leaders of the asian nations and the united states establish a 
permanent secretariat for research and encourage private sector 
involvement in planning 
cranston said the forum would resemble nato and the annual 
economic summits with european leaders but stressed that he wasnt 
encouraging the creation of an asian trading bloc to rival the 
common market 
i do believe it is manifestly in the american interest to 
design a forum for focused discussion of these and related issues 
among pacific rim nations he said and i do believe it would 
serve our purposes to remind our friends in europe that we have 
important trade interests elsewhere 
additional sponsors of cranstons legislation were sens richard

outgoing white house science adviser william 
r graham jr on thursday criticized overly rigid 
compartmentalization of us research and development efforts 
arguing that a more coordinated strategy is needed to meet the 
challenges of global competition 
graham a holdover from the reagan administration questioned 
the feasibility of establishing a civilian counterpart to the 
pentagons defense advanced research agency which has funded 
leadingedge research in computers and other areas 
instead he urged better use of existing interagency groups to 
derive greater benefit from the 65 billion a year that the federal 
government is currently spending on research and development 
about 43 billion for defense programs and about 22 billion in the 
civilian area 
one of the luxuries weve had for the last 40 years is the 
luxury of compartmentalizing our activities very tightly this is 
defense department this is energy this is commerce and so on 
graham told a conference on federal science and technology policy 
he noted that weve seen the difficulties that creates in such 
areas as the fsx today which had been an activity undertaken 
largely for defense policy purposes by the us government while 
there was a substantial component of industrial policy on the part 
of the japanese 
graham was referring to a controversial project under which us 
and japanese companies are to codevelop and coproduce the fsx 
aircraft an advanced version of the f16 fighter for deployment 
by japan in the late 1990s 
a usjapanese agreement signed late last year had been 
negotiated by the pentagon and state department however after the 
bush administration took office the deal came under criticism from 
the commerce secretary robert mosbacher and us trade 
representative carla hills expressing concern that broader 
economic issues had not been fully taken into account 
as a result the administration has requested clarifications 
from tokyo before the fsx agreement is formally submitted to 
congress 
graham said the united states needs to look for opportunities 
where defense spending substantially helps us civilian industry 
comparable to the mid1950s when the boeing cos building of 
kc135 military tanker planes led to its successful development of 
the civilian 707 jetliner 
many more such opportunities exist in defense and other 
sectors i believe many more than were taking advantage of today 
and i believe the overly rigid compartmentalization with which 
weve viewed these rampd programs institutionally both in the 
government and in industry is limiting the benefits that we derive 
from the 65 billion that the federal government invests each 
year he said 
graham who became presidential science adviser in october 1986 
has stayed on at the white house pending the appointment of a new 
adviser by president bush 
asked how soon he believes a replacement will be named graham 
said ive learned that its always hazardous to secondguess the 
president but added that i would be surprised if its too much 
longer 
he spoke at a science and technology policy colloquium sponsored 
by the american association for the advancement of science

the government said thursday it has denied 
us export privileges to six europeans in two separate export 
control cases one involving alleged illegal shipments to the 
soviet union and the other related to the threat of illegal exports 
to bulgaria 
in the first case the commerce department issued orders denying 
export privileges to goran josberg and his firms globe trade 
globe computers and globe metals of stockholm sweden and to 
helmut keck and his firm otc messund videoteknik gmbh of 
hamburg west germany 
josbergs denial of export privileges extends for 35 years and 
kecks for 10 years the agency said 
between 1983 and 1985 josburg allegedly directed a conspiracy 
in which keck and others received sophisticated us technology and 
equipment through kecks dummy corporations in west germany the 
department said the two then allegedly reexported the technology 
through finland to the soviet union without authorization from the 
commerce department 
the equipment included a was3000 airstream modulator that has 
direct military applications because it is used to test missiles 
and missile components said paul freedenberg undersecretary for 
export administration 
some members of this hightech diversion ring posed as 
legitimate businessmen in sweden west germany and singapore to 
acquire usorigin technology for their carefully planned scheme 
to supply highly soughtafter militarily useful items to east bloc 
countries freedenberg said 
in the latter case the commerce department issued a 180day ban 
on export privileges for four businessmen and their firms because 
they were suspected of trying to obtain usorigin equipment for 
illegal export to bulgaria 
the order effective april 6 covers franciscus b govaerts and 
his firm printlas europa goris christiaan grandia and his firm 
grandia project services marcel sanders and his firm belgian 
trading company lokeren sa and roger van alphen 
the department alleged that govaerts attempted to export a 
memory test system and laser repair system to grandia and van 
alphen in the netherlands by falsely describing the equipment on a 
shippers export declaration 
grandia and van alphen with the help of sanders planned to 
reexport the equipment to grandias customers in bulgaria without 
approval the agency said sanders allegedly was to finance the 
illegal purchase and shipment commerce said 
govaerts and sanders were arrested on related charges in 
december and are awaiting trial grandia was arrested in italy and 
has been released on bail pending extradition to the united states 
van alphen still is at large the department said

still confident of the wartime abilities of its cruise missile 
even though charges filed this week against northrop corp charge 
the defense contractor falsified test data and installed defective 
parts in the missile 
defense department spokesman fred s hoffman said air force 
officials continue to believe the airlaunched missile is mission 
ready and added that any suggestion at this point that northrop 
may be suspended or dbarred is really speculative and premature 
 
the navy and air force are following standard procedures for 
dealing with contractors that have been indicted on federal 
charges the spokesman said under those procedures special 
administrative boards within the navy and air force have requested 
details of the northrop indictment from prosecutors 
at some point the boards will decide if the allegations are 
serious enough to warrant an immediate temporary suspension of 
northrops contracting rights 
but that has not yet happened hoffman said 
the aerospace giant and five current or former employees were 
charged with conspiring to defraud the government in the 
construction of part of the guidance system for the cruise missile 
and in the building of a component of the navys harrier attack jet 
the allegations involving the missile were viewed as 
particularly troubling because that weapon is part of the nations 
nuclear arsenal the 167count indictment charged that northrop and 
the employees conspired to install parts for the missiles flight 
data transmitter that failed to meet government specifications 
asked thursday if the air force thought it could rely on the 
weapon in view of the charges against northrop hoffman noted the 
allegations against the company first surfaced in 1987 
and the air force has been taking a series of remedial 
steps since then he continued so it is not something which 
just burst on them they were aware then and they have been taking 
action 
as things now stand the air force has full confidence that 
the airlaunched cruise missile is reliable and capable of carrying 
out its mission according to the air force it has a mission 
readiness rate well within acceptable limits that rate is 96 
percent 
as for the av8b harrier jump jet flown by the marine corps 
hoffman said the service had experienced higherthanexpected 
failure rates over the life of the program for a flight sensor 
assembly made by northrop 
however the sensor involved is not essential for safe flight 
and there have been no accidents nor any incidents im told that 
can be attributed to the failure of this component hoffman said 
northrop is the nations 32nd largest defense contractor having 
received contracts worth 5326 million in fiscal 1988 the company 
is a prime contractor on several key projects however including 
the b2 stealth bomber 
should either the navy or air force impose a suspension on the 
firm pending resolution of the charges it would affect northrops 
right to bid on and receive future contracts not those it already 
holds

japan is speeding the destruction of tropical 
rain forest in southeast asia because of its demand for timber 
according to a report thursday by the world wildlife fund a 
private environmental group 
coauthors of the report were yoichi kuroda coordinator of the 
japan tropical forest action network and francois nectoux a 
french economist who lectures at the south bank polytechnic in 
london 
south seas tropical forests are being destroyed for 
ineffective plywood uses and even disposable chopsticks said 
robert buschbacher director of the organizations forestry 
program in a statement 
as forests are eradicated in asia japan will look towards 
south america specifically the amazon to exploit 
the report entitled timber from the south seas said that 
in 1987 japan got 96 percent of its tropical hardwoods from sarawak 
and sabah in malaysia and from papua new guinea a statement by 
the fund said some of the worlds most biologically valuable 
forests are threatened with destruction in sabah and sarawak on 
the island of borneo 
in the 1960s and 1970s japans hardwoods came mainly from the 
philippines and indonesia according to the report 
a japanese embassy official who spoke on condition his name not 
be used questioned whether it took all the relevant facts into 
account he said japan gives due consideration to environmental 
matters in its import program it is a big contributor to both the 
united national environmental program and to the international 
tropicval timber organization in yokohama he added 
according to the report japan has been the worlds major 
importer of tropical woods for nearly 20 years taking about 2 
billion dollars worth in 1986 it said japan imports more than the 
united states and as much as the 12 countries of the european 
exconomic community taken together 
the time is ripe for many changes in japans relation towards 
tropical forests the report concluded so far this 
relationship has been mainly destructive 
it recommended a new policy to deal with both conservation and 
japans timber needs with increased aid for forest management 
concentration of imports on timber from areas where production can 
be sustained reduction of wasteful uses and substitution of 
softwoods where hardwood is not necessary

oliver north ended his testimony thursday 
after six grueling days on the witness stand saying he became sure 
he was being made the fall guy in the irancontra affair when he 
heard himself described at a white house news conference as the 
only one who knew what was going on 
attorney brendan sullivan later rested his case having called 
16 witnesses for the defense prosecutors who called 29 said they 
will have a few rebuttal witnesses on friday 
us district judge gerhard a gesell said he probably will give 
the jurors monday off while he decides what final instructions they 
will be given he said final arguments probably will take two days 
and the case should go to the jury on thursday in the 12th week of 
trial 
during four days of tough crossexamination north denied 
prosecution contentions that he lied about his irancontra efforts 
and personally profited from some of them he said he had explicit 
authorization from his superiors and he assumed from president 
reagan for his actions and didnt take a dime he wasnt entitled 
to 
he testified thursday that two days before the nov 25 1986 
press conference in which reagan and attorney general edwin meese 
iii took part north had been interviewed for four hours by meese 
and aides 
he is accused of lying during that interview but he testified 
he told them readily about the secret within the secret that 
profits from arms sales to iran had been funneled to the guerillas 
fighting the leftist government of nicaragua therefore he said 
he was shocked to learn that he might be the target of a criminal 
investigation 
what he heard as he watched the press conference on television 
north said was inconsistent with what i told the attorney 
general two days before meese said norths boss john 
poindexter had known of the money diversion but hadnt approved it 
when in fact he had 
north testified it was very clear to me that this was part of 
pointing the finger at ollie north he was the only one who knew 
what was going on which i must say is the way it was supposed 
to be norths firing and poindexters resignation as reagans 
national security adviser were announced by meese that day 
both at the trial which began jan 31 and at congressional 
hearings nearly two years ago north said he had assumed while he 
was directing covert aid to the contras that he would have to take 
the rap if word got out about the help which was being provided at 
a time that official us aid was banned 
prosecutor john kekers final questioning of north concerned two 
letters he wrote in december 1986 to a contractor who had installed 
a 13800 security system at norths home the letters were 
backdated to make it appear north had intended to pay for the 
system which had been paid for by retired maj gen richard 
secord whom north had recruited to run the contra supply effort 
the letters are the basis for one charge that north accepted an 
illegal gratuity 
north was still in the marine corps he said and didnt want to 
fabricate the letters at work because he didnt want the marines 
involved in that type of coverup therefore he testified he 
went to a catalog store to write the letters on display typewriters 
another of the 12 charges against north is that he obstructed a 
presidential inquiry by lying to meese and by altering destroying 
concealing and removing documents from the national security 
council office where he worked 
relying on notes taken at the nov 23 1986 meeting by meese 
chief of staff john richardson keker led north through facts that 
appeared to have been omitted by him in the meese meeting north 
said that the prosecutor was basing his questions on a very 
cryptic description of four hours of conversation 
he said he could not remember details of the interview but he 
also said i did the very best i could in telling the truth and 
answering their questions i have told you when i didnt tell 
the truth 
a day before the meese interview a search of norths office had 
uncovered a memorandum that spelled out the money trail from iran 
to nicaragua 
by golly when it was raised i told them the truth north 
testified when i got back to the white house i called to admiral 
poindexter to tell him the secret within the secret was now known 
to four other men 
the prosecution says north lied at the meeting about nsc 
involvement in the diversion about israels role and the 
involvement of secord 
the 12 felony charges against him also include lying to and 
obstructing congress converting contra travelers checks to his 
own use and conspiring to defraud the treasury and the internal 
revenue service

christian and moslem gunners pounded 
residential areas thursday stalling the evacuation of wounded to a 
french hospital ship as the bitter civil war that has claimed 
150000 victims entered its 15th year 
police said 19 people were killed and 50 wounded raising the 
toll to 215 dead and 727 injured since the artillery battle began 
march 8 between the christian army units of gen michel aoun and 
druse militiamen aided by syrian soldiers 
thursdays daylong bombardment was the fiercest since april 5 
when the arab league called for a ceasefire to halt the worst 
sectarian fighting since 1985 the truce like others in the long 
war soon failed 
artillery and rocket fire blocked plans to ferry moslem and 
christian wounded by helicopter to a french hospital ship in 
neutral waters off beirut 
the evacuation has been put off indefinitely a police 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity we do not know how long 
the french hospital ship will wait for security conditions to 
permit patients to be flown to it 
he said a rocket barrage at midday hit the main power 
distribution plant in jamhour a christian suburb blacking out 
beirut and the surrounding area 
all power distribution operations for the capital and its 
suburbs have come to a standstill said fares dagher of beiruts 
electricity authority we do not know when any repairs can be 
done 
a spokesman for the moslem cabinet of acting premier salim hoss 
said earlier a french navy tanker was ready to unload six tons of 
fuel oil friday at the moslem terminal at zahrani in south lebanon 
and at zouk a christian harbor north of beirut where the capitals 
main power plant is located 
shelling of storage depots has nearly wiped out the fuel supply 
and the power authority had said even the limited electricity 
supplied to beirut would stop unless stocks were replenished 
attilo iannucci the italian charge daffaires said the italian 
ship isola azzurra was hit by a shell off beirut port shortly after 
sunup but no one was hurt he said the vessel carrying 4000 tons 
of sulfuric acid headed for cyprus for repairs 
four shells were fired but the captain avoided three and only 
one hit the back of the ship way above water level iannucci said 
in an interview 
bernard kouchner frances minister for humanitarian assistance 
announced the plans for french helicopters to evacuate wounded 
lebanese to the hospital ship rance 
the minister who arrived tuesday said moslem victims would be 
flown from west beiruts bain militaire beach and christians from 
jounieh a christiancontrolled port 12 miles north of the city 
he did not give the location of the rance which has 90 beds and 
operating facilities the beirut newspaper assafir said it would 
anchor between moslem and christian waters eight miles out 
beirut hospitals had not asked that the ship be sent from 
france which ruled lebanon until independence in 1943 
medical sources said it was not needed to treat most of the 
wounded but could be useful for acute and specialized cases such 
as victims needing artificial limbs or 24hour care 
a source in the hoss cabinet said the bain militaire and jounieh 
port were repeatedly targeted by the shelling thursday 
hoss and aoun who commands the 20000 christians in lebanons 
army have led competing moslem and christian governments since a 
political crisis arose in september 
the artillery battle started two days after aouns forces 
blockaded illegal militiarun ports that deprive the five 
government ports of about 100 million a year 
lebanons civil war dates from april 13 1975 when christian 
gunman killed 29 palestinians in a bus ambush after a prominent 
member of the rightist christian phalange party was assassinated 
the political crisis began when president amin gemayels 
sixyear term ended and parliament could not agree on a successor 
he appointed aoun his army commander to lead an interim 
government and moslems swore allegiance to hoss the incumbent 
premier 
when competing governments emerged the army also split on 
sectarian lines the 22000 moslem soldiers led by maj gen sami 
khatib are poorly equipped and have stayed out of the fighting 
but help syrian troops blockade christian territory 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate from the arab league and has become the countrys main 
power broker in the chaos of civil war

solidarity founder lech walesa said 
thursday he was being pressured to run for office but would only 
want the newly created post of president of poland 
also on thursday solidarity filed an application to register as 
a trade union after a sevenyear ban the application at the warsaw 
regional court follows the historic agreement reached april 5 by 
the opposition and communist authorities to restore the unions 
legal status and allow independent candidates to run for parliament 
in june 
walesa said he expects solidarity to be registered by monday and 
added delaying of our activities doesnt serve us and doesnt 
serve poland 
he said he was under heavy pressure to run in the elections 
which the government thursday set for june 4 with runoff voting 
on june 18 
im being strongly pressed different people are pressing me 
and i am thinking about being a candidate to the highest organ that 
is going to be in poland walesa said at a news conference in his 
home city of gdansk 
walesa said later in a telephone interview that he would not run 
either for the newly created 100member senate which will be the 
east blocs first freely elected legislative chamber or the 
existing 460member sejm where the opposition can run for 35 
percent of the seats 
but he said he might like to be a candidate for president when 
the post next becomes available in six years although he wouldnt 
exclude his name from being put forward now 
i am a man of big interests said walesa an electrician who 
won the nobel peace prize for founding the east blocs first 
independent trade union during a 1980 strike at the gdansk shipyard 
any citizen can be nominated for president by onefourth of the 
sejm as the existing parliament is called and the senate the 
president will be jointly elected by the sejm and the senate 
the first sixyear term is widely expected to go to commmunist 
party leader gen wojciech jaruzelski due to the majority still 
guaranteed to the communist party and its allies in the larger sejm 
walesa who has indicated a preference for concentrating on 
union matters did not say who was pressuring him to seek office 
but there have been suggestions he should run to set an example for 
other opposition members who might be reluctant to replace election 
boycotts with participation the communistdominated government 
the roman catholic church with which walesa and solidarity are 
closely bonded has called on members in general to participate in 
the election 
solidarity wont directly field candidates for the elections 
but said it will support those named by a solidarity citizens 
committee that was formally created on saturday and is composed of 
top union leaders and adivsers 
the committee said it will put forward candidates for all 100 
senate seats and the 161 freely contested sejm seats solidarity 
national spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said the names of the 
candidates will be presented by the end of april or early may 
about 125 solidarity leaders and advisers from across poland 
gathered in a crowded church hall thursday to hear about the 
election procedures agreed upon at the talks and start planning the 
campaign 
a solidarity commission of eight key activists was formed to 
direct the election efforts under walesa 
solidarity plans to win these elections as much as is 
possible the elections will tell exactly who is right i wish well 
to all let the better win walesa said at the news conference 
he entrusted the task of filing the unions charter in court to 
tadeusz mazowiecki the opposition leader who negotiated trade 
union freedoms in the talks with the government 
mazowiecki said the union had submitted the same charter it had 
before solidarity was banned after the december 1981 martiallaw 
crackdown 
however it contains a new section that suspends provisions 
concerning strikes in effect making solidaritys charter adhere to 
polands 1982 trade union law which severely restricts the right 
to strike 
walesa said he thinks there should be the right to strike but 
sticking stubbornly to the right to strike by an association is 
abnormal in abnormal times 
the new parliament is expected to revamp the trade union law 
possibly expanding the right to strike 
also on thursday polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski met 
with roman catholic primate cardinal jozef glemp to discuss 
relations between the government and the church they discussed 
regulation of the legal status of the church relations with the 
vatican the outcome of the talks between the authorities and the 
opposition and upcoming elections the staterun pap news agency 
said 
elsewhere in warsaw several hundred students marched to protest 
conditions at the university library and 1500 elderly pensioners 
gathered at the official union alliance seeking more benefits 
authorities proposed the talks on political and economic reform 
in august 1988 at the peak of a nationwide wave of strikes in four 
months walesa refused to participate until authorities agreed to 
restore solidaritys legal status at a stormy plenum in january 
jaruzelski pressed the communist party to accept a legal solidarity 
and the talks finally began feb 6 
authorities hope the restoration of solidarity and opposition 
participation in parliament will create a period of social calm to 
give economic reforms designed to fight inflation chronic consumer 
shortages and a staggering foreign debt a chance

house democrats who reelected jim wright as 
speaker only four months ago agonized thursday over the prospect 
that an ethics committee report might compel them to strip their 
leader of his post 
i think theres deep concern both as to the person of the 
speaker and the congress itself said rep dale kildee dmich 
agony is probably the best word 
after a 10month investigation the ethics committee has found 
reason to believe that the texas lawmaker violated house rules in 
receiving financial benefits from a fort worth developer who had an 
interest in legislation and that the speaker improperly sought to 
evade limits on outside income with a book deal according to 
sources familiar with the probe 
in a sometimes emotional defense thursday wright denied 
violating any rules and asked for a quick decision from his 
colleagues 
i will fight to the last ounce of conviction and energy that i 
possess wright told reporters in the capitol i am confident 
that in the 34 years i have served in the congress i have not 
violated any of those basic rules or any commonly accepted standard 
of ethical conduct 
rep steny hoyer dmd who lined up behind wright with other 
house leaders and texas lawmakers said the speaker was being 
leaked to death and needed to respond 
i dont think the question is survival he said once the 
public hears wrights case he said i think they are going to 
conclude that hes absolutely telling the truth 
the full house not the committee is the final judge democrats 
fear theyll have to choose between jettisoning a leader who over 
three decades climbed to the top of their ranks and facing a 
political fallout that could harm them all 
theres sort of a foreboding here about what the congress has 
to confront this is all precedent setting said one democratic 
lawmaker who like many of those interviewed spoke on the 
condition his name not be used 
never has a house speaker been removed it is far from a 
foregone conclusion that wright will be the first 
i think all thats premature said rep pat williams 
dmont a wright ally when asked to speculate how democrats would 
react to the ethics committee report expected to be issued in the 
next few days 
williams was among those who said wrights future as speaker 
would depend in part on whether the ethics committee recommends 
punishment such as a formal reprimand or censure the committee 
decides that issue after the speaker is given a chance to respond 
to its charges 
the ground would start to move under him if he were 
reprimanded williams said 
if the committee merely scolds wright he can survive but if it 
recommends a reprimand or the more severe act of censure then 
there would be no option but to remove wright as speaker said 
another democrat 
the investigation against wright was begun following a complaint 
by rep newt gingrich rga who has since risen to the no 2 
position among house republicans 
the gop intends to make hay with whatever sunshine the committee 
provides house republican leader bob michel of illinois said he 
would use the rules to make sure that the full house votes on the 
wright matter regardless of what the committee recommends 
three house democrats launched another part of the counterattack 
in dear colleague letter thursday demanding that the ethics 
committee publish only information related to the actual charges it 
will level at wright republicans had been pushing for a full 
release of the special counsels report which contains material on 
allegations rejected by the committee 
releasing the other material unsubstantiated charges 
rumors innuendo and speculation on speaker wright would be a 
terrible precedent for the house threatens all members and makes a 
mockery of fair play said the letter from david nagle of iowa 
bob matsui of california and jim moody of wisconsin 
undoubtedly if wright became a political liability for the 
party many democrats would hope hed leave quietly but wright 
himself has indicated he wont easily give up the post that is the 
pinnacle of his career 
rep barney frank dmass said he believed democrats will not 
lightly discard their speaker for political advantage in their home 
districts 
i think people are less political than you sometimes think 
he said 
so far lawmakers said they saw no sign that anyone was moving 
against wright in a power grab i dont see any cannibalism going 
on said one 
you have a person who has every right to be treated justly 
kildee said i really think this is a very grave moral issue 
and if a vote comes each member will decide in the loneliness 
of our consciences 
several lawmakers expressed concern that the speaker was being 
held up to standards that sometimes werent clear and have changed 
over the years 
rep charles stenholm dtexas said even members of the house 
who have tried diligently to obey all ethical standards will wonder 
whether they could have survived the same kind of milliondollar 
investigation he cited the familiar phrase about people who live 
in glass houses 
most of us in the house are prepared to eat a steady diet of 
glass for the next few weeks he added

chancellor helmut kohl on thursday 
fired the defense minister and replaced seven other cabinet 
ministers in a longawaited shakeup aimed at boosting his 
governments appeal to voters 
the reorganization appeared to be mostly a seatswapping 
exercise with some important posts rotating among kohls closest 
advisers and others going to political allies to ensure their 
continued support 
kohls christian democratic union has suffered badly in recent 
local elections losing control of both the west berlin and 
frankfurt city governments to a rival coalition of leftleaning 
social democrats and environmentalist greens 
kohls party has been trailing the social democrats since the 
first of the year in nationwide polls 
kohl said the changes were in preparation for next years 
federal election campaign and not a direct result of the frankfurt 
and west berlin losses 
i had planned this cabinet rebuilding long before that kohl 
told a news conference 
also thursday kohl indicated he planned a sharp change in the 
nations immigration policies by making it more difficult for 
ethnic germans to immigrate to west germany 
we are not of the view that immigrants from every region of 
the world where there are germans should all be able to come to 
us he said in an interview aired on zdf television thursday 
night 
kohl has faced increasing criticism over the growing number of 
ethnic german immigrants who compete with west germans for scarce 
housing and jobs 
more than 200000 ethnic germans immigrated to west germany in 
1988 most of them from east bloc countries it has long been 
official government policy that ethnic germans have a right to 
immigrate to west germany 
the cabinet appointments effective april 21 replace kohls 
chief of staff and the ministers for defense finance interior 
transport economic cooperation construction and information 
he named finance minister gerhard stoltenberg to head the 
defense ministry the ministry has been the target of public 
criticism in the past year because of a string of deadly nato jet 
crashes and nato plans to replace shortrange nuclear missiles in 
west germany with rockets of a longer range 
kohl praised the outgoing defense minister rupert scholz who 
he said was confronted with many problems for which he cannot be 
made responsible 
scholz a former law professor was appointed in may and had no 
military experience he was often left to publicly defend the 
governments most controversial policies and absorbed the brunt of 
criticism over nato war games and noisy lowflying exercises 
stoltenberg became finance minister in 1982 when kohls party 
joined forces with the liberal free democrats to wrest the 
leadership from the social democratic party 
the social democrats declared the changes kohls last stand 
and blatant political tradeoffs the greens called them 
boring and desperate 
in addition to the change at the defense ministry the most 
significant appointment was the replacement of stoltenberg with 
theo waigel head of the christian democrats bavarian sister 
party the christian socialist union 
some government officials said privately the appointment was 
demanded of kohl to ensure the bavarian partys continued loyalty 
the christian socialist union now holds six of the 19 cabinet 
posts the christian democrats have nine and the free democrats 
four 
finance officials said waigel planned to repeal or sharply limit 
a new 10 percent withholding tax that took effect this year and 
drove some investments out of the country 
in other changes 
friedrich zimmermann switched from interior minister to 
transport minister 
chief of staff wolfgang schaeuble was promoted to interior 
minister 
rudolf seiters head of the christian democrats parliamentary 
delegation was named the new chief of staff 
the current transport minister juergen warnke was appointed 
to oversee international aid projects as minister for economic 
cooperation 
hans klein the economic cooperation minister became kohls 
official spokesman and head of the federal press and information 
office

the state departments top official on africa 
on thursday accused leaders of namibias swapo guerrillas of making 
a terrible decision in sending fighters on an armed incursion 
that is threatening the usmediated peace accord in the region 
assistant secretary of state chester crocker just back from an 
emergency meeting with cuban angolan and south african 
representatives said he thought the agreement that went into 
effect april 1 was now back on track 
the pact which grants independence to namibia from south africa 
and envisions a cuban pullout from angola was threatened by an 
incursion of 1200 to 1800 armed swapo guerrillas from their bases 
in angola 
its still fragile crocker said but he added that he was 
struck by the extent to which the cubans want to salvage this 
thing cuba has undertaken to remove an estimated 50000 troops 
from angola by july 1991 
crocker said the united states believes south africa too is 
determined to implement the agreements 
crocker said it was hard to explain the motive for the 
decision made by sam nujoma the head of the sovietbacked swapo 
group to violate the agreement which calls for the guerrillas to 
remain in angola until may 15 
it was a terrible decision from swapos own point of view 
crocker told reporters swapo sent 300 of its fighters to their 
death in namibia he said and i would have thought the 
leadership has something to answer for 
more than 260 swapo guerrillas have been killed in fighting with 
south africanled security forces since their incursion began april 
1 some observers have suggested that local swapo commanders 
thought they could return to namibia the moment the pact went into 
effect 
nujoma said initially that many of the fighters were already in 
namibia and had not crossed from angola but the un peacekeeping 
force on the ground has refuted the claim although nujoma has 
called on his fighters to retreat to angola it was unclear 
thursday how many had complied

neighbors say the family of the suspected cult 
leader implicated in a dozen gruesome slayings in mexico followed 
the santeria religion and practiced animal sacrifices at their 
suburban miami home 
but an anthropologist who studies santeria an afrochristian 
religion on thursday discounted its role in the ritual murders 
near matamoros mexico 
santeria is a largely underground religion that melded the 
beliefs of slaves from presentday nigeria with hispanic culture in 
the caribbean and parts of south america said mercedes sandoval a 
professor at miamidade community college who has studied santeria 
for nearly 40 years 
she estimated as many as 25000 people in south florida are 
santeria followers and they also can be found in new york new 
jersey california venezuela colombia and spain 
blood from santeria animal sacrifices can form an alliance with 
gods of nature and protect the believers a reason offered by 
mexican authorities as a motive for the killings at a ranch used by 
marijuana smugglers she said 
suspected cult leader adolfo de jesus constanzo may have been 
exposed to santeria and other magical systems ms sandoval said 
he probably was seeking assistance from magical systems to get 
protection and then he himself developed his own ritual 
constanzo grew up in dade county west of miami in a 
cubanamerican family that left headless chickens geese and goats 
animals used in santeria rituals on doorsteps and street 
corners in their middleclass neighborhood said neighbors 
constanzo lived in the area until 1984 
but ms sandoval said human sacrifice has never been a part of 
santeria practices she noted santeria symbols were present in the 
farm shack where investigators believe the victims were killed but 
pictures also revealed symbols such as human skulls used in the 
practice of palo mayombe a separate religion that has its origins 
in the congo 
i think i saw an ochosi on television reports on the 
slayings thats the god of hunting from west africa he is also 
perceived as the god that owns the traps she explained many 
people who are in conflict with the authorities pray to him to get 
them out of jail that is a connection with santeria 
even people who practice palo mayombe dont kill she said 
dr charles wetli dade county deputy chief medical examiner who 
has been studying afrocaribbean cults for more than 10 years 
agreed the basic tenets are not ones that encourage human 
sacrifice 
ms sandoval has contacted several santeros santeria priests 
in the miami area since the ritual aspect of the slayings became 
known but there was no indication constanzo had been initiated as 
a priest 
she suspected constanzo was dabbling in magical religions to 
terrorize his followers as a way of controlling them 
i think what we have here is a case of some very sociopathic 
people that may have been exposed to santeria or some other 
magical system ms sandoval said i think we are dealing with 
a deranged person 
willie ramos of miami a santeria priest who leads initiation 
ceremonies for new priests said he was infuriated by stories 
linking the mexican cult to the practice of santeria voodoo and 
other rituals with a base in the caribbean 
hes had some sort of exposure to santeria i wouldnt deny 
that but i wouldnt say hes a santeria priest ramos said of 
constanzo 
former neighbors recalled the constanzos as santeria followers 
and referred to constanzos mother as a witch 
they had sheep and chickens in the back yard said carmen 
reigada another neighbor they were troublemakers 
norma brito who bought the constanzos house after a bank 
foreclosed on it in 1984 said she found the remains of an altar 
with candles wax and fruit when she moved in 
law enforcement agencies in south florida refused to say whether 
any of constanzos relatives still live in the area 
a warning that constanzo mighting be heading for south florida 
is being read to metrodade officers at roll calls but at this 
time were not taking any active stance on it said detective

a senate committee on thursday approved 
legislation to give the television industry an antitrust exemption 
to adopt voluntary standards on portrayals of violence and drug use 
in tv entertainment programs 
the senate judiciary committee on a voice vote sent the 
measure to the full senate where a similar bill has passed twice 
only to die in the house at the end of previous sessions of 
congress 
the bill authored by sen paul simon dill was amended by 
the committee to also give the broadcast and cable industries and 
producers a threeyear exemption as with violence to develop 
standards on portrayals of drug use 
simon said there was overwhelming research evidence showing 
a link between excessive tv violence and childrens behavior he 
said he believed a way can be found for society to protect itself 
against undue emphasis on televised violence 
its time for the television industry to forge a partnership 
with americas familieis to scale back the atmosphere of violence 
that is erupting in our communities he said 
david carle an aide to simon said he hoped the change this 
year in the chairmanship of the house judiciary committee would 
help the bill in the house 
thenrep peter rodino dnj who had headed the panel until 
he retired last year may have been sensitive to opposition to the 
bill by the american civil liberties union though he never 
expressed it carle said 
barry lynn the aclus legislative counsel blasted the bill 
again thursday following the committee vote he called it a 
wholly inappropriate and unconstitutional effort to shape the 
content of american television 
there is nothing voluntary about guidelines which emerge from 
a regulated industry after congress has instructed it about 
specific programming it finds objectionable lynn said the 
hearing record of two past congresses is filled with evidence of 
precisely what programs and images the supporters of this measure 
want off the air including professional wrestling miami vice 
and saturday childrens cartoons 
lynn said the bill begins an endless cycle of congress using 
antitrust exemptions to supplant broadcasters and cable operators 
judgments about the images and ideas americans view 
but carle emphasized that any guidelines would be voluntary 
no network or individual station would be forced to adopt the 
standards if they were developed but we believe they would he 
said 
the national association of broadcasters did not have any 
immediate comment on thursdays action 
chris dunn general counsel to simon said the major television 
networks and motion picture producers did not oppose the previous 
bills but the networks said before that they didnt feel it was 
needed because they had standards and practices divsions dunn 
said 
but dunn said those standards and practices staffs have been 
cut way back in the past year he said the networks had not taken 
a position on the bill this year 
carle said the cable industry had been quite receptive to the 
proposal he said the reagan white house had supported the bill 
and we assume that will continue with the new administration 
nunn said the exemption would apply to general antitrust laws 
that would affect any industry he noted that the justice 
department in the 1970s had said the nabs television code that had 
influenced tv program content did not conform with antitrust laws 
and it was abandoned by the industry

south africa said thursday it may 
extend a deadline for guerrillas to report to un checkpoints for 
safe passage out of namibia 
by thursday night only five fighters of the southwest africa 
peoples organization had reported to un assembly points to take 
advantage of an offer to return safely to angola territorial 
officials said 
south africa says about 1900 guerrillas infiltrated northern 
namibia after april 1 when namibias transition to independence 
from south africa was to begin it was also the day a ceasefire 
between swapo and south african forces was to take effect 
but over the next eight days 263 guerrillas and 27 members of 
the south africanled security forces were killed in fighting 
south africas largest daily newspaper the star of 
johannesburg reported that two guerrillas were killed late 
wednesday in a new clash the first since the weekend a police 
spokesman chief inspector kierie du rand said he knew of no such 
incident 
un investigators have supported south africas contention the 
guerrillas violated a peace accord requiring they stay at angolan 
bases at least until may 15 
un and south african military officers have expressed concern 
that few guerrillas will report to the un checkpoints an 
undetermined number already have gone back into angola on their 
own and police say others are likely to try to remain in namibia 
in civilian guise 
the territorial police said they probably would begin tracking 
down guerrillas if it appeared only a few had left by a saturday 
deadline 
however south african foriegn minister pik botha said thursday 
the deadline could be extended indefinitely 
cedric thornberry secondincommand of the un contingent in 
namibia said verification of swapos withdrawal was a precondition 
for restoring the truce that was supposed to start april 1 
he said verification would be difficult because some guerrillas 
were bypassing the checkpoints and because of uncertainty as to the 
size of the original incursion 
swapos exiled president sam nujoma has called on his fighters 
to withdraw but he has not specifically advised that they report 
to the checkpoints 
south africa has ruled namibia since world war i in december 
it agreed to begin a transition to independence in exchange for 
cuba withdrawing its estimated 50000 troops from angola swapo has 
been fighting south african rule since 1966

the space program makes a profit and people who 
want it reduced in favor of more spending on food production and 
housing are ignorant of its benefits a soviet scientist said 
thursday 
boris chertok a member of the soviet academy of sciences said 
the program cost 2 billion last year but earned more than 32 
billion in satellite business and technology transfers his remarks 
were reported by the official news agency tass 
calls for reductions in the space budget emerged during the 
recent soviet election campaign they were brought up by official 
media wednesday in the context of cosmonauts day the anniversary 
of the first manned space flight made 28 years ago by yuri gagarin 
recent setbacks in the soviet space program encouraged the 
demands for reductions tass said wednesday the orbiting space 
station mir would be left unmanned for three months because of 
delays in preparing research modules 
late last month soviet scientists lost contact with the second 
of two phobos probes sent to mars at a cost of 480 million 
speaking at an academy of sciences convention chertok said 
demands to divert money from space to food production and housing 
reflect ignorance of the benefits space technology brings the 
national economy 
space research performed the role of locomotive which was 
blazing the way for other sectors tass quoted chertok as saying 
were it not for cosmonautics our lag in such fields as computer 
engineering would have been much greater than now 
he said the buran shuttle program criticized as uneconomical 
would help civil aviation and computer technology chertok said its 
safety systems could be applied in nuclear power engineering

sudanese rebels said thursday they have 
started shelling army garrisons in juba a city vital to a massive 
un emergency program to save 100000 people from starvation in 
the warwracked south 
however relief officials in nairobi said un personnel 
contacted by radio in juba reported no shelling by thursday 
afternoon the officials could not comment immediately on what 
effect if any the rebel claim could have on the relief effort 
in a broadcast monitored in nairobi the rebel radio of the 
sudan peoples liberation army said a longrange artillery 
bombardment of army garrisons in juba would last for four days the 
city is overcrowded with 300000 residents and war refugees 
jubas airstrip is part of the corridors of tranquillity 
organized by the united nations to stock 170000 tons of food and 
supplies in southern sudan before seasonal rains make roads 
impassable un officials warn that without such massive 
intervention 100000 people could die of starvation 
juba capital of sudans southernmost province of equatoria has 
remained in government hands throughout the sixyear war but 
frequently has come under rebel fire rebels led by useducated 
col john garang have been tightening their siege of the city 
throughout this year 
minority christian and animist rebels took up arms against the 
moslemdominated sudanese government in 1983 demanding autonomy 
and a larger share of sudans wealth and development for the south 
they have shot down civilian and relief planes and attacked 
truck train and barge convoys accusing the government of using 
them to ferry supplies to troops 
the international relief effort began april 1 after the sudanese 
government and the rebels agreed to let the emergency aid move 
unhampered to rebelcontrolled and governmentheld towns 
under the un program called operation lifeline 108 tons of 
food and supplies are being flown to juba on six daily flights from 
entebbe uganda 
nils enqvist the nairobibased deputy coordinator of the 
operation said by thursday afternoon he had heard no reports of 
shelling from juba but he said if the rebels bombard jubas 
airstrip they will break their agreement to allow the 132 million 
humanitarian effort to continue unhampered 
relief officials hope to avert a repat of the 1988 tragedy when 
some 250000 or more southern sudanese died from starvation due to 
flood drought or warinduced famine

raid triggering one of the bloodiest clashes in the 16month 
palestinian uprising at least five arabs were reported killed and 
dozens wounded 
elsewhere 16 palestinians were wounded by gunfire in 
confrontations with soldiers including five shot in bethlehem 
riots to protest the death of a teenager who was wounded last 
week hospital officials said

god is great police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd he 
said

a riot occurred in the mosque complex last friday first day of 
the moslem holy month of ramadan thousands of worshipers stoned 
police who replied with tear gas and rubber bullets more than a 
dozen people were hurt 
thursdays violence came as prime minister yitzhak shamir 
concluded a 10day visit to the united states where he proposed to 
president bush that elections be held in the occupied territories 
as a step toward peace 
maj gen amram mitzna the west bank army commander told 
reporters he ordered an investigation into the incident in nahalin 
about six miles southwest of bethlehem 
he said about 30 border police entered nahalin to search for 
palestinians who were ambushing passing jewish cars they 
encountered exceptional violence from about 100 arab youths 
mitzna said 
mitzna put the death toll at four and said at least 11 other 
palestinians suffered gunshot wounds in nahalin 
arab villagers who showed an associated press reporter fresh 
graves in the neighboring village of hussan said a fifth person 
from nahalin was shot and killed in hussan as he was driving to the 
funeral of the four slain residents 
an arab doctor in the village said six died the report could 
not be confirmed by the army or hospitals 
doctors in hospitals said dozens of villagers were treated and 
released fifteen were admitted two in critical condition with 
head wounds 
two hours of hitandrun stonethrowing attacks in bethlehem 
were sparked by the overnight death of 17yearold daoud khaled 
nasser he was wounded april 6 the day reporters saw soldiers open 
fire without warning on fleeing protesters in apparent violation of 
army regulations 
his death and the five in nahalin raised to 429 the number of

those killed said about a dozen jeeps of border police troops 
tried to enter the village about 430 am he said village youths 
blocked the roads with stones and threw rocks at soldiers who 
circumvented the barricades and entered on foot 
border police got on the roof and fired down on the people 
mohammed ali said as he waited for neighbors being treated at beit 
jalla hospital thats why there were so many head and chest 
wounds 
some villagers suggested jewish settlers were involved in the 
shooting but ali said he saw no civilians 
the nahalin death toll was the highest in a single incident 
since dec 16 1988 when four palestinians died in clashes that 
broke out at a funeral for a slain palestinian in the west bank 
city of nablus four other palestinians died later of wounds 
suffered at the funeral and subsequent clashes since named black 
friday by the arabs

immediate import restrictions have been 
ordered on eggs from countries where a food poisoning organism 
salmonella enteritidis has been found in poultry the agriculture 
department said thursday 
the organism also known as phagetype 4 bacterium has not been 
detected in the united states or canada said larry b slagle 
acting administrator of the departments animal and plant health 
inspection service 
but it has recently been identified as the cause of numerous 
outbreaks of salmonellosis in poultry in some areas of europe 
including the balkan countries and the iberian peninsula he said 
it has become the major sources of salmonellosis food 
poisoning in humans in england and wales slagle said it is 
known to be spread by poultry and poultry products including 
eggs 
ma mixson another agency official said he had no estimate of 
how many countries will be affected in any case he said 
relatively few eggs are imported into the united states so the 
us restrictions will have little impact 
in humans slagle said the salmonella bacteria can cause 
stomach cramps diarrhea fever and sometimes nausea and vomiting 
from five to 72 hours after they eat contaminated food 
slagle said the usda agency restrictions mean that eggs may be 
imported only if they meet certain conditions to ensure that they 
are free of diseases and if they are accompanied by a certificate 
which identifies the flock and country of origin the ports of 
embarkation and arrival and the name and address of the exporter 
and importer

the attorney general would define the scope of 
an independent counsels investigation and could intervene in court 
on legal issues under changes in the law proposed by president bush 
besides extending the independent counsel statute to members of 
congress as well as high executive branch officials suspected of 
wrongdoing the proposals contain a number of changes in the 
special prosecutor law 
bushs proposal would eliminate a controversial requirement that 
independent counsels issue reports detailing their decisions not to 
prosecute an official under investigation such as the lengthy 
document issued last year on thenattorney general edwin meese iii 
james c mckay the independent counsel who decided not to bring 
charges last year against meese drew criticism in legal circles 
when the special court released his highly critical report of the 
attorney general 
bushs plan would also empower the attorney general to define 
the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the independent counsel without 
any approval from the court that appoints the prosecutors 
according to a white house analysis of the proposals that was 
released wednesday 
under the current law the attorney general submits a proposed 
mandate to the special court which has the power to widen or 
narrow it 
in the case of the irancontra independent counsel the special 
court conferred a broader jurisdiction in its appointment of 
lawrence e walsh than was sought in late 1986 by meese 
meeses application called for an independent counsel to examine 
the diversion of usiran armssale profits 
following a request from several members of congress the 
special court issued a mandate that permitted walsh to delve into 
the full range of secret support the reagan administration had 
given the nicaraguan rebels at a time such aid was barred by 
congress 
fred wertheimer president of the citizen lobby group common 
cause said this proposal kind of cuts back on the basic purpose 
of the statute which was to get this outside of the ability of the 
justice department to control the investigation 
patti goldman an attorney for public citizen litigation group 
which supported the independent counsel when it was reviewed by the 
supreme court last year also criticized the proposal 
empowering the attorney general to set the jurisdiction gives 
him control to keep the independent counsel from looking into 
certain related things ms goldman said 
wertheimer predicted the proposals wouldnt be given serious 
consideration in congress which voted in late 1987 to 
reauthorize the law for five years 
under the bush proposal the special court would choose an 
independent counsel from a list of 15 qualified prosecutors 
submitted by the attorney general it has authority to appoint any 
qualified attorney under the current law 
the proposal would include a provision that the independent 
counsel does not have authority to act for the attorney general 
with respect to any matter which by law requires the persona action 
of the attorney general according to the white house summary 
it also empowers the attorney general or the solicitor general 
to intervene to address a matter of law in a case involving an 
independent counsel rather than as a friend of the court 
in the early stages of the oliver north trial us district 
judge gerhard a gesell ruled that the independent counsel not 
the attorney general could speak for the bush administration in 
court on national security matters 
gesell rebuked the justice department for trying to intervene 
saying they could only the independent counsel could represent the 
government in the case 
wertheimer and goldman both defended the reporting provision of 
the current law saying it ensures accountability to both the 
special court and the public 
the reports are necessary wertheimer said because we are 
dealing with special circumstances including the public 
credibility of the investigation 
the white house summary said eliminating the reporting provision 
would protect an official under investigation from unwarranted 
speculation about crimes for which he or she will not be indicted 
this provision is consistent with longstanding prosecutorial 
practice in which ordinary federal prosecutors do not explain 
their decisions not to bring criminal charges

president bush said thursday that saudi arabia 
does not possess nuclear chemical or biological warheads for 
intermediaterange ballistic missiles purchased from china 
if bush had found otherwise the administration would have been 
barred from selling certain military products to the saudis 
in a formal presidential certification bush said the saudis 
have bought intermediaterange missiles from china but there is 
no credible intelligence reporting indicating that saudi arabia 
possesses nuclear chemical or biological weapons 
moreover he said we are not aware of production facilities 
for chemical or biological agents or weapons he said the saudis 
possess no significant nuclear facilities 
a law enacted by congress requires the president to make a 
certification about the saudis arsenal in order to continue 
military sales 
bush said that both the saudis and chinese have informed the 
united states the missiles purchased from beijing will not be 
equipped with nuclear warheads 
the saudis also have pledged the missiles will not be armed with 
chemical warheads bush said 
we remain concerned about the possible proliferation of these 
types of weapons in the middle east and will continue to watch 
developments closely bush said he promised to notify congress 
of any change in developments in saudi arabia

president bushs nominee as ambassador to 
japan on thursday denied assertions in the irancontra trial that 
he took part in a 1985 meeting where it was decided to reward 
honduras for backing the contra guerrillas 
a document released in the oliver north trial said that michael 
h armacost undersecretary of state in the second reagan 
administration attended a meeting of a crisis preplanning group 
at the white house on feb 7 1985 at which it was decided to 
release military aid to honduras in return for that nations 
continuing backing for the contras 
i read that in the paper with utter bewilderment 
armacost told a senate foreign relations committee hearing on his 
nomination as ambassador to tokyo 
i did not attend that meeting on the 7th of february at the 
white house i am unable to reconstruct what they are talking 
about said armacost 
the feb 7 1985 meeting had not been disclosed in 
investigations of the irancontra affair until the introduction at 
the north trial of a 42page admission of quid pro quo arrangements 
that the reagan administration reached with other countries 
evidence previously disclosed in the irancontra investigations 
said that armacost and thensecretary of state george p shultz had 
raised objections to the secret sale of arms to iran 
north a fired white house aide is on trial for his role in 
arranging the arms sale to iran and diverting the profits to the 
contra guerrillas who were battling the leftist government of 
nicaragua 
sen alan cranston dcalif who presided over the armacost 
hearing asked armacost to respond in writing to information on his 
role that was contained in the document that the bush 
administration submitted as stipulated evidence in the north trial 
bush last week refused to comment on another portion of the 
document that said he informed the honduran president roberto 
suazo cordova that thenpresident reagan had directed expedited 
delivery of us military items to honduras in 1985 
bushs meeting took place shortly after reagan approved slipping 
more than 100 million in extra aid to honduras in exchange for 
that countrys support of the contras 
cranston said he expected the committee to approve armacosts 
nomination and send it to the floor of the senate for a vote before 
congress enters a recess next wednesday

firing up the shoreham nuclear plant on long 
island and the seabrook facility in new hampshire would be a 
solution to projected power shortages in the northeast an energy 
department official said thursday 
deputy secretary w henson moore of the energy department 
testifying before the senate energy committee on the electricity 
supply and demand outlook for the northeast said that were 
holding two birds in our hands and were about to let them go in 
hopes of finding one in the bush 
moore called new englands energy outlook troubling because 
reserve margins there could fall below acceptable levels as early 
as 1993 if the recent robust demand growth continues 
if either demand growth exceeds projections as it has over the 
last two years or if new capacity including seabrook does not 
come on line as planned the situation in new england will be 
exacerbated and reserve margins could fall below acceptable levels 
as early as 1991 or 1992 he said 
the energy situation in new york is generally good with the 
exception of long island he added 
if the long island lighting cos peak demand grows by 4 
percent this year as it has averaged for the past six years 
lilcos reserve margin would fall below 18 percent this year he 
said 
but peter bradford chairman of the new york state public 
service commission testified that shoreham would not have been a 
great asset to the long island power supply situation in the near 
future 
the fairest summary seems to be that if shoreham ran well and 
if oil prices rose rapidly there might come a time when in the 
next century it would be to the customers net economic 
advantage he said on the other hand if oil prices remain 
stable in real terms and shoreham performs as erratically as many 
nuclear plants it would never be an asset economically on long 
island 
moore said the energy department would do everything in its 
power to block the decommissioning of the shoreham plant 
we intend to throw up every roadblock we can find to do it 
moore said after the hearing and if we have to create some 
well do that 
asked what the department had in mind he said we dont know 
were still looking at those opportunities those alternatives we 
think it would just be foolhardy to decommission it 
moore said hed rather see the 54 billion plant mothballed so 
shoreham will have another chance to operate later 
when all the political rhetoric has died down and all the 
hyperopponents of nuclear power have gone their way and found some 
other plant to demonstrate against theyll start relooking at 
those things and they will decide and tell their public officials 
theyd like to have a reconsideration of this decision moore 
told reporters

ecology and politics shared the stage 
thursday as participants in a symposium on the future of 
yellowstone national park that rekindled the debate that arose 
during the historic fires of 1988 
the fires that charred about 1 million acres of the nations 
first national park drew attention to the shortcomings of 
management plans in the park and surrounding national forests 
the attention of the world conservation community is focused 
on the park yellowstone superintendent bob barbee told the 
participants in the university of wyoming conference 
his goal is to develop a more ambitious control of the ecosystem 
to oversee both the park and the forests 
barbee said the managers of the greater yellowstone area must 
concentrate on protecting the areas natural resources while 
maintaining the economic activities in the forests 
these are easy things to say theyre hard things to 
achieve barbee said our job is to cast a vote for posterity 
he noted that this weeks conference may not offer any 
solutions about 300 people from across the nation came to wyoming 
to present research papers debate and listen to speakers 
wyoming gov mike sullivan started the discussion on a political 
note 
he said cooperation among state and federal agencies in managing 
and promoting yellowstone is being sorely tested by a bush 
administration proposal to fund last summers firefighting efforts 
with the states share of federal mineral royalties 
bluntly stated this idea is feudalism and not federalism 
western states are not vassals on some vast medieval estate owned 
by absentee landlords in washington but this proposal would treat 
us as such sullivan said 
the governor said he has urged this illconceived idea be 
reconsidered 
brian stout supervisor of the bridgerteton national forest 
agreed that state officials need to be more involved in planning 
the future of the greater yellowstone area 
he said the many different demands on the federal land in 
northwestern wyoming make it tough to plan ahead 
it is the diversity of demands upon this that are creating the 
conflicts stout said conflicts arent going to go away 
because we are not creating any more acres 
stout said he does not agree with some groups that say the 
yellowstone area should have one management plan currently there 
are many government mandates controlling the use of public land in 
the area 
stout said diversity is necessary because the variety of land 
demands different management plans strong coordination efforts 
will be the key to better management he said 
last summers fires brought the worlds attention on the fact 
that coordination has not been as effective as it should be stout

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
thursday that the united states will continue its dialogue with the 
palestine liberation organization despite statements by some plo 
elements which appear to challenge israels right to exist 
he also told a senate appropriations subcommittee that the 
willingness of israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir to consider 
holding elections in occupied palestinian territories followed by 
negotiations leading to a permanent settlement is a new and 
hopeful idea which should be fully explored 
sen warren rudman rnh read several recent statements by 
plo officials which he said seemed to suggest they remain committed 
to the creation of a palestinian state and the destruction of 
israel 
statements such as those are clearly not helpful baker 
said we do look at statements such as that very carefully 
because we want to continue the dialogue with the plo under the 
conditions under which they were started 
but he said that the plo is composed of many dissident 
elements some of which are opposed to any dialogue with the united 
states and some which have not renounced terrorism 
to date we are satisfied that the plo is committed to what it 
has told us that it recognizes israels right to exist and that it 
has renounced terrorism in all of its forms baker said 
baker said shamirs willingness to hold elections in the 
occupied west bank and gaza to choose representatives to open 
negotiations with israel is new different and significant 
he also noted that shamir said all options would be considered 
in the structure of transitional and permanent arrangements 
we think this is progress baker said it is a useful 
first step it should be explored it should not be rejected 
categorically out of hand 
he said the united states will encourage shamir egyptian 
president hosni mubarak and jordans king hussein to preserve 
flexibility so that the options may be explored and if possible 
capitalized upon 
elections are an important political act that can launch a 
process leading to negotiations on both transitional and final 
status issues baker said 
responding to questions baker said it would be difficult to 
conduct elections if the violence associated with the palestinian 
uprising in the occupied territories continues 
surely there has to be a greater degree of calm or tranquility 
before you get to elections he said 
meanwhile 38 senators told baker in a letter that they would 
seriously consider withholding us financial support for the 
united nations if the plo were recogized as a memberstate by 
the world body 
the senators told baker they viewed such a move with alarm and 
that it sets the stage for continued stalemate on the 
arabisraeli issue 
the group led by sen robert w kasten jr rwis urged baker 
to use every means at your disposal to discourage the drive 
elsewhere thursday israel and the plo jockeyed for position 
with shamir refusing to follow palestinian official nabil shaath in 
appearances before a meeting of american newspaper editors so 
organizers changed the schedule with shamir speaking first and 
shaaths appearance was delayed 
shaath political adviser to plo chairman yasser arafat told 
the editors he did not mind appearing after shamir 
shaath said the usplo dialogue demonstrated close 
proximity in their positions shaath said the plo has accepted 
that a palestinian state would consist only of the west bank and 
gaza adding that its a bitter pill for us but a concession 
that israel should accept 
as for shamirs proposal for elections shaath called it an 
exhilirating idea for palestinians but he rejected any elections 
which would bar plo participation and be held under israeli 
occupation 
shamir asked whether he would allow international supervision 
of such elections and would let plo members hold office if elected 
said such issues would have to be worked out by a ministerial 
committee he sted the plo had not relinquished a dream of 
eventually setting up a state that would include israel itself 
saying shaath and other plo leaders were conciliatory and moderate 
when dealing with westerners but take a hard line when speaking to 
the arab world maybe they want peace but not with us he said 
bakers chief deputy meantime told a jewish audience the plo 
may be sincere in its declaration that it no longer seeks to 
destroy israel 
the evidence is mixed deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger told leaders of the united jewish appeal 
historically there can be no issue that was the object of the 
plo he said 
at the moment the jury is out eagleburger said when asked 
at a luncheon whether he believed statements by arafat in december 
that the organization supported israels right to exist 
there are questions that need to be answered it is no longer 
clear in either direction said eagleburger traditionally a 
strong supporter of israel 
eagleburger also said the united states was not trying to 
mediate between the plo and israel discussions with the plo he 
said are an attempt to encourage arafats organization to take 
constructive steps to allow a process between israel and 
palestinians on the west bank and in gaza to develop 
we will get a better fix on the plos intentions he said

a man who escaped from the maze 
prison in a 1983 ira breakout was extradited from the irish 
republic to northern ireland by helicopter thursday to avoid an 
antiextradition protest at the border 
an irish republican army statement took responsibility for a car 
bomb that exploded next to a police station this week killing a 
woman and said the explosion may have been premature 
paul kane 34 was only the fifth man extradited from the 
republic to northern ireland since the ira began fighting in august 
1969 to unite the predominantly protestant british province with 
the republic which is overwhelmingly roman catholic 
he was driven in a police convoy from topsecurity portlaoise 
prison 50 miles from dublin to the irish armys curragh camp and 
taken by army helicopter to within a mile of the border he was 
quickly transferred to a northern ireland police helicopter which 
flew him to belfast 
kane was charged thursday night in belfast crown court with 
escaping from the maze and other crimes 
the helicopter transfer enabled police to avoid 200 
antiextradition campaigners who waited at the border for more than 
24 hours to protest members of sinn fein the legal wing of the 
outlawed ira demonstrated at portlaoise as kane was driven away 
he was arrested in the republic in november 1987 and had 
resisted british attempts at extradition kane was serving 18 years 
for ira activities after conviction on the evidence of an informer 
christopher black 
when the convictions resulting from blacks testimony were 
quashed after the maze breakout kane claimed he had been wrongly 
imprisoned but he still faced the escape charge 
he was one of 38 men who fled the maze on sept 25 1983 a 
guard was stabbed to death and another was shot and seriously 
wounded 
in its claim of responsibility for the wednesday bombing the 
ira offered sincere apologies to the family of 20yearold 
joanne reilly a roman catholic killed by the explosion in 
warrenpoint less than a mile from the border 
miss reilly worked in a hardware store next to the police 
station and was hit with the full force of the bomb which wounded 
31 civilians and nine police officers police said they believe it 
contained 1500 pounds of explosives 
officials said more than 2oo homes were damaged 
the ira killed 18 british army soldiers in an ambush outside 
warrenpoint on aug 27 1979 that same day an ira bomb on his 
yacht killed lord louis mountbatten indias last viceroy and a 
cousin of queen elizabeth ii

the average american will have to labor 124 
days this year just to pay federal state and local taxes reaching 
tax freedom day on may 4 the tax foundation said thursday 
that is the same number of days of work required to meet tax 
obligations in the last two years and the same as in 1981 when 
acrosstheboard cuts in federal taxes were enacted tax freedom 
day has never been later 
from another perspective the average worker will have to 
toil two hours and 43 minutes each eighthour day to satisfy the 
tax collectors one minute more than last year 
americans are no better off than they were in 1981 
despite economic growth cuts in income tax rates and repeated 
claims that government spending has been cut to the bone the 
foundation said 
economists at the foundation a washingtonbased nonpartisan 
research organization attributed the lack of progress to 
the 1986 tax reform act which took away or reduced several 
deductions to finance lower rates and tax increases enacted in 
1982 and 1984 although the big 1986 overhaul meant lower rates for 
most individuals in many cases the reduced rates were more than 
offset by loss of deductions 
social security taxes have grown faster than the economy in the 
1980s in 1981 a worker paid social security tax of 665 percent of 
the first 29700 earned or a 1975 tax this year the tax is 
751 percent of the first 48000 or a maximum 3605 
state and local taxes have risen steadily through the decade 
in part to pay for a reduction in federal programs 
meantime a group opposing any excisetax increase to cut the 
budget deficit released a study indicating that over the past 10 
years the share of all federal taxes falling on the poor has risen 
by 12 percent while the burden on upperincome americans has 
dropped by 43 percent 
the 50 percent of taxpayers considered to have middle income 
between 20000 and 60000 saw a 34 percent rise in their share 
of the burden those with incomes under 20000 constitute about 
onethird of the population those over 60000 about onesixth 
the coalition against regressive taxation whose members include 
state and local government officials truckers and the tobacco and 
alcohol industries said any increase in taxes on gasoline 
cigarettes wine liquor or beer would worsen that disparity since 
excise levies are acknowledged to fall more heavily on those with 
less income 
tax foundation economists calculate tax freedom day by summing 
up the total of taxes collected by federal state and local 
governments including those paid by businesses and dividing that 
amount among workers if every dollar earned this year were claimed 
by governments until all taxes were paid the average worker would 
be paid up by quitting time on may 4 
at this time last year the foundation forecast a 1988 tax 
freedom day of may 5 which would have been the latest ever 
economists now have looked back over the year and recalculated that 
last years date was may 3 but 1988 was a leap year meaning the 
average worker had to put in 124 days on the job to pay taxes the 
same as is projected for this year 
the foundation has calculated tax freedom day all the way back 
to 1930 when the magic date was feb 13 it reached april 3 in 
1950 april 28 in 1970 and may 1 in 1980 the earliest date in this 
decade was april 28 1984 
federal taxes will take one hour and 47 minutes out of the 
average workers eighthour day this year up one minute from last 
year state and local taxes will claim 56 minutes same as a year 
ago 
the rest of the work day will be spent this year paying for 
housing one hour and 25 minutes up one minute food and tobacco 59 
minutes up a minute transportation 40 cents unchanged medical 
care 39 minutes unchanged clothing 24 minutes up one minute 
recreation 20 minutes down two minutes and all other including 
education savings and religion 50 minutes down two minutes

president bush proposed a partial 
deregulation of education thursday saying schools in poorer 
communities would be given more flexibility in how they may spend 
government money 
aides said bushs proposal an expansion of the package he 
announced last week would result in the elimination of burdensome 
federal regulations 
bush speaking at an education conference at union high school 
sought to build public support for his education package while 
renewing his argument that more money from the government will not 
necessarily improve educational performance 
we need to rely less on the collective wallet and more on our 
collective will he said 
bush who campaigned on a theme of wanting to be the education 
president last week proposed 441 million in new spending for 
school programs but without spelling out where the money would 
come from 
overall bushs budget would freeze federal spending on many 
education programs it calls for total education spending of 219 
billion the same level sought by former president reagan in his 
fiscal 1990 budget 
bushs proposals include awards and grants to outstanding 
schools and teachers an expanded program of magnet schools that 
focus on curriculum specialties and more funds for historically 
black colleges the plan has been criticzed as inadequate by 
congressional democrats 
bush told his audience we want to help those most in need 
targeting federal resources where they can do the most good 
we want to waive some regulations for poorer communities 
allowing them to pool state and federal funds in exchange for 
higher accountability and performance a kind of 
performancedriven partial deregulation of education if you 
will 
well give you the flexibility you show us the results 
bush told a cheering audience of educators and students 
education secretary lauro f cavazos told reporters on air force 
one that the administration would seek to relax regulations to 
get funds to local schools without a lot of paperwork and a lot of 
bureaucracy 
in essence it is a type of deregulation cavazos said he 
said however that it would not represent a return to block grants 
to schools abandoned during the reagan administration 
he also said that while poor communities would be the first to 
benefit from the relaxation in federal regulations the flexibility 
would eventually be extended to other communities as well 
on his way to the speech bushs motorcade made an unannounced 
stop at hamilton school where the president greeted gina marie 
sisco a sixthgrade student who had written him a letter 
she was among a group of flagwaving students clustered on the 
curb outside the school 
in the letter a portion of which bush later read during his 
speech the young correspondent said only students who had won an 
academic fitness award had been invited to the presidents speech 
i am a resource room student for math and english i have a 
learning disability there are many kids like me and we all have to 
work harder than most kids she wrote 
bush praised miss sisco saying its excellence and its hard 
work 
barbara bush attended the speech and was given a rousing 
applause when her husband introduced her 
she got a good clean bill of health yesterday from walter reed 
army hospital bush said mrs bush received a radioactive iodine 
treatment at the hospital to deal with a thyroid problem 
in his speech bush said of money and education a nation that 
worships money or sees money as a cure for all that ails it is 
a society in peril 
more spending isnt the only right answer or even the best 
answer he said what we need is better value for what we 
spend what we need is a shared determination on the part of 
every american to get involved with our schools we must 
reestablish the value of teaching and learning in this country 
bushs partial deregulation plan closely follows 
recommendations that were made to him after the election by the 
rochester nybased national center on education and the economy 
headed by apple computer chairman john sculley 
the group has proposed waiving red tape and regulations in favor 
of innovative local plans approved by state and federal 
governments freedom from the rules would continue as long as 
students met the performance targets set in the plans as 
envisioned by the center the experiments would be used later as 
models to revamp federal programs 
sculley said last month that bush had been extremely 
interested in what we had to say at a meeting in december both

two members of congress introduced legislation 
thursday urging creation of a voluntary community service program 
increasing gi bill benefits and calling on the bush 
administration to develop a mandatory national service plan 
sen john mccain rariz and rep john porter rill said 
that although eight other national service measures exist their 
bill addresses the true concept of national service 
there are those of us congressman porter and myself who 
believe all americans should serve their country that is the basic 
linchpin of this legislation mccain told a news conference 
the main aspect of the bill is the mandatory service proposal 
that includes parttime and fulltime community service programs as 
well as fulltime service in the active reserve or national guard 
elements of the armed forces or service in the coast guard 
i realize that will be roundly criticized in some sectors of 
our society but i think the worse thing was the injustice 
perpetrated during the vietnam war mccain said we asked a 
certain economic level of our society to serve and allowed another 
economic level of our society to remain at home 
mccain fought in vietnam and spent 5 12 years as a prisoner of 
war 
under the parttime community service program volunteers will 
serve 24 hours per month and two weeks during the year service 
will be two to four years 
current gi bill benefits would be raised from 10800 to 
15120 for active duty members and could be used for education 
vocational training or toward the purchase of a first primary 
residence 
the programs costs according to the legislation must fall 
within existing budgets the initial cost of the community service 
program is 250 million with states providing the full matching 
funds increases in the gi bill will be part of the defense 
department budget 
porter said the legislation would provide the groundwork for a 
resurgence in national service by encouraging young americans to 
make a commitment to their country

soviet military advisers helped their north 
vietnamese allies shoot down american airplanes with missiles 
during the vietnam war the soviet defense ministry newspaper 
reported thursday 
red star carried a series of reminiscences that were believed to 
be the first direct admission that soviet military advisers engaged 
in combat in the war 
the newspapers disclosures were typical of the greater openness 
by the soviet military under president mikhail s gorbachev but 
they sounded a jarring note at a time when improved superpower 
relations have brought more sympathetic coverage of the united 
states by staterun media 
red star said it was printing the reminiscences in response to 
requests from readers 
with three missiles we brought down four planes said sgt 
n kolesnik recalling a july night in 1965 when the troops he was 
advising set up an antiaircraft battery near a ruined town that 
american pilots used for target practice 
all of us worked well kolesnik said naming fellow soviets 
he called the targeting officer the computation commander the 
operator and other soldiers at the firing stations 
later kolesnik said the vietnamese the soviets were training 
set up wooden decoys of missiles after bombing the decoys to no 
avail the departing american planes ran into the enemy field of 
fire and three skyhawks were downed kolesnik said 
the soviets began training vietnamese rocket troops in spring of 
1965 gen maj g belov told red star 
the soldiers recollections mainly concerned training vietnamese 
to work with zenith missiles and the battle to keep technologically 
ahead of the americans 
the us forces changed their schedule of air sorties after the 
soviets arrived according to excerpts from the diary of col g 
lyubinetsky previously they had flown on a regular schedule with 
breaks and predictable days off 
but after the soviet specialists arrived they realized that 
they had to take the rocket forces seriously lyubinetsky wrote 
col v fyodorov recalled that in 1966 when a vietnamese 
division was running a battle independently already without the 
participation of our specialists it brought down an american 
plane and the captured pilot refused to believe that the vietnamese 
had acted on their own 
i dont believe you he said when he was assured the 
vietnamese were responsible something smells russian here 
during an unspecified period of battle while the soviet regiment 
was in action 43 missiles brought down 23 american planes 
fyodorov said 
belov said soviets died in vietnam but did not say how many 
one officer recalled being personally thanked for soviet aid by 
north vietnamese leader ho chi minh and another said he saw a 
soviet soldier throw himself on a bomb to save a young vietnamese 
girl 
when two soviet technicians were leaving for home vietnamese 
officers and soldiers were practically crying and walked a long 
way behind their departing car calling linso linso the 
vietnamese word for soviet maj gen a trombachev said 
thats how friendly you can get in eight months he said 
a recent article in red star described soviet missile 
specialists work in the middle east and an editors note 
accompanying thursdays article said readers also had asked for 
information on soviet troops in syria and north korea

city workers protested for a third day 
thursday in an attempt to prevent layoffs of more than onethird of 
elizabeths public safety employees including all ambulance 
workers 
about 75 police officers firefighters and emergency medical 
workers gathered thursday outside the springfield campaign office 
of assembly speaker chuck hardwick a candidate for governor 
elizabeth mayor thomas dunn who took to carrying a pistol after 
a rowdy postmidnight rally by about 200 city employees outside his 
house has blamed hardwick for the citys budget shortfall 
dunn said the speaker will not put up for a vote a 
distressedcities bill that could ease the budget problems for this 
workingclass city of 106000 people 
most of the 221 layoffs are scheduled for friday including 82 
police officers 68 firefighters and all 38 of the citys ambulance 
workers 
on may 29 19 more police and 14 additional firefighters are set 
to be cut leaving 232 people in the police department and 192 in 
the fire department 
i dont believe this city can survive with the cuts said 
paul partazana president of the elizabeth police benevolent 
association this city cant be declared safe with that amount of 
police officers left behind to protect it 
partazana said the safety workers would continue protesting but 
a superior court judge has issued orders limiting the gatherings 
the protesters stayed outside dunns house until about 130 am 
wednesday singing songs filled with expletives and chanting save 
our jobs dunn said a dead fish was thrown on his porch 
later that morning the protest moved to the house of john f 
papetti city business administrator and the injunction 
prohibiting protests outside elected officials houses was 
requested and granted 
also on wednesday about 150 of the workers scheduled for 
layoffs filled the city hall lobby to sign up for unemployment 
benefits 
papetti said garbage disposal costs have tripled from about 4 
million to about 12 million in one year because of new state 
environmental regulations and that distressedcity money dropped 
from about 10 million to about 7 million during the same period 
the state says to go pay for these things survive but nobody 
says how papetti said 
the states distressedcities fund was cut to 70 million this 
year from 120 million last year gov tom kean recently proposed a 
compromise that would supply an additional 65 million but speaker 
hardwick has criticized the measure as a disguised tax increase 
another 150 people are scheduled for layoffs friday from other 
city departments

president bush has selected eddie brown the 
first indian to head a major state agency in arizona to oversee 
the operation of the troubleplagued bureau of indian affairs the 
white house announced thursday 
brown the former director of the arizona department of economic 
security and a member of the pascua yaqui tribe will be nominated 
as assistant secretary for indian affairs at the interior 
department 
interior secretary manuel lujan said brown has a broad 
background in intergovernmental relations with native americans 
as well as prior experience with the bureau where he was a 
division chief in 1985 
as the top interior department official specifically in charge 
of indian affairs brown will oversee an agency that has been the 
subject of sharp congressional criticism in recent months because 
of alleged improprieties involving the bia and other indian matters 
eddie will make an excellent assistant secretary sen john 
mccain rariz said in a statement i can think of no one more 
highly qualified for the bia spot and i commend this appointment 
very highly 
however the arizona senates republican leader john mawhinney 
of tucson had a mixed view if the job calls for somebody with 
an extraordinary understanding of assorted indian tribes then 
hes an excellent choice but if theyre looking for someone with 
very strong managerial and supervisory skills i think theyve got 
the wrong man 
brown 43 drew praise during six years as an assistant director 
of the states department of economic security for reshaping the 
states contractual relations with tribal governments in what 
became a national model he also won respect of indian leaders and 
federal officials as director of the bias socialservices division 
in 1985 and 1986 
but appointed the head of the arizona department in january 
1987 by thengov evan mecham he ran into complaints from 
legislators and others that he was in over his head as the top man 
complaints concerned delayed payments to vendors and delayed 
services to department clients and costly mixups in how state and 
federal funds were used one delay lost the department 44 million 
in federal funds 
the bia is the arm of the interior department that oversees 
indian welfare education natural resources and economic growth 
its programs and policies affect more than 14 milion indians and 
alaska natives 
the position of bia commisioner is vacant and brown as 
assistant secretary for indian affairs will oversee the bureaus 
operations 
the bia has been under sharp criticism in congress where a 
senate select committee has held a series of hearings that 
disclosed cases of fraud mafia infiltration and child sexual 
abuses on indian reservations under the eyes of the federal agency 
mccain and other senators including sen dennis deconcini 
dariz who have been involved in the hearings have said the 
findings make clear the bureau is in need of major overhaul 
the bia has been grossly negligent in protecting the resource 
that american indians care about most deeply their families 
deconcini said after the conclusion of the recent set of hearings 
in february which included one session about sexual abuse among 
indian children 
the select senate committee on indian affairs plans additional 
hearings later in the year on other subjects affecting indians 
including natural resource management indian health services and 
housing programs and education all of which the bia has been 
accused of not overseeing adequately 
in other interior department appointments 
frank a bracken a muncie ind business executive will be 
nominated as undersecretary of interior bracken is the board 
chairman of ballincon glass packaging corp in muncie 
martin l allday of midland texas will be nominated as the

direct peace talks between the foreign 
ministers of iran and iraq will resume april 20 eight months to 
the day after a ceasefire took effect in the 8yearold war un 
officials said thursday 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar will mediate the talks 
in geneva between ali akbar velayati of iran and tariq aziz of 
iraq un spokesman francois giuliani said 
he read a statement from perez de cuellar urging both nations to 
show more flexibility in the talks which have been stalled almost 
since they began aug 25 five days after the truce 
it suggested the secretarygeneral would press iraq to withdraw 
from the iranian territory occupied in the last days of fighting 
and urge iran to cooperate in clearing the shattalarab iraqs 
only sea outlet the border waterway closed early in the war is 
clogged with sunken ships and silt 
the secretarygeneral and his special representative have 
emphasized the need for withdrawal without delay to the 
internationally recognized boundaries the release and repatriation 
of the prisoners of war and the speedy beginning of the mediation 
efforts for a peace agreement said the statement read by 
giuliani 
iraq occupies at least 260 square miles of iranian territory 
according to un estimates iran has said withdrawal must be 
accomplished before prisoners are repatriated or other issues are 
discussed 
pragmatic arrangements particularly with regard to the 
economic life of the two countries may well be needed to hasten 
the return to normality the statement said in apparent reference 
to iraqs demand that the shatt be cleared 
perez de cuellar will be in geneva on april 1925 as part of a 
european tour his special representative for the peace talks 
swedish un ambassador jan k eliasson will accompany him to the

congress is ready to assume federal guidance 
of the telephone industry with legislation that would spur new 
technologies and make sure consumers dont foot the bill rep john 
dingell said thursday 
the michigan democrat in an address to an audience of telephone 
company executives said the industry wont like everything 
congress is going to do on telecommunications issues this year 
that lawmakers will not satisfy the corporate protagonists in 
this debate 
it will include provisions that one side will say are 
unnecessary and the other will decry as insufficient said 
dingell who is chairman of the house energy and commerce committee 
that deals with telephone issues 
but he said it was time congress lifted current restrictions on 
the bell operating companies that limit their ability to grow and 
their ability to bring new products and services to the american 
marketplace 
dingell said he wants to return to congress the ability to 
oversee the development of the telecommunications industry end 
restrictions that constrain technological development and deprive 
users of access to products and services and protect residential 
subscribers from paying for the competitive ventures of the 
telephone companies 
he said existing telecommunications policy under congress the 
courts and the federal communications commission is ad hoc and 
uncoordinated it makes no sense 
us district court judge harold greene dingell said has been 
faced with an impossible situation in his effort to oversee the 
modification of final judgment under which american telephone amp 
telegraph co split off the regional phone companies in 1984 
the regional companies were prohibited from entering the 
longdistance manufacturing or information services marketplaces 
greenes dilemma dingell said is to watch out for possible 
antitrust violations by the powerful telephone companies while at 
the same time recognizing the impact of his decisions on 
international trade universal telephone service and us 
competitiveness in information technologies 
the more the judge takes these factors into account the more 
he usurps the authorities of the congress dingell said he can 
properly limit his purview to questions of antitrust and end up 
with decisions that are not in the larger national interest 
dingell cited a recent decision by greene to allow one of the 
seven regional bell companies pacific telesis to participate in a 
transpacific telephone cable project 
he said the judges decision repeatedly addresses the foreign 
trade aspects of pac tels participation and concludes that the 
benefits outweigh any potential antitrust concerns 
dingell said congress or an agency overseen by congress should 
be making such decisions 
it is not my purpose to criticize the judge for that decision 
my purpose is simply to point out that he is in an impossible 
position dingell said 
it is time for congress to legislate the structure of the 
american telecommunications industry and permit judge green to 
return to his other duties and obligations 
dingell said reps al swift dwash and tom tauke riowa 
were putting final touches on such legislation and it would be 
introduced next week

israels ambassador to the united states 
clashed thursday with the american society of newspaper editors in 
an incident reflecting the intractability of the arabisraeli 
conflict 
ambassador moshe arad accused james squires editor of the 
chicago tribune and one of the organizers of the annual asne 
meeting of seeking to embarrass israel by inviting a plo 
representative to address the convention along with prime minister 
yitzhak shamir 
shamir spoke to the group earlier thursday and was followed less 
than two hours later by nabil shaath the political adviser to 
palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat 
originally shamir was scheduled to make a backtoback 
appearance after shaath but organizers rescheduled at the last 
minute to accomodate the israelis desire that shamir and shaath 
not bump into each other squires said in an interview 
squires said he was quite astonished to hear from arad that 
shamir could not appear on the same day as shaath but he 
nonethless assured the ambassador he would do all he could to 
prevent any meeting between the two men or their security details 
he conceded he had told arad he might be able to move shaaths 
appearance to the following day although he did not know if the 
palestinians schedule would permit such a change 
arad said squires had promised to try and schedule any plo 
speaker for the following day and i am deeply dismayed by this 
breach of commitment on your behalf 
arad said squires had failed to inform him until this week of 
the invitation extended to the plo and an attempt to put them on 
the same platform in direct sequence to each other reflected an 
attempt to embarrass us 
arad said he could not imagine that squires had not known 
shaath would appear so closely following shamir and still you 
preferred to withhold this information i find the entire handling 
of the invitation most inappropriate and unethical 
squires insisted that arad was given no misleading 
information about the speaking engagements saying its 
ridiculous for them to dictate to us how we run our meeting 
its none of mr arads business who we choose to invite to 
the asne meeting squires said its exactly the kind of 
absurdity that this middle east conflict is producing

the government on thursday announced that 
burma and the central african republic because of violations of 
worker rights are being dropped from a program offering developing 
nations dutyfree entry of goods into the united states 
at the same time us trade representative carla hills said her 
office had rejected requests that israel and malaysia be denied the 
benefits of the generalized system of preferences program because 
of allegations about similar violations 
in israels case the government investigated complaints from 
the american arab antidiscrimination committee that arabs from the 
west bank and gaza who travel to work in israel are denied certain 
rights and receive less wages and benefits than do other israeli 
workers 
the ustr declined to revoke israels trade benefits saying the 
country was taking steps to afford internationally recognized 
worker rights 
the government also refused to investigate the american arab 
groups allegations that palestinians working inside the occupied 
territories are being discriminated against saying the west bank 
and gaza are not legally considered part of israel 
faris bouhafa a spokesman for the american arab group said his 
organization was pleased that steps apparently are being taken to 
correct violations within israel and with the finding that the 
territories are not part of israel however he said his group 
would have preferred that dutyfree trade benefits be denied to 
israel until conditions were cleared up in their entirety 
the generalized system of preferences program was begun in 1976 
to promote the economic growth of developing countries and help 
them compete with industrialized countries in the us market it 
provides preferential dutyfree entry to about 4100 products from 
136 countries and territories 
in 1984 the program was amended to require that countries 
benefits under the program be suspended if they are not working to 
provide internationally recognized worker rights 
benefits for burma and the central african republic had been 
challenged by the aflcio because of restrictions on the right to 
organize independent unions and other alleged violations of rights 
the aflcio also had filed complaints alleging violations of worker 
rights in haiti syria and malaysia 
a complaint against liberia had been filed by the lawyers 
committee on human rights which alleged that the liberian 
government restricts workers rights to organize unions and bargain 
collectively 
venezuelas trade benefits had been challenged by occidental 
petroleum based on its claim that the companys assets were 
expropriated without compensation by venezuelas governmentowned 
oil company in 1975 
the ustr said haiti liberia syria and venezuela will continue 
to be part of the dutyfree trade program while the complaints 
remain under review for up to a year 
aflcio spokeswoman lorrie mchugh said the organization was 
extremely disappointed with the governments failure to act on 
its petitions against haiti syria and malaysia 
we feel that the other three countries should have been 
removed because workers are being seriously exploited and denied 
very basic rights she said 
the changes announced thursday take effect july 1

queen elizabeth ii should be invited to a proper 
christian burial of the remains of the last russian czar which 
were reported this week to have been found in the soviet union 
burkes peerage said thursday 
not only the imperial familys relatives but others who wish 
to show their sorrow for the fate of the last of the romanovs 
should be able to attend said harold brooksbaker publishing 
director of the bluebloods guide 
he said the queen should not accept president mikail s 
gorbachevs invitation to visit the soviet union until she is given 
details of the fate of czar nicholas ii and his family gorbachev 
extended the invitation last friday over lunch with the queen at 
windsor castle at the end of a twoday visit here 
the czar a cousin of the queens grandfather king george v 
was shot with members of his family at ekaterinburg by bolshevik 
revolutionaries in 1918 
the soviet weekly moscow news reported wednesday that a former 
police officerturnedscreenwriter geli ryabov claimed to have 
found the remains 10 years ago in a field near the execution site 
but kept silent because times had not been right for publication 
ekaterinburg about 900 miles east of moscow was renamed 
sverdlovsk after the revolution 
brooksbaker said the question still to be answered was who 
killed them 
it was either on orders right from the top or from a local 
official in charge of the family who panicked when antired forces 
probably the czech legion then in the area approached the 
town brooksbaker said

the senate foreign relations committee voted 
143 on thursday to reject an attempt to brand the government of 
mexico as uncooperative in the us war against narcotics after 
secretary of state james a baker iii declared such an accusation 
is undeserved 
the attempt was made by sen jesse helms rnc who contended 
that president bushs certification of mexico as cooperative in 
narcoticscontrol efforts was unjustified 
the committee acted after chairman claiborne pell dri read 
a letter in which baker said mexican president carlos salinas has 
repeatedly pledged to make the fight against narcotics traficking a 
national priority 
baker added he has backed up his tough rhetoric against drugs 
and corruption with concrete actions i remain thoroughly convinced 
that the best way to reduce the flow of drugs through and from 
mexico is by improving our bilateral antinarcotics cooperation 
had the helms inititive prevailed the united states would have 
had to end any economic assistance to mexico and vote against that 
country in international financial institutions 
bush could have prevented that course of action by declaring 
that certification of mexico was in us national security 
interests even though congress had found it was not cooperating in 
antinartcotics efforts 
only sens larry pressler rsd and connie mack rfla 
joined helms in voting for the proposal

a city councilman conceded thursday 
that he may have misspoken when he told vietnamese immigrants if 
you want to be south vietnamese go back to south vietnam 
councilman frank fry stopped short of apologizing for the 
remark which he said was intended to suggest that immigrants need 
to make more of an effort to assimilate into american society 
some vietnamese immigrants in this suburban orange county 
community said they would try to recall fry over the remark 
delivered tuesday night before the council voted down a request for 
a parade to honor vietnam war dead 
were trying to promote harmony in the city said tien 
nguyen a member of the organizing committee for south vietnamese 
armed forces day we are observing the american way as well as 
our heritage 
parade committee spokesman arthur suchesk called frys comments 
nothing more than a bigoted racial slur against the vietnamese 
its like telling the irish to go back to ireland if they want 
to celebrate st patricks day or mexicans that they cant 
celebrate cinco de mayo he ought to be impeached 
fry was among four of five councilmembers who voted against 
closing a street in the citys little saigon area for a june 18 
parade to honor south vietnamese and americans killed in the 
vietnam war 
three of the four councilmembers who voted down the twohour 
parade said the parade organizing committee should time its event 
to conform with a us holiday such as memorial day 
its my opinion that youre all americans and youd better be 
americans if you want to be south vietnamese go back to south 
vietnam fry told the parade organizers that may be unfair 
but thats my opinion and im sure that is the opinion of a lot of 
people around here 
fry a world war ii veteran said thursday he had received about 
five calls from vietnamese immigrants supporting his statement 
because they believe the immigrants should assimilate but he said 
it may have been a little harsh to tell the immigrants to go 
back to their homeland 
fry said he meant only to counsel the immigrants to try to 
change and become an american learn english it is your new 
language join in with the populace and learn your new ways 
i dont mind being recalled he added but the 
polarization that would cause would be horrendous

covered with sweat sometimes 
collapsing from the heat and the odor sergio martinez dug alone 
for more than an hour as the body of a man about 30 years old 
emerged from the fourbytwo foot hole 
the man had a gold front tooth and had been gagged and 
blindfolded there was a rectangular cut over the left side of his 
chest which had been pulled up and out as if his heart had been 
ripped out 
police said one of the other 12 victims recovered from this 
ranch 13 miles west of matamoros had had his heart ripped out while 
he was still alive a sacrificial rite once used by aztec priests 
martinez 22 is one of five suspects arrested in what has been 
called a cult of human sacrifice police on both sides of the 
border are seeking the reputed leader or priest of the gang alonso 
de jesus constanzo a cuban national who had contacts in miami 
police officer rodrigo monforte said martinez had volunteered 
information on the 13th body and took police to the ranch just off 
the border highway along the rio grande 
police said they believe there is still another victim buried 
near the wooden shack that served the gang for the ritual murders 
martinez who insisted he was only a farm hand and had nothing 
to do with the murders wore blue jeans and a dark blue shirt 
police unlocked his right handcuff and gave him a pick and 
shovel he dug next to a pile of bales of cattlefeed 
he turned to police and asked to be allowed to rest and then 
asked for a tractor to dig the hole come on use your hands 
policemen yelled at him 
he was given brief periods of rest during which he told newsmen 
that he had only buried the body the padrino or elio killed 
him he said 
as he dug a man who came in wearing a large crucifix on his 
chest read psalms from a bible a few feet away from martinez 
i am a christian said the man who identified himself as 
santos yzaguirre i came here to pray for the souls of all the 
people buried here 
when the body was found martinez turned to police and asked for 
a face mask keep working he was told you didnt need one 
when you buried him 
however he was given a mask minutes later when he said he could 
not work because of the stench 
another time soaking in sweat he turned to an agent and asked 
are you going to give me a chance to bathe before i go back to 
jail 
yes he was told just finish the job you started 
one time he collapsed to the ground and asked for water a 
federal agent turned to the journalists and asked does any of 
you have any water with you 
nobody did but two onlookers with the police started helping 
martinez 
the body was naked and wrapped in a bedsheet 
all i did was bury him martinez insisted the padrino 
godfather did the killings i was just a ranch hand i did not 
see the killings 
these people were totally dominated by the cuban said a 
watching federal agent who declined to give his name they 
believed what he did actually protected them agains police on the 
mexican side they killed the american to seek protection from the 
us police 
this man believes he is without guilt he thinks burying a 
murdered man is like burying a rabbit the agent added

with a little help from his friends 
a teenager who wants to save whales has taken on big business 
organized a rally and helped dispel the notion that youthful 
activism is dead 
eric kessler a senior at highland park high school said 
thursday he launched his crusade after seeing an environmental 
groups petition urging marriott corp to stop buying icelandic 
fish in a move to halt commercial whale kills 
amazing things are going on at our school and all over 
chicago this started with five or 10 of my friends and its grown 
to astronomical proportions kessler 17 said in a telephone 
interview 
marriott a diversified hospitality company had a contract to 
supply icelandic fish to the cafeteria at the school in this 
northern suburb until eric got involved 
eric expressed his concern to school foodservice workers and 
telephoned marriott headquarters in suburban washington icelandic 
fish was taken off the menu last month as a result of his efforts 
bolstered by success eric and a handful of friends began 
planning a rally to support their position that iceland is 
violating a 1986 international whaling commission moratorium on the 
killing of whales for commercial purposes 
iceland maintains whales are being killed only for research 
with advice and help from environmental groups like greenpeace 
which has organized an international boycott of companies that buy 
icelandic fish kessler began distributing leaflets and making 
phone calls advertising the rally 
he said celebrities such as scientist carl sagan musician paul 
winter sen paul simon dill and highland parks mayor have 
promised to write letters of support for the april 21 rally 
students urged students at other high schools to come to the 
rally in front of the school and kessler estimates more than 1000 
people will show up to hear speeches by him a greenpeace official 
and others 
things have just been flying i get calls every night from 
people who say i can do this for you or have you tried to take 
this route kessler said 
school authorities are barred from officially endorsing the 
rally but several said they support erics activism and plan to 
attend 
i think eric raised appropriate sensitivity to the issue to 
the foodservices division said principal ronald tesch adding 
im certain it had an influence on the decision to stop buying 
icelandic fish 
we encourage our kids to think and to act on their 
convictions said counselor vernon hein eric isnt making it a 
school issue hes making it a kind of community concern 
hes really a gogetter people like eric are making it 
happen said sally shoup a whale campaigner at greenpeaces 
washington office 
marriott contends its a politica not an environmental issue 
to our knowledge iceland fish processors have nothing to do 
with the establishment of that countrys whaleresearch program 
said marriott spokeswoman leslie schlaggs 
we feel that any kind of economic boycott would be harming or 
targeting the wrong people she said and marriott explained that 
position to eric 
but hes hooked on activism 
its taking over my life and its a great feeling said 
eric who plans to study environmental conservation at the 
university of colorado next fall 
said 15yearold colleague becky auster a highland park 
sophomore it definitely gives me hope because a lot of people 
tend to think that todays younger generation is really apathetic 
and doesnt care whats happening 
this shows they do care they just need someone to help them 
get started

he was a small man known as trash can 
joe a vagrant who lived mostly at a mission but he could turn 
violent and when he was thrown out of an apartment house he 
returned to set it on fire killing seven children and two young 
mothers authorities say 
joe pickens 34 held thursday on a 2 million bond is charged 
with firstdegree murder and arson in tuesdays fire authorities 
said the victims died in their sleep as the second floor of their 
ramshackle frame house filled with smoke and flames 
joe was a small guy he couldnt whip a flea said jim 
garner who lives across the street from the burnedout house he 
didnt even have the mind of a teenager i just dont know what to 
think 
richard brienen superintendent at the peoria rescue mission 
pickens most frequent address said pickens could be mean and 
vengeful when drunk and once threw bricks at the mission after 
being ejected for breaking its rules 
my nickname for him was trouble brienen told reporters 
the guys used to call him trash can joe sometimes when hed get 
kicked out of here he would just go crawl out in the trash cans to 
sleep 
pickens had numerous runins with the law police said on march 
31 he ignored a judges order to begin serving a 30day sentence 
for resisting arrest the peoria journal star reported it was his 
22nd misdemeanor conviction since 1983 
the missed jail date was included on the jails list of 
violations to be brought to the attention of peoria county states 
attorney kevin lyons an action the jail says takes about two 
weeks 
i dont fault the sheriff or the jail lyons said the 
impression that the fire could have been avoided is not unusual 
in any tragedy 
its like if one of the victims had been just visiting and 
the mother says if only i had kept them home 
neighbors were not sure when pickens a native of york ala 
first appeared in peoria or why 
garner said pickens whom he has known about two years could 
not read or write and had the mind of a 10yearold 
fire chief g john parker said pickens apparently stayed in the 
apartment house he set afire but was ordered out monday night 
though parker did not know why 
on wednesday pickens admitted to police that he had set the 
fire in a rollaway bed in a vacant firstfloor apartment early 
tuesday morning 
he was an easygoing guy until he got into the booze garner 
said i guess he wanted to scare them because they put him out 
but thats a terrible way to scare somebody 
garners wife claudie said pickens was a friend of joyce barnes 
one of two residents of the house to survive the blaze 
shed ask him to leave sometimes but hed usually come back 
said mrs garner im angry and hurt and surprised hed do 
something like that to those folks they were nice and never did 
anything to hurt anyone 
killed in the fire were terry davis 27 and her three children 
karlissa 2 arnisha 7 and tanoa 10 davis sister wanda hobbs 
20 and her children ashley 1 felicia 4 and eugene roberts

the reallife participants in the rescue 
of toddler jessica mcclure from a well got a taste of tinseltown on 
thursday appearing as extras in location filming for a television 
movie about the rescue 
however most found that show business isnt all glamour and 
lights 
i think ill stick to police business said police chief 
richard czech who along with crew members and other extras spent 
almost five hours standing in a chilling drizzle at midland 
international airport 
most of the movie titled everybodys baby the rescue of 
jessica mcclure has been shot in suburban los angeles but the 
crew is spending two days in midland filming scenes of oil rigs 
drilling rigs and the citys streets and skyline 
the use of local extras and local details such as the actual 
jet belonging to midland oilman clayton williams jr which brought 
an underground expert to the rescue scene adds to the truetolife 
feeling the movie is trying to depict said producer john kander ii 
the film will show the story of 18monthold jessicas october 
1987 rescue from an abandoned water well after being trapped 
underground for 58 hours 
czech who is portrayed in the movie by actor beau bridges 
participated in thursdays shoot playing an unidentified man who 
greets the underground expert 
theyre trying to portray this as closely as possible doing 
all the little details the way they should be said czech who 
also consulted with the moviemakers when the script was put 
together 
police officer andy glasscock doubled as himself in one of the 
location scenes because actor walter olkewicz who portrays his 
character and all but two of the other cast members didnt come to 
midland 
glasscock czech and others learned that making a movie involves 
lots of waiting and standing around while huge props such as 
airplanes are positioned a brief shot of the landing of a federal 
express cargo plane took more than an hour to shoot and required 
two takes 
the normally sunny dry west texas weather turned cold and wet 
and a real federal express crew to be used in one scene disappeared 
when director mel damski was ready to begin shooting 
kandar lamented the puddles dotting the airport tarmac 
maybe we can work in that in midland they wet down the tarmac 
every day he joked but we have no time to put filming off 
the movie produced by interscope communications and scheduled 
to air sunday may 21 on abc will be delivered to the network 
just two or three days ahead of time kander said 
robert odonnell the paramedic who retrieved jessica from the 
well also took part in the production portraying a television 
reporter who walks off an airplane with the rest of the press corps 
odonnell played by actor sam whipple in the movie said the 
television recreation of the rescue will show things that werent 
captured on the nationally televised coverage of the event 
it will bring out the humanity of it the places when i 
cried he said it was emotional and thats what i want people 
to see

in lima police on thursday reported 305 people were arrested 
this week in el agustino slum in antiinsurgency sweeps officials 
said most of those arrested had no identification papers and were 
held briefly until they could prove their identities 
the violence fueled opposition charges that president alan 
garcias centerleft government is losing ground to the rebels and 
its antiinsurgency policy is in disarray

two graduate students said thursday they had 
detected indications of cold fusion in an experiment conducted with 
heavy water but they could not get the same results using ordinary 
water 
van l eden and wei liu physics students at the university of 
washington said they did not duplicate exactly the highly 
publicized experiment by university of utah chemist b stanley pons 
and martin fleischmann of englands university of southampton 
pons and fleischmann said they apparently produced nuclear 
fusion in a tabletop experiment using ordinary lab equipment 
but eden 28 and liu 27 said they did get indications that 
fusion may have taken place in their experiment last week 
in the experiment a mass spectrometer detected a possible 
indicator of tritium a radioactive isotope of hydrogen commonly 
produced in fusion reactions 
the indicator was found when the experiment was run using 
deuterium a hydrogen isotope and component of deuterium oxide or 
heavy water eden said the indicator was not detected when the 
test was repeated with ordinary water 
the students results if confirmed could help answer a 
question raised about the utah experiment by harold furth director 
of plasma physics at princeton university 
furth at a meeting wednesday of the american chemical society 
in dallas said that some experts believe the energy detected in 
the utah experiment is actually a chemical reaction that is not 
understood 
but he said if the experiment worked using deuterium oxide but 
not ordinary water it would suggest the reaction actually did 
involve some sort of deuterium fusion 
the students said however that they did not detect the 
substantial quantities of neutrons expected from a fusion reaction 
although they were not using a particularly sensitive detector for 
them 
for their experiment the pair used a test tube containing 
deuterium oxide in which a palladium electrode and gold wire were 
placed and connected to a power source the palladium electrode was 
connected to a vacuum chamber which in turn was connected to the 
mass spectrometer which detects nuclear particles 
pons and fleischman used a platinum wire instead of gold and 
observed the amount of excess heat produced rather than observing 
tritium particles 
eden and liu cautioned that their results were preliminary and 
needed review by other scientists they also said they had not 
ruled out other explanations for what was observed 
researchers at brigham young university texas aampm georgia tech 
and moscow university in the soviet union also have found possible 
indications of cold fusion but said their findings need further 
testing 
fusion the energy process that powers the sun and the hydrogen 
bomb has been touted as the ultimate energy source if a means 
could be found to produce it economically 
the two students said their major outofpocket expense was for 
about three pizzas bought by liu

with his position as the nations highest 
elected democrat in jeopardy house speaker jim wright mounted an 
emotional defense thursday against serious ethics charges and 
declared he would fight to the last ounce of conviction and 
energy that i possess 
in a carefully scripted 30minute counteroffensive delivered to 
reporters and television cameras wright sought to rebut point by 
point the charges being lodged against him by the house ethics 
committee which was writing its final report after a 10month 
15 million investigation of his finances 
wrights supporters called the appearance persuasive but other 
democrats were agonizing over the prospect that their most visible 
official might become a political liability and have to be deposed 
and a member of the ethics panel rep john t myers rind 
said the speech would have no effect on the committees 
conclusions we have a task to do and i dont think well be 
influenced at this point he said 
the committee completed work on its report late thursday and 
scheduled a news conference monday morning to release it the 
report will include a statement alleging that wright violated house 
rules in several dozen instances said a source familiar with the 
investigation 
flanked by members of his leadership team and texas colleagues 
wrights voice choked with emotion as he defended his wife betty 
against the charge that her 18000ayear salary from a fort worth 
business partner amounts to an improper gift 
he said his wife was a good decent caring thoroughly 
honorable person and he would damn well fight to protect her 
honor and integrity from any challenge from any source whatever the 
cost 
whether im speaker of the house which is the greatest honor 
ive ever had is not important wright said what is important 
is that congress move swiftly and im prepared to move very 
swiftly to get distractive matters of this kind behind us so that 
we can concentrate on the really important things that affect this 
country of ours 
he said his reputation is the most important thing and the 
only really important thing for my good name which is the legacy 
i intend to leave my children and my grandchildren i will fight to 
the last ounce of conviction and energy that i possess 
wright declined to field questions after his statement after 
his impassioned public defense wright returned to the business of 
the house appearing in the chamber to push for a vote on a 497 
million contra aid package 
rep charles wilson who was among the three dozen or so of the 
260 house democrats to attend wrights speech said the event 
serves to brace everybody up for a good hard tough fight but 
he added we havent hit bottom yet 
sources familiar with the deliberations said all crucial votes 
already had been taken and had gone against wright on the two most 
serious charges that he violated house rules by accepting gifts 
from a business partner with an interest in legislation and that 
he evaded limits on collecting speaking fees through bulk sales of 
his book reflections of a public man 
one source said the 12member panel evenly divided between 
democrats and republicans had been unanimous in its decision that 
wrights acceptance of use of a car and condominium constituted 
unreported gifts and voted 102 to place mrs wrights salary in 
that category the vote also was 102 to hold that wright sought to 
evade outside income limits through bulk book sales 
but on the most potentially serious issue for wright whether 
mallick had an interest in legislation the committee split 8 to 4 
with democrats chet atkins of massacusetts and bernard dwyer of new 
jersey siding with the six republicans on the panel 
the committee decisions essentially closed the 15 million 
investigation and sent the case into a new more open and more 
political phase which could lead to a disciplinary hearing and a 
range of punishments 
the investigation not only jeopardizes wrights leadership post 
but some lawmakers feared the action also pointed toward a new and 
unrealistic standard for congressional conduct one member of the 
ethics committee predicted the decisions would add urgency to a 
revamping of house ethics rules now in its early stages 
wright began his day wednesday with a 10minute highly personal 
speech to his strongest supporters at a closeddoor leadership 
meeting and was given a standing ovation according to 
participants they said his eyes misted as he lamented that his 
wife had been drawn into the ethics case i thought his 
performance was touching said rep david obey dwis 
later the texas democrat told reporters there are some 
things worth fighting for and one of them is personal honor and 
reputation earned over 66 years of living and giving and thats 
far more precious to me than any public office 
alluding to charges that his wife had done little work for a 
salary she was paid by a fort worth business partner wright added 
my wifes reputation is very precious to me and im damn well 
darn well not going to let that be sacrificed 
the mood among democrats was somber the report is certain to 
force difficult political decisions on whether to uphold their 
partys most visible official in the face of certain republican 
efforts to capitalize on the alleged ethical shortcomings of the 
man who stands behind vice president dan quayle in line of 
succession to the white house no speaker has ever been chased from 
office by ethics violations 
rep dale kildee dmich said members wanted to be fair to 
both wright and the house of representatives i think theres a 
deep concern both as to the person of the speaker and the congress 
itself he said theres a lot of agony 
during three weeks of deliberations debate and votes sources 
said the committee decided 
that upwards of 100000 worth of benefits wright and his wife 
betty received from fort worth real estate developer george 
mallick amounted to unreported gifts the benefits included 
mrs wrights 18000ayear salary from 1980 through 1984 and free 
use of a condominium and a 1979 cadillac house rules require 
reporting of any gift over 100 
that because of his extensive investments in real estate and 
oil and gas enterprises mallick had a direct interest in 
legislation before congress that meant any gifts worth more than 
100 accepted by the wrights would violate house rules 
that on several occasions wright sold bulk quantities of his 
book to organizations to which he had made speeches in lieu of 
accepting honoraria speaking fees are limited by the rules while 
book royalties are not 
the next step in the ethics process is for the committee to 
issue a formal statement of the allegations against wright the 
speaker then would have 21 days to present rebuttals and 
counterarguments before the committee determines whether to call 
for a disciplinary hearing to decide whether sanctions are 
warranted sanctions can range from a simple reprimand to expulsion 
from the house

drexel burnham lambert inc and the securities 
and exchange commission settled a huge civil fraud case thursday 
that will put the junkbond giant under close federal scrutiny for 
three years 
drexel also agreed to sever its ties with financier michael 
milken who was indicted on racketeering charges last month 
and the company announced that john shad a former sec chief 
instrumental in starting an intense investigation more than two 
years ago that led to the fraud charges would become its chairman 
the drexelsec pact clears the way for drexels previously 
announced agreement to plead guilty to criminal fraud charges and 
pay 650 million in fines and restitution to settle another case 
with the justice department 
the nations fifthlargest securities firm has been the biggest 
target of a federal crackdown on securities fraud stemming from the 
ivan boesky insider trading scandal boesky a notorious speculator 
now in federal prison has been a leading source of evidence 
against drexel milken and others 
sec chairman david s ruder called the settlement the most 
farreaching relief ever obtained by the commission against a major 
regulated entity 
we think it achieves everything thats needed for the 
protection of the investing public sec enforcement director gary 
lynch said it will also give us the ability to bring other 
people to justice that might not be brought to justice if we had 
stayed at war for another three to five years 
drexel said in a summary of the agreement that it was paying the 
largest penalties ever in a securities case and making 
comprehensive and unprecedented structural changes 
todays agreement with the securities and exchange commission 
caps more than two difficult years for the firm and positions 
drexel burnham lambert to move forward and fully devote our 
energies to our clients needs drexel said in a statement 
as a financial institution we know that our employees 
clients and creditors must have total confidence in our 
integrity drexel chief executive frederick joseph said in the 
statement 
under the settlement drexel will disassociate itself from 
milken whose pioneering marketing of highyield securities 
commonly known as junk bonds vaulted drexel into the forefront of 
1980s financial powerhouses drexel also agreed to either fire 
milkens brother lowell a senior aide or put him on leave 
the company and its employees are barred from entering into any 
private business deals directly or indirectly with milken current 
partnerships with milken such as ownership of drexels beverly 
hills calif junk bond headquarters do not have to be dissolved 
drexel also will pay 15 million in civil penalties an amount 
already accounted for under the total 650 million in penalties it 
already had agreed to pay the government 
drexel reached the settlement without admitting or denying 
guilt admitting guilt would have made the firm more vulnerable to 
private lawsuits by investors who claim they were defrauded 
the sec said in a statement it also had reached a settlement 
with cary maultasch a former drexel employee who was named in the 
case and reportedly emerged as an important cooperating witness 
the 184page sec complaint filed in september detailed 21 
alleged fraud schemes between 1984 and late 1986 portraying drexel 
michael milken and others as systematic cheaters who engaged in 
stock manipulation and insider trading 
under terms of the settlement 
drexel will appoint a special reviewer to oversee its 
investmentcompanyrelated operations 
drexel agrees to be placed on administrative probation for 
three years meaning the sec will give the firms operations 
special scrutiny during that period 
the sec and an independent accounting firm to be picked by the 
sec will monitor drexels junk bond activities for three years 
drexel will move its equity and convertible securities trading 
functions from beverly hills calif to new york 
drexels junk bond operation will remain in beverly hills but 
will be overseen by a member of a special committee 
drexel will create a committee to oversee internal functions of 
drexel a majority of the members of the committee will be outside 
directors of the firm 
the sec will have a say in who becomes drexels chairman for a 
period of three years 
drexel will purchase michael milkens equity interest in the 
investment firm and if lowell milken is no longer employed by 
drexel it will purchase his equity interest as well 
drexel will add three independent directors to the firm who 
will oversee internal controls and audit accounting and compliance 
and serve as a disciplinary committee 
shad will count as one of the independent directors the other 
two will be roderick hills also a former sec chairman who is 
chairman of manchester group ltd and ralph saul a former 
president of the american stock exchange and former cigna corp 
chairman who is chairman of peers amp co 
negotiations between drexel and the sec began in january but 
snagged repeatedly on several issues concering the future of the 
milkens 
it appeared that the 98count racketeering and fraud indictment 
of the milkens on march 29 helped clear the way for the pact both 
milkens pleaded innocent last week

congress overwhelmingly approved on thursday a 
compromise 497 million package of nonmilitary aid for the 
nicaraguan contras giving president bush a chance to forge a 
bipartisan policy on central america 
the senate completed congressional action on the measure 
approving the aid package on an 899 roll call vote 
the house earlier endorsed the paln 309110 voting yes were 
152 democrats and 157 republicans voting no were 99 democrats and 
11 republicans 
the congressional action represents an effort to declare a truce 
in the bitter yearsold fight between the white house and congress 
over aid to the contras and bring pressure on nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government to keep its promises to allow free elections 
and democratic reform 
this bill tries to set in motion a united singlevoice 
policy said house speaker jim wright of texas moments before the 
chamber voted 
it ends military involvement and covert efforts to overthrow 
governments in our hemisphere wright said 
at the same time he added it says to nicaragua that we are 
very earnest about you fulfilling these commitments that you made 
to internal democratization 
in the senate supporters of the bipartisan agreement voted down 
a series of amendments aimed at altering or scuttling a plan they 
said has the potential to usher in an era of cooperation between 
the executive and legislative branches of government on central 
american policy 
if this accord is circumvented or exploited it would be an 
enormous blow to the chances for bipartisan cooperation in a broad 
range of areas said sen patrick leahy dvt democratic floor 
manager of the contraaid package 
sen mark hatfield rwash who has voted against all other 
proposals to aid the contras said he decided to vote for the 
compromise plan after concluding that simply abandoning them 
because they have become a political embarrassment would be as 
immoral as the policy we were pursuing 
but sen jesse helms rnc one of the senates strongest 
supporters of the contras called the bush administrations plan 
little more than beans and bandaids 
my administration sought the least common denominator 
helms said this is not a bipartisan accord it is an accord that 
suited the other side 
in the senate voting against the measure were sens brock 
adams dwash bill bradley dnj dan coats rind alan 
cranston dcalif charles grassley riowa tom harkin diowa 
jesse helms rnc arlen specter rpa and malcolm wallop 
rwyo not voting were sens albert gore jr dtenn and david 
durenberger rminn 
i think we made a step in the right direction said senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas after the senate vote now 
we can be an active player in that part of the world if it doesnt 
work we can come back and try it again 
the compromise plan reached after more than two months of 
negotiations would provide at least a temporary truce in the war 
that has been waged between the white house and capitol hill since 
thenpresident reagan moved in 1981 to arm the contras as a force 
to battle nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
indeed many of the suspicions and much of the distrust that 
characterized past debates over aid to the contras were still 
visible as both chambers opened debate thursday 
some members clung to hopes more arms could be sent to the 
contras others said all forms of aid logistical as well as 
military should be ended 
the compromise plan would give the contras food clothing and 
medical assistance to sustain them through next february but it 
would bar aid for weapons and ammunition to renew the guerrillas 
fight against the government 
supporters of the compromise said it would put the sandinista 
leadership under intense international pressure to keep their 
promises permit free and fair national elections next february 
and observe the other deadlines for democracy set by agreements 
among central american presidents over the last two years 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine urged 
republicans not to offer amendments which he said could upset the 
delicate balance represented by the compromise plan 
president bush telephoned me this morning urged me to move 
this legislation promptly and made clear his opposition to any 
amendments to the legislation mitchell said 
he asked that the presidents urgent desire for this 
legislation be taken into account by members of his own party 
as debate opened on the house floor republican leader bob 
michel of illinois supporting the agreement told his colleagues 
that what it lacks in perfection it makes up in real effective 
help for the cause of progress and democracy in nicaragua and 
central america 
i wish we could do better but as legislators its not given to 
us to act only when conditions are perfect michel said 
but rep thomas foglietta dpa said continued support of any 
kind for the contras would derail the diplomatic peace process 
keep the contras in place as a fighting force and and not integrate 
them into nicaraguan society 
this accord hinges on winks nods and handshakes he said 
id really like to say i trust this new administration the bush 
administration for reintegration of the contras but how can i 
when i read that thenvice president bush played a role in 
supplying covert aid to the contras 
rep henry hyde rill a longstanding contra supporter said 
he would go along with the compromise 
i support this bill on the theory that if you cant get 
dinner take a sandwich and keep hope alive hyde said 
its a crow sandwich replied rep barney frank dmass a 
consistent contra aid opponent 
my problem is that price of crow has gone up were paying too 
much here to allow the architects of a disastrous contra policy to 
save face 
although the aid funds are to be approved through february 
congress would be given an opportunity in november to review the 
situation and halt the aid if it sees fit

jan 15 for treatment of heart and respiratory ailments 
his condition hasnt really changed but were trying to free

the telemetry unit provides for monitoring heart patients but 
less acute care than the intensive care unit 
marcos and his wife imelda 59 are under indictment on federal 
racketeering charges accusing them of stealing more than 100 
million from their homeland and stashing it in the united states 
us prosecutors have conceded that marcos is too ill to stand 
trial and have temporarily severed him from the case but the 
government is proceeding with the case against mrs marcos 
the ousted leader has more than 250000 in unpaid bills at the 
hospital mrs marcos claims the us government should pay the 
bills and that she is financially unable to do so 
the marcoses came here in february 1986 after their ouster in a 
popular revolt that catapulted corazon aquino to power ending

the tedious task of scrubbing clean the 
coastline and corraling remaining exxon valdez oil blotches 
continued thursday as a light sheen splashed islands at the 
entrance to giant cook inlet 
itll probably splatter them but were not expecting too much 
damage said hal alabaster spokesman for the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration were having trouble estimating 
whats going on out there because the currents are so tricky 
the leading edge of the spill sighted west of gore point on the 
kenai peninsula continues to break up said coast guard spokesman 
roy compton gore point is about 25 miles from the entrance to the 
cook inlet which leads to fishing towns such as kodiak and homer 
and even to anchorage 
the oil has not been seen in cook inlet alabaster said 
in prince william sound crews of workers continued to clean 
islands where tides have begun to wash from light sheen off the 
beaches 
thats favorable compton said it gives them more of a 
chance to recover the oil 
the shoreline was covered in oil following the march 24 
grounding of the exxon tanker which sent 101 million gallons of 
oil into the sound more than 840000 gallons has been recovered 
about 8 percent of the spilled oil 
coast guard commandant paul yost arrived in valdez to take 
charge of the cleanup effort 
after flying over the area yost said he could see a marked 
improvement since he visited to assess the spill for president bush 
two weeks ago 
things are getting better and were going to do everything we 
can to expedite the cleanup said yost it is important not to 
forget that we have a longterm cleanup not days or weeks but 
probably for months 
yost said he has given exxon until saturday to come up with a 
plan for beach cleanup including the number of personnel and 
logistical support 
im not in a happy relationship with exxon yost said im 
here to oversee what theyre doing and i have some marching orders 
from the president of the united states 
the national transportation safety board announced it will hold 
four days of public hearings beginning may 16 in anchorage 
the boards investigation will center on determining the 
probable cause of the accident said board member lee dickinson 
while we will be examining initial emergency response efforts we 
will not be assessing the environmental issues raised by the 
accident 
spokeswoman drucella andersen said the agency expects to call 
about 20 witnesses to talk about the nations worst oil spill 
winds were generally out of the northeast thursday meaning they 
could help push oil away from land but the forecast called for a 
wind shift to the southeast increasing to 35 knots with a gale 
warning the coast guard said seas were forecast to increase to 9 
feet in the gulf of alaska by friday 
exxonpaid cleanup workers have filled hundreds of bags a day 
with thick crude oil and gravel on naked island about 100 workers 
in oilsplattered yellow slickers were on the shoreline mostly 
scraping the crud off rocks with their hands 
they call it rock waxing 
ive been working with another fellow and weve packed at 
least 100 gallons of the oil on this beach for scooping it out of 
the rocks thats pretty good it makes a difference out of 10 
million said dean carl a wood boat refinisher from valdez 
this is a priority affair were doing good enough that every 
day its harder to find oil to pick up that means something 
workers are on the boats in valdez at 6 am ride for three 
hours to the island and get back on the boat at about 4 pm after 
seven hours of work when converted cruise ships and sleeping 
barges dubbed floatels are in place the workday will be 12 
to 14 hours because travel time to the islands will be eliminated 
the state has identified 3000 pieces of shoreline it hopes to 
clean by the rainy season in late august only 44 are ready for 
cleanup said department of environmental conservation 
commissioner dennis kelso 
we have a fairly short opportunity to finish this before the 
weather changes kelso said 
at the kenai fjords national park light oil sheen has 
splattered some outer islands and tar balls have reached some 
shoreline but no significant damage is reported 
the tips of the peninsula have been slimed for the past couple 
of days but the worst that could have happened hasnt happened 
yet said jon erickson a park spokesman 
fishing towns along the coast have spent four tense days waiting 
for the oil to hit land officials said that until all oil has 
broken up and swept to sea changes in the weather could still 
throw crude ashore 
aerial surveys earlier showed significantly less oil on the 
water the result of earlier high wind and rough seas 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration announced 
thursday that exxon made a 15 million down payment for the cost of 
assessing the spills longterm impact on alaskas natural 
resources 
administrator william evans said the money would go toward costs 
incurred by his agency and for years of research into the effects 
of the oil on sealife and animals in the region 
noaas going to have a team here for a very long time evans 
said 
he said the focus of the research would be on what steps will be 
necessary to restore or replace the fisheries and other natural 
resoucres affected by the spill 
the announcement came one day after interior secretary manuel 
lujan complained in washington that exxon was dragging its feet in 
providing upfront money for the planning process 
holland americawestours inc the states largest cruise 
operator announced it was contributing 100000 to volunteer 
efforts to save wildlife and will spend 1 million in television 
commercials to reassure tourists that most of alaska was not 
affected by the spill 
thousands of sea birds and otters have died as result of the oil 
slick which coats fur and feathers with a poisonous goop that 
prevents the animals from staying warm and bouyant 
biologists have recovered 150 dead otters fiftyfour of 113 
others being treated at a rescue center have died so far 1242 
dead birds have been found along the coast 227 birds have been 
rescued for treatment 87 of those have died and nine have been 
released 
the herring fishery season set for this weekend in the kodiak 
area will go on as scheduled officials said but fish will be 
tested for contamination

president nicolae ceausescu announced 
wednesday that as of march 31 communist romania had repaid all its 
foreign debt the romanian state news agency agerpres reported 
in 1981 romanias foreign debt totaled about 11 billion but 
the bucharest government stopped almost all imports of western 
machinery and stepped up food exports for hard currency at the 
expense of serious food shortages at home 
by the end of 1988 romanias foreign debt had dropped to about 
2 billion 
there have been no indications however that authorities will 
raise living standards by importing badly needed consumer goods 
hard currency earnings are badly need to buy western machinery 
and equipment to modernize mostly outdated industrial 
installations most available resources probably will be used for 
that purpose 
ceasescu runs the most repressive nation in the soviet bloc and 
his efforts to rid it of foreign debt left romania financially 
strapped with food and power shortages further reducing a poor 
standard of living 
the presidents announcement came at the opening of a threeday 
session of the romanian communist partys policysetting central 
committee 
i wish to inform the plenary meeting the entire party and our 
entire people that at the end of march romania fully paid back its 
foreign debt agerpress quoted ceausescu as saying 
this is the outstanding result of our peoples work devoted to 
the countrys socioeconomic development it proves the might of 
the romanian socialist economy and opens wonderful prospects for 
implementation of the party program of building the multilaterally 
developed socialist society and romanias advance to communism 
agerpres said ceausescu on wednesday received a group of us 
business people representing over 50 companies that have trade 
relations with romania 
romania was deprived of most favored nation trading status on 
the us market last year because of its record on human rights 
if accorded the privilege romania would get the same terms as 
those granted now or in the future to any other nation 
ceasescu referred to the issue in his meeting with the 
americans saying there is only one problem awaiting an 
appropriate solution that is to apply the 1975 economic accord 
which also provides for the mutual granting of the most favored 
nation clause unconditionally on either side 
ceausescu said he would like to see twoway trade between the 
united states and romania reach the 2 billion mark annually 
agerpres reported he did not give the current figure

a 5year vatican review of seattles archbishop 
who has come under fire from conservative roman catholics has 
ended the popes us representative announced tuesday 
a special threemember oversight commission that looked at 
archbishop raymond hunthausens ministry is completed and its 
mandate terminated said archbishop pio laghi pope john paul 
iis delegate to the united states 
in a twoparagraph statement issued in washington dc laghi 
said hunthausen has indicated that he along with coadjutor 
archbishop thomas j murphy will continue to address the issues 
which have been of concern to the church 
hunthausen responded i am grateful for the announcement by 
archbishop laghi of the closure of the work of the apostolic 
commission 
both archbishop murphy and i acknowledge the trial the church 
here has faced over the past several years yet we are also able to 
view the whole experience as a time of grace a grace which with 
the lords help will enable us to offer our leadership to the 
church in western washington in the years ahead 
hunthausen 67 said after a trip to rome earlier this year that 
he had been assured the review of his work in the seattle roman 
catholic archdiocese had been completed and that the apostolic 
commission chaired by cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago would 
be dissolved 
the commission which also included cardinal john oconnor of 
new york and archbishop john quinn of san francisco was set up in 
january 1987 to review hunthausens ministry the vatican has kept 
close watch on hunthausen since november 1983 after some 
conservative catholics criticized the archbishop 
in a move that outraged many us catholics the vatican in 1985 
removed hunthausens authority in five areas including ministry to 
homosexuals some liturgical matters and the tribunal that decides 
marriage annulments 
hunthausen had been criticized for being lax in those areas and 
an auxiliary bishop donald wuerl was appointed to take over those 
duties 
when that situation proved unworkable hunthausens authority 
was restored in early 1987 wuerl was transferred and murphy a 
bishop in montana was named coadjutor the commission was also 
named to advise hunthausen 
the commission met with hunthausen five times most recently in 
october 
tuesdays announcement was praised by sister kathleen pruitt an 
outspoken supporter of hunthausen and the director of mission and 
outreach for the sisters of st joseph of peace 
she said hunthausen has not significantly changed his leadership 
since the vatican investigation 
im sure some things have changed not major things said 
margaret hoffman director of the sons of st peter coalition a 
conservative group critical of the archbishops leadership 
ms hoffman said liturgical abuses still occur in the 
archdiocese and cited hunthausen washing a womans feet last month 
in a holy week ritual she said church teachings forbid washing a 
womans feet in the manner reminiscent of jesus washing his 
disciples feet

physicists popped champagne corks after a 125 million atom 
smasher made its first z particle a milestone in the quest to 
understand whats in the mind of god by studying the birth of 
the universe and the makeup of matter 
im happy with relief and joy said burton richter 1976 
nobel laureate in physics and director of the stanford linear 
accelerator center 30 miles southeast of san francisco 
richter said scientists drank champagne wednesday after 
confirming one z particle was produced tuesday by the 3milelong 
stanford linear collider after an almost twoyear delay 
alan weinstein a physicist at california institute of 
technology said the collider should help physicists inch toward 
their ultimate goal of developing a theory of everything a 
simple theory that would explain all the particles and four 
fundamental forces of nature many scientists believe the four 
forces are simply different forms of a single force that existed at 
the beginning of time

an estimated 25 million people in north and south 
america already are infected with the aids virus and some parts of 
the hemisphere may be facing a massive epidemic doctors warned 
today 
the researchers said the aids epidemic in some latin and 
caribbean nations may become as bad as the outbreak in africa 
although the severity will vary from country to country 
their concern expressed in an editorial in todays new england 
journal of medicine is based in part on the apparent spread of the 
disease from homosexuals to heterosexuals this shift will put far 
more people at risk of the deadly disease 
the world health organization estimates that at least 5 million 
people worldwide are infected with the virus and 350000 have

the only obvious explanation for nbcs 
threepart miniseries around the world in 80 days is that its 
some kind of public works project for outofwork actors 
no other reason could exist for such a tedious remake of the 
1956 movie that was rather silly at the time and succeeded only 
because audiences of 33 years ago were easily impressed by 
spectacle or were at least amused by picking out the 40plus major 
stars who appeared in cameos 
in 1956 it was hard enough to relate to the jules verne story 
hinging on the 19thcentury preposterousness of phileas foggs 
assertion that he could traverse the globe in 80 days its even 
harder in the age of the supersonic jet 
this version airing sunday through tuesday outdoes the 
original only by being twice as long 
it seems nbc is still trying to repay poor pierce brosnan for 
holding him to his remington steele contract and preventing him 
from becoming the next james bond in the movies one more 
miniseries like this or last seasons james clavells noble 
house and brosnan wont have a career to worry about his 
stickfigure phileas fogg is fine for the setup of the movie when 
fogg is presented as a tedious bore but the role requires him to 
loosen up eventually brosnan never does 
costar eric idle one member of the cast who has a regular gig 
nbcs midseason replacement comedy nearly departed plays 
foggs valet jean passepartout idle does a flimsy imitation of 
peter sellers french accent from the pink panther it is more 
irritating than amusing 
peter ustinov who doesnt appear to be a refugee from any other 
nbc shows is barely discernible under bluster and makeup as 
detective fix a floundering nincompoop who is trying to arrest 
fogg for robbing a bank the scripts meager attempts to make him 
sympathetic fail 
julia nickson another survivor of nbcs noble house plays 
an indian princess who falls in love with phileas and is dragged 
along for the ride her other nbc connection is that her husband is 
david soul star of unsub 
the 1956 version starred david niven cantinflas and shirley 
maclaine it was an entertainment extravaganza when bigbudget 
spectacles were uncommon the impressive list of cameos included 
marlene dietrich ronald colman noel coward peter lorre hermione 
gingold george raft gilbert roland and frank sinatra among many 
others compare to this years list which includes henry gibson 
john hillerman jack klugman darren mcgavin pernell roberts 
james b sikking jill st john and robert wagner how low have we 
sunk robert morley interestingly enough appears in both versions 
this one was filmed in england macao hong kong thailand and 
yugoslavia in 12 weeks as inthe original the endless scenes of 
boats and trains soon become indistinguishable 
in part 1 someone robs the bank of england phileas hires 
passepartout then bets a colleague that he can go around the globe 
and return to that same spot within 80 days on the way to paris 
he and passepartout run into sarah bernhardt lee remick catch a 
ride on a hotair balloon crashland in the coliseum board a 
steamship for bombay meet sir francis commarty hillerman board 
a train to calcutta that runs out of track purchase an elephant 
and find the princess nickson about to be burned on her husbands 
funeral pyre 
in part 2 phileas and passepartout rescue the princess proceed 
to calcutta board a steamer for hong kong meet a burmese prince 
get captured by bandits help free the burmese prince thereby 
improving englandburma relations then lose passepartout on a boat 
to yokohama another couple st john and wagner are arrested in 
place of fogg and the princess who board another ship along with 
detective fix the ship is swamped at sea but fogg the princess 
and fix escape in a lifeboat they reach yokohama where they find 
passepartout performing in a circus 
in part 3 everyone in england is convinced that fogg has been 
lost at sea but he and the others board a ship for san francisco 
in the wild west they encounter jesse james stephen nichols 
escape indian attack and finally reach new york but miss the boat 
to liverpool and hijack another when fogg reaches england fix 
arrests him and foggs chance at winning his bet seems to be lost 
of course it isnt but anyone who has stuck through this thing 
this far will have lost six hours that could have been much better 
spent doing something else

president bushs proposal to lower capital gains 
taxes may be in for some rough times in congress because opponents 
view it as a sop to the rich rather than a means of raising tax 
revenue 
the conclusions of politicians often vary widely from those of 
economists so the conflict isnt unusual political decisions 
often make bad economics and bad economics often have strong 
political backing 
what is unusual is that some of those who see only benefits to 
the rich in a lower capital gains tax are the same ones who see a 
threat to poorer folks in another proposal limiting the 
deductibility of interest on home mortgages 
as that law reads a homeowner is entitled to deduct interest on 
mortgages totaling 1 million a level which obviously excludes 
lower and middleincome homeowners only the wealthy could attempt 
or afford to borrow that much money 
in contrast hardworking middleincome families who have 
invested or saved small sums for long periods of time denying 
themselves in order to meet longterm goals could benefit 
enormously from a capital gains tax cut 
nevertheless respected members of congress such as rep dan 
rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means committee 
defend the 1 million ceiling as a threat to the poor while 
opposing a tax cut as a gift to the rich 
the most popular rationales for the apparent inconsistencies 
include these 
if you lower the 1 million ceiling on homemortgage 
deductibility you open the door to more cuts said a real estate 
spokesman all it takes is a pen for congress to scratch out 
one zero and 1 million goes to 100000 
therefore it is argued a stand must be taken at 1 million 
otherwise the poorer households are indeed endangered if not 
immediately then in the future congress it is said might even be 
tempted to erase the deduction 
for this reason say realtors rostenkowski has assured them 
that as long as he remains chairman of ways and means the ceiling 
will remain where it is 
while recent history shows that reductions in capital gains 
taxes can lead to much higher revenues because people feel freer 
to cash in longterm investments such as homes or stocks at lower 
rates some studies suggest only minimal revenue gains 
such are the ingredients of political disagreements 
somehow lost in the oratory however is the very basis for the 
arguments the rich versus the poor the contention that the poor 
must be saved even if the rich are denied a noble stance perhaps 
but is it straightforward 
assume an investment of 5000 in stocks held for seven years 
if the appreciation averages 10 percent a year you will have 
approximately doubled your money your capital gains would be 
5000 your tax 1400 
but while you appeared to have earned 10 percent your real 
gain was only 6 percent a year because of inflation at 6 percent 
your money wont double in seven years it will grow to only 7000 
or so your taxes remain at 1400 
after taxes your investment therefore is only about 5600 
an average gain of 100 a year for having denied yourself the use 
of the money and in fact put it at risk 
because your capital gains are taxed as ordinary income what if 
your investment lost money thereby lowering your income would you 
be able to claim a lower tax base no gains count losses dont

a fire drill emptied the interstate commerce 
commission building a few weeks ago sending hundreds of 
bureaucrats onto constitution avenue what caught a passerbys eye 
was that they kept asking the guards when they could get back to 
their desks 
when the allclear sounded they stormed the place 
government lawyer kristina nygaard says she generally carries a 
briefcase home and spends a few hours after supper with papers 
spread out on the dining room table working on hydroelectric plant 
licenses for the federal energy regulatory commission 
in this company town theres a lot of voluntary unpaid 
overtime exceptions can be found of course but many of the 
political appointees and highlevel careerists the people who 
really run the government are a hardworking bunch 
often a package of crackers and a soft drink at the desk serves 
as lunch and the real work gets done at the tail end of the day 
that flies in the face of the stereotype of bureaucrats as 
surly officious paper shufflers just putting in their time in 
fact some research finds that most americans are actually 
satisfied with their facetoface contacts with government workers 
most government people like workers everywhere do a days 
work then leave at quitting time government personnel officials 
say they are about as productive as other workers 
but closer to the top among the 5000 or so senior executives 
of government are many who are on the job early and late 
helmut hellwig who is with the national institute of standards 
and technology says he leaves home at 630 am leaves work at 
730 pm and when he goes in on weekends to put in a few quiet 
hours he is rarely the only one to show up 
another government worker is harry a blackmun 80 associate 
justice of the supreme court 
hear him describe his work habits the job for me is really 
seven days a week you can say my average work week exceeds 60 
hours its a rare saturday that i miss coming to the court i 
try to avoid coming in on sundays but i will work at home 
on saturdays the president may be at camp david but hundreds 
of his minions are laboring away 
like many agencies the irs requires employees to sign in if 
they enter the building during weekends signin sheets show that 
on average 500 people put in some extra time at their desks on 
saturdays and about the same number on sundays in all 6300 
people work at irs headquarters 
last fall when 45 million copies of your federal income 
taxes were printed irs people involved in its preparation 
travelled to the printing plant in new jersey worked weekends and 
even through thanksgiving reports the agencys public affairs 
director ellen murphy 
its hard to generalize but i would certainly say government 
people are very hard workers says business executive alan 
campbell who ran the office of personnel management in the carter 
administration 
adds donald devine who held that job under president reagan 
at the top of government by and large people work harder than 
they do in the private sector he says the work culture 
varies from one agency to another with the hardest working people 
in his view found at the pentagon and other defenserelated 
agencies and at the irs fbi and customs service 
one reason the day is so long for government executives 
meetings the boss his deputies and his agency heads spend much of 
their time in meetings that leaves the end of the day for reading 
the mail returning phone calls thinking about tomorrow and if 
theres time about the big picture 
mark a abramson who runs the center for excellence in 
government which is sort of an alumni association of 400 
exgovernment executives is a student of the subject 
in government he says there are more people you have to 
get agreement from you cant do anything unilaterally there are 
so many actors and so many bases to get touched the first time you 
forget to call an interest group and tell them what youre planning 
to do you get creamed 
once a policy emerges from all those meetings it has to be sold 
within the agency to the chief to other agencies that will be 
affected to the budget people to congress and to the interested 
publics more meetings 
moreover the person going to all those meetings must still 
manage his own little bureaucracy he has to get the staffs input 
before a meeting then brief the staff afterward so all march in 
the same direction 
political people often talk about their input i work 16 
hours a day i work 17 and weekends because there is no bottom 
line no profit or loss in government so they cant talk about 
their output says abramson 
on capitol hill congressional aides often young single and 
dedicated work long hours and then walk down the block to the hawk 
amp dove bullfeathers the tune inn or some such place to spend half 
the night socializing with the very same people they spent their 
day with and talking about what else work 
ask officialdom about work habits and joseph califanos name is 
likely to pop up when he ran the department of health education 
and welfare under president carter he was a legendary workaholic 
despite carters admonition to aides that he didnt want government 
to keep them from being good family men and women 
califano was famous for calling a staff meeting for 7 pm 
which might not get started until 8 or 9 and not end before 11 
he was a harddriving guy who wanted to do a lot and do it 
quickly and who expected people to be available when he wanted 
them recalls dan marcus califanos deputy general counsel 
califano installed lights on assistants phones to summon them 
right away now 
in those kinds of positions the responsibilities are heady 
the issues are interesting and you usually would come into those 
jobs with a fairly high level of enthusiasm and drive says 
marcus

george bush freely admits he has varied his 
position on abortion over the years leading up to his outright 
call for repeal of the landmark supreme court decision legalizing 
the procedure 
but even in the steadily evolving position that bush 
describes the president would still permit three exceptions to a 
ban allowing an abortion to save a mothers life and in cases of 
rape and incest 
as the supreme court prepares to hear arguments april 26 in a 
missouri case that could lead to the reversal or substantial 
weakening of the 1973 roe vs wade decision bushs position is 
clear he wants the decision reversed thinks the issue ought to be 
returned to the states and favors a prolife constitutional 
amendment 
his position wasnt always so clear 
in the 1980 presidential campaign bush said he would accept 
abortion to save the mothers life and in cases of rape and incest 
but when ronald reagan picked him as a running mate bush sought to 
minimize the differences they had on the issue reagan has 
steadfastly opposed abortion except to save the life of the mother 
please do not keep reminding me of the differences we had 
he told reporters at a news conference he and reagan had after 
accepting the nomination 
seven years later when he started campaigning for the 1988 
republican presidential nomination bush talked anew of the three 
instances in which he would accept abortion 
asked at a town meeting in iowa to state his position bush said 
succinctly oppose abortion oppose federal funding for abortion 
want to see roe vs wade changed so it wont legalize abortion 
during the general election campaign he seldom broached the 
volatile issue and when asked about it bush often would say 
tersely im for adoption not abortion 
but he got caught up in the issue again during a debate last 
september with democratic opponent michael dukakis at wake forest 
university 
asked by a panelist what penalties he would propose for those 
who continued to have abortions in a postroevswade scenario 
bush advocated criminal penalties for women who terminate a 
pregnancy 
thencampaign director james a baker iii now the secretary of 
state called reporters the next morning to tell them that bush had 
thought through the issue further 
what bush meant to say baker explained was that women who have 
abortions are additional victims and that any sanctions ought 
to be brought against those who perform abortions 
bush has acknowledged that his position on the issue has been 
evolving over the years he is known to have been deeply 
affected for instance when his son marvin and marvins wife 
margaret adopted a little girl i thank god that her parents 
chose life bush has said of his granddaughter 
three days after his inauguration bush told an antiabortion 
rally via a telephone hookup that abortion is our national 
tragedy and he spoke forcefully in favor of ending abortion on 
demand 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater was asked to explain how 
bush could reconcile his acceptance of three circumstances for 
abortion with his support for reversing the landmark supreme court 
decision 
asked what relief bush would suggest for a woman whose case fit 
one of the three categories but who lived in a state that outlawed 
all abortions in a postroevswade world fitzwater replied 
well he believes that roe vs wade should be reversed and that 
the states have responsibilities or rights to pass their own laws 
regarding this matter 
and he simply makes his views known on the issues and the 
states are free to follow that or not the press secretary said 
nancy broff legislative director of the national abortion 
rights action league said bushs position is tantamount to letting 
women fend for themselves 
what would he say to the women who are on medicaid who are 
brutalized by rape or incest who currently cant get funding to 
pay for abortions she asked i think what hes saying is that 
if he were the one making the rules hed allow abortions under 
three circumstances but what hes saying is that hed rather allow 
7416 state legislators to make this decision for women 
david osteen executive director of the national right to life 
committee said hes comfortable with bushs position even if 
bush has changed his statements over the years 
neither i as a person nor the right to life committee as an 
organization feels there has been any wavering in his position 
osteen said after all about 98 percent of abortions are not 
performed to save the life of the mother or for rape or incest 
osteen acknowledged however that his organizations ideal 
abortion premise is one that more closely matches former president 
reagans position permitting the procedure only to save the life 
of a mother 
diane wood a university of chicago law school professor said 
one of the complications of the missouri case before the supreme 
court is that overruling roe vs wade could rest on a 
constitutional theory that there is nothing in the constitution 
which expressly permits it so therefore it should be left to the 
states 
one position the president might want to take is to urge the 
states to enact legislation in a postroevswade situation 
recognizing the three exceptions that he would allow she said

when wouldbe reformers rose up in congress 
their elders used to say that you cant legislate morality so they 
didnt try 
that era is gone that slogan no longer is fashionable and the 
government has been trying for a generation to instill ethics by 
statute 
the results are mixed the issue is far more visible the 
rebukes and punishments for misconduct are far more frequent and 
the rules of conduct are far more stringent than in the days when 
the late sen everett m dirksen rose up in mellifluous protest 
against even the suggestion that members of congress should 
disclose their sources of income 
there are those of course who say that public ethics and 
values cannot be legislated president bush said as he sent 
congress his new ethics proposals last wednesday youre never 
going to legislate away impropriety or through legislation 
guarantee that everybody lives beyond the you know perception of 
criticism 
but he said there should be clear explicit and enforceable 
federal ethics laws applying across all branches of government to 
replace a code that now is in disarray 
one reason for that disarray is that congress has written ethics 
laws for other branches of government while exempting itself the 
american people do not understand why certain behavior is 
considered criminal when committed by an executive branch official 
or perfectly legal when committed by someone in another branch of 
government bush said 
one notable example is the revolving door that allows former 
members of congress to become instant lobbyists or contract 
consultants in contrast to executive branch officials who are 
barred from doing business with their former colleagues for at 
least a year after leaving government 
bush said the rules should be uniform 
but then he wasnt altogether consistent himself his proposed 
rule against a quick spin through the revolving door would seem 
applicable to the defense consulting work that was one of the 
issues raised against former sen john g tower bushs rejected 
nominee for secretary of defense 
when the president was asked how he squared his ethics proposals 
with his support for tower he said there was no conflict i see 
no contradiction whatsoever bush said 
the president did not propose legislation to ban speechmaking 
fees for members of the house and senate an omission that drew 
protests from the ethics lobby bush said hed leave that and the 
question of a congressional pay raise for later consultation with 
leaders of house and senate 
but the president did say flatly that honoraria for member of 
congress should be banned and that congress should have a pay 
raise a similar ban was proposed earlier this year but it was 
scrapped along with the 51 percent pay raise congress didnt dare 
to accept 
senate democratic leader george mitchell said he also favors a 
ban on honoraria with a corresponding increase in congressional 
pay he added that pay increases should not be effective 
immediately for the congress that approves them but after the next 
round of elections 
the open question is whether congress will risk taking on the 
politically unpopular question of its own pay again this year 
there is no point absolutely no point in putting congress 
through another traumatic bashing like the one just completed 
bush said 
another bush proposal underscored another inconsistency in 
ethics rules he said congress should act this year to close the 
loophole that permits some senior members to convert surplus 
political contributions to personal use that is permitted for 
members elected before 1980 
ironically that abuse was a central issue in one of the cases 
that marked the change in congressional attitudes about legislated 
ethics 
the year was 1967 when bobby baker was convicted of financial 
wrongdoing rep adam clayton powell was denied his house seat for 
misappropriating office and expense funds and sen thomas j dodd 
of connecticut was censured by the senate 
the central accusation against dodd was that he had used 
political funds for personal purposes that was held to have 
brought dishonor and disrepute to the senate 
now after a generation of ethics inquiries rulings and laws 
some similar conduct is held to be legal 
bush described his government ethics proposals to the american 
society of newspaper editors and he offered a pointed suggestion 
to a profession that is grappling with ethical questions of its own 
public service is not the sum of our perks or possessions but 
a measure of how we conduct ourselves and what we achieve the 
president said come to think of it this is a good code for all 
occupations from high school to the highest callings in journalism 
and government

fw woolworth cos board of directors has 
approved a new corporate structure that the giant retailer said was 
aimed at making itself more responsive to business opportunities 
under the plan which must be approved by stockholders 
woolworth would become a wholly owned subsidiary of a new holding 
entity called woolworth corp 
the company believes the new holding company arrangement would 
more accurately reflect the companys current management 
structure woolworth said wednesday in a statement 
additionally it would increase organizational operational 
and financial flexibility and allow woolworth corp to more 
effectively take advantage of future business opportunities the 
company stated 
the company did not elaborate on why the board took the action 
or what future business opportunities might be contemplated 
woolworth spokeman jf carroll said the company would confine its 
comments to the written announcement 
the plan to be presented to stockholders at an annual meeting 
in universal city calif on june 22 calls for outstanding shares 
of woolworths common and series a preferred stock to be 
automatically exchanged for equal holdings of the new woolworth 
corp which would be based in new york 
retail industry analysts said they were unable to determine the 
significance of woolworths move given that the new arrangement 
apparently would not alter the companys ownership in any 
meaningful way 
woolworths shares closed at 5150 in new york stock exchange 
consolidated trading up 150 
woolworth said that if the plan is approved each share in 
woolworth corp would represent the same interest in the same 
business and assets operated under the same management as did a 
share of the company immediately prior to the share exchange 
to bolster their abilities to defend themselves against unwanted 
takeover attempts numerous companies have realigned their 
corporate structures some adopting employee stock owernship plans 
esops to place a bigger portion of their shares in friendly hands 
last year woolworth attracted the interest of the corporate 
raiding haft family 
a partnership controlled by dart group corps chairman herbert 
haft last spring disclosed plans to acquire 15 million or more of 
the retailers stock 
haft and his son robert have become known as corporate raiders 
because on repeated occasions they have purchased stakes in 
companies made unsuccessful takeover bids and then profited by 
selling their stock when the companies have repurchased the shares 
or gone private in buyouts 
several analysts said they were unaware of any renewed takeover 
interest in woolworth lately nor have they heard speculation about 
what woolworth might be intending to do if anything 
woolworths which started as an owner of fiveanddime stores 
and has expanded into specialty areas such as sportswear had 
revenue of more than 8 billion in 1988 and operated more than 
7700 stores in the united states canada west germany and 
australia

whether texaco inc can keep its promises to 
become a more competitive more profitable company remains to be 
seen but the oil giant is definitely headed in the right 
direction industry analysts say 
since last april the nations thirdlargest oil company reduced 
its debt dramatically raised 7 billion in cash from asset sales 
and set a new business course that president james w kinnear hopes 
will make texaco one of the industrys most admired competitive 
and profitable companies 
at a meeting with industry analysts today texaco which is 
rivaled in size only by exxon corp and mobil corp is expected to 
present itself as a proudly reorganized more profitable company 
ready to meet the competition of the 1990s 
the story is an attractive one to see said michael young 
an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co 
analysts say management should take the credit for the companys 
turnaround 
theyve done a remarkably good job when you look at the events 
that have transpired said young 
frank p knuettel an analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc said last years skeptics have become this years believers 
after watching texaco exceed its initial asset sale plans 
now theyre thinking maybe this management does have this 
situation in grasp and i believe it does knuettel said 
but the company which has shifted its primary focus from 
refining oil to exploration and production still must make a big 
oil find and continue to prepare for crude price volatility 
the tests of its promises are still coming up said stephen 
smith of bear stearns amp co it wont be decided in a year 
in april 1987 texaco filed for protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws to avoid having to post a 
potentially ruinous multibilliondollar security bond in its fight 
with pennzoil co 
pennzoil had sued texaco claiming texacos 1984 acquisition of 
getty oil co interfered with pennzoils prior contract to buy part 
of reserverich getty in 1985 a houston jury awarded pennzoil a 
103 billion judgment texaco appealed the judgment but eventually 
settled with pennzoil for 3 billion amid heavy shareholder 
pressure to do so 
carl c icahn texacos largest shareholder began pressuring 
the company into boosting its stock value largely through the sale 
of assets after texacos board rejected his proposal to buy texaco 
for 60 a share last year icahn narrowly lost a proxy fight for 
control of texacos board 
even before the bankruptcy texaco had begun a major 
restructuring but icahns overtures led to texaco selling 7 
billion in assets including its lucrative canadian subsidiary 
texas canada inc rather than the 5 billion originally planned 
texaco also agreed to pay two special dividends consisting of 
cash and preferred stock with a total value of 8 per share or 
approximately 195 billion in addition the company plans to buy 
back 500 million in common stock before august 1990 
icahn who owns 17 percent of texaco agreed in return not to 
buy any more texaco stock for seven years 
many analysts say texacos stock price which has hovered in the 
53 range reflects its full value but that could change if icahn 
decides to sell his share 
last year texaco turned a profit of 13 billion or 535 a 
share compared with a 1987 loss of 414 billion but that could 
dramatically improve in 1989 
texaco still plans to sell about 300 million more in what it 
considers marginal properties 
last week it further reduced refining interests by announcing a 
joint venture with swedens ok petroleum ab that included the sale 
of its 43 percent interest in a swedish refinery along with its 
depots and marketing interests

atlanta attorney moreton rolleston jr a 
frequent passenger on embattled eastern airlines filed a petition 
with the us bankruptcy court that was used as the basis for the 
judges order in the case wednesday 
referring to rollestons petition us bankruptcy judge burton 
r lifland ordered the parties involved in easterns chapter 11 
reorganization to show why he should not throw the airline open to 
all biddersw and include ith it certain assets parent texas air 
corp has bought or transferred from eastern since acquiring it in 
1986 
among other things rollestons petition seeks to block the sale 
of easterns northeast shuttle for 365 million to developer donald 
trump 
rolleston 71 who handles litigation in cases involving real 
estate and other areas is a member of easterns frequent flier 
program who says he has flown 600000 miles on the airline since 
1955 
nobody so far has taken any interest in what the public needs 
except the judge lifland rolleston said late wednesday in a 
telephone interview from his home i think something ought to be 
done as soon as possible to get that airline flying 
lifland has said on several occasions that it is in the publics 
interest to return eastern to a full schedule of flights quickly

a manhattan diamond dealer says he has formed a 
partnership with an unidentified foreign airline that he said could 
raise more than 250 million by the end of the week for a bid for 
eastern airlines 
willy censor 62 said wednesday he had met with officials from 
eastern and us bankruptcy court to discuss his proposal for 
buying the strikebound carrier eastern attorney david boies 
confirmed he met with censor but declined to say whether the 
airline was taking the bid seriously 
a 464 million proposal from a group headed by former baseball 
commissioner peter v ueberroth collapsed wednesday over a reported 
union demand that an interim trustee run the airline during 
bankruptcy proceedings 
censor owns o censor and co founded by his father in antwerp 
belgium in 1917 and now located in manhattans diamond district 
he said he has owned stock in airlines 
i am interested in airlines in any business that can make 
money censor said in an interview in us bankruptcy court 
he declined to name the overseas airline with which he said he 
had formed a a partnership but said they have all the expertise 
i need 
he told me hes been dreaming about owning an airline since he 
came to america in 1946 said judah dick censors attorney 
all i can tell you is he has some connection with some 
overseas airline that has apparently taken an interest in buying 
out eastern dick said hes going to finance it because the 
airline doesnt have the wherewithal to finance it 
censor said he met with us trustee harold jones on friday to 
discuss the bid he said jones told him to submit a proposal to 
david shapiro the courtappointed examiner overseeing part of 
easterns bankruptcy proceedings jones and shapiro were 
unavailable for comment 
censor said he sent a telegram on friday to shapiro outlining 
his interest in the deal and unsuccessfully tried to contact 
ueberroth and frank lorenzo chairman of eastern parent texas air 
corp 
my group is now in a position to obtain within one week from 
today commitments from appropriate banks and from my own resources 
of in excess of 250 million for the purchase of control of eastern 
airlines the cable read 
moreover i can provide such further financing thereafter as 
would be required to assure the airlines viability without 
recourse to the eastern shuttle 
i am confident that retaining the eastern shuttle will assure 
more success with the machinists than mr ueberroth will have 
because as they well know the shuttle is at the heart of any 
profitability which eastern may have and is the key to its future 
viability 
eastern sought federal bankruptcy court protection from 
creditors on march 9 five days after its machinists union went on 
strike and was joined by its pilots and flight attendants

mexico will be firm but very cautious in 
debt talks next week with its commercial bank creditors now that it 
has in hand a 365 billion loan from the international monetary 
fund top mexican officials said wednesday 
us treasury secretary nicholas bradys third world debt 
reduction plan speeded negotiation of the loan the officials told 
reporters at a background briefing 
we got what we wanted said one of the officials speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
mexico also will ask banks to reschedule about 2 billion in 
amortization of principal that come due this year they said 
president carlos salinas de gortari wants to reduce the burden 
of mexicos 107 billion foreign debt and keep more money inside 
the country for economic investment mexico is the developing 
worlds secondlargest debtor behind brazil which owes 121 
billion 
mexicans have seen their standard of living decline by half over 
the last seven years and salinas is under political and social 
pressure to reverse that course and renew growth 
the threeyear agreement reached tuesday with the imf is the 
first since brady outlined a plan last month that he hoped would 
help ease payment terms on the third worlds 132 trillion foreign 
debt 
getting creditor governments banks the imf and the world bank 
to coordinate will take time one mexican official warned but 
brady brought together proposals by leaders of industrialized and 
developing nations and pushed the plan 
in this sense the brady plan has speeded up the process he 
said adding it took just 11 days of direct talks to hammer out the 
imf loan 
the 365 billion loan will be used to bolster mexicos foreign 
exchange reserves and spur economic development about onethird of 
loan proceeds will be used to support mexicos debtreduction 
proposals to the banks the official said 
together with other shortterm credits mexico is seeking from 
the imf the world bank and other sources mexico will devote about 
500 million annually to debt reduction he said 
treasury secretary pedro aspe said tuesday that mexico will 
offer banks the option of exchanging old debt for mexican bonds 
that discount debt principal and reduce interest rates 
mexico may choose to use loan proceeds to buy us treasury 
bonds as collateral that the mexican bonds will be paid one 
official said wednesday 
the banks need an inducement to buy the bonds and this costs 
money we have to go into debt to get out of debt he said 
issuing bonds to banks that retire part of their mexican debt is 
an attractive option to mexico with each dollars worth of bond 
capable of saving mexico up to 12 in loan service costs over a 
30year period the official said 
other options for bank creditors are being explored to meet 
mexicos goal of reducing its net outflow of resources to pay debt 
from 6 percent to 2 percent of annual gross national product the 
officials said 
we dont yet know how the restructuring talks will work out 
one said well put before the banks option a option b and 
option c and use what they take 
mexico also will ask banks whose mexico amortizations come due 
this year to reschedule payment the officials said they estimated 
the amount at 2 billion but did not say how much time they were 
seeking 
they added that implementing the brady plan with such ideas as 
creating a multinational pool of funds to support debt writeoffs 
still lack details but that creditor banks are well aware of 
mexicos urgency in reaching a restructuring agreement 
we have to be firm but very cautious one official said 
the urgency is obvious but we must not allow ourselves to fall 
into it the banks are aware of this urgency 
negotiations with a 13member bank committee are set to begin 
april 19 in new york

wesray capital corp a new york investment 
company founded by former us treasury secretary william simon 
has approached a northwest airlines union about a takeover bid for 
the airline according to a published report 
northwest union leader bruce retrum was quoted in thursdays st 
paul pioneer press dispatch saying that saunders miller a 
minneapolis financial consultant contacted him within the last 
week to try to set up a meeting with him leaders of other 
northwest unions and a wesray representative to discuss a leveraged 
buyout 
there were no specifics but my assumption was that he wanted 
to talk about an esop employee stock ownership plan or some 
employee stock ownership said retrum secretarytreasurer of 
teamsters local 2747 which represents some of the airlines 6500 
flight attendants 
the meeting was scheduled for thursday but then postponed by 
miller retrum said 
miller declined comment telling the newspaper there is 
nothing going on today that im aware of 
wesray has participated in a number of buyouts including the 
employee purchase of avis but last week a spokesman for simon said 
he wasnt interested in buying northwest 
meanwhile the failure of los angeles billionaire marvin davis 
to release details wednesday of a plan to finance his proposed 
262 billion takeover of northwest was viewed as a hopeful sign by 
gov rudy perpich who is fighting to keep the airline independent 
perpich said davis had been expected to release details of his 
plan wednesday 
nwa inc stock closed wednesday on the new york stock exchange 
at 9050 up 150 surpassing davis offer of 90 a share 
davis an oil mogul with interests in real estate and 
entertainment says he plans a shareholder proxy fight to win 
control of the airlines board at nwas may 15 shareholders meeting 
last friday nwas board of directors rejected davis offer 
calling it inadequate the board also reaffirmed its intention to 
maintain the nations fourthlargest airline as an independent 
entity 
northwest based in suburban eagan has asked a federal judge to 
prevent davis from negotiating with its unions while davis has 
filed a separate lawsuit seeking to invalidate northwests poison 
pill antitakeover plan 
shortly before davis announced his bid march 30 the airline 
disclosed that another investor whom it would not identify holds 
a 49 percent stake in nwa stock

hewlettpackard co surpassed its 
rivals in the thriving computer workstation market when it 
announced a surprise agreement to buy apollo computer inc 
analysts say 
hewlettpackards 476 million cash purchase offer for apollo a 
pioneer in the engineering workstation market also stole some 
limelight from principal rival sun microsystems inc which picked 
wednesday to unveil an entire overhaul of its highpowered 
workstations line 
were pretty sure they wont be too delighted to hear this 
said richard watts director of marketing in hewlettpackards 
computer products sector speculating on suns reaction to the 
acquisition 
the announcement wednesday moved hewlettpackard into the 
leadership position in the 4 billion computer workstation market 
apollo and hewlettpackard together would have 304 percent of the 
workstation market taking the lead from sun which has 283 
percent according to dataquest inc a san josebased research 
firm 
the workstation market is expected to grow at a 30 percent clip 
through 1993 according to alea fairchild an analyst with 
dataquest 
workstations are singleuser computers that resemble personal 
computers but are usually quicker more powerful and with larger 
screens and better graphics they were originally used mostly by 
scientists and engineers but are being increasingly targeted for 
everyday personal and business use 
it signals a real major commitment on our part to the 
workstation portion of our business said watts 
hewlettpackard based in palo alto said it will offer 1312 
per share for apollos estimated 36 million shares of common stock 
outstanding and will begin its tender offer within five business 
days 
apollo shares shot up 462 to close at 1275 in heavy 
overthecounter trading of 10 million shares hewlettpackard fell 
75 cents a share to 5350 in consolidated new york stock exchange 
trading 
the deal requires regulatory approval and the tender of at least 
51 percent of apollo stock by shareholders the deal should take 90 
days to complete said watts 
apollo a fortune 500 company founded in 1980 and based in 
chelmsford mass has suffered recent setbacks in the race with 
sun and lost money in two consecutive quarters last year it 
squeezed out a profit of 21 million for the year as a whole on 
sales of 654 million 
but apollo chairman and ceo thomas a vanderslice said wednesday 
that the companys earnings due out next week would show very 
strong results 
apollo will likely operate as a division within 
hewlettpackards workstation group once the acquisition is 
completed which should be in 90 days said watts 
vanderslice termed the transaction a winwin situation for 
both companies and said he did not foresee major layoffs resulting 
from the purchase 
hewlettpackard said it will benefit from apollos strength in 
computer networking and its large customer base and motivated work 
force 
hewlettpackard will bring its strength in the graphics area to 
apollo which could use the help as well as financial resources 
that include 98 billion in revenues last year 
the hewlettapollo thing was pretty astonishing said 
michael murphy a senior analyst and editor of san franciscobased 
california technology stock letter what hewlett i think is doing 
here is building a lot of customer relationships that they are then 
going to migrate over into the unix world 
workstations run on unix an operating system that excels in 
communications and the ability to carry out multiple tasks 
simultaneously 
the announcement came as sun microsystems rolled out a line of 
computers that boast sophisticated new graphics and digital sound 
plus higher speeds and a circuit board that allows fullmotion 
video on a computer screen useful for teleconferencing it also 
launched a family of sun3 workstations 
i think that maybe is purely coincidental but it is 
interesting timing said barry f bosak an analyst with new 
yorkbased smith barney harris upham amp co 
hewlettpackard had 169 percent of the 198788 market share for 
workstations and apollo had 135 percent dataquest said

millions of cars and trucks are recalled 
annually when they roll into dealerships dollars follow 
its profitable for the dealership to do the recalls said 
bill schmirl service manager at doan ford in rochester ny 
theres markup on parts and labor 
service managers eyes lit up earlier this week when ford motor 
co asked car and truck owners to return more than 340000 vehicles 
to fix a variety of safetyrelated and other problems 
the recalls involved suspension problems in trucks a seat belt 
bolt in new luxury cars potential electric troubles in some 1988 
model cars and trucks and cracked and discolored leather 
upholstery in a car ford imports from west germany 
the national highway traffic safety administration said about 
42 million vehicles were recalled in 1988 for safetyrelated 
problems the environmental protection agency said 33 million were 
recalled for emission system problems in addition automakers 
independently issued recalls for other reasons 
for dealers service departments each vehicle brought back for 
the free repairs means profits on parts and labor costs borne by 
the manufacturer 
it is a good time to sell service said bill heitritter 
service manager at crescent chevroletgeo in des moines iowa it 
helps the dealer because its a selling thing 
we process about 2000 to 3000 recalls a year he said 
its a priority thing for us 
automakers declined to say how much they spend on recalls 
annually regardless of the expense ford spokesman chuck snearly 
said paying for recall repairs is just good business 
its considerably less than the cost of a lawsuit and the 
disloyalty of an owner down the road he said people dont 
mind having a problem when its fixed for free what will get you 
into trouble is if you have a problem and you dont respond to 
people 
general motors corp spokesman dave hudgens added that 
research shows that customers want to hear from the manufacturer 
when there is a safety concern 
automakers learn of possible problems from various sources 
including assembly line workers drivers at proving grounds 
consumer groups and government agencies 
after investigating a manufacturer will decide whether to issue 
a recall on its own the federal highway safety organization and 
the epa can order recalls but most are made by automakers 
sometimes with government prodding 
notifying owners is a tough job in a country that lives on 
wheels automakers often consult rl polk amp co in detroit which 
monitors us vehicle registrations to find who owns a vehicle 
being recalled 
we continue to follow up and send letters wave after wave of 
letters until we get a completion rate as high as we could get 
fords snearly said 
that ranges from nearly 100 percent for a new car to 75 percent 
for a 5yearold vehicle older cars or those that have changed 
hands are harder to find 
problems appearing more serious to consumers such as possible 
steering failure typically get a higher initial response rate 
than problems that seem less critical such as an emissions system 
leak 
depending on the trouble customers may wait to have recall work 
performed until their vehicle is due for routine maintenance or 
until something else goes wrong sometimes recalls are simply 
ignored 
the automakers maintain they are clear of liability for defects 
once a good faith attempt is made to find the owner of a recalled 
car 
some dealers routinely check for pending recalls when cars 
arrive to be serviced 
ford said that occurred recently during the american pony 
drive a caravan of ford mustangs brought to the united states by 
their european owners in connection with the models 25th 
anniversary 
the driver of a 1969 mustang shelby gt went to a dealer to have 
some work done the dealer found that ford had recalled the car 20 
years ago to move part of the fuel system away from the exhaust 
system snearly said 
the driver had the car in europe and hadnt been aware of 
the recall he said the problem was promptly fixed

the federal communications commission says it 
will consider whether there is enough competition in the 
longdistance market to give the american telephone amp telegraph co 
more latitude in pricing 
a decision to unleash atampt if it came would be a major change 
in federal regulation of the telephone industry atampt has always 
been considered a dominant carrier that could crush its 
competition if not restrained and it has been tightly regulated 
but atampt has said that since 1984 when it agreed under federal 
order to shed local telephone companies it no longer is the 
dominant force in the longdistance business 
commissioner patricia diaz dennis asked wednesday for a broad 
look at longdistance competition after the commission ordered atampt 
to revise or stop offering its socalled tariff 12 custom service 
plan for some major customers 
dennis said she agreed with the fccs order on tariff 12 which 
gives atampt 30 days to revise its plan but that the commission had 
not addressed the larger issue of whether the longdistance 
marketplace was competitive today 
it is the seminal issue in so many of the other issues weve 
looked at she said in an interview 
fcc chairman dennis patrick agreed and asked his staff to find a 
way to determine exactly what kind of competition atampt faces and 
then regulate accordingly dennis said 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said that by agreeing to look at 
longdistance competition this commission recognizes that the 
world is changing and it needs to take a hard look at the realities 
that face all those in the longdistance business rather than 
shaping public policies on realities that were prevalent before 
1984 
in its tariff 12 order the commission said it found the plan 
was not widely available to other customers and therefore illegal 
but atampt will not have to stop serving its existing tariff 12 
customers which include the general electric co du pont co and 
ford motor co instead those customers can take service under the 
tariff until the deadline for revising or withdrawing the tariff 
the commission gave atampt 30 days to implement changes or drop 
the tariff 
tariff 12 integrates voice and data services into packages to 
meet specific customer needs critics of tariff 12 argue that atampt 
is simply bundling basic phone services that are strictly regulated 
by the fcc adding in a network management provision and then 
offering the package to large customers at reduced rates 
the effect would be to possibly undercut competitors prices 
but the commission found that atampts basic phone services were 
not like the integrated services offered under tariff 12 
therefore atampt the commission said was not offering price breaks 
to ge or dupont for example for the same services it provides 
nontariff 12 customers 
the commission also found that the tariff 12 packages were 
like each other so atampt was not favoring one tariff 12 
customer over another 
but it said some tariff 12 provisions were unlawful because they 
contained unreasonable geographic restrictions which deny service 
to similarly situated customers seeking like packages 
one of atampts main competitors mci communications corp said 
it found it inconceivable that the commission having found 
tariff 12 to be unlawful is allowing these rates to remain in 
effect while atampt develops new and probably similarly unlawful 
rates to replace them 
when atampt resubmits the tariff 12 plan for approval the fcc 
said the company must state that the plan will be generally 
available and that it eliminates any unreasonably specific 
limitations on availability 
atampt said it was pleased with the order 
todays fcc action is another step forward for atampt and 
particularly for customers who unanimously support allowing atampt to 
be able to compete to meet their needs we believe we will be 
able to conform to the fccs guidelines

the dollar fell in active european trading late 
this morning gold prices were little changed 
currency dealers attributed the drop to rumors of the 
appointment of a new west german finance minister who reportedly 
wants to reduce or even eliminate a controversial 10 percent 
withholding tax on interest income 
they said that while the dollar is losing ground against most 
major currencies active buying of deutsche marks is moving the 
market 
the dealers were referring to media speculation that west german 
chancellor helmut kohl will name theo waigel head of the 
conservative christian social union to replace finance minister 
gerhard stoltenberg 
they said waigel has made the repeal or modification of the 
withholding tax on interest income a condition for taking the post 
the tax instituted jan 1 has led to a large outflow of capital 
from west germany since and has weakened the marks exchange rate 
most people i talked to think the rumors of the tax repeal 
are nonsense but you cant exclude anything said one dealer at 
a large west german bank in frankfurt there is nothing going on 
so people jump on small things like that 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar slipped 005 yen to a closing 13280 later in 
london it was quoted at 13255 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late wednesdays 
prices included 18702 west german marks down from 188575 
16565 swiss francs down from 16645 63330 french francs down

italian lire down from 138100 and 11880 canadian dollars down 
from 118875 
in london one british pound cost 16994 slightly more 
expensive for buyers than late wednesdays 16925 
gold opened in london at a bid price of 38775 a troy ounce up 
from 38725 bid late wednesday at midmorning the citys five 
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of 38780 
in zurich the bid price was 38765 up from 38730 bid late

eastern airlines skeleton management staff can now 
put aside at least temporarily worries about a change in 
ownership and focus on rebuilding the faltering airline says a 
company spokesman 
officials announced wednesday that a proposed 464 million offer 
to buy the carrier from a group led by peter v ueberroth had 
fallen through 
its really been a roller coaster spokesman robin matell 
said wednesday its really been impossible to concentrate on a 
plan as such 
eastern president phil bakes in announcing the end of the 
buyout effort by former baseball commissioner ueberroth said the 
company envisions a gradual rebuilding to an efficient carrier with 
about 18000 employees and 130 to 150 jetliners flying to 60 to 80 
cities 
we are going to continue to bring in new recruits and continue 
to build our system bakes said in new york we are hopeful we 
will be afforded the opportunity to accelerate and work on that 
task 
matell said it was premature to discuss how eastern flying only 
10 percent of its schedule since its unions walked out march 4 
will get back to 50 to 60 percent of its old schedule of 1040 
flights daily 
eastern employed 40000 people when texas air corp chairman 
frank lorenzo bought the company in 1986 a number that dwindled to 
30000 before the strike 
union leaders however doubt that easterns management can 
overcome negative publicity some 25 billion in debt a recent 
history of steady losses and the need to find qualified workers to 
replace strikers 
the airlines is in a spin its almost hit the ground and 
theyre still telling people they can pull it out said eastern 
pilot ed potter who scoffed at bakes promise to rebuild the 
airline 
spokesman james ashlock said eastern has been quietly calling 
nonunion workers back to a work force now at 4500 from a low of 
1000 the first week of the strike the company had 12000 
nonunion employees when the strike began and officials said they 
dont know how many will be willing to return 
ashlock said employees who have stayed on the job had had a lot 
of concerns about the ueberroth deal which would have given the 
unions 30 percent ownership in exchange for pay and wage 
concessions 
it looks like we move on to another phase said ashlock i 
do think there is a certain release of anxiety here at the base 
where a great many people particularly the noncontract people 
were increasingly concerned at the way the situation had been 
building 
eastern now has 115 or 116 flights daily after resuming service 
on bahamas and atlanta routes this week ashlock said the company 
has concentrated on its most profitable routes mainly its 
northeastern shuttle service and latin american service in its 
strike schedule 
since the strike began eastern competitors particularly 
american airlines have expanded service to capitalize on easterns 
woes and the company acknowledges it must overcome consumer 
skepticism discounted tickets and other lures are likely the 
company has said 
but eastern needs more pilots only 200 of 3600 pilots have 
flown since their union joined the machinists strike 
the company still hopes to gain a federal appellate court order 
sending the pilots back to work even though us district judge 
edward b davis on wednesday reported to a appeals court that there 
was no evidence to support company claims the pilots are on an 
illegal strike 
ashlock said 34 newly recruited pilots are in the third week of 
a sixweek training course 34 more are in the second week and a 
third class will begin next week 
so far eastern hasnt needed to hire any new mechanics to 
replace striking machinists ashlock said

japans trade surplus fell in march to 674 
billion its first decline in seven months from yearearlier 
levels the finance ministry announced thursday 
japanese exports had exceeded imports by 746 billion in march 
1988 and by 724 billion in february 1989 
the march figure brought japans trade surplus for fiscal 1988 
which ended march 31 to 7901 billion up from 7599 billion the 
previous year and the first increase in two years 
exports in fiscal 1988 increased 147 percent to 27294 
billion while imports rose 197 percent to 19392 billion the 
ministry said 
ministry officials said strong overseas demand for japanese 
products throughout the fiscal year had boosted exports especially 
of semiconductors computers cars and business machines 
they said imports remained brisk because of strong japanese 
domestic demand and included increased flows of foreign 
manufactured goods 
the ministry officials said the fiscal 1988 surplus rose mainly 
because of lower prices for oil japans largest import commodity 
in march exports climbed 169 percent from a year earlier to 
2655 billion while imports surged 298 percent to 1981 
billion the ministry said 
after seasonal adjustments the march surplus came to 557 
billion a sharp drop from 886 billion in february the ministry 
said 
the officials said imports surged in march as companies began 
importing in earnest after several months of restrained consumption 
due to emperor hirohitos death on jan 7 and funeral on feb 24 
importers also stepped up transactions before the end of the 
japanese fiscal year they said 
the trade surplus with the united states in march ballooned to 
413 billion from 340 billion a year earlier the ministry said 
exports grew 216 percent to 875 billion while imports rose 22 
percent to 462 billion 
for the fiscal year the trade surplus with the united states 
declined slightly to 4910 billion from 5084 billion in fiscal 
1987 exports to the united states rose 84 percent to 9260 
billion while imports grew 257 percent to 4350 billion the 
ministry said 
japans trade surplus with the european economic community in 
march fell to 167 billion from 193 billion a year earlier it

chancellor helmut kohl today fired his 
defense minister and replaced seven other cabinet members in an 
apparent bid to stop his partys declining popularity 
in addition to the defense post kohl announced a new chief of 
staff and new ministers for finance interior transport economic 
cooperation construction and information 
he told a news conference the changes were not a direct 
consequence of his christian democratic unions recent election 
setbacks but he conceded his party and coalition government face 
a totally new situation 
the christian democratic union under kohl has suffered severe 
losses in recent local elections last month the party and its 
junior coalition partner the free democratic party lost control 
of the frankfurt city government 
i had planned this cabinet rebuilding long before that kohl 
said when asked about the frankfurt elections influence on his new 
appointments 
defense minister rupert scholz was the only cabinet member left 
jobless under the changes he was replaced by finance minister 
gerhard stoltenberg 
scholz had no military experience prior to his appointment in 
may and often was left to publicly defend the governments most 
controversial defense policies he absorbed the brunt of public 
criticism for last years deadly string of nato and west german 
military jet crashes 
political observers considered most of the other changes 
cosmetic 
the most significant was the naming of theo waigel head of the 
christian democratics bavarian sister party the christian 
socialist union to replace stoltenberg as finance minister 
the change brings waigel into the top government sphere a 
political gift to the christian socialists some observers 
suggested the appointment was demanded of kohl to ensure the 
partys allegiance to the christian democrats 
finance officials said waigel won the position on a promise to 
repeal or reform a 10 percent withholding tax that took effect this 
year and drove some investments out of the country 
stoltenberg had been finance minister since 1982 when the 
christian democratic union joined forces with the liberal free 
democratic party to take over the bonn government from the 
leftleaning social democrats 
kohl praised the work of scholz who he said was confronted 
with many problems for which he cannot be made responsible 
he dismissed questions on whether the defense ministry change 
would alter the federal governments attitude toward some 
controversial defense policies including whether bonn will support 
a nato plan to replace some shortrange missiles deployed in west 
germany 
west german defense policy is increasingly the target of public 
criticism and discontent because of the number of nato maneuvers 
and lowlevel flying missions allowed to take place over densely 
populated areas 
we are in intensive discussions with our coalition partners 
and the alliance the chancellor said he refused to elaborate 
the government appointments take effect april 21 kohl said 
other toplevel changes included the naming of kohls chief of 
staff wolfgang schaeuble as interior minister to replace 
friedrich zimmermann who will take over the transport ministry 
kohls new chief of staff will be rudolf seiters current head 
of the partys parliamentary delegation 
transport minister juergen warnke replaces hans klein as 
minister for economic cooperation klein will be the new government 
spokesman which has been elevated to ministerial level 
the current head of the government press and information office 
and kohls chief spokesman friedhelm ost resigned and is reported 
to be considering offers in the private sector 
construction minister oscar schneider was assigned to oversee 
the governments controversial national museum projects in bonn and 
berlin he will be replaced by parliamentarian gerda hasselfeldt 
who brings the number of women in kohls 19member cabinet to three

gpa group ltd says it plans to buy us 
and european airplanes and engines worth up to 20 billion in what 
would be the largest single aircraft order in history 
gpa one of the worlds largest and fastest growing aircraft 
leasing companies said wednesday it would announce details of the 
deal in simultaneous announcements tuesday in new york london and 
paris 
the companys chief operating officer james m king said he is 
ordering a mix of airplane models manufactured by boeing co and 
mcdonnell douglas corp of the united states and the european 
consortium airbus industrie 
the manufacturers tell us this would make it the biggest 
aircraft order in aviation history king said 
king said the aircraft that gpa will buy include widebodied and 
narrowbodied planes and engines 
the order includes engines supplied by pratt and whitney of the 
united states britains general electric co which has no links 
with general electric of the united states and rollsroyce plc of 
britain it also includes engines supplied by the international 
aero engines consortium which includes japanese companies and the 
francous cfm international group of enginemakers 
analysts said the order is expected to exceed 200 planes and 
would be worth almost 20 billion 
asked about these figures king said while i cannot confirm a 
precise number to you the suggestion is substantially correct 
its in the region of 200 aircraft 
king indicated that a figure somewhere between 11 billion and 
20 billion would be nearer the total value of the gpa order 
the largest previous such order was by delta airlines of the 
united states last september delta placed an order worth 105 
billion with options for a total of 225 boeing and 
mcdonnelldouglas aircraft 
the engineer magazine reported that rollsroyce will supply 
engines for 50 boeing 757s likely to feature in the gpa order 
british aerospace will make the wings for the airbus a330s and 
a320s which may also be fitted with rollsroyce engines the 
magazine said gpa has already ordered 40 a320s 
mcdonnell douglas could also win orders for md11 and md80 
aircraft and the former may also carry rollsroyce engines the 
magazine said 
tony ryan the head of gpa said the deal would leave the 
company three times larger than its nearest competitors in the 
aircraft leasing field 
gpa formerly called guinness peat aviation currently owns or 
leases 172 aircraft with a net value of about three billion dollars 
operating with 64 carriers in 32 countries 
gpa founded by ryan in the mid1970s is privately owned 
a recent report by londonbased investment bankers salomon 
brothers international ltd valued gpa at more more than 1 
billion the companys net profits for 198889 are expected to 
total 150 million against 101 million for 198788 
gpa has indicated it was considering going public ryan holds 10 
percent of gpas shares other big shareholders include air canada 
the irish airline aer lingus mitsubishi trust and banking of 
japan and the prudential insurance co of the united states

a federal judge has dismissed charges against 
penny stock mogul meyer blinder his son and his brokerage and 
chastised the securities and exchange commission for misconduct in 
a 1983 civil case 
us district judge lewis babcock on wednesday ordered that no 
documents or testimony obtained in the case could ever again be 
used by the sec in court against blinder his son larry and 
blinder robinson amp co 
the judge awarded attorney fees to blinder 
blinder robinson amp co was accused of not keeping correct books 
and records required by the sec when securities are traded the sec 
had sought an immediate injunction against the firm but a federal 
judge ordered a trial 
blinder attorney philip lowery said the brokerage was going from 
a manual system to a computer system in 1983 when the sec said the 
books were out of date 
the court found that in pretrial actions the sec had failed to 
comply with a court order and had not acted in good faith 
robert davenport sec regional administrator in denver said he 
could not recall such a sanction being imposed on the sec which 
has 60 days appeal 
in february the us supreme court rejected blinders challenge 
to the secs power to crack down on fraud stemming from 1980 sec 
sanctions restricting his activities 
blinder began his business in westbury long island and moved 
its headquarters to denver in the late 1970s it became one of the 
nations leading underwriters of penny stocks or lowpriced 
securities 
the sec in 1980 accused blinder and the firm of deceiving 
investors in underwriting a 25 million sale of stock in american 
leisure corp intended to finance construction and operation of a 
casino hotel in atlantic city nj 
a federal judge in denver ruled in 1982 the firm defrauded 
investors by withholding important information and barred blinder 
and his firm from engaging in similar practices

a house banking subcommittee today amended 
president bushs savings and loan bailout plan to allow banks to 
immediately begin buying up both insolvent and healthy thrift 
institutions 
in deference to small banks and the thrift industry bush had 
proposed allowing banks to buy only ailing sampls for the next two 
years and healthy ones as well after that 
but reps stan parris rva and mary rose oakar dohio 
claimed support from both the administration and the federal 
reserve for their amendment which was approved on a voice vote by 
the 47member house banking committees financial institutions 
subcommittee 
the one question we are repeatedly asked is what are we doing 
to bring more capital into a capitaldeficit industry said rep 
doug barnard dga this is the one thing we can do 
opponents expressed fears that allowing wholesale bank takeovers 
of sampls will concentrate too much market power in the banks 
decrease the amount of money available for home loans and 
ultimately raise the taxpayer share of the bailouts costs 
rep john lafalce dny predicted that banks will buy only 
healthy sampls saying they should at least be required to take over 
an insolvent thrift for each financially sound one that they 
purchase 
the government is going to be stuck with every unhealthy 
thrift in existence and the publics going to be stuck with 
additional millions of dollars in paying off their depositors 
said the subcommittees chairman rep frank annunzio dill who 
opposed the amendment 
while the house panel continued altering bushs 90 billion 
bailout package the senate banking committee approved it wednesday 
night after bowing to the administration on virtually every major 
dispute 
all 21 members of the panel voted wednesday to support the 
package after its chairman sen donald w riegle jr dmich 
lost an 1110 vote that would have rejected the administrations 
proposal for keeping 50 billion in sampl spending out of the budget 
deficit 
riegle had sought to include the spending in the budget and 
borrow the money through the treasury he contended that would have 
saved taxpayes 45 billion in interest payments over 30 years 
compared with bushs proposal to borrow the money through a new 
quasigovernment agency 
the administration vigorously opposed riegles plan contending 
congress would be tempted to use it to evade deficit limits for 
many other programs treasury secretary nicholas f brady promised 
to recommend a presidential veto if riegles plan was adopted 
the full senate is scheduled to begin debate on the legislation 
monday with a vote expected by wednesday 
the senate banking committee also passed most of the revisions 
sought by bush to accompany the bailout and prevent a repeat of the 
financial crisis 
the key according to the administration is a requirement that 
sampl owners back their lending with more of their own capital 
beginning in june 1991 the administration would like to forbid 
growth by sampls that do not meet the capital standard but the 
committee decided to permit those institutions to grow 5 percent to 
7 percent a year through lending in home mortgages 
obviously we dont like growth for undercapitalized thrifts 
said assistant treasury secretary david w mullins one of the 
architects of the bush plan weve learned hard lessons from it 
in the past 
but overall he said the senate capital standard was a good 
solid approach 
the senate committee also restructured the regulatory 
bureaucracy along the lines suggested by the administration 
placing a onceindependent sampl regulatory agency under the treasury 
department 
however in an administrationapproved compromise it created a 
separate independent agency to oversee the lending function of the 
regional federal home loan banks which borrow money at low 
governmentbacked rates and lend it to individual sampls 
the house subcommittee voted 2716 wednesday to approve an 
amendment by parris that permits sampls to continue using deposits in 
subsidiaries investing in risky areas such as commercial real 
estate development fast food franchises and junk bonds 
the house panel also adopted a measure requiring the government 
to offer some of the repossessed property from failed sampls for 
housing poor people

japans finance ministry is investigating a 
possible new technical irregularity in the purchase of 324 million 
shares of a japanese auto lighting company by us corporate 
takeover specialist t boone pickens jr news reports said 
thursday 
the reports said the ministry had discovered that the azabu auto 
group from which pickens bought his 202 percent share in koito 
manufacturing co originally did not report to authorities it had 
bought more than a 10 percent interest in the lighting firm 
failure to make such a report could be a violation of japans 
securities and exchange law 
the news reports said the problem was discovered through 
documents furnished by the azabu group after the ministry began a 
formal inquiry last week into the sale of the shares 
an official in the finance ministrys securities market division 
said i cant comment we are still in the midst of our 
investigation 
pickens purchase of the stock which makes him the largest 
shareholder has been widely described as a possible greenmail 
or takeover attempt 
in greenmail a hostile corporate suitor makes his profits when 
his stock is purchased at a premium by the target company or 
another shareholder friendly to the firm 
the azabu group which reportedly has targeted other japanese 
companies for greenmail in the past bought 48 million shares of 
koito in 1988 a large block of those shares was registered under 
the name of t boone pickens as of march 31 1989 
the secondlargest stockholder toyota motor corp holds 191 
percent of koitos stock 
koito said tuesday it had temporarily suspended the name 
transfer registrations for certificates for stock bought by boone 
co a pickenscontrolled investment firm due to another legal 
problem 
a koito official said pickens designate may have filed an 
inapproriate application with the finance ministry regarding the 
purchase by failing to state that the company was involved in the 
manufacture of defensesensitive parts koito officials said is 
engaged in militaryrelated aircraft parts production 
a boone co spokesman has said its interest in koito is not 
hostile

tax deadline time always compels some americans 
to make financial resolutions aimed at saving more of their 
hardearned bucks for a new house or their childrens education 
despite their intentions uncle sam isnt coaxing them too much 
since many incentives disappeared when congress revamped the tax 
law three years ago 
wall street firms and banks seeking new sources of money have 
been lobbying to get those tax breaks back 
the tradeoff hasnt worked said jeffrey m schaeffer 
director of research for the securities industry association a 
lobby group of brokerage companies the government thought if you 
lowered marginal rates that would create the incentive to save and 
invest 
it may well be we have to think that over 
the tax reform act of 1986 lowered the maximum individual tax 
bracket to 33 percent from 50 percent but it also eliminated many 
deductions and preferential items the changes included 
restrictions on individual retirement accounts and ended the 
favorable treatment on capital gains and losses 
groups such as the american bankers association want the 
government to restore ira benefits so anyone can deduct annual 
contributions of up to 2000 individuals can still make 
taxdeferred contributions but only those who arent covered by 
company pension plans can take the deductions under the revised tax 
code 
the sia has been keeping busy lately its officers testified 
before the house ways and means committee this past week that 
capital gains on stocks should be taxed differently from ordinary 
income before tax revision the maximum rate on capital gains had 
been 20 percent 
the group also is pushing for changes in the way stock dividends 
are taxed arguing that the current system imposes what amounts to 
a double levy not only do stockholders pay taxes on dividends the 
sia says but corporations also are taxed since they cant deduct 
these payouts from their taxable income the way they can for the 
interest on bonds they issue 
lobbying groups and others concede that its doubtful the tax 
changes they desire will happen soon 
i dont look for the government to be giving anybody any 
breaks in the near future said jay goldinger a principal with 
the beverly hills calif investment banking firm capital insight 
inc its a reactionary body not one that anticipates a 
problem 
some financial analysts disagree on whether ira deductions and 
preferential capital gains treatment had encouraged nonwealthy 
taxpayers to sock more money away in the first place 
i think that the history of tax legislation aimed at spurring 
savings has so far been fruitless said edward yardeni chief 
economist for prudentialbache securities inc who believes that 
changing demographics not government intervention will prompt 
americans to save more 
weve had the iras weve reduced the tax rates even 
inflation has come down thanks to government policies yet the 
savings rate continued to fall through 1987 
the nations personal savings rate which pales in comparison 
with those in industrial rivals such as japan and west germany has 
been declining over the past 20 years after rising during the 1950s 
and early 60s 
in 1987 it hit a 40year low of 32 percent of aftertax income 
then bounced back to 42 percent last year 
the downward trend reflects what economists called poor personal 
planning for the future and they say it could have serious 
implications for the economy the savings rate represents billions 
of dollars that can be loaned for reinvestment and business growth 
some analysts say big changes have to be made to get people to 
save or invest more especially for things like new homes or a 
college education the government already provides incentives for 
those saving for their retirement offering tax deductions on 
things such as employeesponsored 401k savings plans and keogh 
programs for the selfemployed 
some groups though say more needs to be done to take care of 
current needs the national association of home builders for 
example would like to see a housing equivalent of iras or 
something that would allow the interest on savings to be 
taxdeferred if earmarked for the purchase of a house 
william schreyer chairman of merrill lynch amp co has proposed 
giving ira savers the right to withdraw money from their accounts 
for home ownership medical care or education without having to 
pay taxes on the proceeds

all signs are pointing to a formal 
announcement on friday that white house and congressional 
negotiators have agreed on a fiscal 1990 budget bearing a deficit 
of about 100 billion 
bargainers resumed their private meetings in a capitol office 
today with the two sides hoping to give final shape to a deal on 
the 12 trillion spending plan 
the ranking republican on the house budget committee rep bill 
frenzel of minnesota said the plan was to complete work on the 
pact today if we have to go all night 
the talks broke off early wednesday evening because some of the 
participants had other appointments but one source knowledgeable 
about the sessions said a final agreement could probably have been 
reached had the negotiations lasted another 30 minutes 
another source said that house leaders have been told to expect 
to go to the white house on friday for a public announcement of a 
pact 
im very hopeful actually optimistic that we will have an 
agreement this week house majority leader thomas foley dwash 
said after thursdays meeting 
asked if bargainers would go to the white house today for an 
announcement of a deal senate budget committee chairman james 
sasser dtenn said i think we probably will go friday 
the deficit for the current fiscal year which ends sept 30 is 
expected to surpass 170 billion but due largely to optimistic 
economic assumptions used by the white house and accepted by 
congress budget writers say they need to find only 28 billion in 
savings to chop next years red ink to 100 billion the 
grammrudman law would trigger automatic spending cuts if the 
deficit surpasses that amount by more than 10 billion 
some lawmakers are already acknowledging that the talks will not 
produce the profound budget reductions that some legislators 
economists and others say are necessary to take a meaningful bite 
out of the governments fiscal problems 
i dont think anybodys expectations ought to be driven to the 
point of expecting a dramatic and breathtaking announcement said 
foley 
the deal would achieve half of its savings by reducing 
anticipated spending and half by raising revenues 
tentative revenue agreements include nearly 6 billion by 
selling federal assets 56 billion from new taxes and much of the 
rest from raising fees for various government services 
president bush pledged during last falls campaign not to raise 
taxes and battles between him and the democraticcontrolled 
congress can be expected over where the new taxes will come from 
bush has favored reducing the capital gains tax which he says 
would stimulate the economy and raise revenues next year by 48 
billion democrats say the proposal is a moneylosing boon to the 
rich 
in the spending area more than 7 billion would come from 
slowing the rate of growth in programs that automatically provide 
benefits to recipients such as a savings of more than 25 billion 
in the medicare program that provides health care for the elderly 
accounting gimmicks are expected to provide much of the 
remaining savings such as 2 billion in savings by moving the us 
postal service offbudget 
defense spending would be about 300 billion approximately the 
same as bush proposed in the budget he presented to congress in 
february 
once an agreement is announced congress would have to enact a 
budget resolution containing the pacts language a process 
expected to take weeks by law that resolution which does not 
need the presidents signature is supposed to be completed by 
april 15 the deadline is never achieved and there is no legal 
penalty for that failure 
even with a resolution in place separate bills would have to be 
passed to actually enact the spending and taxing decisions reached 
this week that work will take months and probably will not be 
finished until at least the oct 1 start of fiscal 1990

those creditcard slurping electronic creatures that can do your 
banking and spit out airline tickets at the departure gate are 
moving onto roadways to fill your tank and could become the 
primary auto fueling pits of tomorrow 
phantom or ghost stations as they are sometimes called 
are appearing across texas arizona and minnesota beckoning 
motorists with cheaper prices and signs like first fuel bank and 
auto fuel co 
like selfservice stations two decades ago these computerized 
peoplefree stations have been spreading slowly but experts 
predict their use nationwide is inevitable 
theres no question about it its going to be a very big part 
of gas marketing in the future says david morehead spokesman 
for the petroleum marketers association of america which 
represents about 10000 us retailers and wholesalers its the 
next logical step in the process 
unattended fueling is nothing new but until recently fire codes 
restricted it to private and commercial users 
arizona fire inspector burt wright was a pioneer in pushing for 
changes that opened unattended fueling to the public two years ago 
a study that led to the revision of national fire codes showed 
that safety records were best at service stations with no 
attendants and worst at those stations where an attendant did the 
pumping wright says 
at an unattended pump there is total attention to one thing 
pumping gas youre not usually distracted by pumping gas into two 
or three different cars or checking oil or tires he says 
in the 1960s when attended selfservice stations were 
controversial the fear was consumer carelessness could lead to 
explosions and fires but wrights study produced no evidence to 
support that fear 
its the public whos pumping the gas in the private locations 
and thats ok but its not ok for them to do it in a public 
location thats absurd he says 
new fire codes set specifications for equipment including 
automatic shutoffs in case of accidents and special alarm systems 
including telephones to tap into emergency locations they require 
regular inspections and prominent posting of operating and 
emergency instructions 
cynthia condon vice president of pacific pride services inc of 
salem ore which caters to commercial fleets in six western 
states believes the time is right for unattended fueling 
people have come to trust machines over people she says 
moreover consumers have come a long way from the days of brand 
loyalty prices now dictate consumer preference and the elimination 
of people means lower costs and more competitive pricing 
first fuel bank inc in st cloud minn for example normally 
prices its gasoline 2 to 5 cents below rivals founder jim feneis 
says 
ghost stations operate much like automated bank tellers or 
computerized airline ticketing machines at airports customers 
insert a plastic credit card punch in an identification number and 
pump the gas at the end of the month they receive a sophisticated 
statement much like a bank statement 
opposition to unattended fueling has come primarily from service 
station owners 
theyre dead set against it basically because its going to 
put several of them out of a job says jim egan fire protection 
design technician for the city of tucson which allows unattended 
fueling 
although the business is now dominated by independents major 
oil companies are window shopping 
arco and exxon came into town and asked if we would allow it 
about a year ago and asked for a list of all the closed up 
stations wright says 
for now the independents are enjoying life without the majors 
auto fuel co based in abilene texas has 18 stations in texas 
and arizona and is acquiring abandoned service station sites in 
the sun belt says roger bryant vice president of operations auto 
fuel plans to open 600 ghost stations in the next few years 
the biggest boon to marketers may be new federal regulations 
requiring tougher standards on underground storage tanks and 1 
million minimum insurance even for the smallest tank owners 
the reality for most of the small operators is they cant 
afford it says morehead 
a survey last year showed that many owners could afford to 
upgrade tanks but more than 27000 stations will close because of 
the insurance costs morehead says 
pioneers in unattended retailing say that by the time tank 
owners spend the money to upgrade their equipment they will be 
able to operate as a fully automated system 
feneis is using the new regulations as a marketing tool to lure 
commercial fleets offering to buy and remove existing equipment if 
the fleet signs up as a first fuel customer 
like selfservice stations ghost stations have been slow to 
catch on in 1972 self serve represented only 2 percent of the 
industry today it represents 80 percent industry figures show 
statistics are scarce on the number of unattended retailers the 
american petroleum institute which represents major oil producers 
and refiners says the numbers are very small and that the 
concept is experimental 
robert n renkes executive vice president of petroleum 
equipment institute in tulsa okla says that while sales are up 
on cardoperated equipment states will act slowly in tailoring 
their fire codes to national codes new jersey and oregon dont 
even allow attended selfservice yet he says 
for now the two biggest questions involve profitability and 
public acceptance 
the equipment is there the equipment is safe everything is 
ready now the marketer has to figure out if he can make a go of 
it says renkes who believes unattended makes good economic 
sense particularly in remote locations 
as the minimum wage rises and fringe benefits become costlier 
it will cost more to have attendant operations he says 
lw locke owner and president of eastern petroleum corp in 
enfield nc doesnt believe ghost stations can be profitable 
catering to the general public alone locke wont sign up any 
customer using less than 500 of gas a month feneis in minnesota 
believes if you offer the right price youll get a profitable 
balance of public and commericial customers 
but will the public accept them many convenience storegasoline 
station operators say no they believe people want food along with 
fuel but ghost marketers like feneis believe enough people prefer 
lower gasoline prices and fast convenient service 24 hours a day 
all year round 
bryants auto fuel is taking the safe route placing ghost pumps 
in strategic areas and cutting expenses by sharing property costs 
we share the real estate like a fast food place or a quick 
lube but they dont share our business bryant says 
he predicts ghost pumps will begin appearing in unconventional 
places perhaps outside a florist shop or anyplace where there 
is unused real estate 
end adv for sunday april 16

if you ask jim feneis hell say first fuel is the only way to 
go once youve done it 
first fuel bank inc of st cloud minn is one of a growing 
number of unattended cardoperated gasoline stations with a big 
difference 
it dispenses gasoline at competitive prices along with the 
opportunity for customers to shelter themselves against higher fuel 
costs 
were the first marketer in the country offering pricelocked 
future purchases to the end user like a futures market feneis 
said in a telephone interview 
he is president and cofounder with brother dan of first fuel 
bank where customers make cash deposits for predetermined amounts 
of gasoline and lock in the price on the day of purchase 
the amount is recorded in a computerized account and customers 
receive a card programmed for any of the companys outlets for a 1 
onetime fee 
you decide how much of a deposit you want to put into your 
account says feneis you can lock it in for the next day the 
next week or the next five years 
ffbs commercial and retail customers take delivery whenever 
their tanks run dry or until theyve used up their prepaid amount 
when the computer automatically shuts down 
ffbs payinadvance system means the company has no bad credit 
problems and peoplefree sites save on labor costs so ffb can 
offer competitive prices and still make money 
the two biggest enemies of a retail marketer is loss due to 
wasted labor and loss due to bad credit says feneis 
owning its own freight service and large storage facilities 
helps cut down on overhead expenses 
if operated correctly you can shave 20 percent off normal 
costs feneis says 
cards issued to ffb customers operate the gas pumps similar to 
automated bank teller machines each time customers draw from their 
account the amount is deducted much like withdrawing from a 
checking or savings account 
at the end of the month customers receive a sophisticated 
statement showing the time of day and type of vehicle fueled the 
odometer reading and who bought the gas it also enables users to 
figure milespergallon for each tankful of gasoline and each 
vehicle for the month the system also can be customdesigned to 
allow fueling only once a day for example 
fleet managers who first accepted the statements as a luxury 
now insist they are a necessity feneis says besides eliminating 
pilferage the accounting system gives fleet managers maximum 
control of their gas purses 
i tell the customer our system can account for every drop of 
the companys fuel he says 
recently ffbs price was 909 cents a gallon for all grades of 
gasoline at nearby attended selfserve stations prices were 939 
cents for unleaded and 959 for regular 
about 80 percent of first fuel customers are private motorists 
and 20 percent are fleet accounts 
feneis 34 and his brother 28 opened their first unattended 
automated site in 1982 
since then ffbs customer base has grown from four family 
members to 4200 accounts including about 14000 vehicles today 
it has three fueling sites 54 hoses and a fourth site planned 
along the way feneis had to live down the jibes of selfservice 
competitors who said the unpeopled sites would never catch on 
when they did he was challenged by the minnesota service station 
association 
he also had to figure out a way around minnesota law which 
doesnt allow unattended operations open to the general public 
he did it by making each customer a member of a private club 
which is technically legal 
new customers are taken through a training program to learn 
safety procedures and how to operate the pumps and emergency 
equipment 
they have to sign something saying youre now your own 
attendant so if fuel is being dispensed there there is an 
attendant there feneis says

potentially worrisome data showing an acceleration in the 
underlying rate of increase of british average earnings to close 
only slightly lower thursday 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index closed down 
43 points or 02 percent at 20287 at its best the index was 
down 16 points at late afternoon after having dropped 149 points 
at midmorning 
light volume of 4630 million shares was little changed from 
wednesdays 4679 million shares 
while the implications of the data could still return to haunt 
the market dealers said there was a lack of selling pressure as 
participants awaited much more important economic statistics due 
friday 
those include the british retail price index for march followed 
later in the day by the us producer price index for march and the 
us trade report for february 
thursday figures showed that average earnings in britain grew at 
an underlying annual rate of 9 percent in february compared with 
9 percent in january 
the figures were unequivocal bad news said robin aspinall 
a market analyst at schroder securities but he said friday is a 
much more important day there is hardly anybody out there who is

big three automaker sales shot up 265 percent in 
early april when incentives were in full force compared with last 
year when the deals had expired the companies said thursday 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp said 
cars and light trucks sold at an average daily rate of 34931 
during the april 110 period this year compared with a rate of 
27621 last year 
car sales soared 276 percent and sales of light trucks were up 
246 percent during the period 
late last month ford and gm announced new incentive packages 
featuring 29 percent interest on twoyear loans and increased 
rebates chrysler got into the fray april 3 going one step further 
to interestfree financing on twoyear loans for all of its cars 
while incentives surely contributed to some of the early april 
sales boom some of the increase is attributable to slow sales 
during the period last year incentives in effect during the first 
quarter of 1988 expired march 31 persuading consumers planning 
spring or summer purchases to make them earlier 
march and april typically are hot carselling months as 
americans get ready for summer vacations but march sales were 
lower than expected giving rise to the new incentive packages

now that his 464 million deal with peter v 
ueberroth has collapsed eastern airlines boss frank lorenzo said 
today he is turning his attention to his plan to reorganize eastern 
as a much smaller airline 
weve had our deal weve looked at the sale alternatives 
lorenzo said in a speech at the university club in manhattan 
under his new plan strikebound eastern will be a lot 
smaller said lorenzo the chairman of easterns parent texas air 
corp however he asserted we are not going to have any 
difficulty over time building back 
at a separate speaking engagement a few blocks away ueberroth 
said in response to a question on the eastern situation were 
out of there for sure 
the former baseball commissioner said he had not been in touch 
with any of the parties involved including lorenzo texas air and 
bankruptcy court officials he would not try to get in touch with 
them and did not expect to hear from them ueberroth told a 
reporter after his speech on sports issues 
the statements by ueberroth and lorenzo came the day after they 
announced their deal had fallen apart thwarting efforts to restore 
sickly eastern to a full flying schedule 
the announcements wednesday came after tumultuous negotiations 
between ueberroth aides and texas air reached an impasse at federal 
bankruptcy court in manhattan 
the judge overseeing the case moved immediately to attract other 
buyers 
our agreement with texas air is terminated its finished 
its over ueberroth told reporters 
the exbaseball commissioner who had described the eastern deal 
as an historic opportunity for businesslabor cooperation when it 
was announced april 6 said his investor group did not plan to make 
a new offer 
but charles bryan head of easterns machinists union said in 
several television interviews today he thought ueberroth was still 
in the picture peter ueberroth has said its over a couple of 
times in the past during these negotiations 
bryan said ueberroth could very well come back with another 
offer despite remarks to the contrary 
ueberroths dramatic entry as a bidder for eastern and 
justasdramatic departure injected new uncertainty into prospects 
for an airline that has been largely idled and losing millions of 
dollars since its employees struck march 4 
his withdrawal doused hopes among many strikers wednesday that a 
strong new leader had emerged to take control of an airline they 
claim has been butchered by texas air chairman frank lorenzo since 
he bought it three years ago 
im disappointed to say the least said wally haber a 
machinist union official in easterns home base of miami i can 
tell you right now mr lorenzo would have walked away in this deal 
with a lot more money than he put into eastern airlines obviously 
theyve got some plans to milk some more out of eastern 
the air line pilots association in washington said the union was 
disappointed and said the problems that caused the strike remained 
us bankruptcy judge burton lifland had sought unsuccessfully 
to salvage the deal after talks bogged down but ueberroth and 
lorenzo walked out of the talks tuesday night hours before a 
selfimposed midnight deadline sources familiar with the 
negotiations said 
after ueberroth formally announced the deal failed lifland 
ordered david i shapiro the courtappointed examiner overseeing 
the bankruptcy to meet friday with him easterns creditors and 
the union representatives 
the judge also ordered them to explain on monday why he 
shouldnt invite other bids for eastern that would include major 
assets it owned before lorenzo bought the airline in 1986 for about 
676 million 
the order is based on a petition by an eastern creditor atlanta 
attorney moreton rolleston jr that seeks to block the proposed 
sale of easterns northeast shuttle for 365 million to developer 
donald trump eastern has moved to have the judge allow the sale to 
go through 
the petition also seeks to require that any purchase of eastern 
be for 615 million include all of its system one computerized 
reservation system which it sold to texas air and include 
aircraft it has transferred to sister carrier continental airlines 
lorenzo put eastern under bankruptcy protection five days after 
the strike began and has been trying to peddle the airline since 
but it was unclear late wednesday whether he would accept new 
offers 
takeover speculator carl icahn chairman of rival trans world 
airlines said after the ueberroth deal collapsed that he remained 
interested in a possible bid but did not elaborate 
in addition a manhattan diamond dealer willy censor said 
wednesday he had formed a partnership with an unidentified foreign 
airline that he said could raise more than 250 million to make a 
bid eastern attorneys declined to comment on whether the airline 
considered him a serious suitor 
eastern president phil bakes told reporters the airline planned 
to reorganize as a vastly shrunken carrier operating about half its 
prestrike schedule of 1040 flights daily with about half the 
prestrike work force of 31000 people 
the collapse of the ueberroth deal came less than a week after 
he said his investor group would acquire eastern and a 199 percent 
stake in the system one reservations system in a deal valued at 
464 million employees would have owned 30 percent of the company 
in exchange for 210 million worth of wage and benefit concessions 
the deal appeared almost assured monday when ueberroth won 
5year labor commitments from the unions but it began to unravel 
over their insistence that a courtappointed outsider run the 
airline regardless of whether ueberroths bid succeeded sources 
speaking privately said lorenzo balked at that demand 
in another development wednesday us district judge edward 
davis in miami ruled that eastern pilots were within their rights 
to honor the strike which was instigated by the machinists union 
eastern said it would appeal the ruling claiming the pilot walkout 
was illegal

wheat futures prices closed moderately higher 
thursday on the chicago board of trade amid persistent rumors that 
the soviet union had purchased a large quantity of us wheat for 
nearterm delivery 
oat futures advanced in a rebound from the previous sessions 
losses while other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly 
mixed 
similar rumors of wheatbuying by the soviets had swept through 
the market on wednesday causing prices to rise but prices slipped 
in early trading thursday following a national weather service 
forecast for rain next week in some key winterwheat growing areas 
of the united states 
talk of a soviet wheat purchase surfaced again thursday 
afternoon traders bid up the price of wheat for may delivery but 
the buying interest in contracts for later deliveries of wheat was 
more restrained 
the national weather services prediction for normal 
precipiation in most of the midwest last week weighed on corn and 
soybean prices 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 6 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 409 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
lower to cent higher with may at 268 a bushel oats were 2

chemical banking corp the nations 
sixthlargest banking company said thursday its firstquarter 
profit slipped 68 percent from a year ago but earnings rose 
sharply at another banking concern bank of new york co inc 
chemical said the decline in its earnings reflected lower 
profits from foreign exchange and bond trading and the absence of a 
substantial gain on the sale of investment securities reported in 
the first quarter of 1988 
it said its net interest income and corporate finance fees were 
higher and it had a lower provision for loan losses 
chemical said it earned 1179 million in the three months ended 
march 31 down from 1255 million a year earlier earnings per 
share fell even more steeply to 149 from 195 reflecting the 
issuance of 7 million shares in december 1988 
net interest income rose 31 percent to 5978 million 
including 176 million in payments recognized from loans to 
brazil the 1988 figures included no interest income on chemicals 
medium and longterm loans to brazil because brazil had suspended 
such payments from february 1987 through november 1988 
securities trading profits fell 15 percent to 278 million in 
the quartter and foreign exchange trading profits fell 215 percent 
to 27 million 
chemical recorded a 600000 loss on investment securities sales 
in the latest quarter in contrast with a gain of 256 million a 
year ago 
the results include operations of horizon bancorp of new jersey 
which was acquired in a merger jan 3 horizon has been renamed 
chemical bank new jersey 
chemicals assets amounted to 74 billion on march 31 down from 
787 billion a year earlier reflecting sale of some businesses 
that no longer fit into its strategic direction 
bank of new york which became the nations 10th largest banking 
concern with its acquisition late last year of irving bank corp 
said its earnings rose to nearly 1011 million in the first 
quarter up 86 percent from 544 million a year earlier earnings 
per share fell to 145 from 160 however as the number of 
shares outstanding nearly doubled due to the acquisition 
these results exceeded our plan but they reflect only a small 
part of the cost savings arising from the merger j carter 
bacot chairman and chief executive said further savings will 
be realized as the year progresses 
he said lending activities grew strongly especially in 
commercial and industrial loans income from noninterest 
activities including securities processing grew 
bank of new yorks assets climbed to 479 billion from 227 
billion before the merger

eastern airlines managements claims that the 
debtridden company can return from bankruptcy as a significant 
carrier without a new owner or its striking unions met with 
skepticism thursday from labor leaders and some analysts 
company officials say their goal is to rebuild eastern as a 
smaller more efficient carrier but some analysts say that might 
not satisfy the airlines creditors and a sale still might be the 
only alternative 
eastern president phil bakes announcing the collapse of a 464 
million buyout proposal by former baseball commissioner peter v 
ueberroth said wednesday the company envisions gradually 
rebuilding to a carrier with about 18000 employees and 130 to 150 
jetliners flying to 60 to 80 cities 
that would be down from a prestrike workforce of 30000 flying 
250 planes to 110 cities but larger than its present 4500 
employees and flight schedule amounting to 10 percent of prestrike 
operations 
we are going to continue to bring in new recruits and continue 
to build our system said bakes 
a march 4 strike by easterns machinists joined by its pilots 
and flight attendants virtually grounded the airline and forced it 
to seek bankruptcy court protection from creditors while it 
attempts to resolve its problems 
union leaders scoffed at bakes statement that eastern could 
bring in enough recruits to replace its strikers 
analysts said negative publicity over the strike which already 
has cost eastern some future customers and proposed restructuring 
plans may hinder easterns chances of climbing out from 25 
billion in debts and a decade of nearly steady losses 
a smaller airline couldnt generate enough revenues to satisfy 
creditors they said either new ownership or a liquidation sale of 
easterns assets are more realistic some analysts said 
creditors face reduced risk in a liquidation said robert 
decker airline analyst at duff amp phelps if eastern is brought 
back to life creditors continue to face the risk of their 
investment 
wally haber a general chairman for the machinists union 
claimed thursday that a decline in passenger traffic last month at 
easterns sister carrier houstonbased continental airlines 
indicated consumer distrust of frank lorenzo chairman of parent 
texas air corp 
although continental added flights on eastern routes during the 
strikes first month its revenue passenger miles fell 43 percent 
from march 1988 continental traffic was down 74 percent in the 
first three months of this year compared to 1988 
the people arent flocking to continental because of the 
public image mr lorenzo has made for himself haber contended 
lorenzo got continentals union contracts abrogated in 1983 and 
brought the carrier out of chapter 11 reorganization as a major 
carrier 
but haber said a rebuilding eastern would face an industrywide 
shortage of pilots and mechanics that didnt exist six years ago 
eastern could subcontract machinists work and apparently has done 
so with some foreign companies haber said 
but i dont know where mr bakes is going to get his pilots 
haber said 
eastern spokesman robin matell said it was very premature to 
discuss rebuilding plans 
eastern says it has been recalling nonunion workers and had 
rebuilt its workforce to 4500 from a low of 1000 during the first 
week of the strike the company had 12000 nonunion employees when 
the strike began and officials said they dont know how many will 
be willing to return 
eastern has 115 or 116 flights daily after resuming service on 
bahamas and atlanta routes this week spokesman james ashlock said 
the company has concentrated on its most profitable routes mainly 
its northeastern shuttle service and latin american service in its 
strike schedule 
the airline has agreed to sell the shuttle to developer donald 
trump for 365 million 
only 200 of 3600 pilots have flown since their union joined the 
machinists strike 
the company still hopes to gain a federal appellate court order 
sending the pilots back to work even though us district judge 
edward b davis on wednesday reported to a appeals court that there 
was no evidence to support company claims the pilots are on an 
illegal strike 
ashlock said 34 newly recruited pilots are in the third week of 
a sixweek training course 34 more are in the second week and a 
third class would begin next week 
so far eastern hasnt had to hire any mechanics to replace 
striking machinists ashlock said

the national broadcasting co operator of 
the toprated television network in prime time takes a bold step 
into cable tv monday with the debut of a 24hour consumeroriented 
business news channel 
cnbc the consumer news and usiness channel will be available 
to 13 million cable subscribers or roughly one out of seven us 
households with television and one in three with cable service 
the cable operators who have signed up for the roundtheclock 
service say nbc brings a wealth of programming experience and they 
contend the entire cable industry will benefit 
but other cable operators are waiting to see the new network in 
action before committing themselves and cable rival turner 
broadcasting system inc suspects nbcs longrange cable plans go 
beyond just business news 
in any case the debut at 6 am edt monday promises to be the 
second most successful cable launch trailing only turners tnt 
channel which offers mostly movies and started with 17 million 
subscribers last october tnt now claims 26 million subscribers 
cnbcs onehour morning show will be hosted by dave walker and 
lois hart the husbandandwife team that had hosted the 
turnerowned cable news networks prime evening news for nine years 
cnbc also will feature halfhourly market reports interviews 
with money managers consumerproduct demonstrations and buying 
tips 
at night the cnbc live program will follow a format similar 
to the networks morning show also planned are a personal finance 
show with a studio audience and calls from viewers and interview 
shows hosted by dick cavett and political analyst john mclaughlin 
cnbc live contributors will range from legal expert arthur 
miller to ferdie pacheco the ring physician of boxing great 
muhammed ali 
on weekends cnbc will air original programming aimed at women 
and children mixed with weekly wrapups 
this wont be the first broadcast company involvement in cable 
but it may be the most active connection between broadcast and 
cable 
the owner of the abc network has stakes in the espn lifetime 
and arts amp entertainment cable networks nbc also has a passive 
investment in arts amp entertainment 
larry gerbrandt a cable industry analyst for the research firm 
paul kagan associates inc based in carmel calif said the cnbc 
experience may demonstrate how finely can we slice up a niche and 
still make money 
gerbrandt estimates nbc will spend 50 million to 75 million 
before cnbc becomes profitable a development that cnbc executives 
expect by 1993 when they hope to have about 30 million subscribers 
if cnbc succeeds gerbrandt said it may be that consumers are 
ready for more narrowly targeted networks that will further 
strain channel capacities for many cable operators 
nbc president robert wrights interest in the cable business was 
wellknown long before the company announced last spring that it 
planned the new network 
the original strategy called for daytime business news and 
sports at night and on weekends drawing on nbcs vast resources in 
gathering information 
analysts noted that it would enable nbc to spread the costs of 
newsgathering and sports rights over a broader base wile helping 
the network recapture audiences that all three networks have been 
losing to cable and independent television stations 
nbcs cable venture also reflects a broader trend toward 
diversification in the media business time inc hachette sa of 
france and news corp of australia have been seeking new outlets as 
well 
but nbcs initial plan for sports was eventually eliminated from 
the cnbc project after cable operators told nbc they had enough 
sports programming cnbc president michael eskridge said 
that left business news and nbc executives felt their 
consumeroriented fulltime approach would be unique 
there already was one competitor the financial news network 
but eskridge said fnns programming appeared targeted at investors 
who follow the markets 
richard feldman director of research for nbcs cable 
subsidiary said nbc was more interested in appealing to the 
estimated 50 million adults who use banking services but dont own 
securities 
business news shows on cable and broadcast outlets have 
multiplied in recent years ranging from public televisions the 
nightly business report to cnns moneyline 
eskridge described cnbcs role this way everyone does what we 
do some of the time we will do it all the time 
his crew will be doing it from two studios in a new office 
building located in this new jersey suburb a 45minute taxi ride 
from nbcs midtown manhattan headquarters 
cnbc eventually will employ 275 staffers draw occasionally on 
reports from nbc network staffers and nbc affiliate stations and 
operate its own offices in washington tokyo london and at the 
american stock exchange on wall street 
nbc had a powerful ally in telecommunications inc the 
nations largest cable system operator which has interests in 
systems with more than 11 million subscribers 
telecommunications agreed to lease a satellite channel for 
cnbc robert thompson a telecommunications executive said his 
company also is contributing several million subscribers to the 
charter group of cnbc subscribers but would not be more specific 
cnbc got another lift when it agreed on a joint venture with 
another big cable system operator cablevision systems corp that 
would pool nbcs business channel with the nine sports news and 
entertainment programming services of cablevisions rainbow 
programming unit nbc runs cnbc in the deal 
but marquest research a north carolinabased concern that 
surveys major cable operators said it found only limited support 
for cnbc outside the cable systems in which telecommunications and 
cablevision had an interest 
the others are saying they want to see what the service looks 
like said marquest executive paul rule there is a concern 
that it may be a duplication of what is being done by turners 
headline news or fnn 
some operators are taking both cnbc and fnn 
david meister who heads fnn said he expects only a minor 
defection of a few percent from the fnn subscriber base of nearly 
33 million because of the arrival of cnbc and suggests the two 
networks can coexist the casual viewer is not going to be 
satisfied by us or vice versa he said 
turner broadcasting which runs cnn headline news and 
superstation wtbs besides tnt is less sympathetic nbc reportedly 
considered buying a piece of cnn a few years ago and later 
considered starting its own cable news network 
turner executives believe nbc intends to compete against them as 
a general news cable network and that cnbc is only a way to get in 
the door 
cnbcs eskridge denies that but turner executive arthur sando 
said his company will be watching we have had competition before 
and we are not afraid of competition he said

a sale of striketorn eastern airlines 
increasingly is seen as the only way to resolve its deadlocked 
labor dispute according to many experts who also cautioned 
thursday that employees will discover they may have lost the fight 
no matter who ends up owning the carrier 
interested buyers following in the footsteps of peter v 
ueberroth are likely to demand at least the same 210 million in 
labor concessions included in his aborted takeover plan 
concessions are just the starting point for any further 
talks said paul tiffany a professor of management at the 
university of pennsylvanias wharton school 
observers see a sale of the carrier as a facesaving device for 
unions that have locked themselves in a seething battle they have 
has focused almost entirely on the perceived evils of one man 
frank lorenzo chairman of eastern parent texas air corp 
of recent labor disputes i cant think of any that is so 
personalized and that onedimensional perspective is wrong 
tiffany said 
a sale will allow the employees to say they were fighting for 
a principle he said a period of worker euphoria will follow any 
sale of the carrier but once that fades tiffany predicted 
employees could realize theyve lost economically 
after the ueberroth deal collapsed eastern reiterated a plan to 
return to the skies as a scaleddown company roughly half its 
prestrike size if a buyer emerges who will save even some of the 
jobs eastern would cut its a big gain for the unions said 
bankruptcy attorney richard lieb 
but there is no guarantee a new owner would preserve a 
significant number of jobs harvard business school professor 
janice mccormick said the dispute is way past the point of 
victory for anybody 
the ueberroth deal collapsed due to an impasse over the union 
demand that a courtappointed trustee replace lorenzo in charge of 
eastern until the carriers reorganization plan was approved a 
demand experts said could prove to be the unions biggest mistake 
as the transaction was originally structured it had so many 
escape hatches that there was no assurance the airline would 
end up back in hands of lorenzo if ueberroth backed out said 
pilots attorney bruce simon 
but appointing a trustee sends a more subtle message to those 
versed in such legal maneuvers 
trustees while very rarely appointed typically are named when 
there has been fraud dishonesty incompetence or gross 
mismangement of a company or less frequently if it is in the 
interest of creditors or stockholders said james j white a 
management professor at the university of michigan in ann arbor 
for example in january 1988 a bankruptcy judge appointed a 
trustee to run sharon steel corp because chairman victor posner 
failed to agree with creditors restaffing the board of directors 
posner had to repay sharon 44 million which he had used to pay 
legal fees in a tax evasion trial where he pleaded no contest 
while white said he cant understand how the court could reach 
the conclusion that there is fraud or dishonesty involved in 
running eastern he noted the appointment of a trustee generally 
casts a pall over management 
if a successful buyer does not emerge experts said the unions 
could be forced back into negotiations in time 
after a long enough strike everybodys views change white 
said particularly as strikers face continued expenses and little 
to no income 
a fair number of eastern employees are accustomed to a 
fairly nice standard of living who are surely going to be in a 
bind notwithstanding their dislike for lorenzo that will push 
them to a settlement white said

energy futures prices retreated thursday as 
some traders decided to cash in their holdings to take advantage of 
recent price rises 
on the new york mercantile exchange the may contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude fell 35 
cents to close the day at 2029 a barrel other contract months 
also fell 
among refined products unleaded gasoline for may delivery fell 
130 cents to 6881 cents a gallon and heating oil for may delivery 
lost 106 cents to 5214 cents a gallon 
william byers an oil analyst for bear stearns amp co said the 
decline was led by the gasoline contracts which have been rising on 
a combination of seasonal demands and worries about the impact of 
the alaskan oil spill 
gasoline was the catalyst for the decline there was some

palladium futures prices soared to an 8year high thursday as 
new reports on roomtemperature nuclear fusion experiments 
triggered a rally in platinum futures that drove that metals price 
to its highest level in four months 
the explosive price gains occurred as scientists at the 
university of washington and in the soviet union said they had at 
least partially duplicated a university of utah experiment in which 
researchers claim to have used a rod of palladium and coil of 
platinum to harness for the first time the nuclear reaction that 
fuels the stars 
on other markets gold futures rose while silver futures were 
mixed petroleum futures plunged grains and soybeans were mixed 
and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
on the new york mercantile exchange platinum settled 24 to 25 
higher with the most active contract for delivery in july at 
55830 a troy ounce platinum for spot delivery finished at 
55580 the highest settlement for a spot platinum contract since 
dec 15 
palladium a whitish metal produced as a byproduct of platinum 
and nickel mining settled 550 to 985 higher with the active 
june contract at 17965 a troy ounce and the spot april contract 
at 184 spot prices for palladium have not been above 180 since 
late 1980 
palladium prices have risen steadily since late march when 
chemists b stanley pons of the university of utah and his research 
partner martin fleischmann of the university of southampton 
england stunned the scientific world by announcing their 
coldfusion findings at least four other groups of researchers 
have since confirmed the results at least partially 
market speculators are betting that if the process proves 
commercially viable demand for platinum and palladium will 
increase sharply 
platinum prices have been slower to respond to the fusion news 
than palladium partly because platinum prices tend to shadow the 
gold market which has been in sluggish period 
despite its positive fundamentals which include a longterm 
outlook for extremely tight supplies the platinum market was 
unable to rally until the palladium market gave it a push said 
richard levine vice president of preciousmetal and 
foreignexchange trading with elders futures inc in new york 
all this reflects is that youre in a good solid bull market 
in the platinum group levine said 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 210 to 220 
higher with june at 39420 a troy ounce silver was 05 cent lower 
to 05 cent higher with may at 589 a troy ounce 
petroleum futures fell sharply on the new york merc as gasoline 
traders took profits after four straight gains of strong gains 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 40 cents 
lower with may at 2029 a barrel heating oil was 91 cent to 115 
cents lower with may at 5214 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
30 cent to 130 cents lower with may at 6881 cents a gallon 
wheat for may delivery advanced moderately on the chicago board 
of trade amid persistent rumors that the soviet union had purchased 
a large quantity of us wheat for nearterm delivery 
the national weather services prediction for normal 
precipitation in most of the midwest next week weighed on corn and 
soybean prices 
wheat settled unchanged to 5 cents higher with may at 408 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 1 cent higher with may at 268 
a bushel oats were 2 cents to 5 cents higher with may at 184 a 
bushel soybeans were 2 cents lower to cent higher with may at 
727 a bushel

narrowly mixed in lackluster trading on the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
live cattle were 48 cent lower to 15 cent higher with june at 
7095 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent to 75 cent lower

this city proved to be an inhospitable test 
market for premier rj reynolds gamble on a hightech smokeless 
cigarette but its one of three cities chosen for testmarketing a 
more conventional smoke 
lorillard inc on thursday announced that its spring lemon 
lights would be sold in phoenix milwaukee and hartford conn 
before national introduction 
tucson phoenix and st louis were separate markets for premier 
lorillard competitor rj reynolds ended a fivemonth test of 
premier on march 1 saying that although consumer acceptance had 
been poor the idea might work in the future premier used a carbon 
heat source to pull warm air over a flavor capsule containing dried 
tobacco 
lorillard spokeswoman sara r ridgway said the premier failure 
played no role in testmarket selection 
that was a different type of product this is a standard old 
cigarette the difference is that it has a lemon taste she said 
ms ridgway said phoenix was considered a good test market 
because of demographics and location the desert metropolis is far 
enough away from other cities to enable planners to analyze the 
impact of advertising and response she said 
roland d hammer group brand manager for new yorkbased 
lorillard said the new cigarettes would be available in menthol 
and nonmenthol both in two sizes 
he said they would be packaged in yellow silver and red or 
yellow silver and green color schemes to convey the idea of a 
lemonflavored smoke 
the hintoflemon taste is a light refreshing sensation 
that can easily be associated with springtime hammer said 
the advertising campaign was created by saatchi amp saatchi 
featuring springtime themes and settings hammer said 
lorillard which has manufacturing plants in greensboro nc 
and danville va also makes kent triumph newport true satin 
old gold and max cigarette varieties

creditors led by the us internal revenue service 
have asked a bankruptcy judge to appoint a trustee to begin selling 
assets of two former billionaire hunt brothers to pay some of the 
more than 2 billion in debt built up through failed business and 
investment enterprises 
nelson bunker hunt and w herbert hunt meanwhile have filed a 
sealed plan offering their own attempt at reorganizing their 
holdings to pay off creditors 
us bankruptcy judge harold abramson set a friday afternoon 
hearing to discuss the plans as well as hear the hunt brothers 
request they be given another 120day extension on filing a more 
detailed reorganization plan he may unseal the hunts plan at that 
time or keep it under seal 
the hunts filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last 
september after a new york jury awarded minepaco sa of peru 
1346 million on the companys claim the hunts conspired to corner 
the silver market in 1979 and 1980 
although chapter 11 provides for reorganization rather than 
liquidation irs attorney grover hartt said our reason for 
asking for a liquidation in the context of a chapter 11 is we feel 
it would be cheaper and that there will be more assets available 
for creditors 
the irs minepaco and manufacturers hanover trust co filed 
their plan tuesday 
the plan contemplates the orderly liquidation of the 
property the plan said certain entities will continue to 
be operated until the debtors interest can be liquidated in a 
commercially reasonable manner 
russ munsch an attorney for bunker hunt said at this point 
the creditors plan is simply an outline and it doesnt address 
all the creditors it is incomplete 
in bankruptcy court filings bunker and caroline hunt say they 
have debts of 12 billion and property worth 249 million herbert 
and nancy hunt list debts of 887 million and property worth 40 
million 
besides the minepaco judgment the irs claims herbert hunt and 
his wife owe 300 million in back taxes while bunker hunt and his 
wife owe 700 million 
a third brother lamar hunt is not involved in the bankruptcy 
proceedings although he also participated in the silver dealings 
just last month lamar hunt and other defendants agreed to 
settle two lawsuits stemming from the speculation 
lamar hunt and other defendants which include the giant 
investment firm merrill lynch amp co agreed to create a 58 million 
settlement pool to compensate the plaintiffs who included traders 
in silver futures 
lamar hunt made a 17 million payment last october to settle his 
portion of the minepaco case under terms of that deal the jury 
findings against lamar hunt were dismissed

president bushs 90 billion plan to bail out 
the savings and loan industry cleared its second major 
congressional hurdle thursday passing a house subcommittee one day 
after receiving the unanimous endorsement of the senate banking 
committee 
the 47member house banking subcommittee on financial 
institutions chaired by rep frank annunzio dill passed the 
bill by voice vote after four daylong drafting sessions wading 
through nearly 200 amendments 
the chairman of the full banking panel rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas said he hoped to move the bill through his committee by 
april 27 and through the house by the end of may 
following a conference between the house and senate that could 
put the bill on bushs desk in early june four months after 
announcing his proposal for solving whats described as the worst 
financial crisis since the depression 
the bill would provide 50 billion over the next three years to 
close or merge about 350 failed sampls and another 40 billion 
necessary to meet government pledges made last year in the rescue 
of another 200 institutions 
the government would borrow much of the money through a 
quasigovernmental corporation keeping 50 billion of the spending 
out of the budget defict with interest the package is expected to 
cost at least 157 billion over the next decade with more than 
half coming from taxpayers 
accompanying the money are a long list of what bush has called 
never again reforms 
the key reform requiring sampl owners to back their lending with 
more of their own capital was watered down somewhat in both the 
house and senate versions but administration supporters said the 
capital standards are a big improvement over existing standards and 
survived in much better shape than they expected 
its now pretty clear that a bill will pass with enough money 
to take care of the problem in the next several years and it will 
have fairly tough capital standards said rep charles schumer 
dny who was supporting bushs proposal its better than i 
ever expected 
the administration is still unhappy however with house and 
senate provisions that would permit capitaldeficient thrifts to 
continue growing the administration sought to force weak 
institutions to shrink their operations or find a merger partner 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp which under the bill would get expanded responsibility to 
insure deposits in sampls as well as commercial banks said the 
growth loophole undermines what are otherwise generally sound 
changes in the capital standard 
we certainly see it as something that erodes the basic theme 
of the administrations bill he said its really building the 
skyscraper on quicksand 
the bills passed by the banking panels also restructure the 
regulatory bureaucracy the chief sampl agency the federal home loan 
bank board will be split up the regional banks which make 
lowcost loans to sampls will be placed under a new independent 
agency the fdic will get control of the sampl deposit insurance fund 
and what is left of the agency will become an arm of the treasury 
department 
in late action the house subcommittee voted to give the justice 
department 75 million a year pursuing criminals in the savings and 
loan industry up from 50 million in the presidents proposal the 
bill retains bushs proposed penalty of 1 million a day for 
serious violations of regulatory standards but makes it more 
difficult for regulators to impose the top penalty 
earlier thursday the house subcommittee amended the bill by 
removing barriers to the melding of the thrift industry with 
commercial banking it voted to permit bank holding companies to 
immediately begin acquiring both insolvent and healthy sampls 
in deference to small banks and thrifts which fear that the 
nations largest commercial banking companies will be able to amass 
too much market power at their expense bush had proposed allowing 
banks to buy only ailing sampls for the next two years and healthy 
ones as well after that 
reps stan parris rva and mary rose oakar dohio said 
their measure was designed to attract new investors to the 
undercapitalized savings and loan industry 
in another move breaking down the barriers between sampls and 
commercial banks the subcommittee decided to make banks and credit 
unions that concentrate at least 30 percent of their business in 
housing lending eligible for loans from the regional federal home 
loan banks 
the also approved by voice vote an amendment forcing federal 
home loan bank board chairman m danny wall to be reconfirmed by 
the senate after his agency is wrapped into the treasury department 
under the administrations restructuring plan 
the administration in deference to walls former boss utah 
sen jake garn the ranking republican on the senate banking 
committee had sought to guarantee wall the job through mid1991 
but democrats unhappy with walls decision last year to commit the 
government to spending at least 38 billion to bail out more than 
200 sampls want him removed

a former merrill lynch stockbroker 
convicted in an insider trading scandal was sentenced thursday to 
six months in prison to be served concurrently with an identical 
sentence on a separate charge in new york 
us district judge ellen burns said she took into account 
william dillons continuing cooperation with investigators in 
deciding not to add to the sentence imposed tuesday by a federal 
judge in new york 
dillon 34 of old lyme pleaded guilty last year in new haven 
and new york to single counts of wire fraud stemming from a scheme 
in which he illicitly obtained advance copies of business week 
magazine 
while working as a broker at merrill lynch amp cos new london 
office dillon profited by trading stocks that received favorable 
mention in the magazines inside wall street column he sold 
the stocks after the magazine was released to the public and their 
prices rose 
a federal judge in new york sentenced dillon to two years in 
prison but suspended all but six months the judge also placed 
dillon on three years probation required him to perform 200 hours 
of community service and ordered him to make full restitution of an 
amount to be determined by the securities and exchange commission 
the government contends dillon made 118000 in profits through 
his illegal scheme between may 1986 and july 1988 
burns said there was no need for her to order restitution or 
community service because the new york sentence took care of that 
prosecutors had also recommended a concurrent sentence 
dillon has been working since january as a carpenter helping to 
renovate homes for the retarded his attorney henry putzel told 
the court 
he will not have to surrender until june 5 
dillon paid 10 to 30 for advance copies of business week to 
various employees of rr donnelley amp sons co which prints the 
weekly publication at two plants several donnelley employees were 
fired in the wake of the scandal 
dillons mother elizabeth baird maintained an account through 
which some trades were made based on the information from business 
week the government said she was not charged but has been 
required to turn over any profits she realized 
dillon also has admitted tipping off others to the information 
he obtained 
assistant us attorney peter jongbloed said an investigation is 
continuing but declined any other comment

freeport mcmoran inc offered up to 600 
million thursday for 15 million shares of its common stock or 
about 218 percent of the shares outstanding 
the natural resources company said it will buy the shares in 
what is known as a dutch auction setting a single price between 
35 and 40 per share based on the number and prices of shares 
offered by stockholders 
we felt that to spend between 525 million and 600 
million for our own stock was an excellent investment said craig 
saporito vice president and director of investor relations for 
freeport mcmoran 
companies often repurchase shares of stock to make the price 
rise discouraging unsolicited takeover offers freeport mcmoran 
stock 3437 wednesday closed at 37 thursday on the new york 
stock exchange 
stockholders who offered shares at or below the price set by 
freeport mcmoran will get that price in cash said the company 
which owns majority interests of divisions which drill for oil gas 
and sulphur mine gold copper diamonds and uranium and work with 
geothermal energy 
every time you put money in the ground even though weve been 
extremely successful of late theres a risk said saporito we 
looked at a number of things and felt that that kind of investment 
in our stock would benefit not only the company but the 
shareholders who elected to tender and the shareholders who elected 
to continue with us 
even that was probably less than its worth especially 
considering tuesdays announcements of major sulphur and copper 
finds said terry h smith vice president of the new orleansbased 
brokerage firm of howard weill inc 
tuesday freeport mcmoran announced that freeport egyptian 
sulphur co had found a 20 million ton sulphur deposit on a 
concession in egypts north sinai desert it also announced that 
freeportmcmoran copper co inc had increased the reserve estimate 
for a mine in irian jaya indonesia from 93 million metric tons to 
118 million metric tons of ore yielding copper gold and silver 
our appraised value for freeport mcmoran prior to the 
announced major discoveries of silver and copper was approximately 
40 per share i am revising those numbers and believe that 
40 may be low by as much as 50 percent said smith

billionaire h ross perot may not begin any 
profitmaking ventures with his new company before dec 1 but may 
continue to hire employees from his old gmpurchased firm for the 
next 2 years a virginia judge ruled thursday 
the order by fairfax county circuit judge william plummer makes 
permanent an earlier order in the fight between electronic data 
systems inc and perot systems corp over perots activities since 
he left the company in a dispute with general motors corp 
perot and perot systems of dallas shall refrain prior to 
december 1 1989 from soliciting negotiating for entering into 
or performing any contract or other business relationship that 
contemplates or calls for any profitable return to the defendants 
at any point in time and involves the business of providing data 
processing or other services to customers of a nature provided by 
eds as of december 1 1986 plummer ordered 
meanwhile perot may continue to hire eds employees until dec 
1 1991 eds says perot has hired 150 to 200 of its employees 
eight of them executives 
both sides claimed victory in the decision which essentially 
upholds the sales agreement between gm and perot 
i wanted an injunction because gm never lives up to its 
contracts i wanted it solved in court perot said in dallas 
perot previously has said that he is not engaged in any 
profitmaking business through perot systems 
eds got slamdunked over and over again and we consider it to 
be a fantastic victory said perot attorney mike weinstein for 
us its business as usual 
eds said the decision was a clear and unmistakable victory 
president les alberthal said judge plummer has made it clear 
that perot has an obligation to live up to the terms of the 
agreement he signed when he left eds and he cant continue to raid 
eds for talent indefinitely this is a significant victory for 
eds 
eds said it would pursue further unspecified legal action 
against former eds employees who left the dallas company to work 
for perot systems 
perot called the threats harassment 
on dec 1 1986 gm paid 700 million to buy perots stock in 
both eds and the automaker under terms of the buyout which 
followed public feuds between perot and gm chairman roger smith 
perot could not compete against eds until dec 1 1989 
eds sued perot last fall alleging that he violated his 
agreement with gm by forming perot systems to compete with eds and 
by hiring eds employees 
under the ruling employees hired by eds after the gm purchase 
are bound by a noncompete clause should they go work for perot 
however those hired before the gm purchase would not be bound by 
the clause should they work for perot until after dec 1 1991

a former chicago board of trade floor broker 
alleges in a lawsuit that he was fired by a division of merrill 
lynch for blowing the whistle on what he said was a scheme that 
cost the exchange millions of dollars 
but a merrill lynch spokesman in new york said thursday the 
allegations of the scheme and the improper firing are totally 
without foundation 
james e zechman a former 500000ayear vice president for 
merrill lynch pierce fenner amp smith inc said he was fired after 
he told his bosses the company was disguising outside customer 
trades as house trades to avoid higher exchange fees 
merrill lynch knowingly created and perpetuated a scheme 
and improperly deprived the cbot of millions of dollars in 
revenues zechman charged in the suit 
zechmans allegation of wrongdoing by merrill lynch is totally 
without foundation fred yager a company spokesman said in a

on his own personal misconduct at no time did he bring any 
allegations of wrondoing to merrill lynchs attention 
according to the suit the board of trade charges 4 cents for 
each trade that member firms such as merrill lynch make for their 
own accounts it charges a 1 fee for each transaction member firms 
conduct for nonmember firms and individual investors 
the nonmember pays the 1 fee to merrill lynch which pays the 
exchange 
zechmans suit charges that merrill lynch funneled nonmember 
trades through its house account thus paying only 4 cents to the 
exchange however the suit charges merrill lynch billed customers 
the 1 but called it a risk profile fee to hide the scheme from 
the exchange 
zechman of suburban highland park said he became aware of the 
alleged scheme about a week before he was fired demanded the 
practice be stopped and insisted it be reported to board of trade 
officials 
zechman said merrill lynch refused his requests and fired him on

carson pirie scott amp co said wednesday that its 
board of directors rejected a 282 million offer from pa bergner 
amp co to merge the two midwest department store chains 
pa bergner a swissowned chain with headquarters in 
milwaukee sought to acquire carson pirie of chicago for at least 
20 a share in cash or an unspecified combination of cash stock 
and notes 
carsons board of directors has unanimously determined that it 
is not in the best interest of shareholders employees 
customers suppliers and other constituencies peter s willmott 
chairman president and chief executive of the company said in a 
letter to pa bergner 
during the last two years carson pirie has returned the 
company to retailing as its core business and provided carsons 
shareholders with a cash payment of more than 30 a share he 
wrote the best interests of carsons shareholders will be served 
by the company pursuing an independent course 
alan r anderson chairman and chief executive of pa bergner 
said he was disappointed with the decision 
our offer after all represents a 52 percent premium over the 
price at which carsons stock has traded during 1989 before the 
offer was made 
carson piries stock closed unchanged at 2137 a share 
wednesday on the new york stock exchange 
we have stated our willingness to meet with mr willmott and 
his financial and legal advisors to negotiate a definite 
acquisition agreement at a fair price that would benefit carson 
pirie scotts shareholders employees and customers anderson 
said 
we can only wonder what alternatives the board can propose to 
shareholders to maximize the worth of their investment in a way 
that is comparable to the values contained in our proposed merger 
proposal anderson said 
carson pirie lost 388 million in the fiscal year ended jan
