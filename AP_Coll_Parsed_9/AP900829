it seems that some of americas most powerful 
media barons the biggies whose outlets influence public opinion 
and public policy can themselves by influenced by the anonymous 
warnings of a simple chain letter 
a few of the moguls are sheepishly passing along a chain letter 
that has been circulating through broadcast and newspaper executive 
suites in washington and new york since early this year 
the anonymous letter which purportedly originated in the 
netherlands and claims it has been passed around the world at 
least 20 times promises good luck in four days to every 
recipient who sends it immediately to five friends 
the one who breaks the chain will have bad luck warns the 
letter which is accompanied by photocopies of cover messages 
written by those who kept the chain unbroken 
arthur sulzberger jr deputy publisher of the new york times 
sent copies of his letter to five friends including random house 
executive peter osnos 
youd think i would have more courage than to send it on to 
you sulzberger wrote 
a man will do anything out of fear wrote benjamin bradlee 
executive editor of the washington post who once tangled 
fearlessly with president nixon over his newspapers watergate 
exposes 
bradlee received his letter from shelby coffey iii editor of 
the los angeles times who passed it along with a brief note 
asking how can it hurt 
syndicated humor columnist art buchwald sent his copy to five 
woman friends including cosmopolitan publisher helen gurley brown 
and columnist ann landers 
ive been asked to send this chain letter on to my five 
dearest friends buchwald wrote this is the best sex i ever 
had he added a warning that the last person to break this 
chain was seated next to talk show host morton downey jr at a 
dinner party 
buchwald had gotten his copy from pierre salinger of abc news in 
london who wrote in june having received this letter on my 65th 
birthday i have no choice but to send it on as ordered i am 
getting too old to take a chance of breaking the chain 
albert r hunt washington bureau chief of the wall street 
journal attributed his complicity in the chain to his 
superstitious nature 
i dont fly on friday the 13th hunt wrote his friends i 
dont walk under ladders when my favorite baseball team the 
philadelphia phillies are winning i dont change my underwear 
thank god theyve had a string of losing seasons and ill be 
damned if im going to break a chain letter 
one of hunts recipients was tim russert the nbc news bureau 
chief in washington keep hunt and his voodoo journalism away 
from me he wrote 
look newsweek magazines howard fineman pleaded with his 
five friends i know youve already gotten one of these and you 
threw it in the wastebasket but take pity on a guy near the end of 
the food chain besides its august what else is there to do 
finemans letter was dated aug 1 his journalistic dog days 
ended the very next day when iraqi forces invaded kuwait 
at least one media heavyweight has been brave or foolish 
enough to break the chain 
jack nelson washington bureau chief of the los angeles times 
said he received the chain letter from two friends but was too 
busy covering the persian gulf crisis and writing a book to pay any 
attention 
so far my lucks been pretty good he said maybe its 
working the other way for me

the death sentence of robert alton harris 
the man closest to san quentins gas chamber was upheld wednesday 
by a federal appeals court 
harris now 37 was convicted of the july 1978 murders of two 
san diego teenagers whose car he used in a 3000 bank robbery he 
sought a new penalty trial on the grounds that the psychiatrists 
who assisted his trial lawyer were incompetent for allegedly 
failing to detect a longstanding brain disorder 
judge john noonan of the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
stayed harris execution march 30 four days before he was to die 
he said harris may be entitled to a hearing to determine if his 
constitutional rights were violated 
but over noonans dissent the appeals court ruled 21 wednesday 
that harris claims were meritless 
the majority ruled in the prosecutions favor on every disputed 
issue at least two of which are important for future cases 
the justices said courts arent required to evaluate the 
competence of a defense psychiatrists performance and they said a 
defendant such as harris whose first round of appeals was rejected 
before the us supreme court established the right to psychiatric 
assistance in 1985 cannot even raise the issue under federal law 
a judicial evaluation of a psychiatrists opinion or advice is 
not essential to the accuracy and fairness of the criminal 
process and if applied to past trials would frustrate the 
legitimate goals of the criminal justice system said the opinion 
by judge melvin brunetti 
harris cannot now obtain a second bite at the apple because 
he believes a new group of psychiatrists would offer a different 
defense the opinion said 
defense lawyers can ask for reconsideration by an 11judge panel 
of the court a procedure the court has used several times recently 
in capital cases from other states it can be authorized by a 
majority vote of the courts 27 active judges 
after that harris only remaining appeal is to the us supreme 
court which has ruled against him four times in the past no new 
execution date has been set 
out of 286 prisoners on californias death row harris case is 
the only one to advance beyond the first stage in federal court 
review which commonly lasts several years no one has been 
executed in california since 1967

stephen b dewhurst is one of many agriculture 
department employees who were notified this week that they would be 
taking an unpaid furlough later this year 
in all some 24 million federal workers are being told of the 
layoffs that will come if congress and the white house fail to 
solve the governments budget problems 
dewhurst is usdas budget director and feels closer to the 
technical aspect of the problem than most 
but a report tuesday by his office showed the plan to save money 
under a sequester plan to cut spending would have farreaching 
effects 
there would be lower subsidies for major commodities and needy 
farmers would have less of a chance to get housing and operating 
loans the report said 
perhaps as many as 90000 usda employees roughly 90 percent of 
the departments permanent work force would be affected one way or 
another by the layoffs 
it would affect chicken inspectors and economists scientists 
and file clerks highly paid executives and those at the bottom of 
the scale the report warned 
the layoff notices and other measures are in the works just in 
case congress and the bush administration dont come up with an 
11thhour rescue for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
citing the grammrudman deficitreduction law the white house 
has ordered an acrosstheboard cut of federal spending to begin 
oct 15 if no budget agreement is reached 
about 229 billion of usdas projected outlays would be 
affected food stamps and child nutrition programs generally are 
exempt from the cuts 
the usda study anticipates cuts of 319 percent or 73 billion 
from affected programs 
farm price support payments and many other usda loan and grant 
programs would be severely reduced the report said 
the report added the necessity to lay off employees would 
disrupt usda services throughout the world and especially at usda 
county offices throughout rural america producers and industries 
dependent on the availability of usda programs and services would 
be severely affected 
for example socalled deficiency payments to farmers for next 
year have been projected at about 3 billion a 319 percent cut 
would be more than 900 million 
dairy farmers would be assessed approximately 87 percent per 
100 pounds of milk marketed which would reduce cash receipts by 
nearly 130 million 
in state and county offices of the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service where the programs are 
administered salaries and expenses would be reduced by the same 
percentage more than 20300 employees of the county offices would 
be furloughed offices would be closed mondays and fridays 
dewhurst said he and others in the usda budget office had 
received letters that they would be furloughed three days out of 
every 10 
you can get a 5050 bet i suppose from people who think it 
wont happen at all and those who think cuts will be 40 
percent he said 
the office of management and budget has already boosted its 
estimate of spending cuts to 324 percent and dewhurst said that 
could balloon further 
only about 600 million of the 23 billion in food programs 
would be subject to the cuts 
food stamps alone account for around 16 billion or so but the 
current food stamp law runs out in 1991 
if as everybody expects the food stamp program is 
reauthorized it will drive federal spending up dewhurst said 
youd see the cuts go to somewhere between 38 and 40 percent 
that would put a further bite on commodity price support 
operations the farmers home administration food aid to foreign 
countries conservation research and the other eligible programs 
according to the report using the planning cut of 319 
percent farmers also would see their government checks for price 
support loans reduced by that amount 
the loans are commonly made at harvest time so farmers have 
operating money to tide them over if market prices rise later 
farmers usually pay off the loans and then sell their products for 
cash 
if the cuts are carried out it will mean about 18 billion 
less for farmers taking out crop loans next year according to 1991 
budget projections 
a 319 percent sequester would greatly complicate program 
administration and would introduce instability into commodity 
markets the report said 
in the case of meat and poultry inspection where most usda 
spending is vested in the salaries of employees a 319 percent 
spending cut was said to result in the absence of inspection 
services during a furlough of about 137 days effectively 
shutting down the slaughtering and processing industries for that 
amount of time 
the economic loss from a shutdown would result in the loss of 
billions of dollars to the american economy the report said 
further it said the limited inspection that would be available 
would not be sufficient to prevent an erosion of the high level 
of safety in the nations meat and poultry products and would 
focus public criticism on the federal government

blinding said staff sgt william salter you almost get the 
impression youre flying over another planet

once again saddam hussein met with some of the 
western guests he holds hostage an iraqi tv crew in tow 
and again cable news network aired the iraqi satellite 
transmission live enabling cnn viewers to watch along with the 
iraqi public 
so again a journalistic debate emerged should news operations 
give saddam live access to american television 
we would not do that under any circumstances said bob 
mcfarland nbc deputy director of news we made that decision the 
first day they pumped it out we decided it was pure propaganda 
none of the big three american networks nbc abc and cbs 
aired the iraqi transmission live on tuesday as cnn did instead 
they showed portions somewhat later 
cnn said the meeting was important enough to show as quickly as 
possible 
we make these decisions on a casebycase basis said cnn 
spokesman steve haworth adding that cnn understood that saddam 
would be speaking with american hostages there was no question 
in our minds this would be newsworthy 
cnn explained to viewers that the broadcast was an iraqi tv 
feed and afterward cnn featured a debate over the wisdom of the 
decisions it had made 
its a decision the other networks see differently 
at nbc we would not put iraqi tv on the air without first 
knowing what it was mcfarland said we took every frame of it 
into the house looked at it and then selected two or three 
bites 
wherever there is a hostage videotape a captive videotape 
its a decision we dont take lightly said sherrie rollins abc 
director of news information the president of abc news has to 
approve the use of such video she said 
when saddam appeared on television on thursday with western 
hostages abc joined the iraqi satellite feed live for a few 
moments after first viewing the transmission to gauge the content 
of the material 
we did air the material we did feel it was newsworthy ms 
rollins said 
but when saddam appeared with hostages again tuesday abc taped 
the material and showed only a brief portion during a special 
report by anchorman peter jennings she said 
after tuesdays coverage on cnn pati heath of detroit the 
sister of an american hostage called the atlantabased network to 
say she had seen her brother on tv 
cnn then put her on television too 
im just happy to be able to see my brothers face she 
said i hope hussein sees me talking right now 
during tuesdays meeting between saddam and the hostages whom 
he calls guests a woman with a british accent was heard 
asking saddam why he was using foreign children in something they 
cant understand 
he responded with a long answer about the threat to his nation 
from western troops but later tuesday the iraqi news agency 
reported that women and children held in iraq would be free to go 
and that saddam had changed his mind because of the concern 
expressed by the foreign families during the meeting 
i dont think its coincidental haworth said

the countdown started today for this 
weekends launch of columbia nasas first attempt to send up a 
shuttle since the fleet was grounded by hydrogen leaks 
the newly repaired shuttle is scheduled to blast off on an 
astronomy mission at 117 am edt saturday columbias sevenman 
crew arrives at kennedy space center tonight 
theres an extra sense of anticipation that were anxious to 
begin flying again said nasa spokesman bruce buckingham its 
been a dry summer 
columbias nine to 10day flight will be the first shuttle 
mission since april when discovery carried the flawed hubble space 
telescope into orbit thats the longest gap between missions since 
flights resumed after the 1986 challenger accident 
leaking hydrogen kept columbia from lifting off with the 150 
million astro observatory in may then grounded atlantis the leaks 
are believed to be in different spots 
nasa also has been haunted this summer by hubbles defective 
mirror and the malfunctioning magellan spacecraft the space agency 
on tuesday delayed magellans mapping of venus until late september 
to find out why the spacecraft keeps losing touch with earth 
nasa plans to roll discovery out to another launch pad after 
columbia lifts off 
discovery must be launched with the sunprobing ulysses 
satellite between oct 5 and oct 23 because of the alignment of 
earth the sun and jupiter whose gravitational field will 
slingshot ulysses back to the sun otherwise the 750 million 
mission must be delayed 13 months 
columbia was supposed to have gone up may 30 but the launch was 
called off because of leaks detected during fueling a month later 
hydrogen also was found to be escaping from atlantis prompting 
nasa to ground all three shuttles 
nasa replaced columbias leaky plumbing atlantis secret 
pentagon mission has been rescheduled for november 
columbias flight will be the first shuttle mission in five 
years devoted entirely to scientific research four astronomers on 
board will operate the astro observatory which will remain on 
board 
astros three ultraviolet telescopes and one xray telescope 
will probe some of the hottest objects in the universe the 
approximately 150 targets include a supernova and comet levy which 
is making its first pass through the solar system in recorded time 
scientists have had to revise astros observing schedule 
numerous times because of the delays the mission originally was 
scheduled for march 1986 but was postponed after the challenger 
disaster

a desert tank war with iraq 
would provide a formidable test of an american ground war strategy 
that relies on a combination of vietnamera weapons and costly 
ultramodern systems never tested in combat 
should the desert standoff come to blows us military planners 
believe the american forces would win but only after a bloody fight 
it is also a fight they would rather wage at night 
until iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait the us military had 
never trained with iraq as its mock opponent but the weapons and 
tactics of iraq would not be unfamiliar its tanks are sovietmade 
and it has adopted the soviet tactic of massing huge numbers of 
tanks and supporting them with heavy artillery 
weve trained since the beginning of the cold war for this 
fight an army source said recently the only difference now is 
wed fight it in the saudi arabia instead of germany against iraq 
and not the russians 
iraqs strengths are its sheer numbers roughly 5500 tanks 
its familiarity with the terrain and experience from eight years of 
war with iran 
the united states outnumbered on the ground is said to have 
superior missiles air power and groundlevel sighting guidance 
and weapons systems 
the troops and weapons that make up the united states tank war 
arsenal have been arriving gradually since the us deployment 
began three weeks ago but much of the force is now in place 
the armys heavy m1 tanks began arriving tuesday and are being 
sent into the northeastern desert where several antitank units 
already are in place 
in a tank war with iraq the united states would seek to counter 
iraqs greater numbers with a massive air assault first targeting 
iraqi groundtoair missile systems according to dozens of 
commanders pilots and tank crews interviewed over the past two 
weeks 
iraq has modern sovietmade antiaircraft systems but us 
planners are confident they could be significantly damaged by 
american british and saudi planes 
the next phase in the air according to the interviews would 
involve the air forces a10 tank killer jets and the premiere 
american antitank weapon the new ah64 apache attack helicopter 
the a10 flys as slowly as 100 knots carries missiles and a 
30mm sevenbarrel cannon it is vulnerable to enemy fire but has 
several redundant systems to keep it flying after hits and also a 
titanium tub around the cockpit to protect the pilot during what 
one a10 commander col sandy sharpe refers to as air to mud 
warfare 
the apache carries up to 16 hellfire laserguided missiles like 
its carrier untested in combat but said to be highly accurate it 
also has two 19rocket pods and an antitank gattling gun 
the hellfire will destroy any known armor in the world said 
lt col don vinson an apache pilot and commander 
apaches are considered an ideal tank killer at night when they 
can sit back well beyond iraqi range and fire missiles 
they cant see us but i can see and kill them said armt 
lt col dick cody 
army and marine cobras vietnamera choppers that have been 
refitted with new weapons and electronics also could be called 
into any large tank war cobras are armed with tow missiles and 
gattling guns 
the major cog in the ground strategy the 24th infantry 
mechanized division began rolling its m1 tanks northward into 
the desert on tuesday 
in an allout battle the untested m1s and their 105mm cannons 
would be riding into the desert accompanied by bradley armored 
infantry carriers which has a 25mm gun and slots through which 
passengers can fire their m16s 
despite their size an m1 weighs 60 tons the tanks can 
travel at speeds of up to 45 mph or more 
the other tanks in the us arsenal the m60as belonging to the 
7th marine expeditionary brigade and the m551 sheridans deployed 
with the 82nd airborne division both date back to vietman 
the sheridans which carry shillelagh missiles saw combat duty 
then and when dropped into panama during the december us 
invasion the m60s date back to vietnam but never have been 
tested in combat 
iraqs huge tank army is led by modern sovietmade t72s which 
are considered by many experts a rival to the ameican m1 
make no mistake about it theyve got more tanks than us and 
theyve got some damn good tanks a us tank commander said 
us military planners are counting on their superior air power 
the tripledigit heat and terrain of the saudi desert would be a 
factor in any tank fight 
there are some high dunes but for the most part it would be 
difficult for any great number of tanks to hide 
tow heaven responded one weapons specialist when asked about 
the desert well seem them coming for miles 
the ships carrying us tanks were asked to bring additional 
filters for the m1s which need to be cleaned frequently and 
higher viscosity oil was put on supply lists because of the heats 
wear and tear on the equipment 
it will make it a lot tougher out there in the heat said 
sgt ronald ruff of hinesville ga but when youre cleaning or 
changing a filter or something in combat you learn to speed up a

fbi agents federal prosecutors prison guards 
and other justice department crime fighters are being told they 
could be furloughed if congress and the white house dont agree on 
a budget 
the justice department is notifying most of its 80000 employees 
that they could be furloughed up to 22 days in the coming fiscal 
year if automatic spending cuts mandated by the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law take effect oct 1 
the office of management and budget has ordered a 324 percent 
spending cut from the governments operating budget in the 1991 
fiscal year which begins oct 1 if lawmakers and the bush 
administration fail to agree on other ways of reducing the budget 
deficit 
officials at various federal law enforcement agencies said the 
furloughs could make operating extremely difficult 
running the nations federal prisons on a reduced staff would be 
incredibly challenging thats a euphemism said douglas 
lansing assistant director of the bureau of prisons we dont 
think we could do it 
the furloughs could affect all 9800 fbi agents including those 
assigned to investigate foreign spies said fbi spokesman carlos h 
fernandez no decision has been made whether to furlough agents 
working on undercover investigations he said 
we will try to do our duty as best we can but to say if wont 
affect operations would be a mistake fernandez said 
furloughs at the us marshals service would have a serious 
effect probably a drastic effect on the agencys ability to 
chase fugitives transport prisoners and seize assets from accused 
criminals said spokesman bill dempsey 
we would continue the vital lifeordeath functions of 
providing security for the federal judges all over the country and 
protecting government witnesses but the other activities would 
have to be curtailed he said 
the furloughs of 3800 federal prosecutors in 94 us attorneys 
offices will have to be juggled to accommodate trial schedules 
officials said 
attorney general dick thornburgh fbi director william sessions 
and other presidential appointees such as assistant attorneys 
general would not be affected 
the notices sent to employees this week raised the possibility 
of additional layoffs if congress and the white house dont reach 
agreement a memo sent to employees of the justice departments 
management division said the unit would have to lay off each 
employee 70 days during fiscal 1991 if the automatic spending cuts 
are not restored 
the bureau of prisons plans to furlough each of its 18500 
employees for 3 days per twoweek pay period lansing said 
similar arrangements are being made at the immigration and 
naturalization service which employs 4082 border patrol agents 
and 1400 investigators 
the drug enforcement administration has no plans to furlough any 
of its 3000 agents but will stop paying overtime cut out all 
nonessential travel and purchases and stop hiring new employees 
said spokesman bill ruzzamenti

facing a tobacco shortage that has produced street 
protests and rioting in some cities moscows city council decided 
tuesday to ration cigarettes starting sept 1 
when moscow residents pick up their monthly coupons for sugar 
which is already rationed they will also get coupons for five 
packs of cigarettes per person the newspaper vechernaya moskva 
said 
that means muscovites officially will be limited to just over 
one pack a week not nearly enough to satisfy the cravings of many 
soviets a nation of chainsmokers 
however nicotine addicts with money will be able to buy more 
cigarettes on the thriving black market where a mediumquality 
brand that officially sells for 30 kopeks about 50 cents a pack 
goes for up to 8 higherquality foreign cigarettes fetch up to 
32 per pack 
tobacco coupons apparently will be issued in the same 
indiscriminate manner as sugar coupons which means that every 
resident including children and nonsmokers will get the same 
amount 
people who dont use their coupons will be able to give them to 
friends sell them on the black market or trade them officially the 
following month for an extra 44 pounds of sugar 
the cigarette shortage which began in early summer and 
accelerated this month has forced muscovites to queue up for hours 
even in driving rain at tobacco kiosks 
irate smokers have blocked traffic in moscows central 
revolution square and street protests also have been reported in 
leningrad gorky and yaroslavl 
young people demanding more tobacco food and alcohol rioted 
friday in the siberian city of chelyabinsk smashing shop windows 
and throwing gasoline bombs according to the soviet news agency 
tass 
authorities have announced price increases that will triple the 
official cost of most cigarette brands starting next month but 
moscow is believed to be the first city to resort to rationing 
tobacco 
official spokesmen have blamed the shortage on factory 
breakdowns hoarding by black marketeers and the neardepletion of 
the nations reserves of foreign currency which has forced the 
soviet union to buy 5 billion fewer cigarettes from bulgaria this 
year than it did last year 
the shortage was predicted months in advance by an american 
expert laura r davis in a march report for the us agriculture 
department she said demand for tobacco was rising in the soviet 
union which now has an estimated 70 million smokers and harvests 
were not keeping pace 
she predicted that this years soviet tobacco crop would be only 
215000 tons unchanged from 1989 and down about onethird from the 
peak of 350000 tons in 1985 
although the soviet union is the worlds third largest tobacco 
grower topped only by the united states and china it imported 
about 55 billion cigarettes in 1988 with more than 95 percent 
coming from bulgaria

the persian gulf crisis appears to be taking a 
toll on some weakhearted israelis 
shahal a private company that operates a 24hour telephone 
emergency service for israelis suffering from heart conditions on 
tuesday reported a 20 percent increase in the number of calls since 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
when subscribers call shahal we dont ask them their political 
opinion on the situation but it is difficult to give another 
reason to what is happening said erez alroy deputy head of the 
company which has more than 15000 subscribers in the tel aviv and 
haifa areas 
we see an apparent link between the situation and the anxiety 
part of their release of tension is by calling the hotline alroy 
said 
he said shahal has received 170 calls compared to the average of 
140 daily and that intensive care units have been sent out 25 times 
a day as compared to the usual 20 
he could not say how many people had suffered heart attacks but 
noted that 70 percent of those treated by intensive care units were 
taken to hospitals an increase of 10 percent

israel is trying to maintain a restrained 
stance on the persian gulf crisis despite growing fears its own 
interests will be undermined if iraqi leader saddam hussein is not 
toppled 
a lowkey posture is not easy for israel and strong rhetoric 
keeps cropping up from military analysts often voicing leaks from 
the government and from officials themselves sometimes followed 
by hasty reversals 
the dilemma for israel is that it is the united states 
bestarmed and closest ally in the middle east but has been 
sidelined in this crisis by political necessity 
washington does not want its friendship with the jewish state to 
undermine the coalition of moderate arab states it has brought 
together in response to saddams aug 2 lightning seizure of kuwait 
stuck on the sidelines israelis are increasingly uneasy that 
diplomatic efforts to end the crisis and political maneuvering by 
saddam will lead to a military stalemate 
there is concern building here that somehow saddam may get 
away with his aggression eytan gilboa a professor of 
international relations at hebrew university said tuesday that 
leaves us still facing his military machine 
a similar view was expressed by the hebrew daily yediot ahronot 
which said in an editorial that a diplomatic compromise for the 
kuwait crisis would mean that we would remain here alone with 
saddam and his mad ambitions only four minutes away from his 
missile launchers and chemical bombs 
saddam an implacable foe of israel has a millionman army and 
has threatened to turn his chemical weapons against the jewish 
state 
he also has championed the goal of palestinians to form an 
independent state in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
sparking prosaddam rallies in the territories and neighboring 
jordan 
fear of iraqs potential military menace prompted reserve army 
gen avigdor bengal a hero in the 1973 arabisraeli war to 
advise that the united states turn its tactical nuclear weapons 
against iraq 
bengal told israel radio i think the americans made a 
mistake by not acting quickly and taking chances those who 
want to take minimum risks could find themselves in a situation 
where they cannot act even though they are ready 
prime minister yitzhak shamir has tried to keep the lid on 
saying that israel has no intention of getting involved with iraq 
unless it is attacked 
he reacted angrily on tuesday to allegations in us 
publications that israel was using its alliance with president bush 
to warmonger 
who are we to push the biggest superpower in the world 
shamir told a parliament hearing we are not pushing the united 
states to any war 
still it was shamir himself who caused a storm last week when 
he hinted that a preemptive israeli strike against iraq was 
possible 
he told a gathering of american jewish donors that in the 
circumstances our major task is to prevent war or to preempt it 
and if heaven forbid these two fail and there is no alternative 
we have to win quickly and decisively 
under questioning from reporters shamir quickly qualified his 
statement and said israels aim was to prevent any military 
involvement of our country 
defense minister moshe arens too has retracted hawkish 
statements 
on monday arens told israel television that israel would not be 
pleased by a solution that left saddam in power on tuesday 
standing before two usmade f15 jets during an air base news 
conference he denied he called for saddams ouster 
were not involved in managing this crisis and were not 
setting the conditions for how to handle it arens said 
yet the question of whether israel is or should advise the 
united states to go to war is being widely discussed by israelis 
mordechai gur a former army chief of staff told state 
television tuesday that israeli officials should be careful of what 
they say because some americans consider their remarks provocative 
if we would not go to war let us not send other children to 
war and let us not bereave other families gur said its their 
right to try to end the crisis by political means 
the israeli government has already stated its own red lines 
for war a direct strike or entry by iraqi forces into neighboring 
jordan which serves as a buffer between israel and sadddams army 
israel americas largest aid recipient at 3 billion annually 
also made it clear that it is concerned with the advanced american 
weaponry being supplied to saudi arabia and other arab states 
confronting iraq 
israel is against the sale of arms to countries which refuse 
to enter the peace process with israel said a foreign ministry 
official who insisted on anonymity israel wants to remind the 
united states of the necessity of preserving a qualitative edge

the persian gulf crisis has altered 
the dynamics of president bushs inner circle bringing three top 
advisers to the forefront and diminishing the role of others 
bushs key advisers of the gulf crisis are national security 
adviser brent scowcroft defense secretary richard cheney and gen 
colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
these are the three men with whom bush consults over and over 
each day as he monitors the iraqi stalemate whether vacationing 
here at his oceanfront home or on forays back to washington 
all three are old washington hands with whom bush worked in 
previous administrations a familiar pattern for the president 
scowcroft is a constant golfing and fishing companion the one 
aide bush sees the most frequently at work and at play 
and although scowcroft has told friends he sometimes has 
trouble keeping track of the names of the first familys multitude 
of grandchildren insiders says he has in recent months evolved 
into almost an auxiliary member of bushs family and possibly his 
most trusted adviser 
by contrast chief of staff john sununu who in other times is 
constantly at bushs side has faded into the background in recent 
days sununus strong suit has always been domestic policy not 
foreign or military affairs 
sununus role in the current military and diplomatic crisis has 
been so minor that his presence wasnt even needed this week when 
bush returned to washington for two and a half days 
hes heading a delegation of white house officials who are in 
moscow helping show soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev how to 
administer an executive office 
early in bushs administration there was speculation that 
scowcroft a softspoken retired air force general who was 
president fords top national security aide in the 1970s while bush 
was cia chief was unhappy with his job and wanted out 
the speculation went that scowcroft felt a diminished role in 
light of the fact that bush himself was deeply interested in 
foreign policy and had made one of his oldest and best friends 
james a baker iii his secretary of state 
however a scowcroft departure never came to pass and today he 
has evolved into an adviser many white house officials suggest is 
closer to the president in some ways than even baker 
oddly bakers role over the past few weeks in the persian gulf 
crisis has been largely behindthescenes 
until tuesday baker had been on a vacation of his own in 
wyoming administration officials said baker worked privately to 
rally support in the united nations after the united states called 
for a full blockade of iraqi ports and to coordinate us actions 
with the soviet union 
but otherwise his profile has been a low one while scowcroft 
more and more was the official that the white house selected to 
appear on television talk shows to elaborate on gulf policy 
baker cut short his wyoming vacation to meet with the president 
at the white house on tuesday 
he baker is back and you can believe hes not going anywhere 
now said one administration official 
bush also had a previous working relationship with cheney and 
powell cheney was former president fords chief of staff while 
bush was cia chief powell was former president reagans national 
security adviser when bush was vice president the two talked 
almost daily 
scowcroft bridges both worlds serving as an intermediary 
between powell and cheney said one key aide 
while bush talks with baker on the phone sometimes several 
times a day hes constantly with scowcroft the national security 
adviser has an office close to the oval office in the white house 
and the two drop in on one another frequently 
scowcrofts emerging high profile has much to do with the fact 
that the us operation in the gulf is primarily a military one 
but aides say that it also reflects bushs trust in him 
over the past few months theres a special affinity thats 
developed between the president and brent said a white house 
aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity both share the same 
kind of philosophy and over the past year or so the relationship 
has developed a lot closer

judging by the nervous commotion inside the 
iraqi embassy the 36 diplomatic employees and their families 
ordered to leave the country probably wont be ready to move until 
close to the thursday deadline 
inside the orangebrick embassy tuesday about a dozen 
arabicspeaking men gestured excitedly shuttling in and out of 
several rooms in the reception area a small knot of people 
watched an iraqi television broadcast relayed by cnn 
the sparsely furnished room was dominated by two huge portraits 
of iraqi president saddam hussein one in military uniform with a 
beret the other in a blue suit 
there were no apparent signs of papers or other effects being 
moved at the embassy tuesday evening 
earlier in the day a request to interview some of the departing 
diplomats was denied 
security at the embassy appeared lax an associated press 
reporter entered the front door rang the buzzer next to the inner 
locked door and was let in without identifying herself a mailman 
went in with an express mail package from california 
for the 36 embassy personnel and their families who were ordered 
to leave the persian gulf crisis has been reduced to one 
overwhelming imperative packing up and fast 
its a hell of a problem now said ahmad alkiassiy an iraqi 
consultant helping the envoys with the move seventytwo hours 
its just impossible 
on monday afternoon a us diplomatic message was delivered to 
iraqi ambassador mohamed almashat serving notice that the 36 must 
be gone from the united states within 72 hours 
the move was in retaliation for a series of iraqi actions 
especially the illegal order for the closure of the us 
embassy in kuwait state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said 
the 19 iraqis permitted to remain at the embassy including 
almashat reflect the number of americans still working at the 
us embassies in iraq and kuwait 
for the diplomats ordered to leave the us message meant they 
had to feverishly stuff their belongings into boxes alkiassiy said 
the embassy had to rent three large trucks to haul between 200 and 
300 boxes of possessions to new york for shipment to iraq 
the abrupt move is taking an emotional toll on some of the 
diplomats said alkiassiy an iraqi citizen who lives in washington 
and describes himself as a friend of the embassy trying to help out 
some of them are sad because theyre used to it here he 
said 
outside the embassy an officer in the secret services 
uniformed division stood on the sidewalk in the 90degree heat 
chatting with a city policeman 
at least its not as hot as saudi arabia the secret service 
officer quipped to a reporter 
about a dozen photographers and television cameramen maintained 
a vigil they tensed at the slightest movement snapping to each 
time someone emerged from the embassy 
it seemed they might have a long wait to see a caravan of 
departing diplomats the disorganized atmosphere at the embassy 
gave the impression that the complicated move would come at the 
last minute close to the deadline 
its hell getting out believe me alkiassiy said

a random sampling of saudi female 
opinion indicates its unlikely gis will be taking home desert 
shield brides theyd need permission from saudi parents and the 
government first 
and that assumes an american would ever meet a saudi woman in 
this regulated society where females usually cover their bodies 
heads and faces in black dont drive or drink never go to 
nightspots and often accept arranged marriages 
oh yes and the groom would have to be moslem 
three women all professional fulltime workers who have 
studied abroad said in interviews tuesday that they accept the 
strictures on their conduct as part of their culture and religion 
you might think that we are not free but the definition of 
freedom is different said nahed alomari 26 a computer 
specialist 
the women all of whom were older than the typical unmarried 
saudi live with their parents or relatives 
nahed dressed in western clothes and spiked heels under her 
abaya said she would like more freedom particularly to drive and 
travel but was confident the rules would loosen up in the future 
the women in this maledominated society did not think the 
presence of thousands of american soldiers of both sexes the 
desert shield defense against iraqi forces in neighboring kuwait 
would spark broad cultural changes 
will it have an impact on my life no said soulafa 
alnasser 22 a management trainee 
the women said they would not dare mount a public protest 
against the customs for fear it would bring shame on their families 
you could bring the whole family down with you soulafa said 
despite the restricted environment the women said they resented 
the image of all saudi females as appendages of their men 
most saudi females are educated said nahed education is 
becoming essential for all women 
as in the united states many women continue working after they 
have married and had children the women said they frequently keep 
their own names and have their own bank accounts 
finding a husband is the goal of most women they said even 
though they might have to share the man with his other wives the 
moslem faith allows men to have four wives 
but the women doubted strongly they would ever marry an 
american mixed marriages for men and women require approval of 
the minister of interior 
but laila alkholari a 30yearold librarian said she and her 
friends might get special treatment because of their age 
though their culture is alien to most americans the women said 
there are benefits to their way of life their families were 
closeknit and men viewed their women as precious said laila 
if you could take the best of our culture and the best of 
yours you would have the perfect woman she said

a judge nearly wept as she gave the roman 
catholic church permission to exhume the remains of a former 
haitian slave who has been proposed for canonization as the first 
black american saint 
acting state supreme court justice phyllis gangeljacob on 
tuesday granted the request from the archdiocese of new york to 
exhume pierre toussaints body for identification by a pathologist 
and church officials 
it is rare that this court has an opportunity to participate 
in such a historic event if only tangentially the judge said 
church records show toussaint who died a free man in 1853 at 
87 was buried at old st patricks cathedral 
court papers referred to him as a model of charity who is 
considered the founder of catholic charities because he helped the 
needy for 66 years when no formal systems of assistance existed 
gangeljacob said that toussaint had lived a long and 
apparently virtuous life giving money to the poor and nursing 
the ill during the yellow fever plagues that swept new york city 
before antibiotics 
in those times the only consolation may have been the miracles 
of faith and trust the judge said her voice breaking 
indeed for the thousands of victims of the scourge of aids 
alzheimers disease melanoma and other currently incurable 
diseases the same may be true today 
monsignor robert oconnell said the church is investigating two 
miracles attributed to toussaint a haitian mans claim he was 
cured of lung and stomach cancer by praying to toussaint and a 
miami womans claim he cured her breast cancer 
the congregation for the causes of saints in rome which is 
responsible for canonization will hold investigations and a 
hearing that could take years oconnell said 
toussaint was born into slavery in haiti in 1766 at 21 he was 
brought to new york by a frenchman and his family after the 
frenchmans death the masters family fell into poverty toussaint 
secretly supported them for 20 years until the widow remarried and 
repaid him by arranging for his freedom

a spokesman for the central bank refused to comment on the 
reports 
the asahi shimbun newspaper said the central bank is considering 
an increase in its key lending rate by a range of 075 to 10 
percentage points to stem inflationary pressure because of rising 
oil prices caused by the middle east crisis 
the bank is expected to decide on the rate increase possibly by 
early next month the discount rate the lending rate the central 
bank charges on loans to commercial banks stands at 525 percent 
among the lowest of industrialized countries 
higher interest rates tend to make a countrys currency more 
attractive to investors but discourage stock investment 
on the currency market the dollar slipped in early trading on 
speculation about the interest hike but later the currency regained 
ground on a market rumor that the central bank did not plan to 
raise the discount rate said toru umemoto a dealer with fuji bank

2650 to 2680 a barrel compared with 2668 dollars a barrel

the traditional view that women who have given 
birth by caesarean section must always deliver that way is being 
challenged in a new survey 
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists said it 
found in a survey of 2213 physicians that 63 percent of women who 
attempt vaginal delivery after a previous caesarean section 
succeed results of the study were released tuesday 
strides certainly have been made to persuade women and their 
doctors that vaginal deliveries are safe successful alternatives 
to repeat caesareans said dr mary jo osullivan secretary of the 
organization 
however osullivan said because about 42 percent of the 
patients surveyed chose to have another caesarean there is a 
need to further educate women about the benefits of vaginal 
deliveries 
osullivan associate chairwoman of obstetrics at the university 
of miami in florida said vaginal deliveries are less risky than 
caesarean sections mainly because the latter is a surgical 
procedure 
in addition she said vaginal births are less expensive and the 
patient spends less time in the hospital an average of 4334 and 
two or three days compared with 7186 and four or five days for a 
caesarean according to 1989 data from the health insurance 
association of america 
the rate of caesarean deliveries rose from 55 percent of all 
us births in 1970 to 247 percent in 1988 
but osullivan noted that the increase from 198687 and from 
198788 was 03 percent the smallest rise in five years

an appeals court says the federal trade 
commission lacked authority to prohibit states from banning 
shopping center stores that combine optometric practice with 
eyeglass sales 
the us court of appeals for the district of columbia on 
tuesday ruled that the ftc had acted beyond its statutory 
authority in its march 1989 eyeglasses ii ruling last year 
an agency may not exercise authority over states as sovereigns 
unless that authority has been unambiguously granted to it 
circuit judge james buckley wrote in a ruling agreed to by chief 
judge patricia wald and circuit judge douglas h ginsburg 
ftc attorney lawrence demillewagman said the commission had not 
yet decided whether to appeal 
the ftcs ruling never took effect because the california state 
board of optometry and others sought and received a stay from the 
appellate court moments after the ruling would have become 
effective last sept 1 said california deputy attorney general 
thomas s lasar 
the states had imposed restrictions that the court said tended 
to discourage the commercial practice of optometry such as 
partnerships between optometrists and laymen use of trade names 
and chain operations combining the practice of optometry with the 
sale of eyeglasses in shopping centers in favor of traditional 
optometric practice typified by sole practitioners operating in 
professional office buildings under their own names 
the ftc began investigating the restrictions in the mid1970s 
and in findings published in 1980 indicated that these 
restrictions resulted in higher prices and reduced the quality of 
eye care available to the public buckleys opinion noted 
nine years later the ftc adopted eyeglasses ii even though 
ftc chairman daniel oliver voted against it based on principles 
of federalism and his view that the ftc was without authority to 
promulgate it

relatives of about 3000 americans trapped in kuwait and iraq 
said they were encouraged by saddam husseins promise to release 
women and children today but they had doubts about whether he 
would keep his word 
ill believe it when i see them home in this state until 
then im just praying margaret nuzum of hutchinson kan said 
tuesday her daughter soninlaw and their two young children last 
got a call through from the us embassy in kuwait on aug 19 
shortly after saddams televised meeting tuesday with foreign 
hostages he decreed that women and children would be free to leave 
iraq today 
some americans said saddams tv appearance was a propaganda ploy 
i would love to see my husband said patricia hale of 
spring texas whose husband edward is trapped in the middle 
east in another way i wish they would quit showing them 
american hostages because its just propaganda and were playing 
into husseins hands 
saddams vow broke the monotony for relatives who have kept a 
monthlong vigil for americans caught in iraq or kuwait news of 
those trapped has been hard to come by since iraq overran kuwait on 
aug 2 
kathy majerek was dealing with housework and two young children 
when the television flashed her brother hostage kevin bazner face 
to face with saddam 
just then the state department called to tell majerek sorry no 
news i told them to take a look at their tv she said from 
ogden utah kevin had the mike for about three minutes it was 
hard to hear but he said something about a peaceful solution 
in the detroit suburb of farmington hills another of bazners 
sisters patricia heath said were waiting with bated breath 
now 
she said the family had not heard from bazner since aug 14 
hearing him and knowing he is safe and comfortable of course 
that makes me feel good she said 
when the gerards of new harmony ind heard of saddams vow 
they reined in their emotions i dont want to be a downer but 
hes said things before he said he was going to let all the 
diplomats go said pauline gerard everything hinges on this 
and i dont want to be crushed 
mrs gerard had been waiting for good news since her pregnant 
sister got trapped while visiting kuwaiti inlaws i dont want 
to get my hopes up too much because i dont want to fall down too 
far if it doesnt work out she said 
michael saba founder of the coming home committee was more 
effusive 
its just an excellent sign said the champaign ill 
businessman who escaped iraq shortly after the invasion 
whether the men are soon to follow or whether thats something 
that has to be worked out isnt clear but id say the signs are 
good he said i think were seeing some signs that say theres 
some interest in deescalating the situation 
saddam also agreed tuesday to talk to president bush and british 
prime minister margaret thatcher about ending the persian gulf 
crisis 
despite the conciliatory gestures baghdad hardened its position 
on kuwait declaring it a 19th province of iraq that concerns jo 
ellen buehler whose sister is married to a kuwaiti air force 
officer 
im going to stay excited and keep everyones spirits as high 
as i can because thats all we have to clutch onto buehler said 
from memphis tenn but i dont want to jump the gun 
buehler said shes worried that saddam means only to free the 
estimated 500 americans trapped in iraq he didnt say anything 
about kuwait said buehler who hasnt heard from her sister 
since aug 3 when she and three young nephews were among about 
2500 americans stuck in the annexed country what about kuwait

students romped in a gym one minute and 
huddled in fear for their lives the next as a deadly tornado tore 
their school away around them 
plainfield high school was razed in the path of a cluster of 
tornadoes tuesday that killed more than 20 people in a eightmile 
swath in northern illinois 
at least 175 students were at the school when the tornado 
struck classes were to have begun today 
all of a sudden we heard a big boom on the roof and then 
everybody got down and the roof came off the small gym said 
shawn mazzoni who was inside with dozens of students practicing 
for fall sports 
the crash was the only warning for the teachers and students 
preparing for the school year in minutes winds ripped the 
schools roof off and toppled the outside walls 
hail and whipping winds were precursors to the tornado said 
principal jim waldorf who was in the school students and teachers 
suffered minor injuries waldorf said 
i was inside and things went flying by the window 
horizontally one teacher said she did not give her name 
steve schernerhorn the soccer coach said he and a group of 
teachers and student athletes crouched in the halls as the roof was 
blown off 
we had some very short warnings we immediately took cover 
he said he said about 25 houses near the school were destroyed 
cars were flipped over around the school the roof was scattered 
in pieces across the campus a few interior walls teetered without 
support broken glass littered the hallways 
the spot where mazzoni huddled for cover may have been the only 
area left standing the whole big gym fell down he said 
there was stuff flying all at us the place where we were at was

washington post reporter caryle murphy 
willingly traveled to kuwait in late july to cover an unfolding 
international news event she escaped a month later holding 
preciously to her stories and her life 
when murphy arrived in kuwait city iraqi president saddam 
hussein was amassing thousands of troops from his millionman army 
along the iraqikuwaiti border but still promising he would take 
no military action against his tiny neighbor 
however in the early morning hours of on aug 2 a week after 
murphys arrival iraqi soldiers quickly rolled over kuwait 
one failed escape attempt and 25 days later murphy arrived in 
saudi arabia after a tense journey across the bleak desert 
the journalist related her trials in a lengthy article published 
in todays washington post 
despite the turmoil in kuwait after the invasion murphy said 
she hadnt expected to be trapped 
like most foreigners i assumed that in a few days time 
the borders would be open for those who wanted to leave and that 
the exodus would start but it never happened she wrote in the 
firstperson account of the ordeal 
murphy recalled that she and two other western journalists spent 
the first week after the invasion conducting interviews on the 
streets in hospitals and over the telephone as if we were 
covering any story however she soon discovered that there was 
no way to dispatch material to her newspaper 
after leaving her hotel to live with an american family murphy 
decided to flee the country as the two other journalists already 
had done 
murphy and two other americans set out by car on the morning of 
aug 14 they were back in kuwait city 90 minutes later after being 
turned back by iraqi soldiers 
but murphy decided to try again after she learned of a convoy 
that was planning to leave at 9 am monday 
i decided in a minute mostly by instinct i reasoned that the 
worst that could happen was that i would be detained if the iraqis 
spotted me she wrote 
nearly seven hours later murphy arrived at the saudi border 
once there she learned from a us diplomat that she was the first 
american to arrive at the outpost in eight days

share prices on the tokyo stock exchange fell 
sharply today following reports of a possible increase in japans 
official discount rate traders said the rumors later were denied 
by central bank officials 
meanwhile the dollar climbed against the japanese yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues shed 81597 
points or 317 percent closing at 2489479 in light trading the 
index rose 56900 points on tuesday after gaining 976 points on 
monday and another 42813 points friday 
dealers said the nikkei index began dropping at the start of the 
days trading because of local news reports that the bank of japan 
would increase its official discount rate possibly early next 
month 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno told a news conference this 
afternoon that the central bank was not discussing a discountrate 
hike at the current time with the finance ministry 
the newspaper asahi shimbun reported the bank was considering a 
hike in its key lending rate by 07510 percentage points to stem 
inflationary pressures caused by rising oil prices due to the 
persian gulf crisis 
prices remain stable at the present time but higher oil 
prices are a new factor in the situation which must be watched 
closely mieno said at his first news conference since iraqs 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
mieno said there would be no immediate changes in monetary 
policy 
the central bank governor said he does not expect the rise in 
oil prices to undermine japans three engines of economic expansion 
strong spending for housing capital investment and personal 
consumption 
japans discount rate the interest rate the central bank 
charges on loans to commercial banks now stands at 525 percent 
one of the lowest among major industrialized nations 
higher interest rates tend to make a countrys currency more 
attractive to investors but discourage stock investment 
but dealers said mienos comments would not necessarily boost 
stock prices 
the governors denial of an interest rate hike will not become 
a buy factor because the market environment itself remains bad 
because of the stalemate in the middle east situation said 
kazuhiro nomura a trader with new japan securities co 
in foreign exchange trading the dollar closed at 14435 yen up 
115 yen from tuesdays close of 14320 yen after opening at 
14310 yen the currency ranged between 14298 yen and 14445 yen 
spot volume was about 64 billion 
the dollar slipped in early tokyo trading on speculation about 
the interest rate but later was bought back by a reported denial of 
the hike by financial sources exchange dealers said 
then the dollar moved higher on short covering coupled with 
cross trading in which investors buy european currencies by 
selling the yen said shigeru tamaki a dealer with the industrial 
bank of japan 
in bond trading the price of benchmark no 119 10year japanese 
government bonds closed at 8233 points down from tuesdays close 
of 8268 their yield stood at 8275 percent up from tuesdays 
8190 percent 
meanwhile north sea brent crude oil for october delivery was 
valued at 2650 to 2670 a barrel compared with 2668 a barrel 
quoted in london late tuesday an official at a major japanese 
trading company said todays oil market remained quiet

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
known more for discretion than dynamism suddenly stepped forward 
this week and seized world headlines with a bid to personally 
mediate the persian gulf crisis 
the un chief often goes weeks on end without attracting much 
notice outside the glass facade of un headquarters relying on 
lowkeyed diplomacy to solve conflicts 
then came his weekend announcement that he will meet iraqi 
foreign minister tariq aziz in amman jordan on thursday to try to 
bring an end to iraqs occupation of kuwait and free all the 
foreign hostages caught by the aug 2 invasion 
he followed up with a rare news conference monday and capped 
that with live interviews with us television networks on the 
evening newscasts 
diplomats and un officials pondered this unprecedented 
outburst by an official who is fond of the french saying the 
melody makes the song not a loud voice 
up to now his style has been a study in understatement as he 
labored quietly to bring recalcitrant enemies into peace 
negotiations 
he was perus ambassador to the united nations in 197175 and 
special un representative to cyprus from 197577 in 1979 he 
became undersecretarygeneral for special political affairs 
un insiders say that as special representative to afghanistan 
in 1981 perez de cuellar sketched the framework for the superpower 
settlement that led to soviet withdrawal from afghanistan 
completed last year 
perez de cuellar spent many hours with the iraqi and iranian 
foreign ministers in 1988 to solidify the unmandated ceasefire 
in their war the relationship he established with aziz may prove 
useful on thursday 
another long conflict the guerrilla war in western sahara 
appears headed to an end soon after years of unobtrusive un 
mediation 
the new cooperation between the superpowers is the key to the 
united nations recent successes perez de cuellar owes thanks to 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev for taking the first steps to 
end the cold war 
for years east and west tested each other in proxy wars among 
their client states and used their veto power in the united nations 
to block effective diplomacy 
during the lean years from 1982 to 1986 perez de cuellar 
could only lay the groundwork for future successes brian urquhart 
the former chief un peacekeeping offical said in a 1988 
newspaper interview 
in perez de cuellars first year as secretarygeneral argentina 
and britain fought their 74day falkland islands war 
while that conflict was still going on israel invaded lebanon 
defied security council demands for a ceasefire and withdrawal 
and bypassed the 7000member un peacekeeping force in southern 
lebanon 
the years 1982 to 1986 were awful nothing was going right 
urquhart said but he used that time to build up a negotiating 
position in afghanistan iran iraq and all those places when the 
climate changed he was in a position to go forward quickly 
un insiders also credit perez de cuellar with recruiting a 
small but highly effective circle of key aides to draft un 
policy in cambodia latin america the middle east afghanistan and 
other trouble spots 
he doesnt upstage them by launching unexpected initiatives 
which is why his move this week caught so many un observers off 
guard 
iraq had dug in its heels rejecting security council 
denunciations and calling the world body the pawn of the united 
states the un chief was away on a south american tour 
many wondered why he didnt rush back to headquarters during the 
crisis 
after the security council voted saturday to allow military 
force to enforce the economic blockade on iraq perez de cuellar 
suddenly announced his peace initiative and returned to new york 
while supporting security council resolutions demanding 
immediate iraqi withdrawal he carefully drew a distinction between 
his role and that of the council 
the security council composed of 15 nations cannot mediate in 
a crisis only the secretarygeneral can do that he said 
perez de cuellar was not in his usual seat at the council table 
when it passed five resolutions faulting iraq for its actions now 
he could offer himself as an honest broker to iraq 
some officials and diplomats believe perez de cuellars new 
higher profile paves the way for his successor to be a more active 
international mediator after his term ends in 1992 perez de 
cuellar has said he will not stand for reelection

troops and helicopter gunships killed 
34 tamil rebels in the east while government troops in the north 
inched forward along a heavily mined causeway toward a 
rebelbesieged fort officials said today 
by the eighth day of the governments offensive against the 
tamil tiger guerrillas the army was about twothirds of a mile 
from jaffna fort where 250 soldiers and police have been 
surrounded by rebels for 10 weeks the military officials said 
they said progress had been slow because the tigers had blown up 
three culverts on the causeway leading across jaffna lagoon to the 
starshaped fort located on the northern tip of this indian ocean 
island nation 
government troops have moved about onefourth of the way up the 
causeway according to the officials who cannot be identified 
under briefing rules 
in the east fighting was reported in several areas as the 
tigers pressed their 7yearold campaign to carve a tamil state out 
of the predominantly sinhalese island nation 
gunships killed 14 tigers preparing an attack on a sinhalese 
village in the ampara area the military officials said they said 
the rebels had already killed a soldier and wounded two other 
soldiers and three policemen when the gunships opened fire 
nine more tigers were killed in a government ambush in the 
northeastern port city of trincomalee the officials said in 
addition 11 tigers one tamil civilian and one soldier were killed 
in a series of clashes along the east coast they said 
the government did not indicate whether there had been new 
casualties in the north the jaffna reports could not be verified 
since communications with the north were cut after the tigers broke 
a 13monthold ceasefire on june 11 
the tigers themselves issue statements only periodically 
usually from exile offices in europe 
the government offensive to break the siege of jaffna fort has a 
far greater symbolic value than any practical military application 
even before the siege started the government garrison inside 
the fort was not free to move into jaffna town the chief 
stronghold of the tigers 
except for a couple other isolated government posts the entire 
jaffna peninsula is held by tigers 
about 850000 tamils live on the peninsula 185 miles northeast 
of colombo the capital 
at least 14000 people have died in the tamil insurrection 
which began in 1983 
tamil militants say they need a separate homeland because they 
are discriminated against by the sinhalese who control the sri 
lankan government and the military 
sinhalese make up 75 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
tamils comprise 18 percent most other sri lankans are moslems who 
trace their descent from arab seafarers

syrian troops have put down violent 
proiraqi demonstrations in cities along the eastern border with 
iraq killing dozens of people arab diplomats and security sources 
reported today 
diplomats described a massive deployment of troops perhaps 
more than 50000 to maintain tense order in the southwest along 
the border with iraq 
western embassies in damascus the syrian capital could not 
immediately be contacted by telephone syrias statecontrolled 
media has made no mention of any trouble 
but the sources speaking on condition they not be named said 
crowds of syrians poured into the streets of eastern towns on 
sunday to protest president hafez assads stand against iraq 
people waved iraqi flags and huge portraits of president saddam 
hussein iraqs strongman 
assad and saddam have been locked in a bitter ideological feud 
for more than a decade the two countries are ruled by rival wings 
of the baath socialist party 
following iraqs invasion of kuwait aug 2 assad has sent at 
least 1100 troops to join an arab expeditionary force gathering in 
saudi arabia to protect the oilrich kingdom from the iraqis 
saddams army is confronting a major buildup by us and other 
forces in saudi arabia and the persian gulf region 
the diplomats said some of the weekend demonstrators demanded 
that the eastern sector of syria separate from damascus to be 
merged with iraq 
troops tried all day to stop the demonstrations and reports 
from our damascus embassy said dozens of people were killed a 
senior diplomat said 
by monday the rioting had been put down but the mood remained 
explosive he said 
diplomats and intelligence sources from other arab states 
confirmed the information 
assad postponed a scheduled trip to egypt on sunday without 
explanation but he flew to the egyptian city of alexandria tuesday 
for a day of talks with president hosni mubarak 
the violence appears to be the worst outbreak of political 
unrest in syria since february 1982 when assad mercilessly crushed 
a moslem brotherhood uprising in the city of hama north of 
damascus 
assads troops razed parts of the city in three weeks of 
fighting in which thousands of people were killed 
the sources regarded the outbreak of violence in syria as a 
serious threat to assad a former air force commander who has held 
a ruthless grip on the country since he seized power in november 
1970 
the diplomats also saw the trouble as evidence of saddams 
growing appeal to the arabs generally in favor of his stand against 
us and allied forces in the persian gulf 
travelers arriving in jordan from syria reported clear signs of 
high tension but none who had visited the turbulent eastern part 
of the country was prepared to speak with reporters 
i know nothing i cant say anything one trucker said 
hurrying away visibly frightened

iraqi tea drinkers may soon be looking 
at empty glasses 
bangladesh adhering to a unordered ban on trade with iraq as 
punishment for its invasion of kuwait has barred iraqi agents from 
its tea auctions 
sri lanka which wants to continue selling tea to its biggest 
customer says iraq made only minimal purchases at mondays tea 
auction and none at all on tuesday 
tea sipped sweet and dark from small glasses is the most 
popular drink in iraq 
bangladesh barred iraq from participating in tuesdays tea 
auction at the port city of chittagong a tea board official said 
today speaking on condition of anonymity 
iraq is bangladeshs fourthlargest tea customer and normally 
buys about 10000 tons of the countrys crop each year 
in sri lanka which welcomes baghdads tea trade iraq purchased 
only 100 tons at mondays auction onefifth its usual level and 
made no bids on tuesday tea board chairman sepala illangakoon 
said this prompted fears the iraqi market may be drying up 
iraq said to be feeling the effects of the international trade 
embargo purchased 30000 tons of sri lankan tea last year

members of congress are praising president 
bushs handling so far of the middle east crisis but some who 
interrupted their summer break for a presidential briefing are wary 
about the future 
i dont think theres a question of a blank check here for 
the president said house speaker thomas s foley dwash but 
during an hourlong meeting tuesday with bush and top aides 
there were really no overall reservations by the 170 or so 
lawmakers present he said 
both democrats and republicans were effusive about bushs 
diplomacy the garnering of international support for an economic 
boycott of iraq the winning of united nations backing for military 
enforcement of the blockade and his enlistment of arab military 
forces in the regional show of strength 
for the moment among professional politicians there is a 
sense of awe at how brilliantly bush has handled this said rep 
newt gingrich rga the house minority whip 
congress will continue to support bushs actions provided that 
we do not get into a protracted struggle where the goals are not 
clear where theres loss of life and there does not seem to be an 
opportunity for victory said house majority whip william gray 
dpa 
but there were worries as well there was concern about where 
the line in the sand is said rep david bonior dmich there 
is no sense of how long it will last 
sen richard lugar rind said merely getting hussein and his 
forces out of kuwait will not be enough i think that leaves us 
in a very unsatisfactory situation lugar said on cbs this 
morning 
we are left at that point with saddam hussein building 
potential nuclear weapons having chemical capability which he has 
used before an enormous army that could be a threat once again 
very rapidly it seems to me important that saddam hussein must 
either leave or be removed likewise those nuclear facilities and 
the chemical facilities should be destroyed lugar said 
others said bush avoided the crucial question of whether the 
iraqi president can remain in power in his own country even if he 
pulls out of kuwait which his forces overran on aug 2 
i am concerned about what it is that we want to leave there 
said sen frank lautenberg dnj what happens when all this is 
over i think its very important that iraqs military machine be 
rendered inoperative before we can call this mission a success 
other lawmakers said they believe the administration intends to 
wait for saddams own people to overthrow him or that the world 
will rely on a longterm multinational peacekeeping force to rein 
in iraq 
rep david obey dwis said he worries about the lopsided 
nature of the international force in saudi arabia 
the germans think they have constitutional problems in sending 
troops outside the nato area the japanese just send cash said 
obey chairman of the house appropriations foreign operations 
subcommittee if we dont watch it well have a 90 or 95 percent 
share of the ontheground troops i dont think thats politically 
sustainable at home 
some participants in tuesdays briefing noting that the 
pentagon doubled its estimate of the cost so far of the troop 
deployment to at least 25 billion from 118 billion said money 
was a growing factor 
as time goes on theres going to be a strain said rep amo 
houghton rny a member of the house budget committee 
but sen john kerry dmass said on cbs that the price tag 
of not doing what were doing would have been even greater both in 
lives as well as money 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said congress and 
the president may have to scale back by as much as 15 billion the 
amount they hope to shave from the budget deficit next year 
some of that cost must be shouldered by us allies who are even 
more dependent on middle eastern oil than the united states japan 
and west germany in particular they said bush told the lawmakers 
he was working on just such a costsharing arrangement 
participants reported 
another concern voiced during the closeddoor meeting by rep 
john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce 
committee was that bush has failed to articulate a national energy 
policy that can cope with the uncertainty the gulf crisis creates 
dingell said the country has no plan to encourage domestic oil 
production no program to increase conservation and alternative 
energy sources and no standby rationing plan i must say the 
presidents response on that wasnt the strongest said rep norm 
dicks dwash 
foley said congress will expect to be kept informed of 
developments in the region and it became clear that lawmakers will 
take a more active role in the crisis in the coming weeks 
two bipartisan delegations one from the house and one from the 
senate are preparing to leave friday for visits in saudi arabia 
egypt and other middle eastern countries to review the us 
military deployment firsthand

president corazon aquino today 
reversed a longheld policy and said she was willing to negotiate 
ceasefires with communist guerrillas and former soldiers who have 
staged coup attempts 
mrs aquino also invited the opposition to join the talks 
including her most outspoken critic sen juan ponce enrile 
manila has been rocked by almost daily explosions although no 
one has claimed responsibility for the blasts the government has 
blamed them on former soldiers who have repeatedly tried to toppled 
mrs aquino in coup attempts 
the communist rebels have been waging a 21year rebellion to 
establish a marxist state the last ceasefire with them collapsed 
in early 1987 
sen wigberto tanada called for a truce between the government 
and the communist rebels after a major earthquake in the 
philippines on july 16 but mrs aquino rejected the proposal 
on tuesday a proaquino senator orlando mercado urged mrs 
aquino to put aside differences with her political foes and begin 
to discuss the nations security problems and economic woes 
enrile said he was willing to reconcile with mrs aquino who 
fired him as defense minister after he was implicated in a coup 
attempt in november 1986 
mrs aquino said in a statement today that mercado and enrile 
are welcome to join discussions now being held by a committee of 
cabinet members 
defense secretary fidel ramos has adamantly refused any 
ceasefire with the communist guerrillas since november 1986 when 
the aquino government negotiated with the rebels during a 60day 
truce 
ramos a member of the cabinet committee has been credited with 
crushing six coup attempts against mrs aquino 
communists have accused him of whipping up threats of another 
coup attempt against mrs aquino so that the civilian leadership 
would become indebted to him ramos has denied all allegations 
the last ceasefire with the rebels collapsed in january 1987 
after troops fired on farmers demonstrating outside mrs aquinos 
office for land reform

a federal judge has ordered a ban on 
imports of tuna caught by five nations until they can show that 
they are not killing more dolphins than us law allows 
us district judge thelton henderson on tuesday said the bush 
administration had given foreign fleets too much time to comply 
with a 1988 federal law requiring an embargo of any nation whose 
dolphinkilling rate was more than twice the rate of the us tuna 
fleet 
the law provided for an embargo at the end of 1989 unless the 
commerce department had determined that a nations dolphin kill 
rate was under the limit henderson said the department contended 
it was entitled to evaluate figures submitted by each nation from 
1989 an assessment that has not been completed 
under the agencys interpretation it is the dolphins and 
domestic fishermen not the foreign governments who bear the 
burden of the foreign governments late production of evidence 
henderson wrote 
the continued slaughter and destruction of these innocent 
victims of the economics of fishing constitutes an irreparable 
injury to us all 
august felando president of the american tunaboat association 
the largest group of usflagged tuna boats said the embargo 
could have serious consequences 
what it can do is really disrupt the supply of tuna to the 
us canners felando said the us fishermen cannot supply 
all the tuna thats required for the us market 
he said foreign boats caught 46 percent of the lightmeat tuna 
canned by us companies last year and all of the foreigncanned 
tuna which made up about a third of the us market 
the embargo affects the nations whose boats use nets to catch 
yellowfin tuna in the eastern pacific mexico panama venezuela 
ecuador and the pacific island nation of vanuatu 
some commercial fishing fleets deliberately drop their nets on 
dolphins which swim above yellowfin tuna to limit the deaths of 
dolphins caught in the nets us law requires posting of observers 
on tuna boats to monitor preservation efforts 
us law cannot directly regulate foreign fishing practices in 
international waters the law amended most recently in 1988 
forbids imports of tuna caught by nations that do not meet 
prescribed limits for their dolphin kills twice the us rate by 
the end of 1989 and 125 times the us rate by the end of 1990 
a national marine fisheries service official testified to 
congress last month that foreign dolphin kills last year rose by 
over 40 percent to 84000 while us kills dropped to 12643 
the commerce department argued that the law required it only to 
compile information from foreign governments which was submitted 
by a july 31 deadline and decide whether each country met the 
legal standard 
but an environmental group called the earth island institute 
contended the law required an embargo of any nation that had not 
shown it met the limit by the end of last year and henderson 
agreed 
henderson said an embargo should have gone into effect at the 
end of 1989 to be lifted only as the commerce department 
determined based on documentary evidence from each nation that 
its dolphin kill rate was below the limit 
the united states the only country that regulates dolphin 
mortality in connection with fishing allows a maximum of 20500 
deaths and stations observers on board all usflagged vessels to 
verify the number of deaths

north latitude and 576 west longitude or about 750 miles 
southeast of bermuda it was moving northward at about 10 mph and

citing new questions about police evidence the 
government today ordered the court of appeal to review the 
convictions of six irishmen serving life sentences for bombings 
that killed 21 people 
it was a victory for the socalled birmingham six in a prolonged 
campaign to prove they were unjustly convicted of the 1974 irish 
republican army bombings 
the home office said apparent discrepancies were found in police 
notes of an interview with one of the convicts richard mcilkenny 
scientific tests indicated that some pages were written at 
different times it said 
home secretary david waddington the cabinet minister 
responsible for law enforcement ordered all six convictions 
referred to the court of appeal according to a home office 
statement 
this is very good news irish prime minister charles haughey 
said in dublin relations between britain and ireland have been 
strained by the birmingham six and other british court cases 
involving ira activities 
five of the six men were arrested nov 21 1974 a few hours 
after the bombings as they were about to board a ferry to belfast 
northern ireland for the funeral of an ira man 
mcilkenny johnny walker patrick hill hugh callaghan gerry 
hunter and billy power were convicted of murder for bombing two 
pubs in birmingham killing 21 people and injuring 162 all six 
were jailed for life in 1975 
they were refused the right to appeal in 1976 and failed in a 
1977 lawsuit against investigating officers for assault a decade 
later the government acknowledged the doubts about their 
convictions by referring the case to the court of appeal but the 
verdicts were in 1988 
lets hope this time it works for us said mcilkennys wife 
kate who lives in birmingham 
i hope that the court will deal with the case speedily in 
order that this great scandal may be brought to an end as soon as 
possible said chris mullin a member of parliament who wrote a 
book about the case 
mullin of the opposition labor party claims he has met ira 
members who admitted carrying out the birmingham attack 
the bombings were the deadliest ever by the ira in england in 
its campaign against british rule in northern ireland 
the birmingham six case is the last of three major trials of 
suspected ira guerrillas from the 1970s to be returned to the 
appeal courts following vigorous public campaigns claiming their 
innocence 
three men and a woman convicted of killing six people in 
bombings in guildford and woolwich in 1975 were freed by the court 
of appeal in october six other people convicted in a related case 
of operating an ira bomb factory are awaiting an appeal hearing 
after waddington announced in june that the convictions were 
unsafe 
in march waddington asked the devon and cornwall constabulary 
to investigate certain undisclosed points raised by defense 
attorneys 
as part of that investigation the police carried out 
electrostatic deposition tests on records of the west midlands 
police force whose detectives investigated the birmingham bombings 
a year ago west midlands chief constable geoffrey dear 
suspended two detectives and reassigned 53 members of the serious 
crime squad after electrostatic deposition tests indicated that 
records had been falsified in cases going back to 1986 
the appeal by the guildford and woolwich defendants also hinged 
on questions about police documentation prosecutors admitted that 
officers had lied about the timing of a statement by one of the 
defendants 
supporters of the birmingham six argue that their confessions 
contradict one another that police tampered with logs to make 
statements appear consistent that forensic evidence was flawed and 
that there was no witness who testified to seeing any of the men in 
the two pubs 
their cause had been taken up by amnesty international the 
irish government and leading irish and british political and 
clerical figures

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
prime minister toshiki kaifu said today that japan 
will not transport soldiers or weapons to aid the international 
force in the persian gulf but he pledged money medical personnel 
and nonmilitary supplies 
japans assistance package unveiled in a nationally televised 
speech appeared to fall short of the aid level sought by the 
united states which has deployed tens of thousands of troops to 
saudi arabia since the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
although japan quickly joined the trade embargo against iraq 
further response was slowed by debate over what action was 
permissible under japans postworld war ii constitution which 
bars the use of force in settling international disputes 
under the plan kaifu said japan will use civilian airplanes and 
ships to transport food water and medical supplies to the gulf 
japan also promised to send about 100 medical personnel 
turkey egypt and jordan were singled out for substantial 
economic assistance according to a copy of the package tens of 
thousands of foreigners fleeing kuwait and iraq have made their way 
to jordan 
the only specific amount mentioned was 10 million to aid 
refugees who have fled to jordan the package did not give a 
timetable for the aid 
the package did not include increased funding for us troops in 
japan 
there was no immediate reaction from the us embassy in tokyo 
on the annoucement 
but us officials have indicated president bush is hoping 
allies such as japan will help share the cost of the military 
buildup in the gulf 
in comments to japanese reporters tuesday night us ambassador 
to japan michael h armacost urged tokyo to help transport soldiers 
and weapons said the nihon keizai shimbun the countrys leading 
economic newspaper 
earlier today chief cabinet secretary misoji sakamoto said 
there was no link between the aid package and about 440 japanese 
being detained in iraq 
he told a news conference that holding the captives was a 
sheer violation of international law 
iraq and kuwait together supplied japan with about 11 percent of 
its oil in the first quarter of 1990 japan which imports 
virtually all its oil relies on the middle east for about 70 
percent of its needs

rescue workers alternated between 
exhilaration at finding the living beneath beams and shattered 
glass and despair over holding dead children in their arms as they 
dug through the rubble left by tornadoes 
it will be many nights before i have a good nights sleep 
again said will county executive charles adelman who helped 
comb a cornfield next to the crest hill lake apartment complex

charge of the rescue effort at the site 
at least 150 volunteer rescue workers rushed to the site 
including officers from more than 30 area police and fire 
departments said plainfield police chief don bennett 
rescuers went from apartment to apartment throwing rubble off 
of the threestory buildings with shovels or just their hands 
workers searched each building twice sifting through debris 
until well after dark

sales of new homes fell 23 percent in july 
giving up half of their gain the previous month the government 
said today in a report showing continuing weakness in the housing 
industry 
the commerce department said new home sales totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 548000 after advancing a revised 47 
percent in june the department originally reported june sales up 8 
percent 
the continuing weakness was further illustrated by the 
departments downward revision in the may sales figure as well 
last months reported 23 percent gain was reduced to just 06 
percent today 
until may new home sales had declined for five straight months 
for the first seven months of the year they have fallen 124 
percent below the pace of 1989 
the department also said inventories of new homes showed a 
78month backlog at the july sales pace it had been 77 months in 
june 
analysts have attributed the weakness in the industry to high 
interest rates consumer caution because of adverse economic news 
and a glutted market 
the national association of realtors reported on monday that 
sales of existing homes which represent about 80 percent of the 
housing market rose 33 percent in july after advancing 09 
percent in june 
but the june advance had been the first in seven months and 
analysts predicted more declines because of rising mortgage rates 
resulting from the mideast crisis 
after peaking at 1067 percent in march fixedrate 30year 
mortgages fell to 998 percent by the end of july according to the 
federal home loan mortgage corp but by last friday rates had 
moved up to 1029 percent 
commerce said the median price of a new home fell 47 percent in 
july to 121000 the median price means half of the homes cost 
more and half less the median price of an existing home that month 
was 98400 according to the realtors 
sales in the northeast which have been sluggish for more than a 
year fell 101 percent to an annual rate of 80000 units the 
department also revised the june increase downward from 369 
percent to 253 percent 
sales also fell in the west down 49 percent to 135000 units 
while they were unchanged at 237000 units in the south 
sales rose 21 percent to 96000 units in the midwest

the government today expelled two iraqi 
officials in retaliation for iraqs decision to close moroccos 
embassy in kuwait move its diplomats to baghdad and hold them as 
hostages 
moroccos action came two days after the united states ordered 
the expulsion of 36 iraqi diplomats in washington and limited the 
travel of the 19 allowed to remain 
deputy foreign minister ahmed cherkaoui told the iraqi embassy 
in rabat that the two officials of iraqs ruling baath political 
party were no longer welcome in this north african country the 
official map news agency reported 
the iraqis are issa salmane hamid and hicham hassan ahmed both 
attached to the iraqi embassy and responsible for the baath partys 
african affairs desk 
cherkaoui expressed the governments profound displeasure 
over the treatment of moroccos diplomats in kuwait map reported 
on tuesday morocco said diplomats at its embassy in kuwait were 
physically forced to leave their mission taken to baghdad and 
detained the foreign ministry said it considered the diplomats 
hostages 
iraq last week ordered all embassies in kuwait to shut down 
saying the emirate which it overran on aug 2 is now part of 
iraq many foreign governments including the united states have 
defied the shutdown order saying that would be a step toward 
recognizing the annexation of kuwait 
along with egypt morocco has spoken out strongly against the 
conquest of kuwait and has sent ground forces to saudi arabia as 
part of the multinational military effort to deter further iraqi 
aggression

fortyseven women and 
children from the us embassy in kuwait are back in the united 
states their joy at a safe homecoming mixed with anxiety for sons 
husbands and fathers held hostage in baghdad 
god bless america one of the embassy wives said as the 20 
women and 27 children stepped down from a chartered jet on tuesday 
many of the children clutched stuffed bears 
luz marina colwell wife of the us consul in kuwait william 
colwell choked back tears on the tarmac at andrews air force base 
near washington as she told how the group stuck together on its 
desert odyssey 
during the present crisis we learned to know each other to 
care for each other and we became a big family she said 
but our hearts are left in kuwait and baghdad iraq with all 
our husbands members of our families our private american 
citizens and members of the international community left behind 
said ms colwell the only member of the group to speak to 
reporters on hand for the planes arrival 
we had to keep being strong and keep our hearts very high god 
bless america she said 
the weary group boarded buses bound for a local hotel 
earlier tuesday the state department said iraqi authorities had 
taken nine more americans into custody 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said six americans were 
arrested in iraq and three in kuwait since monday bringing the 
total to 70 48 in iraq and 22 in kuwait 
iraq told the us embassy in baghdad that a 56yearold 
american man died of a heart attack in the port city of basra 
iraqi officials also told the embassy they plan to expel an 
unspecified number of american diplomats in response to the state 
department decision to order 36 iraqi embassy staff members out of 
the united states by thursday 
the us action was prompted by an iraqi demand that the united 
states and other countries close their embassies in kuwait 
the dead american who was not immediately identified was in 
iraqi custody at the time he died ms tutwiler said iraqi 
officials have agreed to conduct an autopsy and us officials 
wanted a physician chosen by the embassy to be present 
the death underscores the barbaric nature of iraqi policy 
towards foreign nationals in iraq and kuwait and makes a lie of 
iraqs claim that they are all well treated and in no danger the 
spokeswoman said 
tuesdays arrival at andrews ended a frightening voyage that 
began last week in kuwait when most of the embassys staff and 
dependents drove to baghdad ambassador nathaniel howell and a 
skeleton staff remained behind in the face of president saddam 
husseins order that all foreign missions in kuwait be closed 
baghdad was to be just a point of transit for the group but 
iraqi authorities ordered all the men to stay behind women and 
children were allowed to drive in a 13car convey to turkey where 
they arrived late sunday after a 20hour crossing of desert and 
mountains 
at the border three sons of us diplomats were turned back by 
iraqi officials because they were over 18 
five of the 52 who arrived at the border did not make the flight 
to washington a state department official said the five dropped 
off en route and went to other destinations presumably in europe 
the washington post today quoted an attendant on the flight from 
paris alex kreth as saying the passengers cried when they left on 
the final flight home cheered when they were told they had crossed 
into us airspace and hugged each other when the plane landed 
the post said one woman who returned from kuwait had brought 
home a 7monthold girl but had to leave her husband behind her 
sisterinlaw was quoted as saying you have mixed feelings 
youre happy to have her back but sad that she left her husband 
the family did not give its name 
for the second day in a row ms tutwiler said the state 
department had received reports of more americans fleeing iraq and 
kuwait 
two weeks ago the department estimated that there were 2500 
americans in kuwait and 500 in iraq who were not free to leave 
those numbers are out of date but the department has refused to 
provide new figures or say how many have escaped

plo chief yasser arafat today proposed that us 
and other foreign forces withdraw from the persian gulf region and 
be replaced by a multinational force under the un flag 
arafat one of the few arab leaders to support iraq after its 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait also accused the united states of using 
the gulf crisis to further american and israeli interests 
the statement was delivered the speech on arafats behalf at a 
unsponsored meeting of human rights groups on palestine 
the palestine liberation organization leader said the un force 
would be an interim measure until a political solution could be 
reached 
arafat urged an end to international sanctions against iraq 
however in a clear reference to israel the statement called for 
sanctions against any state that refuses to withdraw from the 
territories that it occupies 
nabil ramlawi the plos ambassador in geneva said this did not 
apply to iraq because it was assumed that an arab solution to the 
gulf conflict would make sanctions unneccessary 
ramlawi told the associated press the statement represented the 
plos latest position on the gulf crisis 
the statement said the plo was acting as a mediator in the 
conflict and did not side with one party against another 
arafats public stance against western intervention in the gulf 
and friendship with iraqi president saddam hussein has prompted 
widespread criticism of the plo in the west and among arab allies 
of saudi arabia and kuwait 
the plo is concerned that the crisis has diverted attention away 
from the palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied territories 
in his statement arafat accused the united states of acting 
to bend the united nations and international will to serve its own 
national interests as a superpower and the interests of its ally 
israel 
washington suspended an 18monthold dialogue with the plo in 
june after arafat failed to condemn a raid on an israeli beach by a 
palestinian extremist group 
the un security council has denounced iraqs invasion 
declared an embargo on iraq and backed a usled blockade

scores of police took up the hunt in 
this terrified college town today for the maniac on the loose 
who killed five students mutilating three students armed 
themselves or fled to their parents 
we slept with steak knives last night said a tearful stacie 
green a 19yearold junior from jacksonville i had to call my 
mom this is unreal 
the victims four women and a man attending either the 
university of florida or santa fe community college were stabbed 
in three attacks at offcampus apartments since sunday police said 
three victims were mutilated a newspaper said one was decapitated 
the killer used an open door open window or slidingglass door 
to enter the victims apartments which are within about two miles 
of each other police chief wayland clifton said today 
at first that was not real clear in our cases because we 
thought he might be gaining entry by disguising himself in some way 
and winning the confidence of the occupants he said we do not 
now think that that happened in any of the three cases 
the fbi has prepared a psychological profile of the killer but 
authorities do not plan to make it public clifton said 
police checked out several reports of suspicious people around 
the city overnight but made no arrests alachua county sheriffs 
lt sadie darnell said this morning 
its clear this part of the country has some maniac on the 
loose said university of florida president john lombardi it 
reminds us of a natural catastrophe the killer is selecting 
victims by criteria that are not clear to us 
gov bob martinez ordered in dozens of state troopers and other 
law enforcement agents outofstate experts on serial killers were 
called in local police tripled their patrols 
youll see more police coverage than youve ever seen in any 
city youve ever lived in clifton said 
the buildup was scant comfort for the thousands of students 
living off campus in the town of 90000 where the slayings have 
stirred memories of serial killer ted bundy he died in the 
electric chair last year after murdering two florida state 
university sorority sisters in tallahassee in a 1978 rampage 
hundreds of students bolted their doors fled to emergency 
shelters went home to their parents or angrily demanded details on 
the slayings and how to protect themselves many armed themselves 
with pistols stun guns and mace 
my father bought me a gun said a junior from tallahassee 
who refused to give her name ill stay for awhile but im 
thinking of dropping out for a semester 
said one miami father who flew into gainesville to pick up his 
daughter shes going to go back with mace and knowing how to 
shoot a gun 
student mark andreozzi said he and a roommate armed themselves 
when a carpet cleaner turned up unexpectedly tuesday i had an ax 
and he had a bat were going to get guns after this andreozzi 
said 
the university offered lodging for students afraid to return to 
offcampus apartments fraternity and sorority houses churches and 
community groups and faculty members also offered to put students 
up 
lombardi said the university decided against canceling class 
because students who couldnt go home would be left without the 
safety and support of the university but he said all penalties 
for nonattendance would be suspended 
parents and friends flooded the phone lines with anxious calls 
and students confronted the police chief with questions about how 
the killer got in 
at least tell us that so we can know what we should do said 
karyn james one of more than 1200 students who jammed the student 
union to hear the chief school president and others explain what 
precautions to take here we are buying all kinds of locks and 
deadbolts and we dont even know whether we should 
two bodies were found in one apartment on sunday one was 
discovered monday and two were found together tuesday the 
gainesville sun citing unidentified sources said one woman was 
decapitated but authorities would not confirm that 
slain were tracy inez paules 23 and a 23yearold rommmate 
manuel r taboada taboada had been a student at nearby santa fe 
community college and was planning to study at the university of 
florida ms paules was a senior at the university 
also slain were university of florida freshmen christina powell 
17 of jacksonville and sonja larson 18 of deerfield beach and 
18yearold christa hoyt a santa fe community college student and 
records clerk at the sheriffs office

the register of orange county calif on a gulf crisis federal 
surtax 
weve seen this before in 1968 lyndon johnson imposed a 
10percent surtax on incomes to pay for the vietnam war and his 
great society domestic welfare boondoggles the result the end of 
the prosperity sparked by president kennedys 1963 tax cuts and a 
decade of stagflation 
in the same way president bush if he joins the surtax mania 
would risk giving us renewed stagflation perhaps leading to his 
own defeat at the polls in 1992 but the president could by 
himself act to retard or even prevent an economic implosion 
first the president could announce that tax hikes are simply 
beyond consideration 
he could declare a moratorium on all new regulation such as the 
economykilling clean air act he could order all cabinet 
departments to reduce by 10 percent paperwork foisted on the 
public he could order a hiring freeze for all federal agencies 
to last until the end of his term of office in january 1993 
such actions to reduce the federal bureaucracy would send an 
important message when the economy gets in bad shape and familes 
must tighten their belts while businesses cut back government 
too should institute economy measures and pare down the 
president as the main molder of policy and opinion should take 
action to make sure government does its part to lighten the added 
burden now carried by all americans

for george bush and the us armed forces he is massing there 
saudi arabia normally a sandy locale suddenly has turned into a 
forbidding place of rocks and hard places 
some pleasant and some nasty surprises have turned up praise 
allah troops from morocco egypt and syria are standing with us in 
the desert against the fellow arab who aspires to conquer and lead 
them all 
on the down side soviet military advisers reportedly are still 
giving saddam husseins divisions the guidance and technical 
support that helped them defeat the iranians so much for 
ussoviet solidarity in opposing husseins aggression 
hussein knows that if he can knock out the saudi oil fields the 
loss of that oil together with the trade embargo on iraq and 
kuwait could drive the industrial world into a deep recession so 
does the hardline soviet general said to be advising hussein 
for arab and western nations alike hussein threatens more than 
the gulfs oil supplies so if there is ever to be peace in the 
region saddam must go and there is no easy painless way to 
dispatch him but before us military power is unleashed bush 
should try to squeeze hussein harder by getting soviet advisers 
out of iraq and more arab troops in saudi arabia

the flint mich journal on the persian gulf 
we didnt buy it did you 
we hope most people around the globe who saw videotape of the 
friendly butcher of baghdads disgusting manipulation of 
innocent children and others hes holding hostage werent fooled 
we hope they responded with revulsion and an increased 
determination to rid the world of saddam husseins imperialistic 
terror 
this unscrupulous kidnapper and killer who has unleashed the 
horrors of chemical weapons upon young and old who condemned a 
million people to death in the war with iran that he initiated who 
shamelessly raped and robbed kuwait who declared a holy war 
against the united states and who is now shielding iraq against an 
angry worlds response by holding innocent people as prisoners at 
military installations has miscalculated once again if he thinks 
intelligent and sensitive human beings believe he loves children or 
has any respect for life 
using his governmentcontrolled media as propaganda weapons he 
hopes to paralyze the west especially britain and the united 
states from responding decisively 
he is trying to terrorize us and make us feel guilty well we 
will not be made to tremble and we have nothing to feel guilty 
about harm inflicted upon saddams thousands of guests being 
held against their will at gunpoint will be on his head he and his 
army will be held accountable 
the little british lad whose head saddam and his military goons 
caressed didnt buy the lying leaders ugly display of insincerity 
and neither we hope did the rest of the world just as the 
civilized world didnt buy images of a smiling josef stalin patting 
the head of a peasant girl while sending her parents to the gulag 
or of an affable adolf hitler strolling along flowerstrewn paths 
while trying to bring the world to its knees 
in our view saddams sickening stunt has only served to 
strengthen our resolve that he must be stopped and that his machine 
of war and destruction must be dismantled

mohawk negotiators met with government officials 
today in an effort to end a standoff between troops and indians 
after the army announced it was bringing in hundreds more soldiers 
to dismantle barricades 
quebec native affairs minister john ciaccia said the talks were 
under way at the request of the mohawks and that he had briefed 
quebec premier robert bourassa tuesday night 
ciaccia said he wasnt calling the talks to end the 7weekold 
standoff formal negotiations and the armys intention to 
dismantle the barricades had not changed 
negotiators declined to comment as they entered a hotel room in 
dorval 
canadian fighter jets on tuesday swooped over the oka area near 
montreal where heavily armed mohawks have dug in at a road 
barricade in a dispute over a planned golf course addition that 
they say would encroach on ancestral soil 
about a dozen miles away just south of montreal mohawks backing 
the oka protest have barricaded a commuter bridge in sympathy 
the mercier bridge blockade has angered many people who use the 
bridge to commute to montreal and about 500 people stoned mohawk 
families leaving the adjacent kahnawake reservation on tuesday 
some injuries were reported 
brig gen armand roy tactical commander of the soldiers moving 
in on the two sets of barricades told a news conference late 
tuesday that military operations will cease only when the armed 
warriors lay down their weapons and surrender without conditions 
roy added that he has ordered his soldiers to move closer to 
indian positions in preparation for a move to dismantle the mohawk 
barricades at the kahnawake and oka reservations 
oka is 18 miles west of montreal the kahawake reservation lies 
between the mercier bridge and suburban towns that depend on the 
bridge to cross the st lawrence river to get to montreal 
early today the army announced that 675 more men 136 wheeled 
vehicles and 50 tracked vehicles would be deployed to the outskirts 
of the kahnawake reservation before tuesday about 2500 combat 
soldiers were positioned outside both reservations 
the number of indian fighters is believed to be in the hundreds 
the army says mohawks at the barricades have at least 170 automatic 
weapons and an intricate network of trenches bunkers and strong 
points 
lt gen kent foster said tuesday that soldiers would use three 
unarmed 42ton leopard tanks equipped with a bulldozer front to 
remove the barriers he would not say when dismantling would begin 
prime minister brian mulroney blamed mohawk negotiators for the 
crisis 
he went on national tv on tuesday and challenged mohawks to take 
down the barricades themselves before the army does he said the 
federal and quebec governments had dealt with the land dispute in 
good faith but mohawk bargainers advanced unrealistic 
conditions and then demanded acceptance 
we cannot overlook the illegal activities of an extremist 
minority mulroney said referring to the mohawks warrior 
contingent 
mohawk negotiator billy two rivers said one more day of talks 
should break the impasse and open mercier bridge and the roads 
leading to it 
we are in a process of achieving through negotiation what the 
army was mandated to do by force he said after tuesdays 
session were positive that in the next 24 hours things can be 
resolved 
but mulroney said he consulted quebec authorities and that a 
settlement doesnt appear to be within reach 
foster said there were plans to evacuate people from military 
zones if necessary and that those that live in surrounding areas 
will be told to stay in their basements 
many local residents have complained bitterly about the 
barricading of the mercier bridge which has led to lengthy 
commuting detours and meant lost business 
hundreds of people hurled rocks and construction material at a 
convoy of 60 or more cars carrying mohawk families out of kahnawake 
reservation by the bridge on tuesday 
police said there were some injuries but that no one appeared 
badly hurt 
the armed confrontation in oka began after a quebec policeman 
was killed on july 11 when police tried to tear down a mohawk 
barricade at the reservation and a gun battle erupted blame in the 
death has not been fixed 
on monday bourassa said he was through with talks and was 
asking the army to remove the barricades

the registerguard eugene ore on natural resources 
new evidence that a substance extracted from yew trees can be 
used as an effective treatment for certain types of cancer 
transforms a lowgrade natural resource into a potentially 
important one it also teaches important lessons todays weed tree 
may be tomorrows miracle and what once was wasted may soon be 
developed as a valuable resource 
the pacific yew grows in small quantities over a broad range in 
the northwest its uses are ancient but limited the longbows that 
defended england against viking raids were made of yew but it has 
never been a major commercial species today yew wood is still 
used for bows as well as canoe paddles fence posts and decorative 
veneers the market is so limited however that loggers usually 
ignore yew in favor of douglas fir hemlock and other trees better 
suited as saw timber 
that may change with the discovery that taxol a compound found 
in the bark and other parts of trees of the yew or taxus genus 
holds promise as a treatment for ovarian cancer ovarian cancer 
kills 12400 women a year in the united states efforts to 
synthesize taxol have so far been unsuccessful 
the potential emergence of what one dendrology book describes as 
a small bushy untidy tree as a treatment against a common type of 
cancer underscores the fact that there are no unimportant species 
judging a tree or a bird or a flower to be of no significance says 
more about the limits of human understanding than about the species 
in question every form of life has value of some kind but the 
true worth of many has yet to be discovered

the oshkosh wis northwestern on bgh 
if bovine growth hormone bgh were eventually proven to be able 
to grow hair on a billiard ball remove warts without surgery and 
suppress the common cold it would still have its detractors crying 
that thats not enough 
the food and drug administration has declared that bgh increases 
milk production in cows with no health risk to consumers 
but we need more study cry the critics what about 10 
years from now 
ten years from now of course the critics will still be asking 
for more study thats the easy way of scuttling anything new 
studies by the fda and by american medical association 
researchers have been reassuring that the hormone poses no risks 
some critics take a different tack to be sure some cite the 
economic and sociologic aspects of introducing bgh into the dairy 
industry 
but that is an absolute dead issue if the hormone is safe it is 
just as logical to argue that the combine doomed the family farm 
concept as it is to blame bgh 
milk producers use every possible strategy to boost milk 
production with improved feeds and breeding programs bgh is just 
another tool in that quest for more production for less cost 
the evidence of science mounts that the hormone can benefit 
mankind in much the same way but more dramatically than better 
bovine nutrition

new york hilton forced the evacuation of 1000 people from the 
45story hotel no injuries were reported

the fire which was contained in an electrical switching room 
knocked out the 2000room hotels power 
firefighters ushered people out of the lobby warning them 
through bullhorns do not breathe the smoke 
thousands of conventiongoers were caught in the smoke including 
kathleen booth of norwalk conn who said the fumes were really 
intense 
hughes and con edison electric company spokeswoman pat richardi 
said the fire did not affect any transformers so there was no 
danger from burned pcbs polychlorinated biphenyls used as 
insulation in electrical equipment cause toxic smoke when they 
burn 
con ed shut off the power and the hotel resorted to emergency 
power full power was to remain off until sometime in the afternoon

het parool amsterdam netherlands on saddam husseins 
televised meeting with western hostages 
baffling images from baghdad with his revolting tv appearance 
in which as a wellmeaning uncle he let himself amiably be 
photographed with a powerless family of british hostages saddam 
hussein has hopefully lost the credit he still had especially in 
the arab world 
this saddam hussein is a dangerous lunatic nothing more but 
most of all nothing less and he must be driven off stage as fast 
as possible the threat emanating from his latest tv show im 
here and i do what i want is too big to allow him to carry on 
further 
precisely in this context it is promising that the five 
permanent members of the united nations security council agreed 
unexpectedly fast to a draft resolution which gives the military 
force that has already collected around iraq the right to use force 
if necessary to stop the iraqi dictator

the only hope of averting a major military collision in the 
present situation lies in president saddam hussein showing that his 
proclaimed desire for peace talks is not meant to trap the rest of 
the world into coming to terms with iraqi seizure of kuwait in any 
sense 
if however he is only looking for a facesaving device to 
restore the status quo there is no dearth of diplomatic skill to

the sunday correspondent london on the persian gulf 
the release of brian keenan after his fouryear incarceration in 
beirut would in normal times be a cause for unfettered delight 
yet in the context of the mass seizing of hostages by saddam 
hussein the matter takes on another and less happy aspect 
if our western societies are so worried about the fate of a 
single citizen how are they to cope with the fate of thousands 
will we become obsessed by saddams human shield will our human 
concern for the individuals involved paralyze our efforts to curb 
saddam 
if jimmy carter as president of the worlds largest power could 
be brought down by his failure to rescue a handful of hostages in 
iran does not george bush face certain humiliation as a result of 
the present much larger problem 
much that is happening makes such an outcome more likely 
but we have soberly to appreciate that some causes are important 
enough to be worth the sacrifice of human life 
we have to recognize that in this crisis the side that blinks 
first is lost we have to be aware that appeasement to save those 
individuals in peril could easily threaten the lives of others 
whom saddam might use as pawns in future

business times kuala lumpur malaysia on the persian gulf 
whatever the outcome of the peace process and even if the status 
quo before aug 2 is restored that is the complete withdrawal of 
iraqi forces from kuwait and the restoration of the alsabah family 
the scenario in the gulf area will never be the same again 
the crisis will be the watershed marking the beginning of the 
end of the old order in the area 
just as the winds of change have blown across the soviet union 
and eastern europe they have now moved down into the persian gulf 
the writing is already on the wall for the absolute monarchies 
there 
if they value their continuity the monarchies will have to meet 
the new challenges by instituting fundamental changes to bring in 
democratic processes in their administrations by allowing greater 
citizen participation 
the process for change has been simmering underground for some 
years and though president saddam hussein is nowhere near a role 
model for democratic participation his actions will nevertheless 
act as a catalyst for the transformation of the old order in the 
gulf 
the mere presence of us forces which include women and jews in 
such a closed society as saudi arabia will definitely have 
repercussions on saudi society and put further pressures for 
modernization 
for the us and the western powers they will also have to come 
to terms with legitimate arab demands visavis the question of 
arab interest which definitely also includes the interest for the 
palestinians who are no less arabs than the saudis or the kuwaitis

western straits times singapore on developments in burma 
burmas rulers are still trying to reconcile the irreconcilable 
they want the outside worlds approval expressed in aid and 
investments but are unwilling to take the steps the world demands 
as a precondition for loosening its purse strings 
trade has been liberalized since 1985 and in the past few years 
especially foreign businessmen and potential investors have been 
actively courted but the colonels and generals who rule burma seem 
intent on ensuring that their version of glasnost and perestroika 
is confined strictly to a narrowlydefined economic sphere 
three months after holding free elections the first in 30 
years the military is refusing to hand over power to the civilians 
who won 80 percent of the available seats worse it is not even 
saying when it might do so the population having overwhelmingly 
rejected military rule is not surprisingly resentful and there 
have been reports of scattered demonstrations in several cities 
like most of its factories and vehicles which date to the 
1950s if not earlier the economy is slowly but inexorably falling 
apart the rulers have to make a choice they either accept the 
verdict of the people and the need for real change or find 
themselves presiding over a ruin not a country with a onceproud 
history

prosecutors filed seven perjury charges against 
police chief mack vines reportedly for statements he made to a 
panel investigating a police officers fatal shooting of an unarmed 
mexican national 
dallas county district attorney john vance today announced the 
charges and said they will be reviewed by a grand jury next week 
they are thirddegree felonies each carrying a maximum 10year 
prison term and fines of up to 10000 
this office intends to seek indictments and prosecute any 
person who has committed crimes involving acts of official public 
corruption regardless of who it may be vance said in a 
statement 
vance said details of vines statements will be made available 
upon the returning of indictments 
vines attorney kim wade is not speaking with the media a 
woman who answered the phone at wades office said this morning 
the charges stem from vines testimony before a panel reviewing 
the 1989 dismissal of officer patrick lemaire 
the panel had confronted the chief with accusations that he 
tried to influence the testimony of an assistant chief regarding 
the speed of the internal investigation of lemaire 
vines fired lemaire 17 days after he killed jose hilario an 
unarmed mexican national on june 27 1989 the chief said lemaire 
violated the departments policy by failing to take steps that 
would have avoided a confrontation 
vines first said no when asked whether he had talked to 
anyone about the panels investigation but changed his answer upon 
further questioning according to sources familiar with the 
transcript of the hearing the dallas morning news reported 
the chief then acknowledged that he talked to assistant chief 
greg holliday before holliday testified vines has denied trying to 
influence him 
both vines and holliday have been on indefinite leave with pay 
for about three weeks 
saying she was speaking on behalf of her husband the chiefs 
wife said tuesday night he had no comment when asked about stories 
in the news and the dallas times herald that vines case would go 
to a grand jury 
an administrative law judge ruled last month that lemaire should 
be reinstated saying the city failed to justify his dismissal 
an internal affairs detective testified during the 
administrative hearing that his initial report on the shooting was 
later altered 
ms hart appointed a special panel to review the allegations 
the panel found no wrongdoing in the lemaire case by vines and his 
staff saying that the altered report was the result of poor 
procedures in the internal affairs division 
but the panel brought up allegations of perjury and witness 
tampering that prompted ms hart to place vines and holliday on 
indefinite paid leave 
sources say no charges will be filed against holliday the news 
reported

the us militarys first strike will be 
against remote air bases missile sites and chemical weapons 
installations if the persian gulf standoff turns into a shooting 
war experts on the middle east and national security say 
an attack on the presidential palace in crowded baghdad is also 
seen as a possibility 
american officials in saudi arabia say an allout assault on 
iraq is highly unlikely unless the iraqis fire first they have 
discussed contingency plans but pentagon ground rules forbids 
disclosure of specific targets 
experts here also were reluctant to pinpoint exact locations 
they thought might be targeted but indicated the initial focus 
would be on iraqs air force and missiles 
to destroy the iraqi air force on the ground will be the no 1 
priority and to prevent them from firing missiles said barry 
rubin senior fellow at the washington institute for near east 
policy a private research group 
other targets rubin predicted would be supply depots and 
supply lines and places that produce chemical weapons 
asked to be specific he said i dont think it would be 
useful to go into that but we know where the chemical 
installations are and satellites take very nice pictures 
william b quandt a national security council official in the 
nixon and carter administrations who is a senior fellow with the 
brookings institution listed much the same priorities 
i think their first concern would be to neutralize 
surfacetosurface missile capability and then to establish air 
superiority without any question quandt said 
he said military officials would be likely also to pinpoint 
anything they know about chemical depots not so much the plants 
but where they store the stuff 
and then there is the kind of notion that we ought to sneak in 
and drop a bomb on the presidential palace on top of it all 
quandt said i am sure somebody is thinking about hitting the 
socalled command and control centers 
such an attack would strike at the heart of baghdad a city of 
more than 3 million people 
i am not sure you could take anything without taking out 
civilian populations not around baghdad thats for sure said 
joyce r starr a washington consultant and expert on middle east 
conflict who served in the carter white house 
i think if they really decide to go for broke there will be 
civilian casualties quandt said 
rubin said the military installations unlike the presidential 
palace and other government buildings are remote from population 
centers 
they are not necessarily in the desert but they are not in 
the middle of cities either he said 
according to a forthcoming book by leonard s spector and 
jacqueline r smith of the carnegie endowment for international 
peace iraq has been conducting work on uranium enrichment a key 
process in making fuel for nuclear weapons at a plant near baghdad 
the book concludes that iraq has apparently launched a nuclear 
weapons program but will not be able to build such arms on its own 
until late in this decade 
rubin said the nuclear plant would not be an important target 
because for the short run iraq has no nuclear capability 
after the air force and the missile sites he said the 
principal aim would have to be at the warmaking capacity not at 
civilians or even at the industrial capacity 
the state department has said it had credible reports that iraq 
was moving foreigners trapped within its borders to industrial 
sites that might be targets of attack 
quandt said he assumed the us military would take that into 
account up to a point but i think once they have decided 
something is really a high priority target they will go after it 
with or without the presence of american civilians

a solar collector has produced a tiny beam of 
sunlight that outshines the sun its 15 percent brighter than the 
glow at the suns surface 
in a brief note in thursdays journal nature dave cooke and 
colleagues at the university of chicago said they used a sapphire 
light funnel to produce sunlight 84000 times as bright as the 
sunlight striking the earth 
the researchers having beaten the sun at its own game boasted 
that they had done more than set a world record they produced the 
highest concentration of sunlight in the solar system 
two years ago the group reported that it had produced sunlight 
56000 times as concentrated as sunlight at the earths surface 
the concentrator uses a parabolic mirror like those used in 
reflecting telescopes and a nonimaging concentrator made of 
sapphire the mirror reflects light to the broad end of the 
coneshaped concentrator which acts like a funnel the researchers 
said 
light is directed inside the concentrator to emerge in 
concentrated form at the tip of the cone the researchers said 
the bright beam of concentrated sunlight emerged from a 
1millimeter aperture at the tip of the concentrator one 
millimeter is about onetwentyfourth of an inch 
refinements of the technique could lead to the development of a 
laser fired by

president bush today called the persian gulf 
crisis one of the toughest military missions in modern memory 
and the white house said iraq had not yet made good on its promise 
to free foreign women and children 
i have no evidence indicating that people have been 
allowed to leave white house spokesman roman popadiuk told 
reporters he said the government was ready to look into any 
means that will facilitate their departure once iraqs president 
saddam hussein fulfills his tuesday pledge to allow departure from 
iraq of foreign women and children 
iraqs ambassador to the united states mohamed almashat went 
to the state department today to notify the united states of the 
decision to let women and children go he said americans will be 
allowed to leave through jordan or turkey but gave no timetable 
for their departure 
popadiuk refused to confirm or deny a report that the 
administration had received a message from saddam hussein offering 
to pull out his invading troops from kuwait with conditions 
the spokesman said that a western physician would observe an 
autopsy of an american man who died while a hostage of iraq iraqi 
officials said he had an apparent heart attack and us officials 
have said nothing to indicate they believe otherwise 
in a situation wehre theres a war going on and people are 
being detained theres all kinds of stress and who can say what 
might happen popadiuk said 
the president this morning gave a radio pep talk broadcast over 
armed forces radio to troops in saudi arabia but most us 
soldiers in the gulf did not hear it because the radio network does 
not have a transmitter in saudi arabia 
in dhahran navy capt mike sherman said trancripts and tape 
recordings of the speech will be distributed to each unit stationed 
in saudi arabia a process which including delivery time would 
take a week 
popadiuk said the white house knew about the transmission 
problem ahead of time and anticipated the tape distribution he 
said the only ones who heard it live were troops on ships and in 
bahrain 
bush spoke by telephone this morning with japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu whose government unveiled a package of 
money medics and transportation for the multinational effort 
against iraq 
bush also spoke tuesday night to united nations secretary 
general javier perez de cuellar and wished him well in his thursday 
negotiations with iraqi officials aimed at finding a solution to 
the persian gulf crisis 
in his radio speech bush told the troops you stand on the 
front line against aggression and international lawlessness 
we have never sought conflict nor do we hope to chart a course 
for other nations but at the hands of injustice in the face of 
aggression ours is a once reluctant fist now clutched 
resolutely he said 
it is your presence your skills your talents your judgment 
that bring americas principles to life and give them strength and 
meaning bush said 
youre now in one of the toughest military missions in 
memory bush added as tough as it is know this thanks to 
you nobodys feeling the heat more than the government in 
baghdad 
the presidents pep talk came a day after he received a strong 
vote of confidence from a large bipartisan contingent of members 
of congress 
while they voiced overall support for his policy some said they 
wanted to see other wealthy nations share the cost 
the bush administration is trying to allies to help pay for it 
administration officials and lawmakers say 
members of congress briefed by bush on the persian gulf 
situation tuesday said they received indications that the united 
states was pressuring the international community to provide money 
the question of burdensharing was brought up and discussed in 
a variety of ways said rep dante fascell dfla chairman of 
the house foreign affairs committee its being carefully 
studied since it is an international effort the burden falls on 
all countries i would think that shortly here there would be 
clarification 
while bush got a message of strong support for his persian gulf 
strategy during the meeting with about 170 members of congress 
several voiced concerns about the cost and said other wealthy 
nations should shoulder some of the burden 
obviously people are concerned about the cost said rep 
david bonior dmich they want to know what the japanese and the 
germans and others are doing to share this burden 
the pentagon projected tuesday the us cost for the buildup 
will reach 25 billion by the end of september 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said bush sought 
to assure the lawmakers he did not intend to put the entire cost on 
the strapped us treasury especially with precarious 
deficitreduction talks in progress between the administration and 
congress 
the united states has about 80000 troops either in saudi arabia 
or en route 
twentytwo countries including the soviet union britain 
france and egypt have either dispatched troops and equipment or 
have promised to do so

some 1990 us coin proof sets that sell for 
11 are worth more than 100 times that because of a missing mint 
mark on a penny according to dealers 
the penny in the 3555 sets is missing the s all proof coins 
normally bear that makes them unusual and valuable to collectors 
the sets of highly polished coins were struck and issued before 
the error was discovered us mint spokeswoman hamilton dix 
confirmed tuesday 
i stuck my neck out when these things showed up and predicted 
that by the end of the decade these things will be worth 10000 
said alan herbert who broke news of the error in the aug 7 
edition of numismatic news newspaper of iola wis 
we have talked with a collector who had ordered five sets from 
the mint and all five of those sets were missing the mint mark 
said beth deischler editor of coin world newspaper in sidney ohio 
at that time he wasnt considering selling at any price 
the errors are a prize because there are so few of them 
ms deischler said 
coin dealer harry forman of suburban cheltenham paid 1400 each 
last week for four sets and is now offering 1700 per set 
the proof coins are made by using polished blanks and dies the 
flat surfaces are mirrorlike and the relief portions look frosted 
the 11 fivecoin set contains a penny nickel dime quarter and 
half dollar a sixcoin prestige set adds a proof dollar and sells 
for 46 
proof coins are struck at the san francisco mint and thus should 
bear an s under the date dies for striking the coins are made 
at the philadelphia mint the philadelphia mint puts no mark on 
pennies it strikes but they all go into general circulation 
were investigating to find out exactly what happened miss 
dix said we are taking steps to ensure this does not happen 
again 
similar errors were made on proof nickels in 1971 and proof 
dimes in 1968 1970 1975 and 1983 herbert said

a proposal to declare crack cocaine houses health 
hazards has been dropped and a regulation requiring health and 
safety plans for them has been repealed by the king county health 
board 
after nine months of grappling with the issue the panel voted 
21 tuesday to leave enforcement of cocaine and other drug laws to 
police 
board member greg nickels who also serves on the county 
council said anticrack regulations put the health department in 
this law enforcement role i believe inappropriately 
he said health inspectors lack the training experience and 
temperament to do police work 
the regulation requiring crack house health plans was proposed 
in december it was adopted jan 3 shortly before a change in 
board membership and took effect july 1 
but it never was enforced largely because of concern that it 
gave the appearance of sanctioning illegal drug operations 
prosecutors drafted extensive amendments to establish a civil 
process for declaring premises where crack cocaine is made sold or 
used to be health hazards the declaration made owners and 
operators subject to heavy fines closure and potential loss of the 
property 
assuming adequate police drug enforcement efforts the health 
hazard plan would give us two stones at one bird said deputy 
prosecutor john cobb 
i think the board felt at the time we should use whatever 
tools we have to fight crack houses hill said 
the regulation drew fire from civil rights advocates and 
advocates for lowincome renters and the homeless at a july 24 
hearing 
opponents noted that health inspectors could enter a dwelling or 
apartment house without a search warrant and if they found drugs 
the landlord could evict everyone including lawabiding occupants 
who might lack access to other housing 
authorities said they never expected to get health and safety 
plans but hefty fines for failure to file the plans would be a 
means to attack crack houses 
landlords tenants and others found responsible could have faced 
fines as high as 1000 for each day a crack house remained in 
operation 
the proposals would not have affected seattle where police have 
relied on a state law allowing civil abatement proceedings to close 
and condemn crack houses after owners fail to end drug operations

president saddam hussein of iraq is 
expected to declare federated selfrule for kuwait in a bid to ease 
the gulf crisis and the united states to withdraw in partial 
victory senior arab military officials said wednesday 
the idea already floated to the soviet union and the united 
states the sources said may figure in talks thursday between 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz and un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar in amman 
the officials who spoke on the understanding that neither they 
nor their countries be identified said saddam was likely to 
announce the move before the end of september 
under a plan being considered they said kuwait might have 
autonomy perhaps with a bloc of parliament seats and positions in 
the iraqi national cabinet saddam would accept a timetable and 
conditions to protect us interests in the persian gulf the 
sources said 
such a plan would have little appeal to the kuwaiti government 
now in exile in saudi arabia saddams centralized government is 
not likely to allow much political or economic leeway 
according to the officials analysis neither saddam nor 
president bush can withdraw from the lines they have drawn in the 
desert sand both are buying time until some flexibility can be 
found 
iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 six days later saddam annexed 
kuwait despite universal condemnation and an american military 
buildup in saudi arabia on aug 28 he declared kuwait as iraqs 
19th province 
the officials said iraq was still working on the details of its 
federation plan which presumably would provide a different 
statute for kuwait 
the idea was passed to soviet officials who in turn relayed it 
to washington the arab sources said perez de cuellar is expected 
to sound out aziz and report to washington 
iraqs move will take some time one official said but 
there should be a surprise from baghdad in three to four weeks 
bush has repeatedly rejected out of hand any solution but the 
withdrawal of iraqi forces and restoration of the kuwaiti 
government us officials have made no public acknowledgement of 
flexibility 
but the arab sources said that privately the americans are 
looking for some compromise which would make their point assure 
stability in the gulf oilfields and allow an honorable 
disengagement 
the americans must bear in mind that iraq will never let go of 
kuwait one official said 
if no solution could be negotiated the others agreed kuwait 
would have to be retaken by force 
the officials considered the next three weeks to be crucial to 
washington us forces can wait until late september when desert 
temperatures cool when more units and heavy weapons particularly 
tanks arrive and when troops are acclimatized to the terrain 
but after that saddams message of arab unity along with his 
linking of kuwait to the israelioccupied territories will bolster 
his support in the arab world facing off a superpower would 
impress the undecided in the arab world 
saddams strategy appears to be that the longer he can be seen 
to be defying singlehandedly the united states military might 
the more he will be viewed as the champion of the arabs 
diplomatic sources and intelligence officials in amman wednesday 
reported that prosaddam demonstrations had even erupted in syria 
iraqs longtime arab rival 
the senior military officials agreed that if bush does not 
strike by the end of september his administration will be seen to 
have failed in a dramatic attempt to rescue kuwait 
they felt that bush is reluctant to test iraqs ability to 
counterattack 
all diplomatic moves are pushing this way one senior source 
said all parties have the conviction that they should not 
escalate tension in the gulf while they explore for a peaceful 
solution 
iraq offered a form of autonomy to the kurdish territory of 
northern iraq in 1970 if the kurdish experience is any model 
federation within iraq would require difficult bargaining the 
officials acknowledged iraqs 35 million kurds have bitterly 
resisted rule from baghdad for decades 
the kurds accepted autonomy with some parliament seats and 
positions in the national cabinet but two years later the kurds 
accused baghdad of reneging and fighting broke out again 
saddam then vice president and strongman of the regime offered 
only limited autonomy fullscale guerrilla warfare broke out in 
1974 it was crushed a year later when iran withdrew its support of 
the kurds in exchange for rights in the shattalarab waterway on 
the border with iraq 
in 1980 the kurds aided iran in its with iraq after the august 
1988 ceasefire saddams army killed thousands of kurds with 
poison gas

a paraplegic who fought for years to protect the 
disabled was hospitalized after a fire that authorities said was 
started on the wheelchair ramp he needed to get to his door 
james lundvall 46 was found unconscious in the front bedroom 
of his smokefilled duplex early tuesday after neighbors saw flames 
he was in critical condition at porter memorial hospital 
suffering from smoke inhalation 
fire investigators believe lundvall was a random victim of an 
arsonist who poured gasoline on the 40foot wooden wheelchair ramp 
at the back of the duplex then ignited it 
whoever set the fire kept pouring all the way down the ramp 
they doused it said fire capt gregory taft 
the back of lundvalls home caught fire and smoke spread quickly 
because interior doors had been removed to allow lundvall to move 
through the house in his electric wheelchair 
it doesnt appear he ever woke up said taft 
taft said a car was set afire about six blocks away earlier in 
the morning and investigators were checking for possible links 
lundvall was disabled by an auto accident when he was a 
teenager he has only limited use of his arms cannot speak and 
communicates with a word board 
his girlfriend debbie tracy was killed several weeks ago when 
her wheelchair was struck by a car 
lundvall has been a champion for the rights of the disabled 
participating in a lawsuit to win the right to live independently 
and in demonstrations across the country to gain handicapped access 
to transportation and other services 
hes been a fighter said wade blank a longtime friend and 
codirector of the atlantis community an advocacy group for the 
disabled 
blank recalled that lundvall pulled his wheelchair in front of a 
bus during a 1978 demonstration in denver and crawled up the steps 
of the nations capital earlier this year to support the rights of 
the disabled 
lundvall was bothered by youths who stole his television set 
about a year ago but had no recent problems with crime blank said

iraqs invasion of kuwait proves that the 
world remains a dangerous place despite the reduction of eastwest 
tensions vice president dan quayle told veterans at the american 
legion national convention today 
as the cold war comes to an end the free world may be less 
burdened with fighting communist aggression but theres a new 
evil lawlessness and terrorism quayle said 
quayle called iraq an outrageous violator of decency and 
civilized international behavior 
and it falls to america to play a critical role an 
indispensible role in upholding global standards of civility and 
decency 
quayle urged congressional support for increased military 
spending because only a strong america can help bring peace to 
the world 
quayle a former senator from indiana whose national guard 
service during the vietnam war became a campaign liability was 
greeted warmly by the legionnaires they interrupted his speech 
frequently with applause 
on the opening day tuesday of the weeklong 72nd american legion 
convention participants said the gis sent to the persian gulf are 
better trained and equipped than ever and have greater public 
support than at any time since world war ii 
weve got the world on our side as well as the american 
public said john brieden a 40yearold vietnamera veteran from 
brenham texas 
brieden said the issues surrounding the persian gulf crisis are 
better understood than those of vietnam as a result of that 
they are supporting the current position he said 
during world war ii everyone was behind the gi more than in 
korea or vietnam said dick carrignan 72 of fitchburg mass a 
paratrooper in france and germany during world war ii people can 
see why were going there just the same as in world war ii 
willie m mclaughlin a 63yearold korean war veteran from 
greenwood sc said troops today are professional soldiers with 
at least a high school education while in korea many draftees were 
in boot camp just a few weeks before seeing action 
they are more mobile now they can get into action much 
quicker said george cornish a 61yearold korean war veteran 
from canandaigua ny 
several vets drew an analogy between the current deployment and 
world war ii arguing that in both cases an aggressive nation had 
to be held in check 
in the beginning of world war ii there were isolationists who 
didnt want for us to get into it said former seaman richard 
ramage 65 of franklin nj now i think probably a lesson was 
learned we waited then and had to mobilize that much quicker to go 
and stop hitler 
the veterans expressed optimism that diplomacy would settle the 
conflict 
i just hope they dont jump in too fast and pull the trigger 
too soon said cornish

the governments main economic forecasting 
gauge stalled in july indicating to analysts that the nation might 
have been limping toward recession even before the middle east 
crisis 
the commerce department said wednesday that its index of leading 
economic indicators was unchanged after posting a barely 
perceptible 01 percent gain in june 
the index is designed to forecast economic conditions six months 
to nine months in the future 
essentially its another indication of a slumping economy 
said david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a new 
york securities company in all likelihood itll be down sharply 
next month reflecting the oil price shock and uncertainty caused 
by the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
gordon richards an economist with the national association of 
manufacturers said that while the july figures dont point to a 
recession the sharp rise in world oil prices has made a downturn 
almost inevitable 
three successive declines in the index have often but not 
always signaled a recession in the past however some economists 
believe the economy already is in a recession 
in a second report illustrating the weakness in the economy the 
department said new home sales in july posted their fifth decline 
in seven months down 23 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 548000 units 
new home sales so far this year are 124 percent below those of 
the first seven months of 1989 
only three of the 11 indicators in the leading index made 
positive contributions an increase in orders for new plants and 
equipment an increase in the price of raw materials and an index 
measuring consumer confidence 
analysts said the consumer confidence component which is 
compiled by the university of michigan would plummet in the august 
index 
initial reports indicate that the consumers first 
reaction to the iraqi invasion was near panic said economist 
mark m zandi of regional financial associates in west chester pa 
consumer spending represents twothirds of the nations economic 
activity and economists worry that a major cutback could halt 
economic growth altogether and push the nation into recession 
robert g dederick chief economist for the northern trust co 
in chicago noted that plant and equipment orders one of the 
positive indicators usually are a barometer of business investment 
plans 
the question now is how much of that will be held down now by 
not knowing whats going to happen and being unwilling to make 
decisions he asked 
economist richards suggested that because capital is 
energyintensive the oil price shock points to some scaling back 
of investment spending 
negative contributors were faster business delivery times a 
decline in the money supply a drop in manufacturers unfilled 
orders a shorter average work week a drop in building permits an 
increase in weekly unemployment claims and a decline in the stock 
market 
daryl delano of cahners economics in newton mass said stock 
prices had continued to decline since the iraqi invasion and 
noting lackluster home sales said building permits would remain a 
negative in the august report 
one of the july components orders for consumer goods was 
unchanged 
the various changes left the index at 1461 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 and up 14 percent from its level a year ago

sandy the stray mutt that was rescued from 
the pound and went on to star in the broadway smash annie died 
wednesday in his sleep he was 16 or 112 in dog years 
sandy a mix of airedale and irish setter originated the role 
of annies faithful dog in the goodspeed opera houses 1976 
production in connecticut he then played the entire broadway run 
from 1977 to 1983 said william berloni sandys owner and trainer 
it was berloni then an 18yearold apprentice at the goodspeed 
with no experience as an animal trainer who rescued sandy from the 
connecticut humane society the day before the animal was to be put 
to sleep 
berloni had been told to find a dog for the production after 
looking at 500 dogs he found sandy and bought him for 8 
he had been abused he was frightened of people berloni 
said so when we treated him with kindness and love and 
affection he really responded that made him easy to train 
sandy won the hearts of theatergoers as the dog that befriends 
annie after she runs away from an orphanage the two are separated 
and spend much of the musical looking for each other until they are 
reunited for a happy ending 
its interesting how one animal touched so many lives 
berloni said people liked to believe in fun things and annie and 
sandy wherever they went really brought a lot of joy to people 
sandy had to perform more than 20 stunts during the show 
including barking on a hand signal to protect annie from the police 
and walking across the stage by himself looking left and right in 
search of annie 
after the show closed sandy retired to connecticut but made 
occasional guest appearances 
sandy suffered in recent years from degenerative arthritis and 
bone spurs on his spine that brought on paralysis and general 
weakness 
working dogs when they cant do their jobs any more they 
really give up and die berloni said he decided his time was 
up

a lawyer sued the national endowment for the 
arts on wednesday alleging that its 15000 grant for an artists 
controversial exhibition displayed open and notorious hostility 
toward religion and violated the constitution 
the lawsuit was filed against the nea and its chairman john e 
frohnmayer in us district court by the rutherford institute a 
nonprofit legal services organization on behalf of david fordyce 
fordyce a lawyer was described as a devout christian from 
los angeles 
the suit cited the neas grant last year for tongues of 
flame an exhibit of works by david wojnarowicz of new york that 
was organized by university galleries at illinois state university 
the fordyce suit alleged that the neasupported catalog for the 
wojnarowicz show includes an image depicting jesus christ as an 
intravenous drug user it said the catalogue also refers to roman 
catholic cardinal john oconnor of new york as a fat cannibal 
and the worlds most active liar about condoms and safer sex 
fordyce said nea support for the catalog conveys a message of 
hate and animosity toward institutionalized religion sponsored by 
the federal government in violation of the first amendments 
provision for separation of church and state 
he asked the court for a permanent injunction prohibiting the 
arts endowment from funding sponsoring and endorsing works which 
promote blasphemous and sacrilegious hate material 
the endowment an independent 171 million federal agency that 
underwrites a wide variety of artists and arts organizations had 
no immediate comment on the lawsuit 
the nea is embroiled in a controversy over art obscenity and 
freedom of expression stemming from allegations by religious 
fundamentalists and conservative lawmakers led by sen jesse helms 
rnc that it has subsidized obscene and sacrilegious works 
the endowment already is the target of two other federal 
lawsuits in new york and los angeles challenging frohnmayers 
requirement that grant recipients sign a pledge of compliance with 
a congressional ban on using federal funds for works that may be 
deemed obscene 
wojnarowicz could not be reached by telephone for comment but 
barry blinderman director of the illinois gallery accused the 
lawsuits sponsors of hypocrisy and angrily defended the 
artists work against charges of sacrilege 
before these people condemn the nea they should remember that 
it was the socalled holy men who didnt accept christ and turned 
him in blinderman said jesus said judge not and i 
recommend that these people follow the precepts of the god they are 
proclaiming 
the tongues of flame exhibit opened at blindermans gallery 
earlier this year and is now appearing at the santa monica museum 
of art in california 
john w whitehead founder and president of the rutherford 
institute told a news conference here that the nea had 
unconstitutionally used taxpayers funds to engage in actions 
which are hostile toward religion and religious persons 
the government should not become the patron of hate art 
against some of its citizens whitehead said religious people 
must no longer be the personal targets of cannon fire from national 
endowment projects 
wojnarowicz previously had filed a federal lawsuit in new york 
against the rev donald wildmon and his conservative american 
family association 
in late june a new york federal judge ruled that wildmons 
group probably had misrepresented wojnarowiczs works by including 
fragments of them in a pamphlet titled your tax dollars helped 
pay for these works of art 
the judge said the pamphlets which were mailed to members of 
congress religious leaders and media outlets probably had damaged 
the artists reputation and the value of his works he issued an 
injunction forbidding further publication of the pamphlet

syrian military forces killed dozens of 
demonstrators backing saddam hussein in protests near the iraqi 
border arab diplomats and security sources reported wednesday 
as many as 50000 troops were deployed along the iraqsyria 
border after the army quelled violent protests sunday and monday 
according to officials who spoke on condition they not be named 
crowds of syrians poured into the streets of eastern towns 
sunday to protest president hafez assads stand against iraq the 
sources said 
a syrian information ministry official reached by telephone 
from amman denied there were any demonstrations and said he had no 
knowledge of troop movements he declined to be named 
the outbreaks of violence in syria could become a threat to 
assad a former air force commander who seized power in november 
1970 assad and saddam have waged an ideological feud for more than 
a decade syria and iraq are ruled by rival wings of the baath 
socialist party 
during the 198088 iraniraq war assad was tehrans main arab 
ally 
diplomats and arab officials in amman said their embassies in 
damascus the capital of neighboring syria reported scattered 
uprisings 
troops tried all day to stop the demonstrations and reports 
from our damascus embassy said tens of people were killed one 
arab diplomat said others reported similar death tolls 
demonstrators surged into the streets carrying huge portraits 
of saddam chanting slogans and waving iraqi flags the reports 
said some demanded separation from syria to merge with iraq 
eastern syria is predominantly sunni moslem assad and most of 
his ruling faction are from the minority alawite sect centered in 
western syria 
the rioting is believed to be the worst violence in syria since 
assad crushed a moslem brotherhood uprising in hama north of 
damascus in 1982 tanks ringed hama and pounded it razing much of 
the ancient city and killing thousands 
during the hama violence syrian officials flatly denied any 
disturbances until four days after riots began and the death toll 
was already in the hundreds 
following iraqs invasion of kuwait aug 2 assad sent at least 
1100 troops to join an arab force gathering in saudi arabia to 
protect the kingdom 
assad postponed a scheduled trip to egypt on sunday without 
explanation but flew to alexandria tuesday for a day of talks with 
president hosni mubarak 
travelers from syria reported tensions were high but none who 
had visited the turbulent eastern part of the country would confirm 
reports of violence 
i know nothing i cant say anything one trucker said 
hurrying away visibly frightened

if the group had been able to perform on the beach things might 
have been better

a major arabamerican organization began a 
nationwide petition campaign wednesday urging saddam hussein to 
release all foreign nationals being held hostage in iraq and kuwait 
james abourezk chairman of the americanarab 
antidiscrimination committee said he hoped to personally present 
the petition to the iraqi president in baghdad 
abourezk a former senator from south dakota said the iraqi 
embassy in washington had not replied to the committees request to 
send a delegation to baghdad 
he said he didnt know whether the petition would sway saddam to 
release foreign hostages but it would be remiss on our part not 
to try 
the appeal says the release of those held against their will 
would lessen the extreme tension in the middle east and could 
lead to a resolution of the crisis 
adcs washington headquarters is sending the petition to all 
25000 of its members in 70 nationwide chapters it hopes to obtain 
tens of thousands of signatures from arabamericans and other 
american citizens there are about 25 million people of arab 
origins in the united states 
iraq has detained thousands of foreigners including about 3000 
americans since its aug 2 invasion of kuwait some of the 
foreigners have been moved to key installations to act as human 
shields against an attack from the united states or other foreign 
forces 
the petition campaign coincides with the groups efforts to 
combat what it calls a disturbing increase in antiarab 
discrimination in the united states since the gulf crisis began 
the committee has chronicled several dozen cases of 
arabamericans being threatened or attacked in the united states 
it also blamed the media particularly radio talk shows for 
stirring up antiarab sentiments through racist or discriminatory 
remarks 
we are trying to do away with an incredible amount of 
stereotyping and racism said abdeen jabara outgoing committee 
president

the main fundamentalist moslem movement in the 
occupied territories on wednesday urged iraq to withdraw from 
kuwait saying that palestinians are aware more than others of 
the meaning of losing a homeland 
it was the strongest antiiraq statement to date in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip where palestinians have shown strong 
support for iraqi leader saddam hussein since his aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait 
the appeal came in a leaflet issued by the hamas or zeal 
movement 
in a separate leaflet the underground leadership of the 
palestinian uprising repeated its opposition to the deployment of 
us forces in the gulf 
the underground leaders backed by the palestine liberation 
organization urged saddam not to respond to provocations or take 
measures that could be seen as reasons for the us launching an 
aggression against iraq 
both leaflets called for the withdrawal of foreign forces from 
the gulf and their replacement by arab peacekeepers 
the position taken by hamas was a shift from its last leaflet 
which focused on aggression by america and all its devilish 
allies but said nothing about iraqs move against kuwait 
moslem fundamentalists here who want an islamic state are wary 
of saddam because he has been an advocate of secularism hamas has 
been a leading force in the nearly 33monthold palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza 
in its latest leaflet hamas said we are aware more than 
others of the meaning of losing a homeland and the pains of exile 
we are aware of the agony of the moslem kuwaiti people 
the leaflet called for kuwaiti selfdetermination along with 
negotiations to resolve iraqikuwaiti tensions 
any solution must include the withdrawal of foreign forces 
from the region and the withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait 
hamas said 
meanwhile israels interior ministry banned palestinian 
professor ghassan khatib from traveling abroad khatib an 
economist at the west banks bir zeit university was the fourth 
palestinian blocked from attending a convention in switzerland on 
grounds it would endanger israeli security 
i think this is part of new restrictions they israels 
government are using right now taking advantage of the gulf 
crisis to put more pressures on palestinians khatib said they 
know the world is focused on the gulf and will not pay any 
attention to their measures 
also wednesday the body of a palestinian suspected of 
collaborating with israeli authorities was found near his home in 
the tulkarem refugee camp in the west bank the victim was 
identified by arab reporters as faisal mansuri 35 
the death raised to 254 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs in the uprising at least 728 palestinians have been 
killed by israeli soldiers or civilians and 47 israelis have died 
in the violence

in the townships around johannesburg on aug 12 
lowlevel delegations from inkatha and the anc have met 
previously but anc leaders have refused to meet zulu leader 
mangosuthu buthelezi they contend inkatha spread the conflict to 
the johannesburg area this month to broaden its constituency 
inkatha accuses the anc of terrorizing other black opposition 
groups to try to consolidate power 
inkatha and the anc both oppose apartheid south africas system 
of racial separation but they differ on ways to fight it 
buthelezi reiterated his call wednesday for a meeting with anc 
deputy president nelson mandela he also said in a statement the 
anc should end instead of merely suspending its armed struggle 
and stop calling for sanctions to push south africa to end 
apartheid 
the violence around johannesburg has eased markedly since the 
initial days of fighting when dozens of blacks were killed daily 
but protests against the fighting and allegations of police bias 
toward inkatha have continued 
in cape town on wednesday police fired tear gas and birdshot at 
students from the university of the western cape near cape town 
who were protesting the recent violence witnesses said 
police maj gys boonzaaier told the independent south africa 
press association the students were throwing rocks at police and 
passing vehicles 
separate protests against the fighting also were held in 
johannesburg and pretoria 
police used batons and tear gas to disperse a march by students 
from the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg sapa 
reported fortysix students were arrested and two police officers 
slightly injured police said 
later students from several organizations held a protest along 
a downtown street to protest the police action 
riot police in pretoria halted a march by students of the 
medical univerity of south africa police and the universitys 
rector said the students said they had not sought permission for 
the march 
in the township violence two men were hacked to death and set 
alight at a migrant workers hostel in tembisa northeast of 
johannesburg while another died at a hostel in katlehong 
southeast of the city police said 
some antiapartheid leaders have blamed police for fueling the 
fighting in the townships 
president fw de klerk told anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
and other church leaders tuesday he would investigate charges that 
police sided with inkatha 
de klerk has previously said individual officers may have acted 
improperly but that the police force as a whole followed orders to 
be impartial

a chemist says he has determined that 
zinc plays a key role in the spread of the aids virus which could 
lead to a vaccine or drugs to combat the disease 
michael summers a chemistry professor at the university of 
maryland baltimore county said tuesday he had found that zinc is 
the glue that binds one protein critical to the virus duplication 
to the genetic material that makes the virus infectious 
zinc is present in the body if researchers can develop a drug 
that alters eliminates or masks the zinc the infectious material 
wont exist when new virus cells are formed summers told reporters 
this research has important implications for the development 
of an aids vaccine summers said he said healthy people could be 
injected with noninfectious virus to make them develop an immunity 
to the infectious form 
he emphasized that a vaccine was still a long way off but said 
the research provides another avenue for pharmaceutical companies 
developing drugs against aids 
summers findings were published tuesday in biochemistry a 
weekly journal of the american chemical society 
he said the results are similar to those that led to the 
development of the aidsfighting drug azt aids attacks the bodys 
immune system rendering it helpless to fight disease 
a biochemist at the johns hopkins university school of medicine 
agreed that the findings are an important albeit small step 
it really does present a new avenue of research which had been 
at least underappreciated if not completely unrecognized said 
jeremy berg who suggested zinc as a molecular glue in certain 
viruses four years ago 
wayne koff an aids vaccine researcher at the national 
institutes of health in bethesda md called the findings 
interesting 
in addition to potentially being an approach for development 
of vaccines this research has provided potentially another target 
for drug development said koff 
summers said scientists at the national cancer institute in 
frederick have begun work on a drug based on his research but 
cautioned that theres no known way to alter the zinc 
berg said that even if summers research leads to a vaccine it 
may not be effective in all cases 
there are so many different forms of the virus and it changes 
so quickly even if you were immune to one type of the virus you 
probably wouldnt be immune to other types he said

the state department said today that iraqs 
promise to allow all foreign women and children to leave the 
country is a significant step in the right direction if it is 
carried out 
it said the iraqi announcement could affect about 1000 american 
women and children 
this announcement of saddam hussein if implemented is a 
significant step in the right direction we have heard statements 
like this before and we hope saddam hussein will have the human 
decency to live up to his word said department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler 
she said that about a third of the approximately 3000 american 
citizens in kuwait and iraq are women and children she said there 
are about 500 women in kuwait 25 of whom are pregnant 350 
children ages 3 to 18 and 60 infants under 3 years of age she 
did not have a precise breakdown for iraq 
ms tutwiler said the united states would prefer that the 
americans be evacuated via charter aircraft from kuwait city and 
baghdad 
she spoke after the iraq ambassador formally notified the state 
department of saddams decision announced tuesday 
ambassador mohamed almashat told reporters after meeting with 
department officials that the americans will be allowed to leave 
through jordan or turkey but gave no timetable for their departure 
it is not possible administratively that everybody go on the 
same day almashat said he said he did not know whether the 
iraqi government would provide aircraft to facilitate the 
departures 
almashat said once the united states gives assurances that 
they are not going to strike iraq and attack iraq or aggress upon 
iraq then we are going to let even men out 
in response ms tutwiler said the united states rejects the 
notion that there should be any conditions attached to the 
immediate safe departure of all foreign nationals including 
americans who wish to depart from iraq and kuwait

life prison terms for the murders that she blamed on her husband

but outside the courtroom with sheriffs deputies at her side 
mrs lundgren wept as she read a statement of remorse 
i am not a coldblooded murderer he is mrs lundgren told

i too was numbered on the list of intended victims she 
said i am not the angel of death i am the mother of four 
mrs lundgren was convicted aug 1 on all counts against her

the federal trade commission warned consumers 
wednesday to be leery of energy saving schemes saying the public 
can be duped by getrich proposals and devices claiming to save 
gasoline 
unscrupulous individuals often attempt to exploit situations 
like the present one by taking advantage of consumers said ftc 
chairman janet steiger 
the ftc was joined in the warning by the national association of 
attorneys general 
attorney general mary sue terry of virginia president of the 
association noted that with the labor day weekend ahead 
consumers should stay away from devices or fuel additives that 
claim to significantly increase fuel mileage 
rising energy prices and concern about future oil supplies is 
likely to unleash an array of fraudulent schemes ranging from the 
sale of phony gassaving devices to oil and gas investment frauds 
the ftc said 
among the things the ftc warned consumers about were 
phony investment schemes involving oil or gas partnerships 
gold and silver mining or oil drilling that promise much higher 
rates of return than normally might be expected 
when wall street is jittery all kinds of investment scams 
appear warned the ftc 
energy saving devices such as surge suppressors or furnace 
duty cyclers that may be costly without providing significant 
energy savings 
home improvement scams including the sale of improper solar 
energy systems storm windows siding or insulation in some cases 
the promised energy savings may never be achieved the agency said 
if the savings claims appear unrealistic they probably are 
said the ftc 
gadgets or gasoline additives that are supposed to improve 
automobile mileage none of these products has been found to 
significantly increase fuel economy said the ftc 
the agency suggested the best ways to save gasoline is to 
inflate tires to their proper pressure remove excess weight from 
the cars trunk and make sure the car is properly tuned it also 
advised against use of high octane gasoline unless it is 
recommended in the automobile manuel higher octane gasoline is 
more expensive and often does not improve car performance 
the ftc also warned the public to be aware of telemarketing 
techniques that offer great bargains because of the oil crisis 
and reminded that calls to 900 numbers often cost from 2 to 
45 a minute 
telemarketing techniques themselves are not deceptive indeed 
many reputable companies use them but in the hands of unscrupulous 
individuals they can hurt consumers said the ftc

the us ambassador to jordan waited at the iraqi border today 
to see if saddam hussein would make good on his promise to release 
western women and children held in iraq 
the state department called the iraqi offer tuesday a 
significant step in the right direction if it is carried out 
it said the iraqi announcement could affect about 1000 american 
women and children 
iraqs ambassador to the united states today refused to give a 
timetable for their departure but said iraq would also free the 
detained men after getting assurances from the united states that 
it would not attack 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk told reporters i have no 
evidence indicating that people have been allowed to leave 
the spokesman also refused to confirm or deny a report that the 
administration had received a message from the iraqi president 
offering to pull out his invading troops from kuwait with 
conditions 
in another development opec voted to increase its oil 
production to make up for shortages caused by the embargo on iraqi 
and kuwaiti oil 
japan promised to send money medical personnel and nonmilitary 
supplies to the persian gulf but not soldiers weapons or other 
military supplies however the aid package also will allow japan 
to pay other countries chartering ships and planes to carry 
military cargo to the gulf 
thirteen people who were part of the us mobilization died 
today when a giant c5a cargo plane en route to the persian gulf 
region crashed on takeoff from ramstein air base in west germany 
there were four survivors 
president bush today delivered a pep talk to us troops 
broadcast over armed forces radio he said their assignment in 
saudi arabia and elsewhere in the gulf is one of the toughest 
military missions in modern memory 
you stand on the front line against aggression and 
international lawlessness bush said we have never sought 
conflict nor do we hope to chart a course for other nations but at 
the hands of injustice in the face of aggression ours is a once 
reluctant fist now clutched resolutely 
many in the region apparently did not immediately hear it 
because the radio network does not have a transmitter in saudi 
arabia the only place it could be received there is at permanent 
us barracks on saudi military bases 
saddam announced tuesday that the women and children among the 
thousands of foreigtn hostages in iraq could leave today 
however no western hostages had crossed the jordanian border by 
midafternoon and reports from baghdad said their departure was 
stalled because they did not have the required exit visas 
in washington iraqi ambassador mohamed almashat told reporters 
after meeting with state department officials that the americans 
will be allowed to leave through jordan or turkey but gave no 
timetable for their departure 
almashat said once the united states gives assurances that 
they are not going to strike iraq and attack iraq or aggress upon 
iraq then we are going to let even men out 
a handful of westerners today arrived from baghdad on a iraqi 
airways flight to amman the jordanian capital but none appeared 
to belong to the hostage group of women and children who were told 
they are free to leave iraq 
ambassador roger harrison traveled to the jordanian border post 
of ruweishid 210 miles northeast of amman to supervise the 
reception of any american women and children arriving there the 
embassy said 
american diplomatic officials have manned the border 
roundtheclock for two weeks in case any us hostages were freed 
harrisons presence suggested new arrivals were imminent 
british officials told iraq today they are ready to send 
aircraft to baghdad to pick up western women and children but they 
also said they doubted the sincerity of saddams offer 
it is a cat and mouse game now a little mercy now some more 
ruthlessness foreign secretary douglas hurd said in london 
his purpose as far as one can tell is to keep the human shield 
policy but divert attention by little acts of mercy from the main 
and totally unacceptable policy 
a senior jordanian official at ruweishid said by telephone that 
he expected a number of freed westerners to pass through the border 
point today but he was unsure when they might arrive 
prime minister toshiki kaifu said today that japan will not 
transport soldiers or weapons to the persian gulf but he pledged 
money medical personnel and nonmilitary supplies the assistance 
package unveiled in a nationally televised speech fell short of 
the aid sought by the united states 
us ambassador to japan michael h armacost on tuesday night 
had urged tokyo to help transport soldiers and weapons 
while japanese craft would not be used to ferry military 
personnel or weapons the package will allow payment to other 
nations chartering transportation carrying such cargo the 
constitution japan drew up with us help after world war ii bars 
tokyo from sending troops overseas 
in vienna today opec oil cartel ministers approved a deal 
permitting increased production by saudi arabia venezuela and some 
other nations to help offset losses arising from the shortfall 
caused by the persian gulf crisis 
the embargo against iraqi and kuwaiti oil removed about 4 
millions barrels of oil a day from world markets driving up the 
price of heating oil and gas 
meanwhile the buildup of troops and hardware showed no sign of 
letup on either side of the saudikuwait border 
the pentagon said iraqi troop strength in and around kuwait has 
increased to 265000 and dozens of heavy us tanks arrived in 
saudi arabia on tuesday and wheeled northward into the desert 
on the diplomatic side un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar was to hold talks thursday in jordan with iraqs foreign 
minister on the crisis that began with iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
oilrich kuwait 
saddams promise to free all the foreign women and children came 
in a statement from iraqs revolutionary command council the move 
came hours after iraqi television showed saddam meeting captive 
foreign families and hearing them express concern for their 
children 
the official iraqi news agency said the decision was made to 
preserve the arab humanitarian image 
the iraqi news agency said the foreigners could leave starting 
today it was not known how many women and children were among the 
hostages in iraq or whether the decree also applies to foreigners 
in kuwait 
saddam has detained 21000 westerners about 3000 americans 
were in kuwait and 500 in iraq during the invasion but an 
undetermined number have escaped 
british and us officials say iraq has moved more than 150 
britons and more than 60 americans from kuwait to strategic 
locations for use as human shields against a possible attack 
iraqs troop strength in and near kuwait has increased to 
265000 soldiers supported by larger numbers of tanks and 
artillery the pentagon said tuesday 
theres been a general trend in the past several days of these 
numbers increasing said pete williams the defense department 
spokesman 
last week secretary of defense dick cheney said 160000 to 
200000 iraqi troops were in kuwait and southern iraq together with 
an estimated 1000 tanks 
about 60000 us troops backed by dozens of planes and dozens 
of warships have assembled in the persian gulf region since the 
iraqi invasion 
it was unclear how many troops in the region heard bushs 
message armed forces radio has some satellite receiver stations in 
the area but they are not fully operational maj lon oakley said 
from mcdill air force base in florida

armenias parliament put the republic under 
emergency rule banned a nationalist paramilitary group and blocked 
roads around the capital wednesday after a string of attacks left 
an armenian legislator dead 
the central soviet government was not involved in the decision 
a curfew from 10 pm to 6 am was imposed throughout the 
republic and an interior ministry officer said troops with armored 
vehicles were guarding all roads to yerevan the capital allowing 
passage only by special permit 
armenian president levon terpetrosyan appealed in a radio 
broadcast for calm i assure you that we the armenian 
authorities are in a position to eliminate the danger posed by 
this armed organization terpetrosyan said there should be no 
panicking 
alexander arzumanyan a spokesman for the armenian national 
movement and raffi hovannisian a yerevan representative of the 
armenian assembly of america said in telephone interviews that the 
attacks began early wednesday 
according to their description of events members of the 
renegade armenian national army attacked a gas station and shot and 
wounded three people 
an armenian legislator viktor aivazian was then shot to death 
as he approached the headquarters of the armenian national army to 
investigate the gas station incident also killed in the shooting 
was gehavnik manukyan an officer of armed armenian national 
movement troops loyal to the republics government 
later wednesday members of the armenian national army attacked 
the headquarters of the armenian nationalist movement with 
automatic weapons according to the official tass news agency tass 
said the attack lasted about an hour no casualties were reported 
also wednesday another member of armenias parliament rafael 
ishkhanian was run over by a vehicle without plates and was in 
critical condition hovannisian said 
it was unclear if ishkhanian was hit deliberately but 
hovannisian said the parliament stood for a moment of silence for 
both aivazian and ishkhanian before unanimously adopting the state 
of emergency 
parliament also banned the armenian national army which was 
formed in january and claims to protect armenians from attacks by 
armed groups from the neighboring republic of azerbaijan however 
ana members have attacked police stations and gasoline depots in 
armenia to seize the weapons and fuel they need to fight 
azerbaijanis 
armenia which is mostly christian and azerbaijan which is 
mostly moslem have been engaged for more than two years in a 
bloody dispute for jurisdiction over nagornokarabakh a largely 
armenian enclave that lies within azerbaijan at least 300 people 
have been killed in the fighting 
at times armenian officials have appeared to tolerate the 
armenian national army which is believed to have several hundred 
hardcore fighters and many more sympathizers but on wednesday 
the republics leaders formally outlawed the vigilante group 
the peoples patience has run out terpetrosyan said in his 
radio address they can no longer bear the adventurism of these 
armed detachments which endanger both the security of our citizens 
and the formation of our statehood 
parliament demanded that members of the armenian national army 
turn in their weapons by wednesday night and hand over the 
buildings and vehicles they have seized it said members of the 
group who comply would receive an amnesty and that those who 
resisted would be detained and punished with the strict severity 
of the law 
the armenian legislators themselves ardent nationalists who 
have declared independence from the soviet union said the state 
of emergency would be imposed solely by police and troops under 
their control not by soviet forces 
an interior ministry duty officer in yerevan who declined to be 
identified by name said all vehicles trying to enter the city 
would be turned away unless they had permits from local 
authorities he said this was to prevent more armenian national 
army units from reaching the city 
he also said azerbaijanis had shut off the only natural gas 
pipeline to yerevan leaving most of the citys 12 million 
residents without cooking fuel 
the state of emergency in armenia is different in key respects 
from one declared in azerbaijan on jan 15 in azerbaijan soviet 
authorities imposed the emergency after gangs in the capital baku 
attacked armenians and 25 people were reported killed 
it has been lifted throughout the republic except in baku and 
along the armenian border 
armenias parliament passed a declaration of independence last 
week becoming the fifth soviet republic to vote to sever from the 
central soviet state armenia which borders turkey and iran has 
33 million people 
the independence declaration calls for creation of armenias own 
armed forces to safeguard the border which last week was the scene

vice president dan quayle said wednesday 
that the threat to peace posed by iraqi president saddam hussein 
vindicates the republicanled us military buildup of the past 
decade 
and he said it proves more than ever the need for the strategic 
defense initiative 
addressing the 72nd annual meeting of the american legion 
quayle said the lessening of eastwest tension has not diminished 
the need for a strong national defense including the sdi space 
shield against nuclear weapons 
as the cold war comes to an end the free world may be less 
burdened with fighting communist aggression but theres a new 
evil lawlessness and terrorism quayle told the veterans 
there are still brutal dictators who prefer the rule of the 
jungle instead of the rule of law he said 
saddam hussein has used chemical weapons on his own people 
supports terrorism and uses americans and others as human shields 
quayle said 
quayle said president bush will not be satisfied until iraq 
withdraws all of its forces from kuwait and ensures the security of 
saudi arabia and the rest of the oilrich gulf region 
make no mistake about it what is at stake in the persian gulf 
is nothing less than the shape of tomorrow quayle said 
this is the first international crisis in the postcold war 
era if saddam husseins aggression remains unchecked new and more 
terrible aggression will surely follow the vice president said 
quayle criticized congress for recent cuts in defense programs 
that would leave us military forces with fewer options and less 
preparation to deal with sudden crises such as the current one in 
the gulf 
he said he was grateful for the general military buildup that 
has occurred under bush and former president reagan and he called 
for new investment in research and development and in the sdi 
system sometimes referred to as star wars 
iraq and other regional powers are gaining ballistic missile 
capability he said 
thats why the president thinks strategic defense makes more 
sense in the 1990s than ever before quayle said that is why 
we will continue our work to slow and stop the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them 
quayle a former indiana senator whose own national guard rather 
than regular military service became a campaign liability two years 
ago was interrupted frequently with applause and by two standing 
ovations 
that contrasted with the cool reception he received during a 
1989 speech to a veterans of foreign wars meeting 
quayle drew chuckles when he refered to president bushs 
celebrated campaign gaffe before the legion two years ago when he 
said pearl harbor day was sept 7 1941 instead of dec 7 
i was with the president this morning to ask him for a few 
tips of what i ought to say today he told me the exciting time he 
had talking to you two years ago but that i should be especially 
careful if i start talking about pearl harbor

this volleyball game like those on 
california beaches is played in the sand but theres no ocean in 
the saudi desert and the troops at play are wearing boots and 
bulky uniform pants 
several miles away at another camp for american troops the 
helicopter mechanics are just getting up as the sun goes down if 
they were lucky enough to catch some sleep during the scorching hot 
day 
further down the road some marines are adopting an arab custom 
covering their heads and necks mostly with tshirts to block the 
sun 
to beat the heat and the boredom american troops are sleeping 
during the day working at night and trying to organize 
recreational activities to make a faraway place a bit more 
bearable 
the helicopter mechanics are among a growing number of troops 
who do their work at night to escape the heat of day which often 
reaches 120 degrees one maintenance worker 35yearold gary stutz 
from macguire air force base in new jersey says he and his 
coworkers slowly are adjusting 
he says the air force is helping by getting the men desert 
uniforms and lighter boots with a cloth upper body instead of 
leather 
air force sgt david klunkers solution to the heat is to take 
off his shirt but hes been told its against the rules 
three weeks into the deployment of us troops here some say 
theyre geting used to the heat others say they never will 
air force sgt alan wagner of davenport iowa is among those 
who say they are beginning to get used to it 
it was unbearable at first he said after arriving wagner 
said he worked 40 hours and nearly passed out i dont normally 
sweat but i was getting dizzy he said 
military hospitals and medics are treating dozens of people a 
day for heatrelated ailments mostly minor cases of dehydration 
some troops are out in the desert during the day training under 
the hottest sun to get acclimated 
others are taking some steps to ease the load on the weary 
troops 
at the 82nd airborne camp physical exercises primarily walks 
and jogging are done in the early morning and late afternoon 
we found that water consumption went way down when we started 
doing it that way said maj baxter ennis the divisions public 
affairs officer weve learned to adjust to get the guys used to 
the climate but then to try to do most of the other work at times 
other than the middle of the day 
they may be split over their tolerance to the heat but troops 
visited this past week were unanimous in saying there was a need 
for more recreational activities 
we train and sit train and sit said one army lieutenant on 
condition of anonymity how can you not be bored 
at the 82nd airborne divisions camp the volleyball game is a 
big hit some of these paratroopers have been here for three 
weeks with little or no contact from home and instructions not to 
venture into saudi cities 
the 82nd among the first units into saudi arabia is also 
leading the effort to improve recreation activities for the troops 
in addition to volleyball touch football games are now a staple 
at the 82nds camp some of the later arrivals even have shorts and 
running shoes 
the guys who packed up on a minutes notice have to tough it 
out in boots said ennis 
he commandeered a box of books for the unit and was in town 
wednesday seeking to bargain with the us consulate for a major 
prize a movie projector 
weve got one on the way from fort bragg ennis said but 
the guys could use one now

multinational forces in saudi 
arabia have ironed out a relationship allowing troops to stay under 
their national command while conducting joint training exercises 
the system seems to be working but saudis and americans are 
deliberately vague about who would take charge if hostilities break 
out with iraqi forces 
lt gen khalid bin sultan head of the joint arab islamic task 
force refused to answer questions about plans for combat saying 
he didnt want to tip his hand to the enemy 
the standard answer is that all command relationships are 
still being worked out said lt col john olsen a spokesman at 
the us central command headquarters in saudi arabia 
the consensus is the united states with the largest military 
force in the country and its array of weaponry would call many of 
the shots in a combat situation consulting with the saudis because 
of their sovereignty 
the saudis total military force with a predominance in the air 
force numbers about 65000 
we are not going to do anything unilaterally said one 
american official on condition of anonymity if we do anything in 
that area it will be by agreement with the saudis 
any decision to attack kuwait or iraq would need approval at the 
highest levels meaning king fahd and president bush officials 
from both nations said 
meanwhile officials are trying to coodinate the air land and 
naval operations in which at least 22 nations say they are involved 
or will join 
the difficulty in bridging language cultural and political gaps 
has caused some frustration among the military officials said air 
force lt gen charles horner the first onsite american commander 
and now the no 2 man 
learning to be patient and adapt to the saudi style of doing 
business was difficult when youre charging and trying to get the 
job done he said 
the air defense system based at a huge air base here is 
running smoothly after some initial kinks officials said 
communications were under some pressure at first said 
british defense secretary tom king 
the saudis the americans and the british keep their planes near 
each other but separate 
saudi pilots fly both americanbuilt f15s and britishbuilt 
tornados the british have dispatched their own squadron while the 
americans have a tactical wing here 
everything is done jointly said prince turki bin nasser 
head of the air base 
the operations are meshed on a daytoday basis with each 
service responsible for a geographic area officials said the 
coordination is easy because the saudi pilots have either trained 
in the united states or in britain 
american military officials have said the us forces are under 
strict orders to avoid initiating combat in response to actions by 
iraq that fall short of actual combat or a clearcut invasion of 
saudi arabia 
on the ground the saudis have put about 2000 men in frontline 
positions a short distance from its borders with iraq and kuwait 
so that they not americans would take the first hits if a 
ground war erupted 
the saudis felt they had to be at the front one american 
said 
the saudis are directing a combined gulf cooperation council 
force in the northeastern part of the country near the kuwaitsaudi 
border 
the gulf nations force from saudi arabia bahrain oman 
united arab emirates and qatar numbered 10000 before iraqs aug 
2 of kuwait and will be increased officials said 
some 2000 egyptians 1200 moroccans and 1000 syrians also are 
on the ground but they are removed from the front line and do not 
intermingle 
in the persian gulf warships remain independent and under their 
own flag they try to avoid conflicts with each other by notifying 
one another about actions

defense lawyers in the racially tinged case of 
a marine facing the first military execution in 29 years argued 
wednesday that sections of the military death penalty are 
unconstitutional 
murder defendants in military trials dont have the same 
protections as civilians in state courts attorneys for lance cpl 
ronnie curtis told the us court of military appeals 
the court appointed lawyers lt cmdr john b holt and civilian 
robert morin also argued that president reagan abused his 
executive privilege in 1984 by signing an order outlining whom the 
military may sentence to death 
congress has not decided congress has not delegated this 
power to the president holt told three civilian judges of the 
military appeals court 
curtis who is black contends racial taunts drove him to kill 
lt james lotz and lotzs wife joan at camp lejeune nc on 
april 13 1987 
curtis who confessed to a state trooper and to investigators 
was sentenced to death after being convicted in a military trial 
he is being held at fort leavenworth kan 
the appeals court allowed television cameras to broadcast the 
proceedings live for the first time on the cspan cable network 
curtis did not attend the hearing 
the case is seen by attorneys on both sides as a test of the 
military death penalty in murder cases among the many intervenors 
is the naacp legal defense and educational fund which said curtis 
courtmartial was tainted by racial bias 
in civilian courts a lot of issues relating to capital 
punishment have been considered for years ronald wright of the 
wake forest university law school said in an interview this is a 
chance for the military to ask if its system measures up 
wright filed a friend of the court brief in the case 
the court is considering the appeal in two stages a ruling is 
expected by late september on the constitutional challenge if 
curtis loses that he will be permitted a second appeal that could 
consider the composition of the military jury and other racial 
issues lawyers said 
curtis the adopted son of a workingclass couple from wichita 
kan could take his case to the us supreme court if he loses his 
appeals 
a key element of the appeal is that curtis was sentenced by a 
ninemember courtmartial panel even though all states with death 
penalties require 12member sentencing juries in capital cases 
military law requires only five panelists a provision morin 
said could deprive defendants of substantial input and 
consideration 
the government says the constitution does not require a 
12person panel and that defendants can get fair sentences with 
fewer members 
curtis then 21 was convicted of fatally stabbing lotz a 
scranton pa native who was his section officer then stabbing 
lotzs wife and sexually abusing her as she lay dying in her home 
curtis lawyers said in appeal papers that lotz who was white 
antagonized curtis by imitating what he believed were black 
mannerisms and by calling curtis bebop and shoobedo 
you wanted a dog you snapped your fingers you called me 
names you wanted a dog heres your dog right here curtis said 
at the courtmartial 
the military said lotz did call men by nicknames but that the 
trial record showed that the use of the names was not racial and 
that the lieutenant was not racist 
the courtmartial panel of nine enlisted men and officers 
included three blacks the naacp said the military judge allowed 
prosecutors to evoke racial bias by permitting such evidence as 
mrs lotzs bloodsoaked underwear which prosecutors said was 
relevant to their case 
curtis lawyers argued wednesday that congress never granted 
authority for reagans 1984 executive order defining who is subject 
to capital punishment in the military 
but the government said congress gave the president power for 
the order by creating a military conduct code in 1950 
the last military execution was in 1961 when a soldier was 
hanged for rape and attempted murder the military has built a 
chamber at fort leavenworth designed for lethal injections

riot police wielded batons and fired 
tear gas wednesday to disperse thousands of ethnic albanians 
awaiting a us congressional delegation to complain about alleged 
human rights abuses 
but a statement by yugoslavian president borisav jovic issued 
after earlier talks with the seven republican senators said the 
ethnic albanians in the southern kosovo province have far greater 
rights than minorities in other european countries 
in pristina riot police dispersed an estimated 10000 people 
who chanted freedom freedom and usa usa 
a belgrade television station reported 46 people were arrested 
and more than 20 were injured including seven police officers two 
squad cars and several passenger vehicles were demolished 
the delegation headed by us sen robert dole of kansas 
arrived under heavy police escort about three hours after the clash 
with protesters some of whom pelted police with rocks and bottles 
the senators will see for themselves what kind of police 
repression we live under said ibrahim rugova head of the 
500300member democratic union the largest ethnic albanian 
political party in the region 
rugova and other ethnic albanian leaders spent nearly seven 
hours with the senators who were accompanied by us ambassador 
warren zimmermann 
later the group met with representatives of the rival serbian 
community and the serbian orthodox church 
earlier wednesday the senators met in belgrade with jovic and 
other senior officials the national news agency tanjug quoted 
jovic an ethnic serb as rejecting claims of human rights abuses 
in kosovo 
ethnic albanians have far greater rights than are generally 
accorded to national minorities in other european states he was 
quoted as saying the crux of the problem in kosovo lies in the 
attempt to secede from both serbia and yugoslavia 
ethnic albanians comprise about 90 percent of the 19 million 
people in kosovo province an administrative district of serbia 
kosovo has been the scene of tension since serbian officials began 
to restrict the provinces selfgovernment last year 
several yugoslav and international human rights organizations 
including amnesty international and the viennabased helsinki 
watch this year criticized serbia for its treatment of kosovos 
ethnic albanians 
the regions sole albanianlanguage daily was banned in july 
and several kosovo independent trade union activists have been 
jailed for calling for a general strike for sept 3 
serbian authorities in kosovo have said they will keep ethnic 
albanian political parties from taking part in the provinces 
multiparty elections expected to be held by the end of the year 
accompanying dole on the trip are sens john warner of virginia 
jake garn of utah don nickels of oklahoma alfonse damato of new

the state of florida and the army have 
agreed to work together to find civilian jobs for soldiers put out 
of work by the end of the cold war 
despite the current deployment of thousands of us soldiers in 
the mideast the 764000 active duty forces will be pared down 
during the next few years and could see annual cuts of 35000 
according to michael stone secretary of the army 
it is what becomes of those 35000 soldiers per year that 
were talking about today stone told gov bob martinez and the 
cabinet on tuesday 
the project involves finding soldiers jobs as teachers 
truckers health care workers and law enforcement officers the 
state plans to send out brochures and offer a hotline number 
promoting job counseling services for outofwork soldiers 
florida will become the first state in our country to 
implement programs that will help military personnel with 
education training and job placement services education 
commissioner betty castor said 
although stone said it was not inappropriate to make plans for 
the future of the army with the unfolding persian gulf crisis he 
said personnel cutbacks would be put on hold until the 
confrontation is resolved 
but he thanked the state for its willingness to be out front 
in such an important project 
the army has not yet worked out similar agreements with other 
states because it had concentrated on negotiating a bellwether 
agreement with florida stone said 
florida stood up and said yes well work with you in the 
army he said 
tom heath vice president for comcar services an 
auburndalebased trucking company has recruited veterans on his 
own and will also participate in the project 
the more of these people we get the better off were all 
going to be he said 
stone said soldiers have many appealing qualities for 
prospective employers 
ninetyfive percent of the armys soldiers have high school 
diplomas and many have college education going up through graduate 
work according to stone teaching was the first field stone said 
would be a good match particularly taking into account the need 
for minority educators more than 28 percent of the army is black 
including 11 percent of the officers according to stone 
stone also cited law enforcement and industrial fields that 
require expertise in maintenance electronics and transportation as 
areas that will find good employees in the pool of former soldiers 
although the agreement was officially signed tuesday publicity 
the project has received during the past several weeks has 
generated about 200 phone calls and letters from service personnel 
two recently retired captains one from the army and one from 
the navy have been hired as teachers by school districts

a judge wednesday threw out a civil racketeering 
lawsuit that claimed leona helmsley illegally took millions of 
dollars from her ailing real estate tycoon husband 
the complaint in manhattans federal court was filed last 
september by a former helmsley company executive who said mrs 
helmsleys actions had reduced the size of his commissions 
the suit had contended that mrs helmsley with the help of a 
former personal aide fraudulently transferred to her possession 
things like a 16 million apartment building a corporate jet and 
more than 90 million of bearer bonds 
the scheme was part of an effort to circumvent a prenuptial 
agreement between the helmsleys the suit claimed it said the 
transfers were accomplished by taking advantage of mr helmsleys 
declining mental facilities 
us district judge kenneth conboy ruled that the lawsuit had no 
standing under the civil racketeering law because the plaintiff 
william r miller was an indirect secondary victim of these 
alleged frauds 
miller was president of a helmsley real estate subsidiary brown 
harris stevens until april 
the suit claimed that miller lost out on commissions and bonuses 
from brown harris stevens because the alleged scheme deprived the 
company of profits 
miller also said mrs helmsley had charged him with theft and 
forced his resignation from the company 
calls to attorneys for mrs helmsley and miller were not 
immediately returned 
mrs helmsley 70 who is president of helmsley hotels was 
convicted in august 1989 of federal tax fraud charges and was 
sentenced to four years in prison and fined 71 million she is 
free pending her appeal 
her 81yearold husband harry also was charged in the criminal 
case but was found mentally incompetent to stand trial 
the civil lawsuit had named mrs helmsley several top helmsley 
executives and helmsley enterprises and 11 subsidiaries

killed in the crash of us military cargo plane in west germany 
military authorities said wednesday 
the crash early wednesday of the huge c5a transport was the 
first major accident in the nearly 3weekold roundtheclock 
deployment of us personnel and equipment to the gulf 
i dont want to speculate on the cause of this mishap said 
brig gen richard swope of the 316th air division we dont have 
any indication as to what the cause of the accident was 
four of the 17 people aboard the cargo plane were injured when 
the massive aircraft tumbled into a field early wednesday after 
taking off from ramstein air base a stopover for many us 
military flights bound for the gulf region 
the plane was bound for frankfurt carrying medical supplies 
food and aircraft maintenance equipment for us troops sent to 
saudi arabia following the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait us 
air force officials said 
late wednesday the air force released the names of the victims 
no hometowns were listed 
nine of those killed and one of those injured were reservists 
with the 433rd military airlift wing from kelly air force base in 
san antonio the four others were stationed at ramstein or at 
nearby hahn air base 
listed as dead from the 433rd were maj john m gordon pilot 
maj richard w chase pilot sgt rosendo herrera flight 
engineer sgt carpio villarreal flight engineer sgt daniel g 
perez loadmaster sgt edward e sheffield loadmaster maj

the plane was from the 60th military airlift squadron from 
travis air force base in california and was en route to rheinmein 
air base near frankfurt authorities said 
it left the ramstein air base at about 1230 am and clipped 
the tops of trees before crashing and breaking apart 
twisted chunks of wings landing gear fuselage and other debris 
were scattered over a wide area firefighters were still dousing 
smoldering sections of wreckage 12 hours after the crash 
the weather was hazy but visibility was about one mile said 
swope 
he said the aircraft was just over 20 years old which he said 
is not uncommon for the c5

parents and students may be prematurely 
slamming the door on college by inaccurately estimating costs and 
failing to tap all available sources of financial aid sen edward 
m kennedy said wednesday 
kennedy chairman of the senate labor and human resources 
committee commented on a general accounting office report that 
said a review of nine studies and a gao analysis found students in 
grades 10 through 12 knew little about federal financial aid 
generally the studies showed parents had little idea of about 
college costs most parents greatly overestimated costs or offered 
unrealistically low estimates ranging from a low of 2000 to a 
high of 60000 a year 
the college board said total available student aid in 198990 
amounted to 279 billion after adjusting for inflation total aid 
increased 10 percent over the 198081 level 
in 1980 only 12 percent of all high school sophomores thought 
the pell grant program was available in their schools and only 8 
percent believed stafford loans a governmentbacked program were 
available 
pell grants the largest aid program are available to all who 
qualify but a 1988 study by the council for advancement and 
support of education found 49 percent of the high school students 
polled incorrectly thought they were ineligible for aid to attend 
an expensive private school if their parents could afford a state 
school 
onethird of those polled also incorrectly believed financial 
aid is set aside solely for minority students and almost a quarter 
incorrectly believed that students with average grades dont 
qualify for financial aid 
the study found that more than half the high school graduates 
who didnt enroll in college cited affordability finances and the 
need to work as reasons 
a 1983 study by the pennsylvania association of colleges and 
universities found that 59 percent of ninth graders reported 
receiving no information about financial aid from their schools 
the gao report also found that high school students 
knowledgeable about financial aid were more likely to enroll in 
college than students less familiar with such aid 
it seems likely that lack of knowledge and misconceptions 
limit students and parents understanding of postsecondary 
options at worst such ignorance may lead to specific decisions 
about high school courses that close the doors on some future job 
and school possibilities the gao said

the khmer rouge and its two noncommunist 
guerrilla allies said wednesday they support a united nations plan 
to place cambodia under un control until a new government can be 
elected 
vietnam and the government it installed in cambodia have not 
responded to the proposal made tuesday by the five permanent 
members of the un security council talks on cambodia resume 
friday in new york between us and vietnamese diplomats 
analysts in bangkok thailand say the cambodian government 
wants to retain interim power and limit the un role to organizing 
elections 
on tuesday the five permanent members of the un security 
council the united states soviet union china britain and 
france announced a proposal calling for a ceasefire in cambodia 
and for the united nations then to supervise and control if 
necessary five key cambodian ministries defense foreign 
affairs finance public security and information 
it would be an unprecedented un operation to solve a regional 
conflict costing the united nations up to 5 billion over one or 
two years and involving as many as 10000 peacekeeping troops and 
10000 civilian personnel a us diplomat said 
we have gone as far as we can as the five permanent members 
said a us diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity the 
question is can the four cambodian factions agree 
he referred to the chinesebacked khmer rouge its two 
ussupported noncommunist guerrilla allies and the government 
in cambodia that gets funding from moscow 
it really comes down to how much influence the security 
council members can have on the factions suvit yodmani a 
spokesman for thai prime minister chatichai choonhavan said in 
bangkok wednesday the thai leader has been active in recent 
mediation efforts 
the cambodian factions are to meet in jakarta indonesia next 
month 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said that he 
hopes the cambodian parties will accept this framework so that we 
can move forward to a restoration of peace in cambodia 
the cambodian resistance groups announced their acceptance of 
the proposal in a statement released at the united nations 
all the parties of the cambodian national resistance 
including the democratic kampuchea party khmer rouge have 
repeatedly expressed their full support for the works of the five 
permanent members of the united nations security council and viewed 
that the documents successively adopted by them should constitute 
the framework of a comprehensive political settlement of the 
cambodian conflict it said 
the fundamental stumbling block which has undermined a 
political settlement of the cambodian problem is vietnams 
duplicity on the role of the united nations said the statement 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 to oust the khmer 
rouge blamed for the deaths of up to 1 million cambodians by 
executions and starvation after they took power in 1975

the fbi soon will fieldtest kits that enable 
police officers to wipe your palm and determine within minutes 
whether youve been handling drugs or explosives recently 
its a much less intrusive method of testing for drug use than 
the traditional urine test and does not require hours or days of 
work by laboratory technicians said dr dean fetterolf of the 
fbis forensic science research unit in quantico va 
fetterolf described the new test gear for drugs and explosives 
for a news conference at a meeting of the american chemical society 
the new test uses antibodies produced in laboratory animals to 
detect the presence of micrograms millionths of a gram of the 
target substance on skin desk tops or other surfaces the 
antibodies trigger a color change in an indicator chemical if the 
target is present 
the tests are calibrated so that they will not pick up the tiny 
but detectible amounts of cocaine on virtually all the 20 and 50 
bills in circulation fetterolf said 
antibodies are specific to the triggering substance and the test 
should not be triggered by other chemicals he said 
such false positives are a bane of many current tests some 
urine tests for example indicate drug use if the subject has 
eaten a lot of sesame seeds 
the first drug test kits 200 for cocaine and 200 for heroin 
should be delivered next month for fbi field tests and future kits 
might also be used for amphetamines and phenylcylidine pcp he 
said 
the drug kits are being developed under a 50000 contract by 
biometric systems inc of eden prairie minn a similar kit for 
certain explosives is being developed for 35000 by westinghouse 
corp of baltimore 
taking laboratory technology from a threehour analysis with a 
trained technician down to a 30second analysis that can be done by 
someone whos not trained as an expert in chemistry or science is 
not a trivial task fetterolf said 
a sample test kit displayed by fetterolf and other fbi agents 
consisted of three tiny tubes of liquids and a 
smallerthanamatchbook plastic container 
dr patrick guire biometrics vice president for research and 
development said the company is ahead of schedule and may even 
ship the kits early 
guire said the kits will be mass produced and sold either by 
hycor biomedical of garden grove calif with which his company 
has a licensing agreement for other antibody tests or by 
biometric itself 
fetterolf predicted each one would cost 7 to 8 but guire said 
he expected the cost to be about 5 once mass production begins 
the fbi soon will receive a prototype of the antibody test kit 
for explosives fetterolf said 
its very well documented in the scientific literature that 
someone who handles explosives and then picks up a briefcase 
will transfer the explosives from the outside of their hand to the 
briefcase he said 
the kits can detect tnt in traces as small as one part per 
billion and in the last few weeks an antibody has been developed 
for petn a major component of plastic explosives for as little as 
30 parts per trillion he said

onthejob lead poisoning is rampant in 
california two staterun studies reveal a medical journal 
editorial called the findings shocking and said they reflect a 
national scandal 
a third study yet unpublished estimated at least 2500 
california children under age 17 have potentially toxic levels of 
lead in their blood because they live near factories that use lead 
or in homes with leadbased paint 
the research by californias department of health services shows 
that you literally have thousands of people exposed to an agent 
thats been known to be toxic for centuries said dr kenneth 
kizer the departments director and coauthor of two of the 
studies 
we can now verify there are substantial numbers of people who 
are being poisoned kizer said during a phone interview from 
sacramento 
lead a toxic metal is widely used in battery manufacturing 
plants brass foundries construction radiator repair shops gun 
firing ranges and pottery and ceramics plants 
lead poisoning can cause anemia high blood pressure stomach 
upset constipation headaches infertility miscarriages possible 
nervous system and brain damage joint pain kidney damage 
convulsions and coma 
the two studies of adult workers were published in the august 
issue of the american journal of public health 
they demonstrate theres an epidemic of occupational lead 
poisoning in california said neil maizlish chief author of one 
of the studies and a state epidemiologist in berkeley 
these data combined with earlier research data from texas 
new york and new jersey collectively show there is an epidemic of 
occupational lead poisoning in the united states 
the editorial accompaning the studies said the continuing 
overexposure of american workers to lead and the persistent 
occurrence of occupational lead poisoning is a national scandal 
the editorials author dr philip landrigan of new yorks mount 
sinai medical center described the studies results as shocking 
and said onthejob lead poisoning is entirely preventable 
jerome smith executive director of the lead industries 
association in new york said he hadnt seen the studies and 
couldnt comment but he suggested california officials overstated 
the problem by considering lead a health threat at levels lower 
than the government standard 
landrigan called the standard too weak 
the studies blamed californias onthejob leadpoisoning 
problem on employers ignorance of lead exposure laws company 
doctors ignorance of how to recognize and treat lead poisoning 
and weak enforcement by overburdened state and federal occupational 
health agencies 
the first study found that as of 1987 only 26 percent of 
californias leadusing industries conducted legally required tests 
of airborne lead in the workplace while only 14 percent regularly 
tested lead levels in workers blood 
the second study and more recent statecollected data revealed 
that by the end of july even the relatively small number of tests 
that were conducted showed at least 5000 california workers have 
elevated potentially toxic blood lead levels onesixth of those 
workers had levels that can produce leadpoisoning symptoms 
maizlish said 
the two studies show there is a significant lead poisoning 
problem out there and that many if not most of the cases are going 
undetected said industrial hygienist jeffrey jones a study 
coauthor 
based on the studies maizlish said his department estimates 
205000 of the 230000 californians exposed to lead at work are 
employed by companies where airborne lead levels arent tested 
the bulk of the problem is in the momandpop operations 
kizer said 
the studies of onthejob lead exposure stemmed from a state law 
officials hoped would detect lead poisoning in children it took 
effect in 1987 and required medical laboratories to report to 
kizers agency the results of blood tests that found elevated lead 
levels in anyone tested 
ninetyfive percent of the early reports covered adult workers 
indicating doctors tested few children for lead exposure 
so the department conducted the third study by testing blood 
lead levels in children in oakland sacramento wilmington and 
compton neighborhoods that had homes with lead paint or were 
located near leadusing industries based on the findings the 
researchers estimated at least 2500 california children have 
potentially toxic blood lead levels 
the other studies found 81 percent of the employees with 
elevated blood lead levels worked in los angeles county the 
states manufacturing center and 44 percent were hispanic even 
though hispanics make up only 24 percent of californias population 
whoever is at the bottom at the socioeconomic ladder tends to 
do this kind of work jones explained

rikers island inmates on wednesday detailed a 
night of horror in which they said guards lined them up in a prison 
corridor and battered them with nightsticks splashing blood all 
over the hallway 
i got hit with a nightstick so hard they nearly tore my finger 
off said ronald king 30 showing his bandaged right hand to 
reporters touring the jail for the first time since the aug 14 
riot 
a state watchdog panel in albany backed up the prisoners 
wednesday ruling the officers used excessive force in the uprising 
correction officers used force that was far in excess of what 
was reasonable and necessary to establish control of inmates and 
defend themselves said william mcmahon chairman of the state 
commission on correction which oversees all local jails in the 
state 
the numbers of officers and inmates injured and the nature of 
their injuries are grossly disproportionate he said 
mcmahon said 144 inmates were injured including two or three 
requiring neurosurgery and others with defensive injuries like 
broken arms and rear skull damage 
eighteen guards also were injured 
correction officials also said wednesday that a shakeup in 
command followed the episode a new warden and deputy warden were 
brought in last week at rikers islands otis bantum correctional 
center where the confrontation occurred 
correction officers claimed they struck the inmates in 
selfdefense after the riot but the inmates shouting through 
glass partitions to reporters told a different story 
charges that inmates destroyed property were trumped up to 
explain the injuries the prisoners suffered members of the inmate 
council said 
inmates handed reporters copies of their infraction notices from 
that night forms filled out by officers detailing alleged inmate 
wrongdoing an inmate charged with smashing windows was subdued 
with batons body holds punches all parts of body one 
form said 
king said on the night of aug 14 he was standing with his 
hands on his head when a guard smashed him with the stick the 
inmates had been forced from their beds on an upper floor that 
night by tear gas and the officers he said 
i saw the aftermath the stitches the black eyes there was 
blood everywhere through the whole bottom corridor said william 
whitaker a member of the inmates council 
the council chairman victor lantey said there was a massive 
amount of blood in the corridors four members of the council met 
the reporters in the jail chapel 
it was horrible horrific brutal said lantey 50 who has 
been at rikers for 11 months i saw heads busted eyes swollen 
up ribs broken it was excessive 
the hallway was clean wednesday and freshly painted 
whitaker 35 said the first indication the inmates had of an 
impending assault was when guards began moving through the cells 
taking blankets and coats from them things they could use to 
absorb any blows 
the incident followed a settlement between the officers union 
and the city that ended a twoday blockade of the bridge leading to 
the jail a report of a riot came in as the deal was made public 
and guards quickly poured across the bridge and onto the island 
inmates however said they were only barricading themselves in 
because they anticipated violence after correction officers union 
head phil seelig announced a rule had been eliminated that 
restricted the circumstances under which a guard could use force 
city officials later said the rule was simplified not 
eliminated 
corrections commissioner allyn sielaff who took over the 
troubled city jail system in march said in albany that he could 
not comment on the allegations of brutality because the riot is 
under investigation by the city department of investigation 
theres an independent objective investigation going on 
which im thankful for said sielaff im not privy to the 
details of that investigation 
mcmahon said sielaffs ignorance about the incident disturbed 
him 
im very surprised mcmahon said after talking with sielaff 
i can see where hes coming from but hes facing some serious 
problems that he should be looking at he cant just sit back

a lawyer sued the national endowment for the 
arts on wednesday alleging that its 15000 grant for an artists 
controversial exhibition displayed open and notorious hostility 
toward religion and violated the constitution 
the lawsuit was filed against the nea and its chairman john e 
frohnmayer in us district court by the rutherford institute a 
nonprofit legal services organization on behalf of david fordyce 
fordyce a lawyer was described as a devout christian from 
los angeles 
the suit cited the neas grant last year for tongues of 
flame an exhibit of works by david wojnarowicz of new york that 
was organized by university galleries at illinois state university 
the fordyce suit alleged that the neasupported catalog for the 
wojnarowicz show includes an image depicting jesus christ as an 
intravenous drug user it said the catalogue also refers to roman 
catholic cardinal john oconnor of new york as a fat cannibal 
and the worlds most active liar about condoms and safer sex 
fordyce said nea support for the catalog conveys a message of 
hate and animosity toward institutionalized religion sponsored by 
the federal government in violation of the first amendments 
provision for separation of church and state 
he asked the court for a permanent injunction prohibiting the 
arts endowment from funding sponsoring and endorsing works which 
promote blasphemous and sacrilegious hate material 
the endowment an independent 171 million federal agency that 
underwrites a wide variety of artists and arts organizations had 
no immediate comment on the lawsuit 
the nea is embroiled in a controversy over art obscenity and 
freedom of expression stemming from allegations by religious 
fundamentalists and conservative lawmakers led by sen jesse helms 
rnc that it has subsidized obscene and sacrilegious works 
the endowment already is the target of two other federal 
lawsuits in new york and los angeles challenging frohnmayers 
requirement that grant recipients sign a pledge of compliance with 
a congressional ban on using federal funds for works that may be 
deemed obscene 
in a telephone interview from new york wojnarowicz lamented the 
neas awful track record in supporting works by minority 
artists including homosexuals and lesbians 
if this kind of heat comes from cult or extreme conservative 
religious groups over the few coins that finance minority 
expression then this country is in pretty bad shape he said 
barry blinderman the illinois gallery director accused the 
lawsuits sponsors of hypocrisy and angrily defended 
wojnarowiczs work against charges of sacrilege 
before these people condemn the nea they should remember that 
it was the socalled holy men who didnt accept christ and turned 
him in blinderman said jesus said judge not and i 
recommend that these people follow the precepts of the god they are 
proclaiming 
the tongues of flame exhibit opened at blindermans gallery 
earlier this year and is now appearing at the santa monica museum 
of art in california 
john w whitehead founder and president of the rutherford 
institute told a news conference here that the nea had 
unconstitutionally used taxpayers funds to engage in actions 
which are hostile toward religion and religious persons 
the government should not become the patron of hate art 
against some of its citizens whitehead said religious people 
must no longer be the personal targets of cannon fire from national 
endowment projects 
wojnarowicz previously had filed a federal lawsuit in new york 
against the rev donald wildmon and his conservative american 
family association 
in late june a new york federal judge ruled that wildmons 
group probably had misrepresented wojnarowiczs works by including 
fragments of them in a pamphlet titled your tax dollars helped 
pay for these works of art 
the judge said the pamphlets which were mailed to members of 
congress religious leaders and media outlets probably had damaged 
the artists reputation and the value of his works he issued an 
injunction forbidding further publication of the pamphlet

the massive deployment of us navy warships 
and support vessels to saudi arabia has been putting a strain 
on the service a senior navy official said on wednesday 
were strained at the level where we are well just have to 
operate that way for a while said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the official said that the deployments of some major warships 
such as the aircraft carrier uss eisenhower and its battle group 
have had to be extended for a time because of the crisis but the 
navy leadership is committed to getting its longabsent sailors 
back home as soon as possible 
the eisenhower and its guardian ships have been at sea since 
march and sixmonth deployments are about what people can 
endure away from home and family said the official 
four us carriers each bristling with dozens of warplanes 
have been deployed to middle east waters in response to iraqs 
invasion of kuwait 
the navy also has been moving some 45000 marines onto saudi 
soil and aboard amphibious assault ships near the arabian peninsula 
tens of thousands of soldiers have been flown into saudi arabia 
and the militarys fast sea lift ships have gotten the armys first 
heavy tanks in place in recent days to defend the saudi oil fields 
but some problems have arisen with meeting deadlines for 
transporting cargo with the ready reserve fleet the official 
acknowledged 
those ships are mothballed and only put into service in times of 
emergency so some snags and delays were expected to occur the 
official said 
the navys military sealift command provides ships to the other 
services for transport purposes 
there are 96 ships in the ready reserve fleet of the 41 ships 
requested for service about 27 werent ready for loading on time 
with delays ranging from one to 20 days pentagon officials said 
even so the military has been able to move an enormous amount 
of cargo in a very short time with little warning the navy 
official said 
weve moved more stuff in three weeks than we did in the first 
three months of the korean war the official said 
youre always going to have problems with sealift because 
when you have a conflict like this you have to use ships that have 
been tied up for some time the official said 
the massive transportation effort has played out about like i 
expected it to it wouldnt all be perfect but wed get the cargo 
moving and it is moving the official said

iraq has told the white house it would withdraw 
from kuwait and allow foreigners to leave if certain demands were 
met newsday reported wednesday 
in its secret offer iraq said it wants united nations sanctions 
lifted guaranteed access to the persian gulf and sole control of 
an oil field that dips into kuwait newsdays washington bureau 
reported 
the newspaper said an unidentified former highranking us 
official confirmed that he had delivered iraqs message to national 
security adviser brent scowcroft last thursday 
in washington a white house official confirmed wednesday that 
the message was delivered to scowcroft but said it was basically 
a nonstarter 
our position has always been that iraq must withdraw from 
kuwait anything that seeks to circumvent the un resolve does not 
provide great optimism for movement he said commenting only on 
condition of anonymity 
white house deputy press secretary roman popadiuk refused to 
confirm or deny the existence of the message but said were aware 
of many initiatives that are being undertaken by various bodies 
he said it would be selfdefeating to start singling out one 
proposal or one putative proposal or initiative at the expense of 
others he said the main point is that the united nations has 
spoken as one voice in demanding that iraq pull its troops out 
of kuwait 
in baghdad iraqs official news agencey said no such proposal 
was made 
newsday said that the former official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said he was unsure whether the proposal was a serious 
offer or floating something to see whether youre going to bite 
or not 
however newsday quoted an unidentified administration official 
who specializes in mideast affairs as saying that the proposal was 
serious and that the package was negotiable 
that official said it was significant that iraq made no mention 
in its proposal of a precondition that the united states pull its 
troops out of saudi arabia 
the official said earlier iraqi proposals had contained what he 
described as impossible demands such as linking a pullout from 
kuwait with an israeli withdrawal from the occupied west bank and 
gaza 
newsday said an unidentified white house spokesman when asked 
to comment reaffirmed president george bushs stated precondition 
that iraq pull out of kuwait allow the restoration of its 
government and release all hostages before any negotiations begin

censorship attempts ranging from book bannings 
to protests of aids education made 198990 the worst year on record 
for academic freedom in the public schools an advocacy group said 
wednesday 
people for the american way a liberal organization that focuses 
on constitutional liberty issues said it documented 244 attacks on 
freedom to learn up from 172 incidents it cited in 198889 
this years total was the highest since the group began its 
annual survey in 1982 but it probably represents only a fraction 
of all the incidents that occurred the report said 
the censorship movement in america is flourishing said 
arthur j kropp president of people for the american way 
from novels to television programs to fine art to music to 
movies to textbooks we are witnessing an explosion of censorship 
an explosion sparked by the match of far right and religious right 
intolerance kropp said 
but the report also said only about onethird of the censorship 
attempts succeeded this year while the others were rejected by 
principals school boards or other officials 
in 198889 about 50 percent of the attempts succeeded 
thirtynine states had at least one documented incident but 114 
of the incidents 46 percent occurred in the west 
california led with 70 oregon was second with 16 followed by 
washington and new york with 14 each michigan with 13 and florida 
and texas with 12 each 
the report attributed californias total to activities by 
rightwing religious groups waging a campaign to change 
stateapproved curricula and reading lists 
those groups have focused on impressions a reading series for 
kindergarten through sixth grade published by a subsidiary of 
harcourt brace jovanovich inc 
the series features stories poems and literary excerpts 
including writings by martin luther king jr cs lewis and laura 
ingalls wilder there also are fantasy stories some dealing with 
witches and goblins 
educators have praised impressions but critics say the books 
promote satanism witchcraft and rebellion against parents and 
other authority figures kropp said others describe the material 
as violent and depressing 
many of the california incidents in the people for the american 
way report involve impressions the series was removed from 
classrooms in coeur dalene idaho an attempt to ban the books in 
redondo beach calif failed a court battle is under way in 
dixon calif 
the rev louis p sheldon chairman of traditional values 
coalition of anaheim calif which opposes the series said it 
contains some good literature but some of the writings promote a 
new age religion he said 
it has stories and characters that demean and denigrate 
traditional values and beliefs sheldon said 
harcourt brace jovanovich said in a statement we are not 
going to be intimidated by selfappointed guardians of local 
reading standards 
the impressions series provides instructional experiences that 
build and strengthen reading ability while allowing students to 
experience overall enjoyment and excitement in reading the 
company said 
meanwhile efforts continued from florida to colorado to require 
that textbooks give the biblical account of creation and downplay 
evolution people for the american way said 
book bannings were sought across the nation for use of offensive 
words the report said among works critics sought to be removed 
from school libraries and classroom reading lists were mark twains 
the adventures of huckleberry finn maya angelous i know why 
the caged bird sings and shakespeares romeo and juliet 
sex education and aids instruction were attacked in alabama new 
york and south carolina the report said 
in several texas communities students were prohibited from 
wearing jewelry clothing or symbols thought to be associated with 
satanism

motorists in 27 states will face sobriety 
checkpoints during the labor day weekend a private group said 
wednesday after it surveyed authorities nationwide 
the setting up of roadside checkpoints follows a supreme court 
ruling in february that allowed random checks for drunken drivers 
the american alliance for rights and responsibilities a new 
group that supports the idea of checkpoints said it contacted 
public safety officials in every state by telephone the 
organization had written all governors urging a start of the 
program this weekend 
the 20 states without plans for sobriety checks said they would 
step up patrols to catch drunken drivers during the weekend said 
roger conner alliance president three states hawaii iowa and 
nebraska failed to respond to the survey he said 
four states louisiana michigan oregon and vermont have 
ongoing litigation or court rulings based on state constitutions 
that prohibit checkpoints conner said 
police checking motorists for drunkenness generally have to 
delay a driver for only about 90 seconds he said 
the court ruled that the minimal intrusion for lawabiding 
motorists is outweighed by the benefit of preventing drunken 
driving alcohol figured in about half of the 46000 traffic 
fatalities last year 
of the 27 states which said they would set up the checkpoints 
24 said the programs are the result of both state and local law 
enforcement efforts the survey said in three states 
connecticut georgia and north carolina the programs reportedly 
were set up only by some local police agencies 
states planning the checkpoints statewide according to the 
survey include arizona california colorado delaware illinois 
indiana kansas kentucky massachusetts maryland maine 
missouri mississippi montana new jersey new mexico nevada new 
york ohio pennsylvania south carolina south dakota virginia

california the main source of us 
pistachios is producing a record crop of the nuts this year the 
agriculture department said wednesday 
production was estimated at 115 million pounds an inshell 
weight almost triple last years harvest and 22 percent more than 
the previous record of 94 million pounds in 1988 
the large increase is primarily due to the alternate bearing 
cycle of the pistachio crop the report said bearing acreage 
also increased 6 percent from 1989 to 51500 acres 
an alternate bearing cycle means large production one year and a 
smaller harvest the next

the historic hotel barre was destroyed by a 
suspicious fire wednesday two days after the 101yearold inn 
recently restored to its victorian elegance was ordered closed by 
a bankruptcy court 
a business tragedy has become a human tragedy said david m 
nickless a fitchburg lawyer who was appointed trustee for the 
property monday the town has lost something that it had put its 
whole heart and soul into the restoration of the hotel had become 
the rebirth of the town 
the state fire marshals office was investigating the blaze and 
nickless said he would ask federal officials to join the inquiry 
fire chief raymond howard termed the fire suspicious and said the 
building was supposed to have been empty 
the stately threestory hotel on the town common was engulfed in 
flames when firefighters arrived said howard 
more than 100 firefighters from 10 towns battled the blaze 
which lit the night sky for miles in central massachusetts 
northwest of worcester 
by 7 am scores of stunned residents began gathering on the 
common to watch as firefighters worked on the smoldering ruin 
this is a horrible loss to barre said state rep steven 
brewer a barre resident the town will never be the same 
the hotel brought people from all over the world to barre 
said selectman duk demetroupoulos 
built in 1899 in a style that suggested a mississippi river 
steamboat the inn had 36 guest rooms 11 fireplaces and an elegant 
dining room decorated with murals guests had included presidents 
theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson and calvin coolidge 
it was purchased in 1985 for 265000 by the kenneth and nancy 
lee wright and douglas merrifield who recreated its lavish 
victorian atmosphere before its shutdown the hotel had 68 full 
and parttime workers 
wright who had managed the hotel declined to comment on the 
fire 
the owners sought chapter 11 bankruptcy law protection in 
february 1989 citing assets of 2 million and liabilities of 18 
million on monday a federal bankruptcy court judge ordered the 
liquidation of the hotel at the request of its largest creditor 
the worcester county institution for savings 
nickless said the hotel was covered by an 800000 insurance 
policy 
it had been listed for sale in 1987 with an asking price of 26 
million unfurnished or 36 million furnished

farm income prospects have brightened 
significantly despite rising energy costs prompted by the mideast 
crisis an agriculture department report showed wednesday 
the iraq situation pushed the price of crude oil up sharply 
the report said if a price increase of 10 a barrel is 
maintained for the remainder of the year agricultural fuel 
expenses in 1990 will be 10 percent higher than in 1989 
earlier the departments economic research service had forecast 
a 5 percent increase in 1990 fuel costs 
but the report also showed that net cash income of farmers 
this year is expected to be record high in the range of 59 
billion to 63 billion up about onetenth from 1989 the previous 
high was 572 billion in 1988 
the forecast for net cash income had been in the range of 55 
billion to 59 billion in recent months 
as used by the agency net cash income measures the value of 
commodities sold in a calendar year plus government payments less 
outofpocket costs some commodities sold actually may have been 
produced in earlier years and stored until marketed 
in another method of accounting the report said net farm 
income may be in the range of 47 billion to 52 billion 
compared with the previous forecast of 47 billion to 51 billion 
last years was about 47 billion a downward revision of 2 
billion from previous 1989 estimates 
net farm income is used to measure the value of agricultural 
production whether sold or stored in a calendar year plus 
government payments minus all costs including depreciation and 
other allowances 
the report said 1990 cash receipts for crops and livestock are 
expected to climb 6 percent to 8 percent from last year direct 
government payments are down somewhat from 1989 however 
cash expenses were forecast to be up 1 percent to 3 percent from 
1989 those include higher costs of fuels marketing storage 
transportation and farm rents 
overall the report said the 1990 balance sheet reflects a 
strong position for us agriculture with rising asset values 
mostly land and steady debt 
the rise in energy prices will have negligible effect this year 
on the farm cost of fertilizer and other chemicals but will 
probably be more pronounced in 1991 because most application is in 
the spring 
analysts said the performance of the general economy will be 
strongly influenced by how long the middle east crisis continues 
and how high oil prices climb 
current conditions point to dampening demand slower growth 
and higher inflation a situation that would be aggravated by 
extended oil price hikes the report said

sailors and pilots the uss lexington will be decomissioned in 
mid1991 the navy announced wednesday 
the uss forrestal which is homeported in mayport fla has 
been named to replace the lexington as the services training

a series of murders near the campus of a 
florida university shows americans have been too slow to recognize 
a plague of violence against women sen joseph r biden jr said 
wednesday 
it should not take such a grizzly and horrifying incident for 
us to act said biden chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee we already know that young women are 
disproportionately victimized by violent crime 
he said the five slayings discovered in recent days near the 
university of florida in gainesville dramatize just how 
vulnerable americas young women are as they return to campus 
four of the florida victims were women 
the comments came at the start of a judiciary committee hearing 
at which two women pleaded for congressional action to combat what 
they said was a spreading problem of acquaintance rape 
philadelphia paralegal christine shunk 25 told the committee 
that she was raped twice the first time when she was a college 
freshman and being escorted home from a fraternity party by a man 
she believed to be a friend two years later she was raped at 
knifepoint by a stranger 
i have already been raped twice and i have survived she 
said i do not know how i would survive a third assault mentally 
you see being raped is like having your whole world turned upside 
down 
the committee released results of a study done on behalf of the 
american psychological association that said the chances of any 
woman being raped in her lifetime were one in five it said the 
odds of being raped by an acquaintance were one in six 
we are here to debunk the myth that real rape only happens 
when a man jumps out of the bushes and attacks an unsuspecting 
victim said biden ddel in fact rape by someone the victim 
knows usually referred to as acquaintance rape is real rape and 
it is far more common and may be even more devastating to its 
survivors 
biden said support is growing for legislation that would direct 
more federal resources to combatting violence against women 
ms shunk of coatesville pa said she was plagued by guilt 
after the first attack because she had agreed to accompany the 
young man to his dorm room to pick up his jacket before he took her 
home 
in the first case ms shunk said she didnt realize at first 
that shed been raped a counselor she consulted didnt ask the 
name of her assailant but merely advised her to keep her grades up 
so that she could transfer to another school 
nicole snow 21 of new canaan conn told the committee that 
the summer before her junior year in high school she was raped by a 
boyfriend she at first thought was my dream 
i thought he was a popular caring wonderful football player 
and he seemed crazy about me she said my dream was quickly 
shattered a month after our first date he changed my life 
forever by brutally raping me 
she said that afterward she pretended it hadnt happened 
i continued my life robotically striving socially 
academically and athletically but inside there was a crying young 
girl she said it took three and a half years until i got the 
courage to seek therapy

the government on wednesday ordered an appeals 
court to reopen the cases of six irishmen convicted of murdering 21 
people in a pair of ira pub bombings in 1974 saying police may 
have tampered with evidence 
though doubts were raised only about evidence against one 
defendant home secretary david waddington ordered the court of 
appeal to review all six cases 
it is good news but im keeping my feet firmly on the 
ground said hugh callaghan one of the socalled birmingham six 
who have maintained their innocence for 16 years 
their convictions were affirmed by the court of appeal in 1988 
the explosions in two pubs in birmingham on nov 21 1974 were 
the deadliest attack ever mounted in england by the outlawed irish 
republican army in its campaign against british rule in northern 
ireland the explosions killed 21 people and injured 162 
scientific tests of police notes of an interview with convict 
richard mcilkenny indicated that some pages were written at 
different times the home office said 
waddington said the interview with mcilkenny implicated one 
other defendant but fairness required a review of all six cases 
its very very difficult to disentangle the significance of 
evidence like this for the case of one defendant as compared with 
its significance for the case of the other defendants waddington 
said in an interview with bbc radio 
chris mullin a member of parliament who wrote a book arguing 
the innocence of the six said it was likely that much additional 
new evidence would be presented to the court 
for the first time i detect that there is a will on the part 
of many of those in authority to bring this great scandal to an end 
once and for all said mullin a member of the opposition labor 
party its casting a blight upon our whole legal system not only 
at home but around the world 
irish prime minister charles haughey said the new appeal was 
very good news relations between britain and ireland have been 
strained by the birmingham six case and others in britain involving 
ira suspects 
five of the six men were arrested a few hours after the 
bombings as they were about to board a ferry to belfast northern 
ireland for the funeral of an ira member 
mcilkenny callaghan johnny walker patrick hill gerry hunter 
and billy power were convicted of murder in 1975 and sentenced to 
life in prison 
they were refused the right to appeal in 1976 and failed in a 
1977 lawsuit alleging that they were assaulted by investigating 
officers a decade later the government acknowledged doubts about 
their convictions by referring the case to the court of appeal 
which affirmed the convictions 
the birmingham six case is the last of three major trials of 
suspected ira guerrillas from the 1970s to be returned to the 
appellate courts following vigorous public campaigns proclaiming 
the defendants innocence 
three men and a woman convicted of killing six people in 
bombings in guildford and woolwich in 1975 were freed by the court 
of appeal in october six other people convicted in a related case 
of operating an ira bomb factory are awaiting an appeal hearing 
after waddington announced in june that the convictions were 
unsafe 
in march waddington asked the devon and cornwall constabulary 
to investigate certain undisclosed points raised by attorneys for 
the birmingham six 
devon and cornwall police conducted electrostatic deposition 
tests on records of the west midlands police force whose 
detectives investigated the birmingham bombings the test can 
determine when a document was written and whether any alterations 
have been made to it 
a year ago west midlands chief constable geoffrey dear 
suspended two detectives and reassigned 53 members of the serious 
crime squad after the tests indicated that records had been 
falsified in cases going back to 1986 
supporters of the birmingham six argue that their confessions 
were contradictory that police tampered with logs to make 
statements appear consistent that forensic evidence was flawed and 
that no witness testified to seeing any of the men in the two pubs

washingtonarea tv stations may have to offer 
equal time to political opponents of jesse jackson if the stations 
show him conducting interviews in the middle east a federal 
official said wednesday 
jackson hopes to interview iraqi president saddam hussein along 
with american hostages this week for the syndicated tv series 
inside edition which is broadcast on the local nbcowned tv 
station 
jackson is running in the district of columbia for a shadow 
seat in the us senate an unpaid lobbyist post for dc 
statehood he reportedly is being paid about 125000 to work as a 
journalist although officials at king world productions which 
syndicates inside edition have said theyre only picking up 
jacksons expenses 
news programs can claim exemption from federal equal opportunity 
commonly known as equal time rules if candidates are the 
subjects of bona fide newscasts documentaries or other types of 
legitimate news events 
but because jackson will be an interviewer and not an 
interviewee a station probably could not claim such an exemption 
said milton gross chief of the federal communications commissions 
fairnesspolitical programming branch 
gross said he gave such an opinion informally to someone who 
called him on behalf of the nbcowned station in washington 
wrctv which broadcasts inside edition he would not identify 
the caller 
the subject of the news would be exempt but not the 
interviewer gross said 
he added that inside edition had not sought an equal time 
exemption as a news program as have some other shows such as 
hard copy and entertainment tonight 
gross based his opinion on a supreme court ruling involving a 
california newscaster who also was a political candidate the 
newscaster had argued that the equal time rules were depriving him 
of his livelihood but the court said station employees could not 
claim the exemption gross said 
jacksons appearance on inside edition would not be exempt 
if the supreme courts decision were applicable gross said 
the fcc official said he did not know if the equal time rules 
would apply to a washington station that used portions of jacksons 
inside edition appearance on its regularly scheduled news 
programs 
he said he could give a definitive ruling only if a jackson 
opponent demanded equal time and a station refused 
wrctv vice presidentgeneral manager allan horlick said he felt 
his station could broadcast jacksons interview without being 
subject to any equal time claim 
we anticipate certainly broadcasting the show and we will be 
in full compliance with anything coincidental to the fact he is 
running for a shadow senate position horlick said 
jackson also has a new syndicated program the jesse jackson 
show due to debut next month nationwide but it will be blacked 
out in the washington area until after the november election

a photo taken by the hubble space telescope 
shows a galaxy seen only as fuzzy ball by telescopes on earth is 
actually so tightly packed with stars that it may harbor a black 
hole at its center nasa said wednesday 
the picture which an official said was taken to prove to the 
public that the hubble is not broken shows a galaxy 400 times 
more tightly packed with stars than the suns own milky way galaxy 
scientists said the hubble photo captured more detail of the 
galaxy than is possible by earthbound telescopes and was thus able 
to determine that the stellar group had many more stars than 
expected 
the picture was taken by the wide fieldplanetary camera on 
hubble one of the instruments officials said was seriously 
affected by a focusing flaw manufactured into the telescope but not 
discovered until after it was launched 
officials also released a photo taken with another hubble camera 
that shows a ring of matter encircling a supernova a star that 
exploded in the southern sky in 1987 the ring of material had not 
been spotted before by telescopes on earth 
tod r lauer an astronomer with the national optical astronomy 
observatories said the compact galaxy of stars discovered by the 
hubble is vastly denser than we expected this galaxy to be 
he said groundbased photos of the galaxy showed a smooth blob 
of light and gave no suggestion that it contained so many stars 
weve never been able to study any galaxy outside of our local 
group two dozen galaxies near the milky way at this resolution 
before lauer said 
the galaxy called ngc7457 is 40 million light years away and 
contains about 30000 stars within an area of only about nine light 
years 
hubble chief scientist ed weiler said that one explanation for 
such a dense galaxy would be the presence of a black hole 
were not claiming that this is a black hole he said at a 
news conference it is not inconsistent with a black hole 
however 
astronomy theory holds that a black hole can be formed when 
stellar matter collects in such a mass of such density and of such 
a high gravitational force that even light cannot escape 
there have been no confirmed black holes found in the universe 
but weiler said that if one existed it might take on the appearance 
of the galaxy photographed by the hubble 
weiler said the galaxy will be further studied by hubble 
instruments to determine if it does contain a black hole 
the other photo released showed a glowing ring encircling 
supernova 1987a an exploded star 160000 light years from earth 
the picture was taken by hubbles faint object camera an 
instrument made the european space agency for the space telescope 
nino panagia a esa scientist said the photo shows that matter 
ejected from the star years before its explosion was compacted and 
then set aglow by the burst of light when the star blew up he said 
the ring will be blow apart within a few years when the blast wave 
from the exploding collides with the material in the ring 
nasa took the pictures as part of a campaign to demonstrate that 
the hubble is a valuable telescope even though it has flawed optics 
eric chaisson educational director of the space telescope 
science institute in baltimore said he wrote memos in recent weeks 
calling for a campaign to change the perception of the public and 
of the science community about the problems with hubble 
in a memo obtained by the san jose calif mercury news 
chaisson said action should be taken to change the public image of 
the 16 billion observatory 
unless a dramatic campaign is mounted to share with the 
american public the technical truth with a positive spin 
chaisson wrote then we should prepare ourselves for an endless 
stream of newspaper cartoons latenight tv talkshow jokes and 
blistering postmortems by columnists the world over 
he added we shall continue to see an erosion of public 
support for nasas ambitious space program 
reached by telephone chaisson confirmed that he had written 
such a memo noting that the pictures of the galaxy and supernova 
were taken in part because of his efforts 
we needed some science to prove to the public that hubble is 
not broken he said i dont apologize for it what i was 
trying to do with the memo was to jerk the system around so it 
would do a little science 
since hubble has been launched it has been in a shakedown 
operation designed to test it capabilities since the focusing flaw 
was found engineers have been operating the hubble to find out the 
precise nature of the malfunction 
chaisson said his memo helped persuade nasa to interrupt the 
engineering checkout and take some pictures of scientific value

president mikhail s gorbachev chewed out five top 
officials on wednesday for the cigarette shortage that has led to 
street protests across the nation and rationing in moscow 
the discussion showed that managing officials acted 
irresponsibly neglected their duties and have not taken necessary 
measures to resolve the problem concerning millions of people 
tass reported 
the official soviet news agency said gorbachev demanded an 
explanation of the tobacco shortage from the officials and found 
their responses unconvincing and unsound 
the meeting came one day after the moscow city council voted to 
begin cigarette rationing at just five packs a month per person 
starting saturday authorities have also announced price increases 
that will triple the official cost of most cigarette brands 
starting next month 
the tobacco shortage which has lasted all summer has forced 
soviet smokers to spend hours waiting in lines at kiosks to buy 
cigarettes 
hundreds of irate nicotine addicts have rallied in moscow 
leningrad gorky and other cities and young people demanding more 
cigarettes alcohol and food rioted in the siberian city of 
chelyabinsk 
the officials summoned by gorbachev to provide explanations for 
the shortage were soviet first deputy prime ministers vladilen 
nikitin and lev voronin russian republic prime minister ivan 
silayev russian republic first deputy prime minister gennady kulik 
and deputy minister of trade suren sarukhanov 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkov also attended the session tass 
said but he apparently did not suffer gorbachevs wrath 
official spokesmen have blamed the shortage on factory 
breakdowns hoarding by black marketeers and the neardepletion of 
the nations reserves of foreign currency which has led to reduced 
cigarette imports from bulgaria

the flow of americans to california has pushed 
the golden state far ahead of all rivals in population and will 
give it a record 52 seats in the 1992 house of representatives new 
census figures indicate 
preliminary 1990 population figures show california picking up 
seven house seats followed by florida with four texas three and a 
handful of other warmweather states with one each 
new york hung on to its no 2 ranking in population behind 
california in the new figures with texas and florida closing fast 
in third and fourth places but will lose three seats in congress 
because its population rose only slightly in the 1980s 
four northern industrial states illinois michigan ohio and 
pennsylvania lost population during the decade and will have two 
fewer seats each 
the census bureau estimated a national count of just under 246 
million including 293 million in california 176 million in new 
york 168 million in texas and 128 million in florida wyoming 
was last at just under 450000 passed by alaska which had the 
smallest population in 1980 but grew to almost 546000 in 1990 
the total population count in 1980 was 226545805 
house seats are redistributed among the states after each 
census because the number is limited to 435 seats when a growing 
state gains a seat some other state must lose one 
new yorks slight population gain was quickly disputed by state 
officials who had predicted repeatedly that the state would be 
undercounted 
i dont believe it gov mario cuomo said in albany do 
you really honestly believe that everybody who should be counted 
has been counted the answer is of course not my mother had 
trouble she didnt want to answer 
new york mayor david n dinkins called the citys estimated 
slight decline unadulterated nonsense and promised to pinpoint 
where he said the government had made errors 
overall 19 house seats will change states according to the 
figures which could change significantly before the final report 
is issued dec 31 
the widely noted movement of americans to the sun belt was 
documented anew in the census bureau figures besides california 
florida and texas states gaining a house seat each were arizona 
georgia north carolina virginia and washington 
besides the twoseat losers illinois michigan ohio and 
pennsylvania there will be one less seat each for iowa kansas 
kentucky louisiana massachusetts montana new jersey and west 
virginia 
overall the preliminary census figures show the united states 
with a population of 245837683 residents thats somewhat below 
the 250 million that the bureau had estimated earlier this year 
however 4 million or more may be added as the census bureau 
conducts follow up counts and completes tabulations before the 
final reports are made public if those are added in only a few 
states some of the seats allocated in the preliminary tally could 
shift again 
for example a study by the private firm election data services 
showed kentucky and mississippi neck and neck for the last seat 
allocated mississippi got the seat but a shift of 3000 people 
could shift it to kentucky 
kimball brace head of eds stressed that the figures are 
subject to change 
in addition to changes made after local officials assess the 
preliminary figures there is a chance that the final report could 
be adjusted next summer 
the bureau has been criticized for undercounting minorities in 
the past and is conducting a postcensus check on its count this 
time if officials determine that some group has been missed a 
decision could be made to statistically adjust the final numbers 
that ruling will be made by the department of commerce in 
midjuly 1991 
the national total was completed wednesday with the reports for 
the final four states new york texas illinois and pennsylvania 
census officials emphasize that the figures are provided to 
allow local governments to question the results in the event people 
were missed or overcounted

president mikhail s gorbachev met with his chief 
rival boris n yeltsin for several hours on wednesday and they 
discussed their nations crumbling economy and relations with 
japan a spokesman said 
the meeting was the first between the two since they clashed 
earlier this month over the attempt by russia the soviet unions 
largest republic to seize control over its vast natural resources 
from the central soviet government 
yeltsin is president of the russian republic gorbachev issued a 
presidential decree last week nullifying the russian move 
this was a very good and a very constructive discussion 
said gorbachevs new spokesman vitaly ignatenko 
ignatenko said the two talked about matters relating to russia 
the entire soviet union and international topics including europe 
and relations with japan 
he provided few details on the discussion but he said the 
soviet economy was a central theme 
the situation in the country is such that we are on the 
threshold of major decisions ignatenko said we have 
approached such a decisive stage when we are speaking about a real 
change in economic structures and new relationships within the 
union itself 
old structures are becoming a thing of the past but the new 
structures are still emerging this gives rise to a certain 
instability to heated discussions and this situation cannot easily 
be kept under control 
gorbachev and yeltsin have jointly appointed a commission to 
study making the transition to a market economy another 
commission led by soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov is also 
drafting plans for the economic switch 
gorbachev favors a gradual approach to avoid the shock of sudden 
price increases yeltsin wants to make the transition quickly 
arguing that the ailing economy needs urgent measures 
yeltsin has accused ryzhkov of duplicating his work and said if 
more than one plan were presented to the national parliament the 
russian republic would go its own way 
ignatenko said gorbachev would convene a joint meeting of his 
presidential council and the council of the federation on thursday 
gorbachev has invited yeltsin and other leaders of the soviet 
republics and autonomous regions to attend 
this meeting also will focus on the economy and the unrest in 
the republics ignatenko said 
today our leadership is expressing only one wish to stabilize 
the situation to protect the new economic policy by exercising its 
powers to defend perestroika he said the coming few months 
should be decisive in many ways 
i hope that this political line will be protected 
ignatenko whose appointment was announced tuesday told a room 
crowded with journalists that he planned to hold weekly news 
conferences

lockheed corps contender in the 
competition to see which defense contractor will build the nations 
21st century fighter jet was unveiled wednesday a fiercelooking 
twintailed stubbywinged craft 
air force generals at the ceremony said the middle east crisis 
demonstrates the need for such a plane 
lockheeds yf22 prototype of the advanced tactical fighter was 
rolled out at its palmdale manufacturing plant to the strains of 
wagners the ride of the valkyries in the background 
this is a great day for the evolution of tactical aircraft 
said lockheed chairman daniel m tellep 
lockheeds plane will compete against a northrop model yf23 
which was rolled out and taken for a test flight monday 
lockheed teamed with the boeing corp and general dynamics to 
build the yf22 northrop teamed with mcdonnell douglas to build 
its prototype 
both planes have smooth contours to reduce their radar 
reflections and are built of advanced composite materials 
the pentagon wants a fighter plane that can fly twice the speed 
of sound without using fuelguzzling afterburners but it must also 
be highly maneuverable for dogfights with other planes and use 
radarevading stealth technology 
the lockheed plane resembles the navys fa18 hornet 
fighterattack aircraft with stubby wings 
the northrop plane is longer with a cigarlike fuselage and a 
wingspan that from overhead looks like a kite 
the lockheed yf22 stayed on the ground after its rollout 
ceremony and officials refused to say when it would be flown 
tellep said it doesnt matter that northrop got its aircraft up 
first 
it is not he who flies first it is he who flies best he 
said 
the atf program faced fading prospects for approval in congress 
before iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 but the crisis has 
enhanced prospects for approval of major defense projects 
the contract calls for 750 fighter planes for the air force and 
approximately 500 for the navy at a cost of 51 million apiece the 
price tag is about twice the cost of the f15 eagle the current 
frontline fighter deployed in the middle east 
the f15 will have been in service nearly 30 years when the 
first atfs enter military service in the year 2002 
air force gen ronald w yates jr recalled the munich crisis of 
1938 in which adolf hitlers military might forced appeasement by 
britains prime minister neville chamberlain he compared it to 
todays standoff with iraqs saddam hussein 
the difference is the support of a strong military armed with 
the most advanced weaponry said yates commander of the air force 
systems command at wrightpatterson air force base near dayton 
ohio 
air force maj gen joseph w ralston said he is optimistic 
about congressional funding for the atf program in spite of recent 
defense spending cuts

seven perjury charges were filed wednesday against 
suspended police chief mack vines as a result of an investigation 
into his testimony to a special panel that looked into the shooting 
of a civilian by an officer 
its sufficient to note that we found in that investigation 
seven separate counts of aggravated perjury said district 
attorney john vance i think the chief made two appearances 
before the panel but we cant go into what is alleged in each of 
those because that is still pending before the grand jury 
vance said the charges would be presented to the grand jury on 
sept 10 a thirddegree felony carries a maximum 10year prison 
term and fines of up to 10000 
city manager jan hart said vines 51 would remain on 
indefinite suspension and named a new acting chief 
vines attorney kim wade was not speaking with the media 
a woman who answered the phone at wades office said wednesday 
vines in the past has denied wrongdoing and has refused to resign 
some city council members said the charges alone are enough to 
cost vines the job he has held since july 1988 during his tenure 
vines has angered some veteran officers while winning the support 
of some leaders of minority groups i think it would be nearly 
impossible for chief vines to lead this police department with the 
confidence of the city into the future humpty dumpty is broken and 
i dont think theres any reasonable way of putting that all 
together again said councilman jerry bartos 
dallas police association president monica smith who has been 
critical of vines in the past said she believed vines is 
entitled to and will receive a fair review of the facts presented 
to the grand jury by the district attorneys office 
the developments stem from the fatal shooting last year of an 
unarmed mexican national by officer patrick lemaire vines fired 
lemaire 17 days after the killing 
lemaire was reinstated last month by an administrative law judge 
who said vines failed to justify the firing during the 
administrative hearing an internal affairs detective testified 
that his initial report on the shooting was altered 
that led the city manager to appoint a threemember panel to 
look into the internal affairs officers allegations and the speed 
with which lemaire was fired 
ms hart suspended vines and assistant chief greg holliday with 
pay on aug 3 after holliday told her vines had called him at home 
and tried to persuade him to deemphasize in his testimony the 
speed of vines firing of lemaire 
ms hart asked vance to investigate the charges 
the panel decided the haste created a frenzied atmosphere 
conducive to mistakes and said that cast suspicion on lemaires 
suspension 
vance said holliday was helpful in the investigation and ms 
hart said there is no indication that chief holliday was not 
truthful to the panel she lifted his suspension wednesday and 
said he would return to work immediately

rescuers on wednesday started hauling 
to the surface the bodies of 150 miners killed in the countrys 
worst mining accident officials said the death toll could 
eventually reach 180 
mining inspectors said too many miners were allowed in the kreka 
coal mine shaft at the time of sundays blast although they did 
not say how many miners should have been allowed 
inspectors also said mine officials broke regulations by 
allowing relatives of the miners to work in the mine without being 
officially assigned there the mine is located 90 miles west of 
belgrade 
rescuers in recent days found the bodies of 150 miners and 
started bringing them up early wednesday with a conveyor system 
repaired after the blast according to bosko zelic a member of the 
mines managing board 
rescue teams working in roundtheclock shifts were still trying 
to clear away rubble blocking access to remote parts of the 
ninemile maze of underground corridors officials said they also 
were striving to ventilate all corridors to eliminate the 
possibility of a new explosion 
the management issued an updated casualty list with the names of 
180 miners instead of the 170 previously thought to have been 
working underground at the time of the explosion 
the blast is thought to have been caused by a buildup of coal 
dust or methane gas an investigation is under way 
officials said a funeral ceremony will be held on the main 
square of the nearby town of tuzla once the bodies of all victims 
are recovered 
yugoslavias worst previous mining disaster occurred in 1965 
when 128 miners were killed in a mine explosion in bosnia 
ninety miners were killed in an explosion at a coal mine south 
of belgrade in november

chancellor helmut kohls government 
said wednesday the two germanys will likely sign within two days a 
treaty providing the formal basis for unification although 
differences remain over abortion 
in east germany an estimated 90000 public employees in at 
least 20 cities held a second day of warning strikes over fears 
their jobs will be endangered by unification with west germany 
about 10000 nurses garbagemen bus drivers and others stopped 
working for two hours in east berlin 
strikes of up to two hours were also reported in erfurt 
potsdam leipzig gera and several other cities fire trucks and 
garbage trucks blocked several streets and the airport in leipzig 
was temporarily closed 
in bonn west germanys capital interior minister wolfgang 
schaeuble said a treaty to serve as the document formally merging 
the nations on oct 3 and meshing their laws is near approval 
closeddoor talks among government and opposition officials 
continued into the night in an effort to clear up the remaining 
difficulties but schaeuble said no difficulties were expected in 
getting the approval of all sides 
parties within kohls coalition had already signaled they would 
yield to the opposition social democrats insistence no west german 
women be prosecuted for seeking abortions in east germany after 
unity 
the leftofcenter social democrats had threatened to veto the 
treaty over that issue 
but late wednesday another disagreement arose in the abortion 
dispute how long after unity the two germanys would keep their 
widely differing abortion laws 
east germanys abortion law is far more permissive than west 
germanys 
the major political parties had already agreed the two germanys 
should keep their respective abortion laws for an interim twoyear 
period until an allgerman parliament can choose abortion statutes 
for a united germany 
but the social democrats insisted wednesday night that there 
should be a threeyear extension if the allgerman parliament fails 
to agree on a new abortion law lawmakers from kohls coalition 
said the more restrictive west german abortion regulations should 
automatically extend to what is now east germany at the end of two 
years 
earlier wednesday schaeuble expressed confidence that all major 
obstacles to the treaty would be worked out 
schaeuble also said kohls government and west germanys 11 
states agreed that oct 3 the chosen date of unity will be 
written into the treaty as an allgerman national holiday 
the interior minister told reporters the treaty will likely be 
signed friday in west berlin at a ceremony in the reichstag the 
former parliament and one of germanys most important landmarks 
if everything goes according to my own desires 
he said the two german governments will hold one final round of 
negotiations on the treaty thursday 
schaeuble made the remarks after kohl met with governors of the 
11 west german states most of whom belong to the opposition social 
democrat party 
the conservative chancellor needs a twothirds parliamentary 
majority to ratify the treaty and thus the support of the social 
democrats the secondlargest party in west germany 
the social democrats had given kohl until wednesday to reverse 
his earlier decision on abortion during the past two days he had 
given strong signals he would do so rather than jeopardize the 
treaty 
approval of the treaty was not essential for unification but 
leaders of both nations considered it imperative that they 
negotiate such a document rather than allow west german law to 
simply take effect automatically in east germany 
but there were intense differences even within kohls 
coalition over his earlier decision that west german women be 
legally barred from seeking abortions in east germany 
in another issue threatening to block the treaty west germanys 
states were afraid they might get unfair treatment when it comes to 
divvying up sales tax revenues with the five soontoberesurrected 
east german states 
under the draft treaty east german states will get a smaller 
proportion of the revenues than west german states because of their 
smaller economies 
nonetheless the treaty will pave the way for more assistance 
than the east german states now receive from west germany

a district judge has released eight indians 
accused of participating in a drug cult that allegedly killed about 
30 people a lawyer for a government advocacy group said wednesday 
the action by judge jose cuevas zavala in tepic 400 miles 
northwest of mexico city represents another blow to the 
spectacular case launched by federal police in july 
in comments to reporters last month the judge ridiculed police 
allegations that the indians had killed about 30 people in satanic 
rituals 
prosecutors in neighboring durango state where the killings 
allegedly occurred refused to press charges in connection with the 
alleged deaths 
no human remains were found and senior church officials in the 
area denied the existence of a satanic cult 
the national indian institute a government organization to 
protect indians joined the case to help tepehuano indian 
defendants it said were being mistreated by police 
the institute attorney carlos puga quiroga said the judge on 
tuesday ordered the eight released on their own recognizance they 
still face the only charges filed against them cultivating 
marijuana in their remote villages 
in addition puga said five minors held in the case have been 
cleared of any charges and will be released to their parents 
only one man olayo soto soto remains imprisoned in the case 
puga said soto is accused of owning the land on which police found 
a small marijuana patch while the others were accused only of 
helping cultivate the crop 
in july federal police in tepic claimed soto was the chief 
sorcerer of a cult that worshipped an idol called el amigo or 
the friend that had sacrificed 30 or more people to gain 
protection for their drug activities 
members of the group initially confessed to the allegations 
during police questioning but they recanted before the judge 
saying the confessions had been beaten out of them 
soto told reporters he is a traditional indian healer but he 
denied practicing any sorcery the institute also has appealed for 
his release 
in an earlier drugcult case police in april 1989 found 15 
bodies buried on a ranch near the northern city of matamoros across 
the usmexico border from brownsville texas among those slain 
21yearold university of texas student mark kilroy 
 
police claimed those victims were slain by drug smugglers who 
believed human sacrifices would protect them from police 
group leader adolfo de jesus constanzo and his bodyguard died of 
gunshot wounds as police closed in on them in a mexico city 
apartment in may 1989 ten people still face charges in connection 
with the case

deliveries of supplies including fuels for some time 
so far almost 2 million tons of oil and derivatives have not

a law has been drafted to open the first 
stock exchange in postwar poland a government spokesman said 
wednesday 
the law on securities and the stock market represents the next 
step in polands legislative drive toward introducing capitalism 
last month the parliament passed a statute on selling stateowned 
industries to private owners 
jan buchacz a spokesman for the government committee 
established to reform polands laws on ownership said the draft 
law on the stock exchange is ready for public discussion 
we want everyone to add his opinion and see if there is no 
essential discrepancy in it he said 
he said the law could be passed by parliament within the next 
few weeks 
creation of the stock exchange is fundamental to polands 
economic reform program which is aimed at transforming the 
centralized economy to a marketdriven system under the 
privatization law all citizens are to be given bonds which can be 
exchanged for stock in the previously stateowned companies 
the draft law provides a legal framework for the functioning of 
the stock market establishing a statecontrolled stock exchange 
and a committee to grant licenses for issuing and selling shares 
the government daily rzeczpospolita reported wednesday 
i treat it as a continuation of the privatization law 
another push another expression of that law buchacz told the 
associated press 
the government committee studied international stock markets and 
followed various solutions and experiences especially of the 
british and american systems buchacz said 
but we also watched closely what was happening in hungary 
he said referring to the first stock exchange in the east bloc 
which opened in budapest on june 21 
rzeczpospolita observed that implementation of the stock 
exchange law will mean creation of a new professional group 
brokers who will receive licenses from the stock committee and 
will be expected to form an association 
buchacz said his committee is preparing training programs and 
examinations for brokers a profession virtually unknown in poland 
and hopes that the first brokers will receive licenses in october 
or november 
after this law is passed we will need only a lot of wise 
heads he added 
poland had a stock exchange until 1939 when nazi germany 
invaded the sovietbacked communists who consolidated power after 
world war ii did not reopen it

officials at two key army supply 
depots said wednesday their staffs were working around the clock to 
outfit troops sent to saudi arabia despite layoff announcements 
that some say have affected morale 
the officers at the new cumberland army depot and the 
letterkenny army depot in chambersburg pa took reporters and 
photographers on a tour of their bases 
col john k joseph commander of the new cumberland depot said 
his employees dedication to the desert shield mission had overcome 
dismay over a layoff announcement that came aug 8 just as the 
buildup was getting underway 
my impression is the troops are ok he said at a briefing 
they are pretty patriotic folks and theyre dedicated theyre 
down there supporting the soldiers that are over there and theyre 
proud to do it 
the depot has been working two shifts seven days a week in the 
wake of the american response to the aug 2 iraqi invasion of 
kuwait joseph said in some areas three shifts are going he 
said most of the employees are civilians 
at letterkenny col david gordon director of supply said the 
supply and ammunition depots have gone to either 12hour shifts or 
three eighthour shifts people have been generally willing to work 
overtime he said 
the attitudes been real good gordon said 
faced with budget cuts the army materiel command announced 
three weeks ago that 365 of the 2500 employees at new cumberland 
and 450 of 3400 at letterkenny would be laid off oct 12 
steve lightfoot a 12year employee who works in the shipping 
section at new cumberland said the layoffs are a sore subject 
everywhere 
with the middle east crisis the work load is increasing but 
morale is so far down because they know theyre losing their jobs 
and its hard to do the job said lightfoot not among those who 
have received pink slips 
some employees facing layoffs are working hard but others 
arent he said 
joseph said the reductions were based on assumptions and budget 
decisions before the iraqi invasion 
this action in the desert changed all that he said the 
department of the army is looking at how to fix that i 
personally hope they do change it 
new cumberland an 850acre base across the susquehanna river 
from the state capital supplies 88 percent of the goods the army 
ships to overseas posts its 35 billion inventory includes 
307569 items ranging from clothing to spare parts and tools 
the items are loaded onto trucks for shipment to ports in 
baltimore or bayonne nj or to air force bases at dover del 
and other east coast locations 
at the 19000acre letterkenny depot four shipping crews of 
four to five people work shifts of about 12 hours moving ammunition 
to desert shield and other units about 15 truckloads a day have 
been going out since early august said frank van hatten director 
of ammunition operations 
the depot stores ammunition ranging from small arms bullets to 
2000pound bombs and some conventionally armed missiles in 902 
earthcovered igloos and 10 warehouses 
workers were loading boxes of 50caliber bullets and smoke 
grenades from one igloo as reporters watched 
van hatten said about 1 percent of the depots ammunition stock 
has been drawn down since the american force was deployed to saudi 
arabia 
at a truck painting and rehabilitation building workers were 
putting tan paint on military vehicles gordon said theyve run out 
of desert sand color and are getting low on tan as well

with tear gas on tuesday they hurled stones and bottles at cars 
full of mohawks leaving the reservation in anticipation of a 
confrontation between warriors and soldiers

more than 100 supporters of ousted 
prime minister benazir bhutto have been arrested in the latest 
crackdown against ethnic violence in her home province police said 
wednesday 
a moslem leader said he will join forces with the ousted leader 
to compete in october elections and fight a mounting 
getbenazir campaign 
a week of raids across southern sindh province began after aug 
2223 sniper shootings in karachi killed at least 31 people police 
said 
the militarybacked caretaker government that replaced ms 
bhuttos government three weeks ago blamed her pakistan peoples 
party for the attacks it has not provided proof of the allegations 
ms bhuttos supporters say many peoples party activists 
including members of the former sindh provincial government have 
gone into hiding 
the former prime minister has accused the caretaker government 
of trying to force her out of politics before the oct 24 general 
elections president ghulam ishaq khan dismissed ms bhutto and her 
government aug 6 citing a variety of charges that included 
inability to curb ethnic violence in sindh 
more than 500 people have been killed since late may in gang 
warfare between native sindhis belonging to the peoples party and 
members of the militant mohajir qami movement or refugee peoples 
movement the army has been called out to restore peace and 
maintain order 
the mohajir movement represents moslem indians who immigrated to 
pakistan following the 1947 partition that ended british colonial 
rule of the subcontinent it aligned itself with the peoples party 
in the november 1988 elections and helped ms bhutto become prime 
minister but mohajir members withdrew their support a year later 
claiming ms bhutto had reneged on a variety of promises 
in islamabad on wednesday malik qasim head of a small renegade 
faction of the conservative pakistan moslem league said there 
is a dangerous polarization taking shape in the country 
while opposing ms bhutto on many ideological points qasim said 
he would ally his small faction with ms bhuttos leftofcenter 
peoples party in order to see that she gets a fair chance in the 
elections 
he said the caretaker government is based on partisanship 
many analysts say the military could seize power during the 
political uncertainty the military had ruled for 25 of pakistans 
43year history 
qasim also questioned judicial tribunals set up last weekend to 
investigate charges of widespread corruption under ms bhutto 
ms bhutto has said she will boycott the tribunals and accused 
her successors of launching a witch hunt against her party and her 
husband asif ali zardari 
qasim said the allegations cited to justify ms bhuttos 
dismissal could apply to her opponents some of whom now sit in the 
caretaker government 
this caretaker government cannot run fair elections he said

mohawk warriors at oka were waiting behind a 
barricade with automatic rifles on wednesday for a confrontation 
that didnt take place 
an electric surge raced through the scene as word spread that 
the army had set a 2 pm deadline for a signed agreement or an 
assault at the mercier bridge farther down the st lawrence south 
of montreal 
a masked member of the mohawk warrior society puffed up the 
blacktop road to the barricade of logs and wrecked car bodies to 
spread the word and alert the indian forces facing the canadian 
army 325 feet farther down the hill 
shake ratttle and roll muttered one of the men on the 
barricade armed with an automatic weapon 
moments later mohawk spokeswoman kahntineta horn drove up to 
brief a band of reporters with what she said was information from 
secret lastditch talks at a suburban montreal hotel an army 
officer had interrupted the talks and announced the deadline she 
said 
it appears the army and the provincial police have gone out 
of control she said adding that a human rights observer was 
working to get the assault called off 
a grayhaired indian in a camouflage poncho pulled up in a golf 
cart 
dont do nothin drastic he told the fighters who huddled 
around him youve all got minds of your own 
two oclock passed with no word of an assault three oclock 
threethirty 
were going to be here when they get here said a mohawk 
warrior who calls himself hunter 
were not going to fire first 
hunter is a 20yearold american mohawk a former student at the 
university of minnesota 
what will he do if the army rolls up and starts pushing down the 
barricade with tanks fitted with bulldozer blades 
its going to be decided on the spot the decision on how we 
react he said 
the army said it would not shoot first the mohawks who first 
threw up a barricade march 11 and repulsed an assault by the 
provincial police on july 11 said they would not shoot first 
so what would happen if the army marched up the hill not 
shooting and that barricade suddenly started moving backward 
thats gonna be wild huh said a warrior known as black 
jack smiling 
a bulldozer then well have to put a bulldozer on them 
right you cant give up 
the original dispute at oka over the proposed expansion of a 
golf course onto land claimed by the indians was solved the 
federal government bought the land and is ready to turn it over to 
the mohawks 
but the standoff now seven weeks old has gone far beyond a 
mere golf course in this tranquil village along the shores of the 
st lawrence river the indians seized the occasion and public 
attention to air the whole range of their grievances 
the situation at oka was less dramatic than at the mercier 
bridge near chateauguay where thousands of suburbanites have been 
cut off from their jobs in montreal forced to make long detours to 
get into the island city 
there anger rose steadily and the considerable capital of 
public sympathy for the mohawks and their cause burned up fast 
leading to numerous violent incidents 
down the hill the army waited and waited 
all is calm said a corporal on the forwardmost army 
sandbag bunker were just waiting were just like you watching 
the television 
its long said another soldier waiting for something 
will they really attack 
its hard to believe im just waiting for something here 
he said picking up up a radio handset 
capt yvon desjardins army spokesman in the oka area said that 
after the order from quebec premier robert bourassa to tear down 
the barricades the army continued to patrol and carry out aerial 
surveillance 
oka is nearly a ghost town a few residents remain but not many 
thats gonna be wild huh another warrior known as black 
jack said smiling 
a bulldozer then well have to put a bulldozer on them 
right you cant give up 
black jack wearing fatigues a baseball cap and peering through 
blue sunglasses didnt look too worried about imminent danger 
were a military force he said not a bunch of 
terrorists were here until the final minute 
the women are strong theyll be here when the assault 
comes if the men get shot we die here the women will pick up 
the guns the women are warriors too 
but as the day wore on there was no sign of army movement 
against the mohawks at oka the warriors at the barricade sat back 
and sipped cold pepsis 
were just waiting

the group out of fear for herself and her children 
im not a coldblooded murderer he is she said referring 
to her husband 
i too was numbered on the list of intended victims i am 
not the angel of death i am the mother of four i was found 
guilty of a crime i had no knowledge would occur said mrs

plans for a new us sale of weapons to saudi 
arabia were revealed tuesday as congressional leaders expressed 
support at least for now of the bush administrations 
intervention in the middle east 
the united states intends to sell nearly 3 billion in new 
weapons to saudi arabia including 24 f15 fighter planes and 150 
m60 tanks congressional sources said 
the administration notified congress of the plans as about 170 
lawmakers returned from a summer break for their first facetoface 
briefing from president bush since he began sending troops to the 
persian gulf three weeks ago 
so far so good said house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo reflecting near unanimous congressional backing 
for the military moves and wariness about the future 
there is a sense of awe at how brilliantly bush has handled 
this said house minority whip newt gingrich rga 
rep william gray dpa the thirdranking house leader said 
the nation will continue to support the presence of us troops in 
saudi arabia provided we do not get into a protracted struggle 
with loss of life with no prospect for victory 
i am convinced that no matter how this ends we will have an 
added presence there for a long time and i think the american 
people need to be made aware of that said rep david obey dwis 
during the hourlong meeting other lawmakers said they expressed 
concern that the nation lacks an energy policy to cope with oil 
shortages some also said us allies must bear a bigger share of 
the military and financial burden in deterring iraqi president 
saddam hussein 
the saudi military sale would include 15000 rounds of depleted 
uranium antitank ammunition and 200 stinger antiaircraft missiles 
those items cannot be sold to riyadh unless bush certifies it is in 
americas national security interest 
the arms package is designed to bolster saudi defenses against 
neighboring iraq and further sales are possible said the sources 
who requested anonymity 
those sources did not detail what the future possibilities are 
the washington post said in wednesday editions that a second sale 
of 24 f15s was planned for 1991 the 48 additional f15s would 
bring the total sold to saudi arabia to 110 compared with the 
current congressionally imposed limit of 62 
saudi arabia has welcomed bushs troop deployment and has agreed 
to increase oil production to help offset losses from iraqi oil 
fields 
in opening remarks to about 170 members of congress who returned 
to washington from their summer recess for the briefing bush 
appealed for support and added let no one at home doubt my 
commitment to work with the congress and let no one abroad doubt 
our national unity or our staying power 
bush also said iraq must withdraw from kuwait but he did not 
publicly address a question on the minds of some lawmakers 
whether hussein himself must be deposed 
in advance of the white house briefing sen richard lugar 
rind said that was a clear requirement for settling the crisis 
lugar a member of the foreign relations committee also said 
iraqs invasion of kuwait has demonstrated the united states is the 
worlds lone remaining superpower with the military and political 
clout to find a solution he also urged president bush to spell out 
the costs of what could be a longterm military commitment 
military force probably will be needed to force saddam from 
power lugar said he does have to leave the leadership of the 
country and many of the forces he has aggregated have to be 
removed as a threat he said 
bush met briefly first with a group that included sen george 
mitchell dmaine and house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
gephardt and minority leader robert michel rill that was 
followed by a briefing for other members of congress including 
those on the armed services foreign affairs intelligence and 
appropriations committees 
also briefing the members were defense secretary dick cheney 
cia director william webster secretary of state james a baker iii 
who cut short a wyoming vacation and joint chiefs of staff 
chairman colin powell 
afterward gephardt said the increased cost of the deployment 
25 billion through september and possible more for a longer stay 
will affect budget talks between congress and the white house 
the firstyear savings target of 50 billion may have to be scaled 
back to 35 billion or so but the overall fiveyear total savings 
should still reach the original 500 billion goal he said 
two separate bipartisan congressional delegations one from the 
house led by majority leader richard gephardt dmo and one from 
the senate led by sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the 
foreign relations committe will leave friday on an inspection trip 
to saudi arabia returning monday

the killings of five people in 
gainesville this week evoked memories of another florida campus 
nightmare the fatal bludgeoning of two sorority sisters by serial 
killer ted bundy 12 years ago 
everybody knows that it happened here kim ewing a 
sophomore at florida state university said tuesday its kind of 
the first thing you associate with killings like this 
this weeks killings occurred near the university of florida 
campus about 2 hours to the southeast 
a chill swept through the state capital when margaret bowman and 
lisa levy were found slain on jan 15 1978 at the chi omega 
sorority house three other women students were severely beaten 
with an oak limb 
lt jack handley of the florida state university police 
department who was on the force when it happened said people had 
trouble accepting that such a crime happened in quiet tallahassee 
if youre looking for one way to describe it i would say it 
was total disbelief handley said these things just are not 
supposed to happen in a college community 
bundy was executed in floridas electric chair jan 24 1989 
for the february 1978 killing of 12yearold kimberly leach who 
was abducted in lake city about a month after the chi omega murders 
crowds cheered outside the florida state prison when the switch 
was thrown 
bundy also received the death penalty for the sorority slayings 
and authorities believe he was responsible for three dozen other 
killings across the country 
diane cossin now an executive assistant to us attorney dexter 
lehtinen in miami was a member of chi omega and was awakened by 
the sounds of her two friends being killed she comforted one of 
the victims before she died and later was a witness at bundys 
trial 
what i remember was an enormous feeling of loss of the 
shattering of the safety you felt it was like being in a crisis 
she said fear is elevated a great amount of anxiety was felt by 
everyone 
cossin had to put off law school while the trial was held and 
when she returned she decided to shift her focus from family to 
criminal law when lehtinen was in the florida legislature she 
helped him draft legislation expanding rights of crime victims 
i think it played a big part in what i do now you can either 
avoid something or you can get in there and try to do something 
about it she said 
rhonda lee a sophomore from cape coral said the most 
frightening thing about bundy was his seeming normalcy the 
onetime law student was an intelligent goodlooking man few would 
identify as a murderer 
he looked like kind of a nice guy he could be anybody you 
might meet he could be the guy across the hall or the guy next 
door she said 
security was beefed up tuesday at florida state and other state 
college campuses 
handley said authorities had received dozens of calls from 
parents and students worried that the gainesville killer or killers 
might come to tallahassee 
im trying to control the rumor factor but people are very 
concerned he said ive had quite a few mention ted bundy

in a crowded refugee center ghulam hussain 
ali thought about the job he lost in kuwait and how he may support 
his two sons if he returns to impoverished pakistan 
he raised his palms to allah 
nobody here knows what he will do said the 28yearold 
former port guard there is no work too many people in 
pakistan 
each day asian workers fleeing kuwait and iraq join thousands 
already in the refugee centers where jordanian officials provide 
limited services while urging governments to aid in repatriating 
the often destitute and desperate people 
some officials estimate the potential asian rufugee wave could 
swell into the hundreds of thousands about 250000 foreigners 
including arabs have fled to jordan since the iraqi invasion of 
neighboring kuwait on aug 2 
we expect an avalanche said sofi ullah the bangladeshi 
consul in abu dhabi who came to jordan to supervise repatriation 
he said 600 were flown home and 9000 remain this is the best we 
can do he said 
most of the workers who came to the persian gulf seeking better 
jobs fled nearly penniless with whatever they could grab a small 
radio a few shirts a koran a soup spoon 
egyptians and sudanese are flown out directly from aqaba 
jordan but bangladeshis pakistanis indians sri lankans thais 
filipinos and nepalese wait for word from their governments 
jordanian volunteer committees provide food tents and basic 
essentials 
but a senior jordanian official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity stressed that resources are limited 
no one will be allowed to stay in jordan he said we 
dont want to push governments but we expect cooperation soon we 
will not allow a refugee problem here 
at the rate they are taking us home it will be six months 
said mosharof hussain khan a bangladeshi refugee from kuwait 
after six months in this place a man will die four times 
khan sat on a mat among other refugees at an amman exhibition 
hall forbidden to go outside because neighbors complained they 
were begging and relieving themselves in public 
we have 22000 people living here and toilets maybe 10 
khan said you can think about that 
ullah said 70000 bangladeshis worked in kuwait with another 
7000 in iraq 
khan and his friends assailed bangladeshi authorities saying a 
consular officer visited the amman international fair camp but 
refused to talk to anyone 
one plane every other day this is impossible mujibar 
rahman said 
we have extremely limited resources ullah said we wish 
that some friendly country or charitable organization will make 
available a hercules transport plane or a jumbo jet or a ship 
to help us 
at a separate center nearly 5000 pakistanis await flights 
home more arrive than leave 
refugees sprawl listlessly on mats wait in water lines or sit 
and brood at lunchtime they stand hours in line for a piece of 
bread a tomato and a thin slice of salami 
everyone wants to do something good but we dont know where 
to start said hind talib a nurse who is helping with sanitation 
at the center 
early on tuesday one bangladeshi attacked another with an iron 
bar in a quarrel over mattress space 
yet the refugees worry more about the future 
at the amman international fair a crowd of 40 bangladeshis 
gathered around a reporter who stopped to talk one asked out loud 
in bengali if anyone had even a faint prospect for a job back home 
no all shouted in unison 
others left with no choice are calmer 
manop kraiwan a stocky thai driver in an electric blue jogging 
outfit took in the scene with a stoic smile he has been in kuwait 
almost five years supporting a young son he has never seen 
i dont know where to look for work anymore he said 
things change but im trying

magellans mission to map venus has been 
delayed again until late september while nasa tries to figure out 
why the spacecraft keeps losing touch with earth 
have patience with us were going to make it work tony 
spear magellan project manager at the space agencys jet 
propulsion laboratory said tuesday 
magellans radio link to earth failed for 14 hours starting aug 
16 and for 17 hours beginning aug 21 while the craft was in 
orbit around venus 
spear said he organized a team of 40 engineers from the lab and 
from martin marietta corp which built magellan in denver to 
determine what is wrong with the spacecraft and fix it 
before magellan started malfunctioning nasa planned for it to 
make pictures and maps of venus on a regular basis starting 
saturday last week spear said engineers hoped to have magellan 
working properly by midseptember 
now he said were targeting for the last week in september 
to start mapping 
mapping is being delayed not only to fix magellan but also 
because the crafts troubles have left engineers mentally and 
physically exhausted spear said weve decided to give the 
team three days off around labor day 
magellans 744 million mission is to use radar to peer through 
venus thick clouds and make the best pictures and maps yet of the 
planets surface the spacecraft was launched from space shuttle 
atlantis in may 1989 
pictures made during an aug 16 test showed quake faults vast 
solidified lava flows cinder cones a lavafilled meteorite impact 
crater and countless valleys and mountain ridges on earths nearest 
planetary neighbor 
magellan functioned almost flawlessly during the 15 months it 
traveled a looping 948millionmile route to venus one major 
theory is that something went wrong when the craft went into orbit 
around venus on aug 10 spear said 
nasa also has been troubled by the temporary grounding of the 
shuttle fleet and a focusing flaw on the hubble space telescope 
spear said engineeers will try to determine if previously 
unknown electrical fields or particles around venus are disrupting 
magellans electronics 
the engineers will also examine a computer that ran amok during 
the communications failures and look at changes in magellan as it 
went into orbit including the possibility of short circuits 
spear ruled out the possibility raised friday that magellans 
braking rocket may have failed to separate from the spacecraft 
after it went into orbit

a spokesman for prince turki bin abdul 
aziz of saudi arabia would like you to know the prince is a fairly 
regular guy 
even if he owns several homes and palaces has a staff of 4000 
and belongs to the secondrichest family in the world 
with an entourage of nearly 100 people and a tractortrailer 
filled with luggage thats a tough sell when you pull into a hotel 
as the royal family did here four weeks ago at a cost of about 
10000 a day 
fact and fantasy quickly become blurred 
take for example the story of a cambridge police officer on 
the special security detail who said that turki ordered the air 
conditioning turned off on the two floors he took over on arriving 
at the charles hotel in harvard square 
they like to keep it like it is in their country all the cops 
working up there are dying said the officer who spoke on 
condition of anonymity a kid told us they even had a space 
heater up there 
for mustapha aziz the princes political adviser and spokesman 
the reaction is typical to princes from oilrich nations such as 
saudi arabia under scrutiny since american and other troops were 
sent there following the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
no the airconditioning is not off aziz said that kind 
of stereotype is too much 
everyone thinks we are coming here with many wives that kind 
of thing it does not apply to this family he is out of that 
picture of greedy princes 
still the 53yearold princes penchant for frequent travel and 
long stays at expensive hotels is unusual 
the youngest of king fahds six brothers turki has no business 
dealings lives off his inheritance and does largely philanthropic 
work he travels with a staff of 60 to 100 including seven cooks 
the costs of about 40 to 50 rooms at the charles to house workers 
and set up offices with facsimile machines telephones and a 
satellite dish may exceed 10000 
aziz said that is not a big entourage for a member of the fahd 
family which is worth 18 billion and is the second richestfamily 
in the world according to fortune magazine we have three full 
shifts he said 
another police officer said the prince who has his own security 
detail also hired two dozen cambridge officers at 200 per day 
thats for each man said the officer who spoke on 
condition of anonymity and hes got about eight harvard cops and 
some other guys 
the officer said when the princes 11yearold son wanted to 
play video games one day he was escorted to an arcade by four 
police officers 
the kid had 300 in quarters with him he added 
aziz could not confirm or deny those reports nor could he hide 
his irritation 
the prince does not like to show off he gives hundreds of 
donations every month but he refuses to be identified as the man 
who gave it his is not the trump style said aziz 
aziz said that had the iraqi invasion not occurred few would 
have known he was in town to discuss contributions to harvard and 
have his three children get medical checkups 
at a recent news conference to discuss events in the mideast 
the prince was affable but unassuming but the breakfast he offered 
for reporters was certainly one befitting a prince 
there was cheese brie camembert saga blue and port salut a 
dozen fruits six fruit juices smoked salmon with caviar petit 
filet mignon belgium waffles poached eggs on pumpernickel muffin 
with basil hollandaise two preparation stations for egg dishes 
and a full mideast menu 
waiters presented a longstemmed red rose to each woman in 
attendance and it was all set off by 750 orchids 
like her husband princess hend wore western clothes 
she made headlines years ago when she got in a melee with police 
checking out reports of mistreatment of workers at the princes 
home in florida thats the house where the family created a stir 
with a lavish birthday party for his son that included a cake 
topped off with live flamingos 
at one point in the news conference the princess whose english 
is good interrupted to say the translator had mangled the exchange 
between a reporter and the prince he tried again 
her royal highness is the type who likes to speak her mind 
everyone in the media try to harm this image said aziz she is 
the type of woman for our future

members of congress are praising president 
bushs handling so far of the middle east crisis but some who 
interrupted their summer break for a presidential briefing are wary 
about the future 
i dont think theres a question of a blank check here for 
the president said house speaker thomas s foley dwash but 
during an hourlong meeting tuesday with bush and top aides 
there were really no overall reservations by the 170 or so 
lawmakers present he said 
both democrats and republicans were effusive about bushs 
diplomacy the garnering of international support for an economic 
boycott of iraq the winning of united nations backing for military 
enforcement of the blockade and his enlistment of arab military 
forces in the regional show of strength 
for the moment among professional politicians there is a 
sense of awe at how brilliantly bush has handled this said rep

a judge nearly wept as she gave the roman 
catholic church permission to exhume the remains of a former 
haitian slave who has been proposed for canonization as the first 
black american saint 
acting state supreme court justice phyllis gangeljacob on 
tuesday granted the request from the archdiocese of new york to 
exhume pierre toussaints body for identification by a pathologist 
and church officials 
it is rare that this court has an opportunity to participate 
in such a historic event if only tangentially the judge said 
church records show toussaint who died a free man in 1853 at 
87 was buried at old st patricks cathedral 
court papers referred to him as a model of charity who is 
considered the founder of catholic charities because he helped the 
needy for 66 years when no formal systems of assistance existed

orthodox worshipers climbed the holy 
mountain last month in their annual pilgrimage but the wooden 
chapel that greeted the faithful for nearly three centuries was 
gone burned to the ground 
the tiny chapel and its priceless icons were destroyed july 12 
a month later the joy of the annual pilgrimage to grabarka was 
cloaked with grief and suspicion 
a convict on a fiveday leave from prison was charged with 
setting the fire because he could not break into the chapel to 
steal a gold cross 
priests and their followers are troubled not only by the 
destruction of the orthodox faiths holiest shrine in poland but 
by fear that the motivation was darker than robbery 
it was a blow at the heart of orthodoxy aimed to destroy 
us said one priest who would not give his name most people 
think the only religion in poland should be catholic 
there have been several attacks on orthodox churches in poland 
a nation of 38 million people that is 93 percent roman catholic 
st marys was the sixth orthodox church burned in five years 
the government newspaper rzeczpospolita reported 
keston college a british organization that monitors religious 
freedom also has expressed concern about attacks on orthodox 
institutions in poland 
orthodoxy holds many tenets similar to roman catholicism but 
rejects the primacy of the pope it is polands largest religious 
minority with an estimated 800000 followers many of them ethnic 
byelorussians from the eastern provinces 
during the threeday orthodox pilgrimage up to 60000 people 
climbed to this village 75 miles west of warsaw and 15 from the 
soviet border 
the springfed waters of the holy mountain in reality a small 
hill are supposed to have cured a prophets followers of plague in 
1710 
pilgrims some climbing on their knees carried wooden crosses 
to be planted on the hilltop amid the thousands of weathered 
mosscovered offerings of previous years many of which were 
charred by the fire 
this is a special year one when we are all living through 
this great loss said eugeniusz zabrodski a priest from nearby 
drohiczyn 
looking at the burned wood and the altar where i used to say 
divine liturgy i could only wonder how anyone could do this he 
said 
on sunday aug 19 the observances culminated in the 
consecration of the cornerstone of a new church 
collection boxes for the building fund dotted the hill 
donations from around the world totaled 8420 and the polish 
senate which condemned the arson contributed 5260 
there is controversy about what kind of church to build 
some think it should be wood just like it was but others want 
to take advantage of the opportunity and build something much 
larger zabrodski said 
for now services are conducted on a makeshift wooden altar 
dwarfed by towering pines with singed branches 
the happy chatter of pilgrims washing in the waters below 
reached the hushed reverence of the shrine elderly women their 
heads covered by scarves in the orthodox tradition circled the 
altar on their knees 
many faithful spent the night kneeling in prayer the divine 
liturgy in old church slavonic was conducted virtually without 
cease from 6 pm saturday until sunday afternoon 
polands orthodox church is independent of russian orthodoxy to 
which it lost an estimated 45 million followers after world war 
ii when the soviet union annexed eastern poland 
both churches descend from the orthodox faith that developed in 
constantinople after the great schism of 1054 
at grabarka worshipers and clergy communicated in a polyglot of 
polish russian byelorussian and slovak reflecting the mix of 
peoples who feel the tug of the shrine year after year 
we came here to get our strength because this is where the 
orthodox are said ania a 20yearold law student from bialystok

this labor day weekend as the persian gulf 
crisis and the us military buildup in saudi arabia continue a 
special called medal of honor will air on tv stations around 
the country 
it is possible that the debut date the show is the first of 
six onehour specials about the men who earned the nations highest 
military honor for bravery may strike some cynics as just too 
coincidental 
yes im a little worried that people will take it the wrong 
way that were trying to cash in on on public support of us 
forces says pat duncan coauthor and director of the specials 
but its premiere date is a coincidence nothing more the show 
was announced well before the gulf crisis began and weve been 
working on these specials for 18 months he said 
unlike many film and tv folk who in recent years have tackled 
war and specifically vietnam as a topic duncan and his medal 
coauthor retired marine capt russ thurman know whereof they 
write in combat matters 
each is a vietnam veteran with grunt time in that war duncan 
with the armys 173rd airborne brigade and thurman as an enlisted 
man who after the war became a mustang an upfromtheranks 
officer 
duncans experiences helped him create the home box office 
anthology series vietnam war stories and the muchpraised 
84 charlie mopic a documentarystyle film drama about a 
longrange army patrol in vietnam 
the medal of honor specials all are narrated by cliff 
robertson are produced by us news amp world report the first 
will be shown on at least 124 stations on labor day weekend the 
producers said 
filled with combat footage along with home movies or still 
photographs of each subject the specials arent dramatic 
recreations save in one respect it uses actors voices 
including that of thurman in one segment to depict those of the 
men in combat stories told 
each special is to air on a patriotic holiday with the final 
one on july 4th the first three are about medal of honor 
recipients in world war ii and the fourth about those in korea 
the last two cover the vietnam war 
a total of 20 receipients are profiled three to four per show 
one of them army maj gen patrick brady a medivac helicopter 
pilot in vietnam has a double distinction his story was told last 
year in heroes a cable series shown on the arts amp 
entertainment network 
the idea of medal of honor thurman said is a to show the 
personal side of each recipient his life before his war and after 
it if he survived and b explain what earned him the medal 
we hired a whole platoon of researchers he said my task 
was to go through the immense amount of material we had to 
separate the wheat from the chaff because a lot of research turned 
up overly written articles from early era mens magazines that 
embellished everything 
the idea was to get down to the hardcore facts using 
interviews and other eyewitness documentation to recapture the 
event 
the work at times could be difficult he said because we 
found out that the eyewitnesses to the event if you ask them today 
what happened tend to embellish but the recipient if hes alive 
tends to downplay 
is there a common thread in the way those interviewed talk about 
their war 
most of them say they were just doing their job duncan 
said theyre all pretty humble about it pat brady who went 
through three helicopters and saved 51 men one day is a good 
example 
he said i had days when i saved more men 125 and days when 
i went through more helicopters there just happened to be somebody 
around recording things on the day his medivac flights into 
viet cong and north vietnamese ground fire earned him the medal of 
honor 
the general portrait that emerges of these men thurman said is 
not of hardchargers bent on proving their courage or risking their 
lives for an abstraction called their country 
most proved to be ordinary americans who for a moment 
sometimes a very brief moment did extraordinary things he said 
very few times did they ever do it for their country 
most of the time they did it for the guy next to them

in this era of turbulence and innovation in the 
world of personal finance not all the hot ideas are new ideas 
consider that venerable vehicle known as the annuity a simple 
form of contract which provides investors with a steady stream of 
income that is designed to keep flowing until they die 
true the basic idea may have been invented by ancients who rode 
to work on horseback and kept their ledgers with a goosequill pen 
but the annuity 1990style boasts many features of the computer age 
and the powersthatbe have given annuities tax advantages that 
rank them right up there competitively with more modern 
contrivances like individual retirement accounts and 401k savings 
plans 
if you wish you can choose among fixed annuities variable 
annuities singlepremium annualpremium and flexiblepremium 
annuities annuities with or without an early bailout clause 
while the list of options may require some extensive study 
financial advisers say there is a common set of questions to ask 
and standards to apply in evaluating annuities in all their forms 
most annuities offered today are deferred annuities that 
is they provide for payments starting some time perhaps many 
years after the first premiums are paid 
in the interim the money is put to work for either a fixed 
return spelled out in the contract or a variable return that 
depends on the performance of a mutual fund 
as in an ira or 401k the earnings build up free of incometax 
obligations until withdrawals begin 
the deferred annuity offers investors two attractive features 
in one package tax deferral and growth potential observes 
william brennan a specialist in financial planning matters at the 
accounting firm of ernst amp young 
and unlike iras or pension plans there is no limit to the 
amount that can be deposited each year says henry montag a 
financial planner writing in the current issue of the newsletter 
the moneypaper published in mamaroneck ny 
payments of annuity premiums arent eligible for any tax 
deduction at the time they are made but when annuity payments 
begin only the portion of those payments that represents 
investment earnings is subject to income tax 
the amount of the payments will depend upon the amount of 
premiums paid the earnings over the years the investors age and 
the insurers annuity payout rates brennan notes 
by its very nature an investment in a deferred annuity tends to 
be a longterm proposition for one thing it takes time for 
taxfree compounding to work to your benefit 
for another annuity issuers typically impose surrender charges 
or other fees on withdrawals in the early years of the contract as 
with iras the government collects a 10 percent penalty tax on 
withdrawals before you reach age 59 
financial advisers say investors should check thoroughly into 
such fees before they commit themselves and understand what 
provisions the contract makes for them to withdraw their money and 
move it elsewhere 
in a variable annuity for example annual fees can reduce the 
return you might realize from what you could get in a conventional 
mutual fund investment 
an investor should consider how long it would take for the 
potentially lower annual yield of the annuity to be overcome by the 
benefit of taxdeferred compounding brennan says 
as a general rule to make the investment worthwhile an 
investor should plan to let his or her money accumulate in the 
annuity for at least 10 years

the enormous sudden costly american military 
buildup in the mideast gives an idea of the magnitude of some other 
big numbers such as budget deficits 
it is a measuring stick that is for budgetary and other 
financial items so large as to be almost meaningless to many 
people simply because they have no way of matching those numbers 
against other expenditures 
now they have a vivid picture of what can be done for a few 
billion dollars 
through september according to the pentagon american 
operations in the persian gulf will add about 25 billion to 
normal military operating costs a figure big by any method of 
calculation 
for that price the military will transport and make 
battleready more than 100000 personnel and thousands of fighter 
planes bombers tankers transports helicopters radar tanks 
artillery rockets ammuniton 
that sum pays for aircraft carriers hospitals hospital ships 
medicines minesweepers destroyers amphibious tracked vehicles 
food kitchens fuel equipment living quarters special clothing 
intelligence operations 
the cost of the entire incredible almost inconceivably 
intricate operation is peanuts however when matched against the 
way america can waste money as in the savings and loan fiasco and 
in routine everyday waste by government 
six years ago for example the presidents private sector 
survey on cost control chaired by business executive j peter 
grace recommended a threeyear program of spending reductions and 
efficiencies totaling 424 billion 
instead of cutting congress in the very next year raised 
federal spending by 945 billion or nearly 38 times the estimated 
cost of the first two months of the mideast military buildup 
late last year the general accounting office issued its 
congressionally mandated annual report on federal financial 
management it found more than 150 billion in program waste fraud 
and financial mismanagement 
the problems that exist are not limited to a few agencies or a 
few programs said comptroller general charles a bowsher 
rather all of the major agencies have serious problems 
each year the congressional budget office must recommend budget 
options for senate and house budget committees this year it 
suggested reforms to yield 60 billion in savings during the first 
year agreement hasnt been reached 
unlike the mideast buildup funds budgeted by government 
sometimes serves no national purpose and produce no practical 
results 
scott hodge a fellow of the conservative heritage foundation 
says he has identified more than 130 billion of spending cuts and 
budget savings that could be made without harming basic and 
necessary social programs 
but congress he says has an addiction to creating programs and 
to pork barrel spending individually many of these programs might 
seem innocuous and thus escape criticism but when they 
proliferate the costs do too 
here are a few added to the budget in recent years creation of 
a national center for the study of weeds subsidies to develop the 
commercialization of new mexico wildflowers a removal of the 
250000 limit on honey subsidies 
murray weidenbaum former chief economic adviser to president 
reagan recently completed a book on the subject of budget deficits 
and congressional spending he thinks 100 billion should be cut 
from the budget right now 
such thinking however doesnt seem to constitute practical 
politics at least the way the game is played these days 
weidenbaum now director of the center for the study of american 
business at washington university in st louis would begin by 
lopping 25 billion from farm subsidies but he seems to think it 
wont be done 
at present we have to admit that there is little public 
support for budget cuts he says explaining that all the 
average citizen reads or hears about are the pleas of the spending 
agencies and their beneficiaries 
what agency or interest group he asks is going to pay for an 
ad to proclaim that its pet program is wasteful or even funded too 
generously 
measured against the 150 billion in program waste fraud and 
financial mismanagement as found by the general accounting office 
the mideast buildup seems like a bargain

signs of the times may be telling american roman catholics that 
they dont need so many priests and that lay people should take 
over more church responsibilites an analyst of the situation says 
the theory is put forward by the rev eugene hemrick research 
director for the nations catholic bishops in the face of a new 
study indicating the priesthood is headed into a steep decline 
maybe we had too many priests in the past he said 
theres much more relying on lay people than before which could 
be a good thing that may be why all this is happening 
the study projects that in 15 years the number of active 
diocesan priests will have shrunk to 21030 in this country that 
would be a 40 percent drop from a peak of 35070 in 1966 
theres no doubt about it were in for a dramatic drop 
said hemrick who works in washington dc 
the drop in priests looms as the number of american catholics 
increases from the current 57 million to an estimated 70 million 
by 2005 at the same time parishes without priests are 
multiplying now numbering more than 1000 
many parishes now are run by lay pastoral administrators or 
nuns filling that role with that practice spreading the bishops 
issued guidelines last fall for sunday worship without priests 
richard schoenherr a sociologist at the university of wisconsin 
who oversaw the study on the priesthood suggested lifting the 
requirement of celibacy for priests might slow the decline in 
numbers 
a growing majority of priests themselves and the catholic 
people say they would welcome a married priesthood he said 
since a priest is required to consecrate the bread and wine of 
holy communion people are beginning to complain that their 
participation in that sacrament is being lost schoenherr said 
however henrick disagreed that would happen 
he said consecrated elements can be reserved and taken for 
distribution to congregations without priests or perhaps 
circuittraveling priests can consecrate and reserve elements for 
subseqeuent use by such congregations 
we have lay ministers who administer communion he said 
thats one of the new movements in the church lay eucharistic 
ministers distribute the sacrament they take it to people in 
hospitals and prisons 
before this was the role only of priests 
the clerically centered and priestrun parish is changing he 
said lay people are working sidebyside with the pastor there 
is much more sharing in major decisions than before and involvement 
of lay people 
noting that this was one of the objectives of the second vatican 
council of 196265 in defining the church as the people of god 
he said 
i say let the trend of fewer priests go on and see where it 
takes us maybe god is calling us to it if it doesnt stand the 
test of time we can go in another direction 
hemrick said that allowing optional celibacy for priests 
might boost their numbers but it would create more problems than 
it would solve 
the idea of beefing up numbers getting more priests by hook 
or crook is a throwback to the way things used to be he said 
its almost like flouting the movement that is taking place now 
of fewer priests working more closely with the laity 
hemrick said there is some resistance from church members to the 
changes wrought by the lack of priests and it is likely to 
increase its hard to change peoples perceptions they want to 
hold on to tradition on which they were brought up he said 
but the study which was commissioned by the us bishops 
points clearly to a continued decline and to a very slim 
priesthood in the future 
the 165page report prepared by researchers at the university 
of wisconsin and brigham young university and financed by the lilly 
endowment has not been made public but a copy was provided to 
catholic news service 
it quotes the report as saying that the decrease in priestly 
ordinations is the most significant factor in the overall clergy 
decline far more significant than resignations retirements or 
other factors 
bishop donald wuerl of pittsburgh chairman of the bishops 
committee on priestly life and ministry says the findings will be 
considered by the bishops administrative committee that is to meet 
in washington sept 1113 
although schoenherr said catholics are worried about being 
deprived of communion by lack of priests hemrick said history 
shows that when the numbers of priests have been reduced by 
persecution for example ways are found to keep communion 
available to everyone 
that was the case in eastern europe he said where priests 
had to go underground but kept celebrating communion in homes or 
secluded places but they survived

relaxed relations with the 
soviet union have allowed the north american aerospace defense 
command to shift more of its resources to another threat south 
american drug smugglers 
but norads commander gen donald j kutyna believes that 
every time the united states ups the ante the cocaine cartel will 
counter with money and stealth 
the way youre going to stop the drug war is at the user 
level youre not going to stop it at the interdiction level 
said kutyna a fourstar general and vietnam veteran who assumed 
command of norad in april 
remember the ho chi minh trail well we bombed them the 
north vietnamese we napalmed them everything else in the whole 
world we still couldnt stop them 
the druggie is always going to find an innovative way to get 
in were going to make it tougher for them were going to make it 
more costly were going to deter some by putting them in jail but 
the price of that stuff is high enough that theyre smugglers 
going to keep trying 
norad is a joint united statescanadian command headquartered at 
peterson air force base and inside the topsecret cheyenne mountain 
global eavesdropping complex both at colorado springs their 
listening posts span the globe and extend into space 
in a recent interview kutyna said that involving his troops in 
the drug war has boosted morale and sharpened skills 
it gives us a lot of good practice that we werent getting 
before said kutyna before we had to hire lear jets or t33s 
to fly as enemy intruder targets now weve got real targets out 
there who are really trying to evade us as if their life depends on 
it theyre a lot more motivated 
so our crews are scrambling at them several scrambles a day 
something like 51 actual intercepts this year its keeping 
our crews sharper sitting at alert for hour after hour day 
after day is kind of dull he said 
its very good for morale i think probably my highest morale 
troops are the guys involved with drug interdiction from the 
intelligence segment to the pilots flying intercepts to the guys 
working in radar because were really doing something worthwhile 
among its assets in the drug war norad has 41 ground radar 
sites in the continental united states and 13 in alaska tethered 
aerostats radar balloons in florida and the southwest about 60 
fighter planes at 30 alert locations and a fleet of e3 airborne 
warning and control system awacs planes 
before iraq invaded kuwait 42 percent of the air forces awacs 
missions were flown against potential drug smugglers nearly three 
weeks after the invasion a norad spokesman said that percentage 
was still about the same 
thats a very costly way of chasing druggies said kutyna 
who favors a broader groundbased overlapping radar net the 
experimental overthehorizon backscatter radar system 
i cant get congress to fund it i dont know if its 
politics or just a matter of money but they have declared that 
the drug war is over we dont have to worry about it anymore and 
therefore we dont need it 
kutyna said drug smugglers have switched their main route into 
the united states from the caribbean to mexico 
sixty to 70 percent of the drug traffic now coming into the 
states is through mexico said kutyna at first they used to 
fly right up through mexico and across our border weve precluded 
that with awacs patrols there weve got radar on balloons so 
weve kind of shut down the border much better than it was before 
though they can still sneak through every once in a while 
the 1989 national defense authorization act assigned the defense 
department as the frontline agency in the fight against the drug 
barons initially the pentagon resisted involvement in the 
domestic war but as the cold war wound down the military 
increasingly warmed to the new battle front 
this fiscal year the defense department will spend an estimated 
450 million against drug smugglers next year 12 billion is 
budgeted 
still they have their work cut out for them military experts 
estimate that about 220000 tons of cocoa leaves are grown in 
andean rain forests every year and that between 3000 and 5000 
sea trips and up to 3500 aircraft flights annually bring cocaine 
to as many as 3 million american users 
federal law prohibits the military from arresting smugglers or 
firing upon them the norad crews can intercept planes and force 
them to turn back or track them until they land and tip off other 
law enforcement agencies as to their whereabouts 
we werent sure it was our mission from the beginning and 
then we got to flying and people said yes that is our mission 
and we take it on with great enthusiasm now and we certainly 
believe it is right i wouldnt call it a military threat but 
drugs are certainly a threat to our national well being our 
national security

in the twilight of the typewriter as ibm sells 
its selectric division and secretaries trade their trusty electrics 
for word processors the old man known as mr typewriter is all 
keyed up 
were getting more work than we can handle says martin 
tytell 76 whose tytell typewriter co and questioned document 
laboratory has identified made and repaired typewriters for 
everyone from the fbi to alger hiss 
the other day a tribe of indians in british colombia asked him 
to make the first typewriter in their language and in the past 
month hes sold eight romanian typewriters a japanese company 
opening a plant in a region of china with irregular electrical 
power wants 20 manuals in phonetic japanese 
there are calls from companies trying to track down the authors 
of anonymous memos from lawyers wondering if a will typed out on a 
proportional spacing electric could really have been drawn up in 
1950 
tytell and company his wife pearl and their 45yearold son 
peter are ready for virtually any typographic challenge 
they have the worlds largest collection of type about 2 
million pieces representing 145 different languages and dialects 
including syriac a virtually dead language that dates from the 
time of christ and old english 
they have about 400 assembled typewriters in various languages 
including several in hindi and siamese ready for sale 
they have a type and typewriter reference library that helps 
them to determine sometimes for the information of the police if 
a document could have been typed on a particular typewriter on a 
particular date 
but their greatest asset is their experience they can tell a 
selectric ii from a selectric iii by the length of the underscore 
line they know that if the dot on an i is slightly to the 
left it was typed on an lc smith manual that an 8 with a 
small projection at the top came from an underwood model 8 
he has made or repaired machines for dwight eisenhower adlai 
stevenson and andy rooney he has made a typewriter for onearmed 
typists and a machine with nothing but question marks for a client 
who tytell recalls may or may not have been sane 
martin tytells interest in typewriters dates back to high 
school he would regularly take apart the old underwood in the 
physical education office and the repairman would regularly have 
to put it back together finally the expert let tytell in on a few 
secrets and soon the youngster could reassemble the machine 
blindfolded 
he started his own repair shop before world war ii and hired 
pearl who became his wife five years later when martin was 
drafted the army put him to work making typewriters in the many 
languages used in the wars many theaters the war ended but not 
the need for unusual typewriters 
in 1950 tytell was hired to buttress a claim by accused spy 
alger hiss that he was the victim of forgery by typewriter 
hiss lawyers posed the ultimate challenge duplicate the famous 
woodstock n230099 on which documents that incriminated hiss had 
been typed 
for the thenenormous sum of 7500 tytell worked for months to 
create such a machine in the end a judge ruled that tytells 
effort was less than a perfect duplicate a verdict the machines 
creator questions 
by the late 1950s tytells fame was such that the post office 
routinely delivered mail addressed merely mr typewriter new 
york to his dusty cramped officelabwarehouseworkshop near 
wall street 
there steel shelves reaching to the 11foot ceilings are filled 
with typewriters spare parts boxes of type and equipment ranging 
from microscopes to blowtorches 
three years ago the floor began to collapse so the tytells 
rented another space around the corner the family collection 
extends uptown to peters onebedroom apartment which shelters 
about 130 typewriters but a lot of them are portables he 
explains 
on a recent morning the clan gathered to discuss their favorite 
subject martins long white lab coat matched his moustache and 
hair pearl wears her hair wrapped around her head in a braid 
peter looked scholarly with his wireframe glasses droopy 
moustache and necktie decorated with type faces 
they are three intelligent experienced and informed people who 
love their work and love to talk about it usually all at once 
when peter who launched into a history of the typewriter 
mentioned that queen anne granted the first patent for a writing 
machine in 1714 his father jumped in to correct the date 1713 
he said as well as the patent number 
the interview was suspended as father and son began pulling 
reference and history books from the shelves finally peter located 
a history of typewriters in german that proved him right and ended 
the argument 
so it went for several hours martin began a story pearl broke 
in to elaborate he wandered off in search of some book to buttress 
his own point peter cut in on his mother who also headed off to 
photocopy some relevant document eventually martin returned to 
interrupt peter and pick up the thread of the conversation 
here distilled is one of their favorite typewriter cases 
anonymous typewritten letters were being sent to the residents 
of an affluent long island suburb accusing a young doctor of 
running an abortion mill the doctors practice suffered 
associates and acquaintances cut him off his daughter was insulted 
at school 
tytell knew he could identify the typewriter because in each 
note the i key slanted to the left and the u was dented 
and he suspected the notes were the work of a former nurse 
posing as a typewriter repairman and offering a free 
introductory machine cleaning tytell talked his way into the homes 
of several suspects but did not find the right typewriter 
as the tytells reread the letters however mrs tytell had a 
hunch the writer had accused the doctors wife of being a poor 
housekeeper that pearl decided sounded like a jealous relative 
the next day martin went to the office where the doctors sister 
worked as a stenographer there sitting on her desk was the 
machine the letters stopped after she was confronted with the 
evidence 
but today the computer printer is replacing the typewriter as 
the favored instrument of whitecollar crime extortion ransom and 
blackmail 
the explosion in printer production and technology has sent 
peter scurrying around the country to printer manufacturing plants 
and computer sales shows filled his apartment with stacks of 
computer journals and periodicals embroiled him in a work week 
that often stretches to 75 hours 
to the forger or poison pen the printer offers new 
possibilities where once typewriter sleuths could realistically 
hope to match a typewritten document to a typewriter with a unique 
typeface and key stroke now a laser printer has several 
resident typefaces and accepts a cartridge with additional ones 
computer printers also are harder to read than typewriters 
because they dont deteriorate as quickly and develop distinctive 
flaws and because they tend to shut down entirely when a problem 
does develop 
in his more sanguine moments peter tells himself the printer is 
merely another cycle another swing of the pendulum and that 
the basic laws of document identification havent changed but he 
adds if i dont take that attitude ill be reduced to a mass of 
jello

four months ago someone painted a small 
rustyred swastika on a stone pillar a few steps from the israeli 
ambassadors home 
he drives by it every day neighbors walk dogs past it children 
play nearby no one has tried to obliterate the ugly symbol 
graffiti and other signs of antisemitism are being seen again 
in poland even though it is nearly bereft of jews and the 
prejudice of the streets has begun to infiltrate politics 
some rightist politicians are fanning nationalist emotions and 
with a seeming inevitability antisemitism 
on the other side prominent anticommunist figures like adam 
michnik editor of the newspaper gazeta wyborcza and zbigniew 
bujak both leaders of the progovernment democratic action party 
have been sounding the alarm 
solidarity chairman lech walesa indignant at suggestions of 
bigotry on the part of himself or some of his followers declared 
lech walesa is not and will not be antisemitic 
in a resolution july 29 walesas national citizens committee 
condemned both prejudice and the use of unfounded charges of 
antisemitism to smear political opponents members of the 
committee have accused foreign journalists of exaggerating the 
extent of antisemitism in poland 
the late sociologist aleksander hertz a polish jew said 
antisemitism grew in the 19th century in response to polands 
humiliating partitions russian influences and the prosperity of a 
burgeoning jewish population which both the declining aristocracy 
and impoverished peasants resented 
in politics antisemitism peaked just before world war ii when 
it was a major tenet of the popular national democrats university 
students hounded jewish colleagues and antisemites organized 
boycotts of jewish businesses 
three million polish jews were killed by the nazis some of the 
halfmillion who survived owed their lives to poles who hid them 
but others were betrayed by polish acquaintances 
polish jews who lived through the holocaust were traumatized by 
it and feared trying to reclaim homes and property from christians 
particularly after a pogrom in 1946 that took 48 lives in kielce 
most of them emigrated to israel or the united states 
an official communist purge of zionists prompted the last 
big wave of emigration in 1968 reducing the number of jews to 
500015000 in a nation of 38 million people 
for the first time in centuries poland is without a large 
jewish population and profound changes have resulted 
before the war jews were about 10 percent of the population 
concentrated in towns and cities and made up a large part of the 
middle class the landed aristocracy disdained commerce and 
peasants stuck to their farms so much of the small business trade 
and industry were left to jews 
half a century after nazi occupation poland still has not come 
to grips with the loss of its jewish population any discussion of 
jews is likely to provoke strong emotions often defensive 
polands only rabbi pinchas menachem joskowicz said he had 
noticed more antisemitism recently he used to find respect and 
friendliness when he walked the streets in his traditional orthodox 
garb joskowicz said but now encounters hostility 
two weeks ago i had guests from israel and we went for a 
walk he said in an interview then youths maybe 21 maybe 
younger started shouting jews to palestine and other slogans 
too i did not pay any attention let them shout 
but when we walked a few meters they approached us and started 
hitting one of the guests 
joskowicz said he now avoids walking at night and does not know 
what to tell jews from abroad when they ask him if it is safe to 
visit poland 
there is a tendency to blame jews for the nations troubles 
i keep hearing that a gang has gotten to the feeding trough 
they are probably jews and they are destroying us walesa told a 
meeting of his national citizens committee on june 24 
he said such remarks do not mean antisemitism is increasing 
but that the government must do a better job of explaining itself 
to the people 
farmers who occupied the agriculture ministry in june demanding 
guaranteed prices were heard muttering about the jewish 
government 
that government is led by a devout roman catholic prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki who identifies with 
christiandemocratic politics and sometimes is accused of being too 
solicitous of the church 
allegations that jews run the government rest on the fact that 
some prominent solidarity politicians are jews two examples are 
michnik and parliament member bronislaw geremek leader of the 
citizens parliamentary club who are of jewish descent but do not 
practice the religion 
communist functionaries used such information in the past in the 
vain hope of discrediting solidarity 
in august the national party a farright group based in the 
southern city of krakow said it was unfair for an ethnic minority 
to have dominance in the government the grunwald society created 
by nationalistic communists contended recently that german and 
jewish chauvinists were the greatest threats to polish 
sovereignty 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska who wrote a 
book on the remaining jews in poland with her husband a 
photographer said antisemitism is coming to the surface in the 
more liberal atmosphere since communist rule 
now everything is free she said many good things have 
come out but also some bad things 
some antisemitism is present in all countries she said and 
i hope it will be marginal in poland too for the future because 
its visible it can be fought

president rodrigo borja halfway through 
his term has not convinced the people he can solve ecuadors 
economic problems and faces the added burden of a hostile congress 
annual inflation of 50 percent spurs discontent and many 
analysts say borjas last two years may be a time of paralyzing 
political confrontation his democratic left party lost its 
congressional majority in june 
i greatly fear the new legislature will devote itself to 
waging war on the government which in turn will defend itself like 
a wounded animal with every weapon available alejandro carrion 
a respected columnnist wrote in the magazine vistaso 
all is not bleak however ecuador exports oil and higher 
prices resulting from the middle east crisis could produce an 
economic bonanza for the government said fernando santos 
energy minister under borjas rightwing predecessor leon febres 
cordero 
oil is a government monopoly and provides nearly 50 percent of 
public revenue in ecuador a small andean nation of 10 million 
people borja based this years budget on an average price of 15 a 
barrel but fluctuating prices since iraq occupied kuwait on aug 2 
have reached more than twice that 
borja took office in august 1988 three months after winning a 
runoff with populist abdala bucaram febres cordero could not run 
again because presidents are allowed only one term in ecuador 
febres cordero left a stagnant economy and record annual 
inflation of 88 percent for most of the 1980s inflation had 
averaged less than 30 percent 
the new president pledged to cut inflation in half before the 
end of his first year but the figure dropped only to 547 percent 
this year he renewed the promise to halve inflation but the 
annual rate continues to run above 50 percent independent 
economists predict it will level out at 40 percent by years end 
experts blame borjas restrictive spending policies for slow 
economic growth the central bank says the economy grew only 04 
percent in 1989 
his government rejected a shock anttinflation program of 
the type favored by the international monetary fund preferring 
gradual measures like small currency devaluations and energy price 
increases introduced weekly 
analysts say the repeated increases in gasoline and electricity 
prices contributed to the governing democratic lefts crushing 
defeat in the june 17 congressional elections 
it retained only 14 of its 30 seats and lost the majority it had 
forged in the onehouse legislature through an alliance with a 
minor party 
among the parties gaining ground was febres corderos 
conservative social christian party which increased its membership 
in the 72seat chamber from seven to 16 
bucarams ecuadorean roldosista party won 13 seats an increase 
of five and the socialist party a marxist group doubled its 
presence to eight 
bucaram and febres cordero have promised borja will face tough 
going in the new congress which convened aug 10 and immediately 
demanded that seven of his 12 cabinet members resign 
among those on the list was the agriculture minister blamed by 
the opposition for recurring food shortages and the education 
minister accused of embezzling funds from a literacy campaign 
andres vallejo a former interior minister appointed central 
bank president in july is another target the opposition claims he 
persecuted critics while in charge of the interior ministry which 
controls the police 
by recent ecuadorean standards borjas first two years were 
tranquil 
febres cordero his fierytempered predecessor had to battle a 
hostile congress with a leftist majority led by borjas party 
he put down two attempted coups in 1986 and a year later was 
kidnapped by air force paratroopers and forced to pardon the air 
force commander who led the coup attempts 
congress then tried to impeach him without success

when 40 million youngsters return to 
public school this fall it will cost an average of 5638 each to 
educate them 
you might call beth ann brown the 500000 student 
beth ann a profoundly handicapped 21yearold her parents 
and wilson county school district outside nashville are locked in a 
tragic legal duel to decide who should pay for her phenomenally 
expensive care and whether that care is really medical or 
educational 
if she wins as she well might the county will owe her a sum 
equal to more than onefourth of its entire special education 
budget of just under 2 million which serves nearly 1300 
handicapped children 
it would also add to a recent string of court decisions 
mandating more special education spending cases which a growing 
number of educators say threaten to squeeze regular education 
budgets and erode support for educating the nations 43 million 
handicapped children 
beth anns sad case also points up failures of state governments 
to share responsibility with local districts and the mounting 
consequences of the federal governments refusal to provide funds 
it promised for special education services it mandated 15 years ago 
beth ann brown a slight young woman with short brown hair 
uncertain gait and frightened eyes was born brain damaged on march 
9 1969 she was left with a speech defect cerebral palsy and an 
emotional disability so severe that normal school has been all but 
impossible most of her life 
from kindergarten on her behavior grew more bizarre and 
unmanageable she was given to unpredictable and violent outbursts 
she swallowed hairspray thumbtacks and clothing banged her head 
used profane language and engaged publicly in inappropriate sexual 
behavior according to court records 
tests show she is borderline retarded says her lawyer gary 
buchanan 
for years beth anns parents and wilson school officials had 
worked hard and until recently amicably searching for an 
appropriate place for her 
she spent much of her life in seven different psychiatric 
hospitals or mental health centers in tennessee and pennsylvania 
her fathers insurance picked up 90 percent of the cost the school 
district paid the rest 
she made no progress and in fact worsened according to her 
parents 
since 1985 she has run away from two centers spent three 
heavily drugged months at a psychiatric hospital received 
homebound instruction attended classes at a vocational training 
center nothing worked 
beth anns last 18 months have been happier but at a 
staggering cost 
since feb 15 1989 she has led a sheltered life at cedarbrook 
academy a lush 690day residential center specializing in 
braindamage victims in gallatin tenn about 20 miles northeast 
of nashville drugs and psychotherapy add as much as 700 to 800 
more to her monthly costs 
her parents and behavior therapists now say that for the first 
time in her life shes making progress controlling her outbursts 
her curriculum includes music recreation therapy speech 
language arts math social interaction skills and health 
education in june she received grades of c in language arts 
and ds in math social skills and health but her report card 
noted overall progress somewhat higher than the grades would 
indicate 
her attention span has increased from about three minutes to as 
much as 30 minutes she is learning to count change she is even 
learning to type though her speed is only about one word per 
minute 
she herself says shes finally learning to get a grip on her 
volatile emotions enough she hopes to attend regular school 
someday 
i really like it here she told a visitor what i like 
best is the people they dont just look at you professionally 
they really care about you 
despite her retardation she can be articulate curious and 
assertive in calm moments she talked animatedly about the rock 
group new kids on the block and her special fondness for 
country music singer gary morris she admits to occasional 
homesickness 
but her volatility still requires therapists to be at her elbow 
virtually 24 hours a day 
and her life at cedarbrook has been clouded ever since her 
fathers group insurance plan switched carriers some 18 months ago 
the new carrier decided that the care beth ann was getting at 
cedarbrook was educational not medical they stopped paying 
the browns turned to wilson county to pick up the tab the 
county refused offering beth ann more homebound instruction 
instead 
beth ann and her parents sued 
we were doing everything for beth ann we possibly could 
said mike dover wilson countys director of special education 
but with this last placement i finally said no these 
placements simply werent working we felt she had a mental health 
problem 
but middle tennessee district court judge thomas a higgins 
sided with beth ann he issued a summary judgment on april 18 
ordering wilson county to pay 31342834 for her care at 
cedarbrook retroactive to may 1 1989 
wilson countys bill would exceed 500000 by june 1 1991 when 
beth ann is 22 and no longer qualifies for special education 
under recently enacted special education rules the district 
would also have to pay beth anns legal bills currently amounting 
to 1312830 
the county is appealing if it loses county taxpayers already 
incensed over an accumulated 15 million school budget deficit 
may face a tax increase dover said 
the core issue raised by beth ann and thousands like her across 
the country isnt whether theyre legally entitled to such intense 
and costly care 
the real dilemma is who should pay 
at the heart of the matter is the increasingly murky legal 
distinction between what is educational and what is medical 
the 1975 federal education for all handicapped children act 
which established the right of disabled fiveto22yearolds to a 
free appropriate public education also required public 
schools to provide what are called related services 
such nonclassroom services are meant to redress handicaps that 
directly interfere with learning they commonly include special 
modes of transportation speech therapy and physical and 
occupational therapy 
but recent court rulings have greatly expanded the range of such 
services to include virtually any medical procedure that does not 
clearly require a doctor to administer them a landmark 1984 
supreme court ruling requires schools to provide catheterization to 
a child with spina bifida for example 
a decision last november further stretched the bounds of special 
education beyond all reason some educators contend 
in timothy vs rochester nh the us supreme court let stand 
a ruling obligating school districts to provide education to all 
children regardless of the potential benefit 
the ruling compelled the rochester school district to pay 
15000 a year to educate a 14yearold who was blind and deaf had 
cerebral palsy was virtually immobile and was so mentally 
impaired that the only apparent evidence of intellectual potential 
was that he responded to bright light smiled when happy and cried 
when sad

educators previously afraid of sounding heartless now openly 
warn of a possible taxpayer backlash as regular education budgets 
are pinched by mounting special education costs forcing tax 
increases 
cases like this bring about a schizophrenia our hearts tell 
us to do something but our common sense tells us that there are 
limits said thomas a shannon executive director of the 
national school boards association which filed a brief in support 
of the rochester school district 
according to a cost analysis done for congress last april by the 
national association of state directors of special education total 
education spending in new york state rose 901 percent from 
198088 but special education spending increased by 1864 percent 
in 1980 special education accounted for 11 percent of all 
expenditures in 1988 it had increased to 166 percent 
other states surveyed reported similar figures in florida 
total education spending rose 1254 percent compared with 2102 
percent for handicapped youngsters in 1980 special education 
amounted to 81 percent of all education spending but rose to 112 
percent eight years later 
and new costs are just around the corner 
in 1986 congress passed a law entitling handicapped 
preschoolers as young as 3 to public education starting in 1991 
any state that doesnt provide such services risks losing federal 
special ed funds 
special educators accuse the federal government of being quick 
to heap evergreater responsibilities on school districts but slow 
to fund them 
the 1975 act envisioned that the federal government would pay 40 
percent of the total bill but washington never provided more than 
14 percent and has contributed less than 10 percent throughout the 
1980s 
the law also called on state mental health social service 
vocational rehabilitation and education departments to cooperate in 
funding and providing special education services 
a few states notably maryland and illinois are pooling 
resources from various state agencies to help fund services for 
handicapped kids but such cooperation remains rare said william 
schipper executive director of the national association of state 
directors of special education 
adding to the fiscal strain on local districts the current 
trend of deinstitutionalization has placed thousands of youngsters 
once consigned to state mental hospitals into the care of public 
schools 
school districts wind up holding the bag getting little or no 
help from state agencies said melinda maloney managing editor 
of the special educator a semimonthly journal that tracks 
special education cases 
until a child is 22 the other state agencies can say to 
school districts tough its your problem and the judges dont 
care who is paying they just enforce the law she said 
dover says wilson county officials have pleaded with various 
state agencies for financial help for beth ann so far to no avail 
buchanan beth anns attorney says he is confident she will win 
the right to stay at cedarbrook at public expense 
whats the alternative throw beth ann brown out on the 
street he asked in all honesty there was just no 
alternative

the bells that toll to open american schools 
this month also proclaim the arrival of something new and 
troublesome the first big wave of children exposed to crack in 
the womb 
many of these kids now entering preschool and kindergarten 
classes have special needs and most schools are not ready to 
deal with them 
with few exceptions i dont think that schools are prepared 
to handle this issue im thinking programwise as well as 
financially said samuel sava head of the national association 
of elementary school principals 
children who were exposed in utero to crack other forms of 
cocaine and other drugs can exhibit a wide range of symptoms 
including tremors hyperactivity listlessness and the inability to 
organize their thinking 
many do not fit any special education or disability category 
and health professionals fear teachers are not being equipped to 
handle their neurological emotional and learning problems 
all agree that their exposure to drugs coupled with unsettled 
home lives mean that these children need help 
if solid earlychildhood education is not provided these 
children may not survive said joan altshuler an education 
diagnostician with the hillsborough county fla schools which is 
working to teach these children 
each year an estimated 375000 american children are born 
having been exposed to cocaine and other drugs while in the womb 
of those about 200000 are believed to have traces of crack in 
their system at birth 
no one knows exactly how many of these kids are about to enter 
school when the incoming kindergarten and preschool class was 
born the numbers of crack babies were smaller the epidemic was 
in its early stages 
but educators say it is clear that the number of crack kids is 
about to take a quantum leap and those numbers will escalate in 
coming years 
we are just now beginning to recognize how we must work with 
these children said sava noting that studies show drugexposed 
youngsters may soon comprise 40 percent to 60 percent of innercity 
school populations 
some districts are preparing educators in fulton county ga 
spent the summer providing teacher training workshops focused on 
these children 
ohio has formed a special task force on drugexposed infants 
with the goal of completing a resource center by 1992 los angeles 
has a pioneering special education program in place for 
drugexposed kids 
hillsborough county intends to educate these kids in regular 
classes kindergarten teachers will attend workshops to help them 
identify drugexposed youngsters and to learn how best to teach 
them 
teachers are taught to use masking tape to create work spaces on 
tables glue footprints on the floor to show line up areas and 
tack a calendar at a childs eyelevel so children can know what 
activities to expect 
altshuler said most drugexposed youngsters are not well 
organized and can be easily confused by having too many things 
going on at once they require structure to overcome the chaotic 
and transient nature of the drug environment in which many still 
live 
care also must be taken not to overstimulate them because they 
might misbehave or be too overwhelmed to focus in on any one 
task 
teachers are asked not to put too many things on the walls to 
limit the number of books and games piled on shelves and to have 
activities planned for virtually every minute of the day 
these children cant wait they need to know what to do it 
may be get a book and look at it and then well go to lunch 
they cant have any lags in their day teachers have to be on at 
all times altshuler said 
she acknowledged theres nothing earthshaking about these 
suggestions and that the techniques would not adversely affect 
other students 
philosophically we want these children to stay in regular 
education were not talking about children with tremendous 
physical neurological and mental disabilities she said 
sam is one of those children he has eye problems and trouble 
retaining what he has learned one day he will count the next day 
he will forget how 
he is 5 years old and he is one of seven students in the 
graduating class at the operation par child development and family 
guidance center in st petersburg sam is energetic he loves the 
center and he responds eagerly to the staffs quick hugs and ready 
smiles 
at first its difficult to tell that sam and his 5yearold 
friend tom who has difficulty controlling his emotions have 
developmental problems that will require them to spend some time in 
special education after graduation 
many of the kids have learned the alphabet and numbers through 
music sam and tom bounce right along to the reggae beat of the 
blaring music as teacher alice bradley sings out the numbers 
printed on cards they hold 
these children arent different than any other children 
except for the mood swings said teacher eula hollaway 
the center opened in june 1988 mainly to provide free child 
care for women seeking help with drug addiction but it soon became 
a vital part of these childrens lives and program director 
shirley davis worries about their future once they enter public 
schools 
florida has the highest dropout rate in the country as it is 
were going to send them off to school and im not sure were going 
to put them in places where people will really attend to the 
problems that these kids have and that they will really work on 
these children she said 
teachers may hear the words cocaine baby and they have this 
preconceived notion that these children cannot learn and therefore 
we dont teach them 
sometimes i get really upset when educators come to us and 
say what do they look like davis said when you see these 
children they look like everybody they are our children we 
want them to look like quasimodo so we can label them and put them 
over in the corner 
operation par president shirley coletti who founded the program 
20 years ago when she learned one of her four teenagers was 
experimenting with drugs says its important to talk about 
hopefulness instead of hopelessness 
there is reason to believe that in time whatever disabilities 
these children have will subside she said 
i think its going to require a tremendous amount of training 
on the part of the prekindergarten kindergarten and firstgrade 
teachers we must have research dollars to do some longerterm 
studies otherwise i think youre going to see a lot of 
terribly discouraged teachers she said 
money is a major concern the florida department of human 
resources estimates that it would cost 40000 per child per year 
to provide all the services each child needs up to school age and 
no one has estimated the cost once the children are in school 
altshuler stressed that the government and other policymakers 
must take steps to reduce classroom size and provide other 
assistance for those teachers and educators who gripe about the 
responsibilities she has a simple message 
its your job to teach the child its your job to accept 
them the positives and negatives and concentrate on the strengths 
of the child and go from there we cant put everybody in special 
education so we better find what were going to do in our 
classrooms

by morning the storm had passed and the parking lot filled 
with people for the dedication ceremony the black plastic covering 
the monument was gone replaced by red white and blue bunting the 
speakers platform groaned under the weight of dignitaries and the 
23rd army band played rousing military tunes 
paul tibbets rose to speak and the crowd gave him a standing 
ovation at 75 he is hard of hearing and walks stiffly but he 
held their respect as if he still were their commanding officer 
be not ashamed for bombing hiroshima and nagasaki he told those 
gathered nuclear weaponry has caused peace to reign for 45 
years he said 
the united states was fighting a war against an entrenched 
enemy he said if allied forces had been forced to invade japan 
perhaps a million lives would have been lost he said compared 
with the estimated 180000 who died in hiroshima and nagasaki 
americans today often dont appreciate the sacrifices that 
ensured our present good fortune he said 
they dont want to exercise their brains by reading about what 
happened in those days well that leaves some of us to tell them 
what happened hopefully they will remember it he said 
then tibbets unveiled the memorial a 16foot granite obelisk 
supporting a bronze replica of the enola gay below was a plaque 
with the logo of the 509th composite group a lightning bolt and 
the phrase first atomic bombardment 
for a peace monument it was strikingly martial but then so 
was the ceremony little mention was made of the victims a 
japanese author had been scheduled to speak but he was quickly 
unscheduled the previous night along with the japanese national 
anthem after suggesting japan might have surrendered without the 
hiroshima and nagasaki bombings 
the rev william b downey 509th chaplain closed the ceremony 
with a dedicatory prayer 
we thank thee god for the atom bomb through which peace 
came to our world 
a squadron of jet fighters thundered overhead and the band 
struck up another tune tibbets and other crew members of the enola 
gay were corraled for pictures in front of the obelisk 
suddenly richard sherwood was there too smiling and shaking 
tibbets hand sherwood shouted a few words but tibbets could not 
hear above the crowd he gave sherwood a puzzled look then turned 
again toward the cameras 
for a moment the hawk and the dove stood together despite 
their differences they have a common bond in their conviction that 
the world must never forget the lessons of hiroshima and nagasaki 
but just what is that lesson 
peace comes through strength says tibbets 
peace comes through understanding says sherwood 
it is clear which message won this day tibbets was the hero 
sherwood was in the way a cameratoting woman shouted the crew 
just the crew and sherwood retreated into the crowd an observer 
once again

as millions of viewers grumble their way back 
from summer vacations nbcs today show armed with faith hope 
and a new set will attempt to rebound from the great debacle of 
198990 
the new set featuring a kitchen and large transparent 
photographs of various american scenes premieres monday 
as for the show its executive producer tom capra thinks the 
worst is over and the ratings slide halted since the june additions 
of faith daniels as news anchor and today returnee joe 
garagiola as a third coanchor working with bryant gumbel and 
deborah norville 
but not even capra predicts a quick return to the no 1 ratings 
status today lost to abcs good morning america in january 
after the exit of the popular jane pauley and the arrival of 
norville 
i think itll take quite a while said the producer who was 
brought in last january with seemingly simple marching orders 
fix it 
but nothing is simple in the world of the morning wars where a 
few ratings points can mean millions of dollars in losses or 
profits where revolvingdoor casting has jolted nbc and cbs into 
the headlines where abc glories in its resurrection while 
brandishing a new weapon a geography correspondent 
today hired garagiola to give the show a feeling of 
family again but even with the avuncular former catcher 
today suffered a summer week it would prefer to forget a 29 
rating its lowest in seven years 
it has edged upwards since then still today ratings for 
the period from january to midaugust are down 17 percent from last 
year according to nielsen those of good morning america rose 
by 10 percent and thirdplace cbs this morning also went up 
slightly by 4 percent 
one week in may cbs show traditionally the morning doormat 
even beat today in new york the nations largest tv market 
today had begun to slide in the ratings last summer before 
the elevation of norville first as the shows news reader then in 
january as coanchor with gumbel the perception by some viewers 
that the 32yearold norville had somehow muscled the 40yearold 
pauley aside made things worse 
in june nbc affiliates heard a frank we screwed up from nbc 
news chief michael gartner a month later he admitted the ratings 
slide may cost nbc 10 million and its affiliates an equal amount 
by years end 
when would today recapture the nielsen championship from its 
abc rival its going to be many months capra said 
he grinned you can lose an audience a lot faster than you can 
gain one we certainly have have proved that but we seem to have 
stopped the ratings hemorrhaging here 
with gumbel last month spending a week in saudi arabia 
anchoring his part of the show as part of nbcs coverage of the 
persian gulf crisis the ratings have settled out and are 
creeping ahead a little capra said 
but in the opinion of betsy frank senior vice president of 
saatchi amp saatchi advertising the worst isnt over yet for 
today 
it doesnt seem to have recovered she said yes she says 
the ratings rose in recent weeks as they have for the shows two 
network rivals but that is largely due to public interest in the 
persian gulf crisis 
she says the particular drama of what happened on the today 
show last winter should have passed by now yet its ratings have 
continued to decline while those of good morning america continue 
to grow 
erik sorenson executive producer of cbs this morning 
smells today blood were very much in striking distance and 
in some markets were actually beating them says sorenson 
his show debuted in november 1987 with the anchor team of harry 
smith and kathleen sullivan although but a tyke compared to the 
38yearold today and 15yearold good morning america the 
cbs show already has had its shakeups 
the major one was the replacement of sullivan by abc graduate 
paula zahn last february but the show also has added six new 
contributors including film reviewer gene siskel and sports 
reporter greg gumbel older brother of youknowwho 
the show now has more diversity in the segments than there 
used to be sorenson says there are more entertainment 
segments more celebrity segments and more pieces from 
contributors 
interestingly theres been some change over at good morning 
america there are fewer celebrity interviews even though the 
show is produced by abcs entertainment division not its news 
division 
we still do them but not tve done it in 
the past says jack reilly gmas executive producer 
the reason a star blur of sorts that has come with o the degree wethe 
growth 
of cable where celebrity interviewees are often found when not 
being grilled by connie chung barbara walters or a producer from 
entertainment tonight 
star interviews used to be much more exclusive to morning 
television 10 years ago reilly said 
but now you hear that arnold schwarzenegger has a new movie 
and you go where did i see him i dont know if i saw him on 
good morning america or entertainment tonight or cnns

whether just the latest advertising strategy or a 
genuine concern for driver safety us automakers are touting air 
bags motorized seat belts and antilock brakes in selling cars 
europeans carmakers have used safety as a sales pitch for years 
now that the federal government is ordering passive restraint 
systems in all usbuilt cars automakers believe it pays to 
advertise safety 
initially it was tough getting customers to talk about 
safety chrysler corp spokesman tony cervone said tuesday it 
becomes a discriminating factor in buying a car now 
chrysler which has trumpeted the planned production today of 
its one millionth airbag equipped car hits safety hard in radio 
advertisments calling the air bag an incentive that just might 
save your life 
air bags are standard in all model 1990 usbuilt cars at 
chrysler the first of the big three to commit to the device air 
bags for chryslers popular minivans are about two model years 
away cervone said 
general motors corp announced monday it will equip all 
usbuilt passenger cars with driversside air bags by the fall 
of 1995 but the company has yet to work them into safetyrelated 
advertising 
donald postma spokesman for gm technical staffs said the 
upscale cadillac division is expected to be the first to promote 
air bags 
ford motor co has air bags in about half its usbuilt 
vehicles but the company doesnt go to lengths to promote them or 
motorized passive restraint seat belts 
under federal law all cars made in the united states after 
sept 1 1989 must have either an air bag or automatic seat belt 
for drivers and frontseat passengers gms announcement to go with 
air bags reversed initial plans to install motorized seat belts in 
most of its cars 
according to insurance institute for highway safety in 
arlington va air bags were equipped in 1 percent of the 
estimated 10 million 1987 model cars sold in the united states 
including imports sold here by 1996 90 percent of cars are 
expected to have air bags the institute said 
european carmakers mercedes benz bmw and volkswagen long have 
incorporated safety promotion into advertising in part because 
buyers of their more expensive vehicles could be counted on to ask 
such questions 
when you deal with a small market niche such as ours is in the 
united states you have to be very attentive to what customers say 
they want in a car said john chuhran a spokesman for mercedes 
benz of north america in montvale nj 
in one 30second television commercial mercedes which sells 
about 75000 cars a year in the united states promotes its 
standard safety features 
of course you want a safe car for your family but what is 
safe well only your authorized mercedesbenz dealer offers a 
system with driversside air bag and antilock brakes on every 
new model standard thats safe the announcer says 
postma said gms initial objection to air bags was based on 
research showing that drivers would ignore manual seat belts which 
must be used in conjunction with an air bag to make the device 
effective 
what we are looking at now is that air bags have come of 
age postma said people indicate they want them we have 
worked on them enough so we know that they are reliable 
an air bag usually concealed in the steering wheel or beneath 
the drivers side dashboard inflates upon a headon impact or one 
30 degrees to the left or right of center of the steering wheel 
chrysler doesnt emphasize seatbelt use as a major part of its 
air bag promotion but cervone said an air bag is a supplemental 
safety device its there in all the advertising copy its not 
going to be the headline 
mercedes benzs chuhran said in terms of advertising safety 
is a relative term there is no such thing as an absolutely safe 
automobile

following the collapse of stotler group inc 
federal futures regulators are going to look into new ways for 
handling the liquidation of a brokerages customer accounts 
the commodity futures trading commission said tuesday it would 
develop procedures for how to handle bulk transfers or liquidations 
of customer accounts in unusual circumstances such as the cessation 
or suspension of a brokerages business 
such a rapid decline came last week as stotler group inc a 
firm once linked with former chicago board of trade chairman 
karsten cash mahlmann announced it was filing for liquidation 
under chapter 7 of the us bankruptcy code 
previously stotler group was forced into involuntary bankruptcy 
reorganization by some of the commodity funds it managed those 
funds claimed stotler owed them millions of dollars in unredeemed 
loans and investments 
on july 31 the cftc filed fraud charges against a stotler 
subsidiary stotler funds inc accusing it of misusing 5 million 
customer funds by lending it to the cashstrapped parent company 
a day later mahlmann resigned as head of stotler group and as 
chairman of the worlds largest futures exchange he has not been 
accused of any wrongdoing 
last week the cftc and the securities and exchange commission 
which oversees the stock and bond markets filed separate 
administrative actions against another stotler subsidiary stotler 
and co they accused the subsidiary of failing to maintain enough 
net capital the minimum amount of cash and assets to offset risks 
stotler and co settled the cftc action and late last week said 
it was offering to settle with the sec without admitting or denying 
any wrongdoing 
in a statement friday stotler president thomas m eagan said it 
was now in the best interests of all creditors that the further 
administration of these companies affairs be handled in an orderly 
manner by the bankruptcy court 
the cftcs trading and markets division which will research how 
such situations should be handled in the future is scheduled to 
present its findings next year 
the proposed rules change was announced at a regular cftc 
meeting to consider quarterly objectives

when they ask if you want light sweet in the 
oil trading business theyre not talking about a coffee break 
light sweet is a generic term that can be used for a variety of 
crude oils traded on the new york mercantile exchange a leading 
petroleum market although traders often erroneously refer to the 
mix as west texas intermediate or wti the benchmark us crude 
the mercantile exchange has sought to change this entrenched 
habit partly by insisting that traders use light sweet instead 
of wti but old ways die hard 
its wti said john lichtblau president of the petroleum 
industry research foundation in new york wti is the oil traded 
on the merc practically speaking it is wti 
advised of the mercs position on what the oil should be called 
lichtblau said any label used by the exchange is sort of 
irrelevant because traders in that market are only speculating 
on which direction oil prices will go 
like traders in other futures markets oil traders rarely take 
delivery of the actual oil but gamble on its price by buying and 
selling contracts for delivery in upcoming months 
these oilfutures contracts are commonly called paper 
barrels real oil on the other hand comes in what the industry 
calls wet barrels 
regardless of what theyre called merc traders have been buying 
and selling barrels of oil since 1983 when the exchange first 
offered a market in crude oil futures 
initially the merc listed 13 grades that it classified as light 
sweet crude the menu is now down to seven domestics and three 
foreign oils 
merc officials say the the most commonly traded light sweet 
crude was wti eventually the contract for other crudes also 
became known as wti 
confusion over what is sold has led to problems merc officials 
say some buyers who thought they were getting wti have discovered 
they were getting a different grade 
the errors have become a bigger headache for the merc officials 
recently as the iraqi invasion of kuwait sent oil prices into wild 
gyrations that thrust the merc into a largerthanusual public 
spotlight 
in an effort to clear up any misunderstanding the merc sent 
members a memo this week asking that they refer to light sweet 
crude instead of wti 
wti has for years been used as a reference point for measuring 
other crudes partly because it once was the most important grade 
of crude in the lower 48 states extracted from the permian basin 
in west texas but the industrys shifting exploration to other 
areas has made other grades just as prominent 
today alaskan north slope crude is the most important said 
bernard picchi a salomon brothers inc managing director who 
follows domestic oils a lot of people think wti is losing 
whatever relevance it once had in the industry because were just 
running out of the stuff 
the foreign oils that can be included in a merc contract are 
brent blend bonny light and oseberg the domestic crudes other 
than wti are mid continent sweet low sweet mix scurry snyder 
new mexican sweet north texas sweet oklahoma sweet and south 
texas sweet 
sweet refers to a crudes low sulphur content which is 
desirable because its less polluting and more cheaply refinable 
than socalled highsulphur sour grades 
light refers to a higher proportion of hydrogen compared 
with carbon with heavy oil often requiring an infusion of 
hydrogen before it can be refined picchi said 
for anyone confused by all of this the merc will soon have 
another item on the menu merc officials plan to begin trading on a 
sour oil contract in about a year

parties to meredith corps planned sale 
of its printing business to rr donnelley amp sons co say they are 
disappointed with continued government challenges to the nearly 
570 million transaction 
a federal judge this week rejected a federal trade commission 
request for an order blocking the sale pending an antitrust hearing 
by the ftc the ftc then said it would appeal 
the government raised the antitrust challenge after meredith and 
the burda family of west germany agreed last december to sell their 
jointly held meredithburda printing business to donnelley the 
leading commercial printer in north america 
donnelley was disappointed to learn that the ftc is appealing 
the courts decision the company said in a statement 
donnelley continues to believe that the acquisition is legally 
proper 
donnelley with 1989 sales of 312 billion has about 6 percent 
of the us market for the magazine catalog and newspaper insert 
business meredithburda has about 1 percent 
we continue to believe the transaction is both proper and 
legal meredith president jack rehm said 
meredith and the burdas agreed to sell the printing business for 
4875 million in cash donnelley also agreed to assume 80 million 
in meredithburda debt 
in july the ftc asked us district judge stanley harris in 
washington to issue an order blocking the sale pending the outcome 
of an antitrust hearing before the regulatory agency harris on 
monday refused to issue the preliminary injunction the ftc then 
said would appeal 
meredith has interests in publishing broadcasting and real 
estate and is best known for its better homes and gardens and 
ladies home journal magazines 
donnelley prints and binds many national publications including 
time newsweek and tv guide it also prints telephone books 
encyclopedias and school and religious books 
meredithburda was founded in 1969 and generated just over 10 
million in earnings for meredith in the fiscal year ended june 30 
meredith finished the the year with a 264 million loss 
reflecting onetime losses from the sale of discontinued television 
advertising and real estate businesses 
if the sale had been completed as planned merediths share of 
the proceeds would have offset the loss meredith said late last 
year it wanted to focus on its core businesses by expanding and 
strengthening its magazines tv stations and real estate holdings 
meredithburda has printing plants in des moines newton nc 
lynchburg va and casa grande ariz its photo preparation 
centers are in lynchburg and at hickory and greensboro nc

national contract bargaining shifts into high 
gear after the united auto workers union picked general motors 
corp as its primary target 
negotiators for the union and the worlds largest and most 
profitable automaker are working under a 17day deadline to arrive 
at a new threeyear contract about 300000 gm workers are covered 
by the contract 
while negotiations continue on their contract talks between the 
union and ford motor co and chrysler corp will creep ahead in 
all more than 450000 active workers are covered by the three uaw 
contracts all of which expire sept 14 
gm spokesman john maciarz said tuesday the company was happy 
with the uaws selection and that the bargaining pace would speed 
up now he said the union and the company are close to agreement on 
some noneconomic issues 
uaw president owen bieber said tuesday the uaw chose gm as its 
target because the automaker had more to offer the union than the 
other two companies 
spokesmen for ford and chrysler said they were disappointed that 
the uaw passed them over but subcommittee meetings would continue 
while talks proceed between the union and gm 
if everything goes according to the unions plan a contract 
reached with gm will be used as a pattern for agreements with ford 
and chrysler 
automakers seek to be the unions bargaining target so they can 
reach an agreement more tailored to their needs the selection of 
gm as the target had been anticipated 
one of the things analysts said may have contributed to pushing 
the uaw toward choosing gm was robert stempel taking over as 
chairman on aug 1 employees hailed the selection of stempel 
because he came up through gms engineering and marketing ranks and 
is perceived as understanding them better than former chairman 
roger smith an accountant 
stempel made several upperlevel management changes immediately 
after taking office that shortened the lines between top executives 
and gms car and truckmaking divisions 
when he took over stempel said gm was on the road back to 
regaining lost marketshare profitably 
for the first half of this year gm reported it earned 16 
billion down 47 percent from last year but better than the 14 
billion earned by ford down 57 percent and the 251 million 
earned by chrysler down 64 percent 
bieber said major factors in picking gm included that the 
company was the only one to present a full contract proposal 
delivered last thursday and reports from the unions vice 
presidents in charge of its gm ford and chrysler departments 
union and company officials have declined to discuss any 
companys proposal but gms reportedly included a 2 percent 
increase in the base wage in the first year and 2 percent lump sum 
payments in the next two years 
perhaps more important the proposal contains no changes in 
healthcare coverage a major union concern and the company said 
it was willing to discuss job security the unions primary aim in 
this set of negotiations 
this is the first year the uaw has had common expiration dates 
with all three automakers in 11 years in 1988 the union bargained 
only with chrysler 
in 1987 the uaw chose ford as a target company and reached an 
agreement without a strike the last uaw walkout over a national 
contract occurred in 1985 when the union staged a 12day strike 
against chrysler

apple computer inc plans to introduce a 
lowerpriced line of macintosh personal computers in october but 
some of the machines wont be widely available until early 1991 
john cook spokesman for apples products division said tuesday 
that the company plans large production of the new line and wants 
to ensure supply levels before market introduction 
in introducing the new macintoshs apple wont completely 
discontinue its existing cheap macintosh computers the macintosh 
plus and the macintosh se a move that could leave computer owners 
with obsolete machines 
one of the things we havent done since 1984 when we first 
introduced macintoshes was to obsolete anything cook said 
you can buy a 1984 macintosh and with a couple of upgrades run 
the present software customers demand this 
computer analysts say apple one of the most popular personal 
computer makers could lose market share if it doesnt get enough 
of the new lowercost machines in stores during the prime computer 
buying time november through january 
apple executives have been saying for months that one of their 
top priorities was introducing cheaper versions of the macintosh 
the companys mainstay product 
but analysts have said the cupertinobased company waited too 
long to make the move they say the company has been losing sales 
to cheaper personal computers based on international business 
machine corp models 
apples cook wouldnt comment on the details of the new 
macintosh line 
according to the san francisco chronicle the cheapest of the 
new machines will be called the macintosh classic and will have a 
builtin blackandwhite monitor similar to that on the macintosh 
plus and se 
the mac classic is expected to be priced between 1300 and 
1400 according to industry sources quoted in the article that 
compares with the 1799 list price for a mac plus the current 
lowestprice mac 
apple also will introduce a new lowcost colorscreen model that 
will be called the macintosh lc the color monitor will be made by 
sony corp 
the lc is expected to have a list price of 2800 compared with 
4669 for the current cheapest color mac 
the lc also will have room for a chip board that apple will 
introduce to allow the machine to run software designed for the 
apple ii computer which can be found in more than twothirds of 
school classrooms that are equipped with computers 
industry analysts have said apple needs to find a way to allow 
software written for the millions of apple iis to be used on the 
newer macintosh line otherwise apple ii users will be reluctant 
to upgrade to macintoshes

a federal appeals court says the resolution 
trust corp can override an arkansas banking law to sell insolvent 
thrifts and their branches to banks an rtc attorney said the 
ruling has nationwide implications 
on tuesday a threejudge panel from the 8th us circuit court 
of appeals ruled 21 to overturn a lower court ruling that the sale 
of independence federal savings bank of batesville to worthen bank 
and trust co of little rock would violate arkansass 
branchbanking law 
that law prohibits banks from having branches outside their home 
counties 
the rtc a government agency created to clean up insolvent 
thrifts argued that it was granted broad rulemaking authority by 
congress in its mission to maximize returns and minimize the losses 
rtc attorney dorothy nichols said the case had nationwide 
implications because 26 states have similar laws 
the rtcs authority to override state laws has been challenged 
in new mexico and colorado rtc spokesman steve katsanos said a 
district court judge in new mexico sided with the rtc earlier this 
year he said 
in colorado a hearing on the case is scheduled sept 5 
katsanos said the district court there has issued a restraining 
order to keep the rtc from going ahead with any transaction that 
would involve overriding colorado state law 
tuesdays appeals court ruling was welcomed by worthen president 
and chairman curt bradbury 
we consider todays ruling to be a significant victory for the 
taxpayers of the united states he said 
we are strongly committed to assisting in the resolution of 
the sampl crisis in arkansas and consider our opportunity to purchase 
independence to be a beneficial stabilizing force for the 
financialservices segment of our economy bradbury said 
the acquisition would bring assets of worthens parent company 
worthen banking corp to 21 million according to a news release 
from worthen that would make it the largest bank holding company 
in the state 
in arguments before the appellate court the rtcs nichols 
argued that most of independences branch offices would be shut 
down by the rtc if the institution were sold piecemeal 
the most valuable assets of sampls in dire straits arent their 
loan portfolios she said the most valuable asset of a failed 
thrift is its branches 
arkansas state bank commissioner bill j ford argued that the 
states 1988 branching law which would permit statewide branches 
gradually over 10 years was necessary to ensure fair competition 
ford and the arkansas independent bankers association had filed 
suit june 28 to block the proposed sale to worthen 
tuesdays opinion overruling a decision by us district judge 
stephen m reasoner of little rock was written by circuit judge 
john r gibson for circuit judge frank j magill 
senior circuit judge gerald w heaney dissented he agreed with 
arkansas officials that the rtcs regulation referred only to the 
ability of the savings associations to operate branches and not to 
the ability of a bank to retain and operate branches 
at issue is an rtc regulation that permits banks making 
emergency acquisitions of insolvent thrifts such as independence to 
operate the branches of the thrift as bank branches independence 
has 20 branches in 15 counties

the government said today its main forecasting 
gauge of future economic activity was flat in july indicating 
widespread weakness in the us economy even before the persian 
gulf crisis increased the chances of a recession 
the commerce department said the lack of any change in the index 
of leading economic indicators followed revised gains of 01 
percent in june and 06 percent in may 
but analysts said they expected a steep drop in august because 
of the oil price spike and consumer jitters spurred by fears of war 
in the middle east following the aug2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
typically three consecutive declines in the index are viewed as 
a fairly reliable although not infallible signal that the economy 
is headed for a recession 
following iraqs invasion many economists believe a recession 
is looming as an already sluggish us economy falls victim to 
rising inflation and consumer worries about a possible war 
in another economic report today the commerce department said 
sales of new homes fell 23 percent in july giving up half of 
their gain the previous month the government said new home sales 
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 548000 after 
advancing a revised 47 percent in june 
while the leading index normally forecasts economic activity six 
to nine months in advance some analysts believe the next recession 
may start sooner with the most pessimistic believing the country 
may already be in a downturn 
already the stock market one of the components which makes up 
the index has staged a sharp retreat and consumer confidence is on 
the skids 
initial reports from the university of michigan which 
measures consumer sentiment for commerce indicate that the 
consumers first reaction to the iraqi invasion was near panic 
according to economist mark m zandi of regional financial 
associates in west chester pa 
the sentiment index fell 15 points more than after the 1987 
stock market crash to a level consistent with previous 
recessions he said although sentiment has likely improved 
in recent days the risks of a consumer retrenchment are 
rising 
since consumer spending represents twothirds of the nations 
economic activity many analysts fear the persian gulf crisis could 
cause further retrenchment leading to a recession 
however after falling in may and june the consumer index rose 
slightly in july other positive contributors to the index were an 
increase in orders for new plants and equipment and an increase in 
the price of raw materials 
negative contributors were faster business delivery times a 
decline in the money supply a drop in manufacturers unfilled 
orders a shorter average workweek a drop in building permits an 
increase in weekly unemployment claims and a decline in the stock 
market 
one of the components orders for consumer goods was unchanged 
the various changes left the index at 1461 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 and up 14 percent from its level a year ago 
if a recession can be avoided through november the economic 
expansion already the nations longest in peacetime will have 
reached its eighth anniversary 
but it has been growing sluggishly for two years and some 
analysts contend that if the economy is not in a recession now it 
soon will be 
the us economy was stagnating well before the persian gulf 
crisis merrill lynch economists wrote in their weekly economic amp 
financial commentary they noted the economy grew at a meager 12 
percent annual rate in the second quarter and said thirdquarter 
indicators so far have been uniformly weak 
for july they said employment declined industrial 
production was flat retail sales did not keep pace with inflation 
and housing starts dropped to the lowest level since 1982 and 
that covered the period before the persian gulf crisis 
consumer spending represents twothirds of the nations economic 
activity and economists worry that a major cutback could halt 
economic growth altogether and even push the nation into recession 
even before the invasion many analysts were citing consumer 
concerns over rising interest rates a lack of job growth high 
levels of debt the savings and loan crisis and other adverse 
economic news 
consumer spending is only up about 1 percent year over year 
said merrill lynchs bruce steinberg that is typical of a 
recession 
since then numerous polls have shown consumers growing even 
more cautious just monday the new yorkbased conference board 
reported its survey of 5000 households nationwide showed 
confidence plummeted nearly 18 points to a sevenyear low of 838 
in august the index had remained virtually unchanged at 1017 in 
july 
a war situation causes consumer confidence to fall explained 
richard peach an economist with the mortgage bankers association 
people become unwilling to take on major responsibilities like 
buying a new house 
in addition the surge in oil prices forces individuals to spend 
more for gasoline and heating costs and leaves them with less 
discretionary income for such items as cars and refrigerators 
and with major sectors such as automobiles and housing already 
weak analysts say it would not take much of a shove to force the 
economy into a decline

opecs oil ministers today approved a 
plan allowing saudi arabia venezuela and other member countries to 
pump more oil and help hold down crude prices during the persian 
gulf crisis 
iran refused to back the deal and iraq and libya did not show 
up for the meeting of the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita predicted the 
agreement could free up to an additional 3 million barrels of oil a 
day 
an international embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti crude has wiped 4 
million barrels a day off world markets and caused oil prices to 
skyrocket the un sanctions were imposed after iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
the extra oil from opec should be primarily directed toward 
the countries of the third world which are those that will be most 
immediately and adversely affected by any supply disruption the 
cartel said in a statement 
oil prices which soared last week above 30 a barrel have 
dropped slightly in anticipation of greater opec production 
in late morning trading today on the new york mercantile 
exchange october contracts for light sweet crude dropped 183 to 
2605 per barrel futures contracts for other months were also 
down 
sheik ali khalifa alsabah the finance minister for the kuwaiti 
governmentinexile said the added flow of oil should help 
stabilize prices 
we simply cannot accept that the countries that came to our 
help in the gulf should suffer he said 
we cannot accept that prices go up because of iraqi aggression 
and occupation of our country said the official who was his 
governments oil minister until july 
in opposing the deal iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh 
said western industrialized nations must draw down some of their 
oil stocks before seeking help from the cartel 
after that we can do something he said 
he said iran one of opecs leading producers will not increase 
output above its quota of 31 million barrels a day analysts say 
its unclear how much more iran could produce because of the heavy 
damage inflicted on its oil industry during an eightyear war with 
iraq 
but saudi arabia venezuela the united arab emirates and a few 
others were expected to take steps immediately to help fill the oil 
gap 
saudi arabian oil minister hisham nazer left shortly after the 
meeting and did not announce his countrys plans 
but earlier he said the nation will boost output by 2 million 
barrels a day some sources say the saudis have already lifted 
production beyond its opec supply quota of 54 million barrels a 
day 
venezuelas oil minister celestino armas said his country 
could initially add an extra 300000 barrels a day to its ceiling 
of 19 million barrels 
we are taking the position to supply another 200000 barrels 
a day by the end of the year he said 
the united arab emirates was expected to raise production by as 
much as 500000 barrels a day above its quota of 15 million 
barrels 
in july all 13 nations agreed on a limit of 225 million 
barrels a day in an effort to boost prices to 21 a barrel 
in a statement the cartel said it decided to increase 
production in accordance with need in order to maintain market 
stability and a regular flow of crude to consumers 
it also urged major oilconsuming nations to draw down some of 
their oil inventories 
ten of the 11 nations worked out the agreement early tuesday but 
delayed endorsing it to give iraq and libya time to act 
sources requesting anonymity said iraq claimed the meeting was 
held on too short notice and questioned its legality 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

toyota motor corp japans largest automobile 
manufacturer plans to triple the sales of its nonautomotive 
divisions by 1994 the company said wednesday 
executive vice president masami iwasaki made the disclosure at a 
news conference where he also reported toyotas consolidated profit 
had risen 274 percent in its latest fiscal year 
iwasaki said toyota will raise the output of its nonautomotive 
divisions from roughly 2 percent of its sales to 6 percent 
though small in percentage terms 6 percent of toyotas total 
domestic sales would be 4799 billion yen or 31 billion based 
on the companys latest annual sales figures 
in addition to cars toyota also produces industrial vehicles 
such as forklifts and shovel loaders builds homes and manufactures 
factory automation equipment 
toyota and other japanese automobile manufacturers have 
traditionally devoted a much smaller part of their operations to 
nonautomobile sectors than their european or american 
counterparts the move is thought to represent toyotas decision to 
begin diversifying away from automobiles as world demand for cars 
shrinks and competition intensifies 
it also comes at the same time that american auto makers have 
been selling off their nonautomobile subsidiaries 
iwasaki said toyota would revise its charter to permit the 
company to enter new fields such as aerospace medical equipment 
and ceramics but he said it expected greatest growth in housing 
industrial vehicles and factory automation 
the company also announced wednesday that its consolidated net 
profit rose 274 percent to 4413 billion yen or about 285 
billion in the fiscal year ended june 30 from 3463 billion yen a 
year earlier 
its pretax earnings were up 339 percent to 8378 billion yen 
or 55 billion from 6257 billion yen the previous year the 
consolidated statement includes 39 subsidiaries and related 
companies 
consolidated sales totaled 919 trillion yen or 600 billion 
up 146 percent from 802 trillion yen in sales last year 
the manufacturer said robust domestic sales coupled with 
moderate expansion in southeast asia and steady growth in north 
america underlined its strong showing 
unconsolidated exports fell 110 percent to 1608484 vehicles 
for the year while overseas production rose by 835 percent 
toyota said intensifying competition within japan an expected 
slowdown in growth of automobile demand in the united states plus 
any impact from the middle east crisis might make it more difficult 
to achieve similar results in the future 
nevertheless the car maker said it plans to increase vehicle 
sales within japan by 40 percent and exports by 76 percent during 
the next fiscal year

italian finance officials proposed wednesday 
to freeze prices of petroleum products for three months to fight 
inflationary fallout from the gulf crisis 
treasury minister guido carli finance minister rino fomica and 
budget minister paolo cirino pomicino will ask the cabinet friday 
to approve a price freeze that would go into effect from september 
through november 
the freeze is aimed at buffering the italian economy which is 
highly oil dependent from the impact of the higher oil prices 
caused by the iraqi invasion and annexation of kuwait on aug 2 
according to preliminary industry estimates the jump in oil 
prices could add a half percentage point to the inflation rate 
depending on the level of the dollar

the swedish car maker volvo said 
wednesday it is cutting 5000 jobs this year and next because 
profits during the first six months of 1990 have declined by half 
a reduction in demand for cars and trucks in north america was a 
major cause of the profit decline according to volvos interim 
report released wednesday 
an 11 percent decline in domestic demand and a 17 percent drop 
in the british market also contributed to the lower profits the 
report said 
profits dropped from 42 billion kronor or 744 million in the 
first six months of 1989 to just over 2 billion kronor or 359 
million this year the interim report said 
the company has already dropped 1000 employees in the car and 
truck sector this year and plans to reduce the work force by 
another 4000 through 1991 
the major cuts in the number of employees will be made in 
sweden the companys executive christer zetterberg said in a radio 
interview 
it is due to the development of the cost of production in 
sweden that has not been favorable for several years now and it has 
been difficult to increase the production in a way that compensates 
for the increase of salaries zetterberg said

the kuwaitibased united 
arab shipping co jointly owned by six gulf arab countries 
including kuwait and iraq has shifted its base to dubai shipping 
executives said wednesday 
the companys board of directors has completed a plan to 
continue operations from the southern gulf port city said the 
shipping executives who spoke on condition that they not be named 
the uasc is a gulf shareholding company established in 1976 by 
the governments of the united arab emirates kuwait iraq saudi 
arabia bahrain and qatar 
all 48 of its vessels including 15 container ships were out of 
kuwait waters when iraq invaded the country on aug 2 the 
executives said 
the company was trying to sort out its critical position 
following the invasion and resulting embargo against oil from iraq 
and kuwait said the executives issues facing the company after 
the invasion included the status of iraqi shares and the shifting 
of company headquarters from kuwait which means reflagging the 
vessels 
the sources said that with dubai as the companys base ships 
could be registered under the uae flag to avert the dangers of 
embargo enforcement they would encounter under the kuwaiti flag 
the company would not violate the united nations embargo on 
goods to iraq or occupied kuwait

grain and soybean futures prices closed lower 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade with aggressive commodity 
fund selling late in the session 
the sharp selloff was attributed to the continuing good growing 
conditions in the midwest and the perception that crop yields will 
be larger than predicted by the us department of agriculture 
said william biedermann an analyst with allendale inc in chicago 
there is also the perception that the soviet union will not 
enter the us market for grains and soybeans until october 
biedermann said 
also contributing to the fall in prices was the diminishing of 
inflationary pressures as indicated by a drop in energy futures 
prices 
biedermann said the light volume of trading on the board of 
trade allowed the selloff to begin and accelerate toward the close 
of business 
at the close wheat prices were 3 cents lower to 2 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in september at 279 a bushel 
corn was a cent to 2 cents lower with september at 253 a 
bushel oats were 2 cents to 2 cents lower with september at 
105 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 10 cents lower with 
september at 610 a bushel

lockheed corp on wednesday unveiled its 
version of a futuristic fighter proposed for the 21st century as 
air force officials cited the middle east crisis as the need for 
such a craft 
the lockheed yf22 prototype of the advanced tactical fighter 
followed mondays launch of a prototype made by northrop corp the 
two designs are competing for a multibilliondollar contract 
the plane lockheed unveiled at its palmdale manufacturing plant 
was much more compact than the northrop version 
both planes have smooth contours to help them evade radar and 
are built of advanced composite materials the lockheed aircraft 
has stubby wings while the northrop plane is longer with a 
cigarlike fuselage and a wingspan that looks like a kite 
a music system blared wagners flight of the valkyries as 
the lockheed plane was rolled out although unlike its competition 
the yf22 stayed on the ground after its rollout officials would 
not say when it would be flown 
lockheed chairman daniel m tellep said it will not matter that 
northrop got its aircraft up first 
it is not he who flies first it is he who flies best he 
said 
the contract calls for 750 fighter planes for the air force and 
approximately 500 for the navy at a cost of 51 million apiece the 
price tag is about twice the cost of the f15 eagle the current 
frontline fighter deployed in the middle east 
the atf program faced fading prospects for approval in congress 
before iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 but the crisis has 
enhanced prospects for approval of major defense projects 
air force maj gen joseph w ralston said he is optimistic 
about congessional funding for the atf program desspite recent 
defense spending cuts 
in building the yf22 prototype lockheed teamed with the boeing 
corp and general dynamics corp northrop teamed with mcdonnell 
douglas corp for its test version of the futuristic fighter 
the winner must give the pentagon a fighter plane that can fly 
twice the speed of sound is highly maneuverable and uses 
radarevading stealth technology 
if northrop gets the contract atf planes will be built in 
southern california lockheed has said if it wins the competition 
the fighters will be made in marietta ga

new homes sales in july fell for the fifth 
time in seven months the government said wednesday and industry 
observers said rising mortgage rates linked to the mideast crisis 
will compound the decline in months ahead 
we will be facing a few months of significant weakness because 
of the runup in rates said robert villanueva forecasting 
director for the national association of home builders 
at least for the remainder of the year its difficult to be 
optimistic said james nelson presidentelect of the mortgage 
bankers association and chief executive officer of eberhardt co a 
minneapolis mortgage banking company 
the commerce department said new home sales totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 548000 units down from 561000 units in 
june and 741000 in july 1989 
at the same time the department offered evidence of even more 
sluggishness earlier revising downward the sales totals in both 
may and june 
it said sales edged up just 06 percent in may rather than the 
23 percent reported last month and 47 percent in june instead of 
the 8 percent in the earlier report 
for the first seven months of the year sales have fallen 124 
percent below the pace of 1989 
the department also said inventories of new homes showed a 78 
month backlog at the july sales pace it had been 77 months in 
june 
analysts had expected a pickup in sales in july as fixedrate 
30year mortgage rates continued to slide from their 1990 peak of 
1067 percent in may to 998 percent by the end of the month 
but mark obrinsky an economist with the federal national 
mortgage association said consumer confidence was waning even 
before the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait because of uncertainty 
over the economy 
when that happens they tend to postpone purchases of 
highpriced things he said 
nevertheless sales of existing homes did rise in july up 33 
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 344 million units 
according to the national association of realtors 
john a tuccillo the associations chief economist said sales 
of existing homes advanced because of their lower prices 
the median price of a new home was 121000 in july commerce 
said that was down 47 percent from june but still 22600 more 
than the 98400 median price for an existing home in the realtors 
survey the median price means half of the homes cost more half 
less 
but analysts also expect resales to drop as mortgage rates 
increase by last friday the average rate was 1029 percent 
according to the federal home loan mortgage corp 
new home sales in the northeast which have been sluggish for 
more than a year fell 101 percent to an annual rate of 80000 
units the department also revised the june increase downward from 
369 percent to 253 percent 
sales fell in the west down 49 percent to 135000 units while 
they were unchanged at 237000 units in the south 
sales rose 21 percent to 96000 units in the midwest

pollution stress and strenuous exercise new yorks attorney 
general announced wednesday 
attorney general robert abrams said there was no conclusive and 
scientific proof that any vitamins could protect people from such 
ill effects 
oneadays claims are patently false and only create an 
unfounded belief in the benefits of the product abrams said in a

television and radio ads for the vitamins say defending your 
lungs against air pollution requires vitamins a c and e daily 
stress can chip away at your b vitamins and rigorous physical

the federal deposit insurance corp said 
wednesday it has issued a ruling effectively barring 
statechartered savings and loan associations from withdrawing from 
the federal home loan bank system for at least 18 months 
the action eases concerns that the fdic might be on the verge of 
allowing a giant exodus of sampls from the system which would 
cripple the systems ability to finance the savings and loan 
bailout 
the action came on a request by the wauwatosa savings and loan 
association of wauwatosa wis which had asked if it could 
maintain its federal deposit insurance if it pulled out of the 
federal home loan bank of chicago 
in a statement the fdic said it could make no assurances at 
this time to wauwatosa that it would be able to retain its deposit 
insurance should it withdraw from membership in the federal home 
loan bank system 
because both banks and sampls depend on federal deposit insurance 
to operate the fdic decision effectively blocks any exodus by 
statechartered institutions out of the sampl system 
the fdic said its action which was taken at a closed board 
meeting on tuesday was based on recommendations made by the office 
of thrift supervision the agency which regulates the sampl industry 
the ots said that the withdrawal of sampls from the home loan bank 
system would pose safety and soundness concerns 
the fdic did agree to review the matter in 18 months it said 
that would give the ots time to draw up regulations clarifying the 
situation the ots is expected to propose a regulation that would 
require statechartered sampls to belong to the federal home loan 
bank system 
of the 2505 savings and loans still operating about half of 
them are federally chartered and the other half have state charters 
both state and federally chartered sampls were members of the 
federal savings and loan insurance corp the nowdefunct agency 
which provided insurance of up to 100000 per deposit at sampls 
the sampl bailout legislation passed by congress last year made it 
clear that federally chartered sampls must maintain their membership 
in the sampl system even though their insurance fund was being 
administered by the fdic however the legislation was less clear 
about the status of statechartered thrifts 
the home loan bank system is required to contribute up to 300 
million annually as its share of the sampl bailout a burden which 
some sampls have complained adds to their cost of operation and makes 
it difficult for them to compete with commercial banks 
however bush administration officials contended that if the 
fdic allowed statechartered sampls to leave it would make it 
difficult for the home loan bank system to come up with its 
required contribution to the bailout

five central american countries 
have asked mexico and venezuela for relief from the increase in oil 
prices prompted by the middle east crisis 
the military invasion of kuwait by iraq which deeply concerns 
our people will affect the world petroleum market and will bring 
inevitable political and economic consequences for central 
america president rafael leonardo callejas told the associated 
press 
meanwhile wednesday venezuela said it planned to increase oil 
production capacity and brazil said it would receive more oil from 
iran to make up for shortages due to the embargo on oil from iraq 
and occupied kuwait 
under the 10yearold san jose agreement five central american 
countries have been buying venezuelan and mexican oil for an 
average 17 a barrel paying 80 percent in cash mexico and 
venezuela allow the other 20 percent to be used as loans for 
development projects or to finance imports from venezuela and 
mexico 
under the proposal by honduras and four other nations the 
countries would pay 70 percent of their oil bills in cash as long 
as prices remain high callejas said the other 30 percent would be 
covered as credits for purchases of mexican or venezuelan goods and 
services or as loans for development projects 
the other four nations are el salvador costa rica nicaragua 
and guatemala the san jose agreement also covers belize panama 
jamaica the dominican republic and barbados 
meanwhile venezuela plans to increase its oil production 
capacity to 286 million barrels per day in 1990 a 60000barrel 
increase petroleos de venezuela said wednesday 
venezuela is actually pumping only about 2 million barrels daily 
and has said it intends to bring up to 500000 more by the end of 
the year to make up for the oil lost by the embargo 
and in brazil irans ambassador told reporters his country will 
increase oil sales to brazil by 200000 barrels a day to cover the 
loss of imports from iraq and kuwait 
mahmoud movahedi said iran would sign a deal with the brazilian 
government oil monopoly petrobras for the sale of an extra 100000 
barrels of oil a day

right now weve gone from wartime psychosis last friday 
when the price was 32 back to no war said david d hale chief 
economist with kemper financial services inc in chicago 
contracts for crudeoil delivery in later months also fell 
following word that the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries had approved a plan allowing saudi arabia venezuela and 
other producers to boost output 
the international boycott of crude from iraq and kuwait has kept 
about 4 million barrels per day off the world markets which last 
week jacked oil prices up to the highest level in five years 
sources in vienna where the opec officials met estimated the 
new opec oil might come to 3 million barrels per day making up 
most of the shortfall 
the only real thing that has happened is it looks like opec 
has kind of blessed the increasing of output by producers said 
stephen smith an analyst with bear stearns amp co its still 
looking like no hostilities for the time being and no extreme 
shortage of oil 
home heating oil fell 788 cents to 7164 cents per gallon on 
september contracts traded on the mercantile exchange unleaded 
gasoline dropped 381 cents to 8472 cents per gallon on september 
contracts 
both products were also down for other future months with 
heating oil futures for october through january dropping their 
maximum limit of 6 cents per gallon the limit which offers 
traders on the merc a degree of protection applies to all contract 
months except the nearest or spot month 
natural gas was up from 1500 to 1505 per 1000 cubic feet on 
october contracts other natural gas futures months were down 
a dean witter reynolds inc trader ed kevelson said investors 
were responding partly to reports that the iraqi leader saddam 
hussein might take a softer stance on his claims to kuwait during 
a meeting thursday with un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar 
we just heard the story that hussein is supposedly going to 
propose federated selfrule for kuwait kevelson said 
traders were not quite sure what type of rule that would be for 
the oilrich nation seized by iraq aug 2 kevelson said he doubted 
anything would come from such a proposal but nonetheless it helped 
depress petroleum prices 
people tend to focus now on the bearish news and the opec news 
instead of the tension kevelson said 
the possibility of peace thats it said sal gilbertie a 
trader with merrill lynch energy futures 
despite cheaper wholesale oil traded on the merc and elsewhere 
gasoline prices were rising at the pump figures from the american 
automobile association showed 
selfserve regular unleaded averaged 1307 a gallon nationwide 
an increase of 33 cents over friday the aaa reported wednesday 
retail gasoline prices have risen 232 cents per gallon since aug 
1 the day before iraq invaded kuwait aaa said

another round of selling pushed energy futures prices lower 
wednesday on the new york mercantile exchange as opec ministers 
agreed to suspend production restraints and allow members to boost 
the flow of oil 
on other markets precious metals were steady grain and soybean 
futures fell and livestock and pork futures closed mixed 
light sweet crude settled 33 cents to 196 lower with the 
contract for delivery in october at 2592 a barrel heating oil 
was 539 cents to 788 cents lower with september at 7164 cents a 
gallon unleaded gasoline was 250 cents to 582 cents lower with 
september at 8472 cents a gallon 
initial selling of energy futures was set off by reports that 
saudi arabia was already producing 75 million barrels a day said 
michael rothman an analyst with merrill lynch captial markets inc 
in new york 
he said indications are saudi arabia will boost output to 8 
million barrels by the end of september and 85 million barrels by 
the end of the year 
further selling pressure came on reports that iraqi said it 
would pull out of kuwait if the united nations sanctions were 
dropped and the country was guaranteed access to the persian gulf 
and sole control of a kuwaiti oil field 
the united states has refused to confirm or deny the report 
which rothman said set off another round of peace selling 
in vienna ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries agreed to boost oil production by 3 million to 35 
million barrels a day to offset the loss of 4 million barrels due 
to the embargo of iraq 
precious metal futures halted their plunge on new yorks 
commodity exchange largely disregarding plunging energy futures 
prices 
trading volume fell from tuesdays level due to increased 
margins on gold and silver contracts demanded by the exchange the 
move makes trading more expensive and dampened market enthusiasm 
said don tierney an analyst with stanley bell amp co in new york 
tierney said selling hit the market early in the session as 
energy prices fell but moderate buying by speculators and 
investors in london helped stablize prices 
after losing over 30 in recent trading sessions gold is coming 
out of its oversold condition with some new buying beginning to 
support the market tierney said 
gold was 10 cents lower to 30 cents higher with august at 
38530 a troy ounce silver was 16 cents to 18 cents lower with 
august at 4826 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures prices were lower on the chicago board 
of trade with aggressive commodity fund selling coming late in the 
session 
the sharp selloff was attributed to the continuing good growing 
conditions in the midwest and the perception that crop yields will 
be larger than predicted by the us department of agriculture 
said william biedermann an analyst with allendale inc in chicago 
there is also the perception that the soviet union will not 
enter the us market for grains and soybeans until october 
biedermann said 
also contributing to the fall in prices was the diminishing of 
inflationary pressures as indicated by a drop in energy futures 
prices 
biedermann said the light volume of trading on the board of 
trade allowed the selloff to begin and accelerate toward the close 
of business 
wheat was 4 cents to 6 cents lower with september at 275 a 
bushel corn was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with september at 250 
a bushel oats were 3 cents to 3 cents lower with september at 
104 a bushel soybeans were 7 cents to 16 cents lower with 
september at 605 a bushel 
livestock futures were lower and pork futures mostly higher on 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
cattle prices were pressured by light retail demand for beef and 
expectations of a decline in cash prices 
pork futures were higher on ideas that demand for pork products 
will increase 
live cattle were 13 cent to 58 cent lower with october at 
7607 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent lower to 20 cent 
higher with august at 8877 cents a pound hogs were 02 cent to 
37 cent higher with october at 4882 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 22 cent to 35 cent higher with february at 5260 
cents a pound

the repaired and renamed ship that caused the 
countrys worst oil spill left san diego bay for sea trials 
wednesday after a multimilliondollar repair job to its mangled 
hull 
the rebuilt exxon mediterranean formerly named the exxon 
valdez got underway at 645 am as tugboats pulled the ship from 
a pier and guided it through the harbor 
there were no protesters trailing the ship as there were when 
the 32000ton tanker with its severely damaged hull was towed 
into harbor from alaska 13 months ago 
workers at national steel amp shipbuilding co replaced 3000 tons 
of steel in the mangled hull during the 11month 30 million 
repair job the 987footlong tanker was floated out of dry dock 
last month and underwent dock trials at a nassco pier 
the ship which was built at nassco and delivered to exxon in 
1986 will head for international waters about 100 miles from the 
san diego coast and some 25 miles past san clemente island said 
nassco spokesman fred hallett 
officials from nassco the coast guard and the american bureau 
of shipping will be aboard the ship during the sea trials which 
are expected to last between a week and 10 days exxon spokeswoman 
carrie chassin said wednesday 
all the structural work has been approved but this sea trial 
is to make sure everything is in perfect operating condition 
chassin said they will be testing all the systems of the ship 
the steering a comprehensive review until everyone is satisfied 
during sea trials the crew will run the tanker at full speed 
make maximum turns and test machinery and equipment hallett said 
typically when we repair a ship we dont put it through a 
shakedown hallett said but because of the extensive repairs 
and the problems it had exxon will put it through a shakedown as 
if it were a new ship 
exxon officials deny that the tankers renaming in july was 
related to the spill of nearly 11 million gallons of oil when the 
ship ran aground on alaskas prince william sound on march 24 1989 
officials say the tanker will transport crude in the 
mediterranean the vessel holds nearly 14 million barrels of 
crude and is too big for any us pacific ports when fully loaded 
exxon officials have said they also say tankers that big arent 
needed for west coast shipping routes because of declining 
production from alaskan oil fields 
coast guard lt bill uberti certified the ships seaworthiness 
after testing its machinery and engines he will be aboard during 
the sea trials 
after the trials are finished chassin said the ship and its 
20member crew will return to san diego for supplies before sailing 
to singapore 
in singapore it will take on additional fuel and provisions 
and then go to egypt and the middle east load crude and then 
unload in france the united kingdom and rotterdam chassin said 
it will not load iraqi crude in turkey

opec ministers wednesday endorsed higher 
crude production to make up most but not all of the shortfall 
caused by the persian gulf crisis 
the accord worked out during four days of discussions 
temporarily suspends the cartels quota system to permit higher 
output by nations with spare capacity 
an agreement worked out last month by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries had set production at 225 million 
barrels per day but an embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti oil imposed 
after iraqs invasion of kuwait four weeks ago has reduced supply 
by about 4 million barrels 
the shortfall has led to increased prices for crude oil on world 
markets as well as hefty hikes for gasoline and heating oil sold on 
the retail level 
analysts predicted the surge in output of about 3 million 
barrels of crude by heavyweight saudi arabia and other producing 
nations could help hold down prices in the next few weeks 
but they cautioned prices could shoot even higher with a further 
escalation of hostilities in the gulf and stronger demand for oil 
as winter approaches 
the market may pull back some but the trend continues to 
remain on the up side as long as the military option in the gulf 
remains a viable one said michael rothman an energy specialist 
at merrill lynch capital markets in new york 
peter bogin associate director for oil markets at cambridge 
energy research associates in paris said gasoline prices at the 
pump should hold steady as long as crude prices do 
since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 the average price of a 
gallon of unleaded regular gasoline in the united states has 
increased by more than 23 cents at the pumps according to a survey 
released wednesday by the american automobile association 
the price of light sweet crude for october delivery was 2592 
on the new york mercantile exchange wednesday down 196 a barrel 
from the day before 
sheikh ali khalifa alsabah the finance minister of kuwaits 
governmentinexile pressed for the agreement by the 13nation 
opec 
we simply cannot accept that countries that came to our help 
in the gulf should suffer from high prices said the official 
who was his governments oil minister until early july 
iran opposed the deal arguing that western nations should 
release oil from their inventories before asking opec for more 
if they do something after that we can do something said the 
nations oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh 
iraq and libya never showed up for the meeting which iraq said 
was held illegally 
indonesias oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita predicted that 
opec nations would pump an additional 3 million or more barrels of 
oil a day into the market 
but he said opec production will not be able to meet the 
loss 
in a final statement the ministers said they decided to 
increase production in accordance with need in order to 
maintain stable markets 
the extra oil from opec and consuming countries they said 
should go primarily to developing countries that would be hurt most 
by a disruption in supplies 
they called on consuming nations to actively participate in 
calming the markets and urged them to draw down some of their 
stocks 
saudi arabias influential minister hisham nazer left 
immediately after the meeting but he has said his countrys output 
will increase by 2 million barrels a day 
one opec source demanding anonymity said the kingdoms 
production has already risen to more than 7 million barrels a day 
well over its cartel quota of 54 million barrels 
iran a leading producing nation has no plans to boost 
production aqazadeh said 
venezuelas oil minister celestino armas said his country 
initially could add 300000 barrels a day to its ceiling of 19 
million barrels 
we are taking the position to supply another 200000 barrels 
by the end of the year he said 
the united arab emirates was expected to raise production by as 
much as a half million barrels a day above its quota of 15 million 
barrels 
jibril aminu the nigerian oil minister said his country if it 
wanted could produce 250000 to 280000 barrels a day beyond its 
limit of 16 million barrels 
libya could increase production about 100000 barrels a day over 
its cap of 12 million barrels analysts say 
it takes about four to six weeks for oil to work its way onto 
the market 
the opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

despite the embargo against iraq and 
iraqioccupied kuwait crude oil from those persian gulf nations is 
still reaching the united states and will be for probably another 
few weeks 
jonathan cogan of the energy information administration an 
independent statistical branch of the energy department said 
wednesday that ships loaded with oil prior to the us trade 
restrictions have until oct 1 to arrive in the united states 
when president bush enacted the embargo on aug 2 the day iraq 
invaded kuwait the government exempted from the restrictions 
delivery of crude that was already en route 
it was kind of unfair for those refiners who ordered this 
crude and perhaps already paid for it to not receive it cogan 
said 
authorities believe they have provided enough time for the 
grandfathered tankers to complete the journey which can take a 
month or more 
but any tanker that misses the deadline will be barred from 
unloading its oil treasury department spokeswoman barbara clay 
said 
an energy department spokesman philip keif estimated that 40 
million to 45 million barrels of iraqi crude were already in the 
pipeline at the time of the embargo 
a lot of iraqi and kuwaiti crude was loaded right up to the 
invasion said annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with 
shearson lehman brothers inc the second week of september 
thats when were going to feel the crunch

general development corp the developer accused of 
swindling thousands of people out of homesites wednesday unveiled 
a comprehensive plan designed to keep customers and help rebuild 
the company 
the developer which pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy in a 
march and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in april 
presented its plan to us bankruptcy judge a jay cristol 
the plan would create a land trust to give deeds to customers 
who pay off their contracts financial incentives for homesite 
buyers to continue making payments and a lot transfer program in 
which homesite owners of undeveloped lots could swap their sites 
for developed lots 
i for one am favorably impressed the judge said after the 
presentation by gordon pfersich senior vice president of land 
operations for general development 
what the customer really wants to know is if i keep paying 
am i going to get anything pfersich said we say yes 
robert roth an attorney representing the city of palm bay was 
not as sure i think its very pretty and very well 
presented he said but it doesnt give me enough substance 
general development has offered the state of florida and cities 
and counties involved undeveloped lots in most cases in return for 
settling development obligations the company also is turning over 
the utilities it operated to the cities and counties 
the plan would offer 35300 purchasers with contracts on 
undeveloped lots the option of transferring their lots to developed 
ones at no additional cost 
our problem is we dont know which lots theyre talking about 
and in which cities so we cant evaluate the plan roth said 
we have our doubts about whether these lots are as developed as 
they are saying 
general development has about 13000 unsold developed lots to 
which customers could be transferred many in retirement 
communities company officials said 
the 54600 purchasers with contracts for developed lots would be 
offered financial incentives to keep paying on their contracts 
such as a 5 percent cut on the original selling price which would 
lower monthly payments 
general development believes its current portfolio taking into 
account historical cancellation of contracts is worth about 648 
million subtracting accounts sold to investors its portfolio is 
about 434 million 
but taking into account the number of homesite buyers who were 
continuing to make payments as of july the company estimates its 
share of the entire portfolio is worth about 126 million 
company officials believe that by assuring customers they will 
get a deed to a developed homesite along with providing financial 
incentives the company could more than double the value of its 
share of the accounts to about 279 million 
last month the percentage of more than 77000 people still 
owing on properties but who have stopped making payments jumped to 
51 percent

the chicago board of trade should develop an 
electronic trading system create new products and attract new 
members and capital as it heads into the 21st century an report 
released wednesday said 
as the world continues to change and competition in our 
markets increases the chicago board of trade will face many new 
challenges and opportunities board of trade chairman william f 
oconnor said 
as an institution we must be prepared to act boldly to meet 
the changes headon he said 
the report was prepared by a task force headed by robert s 
hamada deputy dean of the university of chicago business school 
it said the board of trade must pursue a diverse set of new 
futures contracts to buy or sell everything from orange juice to 
wheat to securities at a specific date because of advantages in 
launching a product and intense competition 
the study said that despite the introduction of a number of new 
trading products in recent years 51 percent of the exchanges 
volume comes from treasury bond futures 
the study also concluded that paperless trading is essential to 
the future of pit trading and recommended pursuing new technology 
to that end 
the board of trade should use electronic systems that most 
closely duplicate the open outcry auction trading the study 
concluded the task force contended that the auction system adds to 
the liquidity of the market 
although the board of trade is negotiating with the rival 
chicago mercantile exchange to join in the globex trading system 
developed by the merc the task force said that should not 
interfere with experimentation with the aurora trading system being 
developed by the cbot 
the task force also recommended better incentive systems to 
attract members and capital to new products the study concluded 
that a mix of capital pools permits fee rebates and electronic 
trading systems should be developed and used to accomplish the goal 
the study also concluded that the current trading floor for 
financial futures is overcrowded and that the exchange should 
remedy the problem 
the report comes as the exchange battles some presentday 
problems the board of trade and the mercantile exchange received a 
black eye when an investigation into illegal trading activity 
resulted in the indictment of 48 people 
the exchange is also faced with a desire by regulators in 
washington to increase federal oversight of the commodities 
industry industry leaders say that could reduce the 
competitiveness of us futures market as foreign competition 
increases 
the task force recommended the exchange delegate authority to 
allow it to make quicker decisions the study said such a move 
would allow exchange leaders to focus on broad policy issues not 
operational details
