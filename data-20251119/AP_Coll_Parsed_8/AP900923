civil rights activist jesse jackson said sunday 
that he hoped to mediate a solution to the standoff between police 
and mohawk indians in oka 
hopefully through dialogue and through the interviewing 
process the tensions will ease and the bloodshed will stop he 
told reporters after arriving in montreal and there will be some 
rational resolution to this conflict 
jackson said hes already spoken to quebec premier robert 
bourassa about his efforts to resolve the crisis 
the problem that develops in standoffs is that people harden 
their positions he said and when talking becomes impossible 
violence becomes inevitable 
army spokesman maj john paul macdonald said jackson will be 
denied access to the kahnesatake treatment center where about 50 
mohawk women children and men have been encircled by soldiers for 
the last three weeks 
as with everyone else who has requested to come into the 
perimeter but really has no business being there he will be 
refused as well macdonald said 
the 74day standoff began over plans to sell property in the 
town of oka that the mohawks claim is ancestral land quebec 
provincial police stormed an indian roadblock in oka on july 11 and 
cpl marcel lemay was killed in the ensuing gun battle 
it has not been determined who was responsible for his death

senate majority leader george mitchell said 
sunday that democrats are willing to consider a republican idea for 
unsnarling stalled budget talks by placing a capital gains tax cut 
into a separate package 
mitchells comment was the first indication that democrats might 
be willing to explore the suggestion which senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan made thursday the fight over whether to slash 
the capital gains tax rate is perhaps the major hurdle remaining 
for the two sides to complete a fiveyear 500 billion 
deficitreduction package 
wed be prepared to consider it to work to see precisely 
what he has in mind and to come up with some way to get this thing 
done said mitchell dmaine on cbss face the nation 
his remarks came before eight budget bargainers from the bush 
administration and congress held a fourhour closeddoor evening 
session in the capitol there was no indication what if any 
progress was made by the group which has met four other times 
since last tuesday in an effort to end a yearlong budget stalemate 
another meeting was scheduled for monday 
meanwhile president bush was reported to have expressed 
optimism about a budget agreement during a conversation with 
maryland gov william donald schaefer 
schaefer who talked with the president at a maryland golf 
course where he stopped for an 18hole round en route back to the 
white house from camp david had told reporters beforehand how 
worried he was about the prospects of massive furloughs starting 
oct 1 if the white house and congress fail to reach a budget 
agreement 
thousands of federal workers live in the maryland suburbs of 
washington and baltimore where social securitys headquarters is 
located 
after speaking with bush schaefer said he told the president 
im very worried he said the president replied i think well 
have a deal 
he was not pessimistic he was very optimistic the governor 
told reporters 
dole has suggested that the negotiators write two measures one 
would contain tax increases and spending cuts 
the second bill would contain what he on the same program called 
all the goodies these would include the capital gains tax 
reduction which bush wants a more expensive child care program 
favored by democrats and tax breaks for the poor and for 
businesses 
the measure which could cost 50 billion or 60 billion 
would have to be paid for by additional taxes or spending 
reductions 
we ought to stop dancing around capital gains face up to it 
get it resolved and get this package put to bed dole said 
dole broke somewhat with his gop colleagues by emphasizing the 
importance the capital gains dispute holds in clearing the way for 
a deal other republicans have argued that differences over 
spending cuts and the types of taxes to be raised are just as 
important in finishing the negotiations 
right now the big hurdle is capital gains dole said 
dole seemed to express pique at the pace of negotiations favored 
by white house budget bargainers 
we shouldnt be in too much of a rush he said white house 
officials have told him well i dont know what else theyve got 
to do this year but ive got a lot of things id like to do 
the delay he said could be strategically costly 
were losing votes every day in my view in the house and the 
senate by not getting it done he said 
it is unclear whether doles suggestion to create two packages 
will ever become a formal gop offer at the budget talks some white 
house officials including chief of staff john sununu have 
vehemently opposed the idea at a news conference friday bush 
failed to endorse it but did not rule it out either 
the full impact of the idea is also uncertain because of an 
unusual voting procedure dole has suggested 
under his plan the two measures would be voted on separately 
but if the goodies package were to be defeated then the 
deficitreduction measure would be considered rejected as well 
even if it was approved on an earlier vote 
the proposal raises yet another question how would the capital 
gains tax reduction and other goodies be paid for budget 
bargainers have had a hard enough time coming up with 500 billion 
worth of savings let alone having to find another 50 billion or 
60 billion

as food grew scarce and iraqi soldiers more entrenched ruthie 
and her husband made the decision she and their three young 
children could not remain in kuwait 
i dont like to talk this way in front of the kids but here 
are my thoughts it feels like i left him there to die said 
ruthie alqallef a memphis tenn native l feel like i 
deserted him 
she and hundreds of other american wives and children who fled 
the middle east remain trapped by visions of loved ones left 
behind 
leaving him was the hardest thing ive ever done said mrs 
alqallef whose husband of 10 years is a kuwaiti military officer 
his face scared me more than the whole six weeks we spent in 
hiding 
her husbands eyes were glazed his expression frozen his 
silence didnt add to the tension she said it was the tension 
he didnt know how to say goodbye 
separated families were the result of saddam husseins order 
that foreign men not be allowed to leave after his invasion of 
kuwait in early august many are being used as shields against 
attack 
an estimated 930 americans remain in kuwait and 170 in iraq the 
state department says at the time of the invasion about 3500 
us citizens were in either iraq or kuwait 
rande vallekoop said goodbye to her husband laurens soon after 
sunrise on aug 25 bolstered by a night of shared whispers and 
prayers the american woman avoided tears when she and the couples 
two young daughters left her husband behind at the us embassy in 
baghdad 
i cried when i got to turkey said mrs vallekoop who 
returned home to relatives in minneapolis the people that met us 
at the border just kind of took us into their arms it was so 
difficult knowing he was still in there 
mrs vallekoop and her husband an employee at the us embassy 
in kuwait were separated by iraqi authorities after fleeing 
kuwait 
we were notified that only the women and children would be 
allowed to leave mrs vallekoop 30 said recently it was 
totally heartwrenching 
she has been able to speak periodically with her husband who 
remains stranded but able to communicate with her from the us 
embassy in baghdad 
bonnie anderton hasnt had any word since parting with her 
husband richard an engineer the image of him cooped up at the 
besieged embassy in kuwait is all she has to go on 
and the picture isnt pretty by the time mrs anderton and her 
10yearold daughter left in august embassy staff members had 
already begun draining the swimming pool for drinking water 
the food was spoiling and the iraqi troops had completely 
surrounded us mrs anderton 40 said from larkspur colo 
its the sort of thing where you make up your mind and you cant 
even feel anything until later your first responsibility is to 
your children 
at first kristine knutson wasnt sure what was best for her 
children 
from her kitchen window in kuwait the minnesota native with 
four children under the age of 8 could hear bombs and see 
helicopters swarming overhead 
mrs knutson who asked that her maiden name be used to protect 
her husbands identity waited more than a month before finally 
deciding that the only route she could take was out of the middle 
east 
the windows at our house were covered we couldnt answer the 
door or the telephone the kids had to stay indoors and it was 
so hot mrs knutson said in a telephone interview last week from 
minneapolis 
you couldnt find chicken eggs bread i heard the medical 
supplies were getting low too she said i just kept thinking 
i have to get my children out of here i knew i had to leave my 
husband 
now she like the other displaced mothers is thinking about how 
to make ends meet they are looking for jobs getting their kids 
into school pushing back frightening thoughts of their husbands 
for the sake of their kids 
at night we all sleep together the kids and me theyre 
wonderful but so little its not like snuggling up against your 
big husband said mrs alqallef i want my husband back

this is the world according to tim 
giago 
ellis island was a gateway for invaders 
tourists who visit pine ridge reservation his homeland in 
south dakota are constantly deanding to see the real indians 
at a powwow he witnessed in oxford mass participants dressed 
up in turkey feathers to improvise an indian ritual they had never 
learned 
there are so many misconceptions its going to take the rest 
of my life to get rid of them said giago 55 an oglala sioux 
who is the founding publisher of the awardwinning lakota times of 
rapid city sd 
giago is taking a break from daily reporting on american indians 
to spend a year as a nieman fellow at harvard university 
i have only one mission giago said i started a newspaper 
10 years ago because the media in the united states are totally 
ignorant of who we are and what we are if i relied on the 
mainstream press to do our story from our perspective it will 
never happen 
since the first nieman class of journalists in 1938 there have 
been 862 niemans giago is the programs first american indian 
print journalist there was one other american indian nieman in 
broadcasting 
fellows selected for the prestigious program spend a year at 
harvard studying whatever they wish and meeting in seminars this 
years class has 22 journalists half of them american 
giago said he hopes to enlighten his fellow scholars and the 
harvard staff on the indian perspective 
what i see here even its almost as if people believe that to 
be indian youre supposed to wear headdresses and live in a 
teepee giago said in a recent interview were locked in a 
certain time in history 
as a 17yearold navy recruit during the korean war giago was 
sent to california and put to work on a navy newspaper 
he later studied business and journalism at the university of 
nevada and worked for newspapers in new mexico and south dakota he 
became discouraged when editors said they didnt think he should 
cover indian matters because he might be biased 
giago said he recognized that before getting the indian 
viewpoint into the mainstream media it would be necessary to 
satisfy the needs of the countrys 14 million native americans 
his newspaper has a circulation of 11000 on 24 reservations in 
the dakotas montana and nebraska mine is a community newspaper 
that reports everything important to indian people he said 
indians often bring a different perspective to national events 
he said 
take the melting pot that was celebrated recently with the 
opening of an immigration museum in new york harbor at ellis 
island where immigrants poured into this country in search of 
freedom and opportunity 
ellis island doesnt mean a damn thing to the american 
indian giago said to us it was another form of invasion 
giago said he wants to establish a network of indian newspapers 
and expand the lakota times into a national publication 
for two years after he founded his newspaper the building was 
firebombed and its windows were shot out a gunman blasted the 
windshield of his car after he wrote editorials critical of 
militant indians 
giago said he has been enraged again and again by newspaper or 
tv coverage of pine ridge reporters catalog the problems of 
alcoholism poverty violence and unemployment but never dig deep 
enough to find the causes he said 
giagos columns won him the coveted hl mencken prize in 1985 
but he gave it back when menckens bigotry was revealed in the 
posthumous publication of his diaries 
now he has set himself the challenge of bringing the indian 
point of view to the genteel setting of harvard yard 
i dont come here as tim giago doing this as myself he 
said im here as a member of the oglala sioux tribe what i 
bring back will benefit the tribe

two decades ago illusionists siegfried amp roy 
were told to forget their dream of bringing their act to this 
entertainment capital because magic doesnt work in vegas 
now some 10000 shows and tens of millions of dollars later 
they are the architects of one of americas hottest attractions 
the top draw in a city of stars and are building on a dream to 
save the rare white tiger 
when siegfried amp roy take the stage at the mirage hotel monday 
night it will mark the 10000th live performance in the city they 
have adopted as their home by comparison the longest running show 
on broadway a chorus line closed this year after 6137 
performances 
today siegfried fishbacher and roy horn rank no 27 on forbes 
magazines list of highestpaid performers ahead of the likes of 
frank sinatra tom cruise and the rock group u2 theyre forecast 
to earn 28 million in the twoyear period ending in december 
but it was a different story 20 years ago when the two 
illusionists who met and formed their act on a cruise ship tried 
to break into the las vegas market 
dont tell me youre a magician because magic doesnt work in 
las vegas a jaded tropicana hotel official told the pair before 
reluctantly giving them a short contract 
all my confidence was gone siegfried said during an 
interview at the pairs walled estate where they keep a menagerie 
of animals used in their act and breed white tigers but when i 
performed here the first time i knew it was meant to be 
history has proven the pair right and their performance is 
proving mirage owner steve wynn something of a prophet 
wynn announced three years ago he was signing the pair to a 
575 million fiveyear contract as the star attraction when his 
new 630 million strip resort opened the mammoth pact prompted 
some skepticism of whether wynn could make their magic pay 
the skepticism was shortlived when siegfried amp roy began 
packing the new 1500seat 50 million theatre mirage two shows a 
night feb 1 the shows producer kenneth feld said siegfried amp 
roy will gross 30 million their first year at the mirage 
they spent eight months performing in japan in 198889 
the japanese really spoiled us roy said taking a break in 
a breakfast room overlooking a pool where some of their white 
tigers played after one performance they continued to applaud 
for an hour and eight minutes it was unbelievable 
the performers returned from japan for a recordbreaking stint 
at radio city music hall in new york city before heading back to 
las vegas 
the extravagant broadwaytype production mixes spectacular 
illusions such as a woman appearing to be turned into a 750pound 
white tiger with singing and dancing by a 170member cast but the 
show is not the only interest of the two stars 
preservation of the white tiger a beautiful animal first 
sighted in the himalayas 200 years ago and now nearing extinction 
is a major goal for siegfried amp roy 
in 1987 zoo officials said there were only about 100 white 
tigers in the world all were in captivity 
the white tigers are our living legacy roy said their 
collection of 23 whites including five snow white tigers is the 
largest in the world the performers have started an exchange 
program with a west german zoo and are working with the cincinnati 
zoo on a white tiger breeding program 
six rare white tigers were born while the performers were in 
japan three of them named red white and blue were born on july 
4 1989 
the white tigers romp and swim at their compound on the 
northwest side of las vegas and at an 80acre ranch on the 
outskirts of the city 
the animals also spend some time two or three at a time in an 
elaborate glassedin habitat at the mirage where millions of 
people have viewed the animals since the hotel opened in november 
1989 
siegfrieds most poignant memory 
when two white tigers were born at the entertainers compound 
and their mother sitarra placed each of the cubs in roys lap 
after they were born a touching display of trust between animal 
and man 
this was the most magical moment of my life siegfried said

south african president fw de klerk arrived 
sunday for talks with president bush on ways in which the united 
states can help that country bring about a peaceful transition to a 
nonracial system 
but the visit the highlight of which will be a lengthy white 
house discussion on monday has been clouded by an upsurge of 
violence that has claimed more than 750 lives in black south 
african townships in recent weeks 
still bushs encounter with de klerk is something of a 
milestone in ussouth african relations no south african head of 
state has visited washington since 1945 and the two countries were 
barely on speaking terms as recently as a few years ago 
de klerk said on arrival sunday he was bringing a message of 
hope for the future of his country and for all of southern africa 
we are proceeding irreversibly on the road to a new south 
africa where justice the guarantees of constitutional democracy 
and the rule of law will bring lasting peace and prosperity to all 
our people de klerk said 
his stay here ends tuesday night 
a senior administration official who briefed reporters on friday 
said the invitation to de klerk recognizes the bold leadership 
he has provided in seeking a way out of the apartheid era in south 
africa 
during the talks bush will explore what role the united 
states can play in helping to promote the negotiating process in 
that country said the official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
our interest is to promote a peaceful transition through 
negotiations to a postapartheid democratic nonracial south 
africa he said congress has approved 10 million to give 
impetus to the negotiating process 
the official said the visit was not designed to bring about an 
end to the economic sanctions the united states imposed against 
south africa in 1986 south africa has fulfilled some but not all 
of the requirements the legislation imposes for the sanctions to be 
lifted 
the sanctions included a ban on new us investment in south 
africa and suspension of landing rights for south african planes in 
the united states 
officials have said the sanctions can be lifted once south 
africas remaining political prisoners are released and the state 
of emergency is lifted in natal province emergency rule was ended 
elsewhere in south africa earlier this year 
de klerk said saturday before his departure from pretoria that 
the sanctions will not be a major focus of his visit 
im not going hat in hand with the particular objective of 
getting sanctions lifted he said 
de klerk will meet with congressional leaders but the 
congressional black caucus announced saturday it had canceled a 
scheduled meeting with de klerk saying only that the decision was 
in response to recent developments in south africa and after 
extensive consultation with antiapartheid activists 
the decision may have been related to the recent upsurge in 
violence in the black townships african national congress leader 
nelson mandela who was here in late june has held proapartheid 
security elements of the police and military responsible and said 
that americans should demand from de klerk an explanation for this 
situation 
south african officials themselves have not dismissed this 
possibility 
the lawyers committee for civil rights under law a private 
washingtonbased group has challenged de klerk to ensure that 
police and military assassination squads are fully exposed and 
completely disbanded

comedian rodney dangerfield says he just 
wants to make people laugh but lawyers for a casinohotel have 
portrayed him as a foulmouthed malingerer with a vindictive 
streak 
youre trying to make me out to be a liar and im not 
dangerfield said at one point during three days of often combative 
testimony in his 5 million lawsuit against caesars palace 
for the last two weeks dangerfield and caesars palace have been 
locked in a bitter court fight over an eye injury the comedian says 
he suffered in a steam bath when a burst of steam hit him in the 
face in march 1988 
jurors are expected to decide sometime this week whether the man 
who gets no respect suffered lasting eye damage or whether caesars 
which filed a countersuit should be compensated because he missed 
five shows 
the injuries were a figment of his fertile comedic 
imagination said caesars attorney louis meisinger who called 
the 68yearold comic a petulant performer in opening 
arguments 
dangerfield known for film comedies such as caddyshack and 
back to school as well as his standup act wasnt in a funny 
mood 
the last thing i wanted was to be involved in this he said 
im happy when im writing jokes and making people laugh 
dangerfield said he was determined to win his battle against the 
resort where he once starred before soldout audiences since the 
accident he has worked at ballys 
its very costly for me to do this but i had to do it because 
i know im right dangerfield said im not trying to get even 
with anybody but i wasnt treated right and i couldnt walk away 
from this 
dangerfield complained on the witness stand that caesars 
executives didnt fully believe he was injured in the incident 
following the opening night of a weeklong performance 
i was shocked at how they would handle this thing 
dangerfield testified i never heard of such a lack of compassion 
in my life 
he skipped four performances claiming his eyes were too 
sensitive to light to perform 
after returning for two shows he walked offstage without 
performing on closing night miffed at caesars for wanting to 
withhold his 45000ashow fee for the nights he missed 
i just couldnt be funny for these people said dangerfield 
who advised the showroom crowd of 1200 to get refunds even for 
any tips they gave showroom workers 
caesars introduced evidence showing dangerfield went to the 
fights one night he didnt perform and to see a comedy show 
another night 
a doctor who examined him after the steam incident said he 
thought dangerfield could perform 
eye specialists testified that symptoms dangerfield claims he 
has had since the accident first appeared in the mid1970s they 
said dangerfield may have hurt himself further by his repeated use 
over the years of a topical anesthetic used in surgery on his eyes 
if dangerfield thought he was treated roughly in court it could 
have been worse 
caesars attorneys filed documents with the court alleging he was 
a chronic drinker who frequently used marijuana and cocaine 
us district judge roger foley ruled against allowing evidence 
of substance abuse to be presented to jurors but allowed testimony 
that portrayed dangerfield as being in a drunken stupor following 
the accident 
the testimony came in the form of a deposition from an aspiring 
screenwriter jeffrey schimmel said he met dangerfield the day of 
the accident and stayed with him in new york for several months 
while they worked on a script 
schimmel who admitted having a fallout with dangerfield over 
the script testified that the comedian never complained of his eye 
injury and instead seemed to be on a vendetta against caesars 
he was very vindictive schimmel said he didnt care how 
much it cost or how much trouble it cost him he said it would cost 
them caesars a lot more he wanted to teach caesars palace a 
lesson

nelson mandela said sunday 
that new police measures in violenceplagued black townships were 
timed to create an appearance of calm during president fw de 
klerks trip to washington 
they pretend de klerk has put an end to the violence said 
mandela leader of the african national congress thats not 
true 
mandela also said anc president oliver tambo recovering from a 
stroke in sweden would attend an anc congress in south africa 
scheduled for dec 16 tambo has been in exile for more than 25 
years 
anc officials have said they dont expect tambo to resume full 
control of the organization mandela as deputy presidnet is 
considered the de facto leader 
de klerk arrived sunday in washington to begin a threeday trip 
he is the first south african leader in decades to visit the united 
states which has imposed economic sanctions to protest the 
apartheid system of racial segregation and white dominance 
south africa has embarked on a great journey de klerk said 
upon arrival it is a journey toward full democracy at home and 
abroad full participation in the family of nations 
de klerk has pledged to end apartheid and led the government in 
talks with the anc on powersharing 
his trip comes after weeks of violence in black townships around 
johannesburg that has killed about 800 people 
the fighting has pitted zulu supporters of the conservative 
inkatha movement against xhosas and other blacks linked to the anc 
it spread to the townships in early august from eastern natal 
province the traditional zulu homeland where 5000 blacks have 
died in five years of factional fighting 
police reported the townships quiet sunday continuing a lull in 
the violence but police said two offduty constables were stoned 
to death in a dispute with taxi drivers in natal it was not known 
if the killings were linked to the ongoing inkathaanc rivalry 
mandela and other black leaders have blamed police and soldiers 
for instigating the township fighting by using unnecessary force 
and siding with inkatha supporters the government denies the 
charges 
mandela also has warned that the governments failure to stop 
the fighting could jeopardize the peace talks which started in 
may 
but he said sunday the whiteled government and anc were 
compelled to work together through thick and thin for peaceful 
change in south africa 
another black opposition movement the radical panafricanist 
congress put off a decision on the governments invitation for 
direct talks on ending apartheid and sharing power with the black 
majority 
the group said sunday after a leadership meeting in zimbabwe its 
grassroots branches in south africa would make the decision 
before a national conference scheduled for november 
it has previously rejected proposed powersharing saying the 
only subject for negotiation was the transfer of power to blacks 
the new police measures codenamed operation iron fist 
included roadblocks weapons searches more police and military 
reinforcements and isolating flash points such as worker hostels 
and squatter camps with razor wire 
an overnight curfew in some black townships is scheduled to take 
effect tuesday 
some 3000 people marched saturday on municipal government 
offices in soweto to protest the police measures 
mandela has said the measures were intended to leave blacks 
powerless and would fail 
we hope the government will come to its senses to solve the 
violence not through iron fist but by putting their arms away 
he said sunday 
gerrit viljoen the minister of constitutional development said 
saturday the anc bears responsibility for the faction fighting and 
should stop blaming white authorities 
government officials said before de klerks departure that they 
believe the anc rejected the police measures to try to undermine 
the trip

openair mass in central ferrara john paul said the killing was a 
very grave incident of criminality which unfortunately adds to 
the list of many acts of violence committed recently in italy 
all italians i ask you at this moment to show firmness and 
courage to stem the growing threat coming from the culture of 
death the pope said

the crisis in the persian gulf has intensified 
a new american dilemma how a country can at once be a superpower 
and a superpauper 
experts agree the united states is the only nation that can 
project its military power throughout the world yet it also is the 
worlds largest debtor nation facing a staggering annual deficit 
and now the risk of recession 
paying the price for the international effort to squeeze iraq 
makes a difficult situation even worse and the bush 
administration signaled last week it would turn to unconventional 
means direct aid from allies 
no sooner had secretary of state james a baker iii and treasury 
secretary nicholas brady returned home with billions of dollars in 
allied aid pledges than a top state department official said 
president bush would rely increasingly on such approaches 
a kind of a new invention in the practice of diplomacy 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger described it i 
would expect you will see this administration approaching foreign 
policy questions more and more in that direction 
the shift was welcomed in congress where lawmakers are 
struggling to find room in a deficitridden budget to provide 
additional foreign aid to emerging democracies in eastern europe 
and central america 
its not a question of being mercenaries or 
rentasuperpower said sen richard lugar rind 
we are the only ones who can do this at this moment we 
are unique lugar said of massive usled effort against iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
some however questioned the new strategy 
this is a bandaid approach said robert kurz a former 
congressional foreign policy aide who now is at brookings 
institution its a very very shortsighted view of the nature of 
the crisis 
but that was not the prevailing view in congress as long as 
lawmakers maintain control of the purse strings 
rep david obey dwis acknowledged the need for outside help 
and said it may be necessary again in the future for limited 
purposes for a limited period 
obey added however that the dependence on other countries 
limits us flexibility he blamed it on budget deficits run up 
under the last administration that have left foreign capital to 
finance us debt the worlds largest 
the reagan budget deficits and trade deficits have drained 
this country of the ability to control its own policy and its own 
destiny he said 
whatever the cause the united states is confronted not only 
with the sudden costs of a massive military deployment in the gulf 
estimated at 15 billion over the coming year but with the need to 
help allies who have been militarily and economically threatened by 
the crisis 
in addition the united states owes some 500 million in unpaid 
past dues to the united nations an embarrassing situation at a 
time when bush has relied on the world body as the hub of his 
diplomatic efforts against iraq 
baker and brady returned home with 20 billion in pledges 
roughly half of that will go to aid countries harmed by the united 
nations embargo imposed against iraq the other half will go to 
offset us costs 
bush wants to forgive 67 billion in egyptian debt as a means 
of rewarding egyptian president hosni mubaraks leadership in the 
gulf crisis frontline states such as turkey and jordan have been 
hit hard economically by the iraqi embargo and israel is claiming 
the need for new weapons to maintain its security in the 
increasingly volatile region 
to some analysts using the solicitation of other countries as 
any kind of longterm method of financing foreign policy represents 
yet another evasion of american money problems 
we have a very strong interest in much higher levels of 
foreign aid and much lower levels of military spending said 
kurz of the brookings the world has changed but we are having a 
hard time accommodating to it 
the united states is the worlds only remaining superpower now 
that the soviet union is withdrawing from its empire and focusing 
on domestic problems kurz said it has the only military force 
which can be quickly projected around the world 
in the future threats to us interests are more likely to come 
from thirdworld conflicts such as the clash between iraq and 
kuwait than from the traditional bipolar rivalry with the soviet 
union he said 
it would be much cheaper to head off those problems through 
increased foreign aid and trade than to intervene militarily but 
the united states has not yet gotten used to the idea said kurz

the picket signs read no raise no work 
but for many of the 3000 teachers on strike in new orleans its a 
matter of toilet paper discipline and dignity 
when teachers strike you know its more than just the pay if 
all it was was money they wouldnt be teaching in the first 
place said mike stone an english teacher at mcmain magnet 
secondary school 
united teachers of new orleans which represents the new orleans 
parishs 4420 teachers and 1100 teachers aides and secretaries 
went on strike sept 17 the district kept schools open with 
substitutes and a little more than 1600 regular teachers who 
crossed picket lines last week on friday 62277 of the districts 
estimated 85000 students attended classes 
union officials say a dispute over who would bear the burden of 
400000 in health insurance costs the teachers or the district 
triggered last weeks walkout that has disrupted education in the 
states largest school district 
but new orleans parish teachers on the picket lines say the 
issues are not only increased insurance costs but poor working 
conditions discipline and the feeling that many parents regard 
them as overpaid baby sitters 
one picket at lafayette elementary school last week wrapped her 
sign in toilet paper dr williams yes its true we provide 
toilet paper heres some for you proclaimed the sign addressed 
to superintendent everett williams 
other teachers have complained of spending as much as 500 a 
year of their own money to buy paper workbooks and other 
instructional supplies 
district officials deny such charges 
i can assure you theres enough hand towels and toilet tissue 
in new orleans public schools teachers are not buying them out of 
their private funds in any numbers that i know of said the 
districts chief negotiator frank fudesco 
the reason is money school board spokesman henry joubert 
said flatly 
teachers also complained that the administration isnt backing 
them on discipline of students and wastes money on adminstrators 
who drive new cars equipped with telephones 
students are hitting teachers said ann legaux who teaches 
gifted children at fannie williams middle school do you think 
theyre going to be expelled as it says in the handbook no 
theyre back the next day 
district officials refused to discuss student discipline 
policies however the district said the cars in question are two 
years old are leased and needed by seven administrators whose jobs 
require regular visits to schools around the city 
before last weeks strike teachers had dropped earlier demands 
for 10 percent pay raises saying they would settle instead for 
having the district provide 1 million to cover half of a 
300perperson increase in health insurance costs management 
offered 600000 saying that was all the district could afford 
after the walkout teachers reinstated their demand for 10 
percent raises as well as the 1 million insurance package 
salaries range from 19455 for a starting teacher to 35111 
for someone with a doctorate and 25 years experience 
but the teachers insist the real issue is respect 
the real problem is the school board and top administration 
said ellen picou a school librarian were on the picket line 
here on claiborne avenue because the school board has no idea 
how teachers feel

western nations have become more receptive to 
japanese efforts to resume international lending to china which was 
halted in 1989 because of beijings brutal crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
our european friends expressed readiness to increase the 
possibility of loans to china said ryutaro hashimoto japans 
finance minister following a weekend meeting of the group of 
seven the worlds wealthiest industrial countries 
the group which includes the united states japan west germany 
britain france italy and canada commands decisive voting power in 
the world bank 
the g7 met in conjunction with this weeks annual meetings of 
the bank and its sister lending organization the 152nation 
international monetary fund 
hashimoto said the atmosphere at this meeting was decidedly 
different from last julys economic summit in houston when japanese 
prime minister toshiki kaifu said his government intended gradually 
to resume direct loans to beijing that were held up after 
suppression of the democracy movement 
hashimoto a member of kaifus cabinet said he told the group 
we should give forthcoming consideration to loans conducive to 
economic reform in china especially in areas related to protection 
of the environment 
the united states said it understood kaifus view that stability 
and reform should be promoted in china and that the worlds most 
populous country should not be isolated 
during these economic meetings there will be discussions 
about the future program and hopefully a quick normalization of 
bank lending activities in china said attila karaosmanoglu of 
turkey world banks vice president for asia 
we do hope the situation can be normalized in the not too 
distant future he added 
the group had said it would only support investments in china 
related to basic human needs the governments june 1989 crackdown 
with more than 2 billion worth of projects in the pipeline loan 
approvals in 1989 were limited to 590 million 
earlier this year however the same g7 expressed willingness 
to vote for financing basic human needs plus environmentrelated 
projects plus implementation of economic reforms karaosmanoglu 
said we are continuing with preparation of these projects he 
added 
chinas democracy crackdown coincided with an economic crisis in 
which purchasing power had outrun production and triggered 
inflation karaosmanoglu recalled 
since then he continued austerity measures have successfully 
curbed inflation and boosted exports and foreign exchange 
in a sense china is at a crossroads in the short run the 
problem is revival but the longrun question is how to reactivate 
the reform process karaosmanoglu said 
the world bank forecasts economic growth in china this year of 
35 percent to 45 percent compared to 2 percent last year he 
said

iraq said sunday it would destroy all 
middle east oil fields and move against israel if its people were 
strangled by foreign forces assembling in the persian gulf 
the statement urged the united states and other foreign powers 
to drop the language of threats and adopt a climate of 
understanding but it called iraqs annexation of kuwait an 
eternal decision 
we will never allow anybody whomever he may be to strangle 
the people of iraq without having himself strangled said a joint 
communique from the revolution command council iraqs highest 
decisionmaking body and the ruling baath party 
the oil areas in saudi arabia and in other states of the 
region all the oil installations will be rendered incapable 
and israel will be transformed into something different from what 
they are now said the statement broadcast by staterun radio 
baghdad and monitored in nicosia 
israel will be included in all actions that affect the owners 
of the homeland in which the forces of evil and occupation have 
settled it said apparently referring to saudi arabia 
it added then will be the flood 
the communique did not give details about what action could be 
taken by iraq it was issued following a joint meeting of the 
council and party earlier sunday presided over by iraqi president 
saddam hussein 
the statement lashed out at the usled military buildup in 
saudi arabia and surrounding waters that began after iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 iraq annexed the oilrich emirate six days later 
the troop buildup and subsequent unsupported sanctions 
imposed on iraq were reckless odious and foolish behavior it 
said 
kuwait has been restored to its people to be part of its 
original nation by an eternal decision from which there can be no 
retreat under any circumstances or conditions the ruling council 
and party said 
it repeatedly condemned the united states 
america is committing deep criminal acts against iraq and the 
arab nation especially in occuping the arab and moslem holy places 
in najd and hejaz saudi arabia and in its sanctions imposed 
aainst the iraqi people in a way that exceeds all humanitarian 
limits 
america did all this to satisfy its arrogance and enforce its 
hegemony on the entire world the statement said 
the statement insisted iraq would not accept any settlement to 
the gulf crisis unless it was based on saddams aug 12 peace 
initiative in which he called for an israeli withdrawal from 
palestinian territories 
america must realize clearly that it is pushing the entire 
region in fact even the whole world to the brink of a 
bottomless abyss from which the region will never see light for 
dozens of years it said

saudi arabia marked its 58th 
birthday sunday at a crossroads a time that finds it suddenly 
reshaping its relations in the middle east even as it deals with 
hosting thousands of western troops 
for a country that prides itself on slow methodical change the 
pace is dizzying and potentially dangerous 
at stake is the power structure of the middle east the flow of 
oil to the west and more personally for the saudi monarchy the 
degree to which the current crisis will foster change in a nation 
that seeks modernization without what it sees as the negative 
trappings of the west 
the alsaud monarchy known since its inception 58 years ago for 
its cautious handling of diplomatic matters moved aggressively 
saturday to punish jordan and yemen for not breaking with iraq over 
the invasion of kuwait 
riyadh expelled their diplomats and suggested they were 
assisting iraqi espionage in the kingdom 
we have decided it is time to burn bridges is how one saudi 
diplomatic official put it 
indeed as they burn bridges with their neighbors the saudis 
are trying to build them with the west and moscow and beijing as 
well but they are unsure how the current crisis will reshape their 
volatile region 
it would be convenient if we could wait until all this sorts 
itself out to decide which course to take another saudi official 
said sunday speaking on condition of anonymity but this is not 
a time for convenience we have waited far too long 
if nothing else saturdays expulsions appeared designed to put 
extraordinary pressure on jordan which relies on generous saudi 
aid to help its crippled economy 
saudi sources said the expulsions could soon be followed by a 
cutoff or sharp reduction in foreign aid in terms of its influence 
in arab affairs sauidi arabias position as aid donor is second 
only to its role as the custodian of islams holy places 
in amman jordanian officials have said the flow of saudi cash 
dried up almost immediately after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
but in the absence of official word from riyadh they hoped it 
might be resumed before too long 
it is unfortunate that much of our assistance has gone to 
wasteful things the saudi diplomatic official said we must be 
more careful about how we spend our money and who receives it 
that was not only a warning to jordan and yemen but to 
palestinians as well 
immediately after the invasion the saudi government suggested 
that palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafats 
support of saddam hussein would not affect the kingdoms generous 
aid to palestinians 
that posture has since changed several senior saudi officials 
have suggested that aid to the palestinians could be cut off or 
sharply reduced unless palestinian leaders break their ties with 
baghdad 
we are realizing that for too long we have gone to great 
lengths to avoid making tough choices the saudi diplomatic 
official said we must now make some and so must our supposed 
friends 
the remarkable breaks with yemen and jordan also serve as an 
admission that the government now realizes it can buy neither 
friends nor security simply by heaping billions in foreign aid on 
its neighbors 
the saudis now are promising lucrative assistance to reward the 
military help coming from egypt and syria the arab worlds two 
greatest military powers after iraq 
whether those new alliances will last is suspect and saudi 
arabia already is promising to improve its military which was 
woefully unprepared to deal with the iraqi invasion 
that effort will force the saudi monarchy to deal with nepotism 
which dominates the military and the role of women who because of 
the low saudi population likely will be needed to fill both 
military and civilian jobs 
saudi arabia also appears to have little choice but to be more 
open about its dealings with the west particularly the united 
states 
americans and other westerners have wielded considerable 
influence in saudi economic affairs since the discovery of oil here 
50 years ago the saudis have tried to keep the extent of these 
relationships under wraps 
in the past seven weeks however saudi arabia has had to open 
its doors to hundreds of foreign journalists who converged on the 
kingdom to report on the gulf crisis 
a saudi prince interviewed recently nodded his head virtually 
nonstop as he read a list of questions on domestic and 
international issues that king fahd was being forced to confront 
all at once 
that you are here to ask the questions is a sign itself of the 
rapid change he said and we must deal with this change but i 
have no answer today right now nothing is certain

with most of the 24th infantry division 
in saudi arabia the clip artists at curlys barber shop spend 
their days watching television and napping 
the deployment of 14000 gis from nearby fort stewart for what 
probably will be a lengthy mideast tour has already hurt businesses 
in hinesville and surrounding liberty county 
howard curly gainous sr 69 said his shop used to give 400 
haircuts a week but now is down to 50 or 60 
gainous and ed barfield 68 spend their days in the shop while 
the four other barbers check in periodically hoping for work 
i hope we get enough to hang on we have high rent and 
overhead gainous said 
an electric barber pole still spins outside the shop but 
gainous has turned off some lights in a back room to save money 
mayor buddy deloach said fast food sales have been cut by 50 
percent and house and apartment rentals are 30 percent below 
normal 
city officials wont know the full economic impact of the 
deployment until late october when this months sales tax receipts 
are tallied but deloach said there already are plans to delay 
capital improvements and equipment purchases 
some residents hope the army will move another division to fort 
stewart possibly from germany but military officials say there 
are no plans to bring another unit to the 780000acre post 
hinesville residents pride themselves on their patriotism and 
support for the military army families live throughout the town 
civilian and military residents socialize attend the same churches 
and work together in civic clubs 
fort stewart was just a sleepy southern army post until the 
division was activated there in 1974 since then the countys 
population has jumped from 18000 to 52000 
hinesville officials worried about a mass exodus of military 
families following the deployment but families with homes and 
schoolage children apparently have remained 
liberty county school enrollment is slightly higher this year 
8015 students cmmpared to 7995 last year 
ronald e tolley executive director of the liberty county 
industrial authority said the county has attracted several new 
industries that will help diversify the economy officials will try 
to boost slumping retail sales by attracting tourists and promoting 
hinesville as a regional shopping area 
tolley believes businesses that provided services to the young 
single soldiers will be especially hard hit hinesville has dozens 
of fastfood restaurants pawn shops and used car lots it also has 
at least nine barber shops several auto parts stores two major 
discount department stores and three large supermarkets 
i think theyre definitely feeling the impact said tolley 
you no longer see the military people in the stores 
donald bonett assistant store manager at the pigglywiggly 
supermarket said sales at his store have dropped 30000 to 
40000 a week managers have cut the hours of parttime workers 
our sales have dropped at least onefourth of what we used 
to do he said 
only 12 cars were parked at the 52room days inn motel on a 
recent night 
its very very slow said general manager mike patel we 
depend on the army 
patel said the housekeeping staff has been cut from seven to 
two the motel used to have an 80 percent occupancy rate he said 
if it stays like this for two months its going to be a 
problem for us we are losing money he said

many thought it was a joke when texas 
enacted taxes on illegal drugs but officials say the laugh is on 
drug dealers as they find themselves in deeper trouble because of 
the yearold al capone law 
the law requires all containers of illegal drugs to carry a tax 
stamp emblazoned with either a skull and crossbones or the image 
of the grim reaper and the words death and taxes 
the law requires a tax of 200 per gram on controlled 
substances 10150 per ounce or 350 per gram on marijuana 
since the tax took effect on sept 1 1989 more than 2550 drug 
stamps have been sold for 10614 presumably to collectors since 
the stamp would be prohibitively expensive in the illegal drug 
trade 
the law was never intended to be a source of revenue for the 
state it was always intended to give prosecutors another felony 
charge to put drug dealers behind bars said john bender deputy 
comptroller 
if we manage to collect some money from drug dealers in 
addition to that all the better for the state he said 
the state comptrollers office has billed 397 people more than 
180 million in unpaid drug taxes realistically the state will 
collect only a fraction of that amount 
but nearly 40000 has been collected from people who faced 
criminal tax evasion charges after they were arrested with drugs 
that did not have the state drug tax stamp 
under the law criminal tax evasion is a felony which carries a 
possible prison sentence of two to 10 years and officials can 
freeze a persons assets to collect the tax 
for 48yearold odis weaver of texarkana the law meant an 
additional 10 years for evading taxes on top of a 34year sentence 
for possession of cocaine in addition the state comptrollers 
office froze his bank account and collected 1800 
when state rep billy clemons introduced the drug tax bill in 
1987 i got laughed out of the house 
in 1989 he persuaded his colleagues that the tax could be 
enforced its nothing unusual anything we wish to discourage 
we tax 
he even dubbed it the al capone law after the 
prohibitionera gangster who was finally tripped up on federal 
income tax evasion charges and sent to prison 
the drug tax seems to be a pretty good tool when all else 
fails the evidence is irrefutable if you dont have the stamp you 
face a felony charge of tax evasion he said 
the success of the law will be determined by whether texas 
juries are willing to put drug dealers in jail for failure to pay 
taxes said sam ponder chief of criminal litigation at the bexar 
county district attorneys office 
but he added the people who are being charged have very 
little in the way of assets that can be seized for the payment of 
taxes most of the dealers charged typically have an apartment and 
car and live from one deal to the next

the worlds richest countries tried hard 
sunday to present a unified front against the threat that the 
persian gulf turmoil could plunge the world into a recession but 
signs of discord emerged from the closeddoor discussions 
finance ministers from britain west germany and france stressed 
the need for vigor in fighting inflation but the united states 
represented by treasury secretary nicholas brady continued to 
press its case that lower interest rates were needed to ward off a 
recession 
the discussions were being held as part of the annual meetings 
of the international monetary fund and the world bank the 
meetings which involve representatives from 152 nations gained 
more urgency this year as finance officials struggled to develop a 
strategy for dealing with the economic fallout from iraqs invasion 
of kuwait 
the finance officials endorsed the broad outlines of a usled 
effort to channel billions of dollars to countries hard hit by the 
persian gulf crisis those include the socalled frontline states 
of turkey egypt and jordan as well as other third world countries 
whose economies have suffered from the loss of markets stemming 
from the un trade embargo against iraq and the world rise in oil 
prices 
however british chancellor of the exchequer john major told 
reporters that decisions regarding specific amounts of assistance 
and how many countries should be helped remained to be worked out 
imf managing director michel camdessus has raised the 
possibility of establishing a voluntary fund with contributions 
coming from the windfall profits made by oilproducing nations 
those funds would be made available to the poorer oilconsuming 
nations officials said potential donor nations were to meet to 
discuss this fund on wednesday 
brady in a speech sunday to the policymaking committee of the 
imf continued to stress the us position that world financial 
leaders needed to be equally worried about inflation and recession 
he said successfully navigating policy to avoid both problems 
will be difficult but it is achievable 
but in their remarks other finance ministers left little doubt 
that they considered inflation to be the greater threat and thus 
would not be moving to lower interest rates 
without preservation of price stability we would lose on all 
fronts west german finance minister theo waigel said 
the clearer we make our antiinflationary determination the 
quicker we will reduce the risks of financial instability said 
french economics minister pierre beregovoy 
while the remarks were made in a closed meeting copies of the 
speeches were made available to reporters 
major who briefed reporters following his address said there 
is nothing to be gained and a great deal to be lost by easing up on 
inflation we have to get it down 
the position of the other countries is likely to make it more 
difficult for the administration to convince the federal reserve of 
the urgency of reducing us interest rates in the face of growing 
signs of economic weakness 
some analysts believe the shock to the us economy from the 
doubling in world oil prices since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
will result in a recession in this country beginning before the end 
of the year 
faced with this prospect the administration has been pressuring 
the fed to lower interest rates to spur economic activity however 
analysts said they were not looking for the fed to heed this call 
in view of the fact that interest rates in other countries have 
been rising 
the widening disparity between us and foreign interest rates 
has resulted in foreign investors pulling money out of the us 
market in favor of higher returns overseas if that trend 
accelerated it could trigger a sharp drop in the value of the 
dollar which would only worsen inflationary pressures in the united 
states 
the other finance leaders emphasized the need for the united 
states to do something to get its federal budget under control the 
worlds seven richest countries the united states japan west 
germany britain france canada and italy specifically mentioned 
the us deficit problem in a joint communique issued late 
saturday 
in his speech sunday brady sought to allay fears that the 
current negotiations between congress and the administration will 
fail to craft a credible deficit reduction agreement 
his comments appeared aimed at calls for congress and the 
administration to abandon the grammrudman deficit reduction 
targets because the 50 billion in deficit reduction being 
contemplated for the 1991 budget year would be too great a shock on 
an already weak economy

americanborn queen noor said sunday her 
husband is a loyal friend of the west an experienced mediator for 
peace and an honorable man who is being misrepresented in the 
united states and pressured to take sides 
there has been a lot of disinformation about his motives 
said queen noor born lisa halaby of washington dc in an 
interview it has been very disturbing 
although king hussein has called on iraq to withdraw its troops 
from kuwait he has generally sided with his powerful neighbor 
saddam hussein while still trying to promote peace negotiations 
on saturday he appealed to the united states to withdraw its 
troops from saudi arabia as soon as possible 
queen noor did not provide specific examples of disinformation 
but her husbands reluctance to sever trade links with iraq mainly 
for economic considerations has sparked us accusations that he 
has become an apologist for saddam 
since his coronation in 1953 hussein 54 has been one of 
washingtons closest arab allies 
like their queen a princetoneducated daughter of a prominent 
airline executive many jordanians now feel betrayed by the united 
states 
people have this attitude that you are either with us or you 
are against us but this is an attitude that has never worked 
the 39yearold queen said in the interview at almaawa palace 
overlooking the bustling capital 
it has never been a responsible or constructive position in 
international relations ive seen this attitude in the united 
states and of course in this region as well 
the feeling is that if jordan doesnt declare its position to 
be the same as that of the other country it is against them and 
that it is in another camp she added not directly naming the 
united states 
jordan hasnt chosen a camp she said jordan has had its 
role throughout history of being a crossroads it is geographically 
a crossroads and in politics it has been a mediator it has been a 
force for peace and stability working always for that 
on saturday king hussein took his positions to the american 
people in a 30minute speech broadcast on cable news network he 
appealed to the united states to support negotiations rather than 
driving toward a horrible war 
we believe that the position of jordan could not be clearer to 
anyone who seeks the truth it is based on the principles of 
international law which jordan has respected and always calls on 
all nations to respect he said 
jordan is paying a terrible price for its commitment to honor 
principles justice and peace he said 
like her husband queen noor said the crisis clarified the need 
to resolve the arabisraeli conflict 
it does nothing for the credibility of the west in this region 
to see so much emphasis placed on un resolutions concerning oil 
producing states in the region and nothing like the same 
emphasis being placed on longstanding disputes that threaten 
regional peace and stability such as the arabisraeli dispute 
there are resolutions concerning that dispute that have 
existed for 23 years and have not been implemented she said 
arabs queen noor said consider the us refusal to negotiate 
the israeli occupation of palestinian territories inconsistent and 
unjust 
injustice strikes at the heart of people at their most 
intense passions she said

secretary of state james a baker iii played 
down the possibility of war in the persian gulf on sunday saying 
the united states and its allies still have a whole host of 
nonmilitary options to use against iraq 
but baker said the bush administration would unleash an 
appropriate response to any iraqiinspired acts of terrorism 
against american citizens president bush made similar comments 
friday and has accused iraq of supporting terrorist groups 
baker appearing on nbctvs meet the press program also 
said the administration likely will present to congress the first 
phase of its proposed weapons package for saudi arabia early next 
week 
administration sources have said the initial deal is expected to 
have a value of 10 billion but baker refused to put a price tag 
on it there have been reports that the total deal was worth 
roughly 21 billion a figure baker would not confirm 
baker said the first installment of saudi weapons deal 
represents the needs that we think are immediate for saudi arabia 
and frankly needs that would that will serve to protect 
american lives 
the pentagon and the state department were putting the final 
touches on the first phase of the military shopping list for the 
saudis over the weekend officials said 
the package is likely to include tow antitank missiles patriot 
antiaircraft systems and f15 fighter jets according to sources 
familiar with the deal 
the second installment will not be presented to congress for 
approval until early 1991 baker said 
despite the 150000 us troops in saudi arabia and the billions 
of dollars of materiel in the desert kingdom baker said the united 
states remains committed to working with the united nations for a 
peaceful diplomatic resolution 
asked if he is confident war can be avoided baker said we 
have said many times we hoped there wont be bush however 
will not rule and indeed should not rule out other options 
he said 
baker refused to discuss a report in sundays washington post 
that said the defense department had contingency plans for ground 
assaults against iraq from as many as four directions the troops 
might have to cross jordan and turkey the report said 
saying he would not talk about any possible operations baker 
added that as long as military action remains an option youre 
going to see speculative pieces from time to time like this 
baker said the un had a whole host of other things that 
might be considered in an attempt to force iraq to withdraw its 
troops from kuwait and restore that countrys government he 
reiterated those conditions must be met before there would be talk 
of negotiating with iraq 
i dont think we are running out of nonmilitary type 
sanctions baker said 
bakers measured tone on iraq contrasted with a bellicose 
statement from baghdad on sunday threatening to destroy oil fields 
in the middle east and move against israel if the iraqi people are 
strangled by foreign forces in the persian gulf the statement 
was issued in the name of the revolution command council the 
countrys highest decisionmaking body 
baker said the united states was committed to backing the un 
resolutions imposing trade embargoes against iraq baker said the 
secretary of state will join other foreign ministers this week at a 
un security council meeting in new york 
one of items on the agenda is imposing an air embargo against 
iraq to tighten the stranglehold on baghdad another possible 
sanction is to punish countries that break the embargo 
un secretary general javier perez de cuellar said sunday that 
its likely that an air embargo will be adopted by the united 
nations in the next few days 
the administration agreed to the phased sale of weapons to saudi 
arabia after some members of congress particularly those with 
close ties to israel objected to the massive flow of weapons to 
the saudis 
baker insisted the administration had not caved in to congress 
although the idea of a twostep process originated on capitol hill 
fred dutton a representative of the saudi government said the 
saudis were not upset about the twopart sale 
after the smoke clears they will see what their defense 
requirements are dutton said in a telephone interview if the 
united states refuses to sell weapons to the saudis they will do 
their shopping elsewhere he said 
baker also defended the administrations actions prior to 
saddams invasion of kuwait he reiterated that the united states 
followed the proper course in refusing to take sides in the 
iraqkuwait border dispute and said it was ludicrous to 
suggest that somehow the united states contributed to saddam 
husseins unprovoked aggression against kuwait

patriarch alexi ii head of the russian orthodox 
church led a divine liturgy in the kremlins uspensky cathedral on 
sunday the first full service allowed in more than 70 years in 
russias most important cathedral 
before the 1917 revolution the 15th century church was the most 
sacred in the country under its five golden onionshaped domes 
czars were crowned patriarchs were buried and conquered princes 
swore allegiance to russia 
since 1918 however it has been a museum and closed to ordinary 
worship the governments decision to allow the sunday service was 
an important symbolic step in the revival of the orthodox church 
long repressed by the communist party because of ideological 
opposition to religion 
about 1000 people were allowed into the kremlin the walled 
fortress that is the seat of the soviet government for the 
service 
among them were moscow mayor gavriil popov and the chairman of 
the national legislature anatoly lukyanov 
afterward thousands of people lined the streets as alexi and 
other church leaders led a procession from the kremlins trinity 
gate through downtown moscow to another historic site the church 
of the great ascension 
churches are revived not by external restoration but by 
prayers said inside them alexi told the crowd outside i hope 
you will agree with me that todays divine liturgy in the uspensky 
ctahedral meant more to its spiritual revival than decades of 
external maintenance 
more than 30 clergymen in golden brocade robes many carrying 
icons took part in the hourlong procession they were followed by 
hundreds of worshipers 
people watched from balconies and windows and were packed four 
deep on both sides of the 2mile route the crowd was quiet and 
respectful and some spectators crossed themselves as the icons

russian script carried by some of the marchers 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has shown much more 
tolerance than previous leaders for worshipers and has called on 
them to support his reform policies 
three years ago gorbachev met in the kremlin with alexis 
predecessor pimen it was the first meeting between leaders of the 
communist party and the russian orthodox church in more than 40 
years 
since then numerous churches across the soviet union have been 
returned to the orthodox church and restored for worship in prior 
decades some were maintained as cultural museums but many were 
allowed to fall into disrepair and were used as storehouses or 
offices 
since the bolshevik revolution brief prayer services have been 
allowed in the uspensky cathedral on a few occasions such as in 
1988 for the 1000th anniversary of the introduction of 
christianity to russia 
but sundays service which was closed to the press was the 
first full one there since 1918 according to the newspaper 
komsomolskaya pravda officially the occasion for the service was 
a local holiday the days of moscow which celebrates the beauty of 
the capital 
there are three other major churches within the kremlin where 
services have been held on rare occasions all are considered 
museums but there has been speculation that one or more may soon 
be opened for weekly services 
there has been talk for a long time about returning the 
kremlin churches to use as cathedrals komsomolskaya pravda 
wrote maybe the service on the citys holiday is one more step 
on the path that leads to the church

says a staff reporter broke no law when he was arrested for 
allegedly contributing to the delinquency of a minor while working 
on a story for the newspaper and called the police action 
unwarranted 
based on the information we have the arrest of a washington 
post reporter while he is reporting a story and breaking no law 
himself appears unwarranted to us said leonard downie jr 
managing editor of the post 
im particularly concerned that the police pursued this after 
the reporter identified himself and his purpose and that the police 
took his notes downie said 
michael j ybarra 23 a reporter with the posts metro staff 
was arrested late friday while working on a report about a new 
curfew for minors in quantico va 
ybarras supervisors said the reporter was not available for 
comment concerning the incident 
ybarra was taken into custody and his notes confiscated while 
conducting an interview of two 12yearold boys in a restaurant in 
the virgina town about 30 miles south of the nations capital

curfew for youths under age 18 following recent vandalism in the 
area 
ybarra is the second adult charged in connection with a curfew 
violation but no youths have been arrested 
i believe that the reporter was trying to do his job and just 
got mixed up at the wrong place and the wrong time said leo 
rodriguez quantico police chief 
rodriguez said the reporters notes were held as evidence but a 
copy would be made available to the post 
ybarra who was released on his own recognizance is to be

britain and hong kong on sunday 
welcomed vietnams decision to take back boat people who are not 
opposed to returning home from hong kong camps 
the official vietnam news agency said the agreement was reached 
in talks in hanoi last week by british and hong kong officials and 
representatives of the un high commissioner for refugees 
the brief report dated saturday and seen in bangkok on sunday 
did not say if the agreement applied to the tens of thousands of 
boat people stuck in camps in thailand malaysia indonesia and 
other asian countries 
under the terms of the july 1989 geneva conference all boat 
people are screened in order to determine which refugees are 
eligible for resettlement in the west those who fled to escape 
political persecution are eligible those who left for economic 
reasons are not 
the new agreement is seen as a compromise that stops short of 
forced repatriation fiftyone vietnamese were repatriated against 
their will in december bt no others have been forced back because 
of objections from the united states and vietnam 
hong kong and the association of southeast asian nations 
thailand singapore indonesia malaysia the philippines and 
brunei continued pressuring vietnam and threatened to turn back 
vietnamese boats unless the united states eased its stand 
in late july secretary of states james a baker iii told 
southeast asian nations that the united states continued to oppose 
forced repatriation but could accept the new category of those 
who do not object 
in london a foreign office official said the agreements reached 
in hanoi were an important step 
our objective remains the repatriation of all screenedout boat 
people to vietnam the official said we will be cooperating 
fully with the un high commissioner for refugees in the 
implementation of agreements 
in hong kong the governor sir david wilson also described the 
agreement as an important step to accelerate the return of 
nonrefugees to vietnam 
wilson told reporters he hopes the repatriation program will 
begin before the end of this year adding you cannot have people 
who are nonrefugees spending year after year in camps that is 
simply not right 
so far 4349 vietnamese boat people have returned from hong 
kong under a voluntary repatriation program that began in march 
1989 with support from the un high commissioner for refugees 
about 54000 boat people remain in hong kong camps about 9000 
are classified as refugees and will be resettled in the west the 
other 45000 are either waiting to be screened for determination of 
their status or have been classified as nonrefugees for 
repatriation 
since june 1988 when hong kong stopped automatically allowing 
boat people to stay 49466 have arrived there 4916 of them this 
year

two moslem members of the us 
military often think about having to go to battle in the region 
that holds what they consider the holiest place in the world 
meekail shaheed 26 and abdullah shamsiddeen 38 are both air 
force sergeants and practicing moslems 
the two men express concern for fellow members of the military 
who also are members of the sunni islamic faith they say they are 
a little wary of the huge foreign military force that is inside 
saudi arabia site of islams holiest place the city of mecca 
any time you get forces close to any kind of holy land 
religious people are going to be concerned shaheed said 
but both say they would have no reservations about serving in 
the multinational force there 
not at all said shamsiddeen a 13year military man who 
converted to islam 17 years ago i believe we would be being 
going over there in the name of right we would not be going over 
there to destroy something but to protect and defend 
at robins both men perform administrative duties in the base 
chapel their jobs allow them time to carry out their islamic 
duties which include five daily prayers and yearly fasts during 
the month of ramadan 
the chaplains are out front in respecting and protecting the 
freedom of all religions here on base said shamsiddeen i 
would hope that moslems in other areas would have the same 
protection and freedom 
both men say they are encouraged by changing public attitudes 
toward their religion partly because of events in the middle east 
people seem to be more supportive of islam now said 
shamsiddeen noting that several islamic countries are allied with 
western forces against iraqs invasion of kuwait 
still the two men watch events in the middle east with 
trepidation one of the five pillars of islam is for a moslem to 
visit mecca at least once in ones life 
shamsiddeen made the pilgrimage in 1979 but shaheed has not 
yet had the opportunity 
we all hope this can be taken care of as quickly as 
possible he said

students and national leaders rail 
against the american military presence in the philippines despite 
opinion surveys that show sizable public support for the us 
bases 
no prominent politician unequivocally supports the bases which 
us officials claim pump 1 billion a year into the economy and 
provide 100000 jobs in a nation facing political instability and a 
possible recession 
the philippines has much to gain from the presence of us 
bases but the opposition to them illustrates how much some 
filipinos fear continued influence by their old colonial rulers 
you must understand that other asian peoples the 
singaporeans and japanese and the koreans can deal easier with 
the americans because you were never their colonial master said 
one asian diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
for the filipinos its different he said the old 
relationship of ruler and the ruled is a heavy psychological 
burden 
angry students last week backed a pullout chanting us bases 
out in demonstrations near the us embassy american officials 
warned of bombings and assassinations by antibases extremists 
during four days of talks on the bases last week no filipino 
politician of national status expressed complete support for 
retaining them after their lease expires in september 1991 the 
talks adjourned friday and were expected to resume in about a 
month 
president corazon aquino said the united states and the 
philippines should discuss the orderly withdrawal of the 40000 
us troops defense department civilians and military dependents 
at clark air base the subic bay naval base and four smaller 
facilities 
mrs aquino said sunday in her weekly radio broadcast that she 
felt confident our two countries shall arrive at an understanding 
that will be mutually acceptable and mutually beneficial 
antibases sentiment is strongest in the educated urban middle 
class that produces university professors journalists and other 
opinionmakers activists are convinced that building opposition to 
the bases is simply a matter of educating their uninformed 
countrymen 
a survey in march by the ateneo university found that 35 percent 
of the 1200 filipinos polled nationwide were unaware that the 
united states maintains bases here 
only 18 percent wanted the bases either phased out or closed 
immediately forty percent supported keeping them indefinitely 
closing the bases represents an assertion of sovereignty against 
the united states which many filipinos believe still exerts 
powerful influence over their country more than 40 years after 
independence 
over the years filipino nationalism has come to be defined 
as standing up to america and its most visible symbol the bases 
support for the bases would brand a politician as 
antinationalist an unpatriotic tool of the former colonial 
power many filipinos believe the united states interferes in 
philippine affairs to guarantee keeping the bases 
that view was reinforced by washingtons longtime support for 
the late president ferdinand marcos despite alleged us 
sponsorship of democracy the americans tolerated marcos 
repressive rule apparently to maintain their bases 
opposition to marcos therefore took on the added character of 
opposition to the bases many of those in the forefront of the 
antimarcos struggle now hold key positions in the administration 
the congress and the media 
the bases have become so symbolic of american intervention 
that any us move is seen as a bid to retain the installations 
in december us jets flew air cover for proaquino forces 
against military mutineers seeking to topple her that was widely 
interpreted as a bid to pressure her into keeping the bases 
during a devastating earthquake in july us troops rushed to 
stricken cities to help in relief operations residents of the 
quakestricken city of cabanatuan joked that the bases would remain 
forever because the government simply could not function without 
them 
the current talks between the philippines and the united 
states should usher in a new relationship between the two 
countries said rev joaquin bernas president of ateneo 
university 
for the philippines it should be a major step in the 
direction of greater selfreliance and not continuing dependency

salman rushdies first book since iran called for 
his death is a fairy tale for children acclaimed by critics sunday 
as a charming and lighthearted work with a serious message for 
adults as well 
reviewers marveled that rushdie could write with such 
mischievous humor despite 19 months in hiding under police guard 
during which he has moved constantly and become separated from his 
wife the american novelist marianne wiggins 
most critics however also saw signs of pain and desperation in 
the prose of haroun and the sea of stories 
the late ayatolah ruhollah khomeini called for rushdies death 
after the authors novel the satanic verses was deemed 
blasphemous to islam 
the new book tells the tale of a hindu storyteller whose talent 
is suddenly destroyed by a fanatical dictator who poisons the 
springs of his inspiration his brave son haroun eventually 
defeats the enemy of stories and restores his fathers gift 
rushdie dedicates the book to his own son with these lines 
as i wander far from view 
read and bring me home to you 
british writer anthony burgess reviewing the book in the 
observer newspaper said the dedication renews rage at the 
stupidity of the islamic deathmongers burning a book they do not 
have the intelligence to understand 
burgess called it a great tribute to the resilience of mr 
rushdies beleaguered spirit that he should write so charmingly 
funny a book 
it is a book to enjoy and not to explicate but if we wish we 
can take it as a piece of swiftian outrage at human folly disguised 
as a childrens tale burgess wrote 
rushdie a british citizen born into a moslem family in india 
was sentenced to death feb 14 1989 even after khomeinis death 
last year the sentence was not lifted by iranian leaders 
rushdie has since published poetry and several essays and 
reviews but haroun and the sea of stories is his first book 
since he went into hiding 
it will be published by granta books in britain sept 27 and in 
the united states next year 
graham lord literary editor of the sunday express said rushdie 
has managed during his awful captivity to write a remarkably 
lighthearted almost mischievous childrens book 
but lord found poignant autobiographical shadows of rushdies 
own dreadful predicament especially in the remark of one 
character who said happy endings are much rarer in stories and 
also in life than most people think 
coming from rushdie in apparently unending captivity that 
sounds like a desperate cry echoing in the dark lord said 
david hughes in the mail on sunday said salman rushdie the 
flags of merriment flying throughout his allegory wins a grim 
fight of his own his fine book written in conditions in which 
such ebullience of mood takes courage is a great reechoing cry 
for freedom of word and view for the inarguable truth in a good 
story 
writer and critic marina warner reviewing the book in the 
sunday times which published several excerpts said rushdies 
jauntiness under sentence of death is matter for wonder 
enough but what is even more so is the absolutely unpompous 
treatment of the villains in the story 
rushdie meditates on compromise on the sympathy of opposites 
the symbolic beauty of silence and the night as well as their 
terrors she wrote

seven weeks after the united 
nations imposed sanctions on iraq military equipment and other 
material with war potential continues to slip through the naval 
web us officers said sunday 
the officers said shipments marked for delivery to the jordanian 
port of aqaba are actually being taken overland to iraq 
the amount and type of cargo passing through aqaba is classified 
information but officers familiar with the situation indicate the 
flow has been fairly extensive they say their suspicions are based 
partly on confidential intelligence data 
one cargo vessel intercepted by the us navy within the past 
week carried britishmade land rovers painted in military 
camouflage they said they said they could not reveal where the 
cargo was coming from 
another ship was carrying a load of scrap metal aluminum 
silica and other materials that are basic components in the 
manufacture of explosives one officer said 
in both cases the cargoes were listed on the ships manifests 
as bound for aqaba and there was no way for american boarding 
parties to determine whether they were ultimately destined for 
iraq about a 350mile trip by road the officers said 
we suspect thats where some of the stuff labeled for aqaba is 
going but we dont have proof said capt paul prokop commander 
of us coast guard teams taking part in the multinational effort 
to enforce the un sanctions 
there are a lot of ways for an innovative shipper to avoid a 
blockade and as the price goes up they become more innovative 
he added 
jordan insists it is abiding by the embargo even though it faces 
economic devastation king hussein has called for iraq to withdraw 
from kuwait but has generally sided with baghdad since the aug 2 
invasion 
officials in aqaba said the port is at a near standstill because 
of the sanctions with the number of arriving ships dwindling from 
about 25 a day to two or three aqaba jordans only seaport is 
normally a major transit point for iraqbound goods 
the un security council imposed an economic embargo in 
response to the iraqi invasion the council later approved the use 
of minimal force to prevent ships from trading with iraq 
the effort is far from being airtight as any observer is well 
aware if the powers that be are going to have this effort as 
airtight as they want someones going to have to speak to our 
friends in jordan said prokop 
as of sunday officers said the us navy had conducted 1251 
interceptions of mechant ships since sanctions were imposed aug 6 
of these 880 were in the gulf of oman arabian sea and the 
persian gulf with 371 in the red sea the route for the narrow 
gulf of aqaba and the jordanian port 
but the pattern of activity is reversed when it comes to 
boardings of 105 boardings to date 80 to 90 were in the red sea 
ships from about eight other navies including the british 
french italian and australian are also participating in 
interdiction operations 
the warship crews ask all passing merchant vessels to name their 
ports of origin destination and cargo 
if there are suspicions a ship may be carrying cargo to or from 
iraq or occupied kuwait it is asked to allow a boarding party to 
inspect the manifest and cargo if the cargo is found to be 
iraqirelated the ship is instructed to divert to another port 
there have been six such diversions so far the officers said 
in three other instances warning shots were fired to force ships 
to stop and be searched 
us officers say their warships have the option of shooting to 
disable a ship tht defies challenge so far that has not 
happened

levy said his meeting with shevardnadze was arranged last week 
in moscow by an israeli foreign ministry delegation

insists on negotiating directly with arab governments

this week and hear about the talks baker held in syria and saudi 
arabia earlier this month on the persian gulf crisis and related 
issues

president cesar gaviria faced with a 
hostage crisis blamed on the medellin cocaine cartel told 
colombians sunday his government would not negotiate with drug 
traffickers 
gavirias administration has tried to hush press reports about 
the hostages seven journalists and the sister of a colombian 
ambassador the government has yet to acknowledge they are being 
held by the medellin cartel and has forbidden radio news coverage 
of such unconfirmed reports 
but the cartel claimed responsibility for three of the eight 
kidnappings over the past few weeks in a statement faxed to local 
news media last week newspapers have quoted security officials as 
saying the statement is authentic 
and local newspapers have cited reliable cartel sources as 
saying all eight kidnapping victims are in the traffickers hands 
in a letter published sunday in bogotas el espectador 
newspaper the president addressed questions about how he is 
handling his first crisis since taking office on aug 7 
a saturday editorial had voiced the doubts of many colombians by 
asking if the government was surreptitiously conversing with drug 
traffickers 
gaviria answered with a resounding no 
everything can be presumed except that the government is 
carrying on a dialogue or maintaining whatever type of contact with 
criminal organizations the president said in his letter to the 
newspaper 
the recent string of kidnappings ended a nearly twomonth break 
in the cartels terrorist campaign the medellin traffickers 
declared a unilateral ceasefire in the campaign last july saying 
they wanted to demonstrate their desire for peace 
bombings and other attacks by the cartel had killed more than 
500 people in the year before the truce was declared 
earlier this month gaviria offered traffickers an incentive to 
turn themselves in 
he said traffickers who surrender would be tried in colombia 
rather than extradited to the united states he also offered 
reduced prison sentences for drug suspects in exchange for their 
cooperation with authorities 
last weeks statement by the medellin cartel said gavirias 
offer was unacceptable instead traffickers say they want a full 
amnesty for past crimes

the middle east crisis must not be allowed to 
overshadow or hinder the longterm battle against world poverty 
the chairman of an international financial committee said sunday 
bernard chidzero chairman of the development committee of the 
world bank and the international monetary fund said the 
possibility of worldwide inflation and high interest rates 
triggered by iraqs takeover of kuwait will affect discussions of 
the group on monday 
but he said the worlds greatest challenge is still the 
eradication of poverty the development committee is made up of 
finance ministers and other officials from 22 countries who advise 
the bank and the fund on the transfer of resources to developing 
countries 
one billion people either live in poverty or on the brink of 
poverty said chidzero who is also finance minister of zimbabwe 
i do not believe we can build a safe and stable world when we 
have hundreds of millions of people living without shelter or 
dying of hunger he said at a news conference 
he criticized rich nations for expecting developing countries to 
open up trade barriers while they refuse to adopt more liberal 
policies themselves 
but chidzero said it is becoming more difficult for poor nations 
to maintain a unified voice in trade negotiations since some are 
more successful than others at achieving growth 
he said that although newly emerging democracies in eastern 
europe have some similarity with the developing countries of the 
world their history location and racial ties to developed 
countries give them an advantage in pushing towards development

the leader of the rightwing national front party 
said sunday the trade embargo against iraq was beneath the 
international community and warned the persian gulf crisis could 
spur new waves of immigration 
it is unworthy of civilized nations to want to starve the 
iraqi population just as it is unworthy to want to destroy it by 
bombings jeanmarie le pen told several thousand followers at 
the close of the partys annual festival 
le pen has been often criticized for alleged antisemitic 
remarks and his strong stance against immigrants particularly 
those from arab nations 
since the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait le pens comments 
against western intervention led to some defections from his party 
which holds one seat in the 577member national assembly 
le pen said the gulf crisis would lead to increased immigration 
unemployment and other economic problems in france 
it is not iraq which is responsible for the rising price of 
oil le pen said the responsibility lies with the blockade 
organized by western nations 
the un security council on aug 6 approved the trade embargo 
which is being enforced by ships from the united states france and 
other nations 
le pen a member of the european parliament also blamed the 
french government for threats to french citizens trapped in kuwait 
and iraq he claimed the worlds major powers knew iraq was 
planning to invade kuwait 
so it was with full knowledge that the french government left 
french citizens behind as hostages he said 
paris mayor jacques chirac was criticized for allowing the 
national front party festival to convene in a section of the bois 
de boulogne park on the western edge of paris 
more than six towns have banned national front gatherings since 
the may 10 desecration of a jewish cemetery in carpentras in 
southern france authorities accused le pen of indirect 
responsibility 
the natonal front formed in 1984 has the support of about 15 
percent of french voters according to polls earlier this year

reason to join the ifc because there was no room for the private 
sector 
earlier this year the romanian parliament agreed to grant 30 
percent of stateowned corporations to the public with a voucher 
system that would distribute shares to each adult citizen the 
remaining 70 percent would be sold in shares to romanian and 
foreign investors stolojan said 
the first challenge for the international agency he said will 
be to help romania develop a stock market there is also great 
potential for a tourist industry he said 
we are firm in our decision to go to a market economy the 
finance minister said at a joint news conference with ifc director 
douglas gustafson who said a team would be sent to romania to see 
how the country can be helped in its efforts to develop more 
private enterprise 
gustafson said it was too early to predict how much financing 
would be needed he said the organization would start by providing 
technical assistance 
the ifc he said could help create private sector activity 
financial markets and joint ventures 
mugur isarescu governor of the national bank of romania said 
the country also plans to develop a fullfledged central bank and a 
private banking system but needs more skilled personnel 
isarescu said there would be difficulties changing from the 
command economy developed under 45 years of communist rule 
which ended with free elections in may following the december 1989 
overthrow of dictator nicolae ceausescu 
i dont think it is possible to just say bingbang and have 
a market economy isarescu said 
the romanian officials said signs of progress are already 
apparent in the country with more than 4000 small enterprises 
operating and thousands more insidethefamily businesses 
last easter stolojan said romanians for the first easter in 20 
years could buy eggs in the market because of the development of 
agricultural businesses on unused land deeded to individuals by the 
state

raccoons who snack on twinkies oreos and 
big macs suffer the same consequences as humans rotten teeth and 
high cholesterol researchers say 
scientists say they were shocked by results from a small 
sampling of the masked mischiefmakers that roam illinois parks and 
campgrounds scavenging human food 
their mouths look like those pictures in the dentists office 
that show what will happen if you dont brush said laura 
hungerford a university of illinois veterinarian i think they 
have a lot of sugar in their diet 
wild raccoons usually have healthy teeth but hungerford found 
broken teeth gum disease and cavities in the campground animals 
many park raccoons also had cuts on their faces and paws a few 
suffered broken legs 
raccoons are aggressive for food hungerford said the 
injuries probably are related to digging through trash cans or 
getting hit by swinging garbage can lids 
in the wild raccoons eat berries grass small fish and rodents 
theyre not particular researchers dont know specifically what 
kinds of human food the racoons are eating because theyre not 
choosy 
theyre omnivores that will eat anything from bugs to 
pizza said charles nixon a wildlife biologist at the illinois 
natural history survey which is cooperating in the study with the 
university of illinois and western illinois university 
the early findings from a survey this spring prompted a more 
thorough investigation now underway of how raccoons interact with 
people 
researchers will trap and examine 100 raccoons this fall half 
in siloam springs state park in western illinois and half in the 
wilds of brown county after about 12 hours they will be returned 
to the wild 
in addition to mouth and body examinations the raccoons blood 
will be tested for any diseases that could be shared with humans 
the researchers who are examining whether racoons may transfer 
diseases to humans or vice versa have already have found that some 
snacking raccoons suffer high cholesterol levels 
this is important because humans are using recreational areas 
more and more bringing humans and raccoons into more intimate 
contact hungerford said 
park officials already have modified many trash containers so 
raccoons cannot get into them easily and arent as likely to be 
injured trying but the animals have learned that people bring 
food 
during the weekend when there are fewer visitors there are 
fewer raccoons and they concentrate around the campsites that are 
being used hungerfor said 
some of the animals will be tagged with radio collars to see how 
far they roam and where they take shelter 
capture is not difficult using boxtype traps that do not hurt 
the raccoons theyre lured into the traps by smelly bait like 
sardines and mustard sauce 
a couple of these coons have decided they like being trapped 
you get food hungerford said

here are excerpts from the communique 
issued sunday after a joint meeting of iraqs ruling revolution 
command council and baath party the statement in arabic was 
translated into english by the associated press 
 
america is commiting deep criminal acts against iraq and the 
arab nation especially in occupying the arab and moslem holy places 
in najd and hejaz the former name for the territory that became 
saudi arabia and in its sanctions imposed against the iraqi 
people in a way that exceeds all humanitarian limits 
the united states thus has gone far below the minimum level of 
human standards toward which even those who believe in the law of 
the jungle would not stop 
america did all this to satisfy its arrogance and enforce its 
hegemony on the entire world 
america must not go too far and must get out of its mind the 
idea of pushing events into a military collision and it must 
realize the dangers of what it calls a lightning strike 
it should also abandon all this and remedy it as soon as 
possible by returning to the innermost parts of itself so as to 
search for remnants of wisdom to aid it so as to turn away from 
this dangerous approach as soon as possible primarily it should 
withdraw from the holy lands of the arabs and moslems 
america must realize clearly that it is pushing the entire 
region and not only iraq in fact even the whole world foremost 
of which its sons whom president bush brought to the region to 
the brink of a bottomless abyss from which the region will never 
see light for dozens of years 
the oil the areas it is in and israel will be transformed into 
something different from what they are now 
we will never allow anybody whomever he may be to strangle the 
people of iraq without having himself strangled if we feel that 
the iraqi people are being strangled that there are some who will 
deal a sanguinary blow to it we will strangle all those who are 
the cause of this 
the oil areas in saudi arabia and in other states of the region 
all the oil installations will be rendered incapable of responding 
to the needs of those who came to us as occupiers in order to usurp 
our sovereignty dignity and wealth 
israel will be included in all actions that affect the owners of 
the homeland in which the forces of evil and occupation have 
settled and in which nothing has maintained its purity except for 
the holy places and the generous people who reject this injustice 
and aggression 
those who wish the flood to overtake the iraqi people and the 
nation and are planning for this should remember well that the 
waves of the flood will overwhelm them before they overwhelm the 
iraqi people 
america and those who instigated it or collaborated with it 
should realize this well so as to reassess matters and to think 
again in the correct and precise manner upon which they should 
build the reckless odious and foolish behavior that has occurred 
so far should be enough for them 
everybody should also realize that what we have warned against 
might happen when the sparks come out of the barrels of confronting 
guns and out of the friction of the fleets of aggression with our 
means and forces 
the sparks might fly by mistake or deliberately to afterward 
cause a huge conflagration when this happens a flood will ensue 
to prevent the feared eventuality from taking place those 
concerned should pull back armies as well as navy and air fleets as 
soon as possible 
dire consequences will befall those who love to create wars 
problems and crises they will also befall evildoers and back 
stabbers 
as for the arabs who are launching good offices they are urged 
not to replace the solution that we offered on 12th august with a 
partial solution as turning the conflict from one concerning major 
issues into one regarding minor issues benefits the tactics of the 
enemies and their supporters 
the major issue concerns the struggle of the arabs and moslems 
in their righteous jihad holy war against falsehood the prime 
objective is the liberation of palestine from the usurpation of the 
zionist usurpers 
iraqs adherence to this position through an unequivocal 
declared policy has caused the evil arrows to be directed against 
it and caused the poisonous wasps to leave their holes to sting its 
sides and cause them to bleed in the most dangerous conspiracy that 
seeks to inflict political and economic harm on iraq to prepare for 
the military weakening of iraq and also for the weakening of its 
nationalist panarab and humanitarian role 
the conspiracy and those behind it have been exposed at the 
forefront of those charged with staging the conspiracy were the 
former rulers of kuwait who used kuwait which was separated from 
iraq as a base for a counterconspiracy they have massed its 
stolen resources to serve everything that would bring evil and 
disgrace to the national and islamic struggle 
the blow dealt to that evil ruling clique the agent of the 
foreigner was an indispensable defensive move to maintain iraqs 
features and resources and improve them in order to achieve the 
wellknown noble objectives 
thus usurped kuwait was restored to its people to be part of 
its original nation by an eternal decision from which there can be 
no retreat under any circumstances or conditions

the government warned sunday of a worldwide 
surge in antisemitic violence and said attitudes toward jews were 
slipping back to the spirit of the 19th century 
a 12page report reviewing antisemitism in 1990 cited murders 
and bombings among the incidents 
it said the soviet union and eastern europe were the focal 
points of attacks and threats against jews by ultra rightwing 
activists operating more freely since democratic reforms 
also blamed for growing antijewish sentiments were neonazis 
moslem fundamentalists and christian groups mostly in western 
europe 
social upheavals in some countries also have turned jews again 
into scapegoats the report said 
in latin america for example jews are increasingly targeted 
by terrorist groups especially leftist ones in their war against 
their governments it said 
antisemitism also is on the rise in the united states and 
canada the report said 
it said that desecrations of jewish cemeteries such as in 
carpentras france last may had reached epidemic proportions in 
many nations 
the conclusion without trying to create panic is a feeling 
that open antisemitism is growing with many countries sliding into 
tolerance a normalization that is in the spirit of the 19th 
century despite all the jewish people went through in the 20th 
century the report said 
cabinet secretary eliakim rubinstein who compiled the report 
suggested in an interview on israeli radio that more could be done 
by authorities in other nations to quell antisemitic acts 
there are two weapons to use one is by warning putting 
perpetrators on trial the second is through education like 
making the holocaust not only a marginal chapter in history 
classes rubinstein said 
an estimated 6 million jews died at the hands of the nazis 
during world war ii the holocaust was a catalyst for the founding 
of israel in 1948 
rubinsteins committee began studying antisemitism in 1988 
sundays report was its third and most severe 
it cited 18 antisemitic attacks on jews including bombings 
kidnappings and beatings so far this year 
three attacks were in western europe including britain two in 
the united states two in south africa one in new zealand and 10 
in latin america including several kidnappings murders and 
bombings the report said it gave no details 
in the soviet union the report claims ultranationalist groups 
have blamed jews for corruption and the downfall of communism 
much of the soviet antisemitism has surfaced in criticisms in 
prominent newspapers and threats of pogroms organized attacks used 
against jews in czarist russia the report said 
a report by the quasigovernment jewish agency predicted up to 2 
million soviet jews could emigrate to israel by 1995 swelling the 
nations present population of 45 million by 45 percent some of 
the immigration is prompted by an antisemitic atmosphere the 
agencys report said 
on the popular level you didnt see as much antisemitism 
before glasnost because there was more government control 
rubinstein said 
the report said soviet president mikhail gorbachev had failed to 
publicly condemn the antisemitism perhaps because of his 
attempts to maintain the support of various conservative 
elements

a pilot practicing takeoffs and landings 
says a stolen dc3 cargo plane later found with nearly 1 tons of 
cocaine aboard shadowed him with most of its lights off perhaps to 
hide from radar 
air traffic controllers at allentownbethlehemeaston 
international airport didnt know the plane was there until he 
radioed the pilot told the allentown morning call speaking on 
the condition he not be identified 
authorities confirmed his account airport director jack yohe 
said the planes passed within 300 to 500 feet of each other 
the dc3 approached the airport with most lights off late friday 
and made an unscheduled landing apparently because it had run low 
on fuel one man was arrested two escaped and 2968 pounds of 
cocaine were seized 
the small plane pilot speculated the cargo plane flew directly 
above him to make them appear as single blip on radar screens 
i was coming in for a landing and i was watching one airplane 
while i was waiting my turn to land and i looked up out of the 
airplane and there was another plane above me at an altitude of 
probably less than a thousand feet the pilot said in an 
interview published sunday 
the only lights the other plane had on were the red and 
green marker lights there was no strobe light there was no 
nothing that was all i saw the outline of the plane 
i called the radar guy at the control tower and i said 
do you have this guy on your scope and he said what plane 
alerted air traffic controllers notified airport security 
which met the plane when it taxied to a refueling station the men 
told the security guards they needed fuel and then fled on foot 
into a residential neighborhood 
police seized the plane and found 28 militarystyle duffel bags 
stuffed with 1349 kilograms of cocaine packed in 1kilo blocks a 
kilogram weighs about 22 pounds 
the colombian cocaine thought to have been destined for canada 
was valued at 130 million officials said the dc3 was reported 
stolen wednesday from the opalocke airport outside miami 
harold hill 46 of brantford ontario was caught and charged 
with possession of cocaine with intent to deliver and conspiracy 
he was arraigned saturday and was being held in lehigh county

the atonal music of arnold schoenberg may be as 
difficult to listen to as any composed in the 20th century 
the new york city opera charged into its challenges and saturday 
night gave the new york premiere of his twoact 1932 opera moses 
und aron which had its american premiere in boston in 1966 the 
opera will be heard five more times this season 
the production originally developed for the cologne opera in 
1978 is brilliantly done 
the music powerful but not attractive to the ear is propelled 
by rhythm because it doesnt follow a musical line its harder to 
listen to than bergs lulu or wozzeck 
nonetheless the orchestra conducted by christopher keene and 
singers sounded splendid they obviously had worked long and hard 
on the complex music the production is imaginitively lighted all 
scenes are viewed as though in a dusk that makes images fuzzy 
chorus men wore suits made like prison issue and women wore dresses 
resembling waitress uniforms all from shoes through face and 
hair the grim color of white clay spotlights on the floor 
sometimes created tall shadows on the back wall 
thomas young was aron this year he will also sing in john 
adams new opera the death of klinghoffer richard cross was a 
bearded whitehaired moses whose part is performed mainly in 
sprechstimme or speaking to music 
in the opera moses isnt a fluent speaker god has chosen his 
brother aron to be his spokesman 
the two are constantly in spiritual conflict moses has aron 
explain the unimaginable god to the israelites and they say hey 
need something visible aron makes moses staff become a snake the 
israelites decide god is strong if he has such mighty servants and 
theyll follow moses out of israel 
in act 2 the israelites are in the wilderness frustrated and 
about to riot because moses has been gone so long receiving the 10 
commandments aron says they can have their old gods back collects 
gold and exhibits a beautiful little golden calf on a pedestal lit 
by spotlights of changing colors in the longest scene there is 
dancing a ritual sacrifice to the calf and an orgy 
the opera ends soon after moses returns with tablets he raises 
his hand the golden calf falls and its pedestal disappears he and 
aron argue again aron saying the people need something concrete as 
well as an idea and moses lamenting his inability to explain the 
invisible god to them himself 
schoenberg who died in 1951 intended to write a third act but 
never did 
the program is the new york city opera debut for director hans 
neugebauer set and costume designer achim freyer and lighting 
designer hans toelstede for freyer its also his american debut

iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz accused 
the united states sunday of preventing him from attending the un 
general assembly debate on the gulf crisis and said his government 
will not participate 
in a letter to un secretary general javier perez de cuellar 
aziz said the state department on thursday had refused his 
governments request to permit an iraqi airways jetliner carrying 
aziz to land in new york 
the state department told the iraqi ambassador in washington 
that the ban on landing rights was in line with sanctions imposed 
after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait aziz was quoted as saying 
in an iraqi news agency report monitored in nicosia 
the state department proposed that the foreign minister and 
his entourage find alternative commercial means to fly them to new 
york aziz said 
i regret to inform you that the iraqi governments decision is 
not to participate in the deliberations of the un general 
assembly until the us government lifts all restrictions 
preventing the arrival of the iraqi delegation aboard an iraqi 
jetliner he said 
in washington a state department official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the matter actually is still under 
discussion but it would seem inappropriate to grant permission for 
the iraqi foreign minister to fly his plane to the united states 
while hundreds of americans citizens are being held against their 
will in iraq and kuwait 
the 160member general assembly convenes its 45th session 
monday the 15member security council is to meet tuesday in 
emergency session to discuss approving an air blockade to 
complement other sanctions to throttle iraqs economy and force it 
to relinquish kuwait 
the decision of the us administration in reality means 
prohibiting the iraqi foreign minister from participating in the 
deliberations of the general assembly to convey iraqs viewpoints 
on events in the gulf and conduct dialogue with un members on the 
issue aziz said 
this measure has special implications in these circumstances 
as the security council prepares at the instigation of the united 
states and its western allies to push through an air blockade of 
iraq

as nancy raddatz sees it a 
wheelchair is no excuse to keep from tap dancing nor should 
blindness throw a damper on a romantic pas de deux 
so the longtime dance teacher blew away 30 years of dust and 
spent over 80000 of her own money to convert a sheet metal firm 
into the uniquely abled dance center a groundfloor studio 
exclusively for the disabled 
the center which will offer free lessons took seven years to 
materialize and opened sunday about 70 students make up its first 
class 
its quite an undertaking said raddatz who has danced for 
51 of her 53 years and taught jazz tap ballet and ballroom 
dancing for 41 of them 
shes no newcomer to teaching the disabled with whom she says 
she can empathize after being stricken with polio as a child 
dozens of children and adults with vision hearing and mobility 
impairments have already learned the love of dancing through 
raddatzs commercial school 
you look at their disability but technically you look at 
their ability she said and thats what you work with 
her dream of creating a studio exclusively for the disabled 
began to take shape when her uncle moved his groundfloor sheet 
metal business out of the building that housed her original studio 
upstairs 
she bought the building which left her with a ground floor full 
of shelves dust and concrete but she needed thousands of dollars 
more to transform the space into a dance studio sponsors at first 
were hard to come by 
one group i wrote to said their funds only go to people who 
appreciate the arts she said as if when youre blind or 
deaf you cant appreciate such things 
the spark finally came in 1988 when nearby henry sibley high 
school raised 3000 
as word spread local businesses and service organizations began 
chipping in time and materials her students and their families 
formed an army of volunteers 
raddatz believes shes the first to open a free dance center 
exclusively for the disabled and she hopes the idea catches on 
if i start maybe this will be incentive for other people to 
do the same thing she said and if we make videotapes of the 
experience this could be something that just sort of spokes out 
and is made available in other areas 
dancing is a way of expressing yourself and its therapeutic 
when children and adults come in here its a happy experience so 
you do see them blossoming 
as a prime example she points to 11yearold jennifer jackson 
a downs syndrome child who has taken jazz and tap lessons at her 
original studio for three years 
its helped her tremendously in her coordination said 
jennifers mother joellyn the dance class also gives her 
something she can accomplish and be proud of

iraq on sunday unexpectedly apologized to 
france for the raid on the french ambassadors residence in kuwait 
that sparked a series of diplomatic expulsions and an escalation of 
tensions in the gulf crisis 
the official iraqi news agency quoted a foreign ministry 
spokesman as saying that an investigation showed the incident on 
sept 14 was a result of a mistake made by the iraqi soldiers on 
duty in kuwait city 
iraqi officials previously had denied any raid took place 
four frenchmen including the french military attache were 
captured by iraqi troops who forced their way into the ambassadors 
residence sept 14 
the spokesman said the iraqi foreign ministry had determined the 
soldiers who raided the house did not realize because the house 
was outside the diplomatic quarter that it was the former 
french ambassadors home 
iraq refers to envoys in kuwait as former diplomats saying they 
lost diplomatic immunity after failing to comply with orders to 
close their embassies in kuwait which iraq now claims as a 
province 
when the officer in charge of the soldiers learned about the 
mistake and found out that one of the persons who were in the house 
was a former diplomat the person received good treatment and 
was allowed to return to his site of employment the unidentified 
spokesman said in a report monitored in nicosia 
the other three people who were not diplomats were sent to 
the hyatt regency hotel and were later flown to baghdad where they 
reside at meliamansur hotel he said no measures were taken 
against them except they were prevented from travel 
earlier it had been believed the three frenchmen were moved to 
key installations where scores of foreigners are held hostage as 
human shields to avert an attack by usled forces massed in 
saudi arabia 
the foreign ministry apologizes for the previous statement in 
which the incident was described differently the spokesman was 
quoted as saying 
iraq has ordered all embassies in kuwait city to close about 15 
nations continue to defy the order and disregard iraqs annexation 
of kuwait iraqi authorities have cut off power water and 
telephone lines to those compounds 
belgian and canadian diplomatic quarters in kuwait were attacked 
the same day as the french raid the iraqi spokesman made no 
mention of these incidents 
french president francois mitterrand retaliated harshly 
ordering 4000 troops to saudi arabia and expelling dozens of 
iraqis from france 
frances european community partners expelled iraqi military 
attaches last week 
baghdad responded by expelling european us egyptian and 
saudi military attaches and their aides

nikita khrushchev in memoirs dictated in the 
late 1960s but just now released called fidel castro hotheaded for 
advocating a nuclear strike against the united states during the 
cuban missile crisis 
khrushchev who was ousted from power in the soviet union in 
1964 and who died in 1971 also thanked julius and ethel rosenberg 
for helping the soviet union develop the atomic bomb 
khrushchev made a series of tapes as he lived out his last seven 
years under virtual house arrest in the village of petrovodalneye 
on the outskirts of moscow many of the tapes were smuggled to the 
west and two volumes of memoirs khrushchev remembers and 
khrushchev remembers the last testament were published in the 
1970s 
but khrushchevs friends and relatives withheld some of the 
tapes fearing that he had been too candid last year time 
magazine acquired the tapes excerpts were published in the oct 1 
issue and another book khrushchev remembers the glasnost 
tapes is due out in october from little brown 
in the memoirs khrushchev said josef stalin was grateful to the 
rosenbergs who were executed in 1953 after being convicted of 
conspiracy to commit espionage by spying on american atom bomb 
secrets for the soviet union 
khrushchev said i was part of stalins circle when he 
mentioned the rosenbergs with warmth i cannot specifically say 
what kind of help they gave us but i heard from both stalin and 
vyacheslav molotov then minister of foreign affairs that the 
rosenbergs provided very significant help in accelerating the 
production of our atom bomb 
let this be a worthy tribute to the memory of those people 
let my words serve as an expression of gratitude to those who 
sacrificed their lives to a great cause of the soviet state at a 
time when the us was using its advantage over us to blackmail our 
state and undermine our proletarian cause he added 
on the cuban missile crisis khrushchev said the soviets decided 
to place missiles in cuba to deter the united states from an 
invasion 
khrushchev said president kennedy understood that in spite of 
the american advantages the missiles we had already installed 
could strike new york city washington and other centers 
then khrushchev recalled intelligence reports indicated that 
the united states was preparing to strike cuba and that an invasion 
was unavoidable 
castro suggested that to prevent our nuclear missiles from 
being destroyed we should launch a preemptive strike against the 
us he said my comrades in the leadership and i realized 
that our friend fidel totally failed to understand our purpose we 
had installed the missiles not for the purpose of attacking the 
us but to keep the us from attacking cuba 
khrushchev said kennedy then sent a message somewhere between 
threat and prayer he both demanded and begged that we remove the 
missiles we agreed to remove the rockets and warheads if the 
president would publicly give assurance in his own name and that 
of his allies that their armed forces would not invade cuba 
kennedy did 
castro was hotheaded he thought we were retreating worse 
capitulating he did not understand that our action was necessary 
to prevent a military confrontation we believed this came from 
his being young and inexperienced as a statesman khrushchev 
said 
later when i met castro in the soviet union i told him you 
wanted to start a war with the united states if the war had 
started we would somehow have survived but cuba no doubt would 
have ceased to exist 
he added fidel was embarrassed he had failed to think 
through the obvious consequences of a proposal that placed the 
planet on the brink of extinction

president turgut ozal on sunday flew to 
the united states where he is expected to press president bush for 
economic and military aid to offset turkeys losses from the 
economic embargo of iraq 
turkeys losses over a year could be as high as 7 billion 
turkish officials say 
ozal will meet bush at the white house on tuesday he also will 
confer with defense secretary dick cheney and will receive a 
briefing from gen colin powell chairman of the us joint chiefs 
of staff ozal later was to address a un summit meeting on 
children 
turkey is playing a key role in the unsponsored embargo 
imposed after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 it has shut off two 
pipelines carrying iraqi crude to a terminal on its mediterranean 
coast and ceased its previously large volume of trade with iraq 
the united states apparently has not requested a military role 
by turkey but the turkish army with 800000 men under arms the 
largest in nato besides that of the united states would likely be 
involved if war broke out 
turkish forces in the southeast numbering about 100000 are 
tying up eight iraqi divisions according to turkeys defense 
minister safa giray 
turkey also has beefed up its air force in the south shifting 
aircraft from other parts of the country the united states has 
deployed 14 f111 fighterbombers and 24 f16s at natos incirlik 
airbase near the southern city of adana 
along with requests to help modernize the turkish armed forces 
ozal will ask bush to use his influence to help turkey obtain soft 
loans from the oilrich gulf states japan the european economic 
community and international lending agencies according to 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
to date the only help has been a 300 million grant from the 
exiled kuwaiti government 
he also will press the united states to lift restrictions on 
turkeys most competitive export item textiles and readywear 
clothing officials said

early on in david h souters confirmation 
hearings the question on most minds switched from whether he would 
be the supreme courts newest justice to what kind of justice he 
would be 
senate approval quickly seemed inevitable it may come within a 
week but still unanswered is where a justice souter fits in on a 
court closely divided on key issues 
the ambiguity surrounding souter in a way mirrors that 
surrounding the president who nominated him 
souters 12year record as a new hampshire judge was one of a 
closetothevest conservative but his testimony before the senate 
judiciary committee at times startled conservatives because it 
suggested an expansive view of some constitutional provisions 
george bush campaigned for office as a man dedicated to 
appointing supreme court members who like reagan appointee antonin 
scalia would work to overturn the 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion 
but souter has virtually no track record on abortion and the 
president said he did not ask for assurances a disappointment to 
some abortion foes who support bush 
abortion rights advocates still suspect the worst 
but it must be remembered that one of bushs closest friend had 
been potter stewart the late supreme court justice who abhorred 
ideological agendas 
souter told his senate interrogators he is not an adherent of 
searching out the original intent of the constitutions 
authors but instead believes the court can find new 
interpretations of the documents original meaning 
thats how souter explained his support of a 1954 court ruling 
that the 14th amendment outlawed racially segregated public 
schools even though the united states was a segregated society 
when the amendment was ratified 
asked to condemn activist judges souter joked that such a 
label usually is attached to anyone who renders unpopular 
decisions he passed up an invitation to criticize any decision of 
the liberal supreme court of the 1960s 
souter endorsed the supreme courts oneperson onevote ruling 
that limited states power to redraw district lines for legislative 
elections and praised effusively william j brennan the retired 
liberal justice he was named to succeed 
is souter billed as a conservative really a moderate probably 
not 
the greater likelihood is souter is what sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio called anthony m kennedy during that justices 
confirmation hearings three years ago a traditional 
conservative 
kennedy has joined conservative chief justice william h 
rehnquist in 90 percent of the courts decisions since being 
confirmed unanimously by the senate his votes gave rehnquist a 
working conservative majority similar to the liberal majority 
delivered to chief justice earl warren in 1962 when arthur goldberg 
was named a justice 
souters presence could give rehnquist a sixth vote in a 
significant number of cases but no one can predict with absolute 
certainty which cases 
once on the court how would david h souter vote in cases 
presenting such contentious issues as abortion affirmative action 
freedom of speech and churchstate relations the nominee swore 
under oath he wont know until those cases present themselves 
 
eds richard carelli has been covering the supreme court for the 
associated press since 1976

a major us aid package could be 
withheld until pakistan proves it does not possess a nuclear bomb 
news reports said sunday 
a foreign ministry spokesman said us ambassador robert oakley 
mentioned the nuclear program during discussions with senior 
pakistani officials last week but disputed reports oakley warned 
the 573 million in military and economic aid could be stalled 
mr oakley mentioned the nuclear program and what effects it 
could have on certification of aid said the spokesman who 
cannot be identified under briefing rules but the impression 
given in newspaper reports that aid could be withheld or that the 
us administration may not provide the certificate is very 
negative 
since 1988 the united states has required pakistan prove it 
does not have a nuclear weapon before aid is authorized before 
then pakistan was exempt from a us law prohibiting aid to 
countries that have not signed the nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty 
pakistan has refused to cooperate with international inspection 
procedures under the treaty until india signs the pact the two 
nations have had a series of border conflicts 
pakistans major newspapers reported that oakley warned senior 
pakistani officials that president bush wont seek authorization of 
the aid package until us officials verify pakistans nuclear 
capability 
pakistan which receives its largest source of economic aid from 
the united states repeatedly denies any access to a nuclear 
weapon although it is widely believed that both pakistan and india 
are capable of building one 
india exploded a nuclear device in the mid1970s 
tensions between the two countries increased earlier this year 
when india again cracked down on a moslem secessionist movement in 
its jammukashmir state where more than 1180 people have died in 
fighting between militants and indian security forces 
jammukashmir is part of disputed territory partitioned in 1947 
after the end of british colonial rule 
pakistan wants kashmiris on both sides of the border to vote on 
union either with pakistan or india

the federal government spent more than 215 
billion last year on welfare programs for families started by 
teenagers according to a report released sunday 
the amount is 17 billion higher than for 1988 partly because 
of inflation and expansion of medicaid benefits but also due to an 
increase in births to teenagers said to the center for population 
options report 
the figures illustrate the need for greater efforts to prevent 
teenage pregnancies including sex education family planning 
counseling support for delaying sexual activity access to 
contraception and medical services including abortion said the 
report by the privately funded organization that concentrates on 
world wide population issues 
we can no longer let our youth stumble into parenting a 
course that should be embarked on only when one is ready willing 
and able to become a parent the report said 
the costs of teenage pregnancies go far beyond those of public 
support the report said 
tooearly childbearing often impoverishes the lives of 
girls brought too soon into the rigors and responsibilities of 
motherhood of boys bewildered and unable to parent and provide 
adequately of babies not planned or welcomed the report said 
it places a heavy burden on families and communities and 
contributes to our countrys unconscionably high rates of low 
birthweight and neonatal mortality it said 
the most alarming increases in teenage pregnancies are 
occurring among 15 to 17 year olds the report said 
after a downward trend in births among this age group from 1970 
into the mid 1980s the rate began increasing it jumped from 306 
per 1000 teenagers in 1986 to 338 in 1988 according to the 
national center for health statistics 
teenage pregnancies too often result in the mother cutting 
short her education which increases her chance of living in 
poverty and needing public assistance the report said 
in estimating federal spending on families started by 
teenagers the center included families currently headed by 
teenage mothers as well as those in which the mother is now 20 
years or older but had her first child when she was a teenager 
the cost includes the federal governments share for aid for 
families with dependent children medicaid and food stamps received 
by these families 
the center also calculated the public cost for five states and 
two cities for 1989 adding in the welfare expenditures of the 
states cities and towns 
these were louisiana 360 million new mexico 80 million 
oregon 174 million vermont 39 million wisconsin 437 
million baltimore 246 million and st louis 81 million

a special court on sunday ordered ousted 
prime minister benazir bhutto to stand trial next month on charges 
of corruption and misconduct during her 20 months in power 
justice rashid aziz khan issued the notice to bhutto saying the 
armybacked caretaker government had sufficient evidence to support 
its claim he ordered the civil proceedings to start oct 2 
if convicted ms bhutto could be disqualified from the oct 24 
election and barred from politics for up to seven years 
ms bhutto would have the right to appeal to the lahore high 
court and then to the supreme court a process that most likely 
would not be completed before next months ballot 
ms bhutto 37 won election in november 1988 and took office a 
month later as the first woman to lead a modern moslem nation she 
now is a candidate for five seats in the 217member national 
assembly the lawmaking lower house of parliament 
her aides say ms bhutto ran for more than one post in case she 
is disqualified from one seat 
after learning of the judges decision ms bhutto canceled 
appointments and met behind the fortresslike walls of her seaside 
home in karachi about 600 miles southwest of lehore her aides 
refused comment 
ms bhutto previously has called the charges a political 
vendetta and said she would not appear before the special 
onejudge tribunals 
the tribunals were originally set up following the 1977 military 
coup that toppled her father the late prime minister zulfikar ali 
bhutto and resurrected last month by the caretaker government made 
up largely of her opponents and former allies 
if she refuses to appear legal experts say ms bhutto could be 
tried in absentia and held in contempt of court possibly facing a 
fine or arrest 
president ghulam ishaq khan using his constitutional powers 
dismissed ms bhuttos government aug 6 on charges of corruption 
nepotism political incompetence and abuse of power he alleged 
that ms bhuttos government used tens of millions of dollars in 
special funds to buy votes and private business deals charges that 
the former prime minister and her government have denied 
four corruption charges two in lahore and two in karachi 
have been filed against ms bhutto before special tribunals only 
one charge has been accepted hearings are scheduled later this 
week on the others 
the charge accepted by aziz khan alleges ms bhutto misused her 
power by illegally approving the sale of 287 acres of federal land 
to a londonbased company operated by a cousin the land allegedly 
sold at drastically reduced prices was to be used for a luxury 
hotel and resort outside the capital islamabad 
after reviewing the evidence the judge issued a notice ordering 
ms bhutto or her attorney to appear and show why she should not be 
found guilty of misconduct 
shortly after replacing ms bhutto the caretaker government 
began what it called a process of accountability to investigate 
allegations of corruption not only against her former 
administration but against many of her political opponents 
the caretaker government has spent much of the past month trying 
to portray ms bhuttos administration as the most corrupt in 
pakistans 43year history despite allegations the caretaker 
government has yet to make public any proof 
most pakistanis believe the scheme has backfired and evoked 
memories of the same process that ms bhuttos father endured 
before he was hanged by the military government in 1979 
western diplomats have hinted that economic and military aid 
worth hundreds of millions of dollars could be jeopardized if ms 
bhutto is victimized 
most analysts say ms bhutto and her pakistan peoples party 
appear to be gaining strength and could emerge from next months 
election as the single largest party

incursion which sparked a wave of retaliatory expulsions and 
increased tensions between iraq and european nations 
iraq also said it would not attend the un general assembly 
session that opens monday because its delegation was not being 
allowed to travel to new york on iraqi airways the airline has no 
landing rights because of the un trade embargo

fathers flew home on the last uschartered flight from baghdad 
in washington top finance officials from the worlds wealthiest 
nations met for a second day seeking to forge a united front 
against threats to the global economy stemming from the gulf 
crisis they met with mixed success 
in warning other nations not to try to force it to give up 
kuwait iraq said we will never allow anybody whomever he may 
be to strangle the people of iraq without having himself 
strangled 
the oil areas in saudi arabia and in other states of the 
region all the oil installations will be rendered incapable 
and israel will be transformed into something different from what 
they are now said an iraqi government statement broadcast by 
staterun radio baghdad and monitored in nicosia cyprus 
america must realize clearly that it is pushing the entire 
region in fact even the whole world to the brink of a 
bottomless abyss from which the region will never see light for 
dozens of years said the statement translated from arabic by 
the associated press 
iraqs decision to stay away from the general assembly session 
was reported by the official iraqi news agency it said foreign 
minister tariq aziz told un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar that iraqs delegation would not come to new york unless 
restrictions on iraqi airways its flag carrier were lifted 
a state department official said the matter was still under 
consideration 
in any event iraq was hardly likely to get a warm welcome at 
the united nations the security council was to meet tuesday and 
consider tightening the trade embargo against baghdad with an air 
blockade baghdad also was expected to come in for widespread 
condemnation in general assembly debate 
among the first scheduled to speak was french president francois 
mitterrand who dispatched troops to the gulf after iraqi soldiers 
violated french and other diplomatic compounds in kuwait earlier 
this month 
the iraqi foreign ministry sunday apologized for the sept 14 
raid it said its soldiers had not realized they were entering the 
french ambassadors residence because the house was outside the 
diplomatic quarter of kuwait city

which the incident was described differently an unidentified 
ministry spokesman was quoted as saying iraq previously had denied 
the raid took place 
the first units of a french rapid deployment force arrived in 
the gulf region sunday joining tens of thousands of us troops 
deployed in the saudi arabian desert 
secretary of state james a baker iii said that despite the huge 
deployment the united states was still seeking nonmilitary means 
of forcing iraq out of kuwait 
baker interviewed sunday on nbctvs meet the press was 
asked about the possibility of war we have said many times we 
hoped there wont be he replied but added that president bush 
was not ruling out any options 
meanwhile a charter flight carrying 112 evacuees from iraq and 
kuwait landed in raleigh nc sunday from london the passengers 
had left baghdad a day earlier aboard what the state department 
said was the last uschartered airlift planned from iraq 
at the london stopover the exhausted evacuees told of hardship 
and terror in kuwait and iraq western women and children have been 
allowed to leave but the baghdad government has kept foreign men 
captive to serve as human shields at strategic sites 
jacqui jones a scot said she was forced to leave her 
terminally ill husband behind i didnt know i had so many 
tears she told reporters 
twentyeight of the 140 passengers on saturdays flight remained 
in london sunday was the second day of talks in washington among 
wealthy industrialized nations held as part of the annual meetings 
of the international monetary fund and the world bank 
repercussions of the gulf crisis took center stage 
the united states is leading a bid to channel billions of 
dollars to the socalled frontline states of turkey egypt and 
jordan and other countries whose economies have been hit by the 
trade embargo against iraq and the steep rise in oil prices 
although broad outlines of the plan were agreed upon british 
chancellor of the exchequer john major told reporters that specific 
amounts of assistance and which countries should be helped had not 
yet been worked out 
in other gulfrelated developments sunday 
two radical iranian newspapers criticized an effort by syrian 
president hafez assad to persuade iran not to violate the trade 
embargo against iraq assad irans key arab ally and an archrival 
of iraqs saddam hussein met behind closed doors with president 
hashemi rafsanjani saturday 
the syrian leader who held talks with baker earlier this month 
is seen as having some leverage with tehran because of syrias 
support for iran during its eightyear war with iraq 
iran has criticized iraqs invasion of kuwait but it has also 
deplored the deployment of foreign forces in the region and hinted 
it might circumvent the embargo for humanitarian reasons 
president turgut ozal of turkey flew to the united states for 
talks with president bush and other officials on the gulf crisis 
he is expected to press for economic and military aid to offset 
turkeys heavy losses from the embargo 
although the gulf crisis showed no signs of cooling off 
temperatures in the saudi desert were abating slightly the highs 
in recent days have ranged in the mid90s compared to routine 
readings of up to 120 degrees in august when the us deployment 
began

the swiss in a referendum held against 
the backdrop of the gulf crisis and rising oil prices voted sunday 
against a proposal to close the countrys five nuclear power 
plants 
while narrowly rejecting the socialistbacked plan to 
decommission the plants over the next 30 to 40 years voters 
approved a related constitutional amendment to bar the construction 
of new plants for the next 10 years 
the official results showed 529 percent of the voters opposed 
the total shutdown while 546 percent approved the draft amendment 
barring licensing of new reactors until the year 2000 
seventyone percent approved a third proposal that gives the 
federal government greater power to enact energy saving measures 
the socialist party hailed the vote as a turning point in 
the countrys energy policy it blamed the narrow rejection of the 
shutdown proposal on an expensive publicity campaign by the utility 
industry 
the conservative government which had opposed both measures 
also said it was satisfied with the results it said they showed 
the swiss werent ready to renounce nuclear power yet 
about 40 percent of the eligible voters turned out 
the tenyear moratorium codified the status quo local 
opposition to two major projects has effectively stopped them the 
last nuclear plant went on line in 1984 
protests since 1975 in the basel region frustrated construction 
of a plant at kaiseraugst on the rhine last month another group 
of companies announced it was halting a project at graben near 
bern and planned to sue the federal government to recover 230 
million 
the five operating plants provide 40 percent of switzerlands 
electrical power hydroelectric dams provide the rest 
environmental activists noting that switzerland is a net 
exporter of electricity say increased energy efficiency and 
alternative energies would permit a nuclear shutdown 
in opposing the measures transport and energy minister adolf 
ogi said the persian gulf crisis showed the dangers posed by 
dependency on energy imports 
it was the third time since 1979 that antinuclear groups had 
forced a referendum on atomic power under the swiss system of 
direct democracy any proposal backed by more than 10000 
signatures must be put to a vote 
the move seeking a nuclear shutdown was launched shortly after 
the 1986 chernobyl disaster the government says strict safety 
measures rule out a similar accident at swiss plants

iran bought at least 14 advanced soviet 
fighter jets in a deal signed by president hashemi rafsanjani in 
moscow last june iranian sources said sunday 
one of the mig29 supersonic jets was shown on iranian 
television sunday one source in tehran said the planes were part 
of a 6 billion package rafsanjani signed with the soviets that is 
said to include tanks and other heavy weaponry 
the deal emphasizes the degree to which the soviet union has 
shifted away from iraq its longtime ally in the gulf region 
the acquisition of the supersonic fighters is a big boost for 
irans badly depleted air force iraq irans foe in the 198088 
war has 30 of the advanced mig29s 
the kremlin has never sold the migs to any government except 
those whose ties with moscow were more than excellent the tehran 
times which is close to rafsanjani noted in an editorial as 
such the soviets agreement to sell iran the advanced fighters has 
a great deal of significance for regional political circles 
irans military purchases will not be limited to this newly 
acquired batch of fighters moscow has announced its agreement to 
sell more arms to the islamic republic the newspaper said 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said in a 
telephone interview that tehran bought the fighters on condition 
they were delivered fully equipped with sophisticated 
electronics not made available to other soviet clients such as 
iraq 
the fighters were fitted with lookdownshootdown radar which 
provides allweather operating capability against lowflying 
targets the source said 
the mig29s which the soviets have been using since 1985 and 
which are comparable to the usmade f16 also came equipped with 
infrared searchandtrack sensors the source said 
irans statetun television network monitored in nicosia 
saturday showed a mig29 fighter with iranian air force markings 
wheeled out of a hangar for takeoff 
the source said iranian pilots were sent to the soviet union for 
mig29 training soon after rafsanjani signed the deal in moscow 
iran has been rebuilding its armed forces since the august 1988 
ceasefire in the gulf war mansour sattari irans air force 
commander said in june that iran would equip its air force with 
the worlds most sophisticated military weapons 
the iranian air force a powerful force supplied with 
sophisticated usmade jets under the late shah quickly fell 
apart during the gulf war for lack of spare parts it now consists 
of fewer than 50 planes some without radar 
the tehran times said other european countries have informed 
tehran of their preparedness to meet irans military needs and it 
is said that iran is considering these offers as well 
china has offered weapons at good prices but tehran seems 
to opt for sophisticated and advanced weaponry for its air force 
in particular it said 
western military sources say iran spends 6 billion a year on 
defense

a diabetic woman was the first to eave the airplane in north 
carolina walking slowly with a small us flag clutched in one 
hand 
she was in pain but she insisted on walking off you could see 
she had a lot of pride myers said these people seemed very 
relieved to be here you could see it on their faces the first 
thing i saw was a small child waving an american flag 
the evacuees included 76 adults 20 children over age 2 and 15 
infants myers said among the refugees were 41 americans 43 
jordanians seven palestinians four iraqis and two kuwaitis 
twenty passengers planned to fly on to california and 11 each to 
texas and michigan myers said 
like other freedom flights the refugees traveled overland from 
kuwait to baghdad where they boarded a chartered jet 
iraqi president saddam hussein has allowed some women and 
children to leave but he has kept foreign men behind to serve as 
human shields at strategic sites 
about 2500 americans have fled iraq and kuwait since the aug 2 
iraqi invasion evacuation flights have brought about 2000 people 
mostly women and children back to the united states others 
fled by overland desert routes

really trashy out there at the moment

britons trapped by the iraqi invasion said that this flight was 
different from the others people were less distressed but more 
desperate 
i think a lot of them didnt want to come out but came because 
there was nothing else to do it seems food and water is becoming a 
problem for people still in kuwait the soldiers are doing a lot of 
systematic rounding up now and there is a fair amount of shooting 
going on she said

terminallyill husband in iraq called on the government to act to 
get sick britons out of iraq

arab reports said 
this is a murder that cannot be ignored or regarded as 
statistics said the rightwing agriculture minister rafael 
eitan 
the punishment they deserve is that today tonight we 
need to go in there grab 200 local youths and deport them to 
lebanon he said in an interview 
no stone should be left standing around the gutted car the 
residents should be prevented from going to work or traveling on 
the roads until they decide if they want war or not if they do 
they will get it said eitan a former army chief of staff 
health minister ehud olmert said on israel radio and television 
that any civilian or soldier surrounded by palestinians must feel 
he can use his gun and kill those who want to kill him plain and 
simple 
the comments reflected the shock felt in israel over the 
killing which came at a time when many believed the 34monthold 
palestinian uprising in the occupied lands was waning 
the palestine liberation organization on sunday called for the 
escalation of the uprising in the west bank and gaza strip to 
confront a new israeli plan to step up the use of fire and gas 
bombs 
bassam abu sharif one of plo chairman yasser arafats senior 
advisers said israeli repression had increased and palestinians 
had the to resist the israeli occupation forces with all means as 
described by the un charter 
in his telex from plo headquarters in tunis tunisia abu sharif 
did not say what intensified resistance would entail 
a senior israeli military official who briefed reporters on 
condition of anonymity indicated soldiers would destroy the homes 
of suspects in the attack on pomeranz several dozen suspects had 
been detained he said 
the radio said 100 palestinians in the camp believed their homes 
were slated for wrecking the army has often destroyed arab homes 
as punishment for killing israelis 
israeli military officials have said pomeranz mistakenly drove 
into the el bureij refugee camp and palestinians stoned his 
vehicle his car collided with a donkey cart injuring two youths 
on the cart the palestinians continued to stone the vehicle and 
then set it on fire the officials said 
pomeranz was the 48th israeli to die in the intefadeh or 
uprising which began in december 1987 
israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 730 palestinians and 
264 have been killed by fellow arabs as suspected collaborators

pomeranzs slaying by defense minister moshe arens and the military 
chief of staff lt gen dan shomron it announced no decisions 
parliament which is in recess until october is to hold a 
special session wednesday to debate the killing 
defense ministry spokesman dan naveh said the attack was 
unprecedented in that everyone present took part and no one tried 
to protect the soldier 
efraim sneh a former senior occupation official was among 
those counseling against sweeping retaliation 
sneh said authorities should concentrate on finding and 
punishing those directly responsible and warned that harsh 
sweeping measures would play into the hands of israels enemies 
instead of saddam hussein being the center of attention we 
will allow the hostile forces to focus the attention on us sneh 
told israel army radio 
many hardliners supported eitans call for collective 
punishment others called for imposing the death penalty and giving 
soldiers greater freedom to open fire
