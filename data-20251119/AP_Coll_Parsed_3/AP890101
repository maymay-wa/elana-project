the celluloid torch has been passed to a new 
generation filmmakers who grew up in the 1960s 
platoon running on empty 1969 and mississippi 
burning are among the movies released in the past two years from 
writers and directors who brought their own experiences of that 
turbulent decade to the screen 
the contemporaries of the 60s are some of the filmmakers of 
the 80s its natural said robert friedman the senior vice 
president of worldwide advertising and publicity at warner bros 
chris gerolmo who wrote the screenplay for mississippi 
burning noted that the sheer passage of time has allowed him and 
others to express their feelings about the decade 
distance is important he said i believe theres a lot of 
thinking about that time and america in general 
the vietnam war was a defining experience for many people in the 
60s shattering the consensus that the united states had a right 
even a moral duty to intervene in conflicts around the world even 
today politicians talk disparagingly of the vietnam syndrome in 
referring to the countrys reluctance to use military force to 
settle disputes 
i think future historians will talk about vietnam as one of the 
near destructions of american society said urie brofenbrenner a 
professor of sociology at cornell university 
in world war ii we knew what we were fighting for but not in 
vietnam 
full metal jacket gardens of stone platoon good 
morning vietnam hamburger hill and bat 21 all use the 
war as a dramatic backdrop and show how it shaped characters lives 
the vietnam war has remained an emotional issue in the united 
states as veterans have struggled to come to terms with their 
experiences one was oliver stone who wrote and directed the 
academy awardwinning platoon 
i saw platoon eight times said john j anderson a palm 
beach county sheriffs lieutenant who served in vietnam in 196667 
i cried the first time i saw it and the third and fourth 
times platoon helped me understand 
stone who based platoon on some of his own experiences as a 
grunt said the film brought up issues that had yet to be resolved 
people are responding to the fact that its real theyre 
curious about the war in vietnam after 20 years he said 
while southeast asia was the pivotal foreign issue in american 
society of the 60s civil rights was the major domestic issue the 
civil rights movement reached its peak in the freedom summer of 
1964 when large groups of volunteers headed south to help register 
black voters 
in five corners a movie about the summer of 64 in the bronx 
starring jodie foster her friend played by tim robbins leaves his 
neighborhood to volunteer in the south after seeing the rev martin 
luther king jr on television 
alan parkers mississippi burning focuses on an incident that 
clouded the mississippi summer project when 1000 young volunteers 
from mainstream america swept into the state to help register black 
voters the movie is a fictionalized account of the disappearance 
and slaying of three civil rights workers michael schwerner andrew 
goodman and james chaney 
they were reported missing on june 21 several hours after being 
stopped for speeding near philadelphia miss after a nationally 
publicized search their bodies were discovered aug 4 on a farm 
just outside the town 
one of those who recalled the incident was gerolmo a student in 
the new york public school system at the time the screenwriter said 
the incident had a powerful effect on his way of thinking 
it was the first time i ever considered that our country could 
be wrong gerolmo said 
the film stars willem dafoe and gene hackman star as fbi agents 
who try to find the bodies of the missing workers and overcome 
fierce local resistance to solve the crime 
in a more offbeat and outrageous way john waters hairspray 
discusses integration in baltimore in 1963 when a group of 
teenagers tries to break down the barriers of a segregated dance 
show 
also set in baltimore is barry levinsons tin men starring 
danny devito and richard dreyfuss as two slick aluminum siding 
salesmen in the early 60s the movie mirrored a squarely 
middleclass culture one that was not caught up in sex politics 
and drugs 
instead of focusing on a wellknown historic event 
writerdirector ernest thompson takes a more personal approach in 
1969 robert downey jr and keifer sutherland star as college 
students who battle their parents and each other over sex drugs and 
the vietnam war 
i was 19 in 1969 it was a fulcrum time for me said 
thompson who was a student at american university at the time i 
think it was just the right time in my growth as an artist and as a 
man to try to write about something that happened in my youth 
running on empty takes place in the 80s but the 60s are 
much in evidence judd hirsch and christine lahti play antiwar 
activists who sabatoged a napalm plant in 1970 and are forced to 
live underground with their two children 
naomi foner who wrote running on empty and also served as 
the films executive producer grew up in brooklyn ny the 
daughter of sociologists her own experiences made foner well 
qualified to give running on empty its strong political theme 
i lived through that time and ive wanted to find the right way 
to present it to this generation said foner a member of the 
radical students for a democratic society while attending graduate 
school at columbia university 
foner who also taught in harlems head start program and helped 
register voters in south carolina said many young people are 
curious about what happened in the 60s 
a lot of them think it was an exciting time that they were 
sorry to have missed she said 
brofenbrenner said movies are a good indicator of the concerns of 
the general public the principle impact of the media is that they 
reflect the values of the larger society 
film is a very powerful art medium he said i believe it 
very accurately reflects not only the prevailing but the coming 
trends its because film writers like other writers are 
perceptive people they get the message of whats going on

for students working in a miniature factory at 
the university of missourirolla the future of american business is 
now 
when our students go into industry they will have 
stateoftheart knowledge that will affect decisions about 
expanding the role of robots and automated machines in the 
workplace said sema alptekin designer of the futuristic business 
laboratory 
ms alptekin is a mechanical and industrial engineer who directs 
the universitys computerintegrated manufacturing and packaging 
laboratory 
the lab established two years ago at a cost of 120000 is the 
only project of its kind in the state and one of the more advanced 
such programs in the country 
tom akas of the society of manufacturing engineers said ms 
alptekin has created a model for similar laboratories students 
can see how the factory of the future operates 
the society of manufacturing engineers has recognized ms 
alptekin as an outstanding young manufacturing engineer 
in her lab a conveyer belt at waist level carries parts from 
storage shelves to a robot that dominates the room like a silent 
4foot metal sentry the robot is a vshaped jointed arm on a 
pivoting base the arm can be fitted to allow it to grasp lift and 
turn objects of differing sizes to suit a variety of tasks the 
robot then swivels to place parts in position at the automated lathe 
or milling machine 
the entire factory would fit inside a basketball halfcourt the 
machinery is of the type used to make small parts in metal cutting 
shops ms alptekin said 
students learn to program a computer and automated machines 
linked to it in a complete manufacturing operation retrieving raw 
materials from the storage shelf unit which can be programmed to 
supply appropriate parts from its inventory lifting and placing the 
parts in position with the robots arm and shaping parts into 
finished products at the lathe 
students using the lab have designed and produced engraved key 
chains and intricate mazes and puzzles out of plastic and plexiglass 
but the product is less important than the process ms alptekin 
said former students have entered fields as disparate as aviation 
and financial consulting 
in the factory of the future according to the universitys 
model human chatter will be replaced by the clickclack of machines 
ours is quite unique its totally integrated ms alptekin 
said referring to programming that allows components such as the 
automated storage system to talk to the computer that controls 
the manufacturing process informing it about the availability of 
parts 
ms alptekin said it is this aspect that sets the lab apart even 
from industries where robots and automated machines have become 
almost commonplace there she said robots perform specific tasks 
in islands of automation but human workers remain responsible 
for keeping inventory and coordinating different aspects of the 
production line 
ms alptekin said automation is widespread in the automobile 
industry but she would like to see it expanded 
it should be used in any industry she said its difficult 
to justify economically but if quality is the concern then it can 
be easily justified 
at least our students will be aware of the enhancements and 
developments in this area and when they make decisions as engineers 
and managers they will take this into consideration she said 
a masters candidate analyzed the existing system with an eye to 
altering it to create a new product ms alptekin said the student 
identified what new production components were necessary and 
determined how they could be integrated into the system 
a doctoral candidate is developing computer software that will 
allow the system to diagnose itself the system could be programmed 
to recognize when a component is not working and then decide to 
switch to manufacturing a product that does not involve the disabled 
component much as human managers would react 
graduate student bob borchelt said the equipment he is using is 
on the cutting edge of manufacturing 
truthfully i cant say that i was expecting this level of 
expertise he said i know that our lab is one of the best of 
its kind in an educational institution 
the lab like the entire engineering management program calls on 
computing mechanical electrical and chemical skills and teamwork 
for us for managers the entire system is important ms 
alptekin said 
ms alptekin said she is continually finetuning the lab this 
past year the original robot was replaced with one able to perform 
more tasks she now is considering purchasing a robot with vision 
sophisticated enough to act as an inspector 
the university spent 30000 to upgrade lab equipment in 1987 an 
estimated 60000 to 70000 was earmarked in 1988 
international business machines corp recently pledged 12 
million in computer equipment and software to the university as part 
of an ibm program to aid 48 collegebased robotics labs across the 
country 
studies show that theres a severe national shortage of 
instructional materials in this growing and critical area said 
andy russell a spokesman for ibm ibm will benefit because we 
will be helping to train the computerintegrated manufacturing 
workers and decision makers of today and tomorrow

in the nations capital where the federal 
governments war on drugs is mapped out young washingtonians 
fighting over drugs were killing each other at a rate of more than 
one a day during 1988 
the district of columbias drug problems dramatize the two 
different washingtons the capitol the white house and other sites 
visited by millions of tourists each year and the squalid 
neighborhoods tucked away from the traditional seats of power 
there a more vicious power struggle is contested among teens drawn 
to the status and money that come from selling drugs 
in 1988 371 persons had been killed in the nations capital as 
of dec 30 far surpassing the previous high total of 287 set in 
1969 police blame drugs particularly the arrival of crack cocaine 
for about 60 percent of the slayings as recently as 1986 
drugrelated killings accounted for just onethird of the citys 
homicide total 
although final population and homicide figures have yet to be 
compared washington and detroit had the two highest percapita 
murder rates in america in 1988 meaning the nations capital could 
earn the dubious honor of being the nations murder capital as well 
ironically the absence of organized crime in washington may be 
pushing the murder total even higher law enforcement officials note 
that in cities where organized crime factions control the drug 
market there are fewer drugrelated slayings 
what you have here is a lot of young entrepreneurs fighting 
among themselves for drug turf said police chief maurice t 
turner they are just working for themselves 
stemming the citys drug tide has become an increasingly tough 
battle for turner and his 3800 officers 
earlier this year police switched to 9mm semiautomatic handguns 
out of fear that weapons commonly found on the street were 
outclassing the standard 38caliber sixshot revolver officers have 
been carrying 
the new weapons which allow officers to fire an extra 10 shots 
before reloading were ordered after drug raids frequently resulted 
in the seizure of uzi submachine guns and other sophisticated 
weaponry surveying the weapons at a march news conference turner 
called the districts streets something out of the wild wild 
west officers will have their new guns by 1990 
and police have learned that simply arresting more drug suspects 
hasnt sated the citys appetite for narcotics a highlytouted 
antidrug program operation clean sweep has produced more than 
46000 arrests since its august 1986 inception 
however turner has complained that the program which sends 
swarms of officers through druginfested neighborhoods to make 
arrests has done little more than further clog the citys 
alreadyovercrowded jail and court systems 
for each drug dealer arrested another springs forward according 
to turner 
a lot of these kids are high school dropouts with few 
skills turner said they can make up to a 1 million a year 
selling drugs what would you do 
us attorney for the district of columbia jay b stephens who 
can prosecute both local and federal crimes earlier this month 
announced that he is assigning five senior prosecutors to work 
solely on drugrelated killings in the district 
turner has also called on city officials to spend more money on 
drug education prevention and treatment programs currently a 
threeweek wait is common for persons wanting to enroll in the 
citys treatment centers 
what does the future hold police hope that as markets are more 
firmly established for crack a highlyaddictive cocaine derivative 
the murder rate will decrease 
this is one of the last major cities in this country to have an 
infusion of crack turner said when crack arrived in other 
cities like new york murder rates went up there too

a sightseeing cruise boat crowded 
with new years eve revelers capsized and sank and at least 42 
people drowned authorities said sunday 
a survivor said foreigners were on board and rio morgue 
officials said they were calling foreign consulates to help identify 
bodies 
the cruise boat a popular local sightseeing attraction called 
the bateau mouche was taking people to see a new years fireworks 
display off famous copacabana beach 
we dont know the exact cause of the sinking but we think it 
was because of excess capacity said maj oldemiro santos of the 
rio de janeiro state fire departments maritime group who 
coordinated rescue work he confirmed the figure of 42 dead and said 
perhaps 130 people had been on board 
earlier a radio operator for the fire departments sea rescue 
service said the bateau mouche had collided with a private yacht 
the casa branca but santos said the casa branca was simply one of 
many boats that stopped to aid bateau mouche victims 
irineu barroso the chief of rios 10th police precinct with 
jurisdiction over the bayfront neighborhood closest to the disaster 
also said 42 people had drowned 
it seems there was an excess of passengers maybe 130 to 150 on 
board barroso told the associated press a local radio station 
said the bateau mouche has a capacity of about 100 we understand 
the boat was told to turn back but ignored the order barroso said 
maj santos said the sinking occurred at 1145 pm saturday 
845 pm est in very rough seas 
a brazilian woman who said she survived by hanging onto a 
floating table told the privately owned globo tv network she was 
with a group that included italians and that there were other 
foreigners aboard 
the woman whose name was not immediately available also 
verified barrosos statement about the order to turn back she said 
port authority officals stopped the bateau mouche when it already 
was out on the water seemed to be counting passengers and made the 
boat retrun to its bayfront mooring 
but then she said the cruise boat simply set out again 15 
minutes later 
the bateau mouche makes daily sightseeing cruises across 
guanabara bay where tourists can admire the mountain scenery that 
surrounds rio 
the new years eve program widely advertised in newspapers was 
to leave the bay pass by sugarloaf mountain and anchor in the 
atlantic ocean off copacabana beach 
a fireworks display was set off at the beach at midnight saturday 
rios new years fireworks show in the southern hemispheres 
summer routinely draws 1 million people to the beach and hundreds 
of small craft off shore

an earthen dike broke early sunday 
forcing the evacuation of an estimated 1500 people for several 
hours and closure of a major interstate highway authorities said 
police said the 2500footlong dike a section of the quail 
creek dam on the virgin river about 14 miles east of here broke 
eight minutes after midnight 
the 50foothigh dike released a wall of water 10 feet to 12 feet 
high said mike brunn a member of the washington county search and 
rescue team who watched the water gush through the river channel 
if you had had a surfboard you could have just rode the wave 
it was that forceful brunn said 
no injuries were reported washington county sheriffs deputies 
reported seeing apparently empty vehicles carried along by the 
floodwaters but there were no immediate reports of people missing 
dispatcher melody murdock said deputies reported seeing two 
recreational vehicles and a pickup in the river 
st george city manager gary esplin said numerous homes were 
flooded in some of the areas evacuated in the communities of 
bloomington bloomington hills washington fields and parts of 
washington city 
washington county sheriffs dispatcher thad mattson said about 
daybreak that people were beginning to return to their homes 
the water pretty well has receded down mattson said its 
headed down the gorge and into the arizona end of it most of the 
people who have been evacuated are returning 
esplin said three bridges in st george and washington city were 
destroyed or rendered useless 
st george police chief john pollei said water was pouring 
through an everwidening gap in the dike which contains quail creek 
reservoir on the south side he said the dam itself which is also 
earthen and faces southeast was not damaged 
the high water forced the closure of interstate 15 the main 
route between salt lake city and los angeles south of st george 
where the freeway enters the narrow virgin river gorge the break is 
located about 250 miles south of salt lake city 
utah highway patrol dispatcher shirley iker said there was no 
water on the road but travel through the winding gorge was 
considered hazardous mattson said the road would be closed until 
later in the day when state officials would inspect a bridge running 
over the virgin river as a precaution 
iker said the nevada highway patrol had blocked traffic from 
approaching the gorge from the south and arizona authorities had 
set up roadblocks on side roads that access the passage 
the south end of the gorge is in arizona a few miles from the 
nevada border 
the national weather service issued a flashflood warning for 
areas along the river southward from the dam to the arizona border 
pollei said the virgin river bridge on utah 9 below the dam was 
completely under water severing the highway between the towns of 
st george and hurricane 
the cause of the break was not known he said a leak was noticed 
in the dike as early as 10 pm 
pollei also said he had no precise figure on how many homes had 
been evacuated however local mormon church authorities opened 
their chapels to evacuated families and local red cross officials 
appealed to community residents to open their homes to the displaced 
congested traffic was reported on utah 9 west of the bridge and 
on local arteries between bloomington and st george as residents 
attempted to move their families and livestock out of harms way 
officials said the evacuation effort initially was hampered by 
the new years holiday some residents assumed the citys civil 
defense siren was being sounded to herald the new year also many 
residents were away from their houses when authorities ordered the 
evacuation 
the flood knocked radio station ksgi off the air the stations 
transmission tower was only 50 feet from the river said news

india will start pulling its 
peacekeeping troops out of sri lanka this week at the request of 
presidentelect ranasinghe premadasa the indian government 
announced sunday 
premadasa who takes office monday promised during the election 
campaign to send the indian soldiers home 
india sent an estimated 50000 troops to the indian ocean island 
in july 1987 hours after an accord was signed to end an insurgency 
by tamil rebels demanding a separate homeland in the north and east 
provinces 
india will withdraw two battalions in the next few days the 
indian high commission or embassy in colombo announced at a news 
conference 
i cannot give you the mathematics of how many troops will be 
involved but from what i know from 2000 to 3000 troops making up 
two brigades will be withdrawn said hm dixit the indian high 
commissioner 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi and sri lankas outgoing 
president junius r jayewardene discussed the withdrawal saturday 
during a summit of seven south asian countries in islamabad 
pakistan dixit said 
opponents of the peace accord had feared indian troops sent to 
the island to disarm the tamil rebels and enforce a ceasefire might 
remain on the island indefinitely 
the withdrawal is being done because we respect the public 
sentiments in sri lanka and this is sincere declaration that we 
have no intention of staying permanently in sri lanka dixit said 
india the regional power got involved in the conflict because 
60 million tamils living in southern india are sympathetic to the 
rebels cause more than 626 indian soldiers have died while trying 
to enforce the agreement 
tamils like the indians are mostly hindus they make up 18 
percent of the islands 16 million people 
tamils have long accused the predominantly buddhist sinhalese of 
denying them jobs education and money for development the 
sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the countrys population 
control the government and the military 
militant tamils have been demanding an independent nation in the 
north and east provinces where tamils concentrate they have 
rejected the governments offer of limited autonomy if they 
surrender their weapons and end the 5yearold guerrilla war that 
has left more than 8500 people dead 
the accord also enraged sinhalese radicals who contend it grants 
too many concessions to the tamils and brought indian troops across 
the narrow 18mile palk straits to sri lankan soil militants have 
been blamed for the deaths of more than 900 people most supporters 
of the agreement 
but dixit said that during the last few months the process of 
normalization has commenced and matters can be resolved in a 
reasonable and amicable way 
as the situation improves further as the devolution of powers 
becomes effective as the indosri lanka agreement gets 
progressively implemented and as the mischiefmaking potential of 
extremist elements opposed to the agreement is reduced the 
government is hopeful of making further withdrawals dixit said

israeli soldiers with powerful binoculars 
peer into the rocky expanse of southern lebanon after warnings that 
palestinian guerrillas opposed to the plos peace overtures may try 
to infiltrate israel 
armed palestinians have approached the barbed wire fence along 
the border twice on dec 26 and dec 28 and six of them were 
killed by israeli soldiers several rockets were fired into the 
region from lebanon on friday 
army officials say they believe radical factions of the palestine 
liberation organization may step up their attempts to infiltrate and 
attack israeli civilians to sabotage the plos movement toward 
negotiation after plo chairman yasser arafat recognized israel 
maj gadi commander of a battalion stationed in this northern 
village sees another new danger in a peace treaty signed in beirut 
lass than two weeks ago by the plo and amal the lebanese shiite 
moslem militia 
the amal are acting as guides and bringing the terrorists up to 
the border says gadi whose last name cannot be used under army 
regulations 
to 25yearold capt yossi and other soldiers all infiltrators 
are terrorists whose purpose is to attack civilian settlements many 
of them collective farms that grow apples 
there have been more than 20 major attempts to sneak into israel 
from lebanon this year some of them by sea battles between 
infiltrators and israeli troops have claimed the lives of five 
soldiers and more than 25 guerrillas 
in the more than two months gadis soldiers have been stationed 
in avivim they have fought two battles with lebanese guerrillas 
three guerrillas were killed gadi said but we are lucky there 
are no casualties on our side 
the three infiltrators carried sovietdesigned kalashnikov 
rifles grenades and rocketpropelled launchers 
in the border sector next to gadis israeli soldiers escaped 
injury in two recent battles with palestinian guerrillas army 
officials say the guerrillas target was kibbutz manara a 
collective farm visible from a hilltop lookout post near avivim 
gadi who at 29 has served 11 years in the army says 23 civilian 
settlements lie in the 12mile border strip under his command 
israels elaborate border defenses against guerrilla attacks 
includes a security zone on the lebanese side patrolled by israeli 
soldiers and an israelibacked christian militia in lebanon 
near avivim the zone stretches from 1 miles to seven miles 
north of the border mines are buried just inside lebanon and 
rusting rolls of concertina barbed wire are strung along both sides 
of the border 
touching the electronic border fence sets off alarms that army 
officers say can indicate to within about 100 yards where the 
trouble is 
on the israeli side a road is patrolled by israeli trucks and a 
dusty strip is swept frequently so that any footprints can be 
detected 
still says yossi both palestinian and lebanese shiite 
guerrillas keep trying to penetrate the barrier it takes only 
five minutes to cut the fence he says 
yossi says the infiltrators trick is to try to sneak up as close 
as possible during the day then cut through the fence at night 
there are teenagers sent into the border who dont stand a 
chance he noted 
the army says palestinian guerrillas have carried leaflets saying 
they want to take civilian hostages to trade for colleagues jailed 
in israel claims of responsibility often call for liberating arab 
land lost with the creation of israel in 1948 
about 300 yards from the border an israeli collective farm 
called kibbutz malkiyya is protected by a soldier at the gate a 
nearby army lookout post and rolls of concertina wire 
across the fence lebanese farmers can be seen tending fields 
neatly divided by stones and herding sheep arab villages sit on 
hilltops in the distance 
its green and nice until the shooting starts says gadi

defense lawyers deride them as snitches 
swine and creeps an underworld of jailhouse informants who 
curry favor with prosecutors and win rewards for incriminating 
testimony 
now a disclosure by one informant of how easily a prisoner can 
frame someone with bogus testimony has exploded into scandal for the 
nations largest district attorneys office though prosecutors say 
only a tiny fraction of cases involve jailhouse informants they are 
reviewing more than 130 cases of the past decade for possible taint 
by lying informants 
among the convictions being reviewed are such highprofile 
prosecutions as those of the socalled hillside strangler angelo 
buono the freeway killer william bonin and skid row slasher bobby 
joe maxwell also under scrutiny is the ongoing mcmartin preschool 
molestation trial in which an informant was a key witness against 
defendant raymond buckey 
the district attorneys office also is reevaluating its policy 
on use of jailhouse informants as witnesses and two attorney groups 
have asked the grand jury to appoint a special prosecutor to 
investigate the situation 
its a corruption of the system said leslie abramson 
president of california attorneys for criminal justice they 
prosecutors shouldnt be using these people because they should 
know that theyre lying 
assistant district attorney curt livesay thirdranking official 
in the office said most prosecutors abhor the use of informants 
but they provide valuable information 
jailhouse informants are liars thieves murderers criminals 
they would put their mothers in prison in their stead if they 
could he said but they help us solve crimes we wouldnt 
otherwise solve 
the incident that spurred the debate in los angeles legal 
community involves leslie white a repeat offender and longtime 
informant who frequently testified against other prisoners 
in return he said he received furloughs from prison a 
recommendation for parole a reduction of bail and 1800 from a 
witness protection fund as well as 900 for his wifes relocation 
then in october white demonstrated to authorities that by using 
a jail telephone and posing as a bail bondsman a prosecutor or 
police detective he could gather enough information about a murder 
case to concoct a confession by a defendant he had never met 
a defense lawyer who heard of the demonstration took the story to 
the media and white became a cause celebre he admitted he had 
committed perjury in more than one case and suggested that some men 
may have gone to death row partly because of informants false 
testimony 
with his newfound celebrity status the 31yearold white 
reportedly has hired an agent to represent him for book and movie 
deals 
the district attorneys office has been under fire since whites 
disclosures 
district attorney ira reiner who heads an 800prosecutor agency 
promised an investigation that would be one of the most 
thoroughgoing and most forthcoming inquiries that any department has 
ever made 
he also defended the use of informants saying informants tell 
us where the body is buried they tell us where the gun that was 
used in the killing can be found you cant turn the other ear 
nor should you responsibly turn the other way 
attorney robert berke who filed a lengthy brief for california 
attorneys for criminal justice in its campaign for a special 
prosecutor says los angeles county has paid hundreds of thousands 
of dollars to jailhouse informants which may constitute malfeasance 
by public officials prosecutors generally describe any payments as 
expenses to relocate people who are leaving jail for example 
when incentives like this are available to people under 
sentence in jail desperate people you get unreliable testimony 
said berke 
attorney gigi gordon head of the los angeles criminal courts bar 
associations informant investigation committee equated such 
payments to bribery 
where did anyone get the idea that they have to give an 
informant anything she asked 
the real tragedy said ms abramson is that they only use 
these guys in cases where the evidence is weak so they are 
increasing the risk of convicting the innocent 
livesay said the number of cases in which informants testify make 
up little more than 1 percent of the total felonies filed by his 
office each year and agreed that the cases are often the weaker 
ones 
theres not a public prosecutor in the world who wants to call 
a jailhouse informant as a witness he said it detracts from 
the case typically theyre called when you have a case with a hole 
in it 
but the prosecutor expressed skepticism about the role of defense 
attorneys saying they sometimes offer to have their own clients 
turn informant 
while we have defense attorneys lamenting the use of jailhouse 
informants when the informant is their client theyre the first 
ones in our office he said 
thats the most despicable thing ive ever heard ms 
abramson responded when you run around offering immunity to 
murderers you have no right to get on a moral high horse 
my clients are not informants i do not represent professional 
snitches

in the year since an oil spill fouled two 
rivers and threatened drinking water in three states the company 
responsible has been indicted inspectors have been fired and new 
laws proposed 
and still in question is the longterm environmental damage of 
the spill that killed millions of fish in parts of the monongahela 
and ohio rivers 
we have had a major change in the river that has to be studied 
and watched these are of grave concern said tom proch fish 
biologist with the pennsylvania department of environmental 
resources 
but dr edgar berkey of the center for hazardous materials 
research at the university of pittsburgh who supervised a 750000 
study funded by ashland oil inc said the most significant effects 
of the spill occurred over the short term and these are largely 
past 
last jan 2 a rebuilt ashland oil storage tank holding more than 
38 million gallons of diesel fuel collapsed at the companys 
terminal 25 miles south of pittsburgh 
a tidal wave of 705000 gallons of oil surged into the 
monongahela which was swollen and swift from heavy rains 
emergency workers recovered about 30 percent of the fuel but 
most of the oil entered the ohio river at downtown pittsburgh and 
kept moving into ohio and west virginia threatening drinking water 
supplies for millions of people 
about 23000 suburban pittsburgh residents lost tap water for 
nearly a week until the heaviest pollution passed their water 
companies intakes and several businesses and schools were closed 
for a few days 
an apologetic ashland oil took the blame and paid the bills it 
agreed to clean up the soil and ground water at the terminal 
inspect its 150 facilities nationwide and pay damage claims 
associated with the spill 
the ashland kybased company so far has paid 17 million or 
about 80 percent of 6000 claims said ashland spokesman roger 
schrum 
but the companys contrition didnt spare it from criminal 
charges particularly after engineers determined a dimesized flaw 
in the steel wall of the oil tank caused its collapse and a state 
task force concluded ashland was negligent 
on sept 15 a federal grand jury indicted ashland on two 
misdemeanor counts for allegedly violating the federal clean water 
and refuse acts and a state investigation is still under way 
ashland reacted bitterly to the charges and produced a 1986 memo 
from the allegheny county fire marshals office confirming the 
companys claim that it had approval to begin construction of the 
rebuilt tank county officials had long denied that any permission 
was given 
three people in the fire marshals office including the chief 
resigned or were fired over what their superiors called shoddy work 
practices 
meanwhile a flurry of federal and state legislation pertaining 
to aboveground storage tanks has been proposed but nothing has 
been enacted rep doug walgren a pennsylvania democrat said he 
plans to reintroduce his bill to regulate aboveground storage tanks 
when congress returns this month 
the spill killed roughly 2000 ducks nesting along the rivers in 
pennsylvania and injured others few ducklings hatched in the spring 
it is believed the kill in pennsylvania was limited to about 
11000 fish but downriver in west virginia about 3 million dead 
fish were counted a state report said 
the higher count in west virginia is believed to be due to a 
slower current and the oil mixing with sediments and sinking to the 
river bottom where fish feed in the winter explained berkey 
berkey said heavy rains that began around jan 19 dispersed the 
oil deposited on the river bottom preventing similar problems 
downriver 
the rain pretty much cleaned the system he said the bulk 
of the spill is south of new orleans by now but in such diluted 
quantities that it would be difficult to identify 
despite the kill proch said fishing in the ohio monongahela and 
allegheny rivers this year was reported to be good 
a major cause for concern however is an apparent decline of 
minnows a key food for game fish but berkey said there have been 
extreme fluctuations in the minnow population in the past decade for 
reasons not known 
he agreed that additional studies should be conducted 
alan vicory director of the cincinnatibased ohio river valley 
water sanitation commission said he does not believe the rivers 
pose a health risk to humans 
but i certainly think there is a question about the longterm 
impacts he said

a missing teen whom sheriffs stopped looking for 
because they considered him a runaway was found hungry and 
disoriented in a national forest where he had been lost and 
wandering for six days 
andrew campbell 15 was found with frostbitten hands and toes 
in an oak grove of cleveland national forest by a father and son out 
for a drive campbells parents were in another part of the forest 
still searching for their son who had gotten lost returning from a 
fishing trip dec 24 
how can you give up when its your own son you just cant 
said leonard campbell the boys stepfather who expressed anger at 
authorities for giving up on the boy 
campbell was listed in fair condition sunday at sharp memorial 
hospital where he was taken friday by ambulance following his 
rescue 
he looks pretty sunken like he needs to have some food 
pauline renner a hospital spokeswoman had said saturday but 
aside from that hes pretty alert and with it 
renner said the boy had frostbitten feet and toes nighttime 
temperatures dipped into the 20s for several days while the boy was 
missing according to weather forecasters 
a staff nurse who refused to give her name said campbell was 
transferred out of the hospitals intensive care unit saturday 
morning and into a generalcare ward the nurse said the family 
requested no other information be released 
authorities abandoned the search for campbell on tuesday after 
dogs trailing his scent lost it near a roadside despite his 
parents protests sheriffs officials said they believed campbell 
who once ran away from home hitched a ride out of the forest and 
was safe 
the boy initially was listed as a runaway when his mother debbie 
campbell reported to the sheriffs department that he was missing 
the department changed his status when his parents complained about 
the runaway designation 
at the hospital friday leonard campbell said he was upset over 
the sheriffs departments decision to end the search 
they have their political situation over there and they have 
things they have to do he said 
a statement issued saturday by the sheriffs department said 
officials will review how the search was handled for campbell 
volunteer search and rescue units used horses and dogs to look for 
the teenager until the hunt was called off the department will 
continue to retrace his tracks to determine how he became lost 
the statement said 
campbell was rescued by bill orsborn 60 a retired firefighter 
from la mesa and his son mark 29 
he was just off under some oak trees wandering around bill 
orsborn said friday night he was disoriented he didnt know 
where he was how long he was out there or what day it was 
the boy told the orsborns he survived by eating snow and fish he 
caught but said little else about the ordeal 
campbell was reunited with his mother and stepfather soon after 
he was found as the orsborns drove him out of the forest young 
campbell recognized the family car in a parking area the parents 
were nearby searching for the boy 
campbell said the boy survived because he was resourceful and had 
warm clothing 
what saved him was his field jacket because it had a hood on it 
and he was able to pull it up around his head to keep himself 
warm he said

to the judges bench to adopt their teddy bears gi joes and baby 
dolls but they mean every word of their pledges to be good parents 
the kids come in and i place them under oath ask them a few 
questions and issue a certificate said clark superior court judge 
george a jacobs who conducts the annual adoption proceedings for 
new christmas toys

here to help not hurt them said jacobs 42 
fiftytwo children from this southeastern indiana community 
trekked to the courtroom on saturday to become part of the tradition 
jacobs began in 1984 when cabbage patch dolls complete with their 
own adoption papers were popular 
that year 700 children participated since then jacobs has 
performed 50 to 150 adoptions each year some of the children are 
themselves adopted brought to the ceremony by their parents to show 
them what an adoption is like 
the adopted toys tend to become permanent playthings jacobs said 
instead of losing their luster as the christmas charm fades the

the judge in the ptl bankruptcy case 
called for stricter scrutiny of religious groups in newspaper 
interviews in which he described former ptl leader jim bakker as a 
little sawedoff runt 
rufus reynolds who retired saturday as a us bankruptcy judge 
told the greensboro news amp record that television ministries are 
wide open for mismanagement or corruption he also said he 
received death threats while he was handling the case 
i think congress should pass a very strong act forcing the irs 
internal revenue service to make them comply with an 
accounting reynolds said we have all kinds of laws protecting 
consumers religion is just another consumer item just the same as 
selling soap or washing powders or aspirin 
in a separate interview with the charlotte observer the 
81yearold reynolds said he was amazed at the response to the 
travails that brought down bakkers evangelistic empire 
what puzzled me was why people were interested in that little 
sawedoff runt reynolds said 
the ptl founder sunday criticized the judges comments 
i am shocked to find judge reynolds so prejudiced toward us 
and to hear of him making fun of us and the ptl partners bakker 
said in a statement released by one of his attorneys he should 
not have tried the ptl case with these feelings against us 
the interviews were published sunday the day after reynolds 
tenure in the bankruptcy case ended with his retirement 
the ministry filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws 
in june 1987 three months after bakker resigned from ptl amid a 
sexandmoney scandal 
two months ago reynolds ordered bakker his wife tammy and 
former aide david taggart to repay ptl nearly 77 million in 
benefits he found to be excessive last month he approved the sale 
of ptl assets to a canadian businessman 
it was also last month that a federal grand jury indicted bakker 
and former top aide richard dortch on criminal fraud and conspiracy 
charges accusing them of diverting more than 4 million in ptl 
money for their own benefit bakker is scheduled to appear in us 
district court in charlotte on jan 17 
upon his retirement reynolds told the observer that he left the 
ptl case discouraged and somewhat cynical 
for the first time as a bankruptcy judge reynolds was guarded by 
us marshals he said the fbi investigated death threats 
i didnt know christians could be so critical they would just 
chew me out reynolds said 
when a woman called the bankruptcy court in columbia to find out 
if he was a christian i said you tell her i was when i started 
this case but now i plead the fifth amendment 
in talking with the news amp record reynolds said he would like to 
see closer government regulation of all notforprofit corporations

it may not be everyones idea of a good time 
especially coming on the heels of new years eve but the 49 men and 
women who plunged into the icy waters of boston harbor on sunday 
seemed to enjoy themselves 
to keep up the 85year tradition of the l street brownies 
swimming club men and women ranging in age from teenagers to 
octogenarians took the yearly new years morning dip in the harbor 
before they ran down the strip of beach into the water club 
president paul levenson apologized to onlookers for the mild 
weather over which we have no control it was 25 degrees outside 
not bad said al binari 55 of somerville as he exited the 
29degree water wearing nothing more than a brief pair of swimming 
trunks 
it was great said frances tobin who appeared to be in her 
50s and said it was her first winter swim i said i was going to 
do it and i did it 
many of the swimmers are longtime members of the l street 
brownies a swimming club which has its headquarters at the l street 
bathhouse in south boston many like george graney 75 jerry 
collins 82 and joe alecks 77 have been swimming yearround for 
decades 
we do it for health reasons said graney its a 
discipline we do it every day like joggers some days we have to 
chop the ice away before we go in 
they do it for their sex lives retorted paul wolan 78 who 
stopped swimming yearround recently but still takes daily dips from 
march until november 
one of the younger club members peter jurzynski 37 scoffed at 
questions about the cleanliness of boston harbor which was an issue 
in last years presidential campaign 
the yuppies go to the caribbean we have the crystal clear 
waters of boston harbor jurzynski said 
the group clustered together for a photograph before the swim 
several wearing new years eve hats and others reluctant to discard 
their shirts and sweatpants until the last minute 
collins who said hes been swimming on new years day since 
1925 walked out of the water smiling 
really refreshing he said

a bespectacled language professor says no 
one got his side of the story before mistakenly arresting him 
because of a note he found that threatened to blow up an american 
airlines jetliner 
now that his ordeal is over peter m canning 40 said at a news 
conference saturday hes headed for a job interview at yale 
university he was on his way tuesday to a new orleans convention 
where he hoped to have several job interviews when a stewardess 
mistakenly thought a note canning found in his traytable was a bomb 
threat written by him 
i thought it was a nightmare at first it occurred to me that i 
might wake up said canning a lecturer at the university of 
california at berkeley 
he said he hasnt decided whether to sue anyone over the false 
charge of making a bomb threat tuesday aboard flight 240 from san 
francisco to dallas he was arrested in albuquerque nm where the 
plane made an emergency landing 
charges were dropped thursday after an 11yearold boy admitted 
he wrote the note and left it on the plane the boy took the flight 
just before cannings and had sat in the same seat as canning 
when the dropping of the charges was announced jim nelson the 
fbis top agent in new mexico said he regretted any inconvenience 
or embarrassment suffered by mr canning but said the arrest was 
justified based on what agents knew at the time 
cannings attorney in albuquerque ray twohig said he has 
advised canning to wait a week or so before deciding what action to 
take 
canning in his first statement since charges were dropped told 
how he handed the note to a flight attendant after it fell into his 
lap from a foldout tray after lunch 
part of the note said there is bombs planted all over this 
airplane two minutes into reading this i thought it was 
placed there as a prank said canning a slightly built man who 
wore tinted glasses jeans and a wool sports coat 
he told reporters he gave the crumpled twopage note to a flight 
attendant who walked to the front of the plane 
thirty seconds later she returned and said is this your note 
and i said no it is not but before i could say anything else 
she spun on her heels she was understandably nervous but no one 
ever came back to ask me for an explanation he said 
the plane was diverted to albuquerque where canning was 
questioned by the fbi for two hours and arrested later authorities 
asked him to supply several handwriting samples 
i didnt start panicking i started getting angry said 
canning 
he was arraigned in federal court in new mexico and released on 
his own recognizance 
he learned that the charges had been dropped while driving back 
to berkeley in a rental car friday night because no airline would 
book him a seat he had stopped at a restaurant near the 
californiaarizona border and saw a newspaper headline 
im now relieved as you can imagine canning said 
before the incident canning was en route to the convention of 
the modern language association in new orleans where the harvard 
doctoral candidate hoped to attend several job interviews 
faculty members at yale agreed to reschedule his interview he 
said adding that it was too soon to tell whether missing several 
other interviews will hurt his career

organizers hoping to herd 10000 head of 
cattle through southcentral montana to celebrate the states 
centennial are facing problems never dreamed of by cowboys of 100 
years ago 
for one thing no one in 1889 had to worry about a water quality 
permit for another they are planning to move an unusually large 
number of cattle 
but organizers say theyre not deterred by questions of 
environmental impact or such cowboy insider worries as whether the 
cattle will balk when driven toward a river crossing at midday 
the problems will be overcome they say and the sixday drive 
will come off sept 4 through 9 one of a yearlong series of events 
celebrating montanas admission to the union on nov 8 1889 
interest in the drive spans several continents according to jim 
wempner a billingsarea rancher and director of the event however 
only 700 people so far have indicated they will participate he said 
wempner did not know how many cattle that included but said each 
person must consign at least one animal 
he said he expects the drive to involve 200 wagons and 5000 
cowboys including 100 experienced trail hands 
its going to happen wempner said despite numerous 
obstacles stemming from a statelevel review of the drives 
potential environmental impact 
we do the same thing for 2000 cattle as we would with 10000 
cattle he said theres not that much of a difference this is 
just a larger number 
organizers bill it as one of the largest cattle drives in history 
but state officials have questioned whether the sponsors will be 
able to overcome problems including the handling of wastes created 
by people and livestock along the 58mile route between roundup and 
billings 
outgoing lt gov gordon mcomber chairman of the state 
centennial commission said experienced cattlemen also have 
criticized the plan 
he said they cite behavioral quirks of cattle that could lead to 
problems such as a possibility the animals might refuse to cross a 
river during the heat of the day the angle of the sun may make it 
impossible for the cattle to see the bottom causing them to balk 
those things are long forgotten in this day and age mcomber 
said 
organizers need permits and water quality variances to allow 
cattle to cross rivers and streams and possibly air quality 
variances if cattle are moved along dusty dirt roads officials said 
people from across the united states and two from australia have 
applied to participate wempner said adding that filmmakers from 
west germany france and switzerland have shown interest in 
documenting the event 
wempner estimated it would cost 500000 to stage the drive 
among the other events planned for the centennial is a 250mile 
wagon train trek being organized by the montana draft horse and mule 
association 
more than 80 wagons 17 riding groups 367 horses and 301 people 
are registered and about a halfdozen others are on a waiting list 
for the trip planned for june and july

house republican leader bob michel said sunday 
a tax increase probably will be part of a bipartisan budget 
compromise in 1989 despite presidentelect bushs pledge to oppose 
higher taxes 
the illinois republican two days before the new congressional 
session said he does not believe there is enough room to cut 
spending to meet deficitreduction targets 
i dont know that there is that much flexibility michel 
said when i served on the budget summit the last time around we 
found we had to take a measure of that tax increases i suspect 
that down the road a piece that may be part of the answer 
but senate minority leader bob dole rkan said he takes bushs 
opposition to more taxes at face value 
my view is the same as the presidentelect george bush dole 
said i didnt coin the phrase read my lips but i think he 
means it and i dont see any give in that area at this point 
bush repeatedly stressed his opposition to taxes during the 
presidential campaign by urging any doubters to read my lips 
michel and dole were interviewed on abcs this week with david 
brinkley along with house majority leader tom foley dwash and 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
the 101st congress convenes tuesday for a swearingin with 
committee hearings on republican cabinet appointees among the first 
order of business prior to the jan 20 inauguration 
the congressional leaders expressed agreement that bush should 
make the first move in proposing answers 
the presidentelect should go first dole said we know 
were going to have to face it my own view is it a compromise 
will come together 
michel foley and mitchell questioned about the upcoming trial 
of former white house aide oliver north on charges stemming from the 
irancontra affair agreed a sitting president should not be forced 
to appear in court to give testimony 
norths lawyers on friday subpoenaed both president reagan and 
bush to testify as defense witnesses at the trial 
there are ways a president can become a part of a trial said 
foley but his actual appearance in court is discouraged 
the house members suggested a statement by reagan or bush given 
out of court might be satisfactory 
mitchell said there is a strong presumption against requiring 
a president to testify but mitchell said reagans legal protection 
against appearing in court may be reduced after he leaves office on 
jan 20 
mitchell also challenged the idea that reagans testimony would 
be helpful to north the senator said north testified during 
congressional hearings that he acted without reagans knowledge in 
funneling proceeds from iran arms sales to the nicaraguan rebels 
mitchell also said it would be improper for reagan to be 
pressured into pardoning north because of the possibility the 
president could be required to testify 
any special treatment for north would support the idea there are 
two standards of justice for government officials and everyone 
else mitchell said

two men investigating a house burglary on 
their own used a gun to deliver a teenage suspect to police 
but it was the two men who ended up charged in the incident police 
said sunday 
you cant be your own vigilante said police lt james 
gabriel 
allen lane calvey 57 and nikita j vambaketes 36 were charged 
by the madison county states attorney with aggravated unlawful 
restraint a felony following the incident wednesday said police 
in this southern illinois city 
calvey whose home was burglarized in late november also was

to go to the alton police station gabriel said calvey took teague 
inside while vambaketes who then took the gun stayed in the car 
according to gabriel 
gabriel said police had no evidence that teague was involved in 
the burglary so he was not charged in the incident but teague was 
arrested on a warrant for a past misdemeanor charge of failure to 
appear in court on a retail theft charge police said 
calvey was freed on a 25000 bond soon after his arrest police 
said vambaketes remained in the madison county jail in lieu of 
13000 bond sunday awaiting a court appearance said a jail 
employee who did not give his name 
the teenager meanwhile pleaded guilty thursday to failure to 
appear in court and was released after being ordered to pay a 100 
fine and court costs gabriel said 
gabriel said he was not sure if anything was taken in the 
burglary of calveys home 
lt robert lahlein chief of detectives said the two men 
exceeded their authority 
illinois statute gives certain arrest powers to citizens but 
not under these circumstances he said thats why we have

the new year roared into lima sunday with a 
strong earthquake and on the heels of a blackout believed caused by 
leftist guerrillas officials said 
civil defense officials said they had no reports of damage or 
injury in the earthquake 
the quake struck at 516 am and registered at 55 on the 
richter scale said miguel morales a spokesman for the geophysical 
institute of peru he said the epicenter was in the pacific ocean 
70 miles southwest of lima 
the new year dawned with pervians facing their most serious 
economic recession this century with inflation expected to reach 
1800 percent this year last year also brought an upsurge in the 
shining path guerrilla movements eightyear insurgency to impose 
marxist rule 
saturday was the second new years eve in a row that lima a 
frequent target of power outages caused by rebels was hit by a 
blackout 
the problems did not stop lima residents from enjoying new years 
revelry including the widespread use of fireworks and burning 
traditional bonfires on dozens of city street corners 
the state power company electroperu said saboteurs blew up power 
pylons about 10 pm saturday to cause a partial power outage 
it said power was cut to isolated areas in a coastal region 
stetching from chiclayo 465 miles north of lima to marcona 270 
miles south of the capital 
about half of lima was blacked out but energy was restored to 
most areas by midmorning sunday electroperu said 
both of perus major rebel groups the maoinspired shining path 
and the procuba tupac amaru revolutionary movement have launched 
dozens of blackouts and then used the cover of darkness to carry out 
bombings and other attacks 
officials said they did not know which group caused the new 
years blackout and there were no reports of any related violence 
police say the shining path sabotaged power pylons three times in 
late november and early december in an escalation of its insurgency 
which has claimed more than 12000 lives 
the blackouts forced this city of 6 million to ration electric 
power and water which is pumped by electricty for three weeks 
before officials could repair the damaged system

a county jail inmate who noticed his cell was 
unlocked followed an offduty sheriffs deputy and wandered past two 
checkpoints to freedom authorities said 
somebody wasnt paying as much attention as he was supposed 
to said assistant chief deputy bob knowles detentions commander 
for the dallas county sheriffs department 
but arthur tabor 47 was back in jail early saturday a few 
hours after his disappearance police found him at the same address 
he had given police when he was arrested the first time a homeless 
shelter 
he faced the original charges of disorderly conduct and public 
intoxication plus a charge of escape and was held in lieu of 1568 
bond 
tabor was arrested friday and placed in a holding cell at the lew 
sterrett justice center before changing into jail clothes 
authorities said noticing the cell door was unlatched tabor walked 
out of the cell 
wearing a surgical mask because of tuberculosis tabor found a 
sheriffs officer and apparently followed the deputy because he was 
unsure of what he was supposed to do officials said 
he got into the elevator with the officer and the officer not 
realizing the man was a prisoner walked out of the building with 
him knowles said i dont think he intentionally tried to 
escape the charges were so minor i dont think there was any 
motivation 
they just opened the door and let him walk it was like merry 
christmas said sgt lonnie franks supervisor of the release 
section at the jail 
franks said tabor walked through two checkpoints staffed by 
uniformed jailers who are supposed to demand identification 
the incident embarrassed jail officials and knowles said 
deputies feel lucky that no violent prisoner escaped 
at least it wasnt someone who went out and hurt someone he

the government has begun investigating 
us allegations that a west german company helped libya build a 
chemical weapons plant a foreign ministry official said sunday 
the bonn government was informed of the us position through 
diplomatic channels the official said on condition of anonymity 
he said the review so far has yielded no evidence to support 
claims that german firms were involved in any illegal 
undertakings 
we have taken this information very seriously and immediately 
launched an investigation said the official 
us officials said last week that a chemical facility at rabta 
about 50 miles southwest of tripoli is on the verge of producing 
chemical weapons 
libya says the facility is a pharmaceutical plant 
companies from west germany japan and italy are believed to have 
helped libya build the plant or the adjacent industrial complex 
japan told the united states its nationals believed they were 
involved in the construction of a fertilizer plant 
at least two west german firms provided libya with chemicals 
technical assistance and special pumps and piping for the plant 
us news amp world report said in a report released sunday 
one of the west german companies was identified as 
imhausenchemie the new york times said sunday quoting us 
government officials 
the companys president denied any connection with the libyan 
plant the report said 
we produce medical substances and fine chemicals but not so 
far to libya the times quoted jurgen hippenstielimhausen as 
saying i never went to libya i dont even know where it is 
the times quoted american officials as saying imhausen was at the 
center of a covert operation in which materials for the chemical 
plant were shipped to libya through hong kong and other asian ports 
american officials said they were deliberately misled by a 
company called japanese steel works us news amp world report 
reported company officials told us senators the firm was only 
building a desalinization plant the report said 
the magazine quoting unidentified government sources said the 
state department has prepared a secret report on the role of west 
germany and japan in helping libya iran iraq and syria to acquire 
chemicalweapons capability 
us state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley on friday 
rejected libyan leader moammar gadhafis offer to let the united 
states inspect the plant 
she said a chemical weapons plant could easly be modified to 
appear as a legitimate industrial chemical plant such as a 
pharmaceutical or fertilizer facility

michael fane 21 was shot to death by a swat team sniper friday 
as police afraid fane would set off a fire bomb in the beauty 
salon rescued the last hostage 
police chief robert wadman said saturday that a preliminary 
review indicated that officers followed proper procedure when the 
police sniper fired the single shot that killed fane 21 of iowa 
city iowa 
fane who told the hostages he was on a mission for god was 
killed 24 hours after he walked into the salon and took eight people 
hostage none of the hostages released at intervals throughout the 
ordeal was hurt 
douglas county attorney ron staskiewicz said that his office will 
decide soon whether to call a grand jury to investigate 
the last thing i want to do is have police officers who have 
been involved in a traumatic situation wait a long time 
staskiewicz said we want to make a decision if a grand jury 
needs to be called lets get it over with 
fanes parents said the standoff could have been avoided if the 
sarpy county neb mental health board had followed the advice of a 
psychiatrist and the pleas of his mother to commit him to treatment 
the request for commitment came after an incident at a restaurant at 
which fane began screaming 
cathie fane of el campo texas said her son had been diagnosed 
as having druginduced schizophrenia 
but during the nov 4 committal hearing a decision was made 
against institutionalization because he posed no public threat mrs 
fane said 
we knew that he was gone a year ago she told the houston 
chronicle we tried to get help for him we tried to have him 
institutionalized but lawyers fought to keep him out of the 
institution so our hands were really tied 
but board members defended their decision 
richard wycoff a clinical psychiatrist said it was a close 
call as to whether fane should have been committed but there was 
not clear and convincing evidence that fane was a danger either 
to himself or to others 
joseph batorski the lay member of the threemember board also 
said it was not proven fane was dangerous

thirtyyearold documents made public new years 
day reveal the government sent commandos to oman to fight rebels 
threatening british interests in the persian gulf state a newspaper 
reported sunday 
the documents were released by the public records office under 
rules permitting publication of selected confidential papers after a 
30year lapse the observer said 
in 1958 rebels were fighting the sultan of oman and endangering 
britains plans to use an air base at masirah and its interest in 
oil deposits believed to exist in the kingdom the weekly newspaper 
said 
but the use of regular british troops to crush a rebellion was 
considered certain to attract international criticism and the newly 
released cabinet documents show how concerned thenprime minister 
harold macmillan and foreign secretary selwyn lloyd were to avoid 
such an outcome the observer said 
in july of 1958 the sultan accepted 23 british officers for his 
army including a commander and the nucleus of an air force to put 
down the rebels in return for handing over the base for 99 years 
the observer said 
the military assault plan was canceled over concerns about 
international criticism but a government panel suggested britain 
instead conduct a special operation by commandos of the clandestine 
special air services regiment 
the plan was approved and the cover story the newspaper said 
was that the 100man sas squadron was training the sultans army a 
second squadron was sent in december and by january 1959 the sas had 
put the rebels to flight the observer said 
britain has had close ties with the sultanate an absolute 
monarchy for nearly 200 years

a company offering quick cheap tests of 
blood cholesterol levels to people while they shop says technology 
has outpaced state laws governing medical testing but the state 
says the companys services dont have the proper licenses and has 
gone to court 
the lawsuit filed by the state department of health and 
rehabilitative services against heart chek of sarasota will be a 
test case for the fledgling industry attorneys say 
heart chek has contracts to offer cholesterol readings with 
several store chains throughout southwestern florida including 
publix albertsons and walgreen 
the procedure involves taking a few drops of blood from a 
fingertip and running the sample through a machine a reading is 
given within minutes for 7 
the state contends the process of drawing blood and analyzing it 
for cholesterol content falls under a 1967 statute regulating 
clinical laboratories said department spokesman stephen kindland 
but heart chek which has been in business since march believes 
the regulations are outdated said company attorney steve herb 
herb said the suit was initially filed by hrs against heart chek 
early this september in sarasota county circuit court 
but he argued that the 1967 statute cited in the suit was never 
intended to apply to screening procedures just clinical 
laboratories the technology used nationwide for screening 
cholesterol was not in existence at the time that statute was 
written herb said sunday 
hrs is trying to take an old law and apply it to a situation 
that could not possibly have been foreseen in 1967 he said 
the company which has 20 affiliates across the south and in 
california would like the new industry to be regulated by the 
state but not under the existing clinical laboratory law national 
president john bell said 
were fighting the particular law in florida not the idea of 
being under regulatory control we recognize the need to keep 
unqualified people out of the business bell said 
the state told the company it should be licensed by the 
department of licensure and certification but heart chek ignored a 
ceaseanddesist order leaving a lawsuit as the only option to 
settle the question said state health department attorney ed haman 
weve filed for a court injunction to decide whether heart chek 
does qualify as a clinical lab under the statute until that 
decision comes through we have no authority to stop the operation 
or regulate it at all haman said 
the state defines a clinical laboratory as any business 
performing examinations on material from the human body to obtain 
information on a medical condition 
heart chek has filed several countersuits against the state for 
interference with business slander and harassment 
a hearing on the merits of the countersuits is scheduled for jan 
13 but a final decision on the states suit is not expected until 
at least february said haman 
as far as we know this is the very first legal challenge to 
the clinical lab statute he said

suburbs that want to stake claim on the lakefront 
property of a centuryold army base are jockeying for position in a 
potential land grab should the government go through with plans to 
close the base 
fort sheridan which employs about 4000 people half of them 
civilians is one of 86 military installations targeted for closure 
by a pentagonappointed panel if the panels recommendations are 
accepted the bases could close between 1991 and 1995 
lake forest highwood and highland park officials are all looking 
at the bases 700 acres of beachfront real estate developing the 
land could help offset the economic woes that may follow closing the 
base 
i do think there is going to be a fight said state rep 
grace mary stern of highland park 
thats prime land along lake michigan added us rep john 
porter whose northsuburban district includes the base and 
surrounding communities its not on the tax rolls 
federal law calls for the army to give other federal agencies 
first dibs on the base a cluster of stone buildings that looks like 
a wooded college campus along a stretch of beach but porter said he 
knows of no federal interest in the land 
the state is second in line to get the land but david fields a 
spokesman for gov james thompson said he was not aware of any state 
plans for the land 
that leaves the three suburbs 
it has not yet been determined which if any of the communities 
would have jurisdiction over the land highwood tried to annex the 
whole base in the 1960s but the move was struck down in court a 
spokesman for the fort said 
lake county planning department documents show that the northern 
100 acres have been annexed by lake forest and the southernmost 150 
acres have been annexed by highland park leaving the middle 450 
acres unclaimed 
all the annexations dont mean a thing said highwood mayor 
fidel ghini you cant legally annex federal land 
ghini said highwood has plans for the land but he refused to say 
what they are 
did your football coach ever tell the opposition what he was 
going to do he said 
daniel pierce mayor of highland park said he opposed economic 
development of the land 
the first priority should be open space along the lake 
pierce said 
lake forest mayor marshall strenger could not be reached for 
comment the telephone at his home went unanswered sunday 
porter plans to meet with officials whose constituents would be 
affected by the closing including the three mayors state 
legislators and thompson 
it will be tough to get this thing reversed porter said 
so i want to get all the players together at the end of january to 
try to get cooperation between state and local officials

years revelers bound for a fireworks display at copacabana beach 
capsized and sank after ignoring an order to return to port 
officials said sunday at least 51 people died and others were 
missing 
the sightseeing ship was carrying at least 131 people 31 over 
capacity and sank in 65 feet of water in rios guanabara bay about 
1145 pm saturday authorities said 
we dont know the exact cause of the sinking but we think it 
was because of excess capacity said maj oldemiro santos of the 
rio de janeiro state fire departments maritime group 
authorities said a search for survivors was continuing some were 
believed trapped in the hull of the vessel said col jefferson 
cardoso de bem chief of the maritime group 
he said he had no accurate number of survivors or the number 
missing because several boats in the area took part in rescue 
attempts and survivors were taken to hospitals throughout the city 
among the dead was the boats captain 
the doubledecked ship bateau mouche sank between sugar loaf 
mountain and a small island as it rounded the bend on the western 
side of guanabara bay and prepared to enter the atlantic ocean 
the boat a popular tourist attraction that offers daily cruises 
of the bay was to anchor in the ocean so passengers could view the 
midnight fireworks display at copacabana beach 
the top deck was so crowded you could hardly move a 
brazilian woman told brazils tv globo the boat was completely 
full including lots of children then everything began shaking back 
and forth people were shouting its going to flip over 
passenger fabricio calo who was rescued by a fishing boat said 
the boat was turning and shifting then tables started flying 
glass started crashing and the whole boat just turned over on its 
side 
survivors said foreigners were on board the morgue in rio called 
foreign consulates for possible aid in identifying bodies but 
officials said they had no breakdown 
the rio newspaper o globo said sunday that an american may have 
been on board a marine guard who answered the phone at the us 
consulate said he was not authorized to give out any information 
about possible us victims 
the vessel was so crowded that a naval vessel ordered it to 
return to port but it ignored the order said irineu barroso chief 
of rios 10th police precinct 
survivors confirmed this account 
this was not an accident calo 38 a businessman from sao 
paulo said in an interview at the bateau mouches mooring station 
no effort was made to control the number of passengers who got 
on 
calo said that soon after the excursion started a patrol boat 
from brazils navyrun port authority circled the bateau mouche and 
appeared to be counting people 
he said two uniformed men from the boat then boarded the cruise 
boat and forced it to return to its dock but then only about 
five minutes later the bateau mouche went out again calo said 
paulo soares 28 a brotherinlaw of the bateau mouches 
captain camilo da costa 50 said at the mooring station camilo 
didnt want to go out he said the boat was overloaded and the sea 
was too rough but he had no choice he would lose his job if he 
didnt sail 
a spokesman for the sol e mar restaurant which organized the 
excursion said at least 131 people were on board according to an 
incomplete reservation list the spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity refused further comment

the french released hot air balloons in 98 locations 
sunday to launch the bicentennial of their revered revolution after 
preparations hampered by disorganization and modernday political 
strife 
they also ushered in the new year by turning on special lights on 
the eiffel tower to mark its 100th birthday the lights reading 
100 ans or 100 years stand 13 yards high and will be kept on 
all year both night and day at the paris monument 
the balloon launchings are among the first of many special events 
to be held throughout the year to celebrate the 200th anniversary of 
the french revolution festivities are to peak july 14 on the 200th 
anniversary of the storming of the bastille prison in 1789 an event 
that has come to symbolize the revolution 
organizers acknowledged criticism in recent months that they were 
far behind schedule in planning the bicentennial events after the 
deaths of two bicentennial mission chiefs forced quick changes of 
leadership 
moreover french pride in the watershed historical event did not 
prevent political bickering over how to remember it at one point 
paris conservative mayor jacques chirac who lost to socialist 
president francois mitterrand in may elections complained that the 
government wanted to emphasize those historical details that would 
serve their cause today 
also in sundays kickoff ceremonies a red and yellow helium 
balloon took flight at paris tuileries gardens carrying a man 
dressed in a wig and period costume and 300000 souvenir envelopes 
bearing a commemorative stamp showing three stylized birds went on

officer 
the indicator light was malfunctioning and replaced said

prime minister margaret thatcher distanced herself 
sunday from us vows to punish whoever planted the bomb that 
destroyed pan am flight 103 
i dont think an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth is ever 
valid she said in a wideranging new years television interview 
the most important thing to do is to try to get the cooperation 
of all nations to track these people down so that they are brought 
to justice she said on the david frost on sunday program on 
the commercial tvam channel 
the danger of revenge she said is that it can affect innocent 
people 
president reagan said in his weekly radio broadcast saturday that 
the united states would punish those responsible for the bomb which 
brought the boeing 747 down in southern scotland killing all 259 
people on board and leaving 11 on the ground missing and presumed 
dead 
he said a report overseen by presidentelect george bush 
advocating possible military action against terrorists ought to be 
giving some people sleepless nights in the wake of the dec 21 
bombing he did not elaborate 
bush vowed last week to seek hard and punish firmly 
decisively those who did this if you could ever find them 
fbi director william sessions said sunday the investigation of 
the crash could be lengthy and welcomed any help that plo chief 
yasser arafat might be able to provide 
arafat has a great deal of information a wealth of information 
he can give us sessions said on us network television 
the idea of such cooperation arises in the wake of newly opened 
talks between the us and palestine liberation organization 
officials that began after arafat disavowed terrorism and recognized 
israels right to exist 
last week the kuwaiti newspaper alseyasseh quoted an 
unidentified plo official as saying the organization was considering 
a request by us officials that the plo help in tracking down those 
responsible for the bombing 
sessions whose agency is helping in the crash investigation 
said he is optimistic of eventually finding out who planted the 
bomb he added that he has no evidence to confirm the bomb was the 
work of terrorists rather than someone acting against someone on 
board 
mrs thatcher allowed reagan to use us bombers based in britain 
to bomb libya in 1986 in retaliation for alleged libyan involvement 
in international terrorism 
she said sunday that no country should grant the pan am bombers 
safe haven or permit them to escape justice 
i think public opinion is disgusted with nations that will not 
try to track down terrorists absolutely disgusted 
us officials say no group has offered a credible claim of 
responsibility for the attack speculation on suspects has focused 
mostly on palestinian extremists and proiranian shiite moslems 
searchers in lockerbie scotland gave up their traditional new 
years celebrations sunday to continue the hunt for bodies and 
wreckage 
police said that one more body thought to be one of the missing 
local residents was recovered bringing the total to 242 
only 35 have been identified and released to relatives for 
burial capt bruce smith a pan am pilot whose english wife 
ingrid was killed was quoted in the sunday telegraph as saying the 
scottish police were paralyzed by inexperience and incompetence 
john boyd chief constable of the dumfries and galloway police 
replied at a news conference i am sure no one would thank me for 
shortcutting any legal or evidential gathering processes which may 
help to bring the person or persons responsible to justice 
more than 700 people are expected at a memorial service wednesday 
in lockerbie and 1000 more will watch on monitor screens in nearby 
halls 
british newspapers reported saturday that investigators believe 
the bomb was smuggled onto the flight in frankfurt possibly by a 
lebaneseborn passenger duped into carrying it the west german 
government said no evidence supports those reports 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt with a boeing 727 jet and 
switched to a boeing 747 at londons heathrow airport for the trip 
to new york 
the sunday times of london said the bomb was loaded into the 
airplanes forward cargo hold next to the electronic nerve center 
which keeps the jet airborne 
news reports in britain and the united states said the bomb may 
have been unwittingly brought on board the flight by khalid jaafar 
a 21yearold lebanese student khalid who was living in frankfurt 
was en route to dearborn mich to visit his father when he died in 
the crash 
his father nazir jaafar said the fbi questioned him about the 
reports friday and told him they have no evidence against my son

the soviet union soon will ban the export of 
consumer goods ranging from caviar to childrens shoes and will 
limit travelers to 160 worth of souvenirs the official news agency 
tass said sunday 
the radical changes in export and customs regulations evidently 
are aimed at remedying an extreme shortage of consumer goods in the 
soviet union and assuaging citizens angry over the scarcity of such 
basic items as soap and windshield wipers 
tass said the restrictions approved by the council of ministers 
will take effect feb 1 and last until the end of 1990 it did not 
give a date for the decision 
the brief announcement limiting exports of consumer goods to 100 
rubles or 160 under the governmentdecreed exchange rate per 
person specifically included tourists but it did not explain the 
effect of the ruling on the soviet unions attempts to earn scarce 
hard currency by selling the best caviar fur hats and coats vodka 
and souvenirs in stores that require dollars pounds or other freely 
convertible money 
tass said it will be forbidden to export televisions 
refrigerators freezers washing and sewing machines childrens 
clothing and shoes coffee and caviar 
coffee is not grown in the soviet union and the import duty is 
up to 15 a pound 
the announcement also said customs duties will climb to 20 to 100 
percent of the retail price on vacuum cleaners mixers 
coffeegrinders irons radios cameras automobile parts and other 
items it was not clear if this meant import or export duties 
export limits were imposed recently in czechoslovakia and several 
other east european countries after complaints that tourists from 
neighboring socialist nations were stripping their stores bare of 
consumer goods 
the growing practice prompted a soviet economist marina 
pavlovasilvanskaya to warn in soviet culture on sunday of an 
impending trade war among socialist countries 
many russians travel to eastern europe on shopping trips and ms 
pavlovasilvanskaya herself reminisced about trips to east germany 
and poland she said her boss insisted that the program had to 
include a visit to some institution named for lenin lest the 
germans or poles think the citizens of the nation of the great 
october revolution are coming to shop 
none of the socialist countries of eastern europe has fully 
convertible currencies and they trade with each other based on 
exchange rates that often do not cover the exporting countrys cost 
of production much less a profit 
ms pavlovasilvanskaya noted that capitalist countries dont 
find an invasion of shoppers a problem in fact just the reverse 
on nov 7 a holiday in hungary 100000 hungarians went to austria 
and spent 42 million in hard currency she wrote 
rather than limit exports the austrians responded to the horde 
of shoppers with advertisements in hungarian newspapers inviting 
them back on their next day off ms pavlovasilvanskaya noted

finance minister shimon peres on sunday unveiled 
an economic recovery plan aimed at reducing inflation by cutting 
wages and spending for defense health and welfare 
peres said at a news conference he plans to stimulate growth in 
the economy by pumping money into flagging industries and 
liberalizing investment regulations 
the proposed budget cut is 1 billion shekels or about 600 
million peres said the government adopted a 31 billion budget for 
1988 
about a quarter of the cuts will come out of defense spending 
putting at risk the jobs of up to 4000 defense industry employees 
israeli news reports said 
peres said his longrange aim is to reduce unemployment which he 
said hit 7 percent because of a lack of economic growth in the past 
year 
the plan was the most sweeping economic program introduced since 
a july 1985 program curbed annual inflation of 440 percent down to a 
current level of about 20 percent a year 
peres said he wants to reduce inflation to a singledigit figure 
by years end 
we must reach a european level of inflation to survive he 
said but did not give a specific target figure 
stability is endangered and we are liable to sink into a deep 
recession with continuing inflation our economy needs these 
measures like a breath of fresh air 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said he supports the new program 
i hope it will be accepted and implemented shamir said on 
israel radio adding that he hoped the budget cuts would not hurt 
too much 
the governments figures for last year reflect zero growth in 
production and gross national product and a drop in exports and 
tourism major sources of foreign currency many of the nations 
farms are debtridden and many factories are failing 
israeli officials have blamed the nearly 13month palestinian 
uprising in the occupied lands for some of the economic 
difficulties including the decline in tourism 
israel radio quoted peres as saying that the uprising led to a 2 
percent drop in israels gross national product a decrease of about 
600 million in exports to the occupied lands and a 30percent drop 
in tourism 
peres the former foreign minister proposed curbing inflation by 
cutting government spending on the army schools and hospitals and 
by halting the longstanding practice of giving automatic 
costofliving increases to salaried workers 
yisrael kessar leader of the nationwide histadrut labor union 
federation criticized the proposals 
it is inconceivable to force workers to bear the entire 
burden of this plan kessar said on army radio 
the cabinet heard a report about the plan at its weekly session 
but made no decisions about budget cuts while the cabinet was 
meeting however peres implemented other decisions related to the 
plan 
subsidies for food staples such as milk bread and frozen chicken 
were slashed raising their prices by up to 26 percent 
the bank of israel devalued the shekel by 8 percent against the 
us dollar after a 5 percent devaluation last week 
the devaluation was aimed at helping export industries which 
have been operating at a loss because the exchange rate was frozen 
peres outlined other proposals to help electronics textiles and 
other industries they include liberalizing regulations to encourage 
investment from abroad setting aside more funds for troubled 
factories that come up with viable recovery plans and lowering 
interest rates on loans

toniolo said the tower has leaned an average of 00508 inches 
over the past 60 years 
some years its a little less some years a little more he 
said there is no important variation this year the only time we 
would be worried would be if the tilt was more than 2 millimeters 
008 inches 
toniolo said if the tower continues to lean at the current rate 
it would topple over in 100 to 150 years 
begun in 1173 the tower was only 34 feet high when the soil 
underneath it began to give way causing it to tilt it was

it something new

an earthen dike gave way early sunday 
sending a 12foot wall of water down the virgin river that forced 
the overnight evacuation of 1500 people flooded homes and forced 
authorities to close interstate 15 
no injuries were reported 
if you had had a surfboard you could have just rode the wave 
it was that forceful said mike brunn a member of the washington 
county search and rescue team 
st george city manager gary esplin said that by noon 
electrical water and other utilities had been restored to areas 
that were flooded evacuees were being allowed to return to their 
homes as the floodwaters receded 
washington county officials said 50 to 60 homes and 100 
apartments were flooded numerous abandoned cars trucks and 
trailers in lowlying areas also were covered 
interstate 15 the main route between salt lake city and los 
angeles was closed south of st george where the freeway enters 
the narrow virgin river gorge officials reopened the freeway about 
14 hours later 
gov norm bangerter who flew to the area 300 miles south of salt 
lake city declared the region a disaster area which will help 
facilitate federal aid for the southwestern utah communities 
will we rebuild the answer is yes to that an unequivocal 
yes the governor said 
the failed dike which helped contain the quail creek reservoir 
was built in 1983 at a cost of 3 million 
bangerter said state engineers would try to determine the cause 
of the 300footwide breach in the dike located 14 miles east of 
this town of about 12000 
the 2500footlong earthen dike that broke is a section of the 
quail creek dam when the 50foothigh dike gave way it left 
lowlying areas awash 
in all 25000 acre feet of water rushed through the dike breach 
but the flow had been reduced to a trickle by midday said ronald 
thompson chairman of the washington county water conservancy 
district 
thompson estimated it would take at least six months to design 
and rebuild the dike 
state engineers were inspecting bridges and other highway 
structures in the flood path 
thompson said the dike had a history of seepage dating to when 
the reservoir was filled in 1985 but previous leakage had been 
repaired with little difficulty 
he said new seepage was discovered about 10 am saturday and 
that by 8 pm what had been a small water loss had expanded to a 
major leak heavy equipment was dispatched to reinforce the dike 
but by 1030 pm it became apparent nothing could be done to stop 
the dike from failing and the machinery was pulled out 
authorities said 100 units of an apartment complex sustained 
water and mud damage at the floodings height water was reported 
window high 
overnight local mormon church authorities opened their chapels 
to evacuated families and red cross officials appealed to community 
residents to open their homes to the displaced 
there were no reports of injuries even though there was 
confusion when civil defense sirens blew shortly after midnight 
some residents thought it was a new years celebration not an 
evacuation warning officials said others attending new years 
parties were away from their homes when the evacuation was ordered

sudans prime minister promised political 
change sunday but charged that demonstrators who rioted against 
price increases were struck by madness and seeking illegal 
political gains 
at least four people died apparently all in one khartoum 
shooting incident during four days of street violence last week 
that led to a general strike 
after the strike began thursday the government backed down 
rescinding steep price increases and making salary hikes for 
millions of sudanese retroactive to july 1 
the demonstrators then changed their focus mainly into a protest 
of prime minister sadek mahdis failure to endorse a draft peace 
accord signed nov 16 the protests finally ended saturday 
trade unions and political parties also remain unsatisfied with 
the governments stand they scheduled a meeting with mahdi on 
monday to discuss further economic reforms and peace 
in a nationally broadcast speech marking sudans 33rd anniversary 
of independence from britain and egypt mahdi named no names in his 
bitter attack on demonstration organizers 
some people want to make use of legal differences some who 
have been struck by madness mahdi said at a rally in elobeid 
200 miles southwest of khartoum for them to try and develop these 
differences into an uprising is harmful and wrong 
mahdi promised political changes but didnt specify whether he 
meant economic reforms or stepping up efforts to end the war 
our next steps in the government are holding wide consultations 
and serious responsible studies to review our performance he 
said in the speech broadcast over the official omdurman radio 
the democratic unionist party which negotiated the peace treaty 
with southern rebels has quit the governing coalition party 
leaders said they wanted to express sympathy with the strikers and 
to dramatize their outrage at mahdis handling of the proposed 
agreement to end sudans 5yearold civil war 
the democratic unionists dominate the 2millionmember sudanese 
workers trade union federation which brought the people into the 
streets and called the general strike 
it acted after the government increased prices of essential 
commodities by up to 600 percent and imposed a 15percent 
acrosstheboard sales tax 
government sources said the premier is expected to announce a new 
coalition tuesday with the fundamentalist national islamic front 
replacing the centrist democratic unionists as junior partner to 
mahdis umma party 
in a radio message from the ethiopian capital addis ababa on 
saturday renegade army col john garang the rebel leader 
described the outlook for peace in the new year as bleak but said it 
could have been promising garang blamed mahdis ignoring the 
tentative peace plan for the impasse in the peace process 
rebel leader garang took up arms in 1983 to fight the 
moslemdominated government in khartoum for economic social and 
political changes in the mainly christian and animist south

gerry adams the president of 
the irish republican armys legal political wing sinn fein has 
criticized the guerrilla group for killing civilians in bungled 
bombings 
my view is quite clear i think the onus is on the ira to 
safeguard the civilians from injury and death adams was quoted as 
saying in an interview with sunday life a belfast newspaper 
nineteen civilians have died in a series of botched ira 
operations in the last 14 months 
the outlawed ira prides itself on targeting the security forces 
while sparing civilians in its fight to oust the british from 
northern ireland and the blunders have drawn criticism even from 
some ira supporters 
last july adams called on the ira to get its house in order 
after a bomb exploded prematurely outside a west belfast swimming 
pool killing two of his roman catholic constituents 
in the interview published sunday adams a member of the british 
parliament reiterated his view that the ira must avoid 
circumstances and conditions in which civilians and noncombatants 
will be killed or injured 
i think the onus is always on the ira to do that he said 
the other forces can kill civilians as a matter of policy but the 
ira cannot 
in november 1987 an ira bomb killed 11 protestants attending a 
memorial service to britains war dead in enniskillen 65 miles 
southwest of belfast sparking international condemnation of the ira 
the ira claimed british electronic scanners may have triggered 
the bomb prematurely 
in another admitted blunder a bomb intended to kill a judge 
instead killed a protestant couple and their 6yearold son as they 
drove home from a us vacation last july

president fidel castro vehemently reaffirmed 
his hardline socialist principles sunday in a nationally televised 
speech marking the 30th anniversary of his communist revolution 
today we say with more force than ever socialism or death 
marxismleninism or death castro said 
the speech which carried one of castros strongest declarations 
of ideological purity comes at a time of new challenges in ties 
with the soviet union africa and latin america 
cubas ties with the soviet union appear to have entered a period 
of uncertainty as a result of ideological differences on other 
fronts cuban diplomats say a visit here by pope john paul ii may be 
possible in 1989 and cuba has hinted that it wants a more 
constructive relationship with the united states 
as part of the anniversary celebrations this weekend castro gave 
his speech sunday night in the main square of the eastern coastal 
city of santiago he spoke for almost two hours from the balcony of 
the building where he proclaimed victory for his guerrilla forces on 
new years day 1959 a large crowd gathered to hear him in cespedes 
plaza next to the building which is now used as the city hall 
castro told them he was maintaining strict adherence to socialist 
principles because of the enormous responsibility cuba has to 
the peoples of the third world 
he devoted much of his speech broadcast on staterun television 
however to praising the role played by the people of santiago and 
other eastern cities in his revolution and cubas independence from 
spain in 1902 
the cuban leader considers this city from which he led his 
communist guerrillas into revolution the moral capital of this 
communist country on new years eve 1958 castro ousted a rightist 
dictatorship touching off a revolution that has made him the 
undisputed leader of this sovietallied caribbean nation 
but the cubansoviet friendship although far from breaking up 
seems more tenuous now than it has been in decades 
a key question is whether soviet unhappiness with the way cuba 
has used economic aid from the kremlin estimated at 5 billion 
annually will lead to cutbacks castro has used the economic aid 
to help build his countrys schools and hospitals the soviets say 
and has neglected industrial development 
castro is an advocate of socialist purity and opposes any policy 
that borrows from capitalism he has spoken scornfully of the 
political and social reforms proposed by soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev saying the consequences would be hard for cuba if the 
soviet experiment encounters serious difficulties 
so we may be in for difficulties coming from the enemy camp and 
difficulties coming from the camp of our own friends he said last 
month 
the recent cuban commitment to withdraw its 50000 troops from 
angola by 1991 presents another step toward scaling back cubas 
involvement in international conflicts cuba has given military 
support to many countries but the commitment to angola was by far 
the biggest 
in latin america castro has been aggressively pursuing interests 
common to other countries in the area the evolution of democracy in 
latin america which has been welcomed by the reagan administration 
has also had the ironic side effect of opening diplomatic 
opportunities for castro 
the cuban leader once known for his efforts to promote violent 
revolution now seems more interested in pursuing normal ties with 
elected governments 
castro attended presidential inagurations in ecuador and mexico 
in recent months and may participate in the inauguration of the 
venezuelan president next month 
during castros visit to mexico in late november his first since 
he was exiled there in the 1960s he said he envisions the eventual 
unity of cuba and the rest of latin america 
one day we will make one big giant he said 
western diplomats say castro may be hoping to gain from the 
growing restiveness over the devastating social consequences of 
latin americas 420 billion foreign debt which has left the region 
much poorer than it was a decade ago castro has long advocated that 
latin america renounce its debt on grounds it is unpayable 
meanwhile castro has indicated interest in a more relaxed 
relationship with the united states in remarks to the national 
assembly last week he said he would not neglect any opportunity to 
improve uscuban relations 
a potential obstacle to an accommodation with washington is the 
us plan to beam to cuban audiences a televised version of radio 
marti a station operated by the voice of america whose 
anticommunist programs are already heard in cuba the proposal has 
drawn an angry reaction from castro but he has not said 
specifically how he would retaliate
