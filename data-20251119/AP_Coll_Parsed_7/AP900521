the outcome was left 
hanging monday in a presidential election in which incumbent 
joaquin balaguer was leading by less than 1 percent of the vote 
leftist challenger juan bosch accused conservative balaguer of 
fraud and said sunday that balaguer supporters were paying 40 for 
voterregistration cards in strongholds of boschs dominican 
liberation party 
but some observers believe that bosch 80 a former president 
overthrown by a military coup in 1963 may have lost the election 
through campaign blunders to his 83yearold rival and the 
countrys fivetime president 
after tabulating votes for five days the central electoral 
board said sunday it was suspending further announcements of the 
count on recommendation of former president jimmy carter one of 30 
international observers 
electoral board president froilan tavares made no mention of 
possible fraud saying only that officials found errors by some 
polling stations in compiling tally sheets 
tavares said the count would be suspended pending a review of 
tally sheets in the presence of six international observers a 
laborious process that could take days 
the final bulletin issued by the electoral board on saturday 
gave balaguer an 18227vote lead over bosch but late monday his 
unofficial lead had grown to 21970 votes according to the board 
contacted by the associated press 
with 6645 of the 6663 polling stations reporting or 98 
percent balaguer had 667039 votes and bosch 645069 jose 
francisco pena gomez a former socialist mayor of santo domingo 
was third with 442598 according to the board 
after bosch lost an early lead he accused balaguer of 
colossal fraud and threatened street protests but called off 
the protests friday after the electoral board agreed to review 
tally sheets 
before the election bosch said that balaguers social christian 
reformist party prepared 300000 phony votes to rig the election 
balaguer denied it 
the estimated 40 percent turnout from about 32 registered 
voters was the lowest in more than 25 years 
balaguer has remained out of public view since wednesdays 
elections he was said to be in mourning for his sister laita 85 
who died last week 
carter said friday that no candidate had presented evidence of 
fraud but a review of tally sheets would establish whether fraud 
or honest errors had been committed 
balaguer who is blind with glaucoma appeared to be in trouble 
before the election because of this caribbean island nations 
economic crisis a 2 billion construction project was popular 
among the poor but fueled 50percent inflation 
but bosch confused many dominicans two weeks before the election 
by saying a 1954 agreement with the vatican providing that all army 
chaplains be roman catholic should be shelved in history 
museums 
the statement was widely viewed as antichurch in the 
overwhelmingly catholic nation and seemed to support balaguers 
characterization of bosch as a dangerous marxist 
bosch may also have been hurt by saying he would deport back to 
cuba juan jose arteaga a cuban exile who is balaguers chief 
economic adviser

archbishop rembert weakland says some of the 
reasons women choose to have abortions can be reconciled by the 
church without jeopardizing strict roman catholic teaching against 
abortion 
yes there are possibilities there one could reconcile their 
stance with a church position i think that is a possibility 
thats why you have to talk with each one weakland said in an 
interview published monday by the milwaukee sentinel 
weakland said there are various definitions of prochoice 
opinion ranging from abortion on demand to abortion for specific 
reasons and some personal decisions to have abortions might be 
reconciled by the church but that would be on a casebycase 
basis he emphasized 
i would have to see each one he added i dont know that 
i would want to draw a line each time as if outside this line you 
are not in the catholic church i think that is very dangerous 
weaklands comments came just seven months after the national 
conference of catholic bishops the churchs main governing body 
in the united states issued a statement that no catholic can 
responsibly take a prochoice stand 
because he didnt address specific circumstances it was unclear 
how much weaklands position differed from that of other church 
leaders many catholic theologians have said abortions in some 
cases may be permitted to save the life of the mother 
the milwaukee archbishops statement drew an immediate angry 
response from one antiabortion group that recommended he be 
censured by the vatican 
i think he should stop dialoging and start teaching the 
churchs position and why abortion is always wrong and asks his 
priests to do the same from their pulpits said mary dietrich 
secretary of the milwaukee chapter of wisconsin right to life inc 
but frances kissling national president of the washingtonbased 
prochoice group catholics for a free choice praised weaklands 
statements as a real breakthrough 
i goes much further in acknowledging the political arena than 
any other bishop has done to date ms kissling said it gives 
a lot of hope to catholic politicians who have only been hearing 
criticism 
weakland over the weekend issued a 21page statement on his 
findings on womens view of abortions based on several 
informationgathering meetings he had at churches in his diocese 
earlier this year 
greg bell communications director for the milwaukee 
archdiocese said the archbishop was meeting with priests monday 
and couldnt be interviewed but he said weakland didnt intend to 
work against the churchs antiabortion stand or the statement made 
by his us colleagues in november 
he doesnt want to juxtapose himself against the other 
bishops he said hes not calling for redefinition of church 
teaching what he is calling for is for the church to look more 
closely at the root causes of why women choose abortions 
bell said their may be instances in which weakland believes 
the church could understand why a women would have an abortion 
such as when such a womans life is jeopardized 
in the newspaper interview weakland acknowledged his position 
was a bit aggressive but added he did not fear any reprimand 
from the vatican

the commander of us forces in the 
pacific said tuesday he was optimistic us and philippine 
officials would reach a new agreement providing for continued 
american military presence in the philippines 
last friday american and philippine negotiators agreed to hold 
further talks at an unspecified date on whether to renew a lease on 
clark air base subic bay naval base and four smaller installations 
that expires in september 1991 
rafael alunan spokesman for the philippine panel said the next 
round could begin in three to four weeks 
i am very optimistic that we will reach an agreement with 
continued presence in the philippines adm huntington hardisty 
told reporters after meeting foreign secretary raul manglapus 
chief philippine negotiator in the bases talks 
hardisty also said philippine proposals for joint usfilipino 
use of the bases was very feasible the six bases are nominally 
under philippine command but effectively run by the americans 
the united states maintains about 40000 troops defense 
department civilians and military dependents in the philippines 
asked whether the united states would accept a reduced presence 
under a new agreement hardisty said i think well have a 
reduced presence worldwide because of whats happening in europe 
and whats happening worldwide with our defense budget but i also 
think well maintain our forward presence 
on monday hardisty met with president corazon aquino and 
discussed the strategic relationship 
from my personal opinion i think our government feels very 
comfortable with the recent exploratory talks hardisty said 
after the meeting i think both agree that our future depends on 
a new relationship a new strategic relationship 
hardisty was in manila to attend a regular meeting of the 
usphilippine mutual defense board 
after five days of talks last week both sides agreed to 
continue discussions despite differences including manilas claim 
that washington has failed to honor previous commitments on the 
bases 
mrs aquino refuses to say whether she will support a new 
agreement opposition to the bases is growing because many 
filipinos view them as an infringement on national sovereignty 
on may 13 on the eve of the talks communist rebels opposed to 
the bases killed two us airmen near clark air base 
on monday philippine police said the rebels also had planned to 
assassinate senior us military officers but the plots were foiled 
when police began searching suspected rebel hideouts for the 
killers of the two servicemen 
on friday the pentagon announced american diplomats and service 
members in the philippines would receive hazardous duty pay because 
of the communist threat 
on tuesday police defused bombs outside the headquarters of two 
banks in the financial district in manila officials said the bombs 
could have destroyed both buildings had they exploded 
in another incident assailants hurled three grenades at two 
branches of the security branch and trust co one of the banks 
where the bombs were found there were no injuries and only minor 
damage in the attacks police said 
police said they did not know who was responsible for the bombs 
but the explosives were the same kind used by military mutineers in 
decembers coup attempt

college campus and a populated neighborhood on monday and 10 people 
were killed and 34 wounded officials said 
authorities clamped an indefinite curfew in two districts where 
the clashes broke out and ordered police to shoot violators 
at least 46 people have been killed and hundreds wounded in 
shootings since may 15 authorities said 
no group has claimed responsibility for the latest wave of 
violence in hyderabad a city of 3 million in southern sind 
province but police blame a renegade faction of a militant indian 
immigrant party the mojahir qami movement 
supporters of the group which represents moslem immigrants from 
india who entered pakistan after the 1947 partition of the 
subcontinent are demanding recognition as a fifth nationality 
along with the baluch sindis pathans and punjabis

movement opened fire on police trying to search the house of a 
member of the group supporters of the group opened fire from their 
houses and rooftops and the battle lasted for nearly two hours

that incident or if there were additional scattered clashes 
in the capital of islamabad opposition parties said bhuttos 
17monthold government has failed to restore lawandorder to her 
home province and asked president ghulam ishaq khan to declare a

in the heart of america a team of book experts is on a special 
mission sifting through millions of dollars of treasures trying 
to write the final chapter in a mystery some feared never would be 
solved 
their task is painstaking their work daunting to pore over 
about 28000 books and papers some rare and priceless others 
ordinary and worthless determine which are stolen then match 
them with their owners 
their work stems from the fbis largestever seizure of stolen 
rare books and manuscripts a cache valued at up to 40 million 
all recovered this spring from one mans house in iowa 
while these library experts are figuring out what belongs to 
whom a bigger question looms how 
it would be interesting to know how somebody like this can go 
into library after library amassing so many books and it took so 
long to put an end to this said william moffett president of 
the association of college and research libraries 
stephen carrie blumberg 41 who is undergoing psychiatric tests 
at a missouri prison hospital after being charged with theft has a 
long history of emotional problems and scrapes with the law over 
the years authorities have nabbed him with piles of books found 
him snooping in libraries tracked and arrested him 
but this is more than the tale of a troubled man 
its the story of how difficult it is to protect some of 
americas cultural heritage how hardnosed cops know little about 
the cloistered work of rare books and how someone purportedly took 
advantage of both weaknesses 
this man apparently was quite brilliant said gary menges 
head of the university of washingtons special collections and 
preservation and chairman of the library associations rare books 
security committee 
he knows the system he knows the way things work said 
peter briscoe collection development officer at the university of 
californiariverside where blumberg was arrested in 1988 
libraries have done more and more to make things secure blumberg 
seemed to be one step ahead 
an attorney who has known blumberg and his family for years 
disagrees 
hes being portrayed as a master thief said john daubney a 
st paul minn lawyer representing blumberg in a case in that 
state this kid is totally incapable of doing this physically 
mentally or otherwise theres no question he apparently had some 
books improperly taken but the great bulk of them were 
purchased through legitimate means 
he was more of a buyer than a seller he was a collector 
said daubney noting that blumberg had an annual income of more 
than 70000 from family trusts 
blumberg who has spent time in psychiatric hospitals is a 
softspoken loner who travels to flea markets in an old truck and 
wears old clothes daubney said 
hes fascinated by stained glass windows and door knobs and once 
bought an old minneapolis mansion selling it at a 100000 profit 
the attorney added 
the kid is not stupid by any stretch daubney said he 
just thinks differently than the rest of us 
blumbergs legal troubles date back more than 20 years said 
steve huntsberry a corporal with the washington state university 
police who has tracked him as part of an investigation of rare book 
thefts at the school 
blumbergs record includes a 1967 charge of stealing antique 
doorknobs in iowa and a 1974 accusation of theft in colorado after 
his car was found stuffed with books huntsberry said the latter 
case was dropped 
in 1988 blumberg who used the alias of matt mcgue was fined 
and placed on probation after pleading guilty to trespassing and 
possessing burglary tools in the closed rarebooks section at 
californiariverside authorities say 
i knew he would get caught again somewhere huntsberry said 
i just thought he would skate through it 
but on march 20 authorities raided blumbergs house in ottumwa 
iowa carting off 19 tons of books and papers in one 40foot van 
and a load of antiques in another 
dozens of library experts including an eightmember team from a 
group called online computer library center which has a database 
of 21 million titles are helping the fbi identify and catalogue 
the books and manuscripts which are warehoused in an office 
building in omaha neb 
this is unprecedented in the book world to get that much 
attention from the authorities said jake chernofsky editor and 
publisher of ab bookmans weekly a publication for antiquarian 
book dealers 
the inventory should be computerized within four weeks said w 
dennis aiken assistant special agent in charge of the fbis omaha 
office 
when we first got into this we thought it would be an 
overwhelming impossible task he said very quickly through 
the outpouring of cooperation from the public and private literary 
sector its becoming a very manageable task 
aiken said tricks were played to conceal book owners during the 
raid a trunk of bookplates library cards and other identification 
data was found 
while some books are worthless one is valued at 70000 to 
90000 aiken said the fbi said one expert estimated all the 
volumes and papers could be worth up to 40 million 
authorities say they have found a bible from 1480 and three 
shelves of priceless materials from 14501500 an era known as the 
incunabula a period following the invention of the gutenberg press 
it was apparent that they had been chosen with great care 
david schoonover university of iowa rare books curator said of 
the nine rooms of floortoceiling books he surveyed at blumbergs 
home 
aiken said that while the books and manuscripts come from 140 
universities the bulk are from about 10 schools some libraries 
he added had no idea materials were missing 
other valuables also were seized in minnesota where blumberg 
was born and lived authorities searched three places in 
minneapolis and st paul taking more than 300 stained glass 
windows gold coins jewelry silverware door knobs antiques and 
other items 
police plan to show the public a videotape of them this week for 
identification purposes 
daubney however said he has provided the fbi with more than 
5000 receipts often nothing more than little scraps ofpaper 
including some for stained glass windows and gold coins 
the blumberg case some say illustrates both the problems of 
protecting rare books and investigating these thefts 
experts say rare book libraries have a delicate balancing act 
making collections accessible yet secure 
and police are novices in the area 
its not the average street creep were dealing with said 
sgt richard hansen of the eugene ore police who investigated 
the loss of 662500 worth of material including 9000 to 11000 
manuscripts believed to have been taken from the university of 
oregon library in 1987 
we dont have a network of contacts its absolutely fish 
out of water hansen said i had no idea of whos reliable 
whos not 
the librarians helping piece together the puzzle will make the 
telling difference aiken said 
we would not be able to do that without their expertise he 
said my career would be over before this got done

despite a new civility campaign that implores 
cmon new york ease up the inhabitants continue to hog pay 
phones fight over cabs curse jersey drivers and bump elbow knee 
and shove each other 
courtesy you got the wrong town man said thomas abato as 
he tossed some change in the general direction of a newspaper 
vendor 
in a city where courtesy often seems limited to the its our 
pleasure to serve you message on the blue and white cardboard 
coffee containers selling people on civility is the ultimate 
marketing challenge says ron burkhardt whose advertising firm 
is trying to do just that 
the courtesy campaign is directed by a group called new york 
pride which held a news conference thursday to unveil an 
advertising campaign 
the city is in trouble in crisis its aching now said 
cochairman herb rickman sounding as if maybe he should ease up 
himself government alone cant save this city 
new york has become a rough tough place to live in he 
added largely because of little incidents little irritations 
in the subway or on the street partly as a result he said 
tourism is down and residents and corporations are moving out 
the campaign attracted international attention when it was 
announced at another news conference 2 months ago but until this 
week little had actually been done to promote civility 
the campaign includes 
television spots showing typical new york scenes women 
fighting over a taxi cab men sticking fingers in each others 
chests a bicyclist brushing past a pedestrian as the soundtrack 
plays the song try a little tenderness at the end two men 
lift a fallen woman from the street 
radio spots in which a grumpy bank teller tells a customer to 
get in line asked which line he barks see that short one 
over there thats not it 
print ads featuring a large close up of a cab drivers snarling 
face and the message its about time we changed the face of new 
york 
posters and window stickers with the quasitrapazoidal new 
york prde logo and the promise courtesy shown here 
a telephone line 800happyny for reports of politeness or 
courtesy you can call up and find out whos being courteous and 
who isnt said mark simone of wnew radio who is focusing on the 
topic on his program 
a supermarket chain is giving free merchandise to any customer 
who is not thanked by a check out cashier a cab company is 
training all its drivers in etiquette and diamond district 
merchants are displaying the courtesy posters in their store 
windows 
on friday however new yorkers were up to their old habits 
they grumbled when they arrived at the central park tennis house 
at 7 am to discover the courts would not open on time because it 
had rained the night before 
they grumbled at dozens of subway stations along the j and m 
lines after a shooting on a train halted service during rush hour 
they grumbled at the corner of lexington avenue and 60th street 
where pedestrian traffic was halted briefly when a blind man hooked 
his cane through a womans shopping bag prompting some nasty 
language by the latter 
new yorkers are cynical said emery jackson president of we 
care about new york an agency which coordinates volunteers i 
dont blame new york pride for trying but i dont think public 
service announcements will inspire them to be less curt 
spokesmen for public service agencies were asked if the civility 
campaign in having any effect 
how could i possibly gauge such a thing asked a harried al 
oleary spokesman for the transit authority who had a big meeting 
friday morning get real babe i gotta go 
people have been in a bad mood because of all the rain said 
vito turso spokesman for the sanitation department try us next

more than 200 scientists asked the chinese 
government monday to allow dissidents fang lizhi and his wife li 
shuxian to leave china and threatened to boycott scientific 
conferences there until the human rights activists were free to 
emigrate 
the scientists led by soviet physicist yuri orlov also urged 
the us government to put more pressure on china to permit the 
fangs to leave their refuge at the american embassy without threat 
of arrest 
the chinese government accused fang an astrophysicist and human 
rights activist of inciting the may 1989 prodemocracy 
demonstrations in beijings tiananmen square he and li also a 
scientist fled to the us embassy 
the two have refused to sign an admission of guilt for 
responsibility for the demonstrations which ended in a bloody 
crackdown and martial law 
we should try to push the opportunistic and insensitive us 
administration in the right direction orlov told a news 
conference 
president bush must decide by june 3 whether to extend most 
favored nation trading status to china the administration is under 
pressure from congressional democrats and human rights activists to 
deny the trading preference because of chinas crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrations last year 
officials who asked not to be identified said monday bush had 
decided to extend the favored trade status for another year 
the appeal includes petitions signed by 224 prominent 
scientists including several nobel laureates to the chinese 
government through its academy of sciences and to secretary of 
state james a baker iii urging freedom for fang and li 
as scientists dedicated to the truth and free inquiry we 
cannot remain silent while our colleagues in the peoples republic 
of china are held captive because of their pursuit of these 
ideals the petitions said 
the scientists also said they would encourage boycotts of 
scientific conferences in china until the fangs are released aryeh 
neier executive director of human rights watch said 11 such 
conferences were scheduled between may and september in china 
robert l park chairman of the american physical society said 
discussions for new scientific conferences will not take place as 
martial law persists and peaceful dissent is suppressed

university said he has been in touch with his parents by mail 
they have a good spirit the kind of spirit chinese people have 
especially of their generation he said

radio aahs uses a unicorn for its logo and 
its allchildrens format is almost as rare as that mythical beast 
but backers hope it will lead to a national network of 
childoriented radio stations and others say the market is ripe 
for such programming 
radio can be the storyteller that too often is missing from a 
childs life it makes you think said peggy charren president 
of action for childrens television a vigorous promoter of 
childrens radio programming 
wwtcam or radio aahs pronounced oz made its debut may 12 
with a broadcast from st pauls como zoo so far wwtc is the only 
station in the childrens radio network 
two other radio networks for children are breaking ground in 
orlando fla and philadelphia 
radio aahs airs educational songs school news fairy tales 
historical stories and recreations of such oldtime radio shows as 
the lone ranger around the clock 
its pretty nice said 5yearold gary petersen i dont 
like rock n roll stations my mom turns it up too loud 
his mother patricia is glad gary and his 3yearold brother 
jarrod feel a part of things mom has her radio station dad has 
his radio station and now they have theirs she said 
emily semsch 6 likes that the station has more kid songs 
theres a song from school i know 
william osewalt president of childrens radio network believes 
that engaging the community is the key to the commercial ventures 
success hes thinking of children as guest djs broadcast 
performances by school choirs and bands and radio plays junior 
journalists could also report on activities in their schools 
there also will be the ones who go out and interview the 
herschel walkers other vikings the governor and the senators and 
find out how legislation will affect them osewalt said 
osewalt formed childrens radio network in 1984 selling 
programming to six stations around the country before getting out 
of the business in 1986 for personal reasons 
when he was ready to resume he targeted the twin cities among 
the reasons are its high percapita spending on education and its 
reputation as a traditional family base he said 
like they say in show biz if it doesnt work here it wont 
work anywhere osewalt said 
the station has started with about 20 fulltime employees plus 
volunteer advisers such as st paul school superintendent david 
bennett 
osewalt would not disclose the networks budget 
radio aahs is a very nice alternative in a childs media 
diet said richard weinberg director of the university of 
minnesotas institute of child development in the college of 
education our kids live so much in a visual world returning to 
an auditory world allows them to enhance their own imaginations 
in florida kids choice broadcasting network has begun 
marketing its network of satellitedelivered programs orlando 
station wprdam is the flagship station for the network having 
launched the childrens format march 31 
kidwaves radio network of philadelphia plans to launch its 
allchildrens programming june 1 at kidzam in kansas city mo 
said network president mel diamond 
i think for the first time radio people are just waking up to 
this segment diamond said our goal here at this network is to 
raise their imagination levels their creativity and to ensure we 
have a literate america 
the notion of an allchildrens format on radio tantalizes l 
roger casty executive vice president of cpm inc a chicago media 
management company that finds media for advertisers and agencies 
it sounds like a wonderful idea if i were the advertiser i 
would certainly look into it it may be a very efficient way to 
go casty said

a 29yearold eritrean battle for independence 
from ethiopia has become the longest war in africa and one of the 
worlds most obscure fought in a region where travel is difficult 
and dangerous an associated press correspondent spent nine days in 
eritrea this is his report

just south of this neat town built of 
rock and adobe are towers of sandstone boulders hundreds of feet 
high where the people take cover during daylight in case of 
bombing raids 
we cannot stay down there during the day said mariam 
teglest 32 a soldiers widow with three children it is much 
too dangerous when the planes fly 
she was speaking of sovietbuilt mig fighterbombers of the 
ethiopian air force which had bombed the town of about 20000 
people twice in a few months 
afabet is one of a dozen or so major towns in eritrea 
ethiopias northernmost province where rebels have fought for 
independence since 1961 rebel forces captured the town in 
february early in their biggest offensive of the war 
the conflict began 29 years ago as a small uprising by scattered 
guerrilla bands and has grown into a toetotoe slugging match by 
armies of thousands of soldiers armed with heavy artillery tanks 
and other modern weapons 
it is a war the eritreans appear on the verge of winning 
despite the ethiopian militarys total dominance of the sky and its 
vast superiority in manpower the government has a military force 
of about 320000 men largest in black africa 
the eritreans do not divulge the size of their army the 
international institute for strategic studies in london says 
30000 but some recent visitors to the region believe the true 
strength is double that or more 
in three decades the war has touched almost every part of this 
barren mountainous province the size of england 
afabet is tucked into a desert valley that evokes the american 
southwest here and elsewhere people hide by day and work by night 
in caves or camouflaged stone buildings and under the spreading 
branches of the ubiquitous african thorn tree 
weve created the worlds largest underground economy said 
haile menkerios a harvardeducated economist grinning at his play 
on words he is on the central committee of the rebel eritrea 
peoples liberation front 
weve learned not to expose ourselves he said with a sweep 
of the arm that covered hills dotted with cave mouths and stone 
huts almost undiscernible from a few yards 
eighty miles north of afabet is orota the main rebel base camp 
it sprawls through a deep narrow valley crosshatched by canyons 
and surrounded by rugged peaks so high the sun reaches in for only 
a few hours a day 
enemy planes fly into this maze at great peril 
orota is a supply and military training base site of a 
detention center for thousands of prisoners of war a civilian and 
an army hospital schools for children of soldiers manufacturing 
plants and repair shops for trucks tanks and other military 
vehicles 
the hospitals stretch for three miles down the main valley to 
reduce the threat from bombing wards and operating theaters are 
hidden in tents under thorn trees in caves and in nearly invisible 
buildings hewn from the same sandstone as the surrounding mountains 
i think frank lloyd wright would be proud of us said 
menkerios grinning again at his reference to the architect who 
believed buildings should harmonize with their natural surroundings 
a pharmaceutical factory hidden in caves makes everything from 
saline solutions to malaria pills and sanitary pads for women 
one in four rebel soldiers is a woman many of them commanders 
in an army with no ranks or sex discrimination 
everything in orota is powered by electrical generators most of 
which are cranked up only after sundown when the vast camp stirs 
to life 
sovietmade field telephones captured from the ethiopians 
connect the scattered complex they look like early edison models 
but they work 
nearly everything is captured scavenged donated or handmade by 
a people used to getting by on next to nothing this province on 
the red sea is one of the poorest in one of the worlds poorest 
nations 
nothing is thrown away artillery shell casings filled with sand 
and welded together form the supporting pillars of a new school 
disposable hypodermic syringes become light switches old tractor 
and truck tires are turned into wash troughs 
the eritreans claim that they do not have the support of foreign 
governments and that all their military hardware from tanks to 
kalashnikov assault rifles has been captured from the ethiopian 
army 
officials and some diplomats in addis ababa ethiopias capital 
say the eritreans have received arms and money from several arab 
countries around the red sea that oppose the sovietsupplied 
government of president mengistu haile mariam eritreas population 
is split about 5050 between moslems and christians 
a few reporters allowed behind rebel lines in recent months saw 
nothing but old and often battered sovietmade military equipment 
nothing in orota except the crowded hospitals suggests the huge 
battles being waged around asmara the eritrean capital a 16hour 
drive south over rutted trails even experienced drivers can lose in 
the dark 
on a roughly northsouth line running nearly 100 miles betweem 
asmara and the sea the rebels are fighting more than a third of 
ethiopias armed forces mostly conscripted and poorly trained 
young men 
at the beginning of their february offensive the rebels 
surrounded and cut off asmara including an estimated 1 million 
civilians and the governments 120000man 2nd revolutionary army 
three times since early april the 2nd army pushed eastward in 
an attempt to recapture its nearest outlet to safety the red sea 
port of massawa each time an eritrean force no more than half the 
size stopped it cold 
reporters who visited massawa in late april could hear the 
thunder of artillery and tank barrages day and night at the front 
40 miles away the fierce exchanges often made windows rattle 
the rebels claim they killed wounded or captured 30000 
ethiopian soldiers when they took massawa in a threeday battle in 
early february and have inflicted similar casualties along the 
ghinda front 
journalists who have seen the remains of massawa been guided 
near the front by the rebels and talked with deserters from 
mengistus army believe the numbers are not greatly exaggerated 
whatever the number of dead and wounded on either side the 
ethiopian 2nd armys inability to break out of asmara illustrates 
the rebels military prowess 
most of mengistus other forces are occupied far to the south in 
the neighboring provinces of tigre wollo and gonder with an 
uprising by the smaller tigre peoples liberation front 
the tigreans known to coordinate military moves with the 
eritreans have spent 15 years fighting to overthrow mengistu and 
establish a new national government 
eritrean fighters and their leaders predict the long war will 
end in a few months 
come back soon said asmellash abraha who was detached from 
other duties to play host to three visting journalists ill show 
you asmara i am anxious to see it myself its been a long long 
time since i was last there

president mengistu haile mariam 
who built a marxist regime on the ashes of a feudal empire he 
helped bring down in 1974 is a man with many problems and some 
predict a limited future 
his army has suffered battlefield setbacks in recent months 
particularly in the northernmost province of eritrea where rebels 
appear on the verge of winning a 29yearold war for independence 
another insurgent group swept out of its stronghold in tigre 
province just south of eritrea 10 months ago and has pressed its 
fight to overthrow mengistus government to within 50 miles of the 
capital 
the soviet union preoccupied with its own economic and 
political problems has threatened to close the tap that has poured 
billions of dollars worth of military hardware into ethiopia since 
1977 
mengistu spurned the united states and its western allies when 
he achieved power 13 years ago and they are in no hurry to improve 
relations 
major elements of mengistus own army attempted a coup last 
year he said in a recent speech he had survived nine assassination 
attempts 
with all those problems and burdened by a collapsing economy 
that has never been robust mengistu signaled a change of course 
two months ago from now on ethiopia will favor freemarket 
economics and welcome foreign investment he said 
giant posters of marx and lenin came down in addis ababa but 
those showing mengistu in various poses as a revered leader remain 
it looks like a deathbed conversion a western diplomat in 
addis ababa said on condition of anonymity if you believe that 
mengistu has had a true change of heart you probably also believe 
in the easter bunny 
mengistu joined other army officers in 1974 when he was a 
major in overthrowing emperor haile selassie three years later 
he reigned supreme 
he created the marxistleninist workers party of ethiopia in 
1984 in 1987 mengistu established the peoples democratic 
republic of ethiopia formally dropping his military rank of 
lieutenant colonel to become a civilian president 
ethiopia is ruled by a small group agreeable to mengistus every 
plan according to the memoirs of dawit wolde giorgis a former 
member of the party central committee who defected to the west 
dawit major human rights groups and other critics accuse 
mengistu of ordering or participating in the executions of dozens 
of rivals and of imprisoning thousands mengistu has denied the 
claims

peace talks aimed at ending nearly three 
decades of war between eritrean rebels and the ethiopian government 
are stalled and unlikely to resume 
preliminary discussions with former president jimmy carter as 
chairman began in atlanta last september and moved to nairobi the 
capital of kenya two months later 
negotiations in nairobi ended with the government and rebel 
delegations clearly at odds but agreeing to continue talks under 
the joint mediation of carter and julius nyerere former president 
of tanzania 
a third round was tentatively scheduled for early march in 
nairobi but foundered on a dispute over whether the united nations 
should send an observer 
eritrean rebels see un participation as de facto recognition 
of their movement which controls 80 percent of the eritrean 
countryside president mengistu haile mariams government opposes 
it for the same reason 
carter invited the united nations to take part on behalf of the 
rebels and said his offer was rejected 
rebel leaders said the invitation should have been sent jointly 
by them and the representatives of mengistus government and 
accused carter of doubledealing which the former president denied 
the issue will ultimately go to the united nations ali 
sayed abdalla foreign minister of the eritrean peoples liberation 
front said in an interview the un must guarantee any accord 
so why not agree to have it represented as an observer at the peace 
talks 
a western diplomat in addis ababa ethiopias capital said i 
see absolutely no chance for a resumption the military situation 
has changed radically since september and the government seems to 
be reeling i suspect the eplf feels it can stand pat on its 
demands

india is moving tens of thousands of 
battleready soldiers to its border with pakistan prompting fear 
among western diplomats of another war over kashmir 
western military experts say india also is seeking to buy large 
quantities of movable bridges troop transport boats and other 
equipment that could be used in an attack 
in addition the government recently formed a paramilitary unit 
called the national rifles which could undertake counterinsurgency 
operations in the troubled state of jammukashmir freeing the army 
to go to the border 
interviews with military experts from the west and asia 
indicated several countries were seriously considering the 
possibility of war between india and pakistan one western officer 
said his embassy was discussing contingency plans for withdraal of 
embassy personnel and their families 
a month ago many of the same officers said war was impossible 
weve changed our assessment a highranking western officer 
said we think there now is a 5050 chance 
experts say the developments are doubly disturbing because both 
countries are believed to possess nuclear weapons technology india 
exploded a nuclear device in 1974 
both also have mediumrange missiles 
the focus of the problem is jammukashmir the only indian state 
with a moslem majority 
both nations claim the scenic region of valleys and himalayan 
mountains and have fought two wars over it since winning 
independence from britain in 1947 
nearly 400 people have been killed in jammukashmir since the 
indian government began a crackdown on moslem separatists jan 20 
india accuses pakistan of arming the insurgents and training 
them in camps across the border pakistan claims to provide only 
moral support 
western military officers said several developments contributed 
to their changed attitude about the possibility of war 
rhetoric has grown hotter on both sides 
in april prime minister vp singh of india told his countrymen 
to be psychologically prepared for war rightwing groups in 
india have called for limited military strikes into pakistan 
pakistans prime minister benazir bhutto has told the kashmiri 
separatists your blood is our blood 
both countries especially india appear to be backing up their 
words with action 
india has undertaken a slow but steady buildup of forces 
along its entire border with pakistan military experts say 
in the last month the 57th and 8th divisions totaling about 
20000 men were moved from the northeast frontier with china to 
kashmir according to two western experts like the others they 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
military officers said india would not have shifted troops from 
one sensitive region to another without an express purpose 
india lost a war with china in 1962 although tensions have 
eased between the countries new delhi still regards beijing as a 
threat 
western experts say deployment of the paramilitary national 
rifles commanded by an army lieutenant general will allow army 
troops in the kashmir valley take positions along the border both 
in kashmir and farther south 
they say india is strengthening its border forces in rajasthan 
and punjab states on the flat plain that stretches into the heart 
of pakistan 
the pakistanis appear to have done less actual preparation for 
war but have put border regions on alert the western experts say 
they found it highly disturbing that pakistan had followed 
regularly scheduled battlefield exercises with another series 
during the next few months the experts said they believe india 
will try to seal the kashmir front to prevent moslem militants from 
sneaking through the high mountain passes when the snow melts 
they will crack down hard in the valley during the hot 
summer and the rainy season one officer said 
if the separatist struggle continues in september western 
officers say india might be tempted to launch an air strike at the 
alleged training camps in pakistan 
they said india probably would seek to maintain the status quo 
in kashmir against pakistani retaliation and attack on the ground 
from rajasthan or punjab 
indias goal would be to seize as much territory as possible 
before negotiations began they said 
a governmentfinanced think tank has come out in favor of 
limited strikes against pakistan 
the institute for defense studies and analyses citing western 
precedents said in its latest paper india has every right to 
retaliate against the bases of terrorism and the country that 
sponsors the terrorism 
but one good sign for peace is that many in the indian military 
do not appear to want a war 
the army has just finished a difficult 30month peacekeeping 
operation in sri lanka where it lost more than 1100 men to 
attacks by tamil guerrillas indian officers have been quoted as 
saying their economically strapped nation cannot afford a war 
which would cost an estimated 47 million a day

worth of clothes to the movie without approval and made script 
changes without telling the director 
medawar said in the may 20 issue of people magazine that ms 
collins also turned down jacqueline bisset and annmargret as 
potential costars because she wanted to be the biggest name in 
the movie 
the actress agent irving swifty lazar confirmed that the 
project has been shelved but told the magazine that it wasnt 
joans fault she wasnt greedy the producers defaulted on her 
300000 salary 
theyre amateurs and they never came up with the money

to give a commencement speech at louisiana state university 
i was nervous at first and then i kind of got relaxed she 
said they were normal people just like me 
she said reagan told her the scrapbooks would be a valuable 
contribution to his library now under construction in california 
id like to have him have them in his library said miss 
marler but i worked on this for nine years so i dont want to 
just give them up 
miss marler said reagan his interest piqued by the stories and 
photographs in the scrapbooks talked at length about the attempt 
on his life in 1981 
he talked about how the bullet entered him when he got to the 
hospital he could hardly walk his suit was brand new and they

in south florida money can buy the weaponry of 
your choice whether its antiaircraft missiles plastic 
explosives or drone bombers authorities say 
the region is considered one of the worlds bestequipped 
bazaars for blackmarket weapons of war a rendezvous where 
guerrilla groups narcoterrorists and other underworld elements 
seek ever more sophisticated firepower 
colombias drug cartels their jungle cocaine labs and 
clandestine airstrips under assault from fighter bombers and 
helicopter gunships appear to be the latest big shoppers for 
shoulderborne stinger antiaircraft missiles 
in an undercover operation may 5 a narcoterrorism task force 
based in miami arrested two colombians allegedly seeking to buy 120 
stingers and 50 automatic rifles for pablo escobar gaviria kingpin 
of the medellin cocaine cartel 
the defendants remain jailed without bond no trial date has 
been set 
it was the first acknowledged coup for the task force which was 
formed in september from 14 federal state and county law 
enforcement agencies 
the reasons given for the miami areas role in the arms trade 
include its proximity to latin americas drug network the vast 
amounts of latin wealth in miami banks and available for use and 
the regions busy seaports and airports which make it easier for 
criminals to move unnoticed 
firearms customers come from all quarters 
authorities suspect the irish republican army not a regular 
customer in the region was in the market for a stinger in west 
palm beach in january 
authorities here also have investigated purchases of a pilotless 
drone bomber antitank tow missiles rockets and plastic 
explosives 
south florida is on the national scale and internationally 
seen as a tremendous gateway for munitions thats just an accepted 
fact said customs spokesman michael sheehan 
here its just a matter of money really in general if you 
have the money you can buy pretty much what you want every 
type of evil deed that you want to do you can do here 
william gavin agent in charge of the fbi in miami said its 
difficult to gauge how many such transactions are going on 
the enforcement response includes operation exodus a customs 
program begun in 1981 to target illegal exports of hightech 
equipment and munitions 
with the activities and the crackdown by the government of 
colombia certainly the interest in heavy weaponry military type 
has increased said bob creighton head of the miami office of 
the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms they are interested 
in highquality firepower 
hampshire college professor michael klare an expert on the arms 
trade says that while law enforcement efforts to stem arms dealing 
are more vigorous in the united states than in many other 
countries the issue gets low priority 
the main priority for our customs offices is preventing entry 
into the united states of drugs and understandably this has become 
the national priority klare said but it means there isnt the 
resources and personnel to work on watching the egress from this 
country of weapons 
since drug smuggling requires a roundtrip for the transporters 
the return leg is open for innovation 
everybody talks about these planes and trucks coming in 
because we worry about the contraband klare said nobody asks 
what they do when they leave we just assume they leave empty the 
fact is that they are carrying out weapons on many occasions and 
we just dont make it a priority

help mr wizard a dripping onepound 
amphibian with a soaring soul beat back a challenge by a trio of 
african goliath frogs to win the 1990 jumping frog jubilee on 
sunday 
wizard owned by gregg jaschek of concord calif leaped 19 
feet 3 inches besting 72 other finalists in the 62nd annual event 
that drew a capacity crowd of 8000 to this calaveras county hamlet 
it was just luck ive been trying for 19 years and if i knew 
the secret of winning i would have won long before this jaschek 
said kissing his frog as friends poured champagne on him 
three african goliaths owned by seattle wash animal 
collector andy koffman fizzled in the colorful event 
disqualified because they couldnt fit on the starting pad or 
simply couldnt jump far enough but after the meet koffman 
declared ill be back 
jaschek an automotive parts clerk who took home the 500 
firstplace prize said he captured help mr wizard in the san 
joaquin valley 
i wasnt afraid of the african frogs he said i saw them 
on tv they werent so hot 
second place went to an 18foot 4inch leap by a frog named cho 
cho and third place was won by jumpin jack 
two of the huge frogs dubbed goliaths won the right to 
compete in the finals but the best of their leaps in qualifying 
rounds fell far short of the world record koffmans goliaths get 
as big as 15 pounds but the contestants sunday weighed in at an 
estimated three pounds each 
the big frogs entry has been the focus of the buildup for the 
colorful contest inspired by mark twains gold rush era short 
story about a frog that failed to jump because its belly was filled 
with shot media reports about the giant foreign challengers 
swelled attendance 
before the meet koffman who keeps the frogs in a 1500gallon 
tank in his basement had predicted his frogs would easily shatter 
the contest record that is held by onepound rosie the ribiter 
who in 1985 covered 21 feet 5 inches in the three hops allowed by 
contest rules 
on saturday koffman said one of his jumpers hoppy leaped a 
record 21 feet 9 inches which he videotaped but it was outside 
competition 
he blamed their lackluster showing on the difficulty of 
squeezing them onto the 9inchdiameter starting pad they just 
kind of slip out of my hands and it slows them down he said 
the big frogs also leaped at an angle and made little stutter 
hops after landing keeping down their distance under contest 
rules the distance is measured as the total of three successive 
hops 
in one early qualifying event an african goliath frog named 
johnny carson jumped 12 feet 4 inches enough to win the round 
for the international association of fairs round but only 4 
inches farther than the runnerup ohio hopper 
another koffman frog named sue decisively won the media jump 
with a leap of 13 feet 5 inches while a third african frog jay 
leno finished fifth in the western association of fairs jump 
there was some controversy with detractors claiming the huge 
frogs from cameroon had an unfair advantage over local amphibians 
other local frog jump boosters welcomed the burly outsiders and 
the attention they brought 
the big frogs are listed on californias dangerous animals 
register and required special exemptions to be allowed into the 
state

a moslem secessionist movement in 
indias troubled state of jammukashmir has become a mixed blessing 
for prime minister benazir bhutto of neighboring pakistan 
it has enabled her to brighten her image at home and silence a 
hostile opposition but it could backfire after todays legislative 
elections in azad free kashmir pakistans part of the disputed 
territory 
if ms bhuttos leftofcenter pakistan peoples party wins 
analysts say she will be faced either with arming the kashmiris 
who cross the border demanding military help or dealing with 
opposition protests 
she will have to agree to a limited war to pacify kashmiris or 
have no control over kashmir said abdul shaheen an official in 
the azad kashmir government 
india and pakistan have fought three wars two of them over 
kashmir and there are reports of preparations for another 
the main opponent of ms bhuttos party in pakistani kashmir is 
the all azad kashmir moslem conference a rightwing religious 
party that controls the 48seat state assembly 
militant secessionists in indianheld kashmir have been waving 
the islamic banner and moslem fundamentalists in pakistan have 
pressed for the government to act but the prime minister has 
refused jammukashmir is the only state with a moslem majority in 
india which is overwhelmingly hindu 
although ms bhutto has not taken a personal hand in the azad 
kashmir election the pakistan peoples party has gained a rich 
islamic flavor from her current tour of iran syria turkey jordan 
north yemen tunisia egypt and libya all are members of the 
organization of islamic conference 
two weeks ago political observers in this tranquil mountain 
city of 300000 would not have given her party a chance now one 
said theyre definitely in the running 
the pakistan peoples party has no seats in the state assembly 
because it boycotted the 1985 elections to protest the military 
regime of president mohammed zia ulhaq 
abdul qayyum president of azad kashmir and leader of the moslem 
conference party was a close ally of zia who died in a plane 
crash in august 1988 mrs bhuttos party won the democratic 
election held later that year and she became the first woman to 
lead a modern moslem nation 
abroad ms bhutto appeared a heroine who restored democracy to 
her developing nation 
but many at home saw her as a weak leader paralyzed by 
compromise incompetence and corruption that perception began 
changing in january after india cracked down on moslem separatists 
in jammukashmir nearly 400 people have been killed 
ms bhutto aimed biting impassioned rhetoric at india saying 
saying to the kashmiri separatists at one point your blood is 
our blood her promises of 1000 years of war for what she 
calls moslem freedom fighters preempted the political 
opposition 
pakistan and india fought wars over kashmir in 1948 and 1965 
and went to war a third time in 1971 over east pakistan which 
became bangladesh as a result 
kashmir a former princely state was divided between the two 
countries in 1947 when the subcontinent was partitioned and they 
became independent of britain 
india has accused pakistan of arming training and harboring the 
jammukashmir separatists pakistan denies the allegations but says 
it supports the right of kashmiris to selfdetermination 
the rhetoric has subsided in recent weeks but skirmishes occur 
periodically along the unmonitored truce line where soldiers of 
the two nations face each other 
azad kashmir has a special status in pakistan with its own 
constitution president and prime minister the central 
governments jurisdiction is limited to foreign policy defense and 
currency 
todays state election will the third since independence 
justice ashraf khan chief election commissioner said 235 
candidates were contesting 40 assembly seats most as independents 
none are women although there are no restrictions on female 
candidates 
the remaining eight seats will be filled by the new assembly and 
divided among women refugees and expatriates

a fire broke out in a laboratory of nobel 
prizewinning scientists at a medical school sunday night forcing 
evacuations and releasing some hazardous material authorities said 
initial reports that radioactive substances were released at the 
university of texas southwestern medical center turned out to be 
false said chief mike zak of the dallas fire department although 
such materials are used in the lab 
zak said radioactive materials were used in the lab but werent 
released when the fire began shortly after 8 pm 
twelve firefighters were taken to an adjacent hospital for 
observation in a precautionary measure because they may have been 
exposed to the hazardous chemical hydrazine 
firefighters extinguished the fire on the fifth floor of the 
medical center an hour after it started zak said several people 
were evacuated 
fire officials said the blaze originated in one of several labs 
run by michael s brown and joseph l goldstein who won the 1985 
nobel prize in medicine for discoveries related to cholesterol 
metabolism and cholesterolrelated diseases 
the blaze released undetermined amounts of hydrazine a 
corrosive and flammable compound that can be fatal if inhaled 
ingested or absorbed through skin zak said

few colleges or universities are taking all the steps experts 
believe are needed to stamp out campus racism 
many schools have established committees to address bigotry 
others have offered special scholarships and stepped up recruiting 
of minority students and faculty still others are requiring 
students to take courses about racism or minority issues or attend 
orientation sessions on race relations 
but a spot check of schools around the country by the associated 
press found only a handful taking the comprehensive approach 
experts feel is necessary to quell the recent rise in campus 
bigotry 
my greatest criticism of these efforts is that although they 
are often genuine they tend to be piecemeal not comprehensive in 
many instances campuses that have racial incidents rush to do 
something immediately to fill a gap said reginald wilson senior 
scholar at the american council on education and an authority on 
campus race relations 
he and others said the fault often lies at the top with 
college presidents who fail to take the lead in combating racism or 
even recognize it as a serious problem 
it has to start from the top with policy statements that 
racism and the other isms wont be tolerated said barry 
beckham a former english professor at hampton university in 
virginia who started a bimonthly national newsletter this year 
the black student advisor 
about onequarter of the nations college presidents consider 
racism a problem on their campus according to a study published 
last month by the carnegie foundation for the advancement of 
teaching too many campuses have sought to sidestep rather than 
confront the issue that report concluded 
administrators at the university of texasaustin came in for 
criticism last month when two fraternities painted racial epithets 
on a car and sold tshirts with a sambo caricature 
i am embarrassed to be associated with an institution that 
hasnt addressed the issue more strongly that it has womens 
basketball coach jody conradt said 
the university of oregon in eugene last year strengthened its 
student conduct code prohibiting racial harassment it also 
required students to take a course in race or gender studies 
but andy clark a black senior who is student body president 
said courses hes taken on black women writers black power in the 
civil rights movement and race class and ethnic groups in the 
united states were all taught by whites 
earlier this month university of washington president william 
gerberding made remarks at a banquet disparaging to a mexicanborn 
student gerberding apologized and agreed to take a racial 
sensitivity course 
black student union president michelle gordon called the seattle 
campus very racist the tension is real high here 
at indiana uiversity assistant dean of students pamela freeman 
said several committees formed to deal with racism have helped ease 
tensions on campus but last year the offices of the universitys 
president thomas ehrlich who is jewish and michael gordon the 
dean of student affairs who is black were spraypainted with 
antisemitic and antiblack slogans 
on the other hand aces wilson and others praise university of 
michigan president james j duderstadt for taking effective and 
wideranging actions to improve relations at one of the nations 
more racially torn campuses 
duderstadt named a vice provost for minority affairs invested 
nearly 4 million in the center for afroamerican and african 
studies and boosted the budget for attracting minority faculty 
duderstadt has also developed a michigan mandate a yearly 
blueprint for increasing campus diversity 
next fall for the first time the school will offer an 
interdisciplinary course on racism 
the result minority enrollment is up 256 percent since 1987 
and the school has hired 76 additional minority faculty members 
applications by black students for next falls freshman class 
increased 26 percent 
other colleges battling racism have met resistance 
university of wisconsin officials say they have fewer racial 
incidents with the help of a 3yearold plan called design for 
diversity providing for the recruitment and retention of 
minority faculty and students as well as mentor programs for 
minorities 
but the school has run afoul of the american civil liberties 
union for adopting a rule prohibiting comments epithets or other 
expressive behavior directed at an individual if it demeans the 
persons race sex religion color creed disability sexual 
orientation national origin ancestry or age or creates a hostile 
environment on campus 
some white students at the university of texas felt unfairly 
targeted at campus demonstrations last month 
as a heterosexual white male i feel like theres going to be 
a rally against me out here even though i personally have not done 
anything said mark bunger 
a columnist for vanderbilt universitys student paper sparked a 
war of words in march by calling the schools minority recruitment 
efforts reverse discrimination and accusing the campus black 
cultural center of perpetuating racism 
while some students may wish that some special programs were 
not in place vanderbilt has established diversity as a goal 
vanderbilt provost charles kiesler said

the first photo series from the hubble 
space telescope was supposed to be just an engineering test but it 
surprised scientists by revealing an unsuspected double star 
hubbles inaugural photo sequence taken from its orbit 381 
miles above the earth showed bright crisp stars against a black 
background with much clearer images than seen in a picture taken 
by a groundbased telescope of the same part of the heavens 
fantastic james westphal the principal scientist for the 
camera used in the first photo exercise said sunday we are just 
as pleased as punch at this point our image is significantly 
better than we were concerned that it might be 
westphal said the hubble pictures clearly show that an image 
which appeared in groundbased photos to be only a single star was 
in fact a rare binary star the space telescope pictures showed 
two overlapping points of light instead of a single blob as seen 
in a picture taken by a chilean observatory 
we didnt know it was a double star said westphal 
nasa officials had said hubbles initial images would be only 
an engineering test that was being used to meet the ceremonial 
requirements for the first light pictures that are traditional 
for a new telescope 
but a delighted westphal said the pictures were worthy of 
serious study 
boy we could get lots of science out of this right now he 
said 
lennard fisk the associate administrator for science at nasa 
said the quality of the pictures proved the design and testing of 
the costly telescope 
im delighted he said its two times better than we 
thought it would be 
the quality of the photos brought cheers from national 
aeronautics and space administration engineers who have had to 
solve a series of problems with the telescope since it was launched 
last month by a space shuttle 
hubbles troubles have included a fouled antenna a computer 
program that caused instruments to shut down another computer 
program that contained a math error that affected pointing 
accuracy and a satellite jitter that experts still find 
troublesome 
jean olivier deputy project manager for the hubble said that 
the first light pictures are only a coarsefocused image of 
what the space telescope eventually will achieve he said there 
still are weeks remaining in an elaborate focusing checkout of the 
instruments 
were only about a fourth of the way through the whole 
focusing process he said 
the planned scientific studies will not start until the 
engineers have completed the checkout which may take months 
eventually hubble is expected to produce pictures seven times 
clearer than the images captured on sunday 
engineers started the first light sequence before noon 
sunday by sending programmed instructions to hubble 
the telescope satellite moved to point directly at the target 
stars then a wideangle camera opened its shutter for a onesecond 
exposure and then for a 30second exposure the images from the 
camera were recorded on board as 10 million bits of data at 149 
pm the data were sent through a relay satellite to computers at 
the goddard space flight center 
while a crowd of engineers scientists and journalists watched 
on television hubble engineers processed the data through a 
computer that assembled a photo 
at first the raw images showed a mass of streaks and white dots 
against a field of gray but the picture became sharper and sharper 
as a computer removed stray signals and then brightened the points 
of light 
eventually the picture was narrowed to a small segment of the 
sky it showed the bright double star along with eight other bright 
stars 
a photo taken by the las capanas observatory in chile of the 
same area of the sky was able to capture only four bright stars and 
the double star was blurred into a single image 
the target for hubbles first image was a star cluster called 
theta carina a group of objects about 1260 lightyears from 
earth the target star field is visible from earth only in the 
southern hemisphere 
hubble by working from an orbit above the obscuring effects of 
the earths atmosphere is able to look at stars with 10 times the 
clarity of the views achieved by ground telescopes 
nasa engineers believe that eventually the space telescope will 
be able to photograph stars that are 25 times fainter than the 
dimmest object visible from earth and see stars that may be up to 
14 billion lightyears from earth

after the kremlin embargoed shipments 
of oil and gas to secessionist lithuania factory director jouri 
sivicki had to lay off 60 workers 
then we found a way to change our energy supply from gas to 
electricity and we took the workers back sivicki said sitting 
behind the wide desk in his paneled office at the zhalgris 
machinetool plant 
his commonsense response to the soviet blockade is typical in 
this baltic republic which declared independence march 11 
residents of the capital and its suburbs interviewed last week 
said they had plenty of food but were running out of gasoline 
an estimated 12000 people are unemployed because of the energy 
shortage vytautas landsbergis president of lithuania has said 
more factories will close soon 
the city did not meet its payday for teachers last week said a 
teacher who would identify herself only as natasha 
vytautas morkunas waiting in line to buy laundry detergent with 
ration coupons said of course it was easier before but i 
support independence 
other rationed goods include gasoline flour macaroni and sugar 
motorists have tried crossing into the neighboring republic of 
byelorussia to buy gasoline but police stationed at the pumps 
forbid sales to cars with lithuanian license plates except those 
driven by soviet military officers 
many russian residents of lithuania are angry 
people arent buying my tomatoes said olga avyorka a 
russian who has a sidewalk stand im not for independence 
overall however reaction to the embargo has been not to panic 
but rather to learn to cope 
a talk with sivicki the factory manager suggests why moscow 
finds little support in this nation of 36 million people which 
the soviet union forcibly annexed in 1940 along with neighboring 
latvia and estonia 
on paper sivicki should be one of the people soviet officials 
hoped would oppose independence he is an ethnic pole a member of 
a 7 percent minority in lithuania that the kremlin says will suffer 
if the republic secedes 
although sivicki thinks lithuania has moved too fast he 
supports independence and wants only to make sure lithuanians do 
not form an exclusive national elite 
about 80 percent of the population is ethnic lithuanian a 
higher ratio of native population than in the two other baltic 
republics in latvia the figure is 51 percent and in estonia about 
63 percent 
the zhalgris factory one of lithuanias largest has 1300 
employees about 30 percent are ethnic poles 30 percent 
byelorussian 25 percent russian and 15 percent lithuanian 
sivicki belongs to the lithuanian communist party faction loyal 
to moscow but he believes in private ownership and thinks the 
sovietowned factory should be leased and eventually sold to its 
employees 
under private ownership we would produce more he said 
many people interviewed said they were fed up with soviet rule 
vilnius where many buildings date from the 16th and 17th 
centuries has the gritty rundown unpainted look of many cities 
in eastern europe 
things have always been bad said rolandas cepulis a 
butcher of course i support independence how can you even ask 
weve lived like this for 50 years how can it get any worse 
but his stateowned shop has meat summer is approaching and 
stores are full of food more varied and plentiful than in moscow 
and many other russian cities 
vendors crowd the farmers market many travel from the southern 
republics of azerbaijan and georgia with oranges tomatoes and 
other produce 
the strains are showing however and some residents are taking 
unpaid vacations 
birute chekuolene a heart surgeon stopped work early in may 
because her hospital ran out of oxygen filters which are purchased 
abroad 
soviet officials can try to strangle the lithuanian economy and 
have sent soldiers to occupy some city buildings but lithuanians 
feel they already have seen the worst of what the kremlin can offer 
in the grounds of the 17th century sts peter and paul church on 
a hill near the city center leonore jonciene knelt in prayer at a 
small chapel built last year to honor the thousands of lithuanians 
exiled to siberia by josef stalin in the 1940s 
ms jonciene then 27 was exiled with her parents in 1949 to a 
fishing village on lake baikal their crime was owning seven acres 
of land which made them big landowners and class enemies of 
the soviet government 
ten years in siberia did not embitter her against russians who 
lived in the same village of olkhonsky and did the same work 
it did harden her against soviet power however i am ready to 
support independence no matter what even if i go to prison she 
said

los angeles lagged behind other big cities in 
federal narcotics charges when robert bonner now president bushs 
choice to head the drug enforcement administration was us 
attorney there court records show 
although the city regularly was near the top in the nation in 
federal drug arrests it ranked far lower in the percentage of 
federal defendants charged with drug offenses during bonners 
tenure 
throughout the period the most common federal criminal charges 
in the nation were drugrelated but in los angeles the most common 
were fraud and embezzlement according to a recent analysis of 
court records by a syracuse university research group 
the study shows that bonners office brought a smaller 
percentage of drug charges than the national average for us 
attorneys furthermore he lagged behind a number of colleagues in 
big cities that had fewer drug arrests to begin with 
from the beginning of 1984 through the first half of 1987 19 
percent of federal criminal defendants in los angeles faced 
narcotics charges federal prosecutors nationwide charged 27 
percent of their defendants with drug counts during those years 
the researchers found in response to a request by the associated 
press last week 
the percentage of defendants charged with fraud and embezzlement 
in los angeles in those years ranged from 20 to 29 
bonner who is awaiting senate action on his nomination 
declined to be interviewed about his work in los angeles he has 
been praised by drug agents for pursuing criminal charges in the 
1985 kidnapping and murder in mexico of dea agent enrique kiki 
camarena 
but by early this year drug crime was so rampant in los angeles 
itself that the city was one of five areas designated by national 
drug policy chief william bennett for extra federal aid 
in 1986 the deas los angeles office ranked third in the nation 
in drug arrests with 452 behind only new york with 1066 and miami 
with 861 according to dea spokesman joe keefe 
by 1989 bennett noted dea had 1033 major drug investigations 
under way in los angeles again behind only new york and miami 
bonner 48 was us attorney in los angeles from early 1984 
until mid1989 when he became a us district judge there bush 
nominated him for the dea post may 11 justice department spokesman 
david runkel praised his extraordinary experience in drug 
investigations 
the information about bonners record as a prosecutor was 
contained in a broader study by the nonprofit transactional records 
access clearinghouse at syracuse using records from the federal 
judicial center a branch of the us courts 
this research is among the first made public comparing the work 
of us attorneys the justice department also has similar 
information but rarely discloses it 
the syracuse study was completed and sent to attorney general 
dick thornburgh last october long before bonner was picked for the 
drug post 
the research originally covered 19801987 last week at the 
request of the associated press coauthors david burnham and 
margaret hanus defleur calculated the averages for the portion of 
those years in which bonner was chief prosecutor 
last year bonners former chief assistant prosecutor gary 
fees said that the office had a heavy caseload of military 
purchasing fraud and savings and loan fraud both efforts which he 
said had high priority from the justice department neither area 
however commanded the money manpower or new legislation that 
justice devoted to the fight against drugs 
asked about the study justice spokeswoman deborah burstionwade 
said mr bonner is well respected by his peers and did an 
outstanding job for the attorney general and the department were 
certain that he will make an excellent head for dea once he is 
confirmed she said she was not in a position to comment on the 
specific numbers 
the study also looked at the percentage of federal defendants 
charged with drug counts in 10 other us attorney offices 
all 10 had higher percentages of drug defendants during the four 
years than los angeles which had 19 percent 
they were baltimore 36 percent boston 33 percent brooklyn 
ny 44 percent manhattan ny 43 percent chicago 20 percent 
detroit 34 percent hartford conn 40 percent newark nj 29 
percent philadelphia 33 percent and san francisco 21 percent 
asked about the study last october the justice departments 
executive office of us attorneys released its own data for 1988 
showing that los angeles percentage that year was 26 
justices 1988 data showed four of the 10 areas ranked ahead of 
los angeles brooklyn with 52 percent manhattan 48 detroit 39 
and baltimore 37 
hartford chicago boston and philadelphia had 25 percent 
newark 23 percent and san francisco 18 percent 
bonner boosted by thornburgh for a judgeship and now the dea 
post has pursued some policies reminiscent of thornburghs 
early on as a prosecutor bonner unsuccessfully tried to take 
control of the departments independent organized crime strike 
force in los angeles thornburgh lost a similar battle as us 
attorney in pittsburgh in the early 1970s 
last year when thornburgh renewed that reorganization effort as 
attorney general his aides recruited bonner to sing the praises of 
the idea to reporters

people are laughing yes laughing at the 
sight of a plump 63yearold grandmother being mocked night after 
night as this gross watry pumpkin this whale a bag of 
flax a puffd man old cold witherd and of intolerable 
entrails 
dont feel sorry for pat carroll she has only herself to blame 
for her humiliation and she loves every minute of it 
miss carroll a veteran stage screen and tv actress and 
comedian is believed to be the first female performer ever to play 
sir john falstaff the leering sackswilling old windbag in the 
merry wives of windsor 
eight times a week at the shakespeare theater at the folger 
miss carroll spends 45 grueling minutes acquiring jowls side 
whiskers mustache beetle brows and wispy gray thatch then she 
struggles into the baggiest britches this side of barnum amp bailey 
miss carroll began preparing for falstaff ironically by losing 
30 pounds on a liquid diet and opting for extra padding around her 
belly 
i knew this would be a very strenuous role and i suffer from 
far too much weight she said munching on a juicy red apple 
during an interview 
she shuddered at the thought of climbing those stairs and 
chasing mistress ford around the stage all night and she 
sympathized with the two lackeys who haul falstaff away in a 
laundry basket to help him escape the wrath of a jealous husband 
i simply did not want to be responsible for bad backs and 
hernias miss carroll said 
although she has a naturally low voice made hoarse by age 
cigarettes and her roaring irish laughter miss carroll practiced 
voice and breathing exercises to achieve a deeper more masculine 
tone 
she took walking lessons from kabuki theater director tadashi 
suzuki who makes his actors practice in bare feet 
my walk is a combination of bad feet sore knees 20 pounds of 
costume and thinking of jackie gleason she said because 
jackie even at his heaviest had a kind of lightness about him he 
used his hands very delicately like a surgeon and his feet were 
always twinkling i used him as my mental image of a male body that 
was protuberanceheavy but still able to dance 
with the help of the folgers male actors miss carroll overcame 
her feminine impulse to greet them with motherly hugs and learned 
instead to express male camaraderie with pokes punches and 
slaps on the fanny 
she took the time for some furtive research on facial hair and 
what men do with it 
at restaurants i would sit casually and look at gentlemen with 
mustaches or beards she said some are twirlers some are 
fluffers some are strokers and some are pinchers i have a 
suspicion theyre worried about food crumbs and such sticking in 
that hair 
miss carroll has been lusting after the falstaff role since the 
early 1960s when she saw her first merry wives at the royal 
shakespeare theater in stratford england but she had a long wait 
she starred in broadway shows and films did tv comedy routines 
with sid caesar and danny thomas appeared as celebrity guest on 
whats my line and password quiz shows and won cheers for 
her onewoman show as gertrude stein her last credit was the voice 
for the animated squidwitch ursula in disneys oscarwinning the 
little mermaid 
she finally made her shakespeare debut at the folger in 1986 as 
the nurse in romeo and juliet which won her a helen hayes 
award for best supporting actress michael kahn the folgers 
artistic director asked what shed like to do next and she made 
her pitch for falstaff 
kahn laughed but thought about it two years later when the 
folger called about casting for merry wives she was dead 
serious after seeing her in fake whiskers he bought the idea 
it was a divine role that i wanted to play she said and 
a brilliant artistic director gave me the rope to hang myself 
not to worry miss carroll the show which runs at the folger 
through july 1 opened with rave reviews and the audiences are 
howling suspended disbelief is epidemic 
miss carrolls only lingering apprehension concerns her 
mustache which must endure falstaffs frequent quaffs from a 
tankard 
i perspire so profusely and i drink an awful lot of water 
onstage she said i have nightmares about losing half my 
mustache id look like a very pudgy hitler

congress may be getting a little fed up with a 
3yearold law giving the farmers home administration a free hand 
in forgiving some big debts including about 100 of 1 million or 
more 
bills in both the house and senate would clamp a lid on the 
amount of bad debt that fmha could excuse and would tighten some 
other loopholes in the agencys farm lending program 
the free hand was provided by congress itself in the 
agricultural credit act of 1987 which was aimed at streamlining 
and liberalizing debtcollection policies of fmha an agriculture 
department agency 
by last nov 30 the most recent tabulation available almost 
16000 delinquent farm loans totaling nearly 28 billion had been 
forgiven by fmha under the 1987 law 
those include writedowns writeoffs and other settlements of 
old debts some going back a decade or more 
the forgiveness of all or part of the debt owed to fmha was 
authorized by congress on grounds that in many cases the assets 
currently held by borrowers are worth far less than the face value 
of the original loans 
land values a mainstay for farm credit plummeted in the 1980s 
wiping out much of the previous net worth of borrowers and reducing 
loan collateral 
in many cases a fmha borrower could not be expected to regain 
enough cash flow to repay the old loans so a solution has been to 
write down the debt to the current value of the collateral 
another practice has been to let borrowers buy out their 
loans at current liquidation values 
by whatever method the fmha as of nov 30 had written off 
nearly onethird of the 88 billion in overdue loans 
last week the senate agriculture committee approved a 1990 farm 
bill provision aimed at fmha credit policies including a 350000 
lid on debt forgiveness 
a similar measure in the house would impose a 250000 limit on 
the fmha practice 
the administration wants the credit loopholes plugged and the 
agriculture department says it favors a 250000 lid on fmha loan 
forgiveness 
roland r vautour usda undersecretary for small community and 
rural development told congress earlier this year that huge 
amounts are being forgiven because there is no dollar limit in the 
law 
vautour who oversees fmha operations said the average of all 
loan writedowns was 172857 and that the average writeoff was 
205674 per loan 
most borrowers would be unaffected if the maximum amount that 
could be forgiven were set at 250000 he said 
according to fmha figures as of nov 30 more than 4600 loans 
were written down 7965 million as vautour testified that was an 
average reduction of 172857 each 
there were more than 5000 loans completely written off for more 
than 103 billion an average of 205674 each also more than 
6300 old loans totaling more than 933 million were stricken from 
fmha books as uncollectible 
the fmha has its roots in the great depression of the 1930s and 
traditionally has been the governments farm lender of last resort 
only those who cant get credit elsewhere need apply 
even without the writeoffs and other forgiveness features the 
agency would be operating at a loss 
vautour said fmha estimated the cost of debt restructuring under 
the 1987 law alone will total more than 8 billion 
when you add interest subsidies writeoffs not attributable 
to the 1987 law and other expenses we are looking at overall 
losses in our farm programs of something more than 22 billion over 
the next several years he testified 
some critics including agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
maintain that fmha has effectively departed from being a credit 
agency and has operated grant programs in recent years 
when yeutter announced the bush administrations proposals for 
the 1990 farm bill on feb 6 he was asked about fmha programs 
weve gone a long way from its original purpose of being a 
source of credit of last resort for farmers and youve got a whole 
variety of ways that have made it very nearly a grant program in 
many of its attributes yeutter said the result of that is 
that it has cost the department and the american taxpayer a great 
deal of money 
yeutter said fmha has had immense losses through the years 
and it just seems to us that in a time of budget austerity we 
cannot afford to run that program in the same manner anymore

three giant african frogs touted as 
potential recordbreakers were big flops at the jumping frog 
jubilee beat out by a puny domestic onepounder named help mr 
wizard 
i wasnt afraid of the african frogs said gregg jaschek 
who took home the 500 first prize sunday i saw them on tv they 
werent so hot 
some veterans of the annual calaveras county competition had 
complained the giants from cameroon had an unfair advantage but 
organizers voted in march to let seattle animal collector andy 
koffman bring on his burly outsiders 
three of koffmans goliaths made it to the finals but he 
couldnt get a decent leap out of the threepounders they were too 
big to fit on the 9inch starting pad and were disqualified or 
slipped and slid their way to lackluster hops 
a dripping help mr wizard soared 19 feet 3 inches in three 
jumps to best 72 other finalists 
ill be back declared koffman who had claimed his frogs 
could leap 30 feet in a single bound 
the 62nd annual jubilee 150 miles east of san francisco drew a 
capacity crowd of 8000 thanks to the controversy over koffmans 
frogs the event was inspired by mark twains short story the 
celebrated jumping frog of calaveras county about a frog that 
couldnt jump because its belly had been filled with lead shot 
jaschek an auto parts clerk from concord said he captured help 
mr wizard in the san joaquin valley its win was just luck he 
said 
ive been trying for 19 years and if i knew the secret of 
winning i would have won long before this he said kissing his 
frog as friends poured champagne on him 
second place went to an 18foot 4inch leap in three jumps by a 
frog named cho cho third place was won by jumpin jack 
koffman brought 27 goliaths to the frog jump the big frogs can 
weigh up to 15 pounds and range up to three feet in length his 
three finalists johnny carson jay leno and sue weighed in at 
about three pounds each 
the average domestic frog weighs about a pound and is about 
eight inches long 
koffman was done in by a rule that frogs must have all four feet 
on the pad the big frogs also leaped at an angle and made little 
stutter hops after landing under the rules the distance jumped is 
the total of three successive hops 
they just kind of slip out of my hands and it slows them 
down koffman said im really disappointed 
before the meet koffman who keeps the frogs in a 1500gallon 
tank in his basement predicted they would easily shatter the 
record held by onepound rosie the ribiter who jumped 21 feet 5 
inches in three leaps in 1985 
in one qualifying event johnny carson jumped 12 feet 4 
inches enough to win the round sue won its round with a leap of 
13 feet 5 inches jay leno finished fifth on its way to the finals 
the big frogs are on californias dangerous animals list and 
needed exemptions to be brought into the state koffman had to 
promise to keep the sharptoothed frogs away from domestic animals 
i think mark twain is up there right now looking down and 
laughing jubilee official buck king said in march at the height 
of the controversy

it was a sight never before seen by the press 
corps that follows president bush the president was actually 
sitting down during a golf match 
but there he was in the middle of the doug sanders celebrity 
proam golf tournament seated on the green not just once but on 
two different holes 
bush who puts as much emphasis on golfing speed as he does on 
precision was forced to cool his heels while the tournament 
leader lee trevino finished his much more contemplative play just 
ahead of bushs foursome 
it was definitely a change of pace for the president to play in 
a tournament instead of a wideopen course where everyone allows 
him to blast through 
its different thats for sure bush said chatting briefly 
with reporters while waiting for trevino to finish the 13th hole at 
the deerwood country club outside houston 
known for his hyperkinetic energy and pace bush generally races 
through 18 holes without pausing for longer than it takes to wipe 
his brow 
his record was under two hours at the cape arundel golf course 
last summer near his vacation home in kennebunkport maine 
one aide has dubbed his playing style as aerobic golf 
sundays 18 holes in sweltering heat and humidity took him 4 
hours 
bush was joined by his oldest son texan george w bush who 
also is no slouch at fast play 
but the president didnt seem to mind waiting especially since 
it gave him a chance to savor the adulation of thousands of people 
lining the links and cheering him on 
bush whose golfing tends to be a bit uneven was ebullient when 
he hit a good shot downcast when he flubbed one at one point he 
used his club to help fish one of his sons errant shots out of the 
water 
at another point he demonstrated how to pick up his golf cap 
from the ground with a club

while congress and the bush administration 
hold urgent talks on deficit reduction house members are deluging 
constituents with taxpayerfinanced mail in an election year 
the house has been getting its nose tweaked by the senate over 
the stream of newsletters and town meeting notices that are an 
incumbents best friend 
it goes without saying that taxpayers will likely be 
outraged to learn the house may exceed its 407 million mail 
budget by 38 million sens harry reid dnev and don nickles 
rokla wrote to a house committee chairman last month 
last week the cost overrun was projected by lawmakers at 44 
million 
the senate meanwhile is expected to have a 6 million 
surplus in its 237 million mail budget the two senators wrote 
to rep frank annunzio dill reid is chairman and nickles the 
ranking republican on the appropriations subcommittee on the 
legislative branch annunzio is chairman of the house 
administration committee 
why the difference in mail costs the senate has imposed rules 
on itself to hold down the mail expense the house agreed to some 
changes last year but didnt go as far 
rep vic fazio dcalif chairman of the house appropriations 
legislative branch subcommittee said he wouldnt support overall 
restrictions in mass mailings but would listen to suggestions on 
setting limits for individual members 
he accused the senate of transferring money from other accounts 
into the mail account in an election year 
fazios criticism only underscores the bitterness lingering from 
the senates insistence last year that the house curb its mail 
costs 
the senate requires each member to disclose his mail costs 
mailings are prohibited once a senators money allotment is 
exhausted although the rules committee can switch funds from 
another senator who failed to use his full amount senators are 
given allotments based on a states population 
during last years battle over mail costs the senate persuaded 
the house to agree to separate accounts for each chamber the 
number of house newsletter mailings was reduced from six to three 
but the house still lacks individual disclosure and can keep on 
mailing after the budgeted money is exhausted the house can pass a 
supplemental appropriation to reimburse the postal service or make 
that agency absorb the costs either way the mail gets delivered 
fazio last week won tentative support from senators to let the 
house use 25 million in unspent funds to make up a portion of the 
postage deficit 
reid said hes encouraged by fazios willingness to discuss 
individual accounting and disclosure for house members 
thats the key a step in the right direction reid said 
but he also expressed a willingness to do battle again adding 
were going try to get the mail monster under control 
the postal service said senators sent out 454 million pieces of 
mail at a cost of 69 million in the first half of fiscal 1990 
over a year the projections based on historical trends are 1156 
million pieces and 177 million in cost 
the postal service show the house spent 32 million to send 
2125 million pieces of mail in the first half of fiscal 1990 
which began oct 1 projected over a full year the figures would 
be 5327 million pieces and 789 million in expenditures 
two prominent house republicans minority leader bob michel of 
illinois and bill frenzel of minnesota have introduced bills aimed 
at further limiting the number of town meeting and newsletter 
mailings establishing separate accounts for each house member and 
public disclosure 
both plan to try to add their proposals to the appropriation 
bill for running congress 
at the moment there has been no sign of help from the 
majority house democratic leadership frenzel said the frank is 
a very powerful influence in elections i dont think the democrats 
are going to let loose of it without some great pressure being 
applied 
frenzel who is retiring said the mail cost could be a good 
political issue for republicans but quickly added there are a 
number of republicans who regard the franking perk as zealously as 
democrats

politics lobbying and public opinion polls 
drive congress agenda but sometimes another motivation comes into 
play personal tragedy 
such is the case with two house bills debated this month one 
on family leave policy and the other aimed at expanding the rights 
of the disabled 
republican rep marge roukema of new jersey has spent a decade 
in the house racking up a probusiness voting record but on the 
issue of whether the government should give employees the right to 
unpaid leave for family medical emergencies she and the business 
lobby part ways 
roukema was the prime republican sponsor of the bill which 
passed the house earlier this month she scolded those especially 
business groups who went the other way 
the organized business lobby in washington is out of step with 
the real world and that includes conscientious nononsense 
bottomline business people at the grass roots she said the 
lobbyists have overreacted in a way that no one can explain to me 
for mrs roukema the need to take unpaid leave from work to 
care for a new child or a critically ill relative relates directly 
to her own suffering 
these are not abstract problems she told the house in an 
emotional speech i know ive been there 
she recalled that when she started raising a family her son was 
stricken with fatal leukemia he needed home care i was free to 
remain at home and give him the loving care he needed but today 
many households dont have the luxury of one spouse making enough 
money so the other can quit work 
i continually asked myself during this process what would i 
have done if i not only had the tragedy and the trauma of caring 
for my child but also had to worry about losing a job and a roof 
over my head she said 
many years later mrs roukema found an answer in the parental 
leave bill 
this week the house expected to complete action on the 
americans with disabilities act one of the main forces in getting 
that legislation moving is no longer in the house but he came back 
last week for the start of the debate 
former house majority whip tony coelho resigned from the house 
last year to avoid an inquiry into his personal finances but his 
support for the bill has nothing to do with money coelho has 
epilepsy 
if i were not epileptic i probably wouldnt have the real 
passion in disabilities issues that i do coelho said i know 
what its like to be discriminated against 
for most in congress you dont think about these folks 
because you arent disabled he said they he said 
referring to the people in wheelchairs who sat outside the house 
chamber during the debate they dont have a pac political 
action committee and they dont understand the political process 
when he left congress last year coelho said he told speaker 
thomas foley that he didnt intend to come back as a lobbyist as so 
many of his colleagues have but i made one exception for the 
rest of my life i would lobby on disability legislation he said 
there was plenty of lobbying on both the parental leave bill and 
the disabilities act but the stories behind the legislation added 
poignancy missing from debates on the budget or foreign aid 
they also helped tip the scales toward passage 
the roukema and coelho tragedies not to mention others recalled 
in the debates make it extraordinarily tough for lawmakers to make 
a dispassionate choice congress can be a very intimate place and 
the peer pressure can be so enormous that voting no is not an 
acceptable option 
of course much of what congress does is based to some degree on 
personal experiences of the members such as the former farmer who 
might get on the agriculture committee to write farm laws 
other lawmakers experiences may be translated into legislation 
of a less magnanimous nature such as a provision in a tax bill to 
help out the family business or a government project for a 
developer friend back home

contra commanders say they have 
stopped disarming and will not tell their troops to give up their 
guns unless the government offers more safety guarantees 
demobilized fighters are not getting the treatment they 
deserve said oscar sovalbarro the secondranking contra 
commander in an interview with the associated press 
sovalbarro known as commander ruben said the demobilized 
contras were being harassed by the sandinistas and werent getting 
enough food medical care and assistance to establish themselves in 
civilian life 
his statements saturday followed a meeting with government 
disarmament coordinator roberto ferrey according to a presidential 
communique ferrey told the contra high command the government 
remains steadfast in its commitment to give you all the guarantees 
and security measures you require 
in the communique president violeta barrios de chamorro called 
on the nicaraguan people to support the demobilized and disarmed 
that have been integrated into civilian life in order to 
contribute to the pacification of the country 
the usbacked contras fought the leftist sandinistas for nine 
years in a civil war that claimed 30000 lives when mrs 
chamorros ussupported administration took over from the 
sandinistas after february elections the rebels agreed to disarm 
by june 10 
but so far only 1084 out of an estimated 11000 fighters have 
put aside their weapons according to the latest government figures 
sovalbarro blamed the delay on the sandinistas who he said were 
subverting mrs chamorros reconciliation efforts 
the government is sympathetic but it doesnt have any money 
and the sandinistas are disobeying orders he said 
he cited a sixday civil service strike last week which 
virtually paralyzed the government as an example the public 
employees union is controlled by the sandinistas 
the sandinistas claim the contras stalling is a pretext for 
attracting us aid 
sovalbarro spoke for the contra high command gathered at el 
almendro a village 110 miles southeast of managua in the center of 
one of five security zones where contra fighters agreed to lay down 
their arms 
high command leaders from whom rebels take their orders chose 
to hold forth in el almendro because they feel it is safer than 
other security zones where they fear they might be surrounded by 
the military 
el almendro is set in a sparsely populated ranching area where 
support for the rebels is strong the nearest sandinista troops 
spotted by reporters were 25 miles up a dirt road to the north 
sovalbarro said that the june 10 disarmament deadline could 
still be met if there was an atmosphere of confidence 
he said the sandinistas would have to stop their war of 
insults against the contras and would also have to stop trying 
to destabilize the government 
he cited what he considered examples of sandinista harassment 
two demobilized fighters beaten by sandinista militants in masaya 
another fighters body found along a road he said one former 
fighter had returned to camp complaining of harassment 
ferrey had said saturday that the contras would continue 
disarming despite the high commands decision 
but sovalbarro said that simply meant individual contras 
wouldnt be stopped if they wanted to leave he said that had 
always been the case the contras are volunteers and anyone can 
leave any time 
but as leaders we cannot tell our fighters to demobilize 
until there is a guarantee that they will be left in peace 
sovalbarro said 
fighters interviewed by the ap said they would not disband 
without orders the sandinistas are doing things that arent good 
for us said a rebel who called himself bengala the bengal 
he said he had been fighting for six years

other peoples smoke is a proven cause of heart 
disease in nonsmokers raising their risk of dying from the 
disease by up to 30 percent a study says 
in a presentation in boston at the world conference on lung 
health stanton glantz of the university of california san 
francisco said research is beginning to show exactly how cigarette 
smoke alters the heart blood and arteries he presented a study in 
which he reviewed others research on the subject 
in 1986 the surgeon general concluded in his annual report on 
smoking and health that socalled passive smoking causes lung 
cancer in nonsmokers at that time the evidence was insufficient 
to link passive smoking with heart disease the report said 
newer studies have changed that glantz said friday in a 
telephone interview 
the evidence that passive smoking causes heart disease is 
stronger today than the evidence was in 1986 that passive smoking 
caused lung cancer glantz said 
glantzs report comes one week after the environmental 
protection agency said it will soon declare environmental tobacco 
smoke a known carcinogen 
the epa concluded that passive smoking causes 3000 deaths 
glantz said passive smoking also causes 32000 heart disease deaths 
the heart disease deaths combined with the cancer deaths make 
passive smoking the third leading cause of preventable death 
behind smoking and alcohol he said 
glantz is a researcher and statistician who conducts research in 
cardiology has written two textbooks on biostatistics and serves 
on the california state scientific review panel on toxic air 
contaminants 
his collaborator in the study was dr william parmley a 
cardiologist chief of the division of cardiology at university of 
california san francisco and a past president of the american 
college of cardiology 
the tobacco institute which represents cigarette makers 
emphasized that the surgeon general in 1986 had failed to find 
proof that passive smoking causes heart disease 
there have been only three studies since then and they 
continue to support the conclusions brennan dawson a 
spokeswoman for the institute said in a telephone interview friday 
but glantz said there are 11 studies on passive smoking and 
heart disease deaths and all but one the tobacco industry funded 
show an increased risk the studies showed an increased risk of 
between 20 percent and 30 percent he said 
furthermore he said theres evidence from several areas that 
passive smoking reduces the ability of the heart to obtain and 
profit from oxygen 
carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke binds with hemoglobin in the 
blood reducing its capacity to carry oxygen glantz said smoke 
also reduces the ability of cells in the heart to covert oxygen to 
a chemical called adenosine triphosphate or atp which provides 
energy to the heart he said 
what you end up with is the blood doesnt carry oxygen well 
the heart doesnt pump as well and what oxygen gets to the heart 
isnt used as well he said 
one consequence of that which can be measured is that people 
exposed to secondhand smoke cant exercise as long he said that 
is true of both healthy nonsmokers and nonsmokers with heart 
disease he said 
cancercausing agents in the smoke especially benzoapyrene 
have been found to injure artery linings he said such injuries 
are one of the first steps in the development of lifethreatening 
blood clots in the coronary arteries that nourish the heart he 
said 
studies have also shown that blood platelets which help blood 
clot become stickier and more likely to clot in nonsmokers 
exposed to cigarette smoke in fact nonsmokers are much more 
sensitive to this effect than are smokers he said 
this stickiness can increase the risk of clotting in the 
coronary arteries glantz said

a state ban on life insurance policies 
that regulators consider unfair to the elderly could be the start 
of a national trend if it withstands an industry challenge in 
court officials say 
the policies typically are advertised on television with the 
appeal you cannot be canceled your premium can never go up and 
your protection can never go down 
the policies offer immediate protection and are intended for the 
elderly but they require high premiums that can amount to more 
than the benefits at death 
washington insurance commissioner dick marquardt adopted a 
regulation last year that restricts the sale of such policies two 
insurance companies that specialize in the policies challenged the 
regulation in superior court and lost they appealed and the state 
supreme court is scheduled to take up the case may 24 
were a trailblazer with this regulation marquardt said 
other state regulators are inquiring and the fact that were in 
court points up the fact were a leader in this type of 
regulation 
marquardt said he searched for years for a way to ban the 
policies since he cannot regulate life insurance policies or 
rates he came up with a regulation against unfair competition or 
deceptive acts or practices 
we have been concerned because many plans currently on the 
market literally trap the insured individual in a nowin 
situation said david rodgers the states chief deputy insurance 
commissioner 
rodgers said elderly holders of the policies would be better off 
putting the money in a bank he gave the following example 
a 77yearold woman buys a 10year policy at a monthly premium 
of 2155 the death benefit starts at 500 and increases to 1000 
after 10 years if the woman had simply banked the money at 5 
percent interest the return would have been better rodgers said 
he said after the first year premiums plus interest would have 
totaled 266 had the woman died in the first year her estate 
would have received 500 or 234 more than premiums rodgers said 
after that the estate would lose 
premiums and interest after the second year would have totaled 
544 the benefit 540 at the end of 10 years premiums plus 
interest would have totaled 3340 the benefit 1000 
unless the olicyholder dies within a small window of time the 
premium will be more than the benefit rodgers said even if 
the policyholder dies within the window of time the gain for the 
estate is often so small as to be meaningless even in a modest 
estate 
the challenge has been mounted by omega national insurance co 
which has been doing business in washington since 1979 and pierce 
national insurance co it has been doing business in the state 
since 1948 
most of the life insurance policies the companies handled in 
washington were banned their lawyers said in court papers the 
regulation they said violates a fundamental precept of 
insurance that risk classifications should be equitable 
the companies said that forcing them to dump the policies would 
force younger healthier policyholders to subsidize the elderly 
they said marquardt has attacked a perceived but unsubstantiated 
problem with a sledge hammer

the house is aiming for a vote this week on 
clean air legislation but first must decide whether to require 
automakers to manufacture nongasoline cars for nine of the most 
polluted cities 
house leaders have said they want a vote on the bill before 
congress begins its memorial day recess on friday floor debate was 
scheduled to begin today on the measure which would be the first 
revision of federal air pollution laws in 13 years 
the senate approved clean air legislation in april after lengthy 
private discussions between senate leaders and the white house 
the bush administration has had no such discussions in the 
house where the energy and commerce committee produced a bill by a 
411 vote in april 
both versions would cost the economy about 21 billion a year 
when the new controls go fully into effect 
the house bill like the senate version calls for steep cuts in 
acid rain pollutants as well as unprecedented controls on urban 
smog largely from automobiles and curbs on toxic industrial 
emissions 
were pretty well where were going to stay rep terry 
bruce dill said of most of the major components of the package 
including provisions that will force coalburning electric 
utilities to reduce their annual acid rain emissions by 10 million 
tons 
key congressmen and their staffs were holding private talks in 
hopes of working out agreements on some of the dozen or so 
amendments expected to be brought to the floor for votes probably 
wednesday and thursday 
the proposed amendments include one by rep henry waxman 
dcalif that would require automakers to manufacture up to 1 
million alternativefuel cars for sale in nine of the most 
smogtroubled cities 
a tentative agreement was reached on a proposal to require use 
of a cleaner fuel in dozens of cities to curb the urban smog 
problem 
but no deal was expected on the waxman amendment or on a 
proposal to broaden the phaseout of chemicals that damage the 
atmospheric ozone layer those issues are likely to be thrashed out 
on the house floor sources said 
waxmans amendment calls for manufacturers to build up to 1 
million alternative fuel vehicles to be sold in the nine cities 
the automakers who oppose the amendment have a strong ally in 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the energy and commerce 
committee 
the automakers argue that no one has shown that cars powered by 
such fuels as methanol ethanol natural gas or electricity would be 
accepted by the public especially if there was uncertainty about 
the fuel supply 
the fate of alternative fuel vehicles hinges on consumer 
acceptance and consumers are flashing a yellow warning light 
argues thomas hanna president of the motor vehicle manufacturers 
association supporters of waxmans amendment suggest that by late 
in the decade when such cars would have to be produced the fuel 
availability issue will have been resolved 
industry also has lobbied vigorously against the amendment that 
would broaden the phaseout requirements on ozonedepleting 
chemicals including some that are considered bridge 
substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons or cfc manufacturers already 
are committed to phasing out cfcs but have argued they need the 
bridge substitutes

clujnapoca romania ap ethnic hungarians and romanians put 
aside their traditional enmity for at least one day as they flocked 
to the polls throughout transylvania where bloody ethnic clashes 
erupted earlier this year 
there had been fears that the volatile passions aroused by the 
campaign might lead to violence on election day in march six 
people died and some 300 were injured in clashes in the town of 
tirgu mures 
but on sunday both ethnic hungarians and romanians relished the 
opportunity to cast votes in the countrys first free elections in 
53 years 
we found the romanians genuinely excited about the chance to 
vote freely said eric koenig a member of the washingtonbased 
human rights law group and among about 500 foreign observers 
monitoring the election 
in this area we didnt see any evidence of an organized 
effort to tamper with or influence the voting process said 
koenig after touring polling places in clujnapoca and nearby 
villages sunday 
sandor balazs president of the cluj chapter of the hungarian 
democratic union a group representing romanias 2millionstrong 
hungarian minority said members of the rival ethnic communities 
even shared horsedrawn carts to get to rural polling places 
under ousted communist dictator nicolae ceausescu ethnic 
hungarians complained of discrimination saying their language and 
cultural traditions were being suppressed 
the democratic union says the hungarians must continue to fight 
for their rights following the bloody december revolution that led 
to ceausescus execution 
an exit poll taken by a west german polling firm showed the 
ethnic hungarian party winning 6 percent of the votes nationwide 
for seats in the twochamber parliament 
in the cluj region the only major complaint was the same echoed 
elsewhere in the country the long lines of people waiting to 
vote due to a heavy turnout and complicated voting procedures 
ive been coming by all day hoping the crowd diminished 
complained tibor szekely an 85yearold ethnic hungarian as he 
viewed the long line stretching outside a downtown polling station 
in a school 
in leglia a sleepy ethnic hungarian village of 700 peasants 
about 20 miles northwest of cluj residents complained about having 
to travel to a nearby village to vote 
but fears of a hostile reception by the romanian residents of 
aghires one mile down the road did not materialize 
there was even a long line of voters outside the romanian 
embassy in the hungarian capital of budapest at least 15000 
romanian citizens most of them ethnic hungarians fled to hungary 
to escape the ceausescu regime 
those who still retained their romanian citizenship seemed eager 
to vote the hungarian news agency mti said about 3500 had voted 
at the embassy by early evening and thousands more were waiting 
transylvania was ruled by hungary for centuries before being 
ceded to romania after world war i hungary annexed the province 
during world war ii but it was returned to romania when the war 
ended

president lee tenghui marked his 
inauguration by calling for an end to hostilities and improved 
relations with chinas communist government 
lees remarks during sundays presidential inauguration ceremony 
marked the first time a taiwan president publicly indicated a 
desire to move away from the 40yearold policy of the three 
nos toward beijing no official contact no negotiations and no 
compromise 
in beijing there was no mention of lees speech in any of the 
nationally circulated official dailies and the government declined 
immediate comment 
an official of the taiwan department in the state councils 
overseas chinese office asked for reaction on lees speech 
referred questions to the foreign ministry the ministry which 
usually says taiwan is part of china and thus not a foreign affairs 
matter had no immediate response 
at his inauguration lee also promised amnesty for political 
prisoners he pledged the restoration of civil rights to previously 
jailed political prisoners including the chairman of the 
opposition democratic progressive party allowing them to run for 
public office 
nine people imprisoned on sedition charges were released sunday 
including hsu hsinliang 49 who was jailed last year after 
returning from selfimposed exile in the united states 
taiwans bestknown political prisoner shih mingteh was 
released early this morning he had been jailed in 1979 on charges 
of instigating an antigovernment riot in the southern port city of 
kaohsiung 
he had originally refused to allow his family to sign for his 
release because he maintains he is innocent his sister said 
human rights groups claim taiwan has roughly a dozen other 
political prisoners 
meanwhile lees nomination of defense minister hau peitsun 
the nations only fourstar general as premier continued to spark 
protests on sunday haus opponents believe his nomination is a 
step backward for democracy and could lead to a resurgence of 
military influence 
about 10000 people including students and opposition party 
members staged a noisy march through taipei smashing windows and 
throwing eggs at offices of the military and the ruling nationalist 
party 
lee heads the nationalist chinese government that has been based 
on the island of taiwan ever since losing a civil war to communist 
forces on the chinese mainland in 1949 
the nationalists still claim to be the rightful government of 
all china and beijing regards taiwan as a renegade province 
lee proposed establishing channels of communication and said 
the two countries should completely open up academic cultural 
economic trade scientific and technological exchange to lay a 
foundation of mutual respect peace and prosperity 
but lee said before relations could be established beijing must 
renounce the use of force against taiwan end its policy of 
isolating taiwan diplomatically and promote democracy and a free 
economic system in china 
while beijing previously has indicated it would not meet 
conditions set by lee the speech clearly was designed to reflect 
taipeis desire to gradually improve relations with its neighbor 
across the taiwan straits recently civilian and business contacts 
have been growing between the two sides 
lee became the first native taiwanese to lead the government in 
january 1988 when he moved up from the vice presidency to succeed 
president chiang chingkuo who died in office 
chiang was the eldest son of chiang kaishek the nationalist 
leader who led the retreat to taiwan four decades ago

a highranking chinese communist 
party official who left hong kong for los angeles has no plans to 
defect and merely wants some rest and relaxation his host says 
master hsing yun a buddhist monk held a news conference at hsi 
lai temple in hacienda heights 20 miles from los angeles to 
dispel reports that xu jiatun defected 
xu director of the hong kong branch of the xinhua news agency 
for nearly seven years did not appear at the news conference 
hsing yun would not disclose his whereabouts or say how long he 
planned to stay 
because we are friends i do not have the right to ask why he 
came or for how long the monk said through an interpreter he 
said he did not come here to seek political asylum 
he told me that after he rests for a while hes planning to 
make a broad survey and research on american society he still 
wishes to go back to his country and will not ever seek political 
asylum 
he has been in seclusion since arriving in california on may 1 
the buddhist master said he and xu have taken several trips 
together including a visit to the grand canyon 
as bureau chief of the beijingcontrolled new china news agency 
in hong kong xu was chinas top representative to the british 
colony from 1983 until last year his assignment was to prepare 
hong kong for its return to china in 1997 
xu reportedly fell out of favor with the government of premier 
li peng after revealing his sympathy toward the prodemocracy 
movement that was crushed last june in tiananmen square 
xu 74 was reported to have left without the approval of his 
government but hsing yun said he believed xu had permission to 
visit the united states and that he was carrying a visa good for up 
to six months 
public confidence in hong kongs future under chinese rule was 
shaken by xus departure many of hong kongs 57 million residents 
have long been suspicious of chinas plans for the territory after 
the british leave 
on thursday the foreign ministry in beijing said xu was merely 
touring and taking a rest in the united states

government officials called today 
for a halt to to the violent protests that have rocked this 
southern provincial city for the past three days 
also today radical student leaders demanded that police be held 
responsible for the death of a student who suffered fatal head 
injuries saturday after jumping from a train in an effort to join 
the protesters 
the students said 21yearold shin jangho would be buried as a 
martyr and patriot wednesday after funeral services at kwangjus 
chonnam university about 100 militant students armed with metal 
pipes guarded the hospital morgue where shins body was kept 
shin was among thousands of students who tried to avoid police 
roadblocks in an effort to reach kwangju for protest rallies 
marking the 10th anniversary of the countrys bloodiest civilian 
uprising 
several thousand riot police who have been deployed in the 
vicinity of the provincial government building since protests 
erupted friday stayed mostly out of sight today apparently to 
avoid antagonizing the radicals 
in the past the deaths of protesters have triggered massive 
demonstrations 
kwangju mayor choi inkee issued a statement saying the protests 
against the government of president roh taewoo and the presence of 
us troops in korea had been instigated by outsiders 
violence will no longer be tolerated the statement said 
other government officials also demanded an end to the protests 
radical student leader lee kihon told a news conference today 
that the ruling democratic liberal party was a violent group 
he demanded that police officials be held accountable for shins 
death and said those responsible should resign the student 
protesters say that if the police roadblocks had not been in place 
shin would not have had to jump from the train 
the district prosecutors office in kwangju said today that 
testimony from train workers and other witnesses indicated shin 
died of injuries suffered when he jumped from the train the 
prosecutor said an autopsy would be performed to confirm the 
finding 
on sunday violence erupted for a third straight day when some 
10000 protesters shouting down with roh taewoo battled riot 
police in downtown streets protesters tore up sidewalks for 
projectiles to hurl at police and built bonfires at a dozen 
intersections to light firebombs 
police fired 40 warning shots from automatic rifles to stop 
about 50 protesters who tried to stage a firebomb attack on a 
police station 
seouls donga ilbo newspaper said 84 police officers and more 
than 200 protesters were injured 
the newspaper said 6342 people had been arrested nationwide 
since may 18 most of them in kwangju about 150 miles south of 
seoul of those arrested it said 15 were formally charged with 
instigating unrest 35 sent before a summary court judge and 130 
others remained under investigation the rest were released with 
warnings it said 
the protesters are demanding the resignation of roh a former 
army general who was a key leader of the martial law government 
that crushed the 1980 kwanju prodemocracy uprising they claim the 
january merger of the ruling party with two opposition groups is a 
scheme by roh to prolong his power 
kwangju citizens claim us military officials condoned the 
military crackdown on the 1980 uprising which claimed some 200 
lives and left more than 1700 injured

exxon has begun applying fertilizer to 
the shoreline to speed the breakdown of oil from the exxon valdez 
spill 
the company got the goahead from the state to use the chemicals 
after a debate over whether they would cause even more harm to the 
environment 
our key objective is to achieve the appropriate level of 
cleanup with the least amount of stress on the environment said 
bob mastracchio exxons technical manager for the cleanup 
this years cleanup got under way may 1 with crews removing tar 
by hand exxon expects to complete its work by midaugust under a 
cleanup plan approved by the governments cleanup coordinator said 
exxon spokesman joe tucker 
the exxon valdez ran aground on a reef on march 24 1989 
spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into the clear 
waters of prince william sound 
after the spill thousands of cleanup workers and hundreds of 
boats worked for weeks to clean hundreds of miles of shoreline 
thousands of birds mammals and other wildlife were killed in the 
nations worst oil spill 
late sunday workers began spreading nitrogen and phosphorous 
fertilizer in liquid and granular form the chemicals promote the 
growth of bacteria that eat oil 
three boats and 29 people were deployed to coat about 175 square 
yards tucker said only three three or four workers were actually 
applying the fertilizer most of the rest were federal state or 
company officials observing the work 
to protect birds and other wildlife from the potentially harmful 
chemicals crews put out brightlycolored helium balloons and roped 
off the treated areas with flags 
the cleansing action of the tides will reduce the risk after the 
first 24 hours exxon said 
the company plans to use the fertilizer on about 400 sites last 
year 74 miles of shoreline were treated 
a multiagency team will monitor the sites for six weeks to help 
judge the effectiveness of the technique bioremediation and 
decide whether second applications of the fertilizer will be made 
during the summer exxon said 
state officials and some environmental groups have expressed 
fears that the chemicals might further pollute the water or harm 
wildlife 
after weeks of debate the state finally agreed with exxon and 
the coast guard that the technique should be used despite the risks

candles in 10 white house windows

franciscos city hall for a solemn reading of the names of recent 
aids victims as gospel music played through speakers the crowd 
shouted we will not forget after each name 
similar activities were held in new york washington salt lake 
city and seattle in an annual observance organized by the 
mobilization against aids based in san francisco 
it helps to remember said harvey maurer an aids activist 
at the san francisco ceremony he was diagnosed with the disease 1 
years ago 
from an intellectual point of view i still can have hope that 
well see a cure but i also know that i keep losing people 
mrs bush participated by placing a candle in each of 10 white 
house windows facing pennsylvania avenue said spokeswoman anna 
peres the candles were in the secondfloor residential portion of 
the white house she said 
i think this is encouraging that the lights are in the white

support said andy ilves spokesman for the mobilization against 
aids

organized in 1983 to draw attention to the toll aids was taking on 
homosexuals

or linked arm and arm and some in drag 
this is the 1000 points of light that bush hasnt looked 
at said robert george a member of the interfaith aids

former hostage frank reed once traveled to 
exotic places around the globe now he heads home nearly broke 
facing the likelihood of living with his wife and child in his 
mothers small apartment 
held captive 42 months in the middle east reed returns to this 
boston suburb this weekend or early next week from a maryland 
hospital 
to friends and relatives reed 57 was an almost 
largerthanlife figure an adventurer who studied at harvard and 
trekked to the north pole the jungles of brazil and the australian 
outback before accepting a post at beiruts international college 
in 1977 
he was a fellow who would take risks said reeds brother 
edward he stayed in beirut even though he knew it was 
dangerous 
in 1986 reed was seized from his car by gunmen and held by 
moslem extremists for the next 3 years 
when he was released last month a pale gaunt reed told of 
being beaten when he tried to escape and of being chained and 
blindfolded for months at a time 
reeds family and friends are preparing as best they can for 
his return home reed has no job little money and no home of his 
own 
a lot of pieces need to be put together said bob langston 
his soninlaw medical care housing these all need to be dealt 
with a lot depends on his health 
reed is still weak and relatives say he has memory lapses 
apparently caused by beatings to the head he remembers the past 
very well but had troubles with things that happened the other 
day said his mother leota sprague 91 
his wife fahima holds a job at an insurance firm she and her 
9yearold son tarek have lived with reeds mother in her 
twobedroom apartment for almost a year 
reed had money invested in his school in beirut sprague said 
but that was lost when the school was bombed out 
i was blessed i had a job to come back to said jeremy 
levin former cable news network bureau chief in beirut who was 
held by kidnappers for 13 months before gaining freedom in 1985 
but the recovery will be slower for him he has no job so the 
reeds may have a problem it could be a terrible burden on him 
former hostages and psychiatric experts said reed may also have 
to overcome psychological hurdles to readjust to an ordinary life 
after having lived under extraordinary circumstances 
freed hostages also find they are sudden celebrities sought by 
reporters and talk show hosts 
i couldnt get back into the normal swing of things at 
first levin said in a telephone interview from washington we 
all did a lot of public speaking and that put off the time of 
getting into a normal routine 
once the spotlight turns elsewhere former hostages are left to 
deal with the everyday world 
when youre a hostage you give up thinking about the future 
because you have no future you could be killed tomorrow said 
brian schulman a psychiatrist in bethesda md who has counseled 
vietnam veterans and concentration camp victims then youre 
released and suddenly you have to think about mundane things like 
getting a job 
all people know about frank reed is that hes been a 
hostage schulman said but hostages eventually become old 
news and thats when they have to reestablish their lives

cuban exiles sailed across the choppy 
florida straits for a highseas democracy rally at the edge of 
cubas waters where they threw wreaths and bottles carrying 
messages overboard 
cuban patrol boats looked on but took no action against the 
flotilla that left sunday from key west 
backers of the expedition said it was a demonstration against 
cubas communist government and a celebration of the anniversary of 
cubas independence from spain 
it was a very emotional moment for all the cubans who 
participated in this said julio rebull of miami 
some smaller boats among the 34 that started out turned back 
because of 8foot waves the boats rendezvoused about 20 miles off 
cubas northern coast then sailed parallel to the coast for six 
miles before heading back to key west 
for seven minutes a roman catholic priest read prayers over the 
radio to a cuban radio monitor at a havana lighthouse rebull said 
the operator acknowledged the message but made no further response 
the current on the straits carried the flowers and bottles 
north away from cuba 
coast guard cutters monitored the flotilla by radar but provided 
no escort coast guard officials earlier warned the exiles to lodge 
verbal protests but to go along peacefully if they were intercepted 
by cuban forces 
at least one boat carrying a tv news crew from miami had to turn 
back in the middle of the windswept gulf stream because of 
seasickness

stan stephens has run charter boats out of 
this port town for 20 years but this is the first season bligh 
reef rated a mention on his tourist brochure 
a growing number of tourists want a look at the site of the 
nations largest oil spill even though only a buoy marks the spot 
where the exxon valdez rammed the reef 
were including that in our new schedule to make sure we swing 
by it because it has become part of the history of the sound 
stephens said everyone last year asked we had thousands of oil 
questions 
inquiries from prospective tourists for the summer were up 30 
percent over winter the valdez convention and visitors bureau said 
marilyn mitchell of the valdez chamber of commerce chalks up 
some of the interest to morbid curiosity 
i think its human nature she said people want to see 
where things happen theres been a lot of interest in people 
wanting to come and just see where the ship went off the reef 
its too soon to know how many people actually will visit but 
bookings at some motels bed and breakfasts and charter companies 
are going strong said the visitors bureau director gary 
kranenberg 
indications are that this years tourist visits may not only 
rebound to 1988 levels of about 100000 the highest on record but 
could surpass that number by up to 15 percent 
about a dozen travel writers normally come to valdez before the 
tourist season this year 150 dropped in kranenberg said 
most visitors come to valdez for sightseeing and fishing the 
spill which occurred in march 1989 simply made more people aware 
of the towns scenic beauty tourism officials say 
still this years tourists want to know where the oil was

a toothy beauty named petunia captivated 
judges for the third time in five years to become the most 
beautiful burro in texas 
petunia has a fine set of teeth said henry wolff jr a 
newspaper columnist who founded an annual beauty contest for the 
pack animals under the auspices of the better burro bureau 
the judges picked petunia in 1986 last year and again sunday 
burros were brought to texas by spanish settlers in the early 
1700s 
dictionaries point out that burros and donkeys are asses but 
wolff who works for the victoria advocate said he makes it a 
point to avoid using that word in reference to the competition he 
began in 1983 
we do say this is the place where people can come and show 
their blankblankblank if theyve got one thats the fun of 
it he said 
entrants are dressed up in costumes nearly 4000 people 
attended the contest at the texas zoo 
one contender this year did not help her cause when she walked 
down the runway 
lets just say she wet down the stage wolff said i think 
she had been saving up for the contest

coast guardsmen in the florida keys have been 
jailed for helping cocaine smugglers a coast guard spokesman said 
but the alleged corruption outlined in the report aired sunday 
on nbcs expose program actually was detected and dealt with 
two years ago according to lt cmdr jeff karonis spokesman for 
the coast guards miamibased southeastern district 
nbc cited unidentified federal authorities and tom cash chief 
of the us drug enforcement administration office in miami as 
saying the guardsmen disabled patrol boats and sold drug agents 
codes to smugglers 
raids by federal authorities on smugglers homes turned up 
records of secret radio frequencies patrol schedules and codes 
used in radio transmissions for every law enforcement agency in the 
florida keys nbc reported 
federal authorities investigating the relationship between 
smugglers and us coast guardsmen have named the case operation 
tempest 
nbc reported that at least 15 guardsmen assigned to the 
islamorada station worked either for or with the smugglers they 
were assigned to catch 
four guardsmen stationed at islamorada all crew members of a 
highspeed boat used to intercept smugglers are in jail for taking 
cocaine from the smugglers nbc reported 
the coast guard people involved were brought to justice and 
are in jail right now the system works and theyre paying for 
it karonis said after the broadcast 
the nbc report did not say when the alleged corruption occurred 
karonis contacted late sunday by the associated press said the 
coast guard detected the alleged conspiracy and stopped it back 
in 1988 
art sola the commander of the crew that stole cocaine from 
smugglers for themselves was convicted on drug charges handed down 
in july 1988 by federal prosecutors in north carolina karonis said 
karonis said other guardsmen were indicted a short time later 
they were convicted in separate trials later that year he said he 
added that that few newspapers reported the case at the time 
sola told nbc he and his fellow guardsmen decided one afternoon 
to steal a kilogram of cocaine from a shipment they found floating 
in the atlantic ocean 15 miles offshore 
the cocaine according to the report was worth as much as 
16000 about the same as the guardsmens annual salary at the 
time 
its easy its very easy its a lifestyle down there 
everybody knows somebody whos involved in drugs or smuggling its 
very easy to get hooked on sola said in a jailhouse interview 
nbc reported that another guardsman identified on expose as 
bobby gosnell also got caught up in drug smuggling gosnell nbc 
reported bought a 500000 home with an airstrip after leaving the 
coast guard 
but gosnell wound up murdered shot in the chest in a dispute 
over whether he should cooperate with the federal investigation 
nbc said 
karonis contacted at home late sunday said he had no further 
details on the case but he expressed confidence that little 
corruption remains at the islamorada office today 
every agency has bad apples but were confident the vast 
majority of coast guard people are honest and do their job every 
day he said

a top iraqi official met today with 
syrian president hafez assad to deliver an invitation to an arab 
league summit 
it was the first time a senior iraqi official has visited syria 
since the feuding arab countries broke diplomatic relations in 
1979 assad and iraqi president saddam hussein are bitter enemies 
iraqi justice minister akram abdulqader arrived today aboard a 
special iraqi airways jet carrying an invitation to the may 28 
summit from saddam 
abdulqader later met with assad and syrian foreign minister 
farouk alsharaa according to assads presidential spokesman 
gibrane kouriem 
there was no immediate word on assads response to the 
invitation 
so far assad has resisted appeals from egyptian president hosni 
mubarak and other arab leaders to attend the summit in baghdad the 
iraqi capital in the interest of arab unity 
saddam has called the summit to discuss arab concerns about the 
expected influx of tens of thousands of soviet jewish emigrants to 
israel as well as a perceived israeli and imperialist threat to 
iraq 
saddam is seeking to rally support after britain and the united 
states accused iraq of trying to smuggle nuclear bomb triggers 
iraq denied it is developing nuclear weapons but threatened to use 
chemical weapons against israel if attacked 
the iraqis are also seeking to rally support after iraqbound 
shipments said to contain parts for a super gun capable of 
hitting israel were seized in britain greece turkey and italy 
in a related development palestine liberation organization 
leader yasser arafat arrived in baghdad today to meet with iraqi 
foreign minister tariq aziz who invited him to the summit 
the plo announced friday that arafat had sent a letter to 
damascus urging syria to reverse its stand boycotting the meeting 
mediation efforts earlier this month by saudi arabia jordan and 
egypt all failed assad has remained adamant that neither he nor 
other syrian officials will attend 
assad has insisted that the location and agenda of the summit 
must first be discussed at an emergency meeting of foreign 
ministers of the 22member arab league in tunisia 
but iraq has said the summit will go ahead as planned in 
baghdad preceded by a foreign ministers meeting on may 22 in the 
iraqi capital to set the agenda 
syria and iraq are ruled by rival wings of the baath arab 
socialist party 
their feud deepened during the eightyear iraniraq war when 
syria supported the iranians while most arab countries sided with 
iraq 
saddam in turn has supported christian factions in lebanon 
that are opposed to syria thwarting assads efforts to end the 
15yearold lebanese civil war

seized 25 million during what they believed was one of the dallas 
areas largest ever drugtainted cash shipments the dallas times 
herald reported today 
agents converged on an american airlines jetliner arriving at

was transporting currency from the san antonio branch of the 
federal reserve bank of dallas said phil jordan special agent in 
charge of the us drug enforcement administration office in dallas 
the money was loaded at the san antonio airport after its 
arrival at the dallasfort worth airport it was to be transferred 
by armed private security guards to a new yorkbound jet west

at the san antonio airport he was transferring a large amount of 
cash that person called local authorities who then alerted 
airport officials 
money is transferred in cargo holds all the time said 
robert boykin of the federal reserve in dallas theres nothing 
unusual about that

after a week of heightening citywide strife then led a memorial 
parade for martin luther king jr through midtown manhattan 
tensions are threatening to plunge new york into a cycle of 
fear and frustration that could tear us apart dinkins said 
sunday at the salem united methodist church in harlem 
he urged the city to begin healing recent wounds before the

the store boycotts and the severe beating of a vietnamese man by 
a young black man combined with two jury verdicts in the brooklyn 
racial mobkilling case of 16yearold yusuf hawkins to inflame 
racial tensions

mob leader 19yearold keith mondello of murder and manslaughter

alone before the altar and buried his face in his hands 
then he stepped to the pulpit 
we all come from somewhere else we came here to escape 
prejudice all of our people share an ancestry of oppression he 
said 
dinkins praised erasmus hall high school students who last week 
defied the store boycott and shopped at one of the korean groceries 
the boycott was triggered by accusations that a black woman was 
attacked in a store in january by koreanamerican employees who 
suspected her of shoplifting 
some in the church crowd punctuated the mayors words with 
outbursts of affirmation and an elderly woman repeated bless 
you bless you 
later dinkins led a mostly black throng of marchers in the 
martin luther king jr memorial parade up fifth avenue 
this years parade is more important than any other 
cardinal john oconnor said as he greeted the crowd on the steps of 
st patricks cathedral king would have been very saddened but 
he would have told all of us to calm down 
silkcostumed korean schoolchildren joined black students atop 
the gorgeous mosaic float a rotating globe with ethnic flags 
whose name is dinkins favorite term for new yorks ethnic 
diversity

believe race relations have worsened 
the daily newseyewitness news poll of 670 people 213 of whom 
are black found both races agreed that racial tensions are 
building three percent said relations were better and 20 percent

tuberculosis is alarming health officials again 
because its posing new health threats with its connection to the 
aids virus 
a 35 percent increase in tuberculosis in 1989 in newark nj 
has caught the attention of health officials who had been 
previously recording with satisfaction a slow steady decrease in 
tb cases over the last few decades 
they attribute the 5 percent national increase in tb cases in 
1989 to the ravages of the aids virus which destroys the bodys 
immune system and leaves victims open to tb infection dr philip 
c hopewell of san francisco general hospital said sunday 
hopewell and other health officials discussed the link between 
aids and tb during the a fourday world conference on lung health 
in boston which ends wednesday 
about 4 percent of americans identified as having the aids virus 
also have been diagnosed as being infected with tuberculosis said 
dr dixie e snider jr director of the division of tuberculosis 
control at the centers for disease control in atlanta the american 
lung association estimates that 20000 americans a year develop tb 
in parts of africa where aids is already a health risk 
tuberculosis has become epidemic said dr annik rouillon 
executive director of the international union against tuberculosis 
and lung disease in paris 
the combination of the two is really catastrophic she said 
snider stressed that tuberculosis unlike aids is a curable 
disease and called for tb screenings at drug rehabilitation 
programs prisons or other places where aids tests are being 
administered 
snider also said doctors should administer tb tests to all 
persons testing positive for the hiv virus since tb may not be 
readily diagnosed in aids patients 
its important we get control of the situation he said 
in wyoming the centers for disease control recorded no new 
cases of tb in 1989 demonstrating that it is a condition that can 
be controlled and cured according to dr lee b reichman director 
of the pulmonary division of the university of medicine and 
dentistry in new jersey 
i have never heard of a rise of the magnitude seen in new 
jersey or on the other hand the hope generated by no cases in one 
state reichman said 
moreover unlike aids tb is a highly contagious disease that 
can be spread by airborne particles coughed up by a person with 
untreated clinically active pulmonary tb untreated tuberculosis 
kills about 50 percent of its victims within two years according 
to the centers for disease control 
snider said sustained contact is necessary for tb transmission 
and would not pose new problems for aids victims already fighting 
discrimination in jobs and housing however he noted that there 
had been an increase in positive tb tests among aids health workers 
tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium that commonly affects the 
lungs but can attack almost any organ for the last three decades 
it has been preventable and curable through multiple drug therapy 
snider said 
snider said 10 million to 15 million americans have been 
infected with the tuberculosis germ but only a small percentage of 
them develop the disease because their immune system was strong 
enough to prevent the disease from developing 
if however a persons immune system is impaired by poor 
nutrition or weakened by the hiv virus people can develop active 
tb 
tb is long known as an opportunistic organism hopewell said 
the doctors said us minority groups have become increasing 
susceptible to tb snider said there has been a 150 percent 
increased in cases of tb among young blacks in new york city 
tuberculosis can be effectively treated even in aids patients 
underscoring efforts to screen persons for the disease the doctor 
said 
reichman noted that most american have forgotten about the 
problems of tb from 1981 to 1984 tb cases declined an average of 
6 percent per year according to the centers for disease control 
but he said tb is back with a vengeance 
while associated with poverty and crowded living conditions tb 
through history has ravaged both the poor and the famous tb 
victims include henry david thoreau washington irving franz 
kafka ring lardner somerset maugham and vivien leigh 
an estimated 3 million persons a year die worldwide from tb 
according to the american lung association

attorney general dick thornburgh has denied 
that he tried to cover up when a top aide showed deception on a lie 
detector test while the justice department was investigating news 
leaks 
thornburgh said deputy attorney general donald b ayer the 
agencys departing no 2 official was sadly misinformed in 
criticizing how the case was handled 
ayer who has resigned effective friday has charged that 
thornburgh mishandled the justice departments investigation in an 
attempt to protect robert s robin ross a longtime thornburgh 
aide 
the attorney general was participating in an effort to prevent 
appropriate disclosure and evaluation through established 
procedures of the activities that earlier this week resulted in 
robin ross abrupt removal from office ayer was quoted as saying 
in sundays los angeles times 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity have told the 
associated press that ross and another veteran thornburgh aide 
david runkel showed deception on polygraph tests the tests were 
given as part of the departments attempt to find who leaked 
information to reporters about an investigation into alleged 
financial irregularities involving rep william gray dpa 
thornburgh appearing sunday on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley program replied absolutely not when asked if he 
tried to conceal rosss performance on the lie detector test 
we conducted an investigation into leaks there was no 
evidence that tied any person on my staff to the unauthorized 
disclosure of that information thornburgh said 
the attorney general also said that failing a polygraph test 
isnt evidence of wrongdoing not in our courts of law 
thornburgh said he was saddened that ayer feels that he has to 
lash out against his former colleagues but there is no basis in 
fact for that kind of story 
the justice department has had a series of highlevel personnel 
changes since ayer announced may 11 that he was leaving 
ross resigned three days later as thornburghs executive 
assistant to head a new international division he said he plans to 
leave the department in two or three months runkel was reassigned 
from serving as spokesman taking on the new title of director of 
communications 
in the los angeles times interview ayer criticized the way 
thornburgh dealt with the gray case thornburgh had ordered the 
investigation into the leaks which democrats charged were 
politically motivated last spring while gray was running for the 
house majority whip post 
ayer said thornburgh tried to keep the results of the leak 
investigation out of the hands of the departments internal 
watchdog agency the office of professional responsibility 
unsuccessful in that attempt thornburgh then refused to follow the 
units recommendation for further investigation ayer told the 
newspaper 
ayer did not return a telephone call sunday seeking comment 
thornburgh reported to congress in september that the criminal 
investigation of the gray leak failed to identify the source of the 
story 
the attorney general told congress the head of opr had concurred 
with the conclusion to drop the investigation but ayer said the 
internal watchdog agency had never seen the report 
when ayer and two other top officials suggested to thornburgh on 
jan 30 that he remove himself from the case and turn it over to 
the watchdog agency the attorney general rejected our advice out 
of hand ayer said 
ultimately the case went to opr after prodding by sen joseph 
biden ddel chairman of the senate judiciary committee 
after the opr review was finished thornburgh turned the issue 
over to solicitor general kenneth starr who concurred with the 
attorney generals decision not to discipline any department 
officials

teenage mutant turtles exist offscreen 
but they are too sick to fight crime or eat pizza 
the unhappy green sea turtles suffer from an elephant manlike 
disease called fibropapilloma that causes tumors internally and on 
their eyes mouths necks flippers jaws and tails 
some tumors get larger than a softball and often reoccur 
said dr elliot jacobson a professor of wildlife medicine at the 
university of florida they make the turtle grotesque teenage 
mutant green turtles are for real 
afflicted turtles have been found off the florida keys in the 
indian river lagoon on floridas east coast the caribbean and near 
the hawaiian islands 
in the keys the plague is so widespread that experts say 50 
percent of the endangered green sea turtles are sick or dying from 
fibropapilloma which causes them to become blind or drown 
its an epidemic among green sea turtles comparable to aids in 
humans said jacobson who is heading a yearlong research project 
fibropapilloma was first identified by marine biologists in 
1938 its cause is unknown but the strongest theory blames a virus 
possibly aggravated by water pollution jacobson said recently 
scientists are unsure how many green turtles are left in the 
world but they are considered an endangered species they feed on 
seagrass and marine plants 
between 1983 and 1989 134 green sea turtles were found dead 
jacobson said seventy had fibropapilloma hardest hit were turtles 
in the teenage stages of life 
its hard to find a turtle that is healthy and free of 
growths said tina brown a conservationist and keys charter boat 
captain 
she and richard moretti recruited jacobson to study the disease 
at the hidden harbor marine environmental project center morettis 
statelicensed marine sanctuary on key vaca where marathon is 
located 
six healthy turtles on loan to the cleveland and the toledo zoos 
were returned to florida this month to participate in the study 
five others from clearwater found to be free of fibropapilloma but 
suffering handicaps round out a study group 
the 11 turtles are being housed in an 800gallon fiberglass 
tank where they will be infected and exposed to the disease in 
hopes of finding its agent and ultimately the key to a serum 
before fibropapilloma the most serious threat to the species 
was its popularity as the main ingredient in soup in the 1950s a 
federal law was passed prohibiting the sale or import of green sea 
turtles

determine whether the 12yearold is rejecting her second 
transplanted liver 
the worlds longest surviving heartliver transplant patient

texas after routine tests revealed high liver enzyme levels a 
sign of possible organ rejection 
they wanted to get it under control before it got to be a big 
problem said her mother lois suzie purcell who traveled to 
pittsburgh with stormie her numbers had been real good up until 
the last couple of weeks 
stormie was listed in fair condition today at childrens 
hospital of pittsburgh she walked into the hospital and met 
briefly with reporters at the behest of staff members who wanted to 
assure the public she was not critically ill 
remember im getting paid for this she joked and this is 
just for five minutes 
stormie said she felt fine and was not experiencing any symptoms

universal studios florida opens its doors 
to the public today for three weeks of sneak previews of a 
hollywoodstyle attraction expected to draw up to 6 million 
visitors in its first year 
guests will pay slightly more than halfprice and take in about 
half of the major rides and shows that will be functioning at the 
444acre orlando complex 
the 600 million attraction will officially open june 7 
universal owned by californiabased mca inc and rank 
organisation plc of london is going up against stiff competition 
the disneymgm studios theme park which opened a year ago just 
a few miles down the highway is based on a similar concept it 
reported about 8 million clicks of its turnstiles during that 
period 
universal which relied heavily on filmmaker steven spielbergs 
advice and creativity will spend 110 million in marketing the 
florida park before the year is out officials said 
not to be outdone disney has stepped up its own marketing 
campaign for its three florida attractions the magic kingdom 
epcot center and the 135acre disneymgm studios entertainment 
analysts say the company is spending at least 50 million this year 
on advertising 
disney officials underestimated the appeal of their studio park 
and disney co chairman michael eisner earlier this year announced 
a 10year expansion plan that would double its size 
in the headtohead competition with disney universal 
executives emphasize the new parks larger size the greater number 
of rides and shows and what they consider more sophisticated 
technology 
across the board were going to deliver a more impressive 
entertainment experience mca vice president jay stein said in a 
recent interview 
universals major lure is hollywoods great movies see the 
stars ride the movies is its theme 
top shows are based on king kong et the extraterrestrial 
jaws the killer shark the 1906 san francisco earthquake and other 
spectaculars 
weve made the movie experience something that fans can see 
feel touch and smell said spielberg 
after its grand opening the theme park segment of the complex 
will feature 15 major rides and shows and a back lot tour with 
50 locations including hollywood boulevard a new england village 
the san francisco wharf and new york street sets 
sneak preview tickets are 1595 for adults and 1295 for 
children after june 7 when all rides and shows are operating 
tickets will be almost twice that much

interim president ion iliescu a 
former communist appeared headed for a landslide victory today 
after romanias first free elections in 53 years but opponents 
complained of fraud 
the first official returns showed iliescu with an overwhelming 
lead in the presidential race his national salvation front 
appeared to be headed for victory in the parliamentary elections 
which would allow him to govern without forming a coalition with 
the opposition 
with more than 2 million ballots counted from sundays election 
iliescu won 89 percent to 8 percent for the national liberal 
partys candidate radu campeanu and 3 percent for ion ratiu of 
the national peasant party 
a west german exit poll of 14539 voters showed iliescu winning 
83 percent of the votes nationwide campeanu was second with 11 
percent and ratiu had 6 percent 
the chief us observer of the elections said romania had taken 
a very giant step toward democracy but that allegations of 
fraud must be assessed before the united states determines whether 
the election was free 
gov garrey e carruthers of new mexico urged the government to 
establish a freer press and set up an independent panel or allow 
the courts to investigate allegations of campaign and voting 
irregularities 
but others among the 500 foreign observers said that although 
there were some irregularities they were not significant enough to 
alter the outcome 
the two opposition candidates alleged numerous instances of 
election fraud ratiu said carruthers assessment of the election 
would mislead the american people and president bush 
there was no semblance of democracy about it ratiu said 
the front took power during the bloody december revolution in 
which communist dictator nicolae ceausescu was ousted and executed 
after 24 years of rule 
one of the main opposition charges against iliescu and the front 
was their refusal to relinquish control over radio television and 
newsprint the opposition argued that control of the airwaves gave 
the front an unfair advantage in the campaign 
the central electoral bureau estimated that at least 85 percent 
of romanias 168 million eligible voters cast ballots for 
president and 506 representatives to the twochamber parliament 
the front won a projected 66 percent of vote for seats in 
parliament said the exit poll conducted by the west german 
polling group infas at the invitation of the romanian government 
in second place was the national liberal party with about 10 
percent of the votes the poll said the party representing the 
countrys 2 million hungarian minority had 6 percent the 
ecological movement had 5 percent and the peasant party had 35 to 
4 percent according to the poll no margin of error was given 
the projected victory for the front would break a string of 
victories by centrist and conservative political parties in free 
elections held elsewhere in eastern europe following the ouster of 
old communist regimes 
communist reformers were overwhelmingly defeated in elections 
earlier this year in east germany and hungary 
iliescu a 60yearold former communist party secretary who fell 
out of favor with ceausescu praised citizens for their high 
turnout and calm behavior the state news agency rompress reported 
iliescu appeared to have capitalized on his standing as interim 
president he also gained popular credibility by opposing ceausescu 
in 1971 and then suffering demotion 
the front a loose grouping of former communists workers and 
technocrats advocated a more gradual pace of introducing free 
market reforms while the main opposition parties called for a 
swift dismantling of the communist system 
ratiu and campeanu both exiles who returned from long years 
abroad only after the revolution were vulnerable to charges that 
they were not in romania during the harshest ceausescu years 
voters had 88 parties to choose from and slowmoving lines of 
200 or more people snaked outside polling places the original 
closing time of 11 pm was extended when it became clear the 
voting was much slower than expected 
still voters relished the chance to cast ballots in their first 
free election since 1937 
in timisoara the cradle of the december revolution vancea 
aurel 78 a retired civil engineer was elated as he waited to 
cast his ballot for the national liberal party 
until december i was convinced that neither i nor my children 
would ever take part in free elections said aurel who voted in 
the 1937 elections 
up to 3000 anticommunist demonstrators gathered in bucharests 
university square where a roundtheclock protest has gone on for 
weeks to demand the ouster of iliescu and other former communists 
from the government 
we hoped iliescu would have a greater opposition said dan 
trandafirescu a 33yearold engineer 
opposition parties have called iliescu a neocommunist who 
would merely continue the old system under a new name iliescu says 
he wants to lead the country toward social democracy 
although the preelection campaign occasionally turned violent 
no major incidents were reported sunday

monies given directly to mormon missionaries 
by the churchs members are not deductible donations under federal 
tax law the supreme court ruled unanimously today 
the court said congress did not intend to make such direct 
contributions taxdeductible 
ruling against an idaho couple who were denied the tax 
deductions for subsidizing their two sons missionary service the 
justices resolved conflicting federal appeals court rulings that 
allowed such tax deductions in six states and banned them in nine 
states 
writing for the court justice sandra day oconnor said that 
under federal tax law a taxpayer may claim a deduction for a 
charitable contribution only if the contribution is made to or for 
the use of a qualified organization 
giving money directly to a church missionary is not a 
contribution to or for the use of the church under federal tax 
law oconnor said 
she said such contributions could qualify as taxdeductible if 
held in a legally enforceable trust for the qualified 
organization or in a similar legal arrangement 
the decision is a defeat for harold and enid davis of idaho 
falls 
they had been represented before the high court by rex lee 
former us solicitor general and now president of brigham young 
university 
the couple spent about 7600 subsidizing their son benjamins 
missionary work in new york city in 198081 and about 1500 for 
their son cecils missionary work in new zealand in 1981 
money was deposited into each sons bank account and the 
subsidies for neither son exceeded amounts set by the church of 
jesus christ of latterday saints 
the davises made the deduction claims belatedly unsuccessfully 
seeking refunds of 177971 and 261310 respectively for the 
two years 
the bush administration although contending that lower court 
rulings against the davises should be upheld had urged the 
justices to review the case 
government lawyers noted that 36000 mormon missionaries 
currently are serving the church 
the case is davis vs us 8998

promoscow forces in estonia stopped work today at 
several factories to protest the republics independence drive but 
the strikes were not widespread spokesmen said 
there are no obvious strikes going on currently in tallinn 
estonian government spokesman juhan hindov said from the capital 
but artur kopytyn a spokesman for the russian strike committee 
in tallinn said 15 large plants were fully on strike and limited 
work stoppages were reported at dozens of others 
journalist tarmu tammerk disputed those figures however he 
said that at an electrical and technological facility kopytyn said 
was on strike the employees voted to continue working 
these plants are not vital for everyday life said tammerk 
editor of the weekly estonian independent they are not 
integrated into the estonian economy they could be on strike every 
day with no effect 
the work stoppage made no visible impact on tallinn he said 
hindov said pressure for the strikes was coming from promoscow 
administrators at the factories and from the russian strike 
committee but people do not want to strike 
sixtyfive percent of the republics 18 million population is 
estonian russians comprise 28 percent with ukrainians and 
byelorussians making up the rest 
in the breakaway republic of lithuania lawmakers who rejected 
mikhail s gorbachevs call to suspend their march 11 declaration 
of independence met in committees today to consider a counteroffer 
a spokesman for the legislature said 
the promoscow forces in estonia and latvia have stepped up 
their activities in the week since gorbachev branded the secession 
campaigns in those republics unconstitutional 
on sunday in the latvian capital of riga 1193 promoscow 
delegates representing cities and rural areas gathered to form the 
committee for the defense of the constitution and the rights of 
citizens of the ussr the tass news agency reported 
the group mostly russians and other ethnic minorities in the 
republic said the latvian parliament did not have the legal 
authority to declare independence earlier this month tass said 
it also criticized leaders of the proindependence peoples 
front as not living up to their words concerning the equality of 
all people russians and other minorities in all three baltic 
republics complain that they are discriminated against as a result 
of the independence movements 
we have been brought together by our common concern about the 
fate of soviet power in latvia said alfred rubiks first 
secretary of the communist party in the republic he said the 
promoscow communist party would step up its activity in the 
coming days 
according to tass the committees aims include ensuring the 
operation of the soviet constitution and the laws of the ussr 
and latvia to ensure social and legal protection of residents and 
to consolidate social and political forces recognizing the 
peoples socialist choice and intending to renew socialism and the 
soviet federation 
gorbachev imposed an economic embargo on lithuania following its 
declaration of independence and on may 14 he decreed that latvias 
and estonias steps toward independence violated the constitution 
he has not taken any punitive actions against those two republics 
last tuesday promoscow forces in latvia and estonia tried to 
enter the parliament buildings of both republics but they were 
turned back by police and proindependence crowds 
gorbachevs embargo on lithuania in effect for more than a 
month has cut off all supplies of oil to the republic and nearly 
all supplies of natural gas and has reduced supplies of other key 
raw materials thousands of people have been laid off as a result 
over the weekend lithuanian lawmakers agreed to reject 
gorbachevs demand that they suspend their declaration of 
independence because it would mean accepting soviet control over 
lithuania said legislator zigmas vaisvilas 
parliament ordered a committee to work out other compromise 
proposals to offer moscow he said lawmakers were following the 
advice of lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene who met 
with gorbachev thursday night in moscow 
the soviet presidents meeting with mrs prunskiene ended a 
twomonth refusal to talk with the lithuanians and came after the 
republic offered to suspend laws implementing independence in 
exchange for negotiations 
in meeting mrs prunskiene gorbachev may have been influenced 
by the fact that she planned to meet the following day with us 
secretary of state james a baker iii baker was in moscow setting 
the agenda for the superpower summit at the end of may 
its very clear gorbachev wanted to show president bush before 
the summit that he has started negotiations and he is not 
demanding the same things as in the beginning vailvilas said

the supreme court today upheld a law requiring 
people convicted of federal crimes to pay money into a fund to help 
crime victims 
the court unanimously rejected arguments that the law is 
unconstitutional because it originated in the senate and not in 
the house of representatives 
the constitution states that all revenueraising bills shall 
originate in the house of representatives but the court relying 
on an 1897 decision today said the victims of crime act of 1984 is 
not a revenueraising measure 
the law is aimed at generating money to offset the costs of 
helping crime victims by imposing special assessments against 
convicted criminals 
justice thurgood marshall invoked the 1897 decision in stating 
a statute that creates a particular governmental program and that 
raises revenue to suppport that program as opposed to a statute 
that raises revenue to support government generally is not a bill 
for raising revenue within the meaning of the constitutions 
origination clause 
the case stemmed from a 50 assessment against a man named 
german munozflores who was convicted of helping an illegal alien 
evade inspection by immigration officials in san diego county 
calif five years ago 
munozflores was placed on probation for two years 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals overturned the assessment 
agreeing with arguments that the law was a revenueraising measure 
enacted improperly by congress 
todays decision reversed the 9th circuit courts ruling 
the ruling is a victory for the bush administration even though 
the justices rejected its argument that the case presented a 
political question federal courts should avoid 
the government may be right that a judicial finding that 
congress has passed an unconstitutional law might in some sense be 
said to entail a lack of respect for congress judgment marshall 
said 
but disrespect in the sense the government uses the term 
cannot be sufficient to create a political question he said 
if it were every judicial resolution of a constitutional 
challenge to a congressional enactment would be impermissible 
the case is us vs munozflores 881932

president bush is vowing to keep pushing 
for agreement with moscow on a treaty to reduce conventional forces 
in europe while hailing dramatic progress in other arms talks 
in the arms control area theres been some progress there 
still remain some other problems bush said after breakthroughs 
were announced over the weekend in negotiations to limit chemical 
weapons and longrange nuclear missiles 
bush said that despite the current impasse on cutting troops 
and tanks in europe he still hopes that a 35nation treaty setting 
reduced conventional force levels throughout europe can be signed 
by years end 
the president today was completing a fourday speaking tour with 
republican fundraising appearances in portland and in los angeles 
at todays republican fundraiser for oregon attorney general 
david frohnmayer called for a balancing economic concerns with 
environmental priorities 
his remarks did not appear likely to win praise from 
environmentalists who have been battling timber interests here 
over the status of the spotted owl 
his administration must decide by june 23 whether to designate 
the owl as an endangered species to do so would close off vast 
tracts of oregon forest to lumbering activities 
common sense tells us to find a needed balance bush said 
i reject those who would ignore the economic consequences of the 
spotted owl decision 
the jobs of many thousands of oregonians and whole communities 
are at stake he said 
about 150 to 200 people demonstrated outside the hotel where 
bush spoke burning american flags and newspapers and setting off 
smoke bombs several were arrested 
he flew to portland on sunday afternoon to speak at a ceremony 
dedicating a planned memorial to slain police officers 
speaking with reporters on air force one bush said he was 
pleased with the outcome of secretary of state james a baker iiis 
fourday negotiating session in moscow 
baker brought home an agreement to end chemical weapons 
production and reported major progress on a longsought treaty to 
limit strategic nuclear weapons bush and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev are expected to act on both measures at their may 31june 
3 summit in washington 
im satisfied with the progress made in moscow that well have 
a good summit bush said 
however he tempered his remarks by noting a lack of progress on 
an agreement to reduce troops tanks and other nonnuclear arms in 
europe 
weve got to get that done bush said of the conventional 
force reduction treaty until its totally finished weve got to 
stay in close consultation with the soviets 
this is important not only to us but to all of europe he 
said 
bush had predicted a year ago that the agreement would take six 
months to a year to complete the stalemate raised the likelihood 
that an agreement would not be ready to be signed even in a 
preliminary form at the upcoming superpower summit 
asked if a conventional arms limitation treaty is still possible 
this year bush said oh sure sure 
the soviets apparently are reluctant to scale back their forces 
in central europe to 195000 unless the german army is sharply 
reduced as well impending prospects of a reunified germany 
apparently are increasing soviet resistance to the troop cutback 
national security adviser brent scowcroft told reporters earlier 
that the soviets are now stonewalling on a conventional arms 
treaty 
bush said he had talked to baker on sunday and that the 
secretary of state was generally upbeat although he added 
obviously there are some things we still have to work out 
the president said other ussoviet differences were sure to be 
aired at the summit including longfestering disputes over cuba 
and afghanistan 
bush also cited differences over german unification nobody 
thought it would be easy so were just plugging away on a wide 
array of agenda items he said 
bush declined to clarify conflicting reports about what baker 
told lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene while in 
moscow us officials with baker denied statements by some sources 
that he had urged the lithuanians to suspend their declaration of 
independence from the soviet union 
bush used his speech at the portland police memorial ceremony on 
sunday to accuse the democraticled congress of watering down his 
proposed anticrime package the legislation is scheduled for 
debate in the senate this week 
for the past year its gathered dust in the house and spawned 
weak imitations in the senate bush said this country deserves 
better 
his bill calls for expanded use of the death penalty and relaxed 
rules on what police can do in gathering evidence the senate 
version includes a proposed ban on the manufacture of 
semiautomatic assault rifles which the administration opposes 
bush also joined the debate over the northern spotted owl 
saying the jobs of timberrelated workers must be considered before 
forests are cordoned off to protect the owl 
theres a lot of people whos livelihood is threatened out 
here weve got to be concerned about the human equation as 
well as the environmental equation bush said

states may impose labeling and reporting 
requirements on liquor sold at us military bases within their 
borders the supreme court ruled today 
the court said north dakotas regulation of liquor sold at two 
military bases there does not violate a clause of the constitution 
which generally gives federal policy priority over state 
regulations 
north dakota requires that all liquor sold in the state be 
distributed through a statecontrolled system 
the state said outofstate liquor distributors must put a label 
on each bottle sold at the grand forks and minot air force bases 
stating that the liquor is for consumption only at the military 
installations 
the state also said suppliers must report monthly on how much 
liquor they shipped into the state 
the high court upheld the labeling regulation by a 54 vote and 
the reporting rule 90 
justice john paul stevens in the courts main opinion said 
both regulations are valid under the 21st amendment to the 
constitution which repealed prohibition and gave states sweeping 
power over liquor distribution 
stevens said the rules serve the states legitimate interest in 
preventing diversion of liquor from military bases into the 
civilian market 
he was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
byron r white and sandra day oconnor 
justice antonin scalia voted to uphold both regulations but for 
different reasons he expressed in a separate concurring opinion 
voting to uphold north dakotas reporting regulation but strike 
down the labeling requirement were justices william j brennan 
thurgood marshall harry a blackmun and anthony m kennedy 
federal officials challenged north dakotas liquor regulation 
system on grounds it violates a federal policy aimed at assuring 
liquor sold at clubs and stores on military bases would be purchaed 
by the government at the lowest possible price profits from the 
military base sales are used to pay for recreational activities 
federal officials said it could cost the government 200000 to 
250000 more each year if they are forced to abide by north 
dakotas rules 
they said the regulations will force them to purchase more 
liquor from north dakota distributors at higher prices 
todays ruling overturns a 1988 decision by the 8th us circuit 
court of appeals 
the national beer wholesalers association supported north 
dakotas appeal saying the state has good reason to be concerned 
about diversion of liquor from military bases 
the case is north dakota vs us 88926

two championship caliber golf courses in 
scottsdale ariz produce revenues for the city local business 
and the professional golf tour leaving only the landowner without 
a dime 
the landlord is the federal government 
the interior departments bureau of reclamation had the option 
of investing money to help turn a desert into golf courses and 
cutting itself in on subsequent revenues 
the bureau chose not to invest instead simply leasing the land 
free to the city 
scottsdale then built the courses and hired a subsidiary of the 
profitmaking pga tour to run them the city gets a percentage of 
the course fees and sales the pga makes a profit the us 
government which has the land as a flood control project gets 
nothing 
the deal doesnt look like a hole in one to rep mike synar 
dokla whose house government operations environment subcommittee 
is investigating the arrangement and plans to hold a hearing this 
summer 
it begs the question of whether they had any common sense and 
whether they had any vision synar said of the federal lease 
negotiators if people in the private sector did these kind of 
deals theyd be fired 
bureau of reclamation officials said their purpose was to turn 
the area into a public recreation project and avoid maintenance 
costs 
if we had to do it again we would look at the revenue issue a 
lot more in depth said bob michaels a bureau recreational 
resource specialist in phoenix who helped negotiate the lease 
city officials had a similar purpose in avoiding maintenance 
costs but still arranged to benefit from course revenues and 
their vision didnt stop with the golf courses 
scottsdale allowed a resort the princess to be built next door 
on nonfederal land the citys room tax on the resort brings in 
additional revenue the princess also generates business for the 
courses 17 percent of the tee times are reserved for its guests 
of the two courses the stadium course is site of the phoenix 
open each january and everyday players pay 75 in fees to use the 
facility during the peak winter season the adjoining desert course 
charges 16 in the winter to allow use by players of average 
financial means 
the courses are on 180 acres within the paradise valley flood 
detention basin of the central arizona project a canal that brings 
colorado river water to about 60 communities the property is a 
vital holding basin to protect the canal in case of a flood 
bureau of reclamation officials note that they made the land 
available for recreation avoided 300000 in annual maintenance 
costs and still preserved the acreage for flood protection 
the bureau gave scottsdale which adjoins phoenix a free 
50year lease in june 1985 
carder hunt assistant to scottsdales city manager said the 
city spent 18 million 13 million from bond issues to develop 
the courses which opened in 1987 
the bureau of reclamation is allowed to invest up to 50 percent 
of the cost of adapting water project land for recreational use 
the bureau can then cut itself into any revenue arrangement from 
the recreation facility 
at that time the issue of revenue generating capacity never 
came up to the degree it does today said michaels the bureaus 
lease negotiator 
we didnt know the resort would come in and that the phoenix 
open would come in there at the time we knew the thing could 
probably carry itself but we didnt go into an economic 
analysis he said i guess we didnt go quite far enough we 
didnt examine the issue of large revenues 
judy weiss special projects manager in scottsdales community 
services department said city officials made it clear during 
negotiations that it needed a package deal that would include two 
highcaliber golf courses and a resort 
reclamation bureau spokesman bob walsh in phoenix said the 
agency saves its investments for projects that draw from a 
diverse and large geographical area 
the golf courses he said will get some outofstate traffic 
but by and large it will be from the local community 
but bill reid the general manager of the courses estimated 
half of the more than 130000 golfers at the facilities each year 
are from out of town 
hunt said the phoenix open drew 350000 spectators in january 
pumping an estimated 13 million into the phoenixscottsdale 
economy scottsdale expects that combined revenues it receives from 
the courses and the resort will exceed the citys annual bond debt 
beginning in 1992 
the citys cut of sales and fees at the courses generated 
485000 in 1989 scottsdale only retained 100000 however the 
rest went to the tournament players club under a temporary 
arrangement to repay the club for money loaned during construction

at 4000 rubles 6480 more than twice what he is currently

about one in every four iowans owns a 
pair of bib overalls which apparently are a hot fashion item among 
some younger people 
honest 
this news comes from the wacky folks at the iowa poll who 
previously have revealed how many iowans own lawn ornaments 24 
percent believe there is life on other planets 43 percent and 
believe that its not the heat its the humidity 87 percent 
the latest finding published in the des moines register on 
sunday is that 28 percent of adult iowans own a pair of bib 
overalls furthermore the denim outfits are favored about equally 
by young women male baby boomers and farmers 
forty percent of the women aged 18 to 24 own a pair but only 20 
percent of the men in that age group that figure increases to 39 
percent for men 2544 the survey found 
fortyone percent of the states male farmers wear bib overalls 
and 45 percent of the male bluecollar workers own a pair 
according to the poll 
bib overalls have been around since 1895 and originally were 
worn mostly by men and that remains true among older iowans the 
poll found that 37 percent of the iowa men 65 and older have bib 
overalls but only 11 percent of the women in that group 
although popular among young iowans bibs arent about to push 
izod and ralph lauren off department store clothing racks the poll 
shows bibs remain more popular in rural areas and small towns than 
in large cities and they are least popular with whitecollar 
workers and college graduates 
the polls figures were based on interviews with 811 iowans 
selected at random it has a margin of error of plus or minus 34 
percentage points

east german shops slashed prices on 
everything from televisions to sportswear today in a move to 
compete with a flood of western products 
the government announced the price cuts just six weeks before 
east germany is to implement a free market and merge its economy 
with west germany a major step toward uniting the nations 
parliament met in east berlin to debate a proposed treaty that 
would merge the economies and social institutions of the german 
states by july 2 hundreds of farmers driving tractors and trucks 
left nearby potsdam for a protest during the legislative session 
east german farmers want protection from west european food 
imports which are better packaged and often cheaper than east 
german goods because of european economic community subsidies 
in the west german capital of bonn the main opposition party 
rejected the economic merger proposal at it now stands and demanded 
better terms for east germany 
the position of the social democrats could mean trouble for the 
treaty since the party has control of the west german parliaments 
upper house 
party leader hansjochen vogel said the treaty falls short of 
helping create modern and qualified jobs for east germans and 
guarding against the collapse of east german businesses 
the treaty was signed friday by the east german and west german 
governments but still must be approved by the nations parliaments 
the social democrats control the west german bundesrat and they 
could delay approval if their demands are not met 
vogel said his partys actions will depend on answers to our 
demands 
in east berlin lines of consumers formed outside clothing 
furniture and electronic stores as dramatically reduced prices went 
into effect 
the east german commerce and tourism ministry said the price 
cuts would average about 60 percent on a variety of consumer goods 
according to a report by the government news agency adn 
television prices dropped from about 1818 to about 780 the 
moves were aimed at competing with the huge influx of western 
products flooding into east germany 
even though economic union is not scheduled until july 2 the 
date which western businesses can legally begin operating 
independently in the country many foreign firms already have begun 
joint ventures with east german interests 
the joint ventures often amount to little more than using an 
east german storefront or hotel room 
herman pflaum head of the east german government commission on 
joint ventures said 1145 were in effect in east germany by late 
april 90 percent of them involving west german firms 
western food products also are increasingly appearing on east 
german store shelves 
east germans began buying western goods in november when the 
former communist government was forced to open the borders in the 
face of a massive revolt 
the effect has been a steady increase in joblessness and worker 
unrest shoe industry workers have staged frequent strikes to 
protest what they say is the loss of their market to western 
competitors 
that industry last week was the first to announce drastic price 
cuts to compete 
although eastern goods especially food often are cheaper than 
westernmade goods quality is often much poorer 
many of east germanys state factories and enterprises are 
expected to shut down when they are forced to compete in a free 
market hundreds of thousands of workers are expected to lose their 
jobs

bridges and swept up cars and people 
residents had to be rescued from their roofs after their homes 
were swamped by nearly 13 inches of rain in the 24 hours ending 
sunday morning several people rescued from cars were taken to 
hospitals with minor injuries 
a wall of water just came in and everything was just floating 
around said bill goodwin who owns a souvenir store in the 
resort city even the fixtures they just turned over and 
floated 
goodwin said he watched a floating compact car crash through a 
window jerry chambliss who runs an art gallery said a woman was 
washed out of a bathhouse and down a street but grabbed a sign at 
the end of the block 
we couldnt get to her and we told her to hang on he said 
she was hollering and screaming then this guy came by in a 
frontend loader and just scooped her up 
a 90yearold landmark iron bridge in malvern on the ouachita 
river was washed away eight other bridges in the hot springs area 
were washed out 
it was like the colorado rapids chambliss said i 
expected a raft to come by there were these big waves ive never 
seen anything so frightening in my 42 years 
the national weather service issued severe thunderstorm warnings 
overnight for parts of oklahoma and arkansas including hot 
springs but flash flood warnings were not posted 
early today southeastern oklahoma was blasted with 50 mph winds 
and hail stones nearly as big as golf balls but flood levels in 
two affected rivers were expected to begin dropping by afternoon 
officials said 
in indiana residents in petersburg and boonville suffered the 
irony of having no fresh water despite the storms because raging 
torrents broke water mains 
today only about 60 homes in the boonville water system 
remained without water but petersburg residents faced a water 
crisis that could last 10 days officials said 
meanwhile local authorities in southern indiana were preparing 
for inspections this week by the federal emergency management 
agency which will determine whether home and business owners are 
eligible for lowinterest federal loans 
elsewhere farmers in central louisiana who erected levees to 
hold back the bloated red river were warned to expect even higher 
water next month 
in the southeastern texas town of coldspring wayne pady and his 
wife debbie turned their hilltop home into a shelter feeding and 
housing about 20 people forced to flee high water from lake 
livingston 
i had just purchased a house on top of a hill so we just had 
everyone down there come up here pady said the 39yearold is 
disabled by back problems from a 1985 car accident and his only 
income is social security 
everybody helps one another down here said charlie bell 
wright 60 whose husband and daughter were staying with the padys 
they try to share what theyve got you dont find many people 
like this in other places 
flooding in the region along the arkansas trinity and red 
rivers has caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and 
killed 13 people in the past three weeks in texas arkansas 
oklahoma and louisiana 
floods eased in missouri kansas illinois and indiana at least 
two people died in illinois and authorities searched for a woman 
missing in flooding near jefferson city mo since thursday

tevin campbell says he doesnt feel like a 
superstar but the 13yearold still has plenty of time to acquire 
the feeling 
music critics liken his soulful voice to that of a young michael 
jackson and tevin has been swarmed by the media since he sang on 
quincy jones back on the block album 
tevins fan club has also started to grow because of recent 
layouts in teen magazines and television performances on programs 
such as the arsenio hall show 
people come up and ask me for my autograph but i dont feel 
like a superstar tevin told the dallas times herald during a 
recent interview at his suburban dallas home i guess it hasnt 
caught up with me yet 
his ballad tomorrow has been climbing the charts since it 
was released last month as a single from jones album but tevi 
still acts like a typical teenager wearing torn blue jeans 
shopping at the mall and teasing his siblings 
the first time i heard it on the radio i didnt believe it 
was me he said now its getting kind of regular to me

the widely used acne drug accutane appears to 
signficantly block the growth of new tumors in people being treated 
for smokingrelated cancer of the mouth and throat according to a 
study released monday 
although doctors can often initially remove all signs of this 
cancer with surgery and radiation patients face a high risk of 
recurring tumors elsewhere in their throat and lungs 
the new research suggests that accutane an artificial form of 
vitamin a can prevent the development of these second tumors 
perhaps by halting the progression of smokingrelated injury to the 
body 
this is a very promising lead said dr waun k hong it 
has the potential to prevent second cancers 
hong now a physician at the md anderson cancer center in 
houston began the study in 1983 while at the veterans 
administration hospital in boston he presented his results at the 
annual meeting of the american society clinical oncology 
i think this stuff is great said dr bruce cheson of the 
national cancer institute if we can do this prevent second 
cancers it will be a major service 
cancers of the head neck esophagus and lungs account for 
almost onethird of the 510000 cancer deaths expected in the 
united states this year 
in his study hong gave accutane to 49 patients in whom doctors 
had removed all outward signs of cancer another 51 people took 
dummy placebos 
during three years of follow up two of the accutane patients 
or 4 percent developed second cancers compared with 12 patients 
or 24 percent in the comparison group 
both of the accutane patients had a single recurring tumor 
while four of the 12 placebo patients had multiple second cancers 
patients took high doses of accutane and this turned out to be 
a drawback because many suffered unpleasant side effects these 
included dry skin chapped lips and eye inflammation the problems 
were so severe that 14 of the patients did not finished the 
yearlong course of treatment 
some people said doc i just cant take it my face is so 
red that people think im drinking hong said 
because of the side effects hong said he does not recommend the 
drug for routine use in these cancer patients he said new studies 
will be necessary to see if lower doses will cause fewer problems 
yet still prevent recurring cancers 
accutane known technically as 13cis retinoic acid can also 
cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy 
dr roger foster of the university of vermont said that despite 
the drawbacks the interesting thing is that there has been a 
demonstration of a preventative agent 
dr edith mitchell of the university of missouri in columbia 
added its a big deal but we need to find the minimal dose that 
patients can tolerate 
hong also cautioned that although the drug appears to prevent 
the development of second tumors it does not stop the cancer from 
coming back in the site where it was initially treated the study 
was too small to determine whether it helped patients live longer 
hong theorized that it works by suppressing precancerous 
abnormalities in the bodys air passageways 
he said this approach also raises the possibility that drugs may 
someday be able to prevent a first cancer in people who are at high 
risk because of a lifetime of exposure to tobacco smoke but even 
if this can be done it should not be an excuse to keep smoking 
it would be very dangerous for smokers to think they can take 
a pill instead of giving up smoking he said 
hong said he hopes to study less toxic forms of vitamin a which 
may be more tolerable for longterm use

ratings the other casualties capital news the marshall 
chronicles help and sunset beat 
abc renewed china beach life goes on 
thirtysomething roseanne and abc news primetime live

but the cancellations included anything but love and 
saturdays abc mystery movie quartet that had new versions of 
yesteryears kojak and columbo 
abc put six new series on its fall roster 
three are sitcoms baby talk based on the hit movie look 
whos talking going places about four young adults in los 
angeles working on their first tv show a candid videos 
series and married people about three generations of married 
couples sharing the same building 
capitalizing on its toprated americas funniest home 
videos abc also will have americas funniest part ii 
the two onehour shows are steven bochcos cop rock a blend 
of music and police drama and gabriels fire starring james 
earl jones as a former convictturnedprivate investigator 
whether abc would renew twin peaks a continuing saga of 
sex murder and jelly doughnuts set in a small logging town in the 
pacific northwest had caused some suspense but not as much as 
who killed laura palmer 
shes the high school homecoming queen whose body was found at 
the start of the shows premiere although abc wont give critics 
an advance look at the seasons eighth and final episode this 
month the segment is expected to resolve her murder 
the series has been shown on thursdays but the final episode 
was moved to wednesday to add its numbers to those abc will get for 
the may ratings sweeps which end wednesday night the sweeps 
period helps determine advertising rates for local stations 
preceded by heavy publicity and generally favorable reviews the 
twohour premiere of twin peaks on april 8 got the highest 
ratings of any twohour movie aired last season according to abc

its time period 
but the show steadily lost viewers during the next six episodes 
that abc aired opposite nbcs toprated cheers 
abc officials werent immediately available to discuss why they 
renewed the show but industry observers said the network likely 
would pick up the series because it is attracting a female audience 
desirable to advertisers and it eventually might get a larger 
general audience 
although wednesdays episode could get high ratings because of 
the murder mystery involved last thursdays show had a viewing 
audience 51 percent smaller than for the premiere the show gave 
twin peaks its lowest ratings to date a 106 rating and a 17 
percent audience share 
each ratings point represents 921000 homes

urban educators concerned that their students 
will be overlooked in a national effort to improve education formed 
a task force monday aimed specifically at problems facing big city 
schools 
over the last five years numerous reports have been written 
about the condition of urban education in this country said 
joseph fernandez chancellor of new york city schools 
while many of these reports contain excellent recommendations 
it is critical that the practitioners those impacted most by the 
recommendations become involved in discussions of our national 
education agenda fernandez said 
holmes braddock presidentelect of the council of the great 
city schools said the task force would develop its plan within 
three years 
urban schools he said have heavy concentrations of minorities 
or nonenglish speaking children as well as lowachievers and 
lowincome students other problems include crumbling facilities 
and inadequate teaching materials 
fernandez will head the group which will analyze goals that 
include increasing expectations for all urban school students and 
adequately staffing urban schools with qualified teachers who are 
culturally and racially sensitive and who reflect the racial 
characteristics of their students 
the task force also will review ways to restructure education in 
urban areas and discuss controversial ideas such as eliminating 
grading and testing from kindergarten through third grade 
lengthening school days team teaching and increased federal 
financial commitment 
fernandez said the task force would seek bottom up 
approaches as opposed to the top down scenario offered by the 
nations governors a final report on the urban goals will be 
completed by jan 15 1991 
the national education goals approved by president bush and the 
governors in february are targeted for 2000 
those goals say all children will start school ready to learn 
high school graduation rates will increase to at least 90 percent 
american students will be first in the world in mathematics and 
science students will leave grades four eight and 12 competent in 
basic subjects every american adult will be literate and every 
school free of violence and drugs 
the council of the great city schools is a coalition of 45 of 
the nations largest urban school districts

the supreme court today allowed a permanent 
ban on demonstrations by an antiabortion group that blocked access 
to abortion clinics in new york it was th second legal setback in 
two weeks for operation rescue 
the justices without comment let stand a federal judges order 
that forbids operation rescue members from blocking women trying to 
enter new york area abortion clinics 
operation rescue members are under similar injunctions in other 
cities 
todays action came a week after the high court by a 54 vote 
left intact a similar ban on operation rescue blockades at abortion 
clinics in atlanta 
but todays action is a bigger setback for operation rescue 
the courts order in the atlanta case was preliminary in nature 
the dispute had reached the justices as a request for emergency 
help before georgia courts had finished studying the controversy 
the four justices who voted to allow demonstrations in atlanta 
said freespeech restrictions should not have been imposed before 
georgia courts had a chance to rule definitively 
today the high court rejected a formal appeal by operation 
rescue after lower courts ruled definitively against the group in 
the new york case 
and in contrast to the atlanta case there were no dissenting 
votes today 
randall terry founder of operation rescue said in a statement 
about the ruling no court can prohibit us from rescuing babies 
these judges have joined the heritage of nazi judges who sanctioned 
the murder of the innocent the day of judgment will hold 
terrifying consequences for them 
in other action the court 
upheld a law requiring people convicted of federal crimes to 
pay money into a fund to help crime victims 
the court unanimously rejected arguments that the law is 
unconstitutional because it originated in the senate and not in 
the house of representatives 
rejected an appeal by a company accused of illegal bias for 
refusing to hire as a truck driver a navajo indian who used peyote 
in religious ceremonies 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the company 
engaged in illegal discrimination even though it offered to hire 
the man after he complained to new mexico officials 
ruled unanimously that defendants can be required to make 
restitution only for specific crimes of which they are convicted 
not related alleged offenses 
the justices said a former post office worker in texas is not 
required to pay a bank 90431 he allegedly stole through credit 
card fraud 
bolstered the federal governments power to control water used 
by hydroelectric dams 
voting 90 the court struck down california regulations aimed 
at assuring survival of trout in the american river and rock creek 
a small tributary of the river 
justice sandra day oconnor writing for the court said the 
federal power act preempts californias streamflow regulations 
ruled unanimously that monies given directly to mormon 
missionaries by the churchs members are not deductible donations 
under federal tax law 
the court said congress did not intend to make such direct 
contributions taxdeductible 
in the abortion case the national organization for women and 
other abortion rights advocates sued operation rescue and terry in 
a new york state court in 1988 
the suit seeking an end to the groups blockades alleged 
violations of several state laws and one federal law the ku klux 
klan act 
operation rescues lawyers had the case transferred to federal 
court where us district judge robert j ward in early 1989 
permanently enjoined the abortion clinic demonstrations 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last sept 20 upheld 
wards injunction and became the nations first federal appeals 
court to rule that operation rescues tactics violate womens civil 
rights and are not a type of protected free speech 
the groups members were trespassers without right 
constitutional or otherwise the appeals court said there is 
no constitutional privilege to assault or harass an individual or 
to invade anothers personal space 
among other things the appeals court said the operation rescue 
demonstrators had violated the ku klux klan acts ban on 
conspiracies which violate the rights of a class of persons 
acknowledging that the civil war era law was aimed primarily at 
protecting newly freed slaves the appeals court said the law is 
necessarily tied to evolving notions of equality and citizenship 
as conspiracies directed against women are inherently 
invidious and repugnant to the notion of equality for all citizens 
they are therefore encompassed under the act the 2nd circuit 
court ruled 
rejecting operation rescues freespeech arguments the appeals 
court said blocking access to public and private buildings has 
never been upheld as a proper method of communication in an orderly 
society 
the appeals court upheld a 50000 contemptofcourt fine issued 
against operation rescue and terry but it ordered that the fine be 
paid to the us treasury not to the abortion rights advocates who

the supreme court refused monday to let an 
antiabortion group block the entrances to abortion clinics in new 
york it was the second high court setback in two weeks for 
operation rescue 
the justices action was praised by abortionrights advocates 
and denounced by operation rescue founder randall terry the court 
left intact an order in which a federal judge permanently banned 
the groups members from interfering with women entering new 
yorkarea abortion clinics 
operation rescue members are under similar injunctions in other 
cities 
its a tremendous victory said bill baird who runs two 
long island clinics where demonstrations have occurred repeatedly 
id like to see the courts go further and assign federal marshals 
to escort women in just as they escorted blacks into buildings in 
the 1960s he said 
terry in a statement released from operation rescues office in 
binghamton ny said no court can prohibit us from rescuing 
babies these judges have joined the heritage of nazi judges who 
sanctioned the murders of the innocent 
the justices took mondays action not a formal ruling but a 
denial of operation rescues appeal without comment and without 
any recorded dissenting vote 
just last week the court voted 54 to leave intact a similar 
ban on operation rescue blockades at abortion clinics in atlanta 
but mondays action was a bigger setback for operation rescue 
the courts order in the atlanta case was preliminary in nature 
the dispute had reached the justices as a request for emergency 
help before georgia courts had finished studying the controversy 
the four justices who voted to allow demonstrations in atlanta 
said freespeech restrictions should not have been imposed before 
the state courts had a chance to rule definitively 
the high court monday rejected a formal appeal by operation 
rescue after lower courts ruled definitively against the group in 
the new york case 
the national organization for women and other abortionrights 
advocates sued operation rescue and terry in a new york state court 
in 1988 
its a humdinger couldnt be better said now president 
molly yard they were breaking the law she said adding that 
her organization is ready to seek court injunctions anywhere 
operation rescue members try to bar access to clinics 
the suit seeking an end to the groups blockades alleged 
violations of several state laws and one federal law the ku klux 
klan act 
operation rescues lawyers had the case transferred to federal 
court where us district judge robert j ward in early 1989 
permanently enjoined the demonstrators 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last sept 20 upheld 
wards injunction and became the nations first federal appeals 
court to rule that operation rescues tactics violate womens civil 
rights and are not a type of protected free speech 
the appeals court said the operation rescue demonstrators had 
violated the ku klux klan acts ban on conspiracies that violate 
the rights of a class of persons 
acknowledging that the civil warera law was aimed primarily at 
protecting newly freed slaves the appeals court said the law is 
necessarily tied to evolving notions of equality and citizenship 
as conspiracies directed against women are inherently 
invidious and repugnant to the notion of equality for all citizens 
they are therefore encompassed under the act the 2nd circuit 
court ruled 
in other matters monday the supreme court 
ruled unanimously in a case from idaho that mormons who 
contribute money directly to the churchs missionaries may not 
deduct those donations from their federal taxes 
enhanced the federal governments power to control water used 
by hydroelectric dams unanimously striking down californias 
regulations to protect trout in the american river and its 
tributaries 
upheld a law requiring people convicted of federal crimes to 
pay money into a fund to help crime victims the court rejected 
arguments in a case from california that the law is 
unconstitutional because it originated in the senate not the house

the army plans to introduce a bullet made of 
compressed sand as a new riot deterrent in the occupied 
territories a military spokeswoman said monday 
the sand bullet expected to be introduced in a few months is 
designed to be fired during closerange confrontations she said 
the aim is to reduce the force of impact the bullet is not 
meant to cause serious injuries but to deter the spokeswoman 
said 
israeli soldiers will continue to use plastic bullets 
rubbercoated metal pellets and live ammunition in their battle 
against the 29month palestinian uprising in the west bank and the 
gaza strip 
more than 700 palestinians have died of israeli gunfire in the 
rebellion and an additional 216 have been killed by other arabs as 
suspected proisraeli collaborators fortythree israelis also have 
been slain 
in july 1988 the army introduced plastic bullets to break up 
palestinian demonstrations with a minimum of fatalities such 
bullets are not supposed to be lethal if fired from a range of 70 
yards 
however at least 128 palestinians had been killed by plastic 
bullets as of march 2 1990 according to army figures 
neither the army nor israeli human rights groups could provide 
figures on fatalities resulting from the rubber bullets however 
several palestinians have been killed by the rubber bullets 
including the socalled improved round rubber bullets with an 
enlarged metal core

military officers in el salvador have risen to 
power despite having commanded units linked to human rights abuses 
according to a report issued monday on the eve of a congressional 
battle over cutting us military aid 
the congressional study said 14 of the countrys 15 senior 
military commanders have commanded units that are documented to 
have killed civilians tortured prisoners carried out kidnappings 
or covered up such abuses 
the promotion to senior positions of so many officers whose 
troops committed repeated abuses of human rights and the absence 
of prosecutions of even junior officers for these abuses suggest 
that at a basic level there is little accountability concluded 
the report by the arms control and foreign policy caucus 
the report underscoring the already tarnished reputation of the 
salvadoran military was issued the day before a partisan house 
floor battle over us military aid to el salvador the aid totals 
85 million this year and the bush administration wants the same 
level for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
but some democrats claim they will narrowly win a vote to slash 
the military aid in half this year and next and to impose 
conditions to pressure the government and leftist rebels to reach a 
negotiated peacemoved

more than 80 aids activists were arrested 
at the national institutes of health today during a demonstration 
calling for more aids research by government scientists 
nearly a thousand protesters draped red streamers through the 
trees outside a number of nih buildings to symbolize the red tape 
of the bureaucracy that they say is slowing down work to find a 
cure for aids 
the demonstrators moved from building to building chanting 
slogans and erecting cardboard head stones on the lawns of some of 
the buildings 
bob shriver a spokesman for the national institutes of health 
said about 60 people were arrested on trespassing charges at the 
main bethesda campus he estimated the crowd at about 900 at the 
rockville office of the director of aids research for the national 
institute of allergy and infectious diseases 21 demonstrators were 
arrested on loitering charges montgomery county police said 
police said the demonstrators had the option of paying a 50 
fine or requesting a court date all those arrested were freed 
authorities said 
mark harrington of the new yorkbased aids coalition to unleash 
power act up said the activists want nih to put more emphasis on 
drugs that fight the opportunistic infections that kill aids 
patients whose immune systems are weakened by the disease 
he said they also want more research into new antiviral drugs 
that work differently from azt azt is currently the only approved 
antiviral drug that fights the aids virus directly 
the demonstrators say government researchers have focused too 
much of their work on azt and have failed to start studies on other 
antiviral drugs since azt was approved researchers have been 
studying its effectiveness on people in different stages of the 
disease 
were just trying to get them to change the rules 
harrington said 
for years aids activists had directed their criticism at the 
food and drug administration saying health officials there were 
too slow in approving new drugs to fight the disease and the 
infections it causes 
but activists have shifted their focus to nih saying the fda 
cant approve drugs that arent there 
now were mad because approaches that are promising arent 
being pursued harrington said 
the protesters also complained that governmentsponsored studies 
have enrolled very few women blacks hispanics and drug users one 
group of women in the demonstration held up a banner that said 
women are invisible at nih

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is 
sending arms experts here later in the week to resume presummit 
negotiations to cut longrange nuclear weapons and they will find 
the bush administration in a mood to strike a deal 
the negotiators will take up a halfdozen issues that were not 
resolved by secretary of state james a baker iii last week in 
moscow the aim is to settle as many as they can before gorbachev 
arrives may 30 for summit talks with president bush 
the us strategy is to look for a tradeoff accepting the 
position taken by the soviets on some issues in exchange for their 
agreeing to the us stand on others a senior us official said 
monday he spoke on condition of anonymity 
the bush administration is not tipping its hand about its 
priorities before the talks begin wednesday or thursday at the 
state department but one of the main us objectives is to keep 
the soviets from improving their powerful ss18 nuclear missiles 
as part of the strategic arms reduction treaty the soviets 
already have agreed to reduce their arsenal of 308 of these 
landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles by 50 percent to 
154 
the bush administration would like to halt improvements in the 
missiles that will remain but is reluctant to accept curbs on its 
own arsenal of deadly multiwarhead ballistic missiles carried 
aboard nuclear submarines 
other unsettled issues include how many landbased mobile 
missiles would be allowed whether the soviet backfire bomber 
should be regulated and how to verify compliance with a start 
treaty 
another tough issue restricting nucleartipped cruise missiles 
was resolved during the four days of talks baker held in moscow 
that breakthrough involved a tradeoff baker accepted the range 
limitations proposed by the soviets on cruise missiles carried 
aboard airplanes while the soviets agreed to exclude the new us 
tacit rainbow airtosurface missile from any restraints 
also the soviets gave in to the us demand that there be no 
inspection of cruise missiles carried aboard submarines 
bakers trip also produced what he called a trailblazing 
ussoviet agreement to end the production of chemical weapons 
but with the summit only 10 days away the two sides are 
concentrating on trying to reach agreement on as many strategic 
weapons reductions as they can include in a declaration to be 
initialed by bush and gorbachev 
the soviet delegation will be headed by aleksander bessmertnykh 
a close adviser to gorbachev he is due to present his credentials 
to bush next monday as the new soviet ambassador under secretary 
of state reginald bartholomew will head the us team 
meanwhile us and soviet negotiators are continuing to work on 
the treaty in geneva the proposed text runs 400 to 500 pages even 
if all key issues are settled it will take several months at 
least to complete it 
work in vienna on another treaty to cut us and soviet troops 
tanks artillery airplanes and helicopters in europe has slowed 
down baker was unable to perk up the negotiations during his 
meetings in moscow with gorbachev and foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze 
the soviets are reluctant to pull 600000 soldiers out of 
central europe until they are assured the german army also will be 
sharply reduced 
even so the bush administration intends to go as far as it can 
in completing the start treaty 
richard boucher a state department spokesman said monday the 
administration would not delay completing one accord while the 
other lagged start can be a very important agreement he said 
the treaty would cut us and soviet strategic nuclear weapons 
by 30 percent to 35 percent overall

top of british politics with deep knowledge and insight for the 
times of london has died at 75 his former newspaper reported 
monday 
wood died friday according to the newspaper the cause of death 
was not disclosed 
his bestremembered exclusive was his disclosure on june 1 
1959 that foreign secretary selwyn lloyd had been told by prime 
minister harold macmillan that enough was enough and he would 
be transferred to another cabinet post in several months time 
the report created an international sensation because lloyd was 
then in geneva attending a presummit conference of the prime 
ministers of the socalled big four nations british french 
soviet and us and his position was undermined 
lloyd was a controversial figure because he had been foreign 
secretary during the anglofrench secret collusion with israel and 
invasion of egypt over the suez crisis in 1956 
macmillan and government information officers denied woods 
report on lloyd but it was macmillan himself who had given wood 
the information lloyd was made chancellor of the exchequer the 
following year 
later when top officials of the conservative party were 
discussing who would succeed macmillan wood reported accurately 
what was going on and ranking tories tried to have him thrown out 
of his job they were rebuffed by the late sir william haley who 
is remembered as one of the great editors of the 205yearold 
newspaper 
wood a laborers son became a reporter in his hometown of 
grantham when he was 14 he was a fast shorthand writer and in 
reporting the town council he got to know alderman alfred roberts 
whose daughter margaret is today prime minister thatcher 
in world war ii wood served in tanks in north africa and was an 
intelligence officer in france and germany he joined the times in 
1948 and was its political editor for more than 20 years 
his monday morning articles on the background of politics were 
essential reading for all legislators and notable for the fine 
quality of writing and their political insight the times obituary

latin america will gain a place of first 
importance in us foreign policy as the cold war ebbs deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger said monday 
eagleburgers statement delivered before an audience of 
corporate executives was clearly intended to reassure latin 
american leaders worried that their region will get scant attention 
in the growing us fascination with the collapse of communism in 
eastern europe 
the focus of us policy will increasingly and inevitably be 
drawn to our own hemisphere as relations with the soviet union 
improve and democracy becomes rooted in the former soviet bloc 
eagleburger said 
we may well be at the edge of removing from the us foreign 
policy agenda the tremendous concern with eastwest relations that 
has of necessity dominated the agenda for the last 45 years he 
said 
the world is clearly changing eagleburger said adding that 
the changes will clearly redound to the benefit of latin 
america 
eagleburger said it was natural for the united states to expend 
considerable energy in europe because the prospect of ending the 
cold war is of overriding stategic importance 
but he said longterm responsibility for aiding the nations of 
eastern europe in their struggle to install democratic institutions 
and revive prosperity will be borne by their west european 
neighbors 
success in ending the eastwest struggle and fostering stability 
and prosperity in europe will open a new chapter in us foreign 
policy he said 
the ending of the cold war should bring with it a 
demilitarization of foreign policy and a new set of economic and 
political challenges especially in latin america eagleburger said 
as a result of improvements in eastwest relations latin 
america is going to occupy a place of first importance in us 
foreign policy he said 
us trade with latin america will be seen as a vital national 
interest in part to promote democracy prosperity and stability 
and in part out of sheer selfinterest he said 
but it is an interest that will be increasingly threatened if 
the region remains mired in debt and unable to buy our products 
eagleburger said 
it is clear he said the united states and latin america will 
have to move to open up trade to boost us investment and the 
flow of technology and to help solve latin americas crushing debt 
problems 
statist and protectionist policies must be fully rolled 
back he said if the door is not opened wide enough 
investment will go elsewhere 
eagleburger also predicted the united states will take a a 
much more open attitude toward freetrade agreements but 
acknowleged that negotiating them country by country will be time 
consuming and difficult

record of 394 billion in may 1986 
the bush administration budget last january estimated the 1990 
deficit to be 1238 billion although officials admit it will be

to be 159 billion 
revenues last month were up 83 percent from april 1989 to

payments however fell from 1469 billion in april 1989 to 1338 
billion last month 
louis crandall chief economist for rh wrightson amp associates 
in new york said the unexpectedly large income tax receipts were 
due to payments that usually are posted in may being entered in

revenues for the first seven months of fiscal 1990 totaled 
59792 billion up 49 percent from the same period of fiscal

the supreme court today bolstered the federal 
governments power to control water used by hydroelectric dams 
voting 90 the court struck down california regulations aimed 
at assuring survival of trout in the american river and rock creek 
a small tributary of the river 
justice sandra day oconnor writing for the court said the 
federal power act preempts californias streamflow regulations 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has indicated 
that the california requirements interfere with its comprehensive 
planning authority and we agree that allowing california to impose 
the challenged requirements would be contrary to congressional 
intent oconnor said 
californias appeal was supported by all 49 other states who 
said a victory for the federal government threatened state control 
over water resources 
leading environmental groups including american rivers the 
national audubon society and the sierra club had said a victory 
for the federal government would shield illconceived hydroelectric 
development from state regulation 
ferc in 1983 licensed construction of a hydroelectric power 
project on rock creek near placerville calif 
the owner of the dam rock creek limited partnership planned to 
generate electric power to be sold to the pacific gas amp electric 
co for use by the utilitys customers 
the california water resources control board sought to limit the 
flow of water over the dam by requiring that enough water would 
continue to flow in rock creek to assure suvival of the trout 
population 
the federal agency in 1987 said it has exclusive control over 
how much water should flow over the dam 
todays ruling upheld a decision last year by the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals 
the justices relied heavily on a 1944 high court ruling that 
gave states control over water distribution only for limited 
purposes for irrigation and city water supplies 
oconnor said there has been no sufficient intervening change 
in the law or indication that the 1944 ruling has proved 
unworkable or has fostered confusion and inconsistency in the law 
that warrants our departure from established precedent 
the case is california vs ferc 89333

seven palestinians in israel meant the time had come to settle 
scores with the united states 
hussein musawi leader of a prosyrian wing of the proiranian 
hezbollah said the level of violence in the uprising in the west

soviet jewish immigrants 
on sunday an israeli shot and killed seven palestinians day 
laborers in the tel aviv suburb of rishon letzion violent protests 
broke out in the israelioccupied gaza strip and west bank in 
response 
the real retaliation to this massacre is in escalating the 
suicide attacks in the occupied territories and outside them and a 
serious settlement of accounts with the americans he said 
musawi speaking from his baalbek headquarters did not specify 
how the americans were involved or what actions would be taken he 
did not mention the 16 western hostages

release a captive last month as goodwill gesture after the april 
22 freeing of robert polhill he said the kidnappers expected 
reciprocity from the united states

commerce secretary robert mosbacher said 
thursday that us business has been too slow to take advantage of 
opportunities in an eastern european nations moving away from 
communism 
mosbacher recalled that zbigniew brzezinski who was national 
security adviser to former president carter was surprised at the 
slow pace of investment compared to the moves into spain and 
portugal when dictatorships ended in those countries 
i second dr brzezinskis statement mosbacher said spain 
and portugal have come a long way in 20 years and so have 
american businesses who went into those countries early 
in 1990 us business is on the doorstep of another historic 
opportunity and we have a truly unique advantage our nation has 
long been a symbol of hope in eastern europe not only as leader of 
the free world for the last 45 years but in centuries past 
mosbacher appeared at a seminar on business relations between 
the united states eastern europe and the soviet union that 
included stanislav v assekritov deputy chairman of the soviet 
state commission for economic reform 
the commerce secretary told assekritov he believed in soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reform efforts but he declined to 
answer a question from assekritov about prospects for a trade 
agreement 
i think we better leave that to our respective presidents 
and to the hopes the soviet union will very soon pass their 
emigration bill he said 
the united states has made a trade agreement contingent on a new 
soviet law to allow free emigration the supreme soviet may take 
the legislation up at the end of the month the soviets had hoped 
to sign the trade pact at the may 30june 3 superpower summit but 
the crackdown in lithuania may jeopardize that schedule

a former us diplomat said monday that he 
gave indonesian military authorities the names of highranking 
communists who were subsequently killed in a 1965 purge that 
terrorized the country 
robert j martens who was a political officer at the us 
embassy in jakarta said he gleaned the names of thousands of 
partai kommunis indonesia or pki activists from the media 
the same reports were available to indonesian authorities but 
martens said the officials were disorganized and didnt appear to 
have the names 
pki with 35 million members and as many as 18 million people 
affiliated with it was the largest communist party in the world 
and was active in every level of government and the military 
martens now an adviser to the state department said the pki 
was in danger of taking control of indonesia at a time when 
communists were flexing their muscle throughout asia 
the purge of the pki at the end of 1965 coincided with the start 
of us activity against the communists in vietnam 
among the names he provided were all the members of the pkis 
central committee martens said in an interview 
i thought it was the right thing to do he said i have no 
regrets 
martens said he gave names of activists in the cities and within 
the party apparatus and not in the provinces martens said he and 
other us officials were aware that indonesias military leader 
gen suharto was rounding up pki cadres and was determined to 
annihilate the party 
martens said he dealt with suharto loyalists who were opposed 
to thenpresident sukarno and his support for the left wing 
sukarno opposed the crackdown but he had lost power to such an 
extent that he effectively relinquished his post to suharto in 1966 
suharto has beens president since 1968 
martens said he made the decision to provide the names thinking 
it was standard practice to share information with host governments 
and that it wasnt a big deal 
he said he hadnt consulted with his superiors and only told 
them about it several years later 
the former deputy chief of the cia station in jakarta joseph 
lazarsky and martens boss edward masters said cia employees 
contributed to the pki lists according to a report published 
monday by states news service a small washingtonbased news 
service 
states news service reported that us officials used martens 
list to check off the names of pki members who were killed it said 
a 1968 cia report estimated the number of those killed at 250000 
cia spokesman mark mansfield denied that the agency was involved 
in the preparation or distribution of a list used to track down pki 
members 
state department spokesman richard boucher said pki leaders were 
well known to indonesian authorities 
its highly unlikely that we could have provided any 
information which was not known to the indonesian government of the 
time boucher said and of course we would not have provided 
names of people for the purposes of having them killed 
martens said the government had not put together any names 
because it was petrified by the assassination of six 
anticommunist generals the military blamed the killings on the 
pki and launched the purge that virtually destroyed the party

chrysler corp is recalling some 1987model 
jeep cherokee comanche and wagoneer models to replace catalytic 
converters that overheat and break down the environmental 
protection agency said monday 
the recalled vehicles are those built before oct 16 1986 and 
equipped with the 25liter fuelinjected engine vehicles sold in 
california which has different pollution standards than the other 
states are included in the recall 
the agency said an insulation layer between the inner and outer 
layers of the converter assembly traps too much heat damaging the 
ceramic catalyst support inside and destroying the effectiveness of 
the converter 
the problem was discovered in routine epa tests that showed the 
jeep models exceeding federal emission standards for all 
pollutants epa said 
the agency said 11056 jeep models were produced with the 
defective catalysts an unknown number of owners have replaced the 
converters under warranty and they will not receive recall notices 
the converter sits in the exhaust pipe to turn pollutants into 
harmless substances

a strike by promoscow forces in estonia failed to 
win widespread support monday when many workers ignored a call to 
walk off the job in protest of the republics independence drive 
in lithuania lawmakers put together a new offer aimed at 
breaking the republics deadlock with moscow also monday the 
presidents of estonia and latvia arrived in moscow for talks with 
kremlin officials reports said 
the three baltic republics lithuania estonia and latvia 
were forcibly annexed by the soviet union 50 years ago and all are 
in varying stages of efforts to break free of moscows control 
the contents of the proposal drafted by lithuanian lawmakers 
which must be voted on by the lithuanian legislature as a whole 
were not revealed the soviet news agency tass reported 
but tass quoted lithuanias prime minister kazimiera 
prunskiene as saying it touched on the issue of whether to back 
off on lithuanias march 11 declaration of independence 
gorbachev has demanded lawmakers suspend the declaration they 
have so far refused to comply but have offered to consider 
rescinding measures aimed at implementing the declaration 
lithuania is feeling the squeeze from the cutoff of oil natural 
gas and other raw materials imposed by moscow more than a month ago 
lithuanian parliamentary spokesman rita dapkus said monday that 
total industrial construction and transportation layoffs topped 
12100 not counting taxi and bus drivers idled by the resulting 
shortage of gasoline 
in the agricultural sector the embargo has forced the shutdown 
of 712 enterprises or 60 percent of the republics total ms 
dapkus said 
on may 14 gorbachev decreed that steps toward independence by 
latvia and estonia violated the constitution but he has not taken 
any punitive actions against those two republics 
the presidents of estonia and latvia arrived in moscow on monday 
for talks with kremlin officials the estonian news service 
reported 
estonian president arnold ruutel and latvian president anatoly 
gorbunov planned to meet tuesday with members of gorbachevs 
advisory body on the nations republics and nationalities the news 
service said 
ruutel told a news conference a private meeting with gorbachev 
was possible 
tuesdays talks would be the second session in less than a week 
between kremlin officials and baltic leaders mrs prunskiene met 
with gorbachev on thursday 
in estonia there were conflicting reports on the success of the 
antiindependence forces strike call but most accounts suggested 
the walkouts were far from crippling 
artur kopytyn of the antiindependence russian strike committee 
claimed there were strikes monday at 18 enterprises 
but estonian radio together with estonian journalist tarmu 
tammerk said stoppages hit no more than six or seven enterprises 
whose work was not vital to everyday life in the republic 
the city is calm the workday is over and there were no 
incidents tammerk said by telephone from tallinn the republics 
capital the strike seems to be a failure for today 
government spokesman juhan hindov said pressure for the strikes 
was coming from promoscow administrators at the factories and from 
the russian strike committee but people do not want to strike 
estonias prime minister edgar savisaar told estonian radio no 
more than 10 businesses were on strike and that five or six others 
would join tuesday 
were too poor to strike one burly unidentified worker 
told the evening soviet television newscast vremya which noted 
there was little support of the call to walk off the job 
kopytyn in a telephone interview said he could not say how 
many workers participated in mondays strikes but he said they 
would continue tuesday and support would be bigger and bigger and 
bigger 
he acknowledged however that bus drivers and other transport 
employees did not take part in the job action 
the agitators made all they could to call people to the 
strike said mati magi director of the tallinn bus enterprises 
but our russian drivers would not join the action 
sixtyfive percent of the republics 18 million population is 
estonian russians make up 28 percent with ukrainians and 
byelorussians making up the rest 
russians and other minorities in all three baltic republics 
complain that they are discriminated against as a result of the

a dramatic increase in wheat production this 
year will help rebuild us stockpiles and probably will mean 
stiffer regional competition for some export markets an 
agriculture department report said monday 
total wheat output has been projected at more than 269 billion 
bushels a rise of more than 650 million bushels from the 
weatherreduced 1989 harvest 
it would be the biggest yeartoyear increase on record besides 
resulting in the nations thirdlargest wheat harvest the report 
said winter wheat alone is forecast at 209 billion bushels up 44 
percent from 1989 
as a result of the larger crop lean stockpiles are expected to 
increase by june 1 1991 to about 765 million bushels from an 
estimated 442 million bushels this june 1 
wheat prices received by farmers in 199091 are forecast at 
290 to 330 per bushel down from an average of 371 in 198990 
and 372 in the 198889 marketing year 
the 199091 price relationships and competition across classes 
kinds of wheat may change dramatically from 198990 the report 
said supplies of hard red winter wheat will be up sharply 
resulting in more competition with hard red spring for the hard 
wheat market 
hard red winter wheat is concentrated in kansas and other parts 
of the central and southern great plains while hard red spring 
wheat is mostly in northern areas white wheat is grown mainly in 
the pacific northwest and soft red winter is raised in the eastern 
third of the country 
larger crops and reduced imports are expected in south asia 
the report said this will mean that the larger us white wheat 
crop will have to compete with soft red winter for export markets 
such as egypt that take both classes of wheat

the united states on monday said romanias 
first free elections since 1937 represent an important 
beginning but that the new government will have to improve the 
democratic process 
richard boucher the state departments deputy spokesman said 
election observers sent to romania by the bush administration 
reported voting was free peaceful and enthusiastic and that 
turn out was heavy with long lines at the polls 
we note that problems with voting and other election day 
irregularities appear to have been minimal although opposition 
political party leaders have complained of breaches of election law 
procedures boucher said 
we see this as an important beginning for romania he said 
but he said the election campaign itself was flawed by 
candidates lack of access to the news media and the intimidation 
of opposition candidates he said 
further improving the process of democracy will be a key task 
of whatever government emerges in romania boucher said 
boucher said there were no conclusions about possible us 
economic aid to romania because our assessment of the elections 
is only now beginning 
the first official returns in romania showed interim president 
ion iliescu a former communist with an overwhelming lead in the 
presidential race his national salvation front appeared to be 
headed for victory in the parliamentary elections which would 
allow him to govern without forming a coalition with the opposition

trinitesurmer france ap the hometown of extreme

a majority of trinitesurmers 15 municipal legislators voted

meeting of extremeright european leaders next month 
his birthplace a coastal resort of 56000 people on the 
atlantic coast joined vichy aurillac angouleme lorient and 
poitiers in turning away the chief of the antiimmigrant national 
front party 
councilors cited public objections to renting a public hall to

the council also objected to the likely presence of franz 
schoenhuber a former waffen ss soldier who heads west germanys 
farright republican party 
we have had enough of seeing our town associated with the 
image of le pen three assistant mayors declared in a joint 
statement last week we prefer the image of the sailing capital

about 400 citizens signed a petition asking the council to turn 
down the national fronts request to use the public meeting hall 
during the meeting planned june 58 
in paris the city council held a moment of silence monday in

as early returns indicated a landslide 
for the interim government bitter disappointment set in monday 
among opposition activists in the town where the december 
revolution began 
the national salvation front did not make the revolution 
they came to power because of it and now they have finally stolen 
it from the people of timisoara said gheorghe serban of the 
timisoara society a civic group formed during the uprising 
a west german exit poll of 14539 voters indicated interim 
president ion iliescu of the front would win 83 percent of the 
votes nationwide national liberal party candidate radu campeanu 
was second with 11 percent and ion ratiu of the national peasant 
party had 6 percent 
early returns appeared to confirm the sweep of the front a 
party with several former communists including iliescu 
but with 20 percent of the vote counted in timisoara iliescu 
had 77 percent and the fronts share of the parliamentary vote was 
54 percent less than the nationwide average 
the results reflected timisoaras proximity to the west rather 
than the soviet union and its ethnic blend of romanians 
hungarians and serbs 
it was an ethnic hungarian pastor now bishop laszlo toekes 
whose threatened deportation prompted the protests that became 
timisoaras and then the nations revolt against longtime 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
also born in the city was the socalled timisoara declaration a 
document drawn up by activists and later adopted by bucharest 
demonstrators who wanted all former communists out of romanian 
politics 
the civic groups spawned by the revolution campaigned for radu 
campeanu head of the centrist national liberal party he was the 
younger and less aristocratic of the two former exiles who 
challenged iliescu 
campeanu appeared headed for about 17 percent of the vote in 
timisoara reflecting some success in the campaign 
nonetheless timisoaras opposition was bitter they felt 
cheated out of recognition they felt was their due 
serban said iliescu mounted a propaganda campaign to convince 
romanians that only 93 people died in the timisoara uprising 
when we all know that 20 times as many gave their lives for our 
freedom 
final casualty figures for the revolution have never been 
released but observers have said hundreds and perhaps thousands 
died in the fighting 
a sense of shock was tangible in the liberals timisoara 
headquarters monday volunteers shuffled among heaps of campaign 
literature and returning electoral officials brought further news 
of the partys defeat 
some of the opposition alleged fraud in the vote in their 
attempt to explain what was apparently a stunning loss 
we dont know what but something is not right in all this 
said party spokesman marius lapugean he alleged numerous 
irregularities including inadequate voter registration lists and 
a lack of ballot boxes 
more impartial observers attributed iliescus apparent triumph 
even in timisoara in part to what they termed the vehemence of the 
antifront campaign waged by the liberals and peasants 
the opposition in the city went completely overboard with 
their mudslinging campaign against iliescu said srboljub 
miskovic editor of the local magazine 
unsubstantiated insults only provoked the public to rally in 
defense of the party that steered the country to its first 
multiparty elections in decades 
they did themselves a disservice because the national liberal 
partys political platform was essentially acceptable and campeanu 
is personally well liked and respected miskovic said

police arrested 81 aids activists who were 
demonstrating at the national institutes of health on monday for 
more government research on the disease 
about 1000 protestors chanted and shouted as they moved from 
building to building on the nih campus draping red streamers 
through the trees to symbolize the bureaucratic red tape they say 
is slowing research 
on the lawns in front of several buildings they erected 
cardboard headstones symbolizing the many lives lost to aids 
were just trying to get them to change the rules said mark 
harrington of the new yorkbased aids coalition to unleash power 
act up which organized the demonstration 
harrington said the activists want nih to put more emphasis on 
testing drugs that fight the opportunistic infections and cancers 
that kill most aids patients whose immune systems are weakened 
they also want more research into antiviral drugs that work 
differently from azt currently the only approved drug that fights 
the aids virus directly 
the demonstrators say government researchers have focused too 
much on azt and its effectiveness in people with varying stages of 
aids infection the result the activists say is that studies on 
other antiviral drugs have not begun 
in a statement to the media during the demonstration nih 
officials rejected the criticism 
the national institute of allergies and infectious diseases 
which does most of the governments aids research has conducted 
or is preparing to conduct clinical trials of virtually all 
promising antiaids drugs and immuneenhancing agents said dr 
anthony fauci director of the institute 
william raub acting director of nih said that largely due to 
the institutes word effective therapies are now slowing the 
disease prolonging lives and making a significant difference in 
the quality of life of people with aids 
about 60 people were arrested on trespassing charges at the main 
bethesda campus said bob schreiber an nih spokesman 
at the nearby rockville office of the director of aids research 
for the niaid 21 demonstrators were arrested on loitering charges 
montgomery county police said 
police said the demonstrators had the option of paying a 50 
fine or requesting a court date all those arrested were freed 
authorities said 
for years aids activists focused their criticism on the food 
and drug administration saying the agency moved too slowly in 
approving new drugs to fight the disease 
but they are shifting their focus to the researchers at nih 
initially there was a bottleneck at the fda said robert 
garcia of act up but as the epidemic has grown we have had to 
focus on what people are dying from and those are the 
opportunistic infections 
harrington said the fda cant approve drugs that arent 
there 
now were mad because approaches that are promising arent 
being pursued he said

history starting next spring 
the threehour onesemester course will be taken by freshmen 
and sophomores eva wanton dean of general studies said monday 
famu faculty and students have for several years supported such 
a history requirement and it was adopted this year during an 
overall review of the core curriculum wanton said the faculty 
senate gave its approval may 8 
many black educators say humanities have long been taught in a 
vacuum and that a lack of knowledge about black contributions 
breeds a lack of respect 
famu professors concede that one course wont ensure a 
pluralistic education but say its a first step 
the university plans to hire additional faculty to help teach 
the course 
eventually wanton said famu professors hope to write a new 
american history textbook in which black contributions would be 
reported and hispanics and native americans would get their 
due

west european countries must prepare to 
pay more in common defense costs as the united states moves to 
substantially reduce its military presence in europe defense 
ministers said monday 
it is increasingly incumbent upon us as europeans to assume 
a greater responsibility for our defense the ministers said in a 
statement at the end of daylong talks at the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
the united states plans for a diminished role in europe means 
we have to be prepared to take a major responsibility said 
gerhard stoltenberg the west german defense minister 
the united states has increasingly called for the prosperous 
nations of western europe to pay more of the wests defense costs 
members of the us congress have complained that europeans are not 
sharing a fair portion of the defense burden 
west european officials are now talking about footing more of 
the collective security bill because of the possibility of an arms 
control accord between the united states and the soviet union 
stoltenberg told reporters west europeans must realize that the 
united states will gain the major part of reductions in troops 
and arms in a conventional arms agreement with the soviet union 
negotiators for nato and the sovietled warsaw pact are in 
vienna bargaining over reductions in tanks troops artillery and 
other conventional forces in europe western officials want to 
reach an accord in the fall 
an agreement could lead to the united states and the soviet 
union reducing troop size in central europe to 195000 on each 
side the united states would maintain an additional 30000 in 
britain and southern europe 
to meet the new levels moscow would have to pare 370000 
soldiers the united states would have to trim 60000 in central 
europe and 20000 outside the region 
the european officials known as the eurogroup met a day before 
a regularly scheduled meeting of nato defense ministers us 
defense secretary dick cheney will attend the meeting at the 
alliance headquarters in brussels 
in a final statement the eurogroup ministers said nato must 
adapt to the changing security environment prompted by the 
political upheavals in eastern europe 
the ministers said the potential military threat from the warsaw 
pact has been significantly reduced it would decline further they 
said with the reductions in soldiers and weapons expected under a 
conventional arms treaty 
but they cautioned that even after an arms accord the kremlin 
will retain substantial and modern nuclear and conventional 
forces 
they said nato remains vital for the security of western europe 
they also welcomed the prospect of a united germany and said 
membership in nato of the merged nation would further stabilize 
europe 
west germany is a member of nato and east germany belongs to 
the warsaw pact moscow has opposed western demands for the joined 
nation to be part of nato 
a dozen west european countries were represented at mondays 
talks iceland which has no armed forces attended as an observer 
france which does not belong to natos joint military structure 
did not participate

assistant principal surprised him as he prepared to blow up the 
school sunday morning 
several of the 850 students at the rural school had complained 
about givens but not about anything serious said school district 
superintendent wayne qualls 
the complaints were that he couldnt get along with the kids 
but not any real serious problems qualls said 
harlowe said givens was very weird but i would never have 
believed he would do something like this 
anthony pharris a recent graduate also described givens as 
weird hed be teaching a class and hed just get lost 
givens who has taught in hickman county for 16 years may have 
feared he was about to lose his tenured job qualls said 
but while the teacher probably supposed things were stacked 
against him none of the student complaints had been brought 
before the school board qualls said 
the superintendent said givens had personal problems including 
having to care for an invalid brother who was paralyzed in an 
automobile accident 
he also was responsible for taking care of the family farm and 
his elderly parents qualls said

department after firefighters responded to a fire call 
wallace had gone to the school 40 miles southwest of nashville 
sunday morning to prepare a conference room for afternoon 
baccalaureate services

teacher was turning on propane gas taps in the science department 
where candles were burning

separate fires that caused approximately 150000 in damage to the 
school library science department and auditorium police said

senate judiciary chairman joseph biden on 
monday denied president bushs accusations of congressional 
footdragging on major crime legislation saying the administration 
should stop playing politics on the bill 
if the administration wants to make this issue partisan then 
we will biden said as the senate opened debate on a wideranging 
package dealing with capital punishment and related issues 
biden ddel said he was disturbed about recent statements 
made by bush and vice president dan quayle charging that congress 
has given shortshrift to a crime package the president submitted a 
year ago 
we have heard a lot of rhetoric suggesting that the 
presidents crime bill has been languishing in the senate since 
last may and i think its time to set the record straight biden 
said 
the democratic and republican leadership with the concurrence 
of the white house agreed that the crime bill should be discussed 
now biden said 
some elements of the bush package already have been passed 
including the 1988 bill allowing the death penalty for murders 
committed by drug kingpins biden said 
bush in a sunday speech to a law enforcement audience in 
portland ore accused congress of spawning weak imitations of 
his proposals to attack crime after allowing them to languish for a 
year 
we must reject those who softpedal the need to be hard on 
crime bush said 
he accused lawmakers of sitting on key anticrime proposals but 
acknowledged that congress agreed to his request for more federal 
law enforcement officers prosecutors and prisons 
biden said in the senate floor speech that congress not only 
passed key elements of the original bush package but that 
lawmakers strengthened it made it stronger 
on the difficult remaining issues such as capital punishment and 
the length of time prisoners have for filing federal appeals he 
said the administration seems to have no interest in negotiating 
the time to play politics on this kind of issue is over 
biden said 
if they dont want to talk well so be it thats their 
prerogative he said they are not interested in compromise at 
least it seems to me and i hope its not because they see more 
political gain in conflict over cooperation 
many of the senates republicans are supporting a rival crime 
bill introduced by sen strom thurmond of south carolina because of 
its tougher death penalty provisions 
thurmond the ranking republican on the judiciary committee 
told the senate on monday that he was concerned about an amendment 
to the democratic bill introduced by sen edward m kennedy 
dmass which would invalidate use of capital punishment in states 
where it is applied disproportionately to blacks 
thurmond said no evidence had been produced to show that blacks 
or other minorities are discriminated against in the application of 
the death penalty

new evidence casts doubt on the convictions of 
seven people accused of running an irish republican army bomb 
factory in the 1970s the legal counsel for a judicial inquiry said 
monday 
tests that found traces of nitroglycerine on the hands of the 
seven defendants were insufficient to sustain their convictions 
said david clarke in an opening statement to a judicial inquiry 
the inquiry conducted by sir john may has no power to reverse 
the convictions it may be a year before the inquiry makes its 
recommendations to the government 
british courts in the past 12 months have reversed the 
convictions of four people accused of ira bombings and three others 
convicted of plotting to assassinate a british government official 
earlier this year home secretary david waddington ordered a 
review of the convictions of six men for ira bombings in birmingham 
that killed 21 people in 1974 that review has not been completed 
no explosives were found in the possession of the seven 
defendants currently under review but they were convicted of 
possessing explosives 
their convictions were based on tests and on statements made by 
two men convicted of killing seven people in pub bombings in 
guildford and woolwich in 1974 
those men and two others convicted of the pub bombings were 
freed last year after prosecutors admitted that police lied about 
statements made by the defendants 
following their release may a former appeal court judge was 
appointed to conduct an inquiry into the guildford and woolwich 
case and the related conviction in 1976 of four members of the 
maguire family two relatives and a friend 
the test used in the case known as thinlayer chromatography 
or tlc is a reliable test for nitroglycerine clarke said 
in a nutshell the results of the tlc tests viewed now with 
the benefit of hindsight did not of themselves prove that there 
had been in the house a bulk or quantity of explosive which 
had been handled by all the defendants clarke said 
but they do suggest that there had been at least a secondary 
source that is to say a person who had been in contact with a 
primary source that person need not have been one of the 
defendants 
clarke said one of the defendants may have handled a glass or 
towel previously touched by someone who had handled nitroglycerine 
convicted in the case were patrick maguire his wife anne and 
sons vincent and patrick guiseppe conlon husband of patrick 
maguires sister sean john smyth mrs maguires brother and 
family friend patrick joseph oneill 
conlon whose son gerard was convicted in the guildford case 
died in prison the others have completed their sentences 
police began investigating the maguires after statements by paul 
hill and later by gerard conlon identifying anne maguire as a bomb 
maker hill and conlon have said their statements were obtained 
under duress 
clarke said it was impossible to regard any of the maguire 
convictions as safe the standard used by the court of appeal 
in reversing the guildford convictions

plo officials urged monday that un 
troops be sent to the israelioccupied territories to protect 
residents and one official vowed the organization will not be 
silent following the murders of seven palestinians 
abdallah frangi representative for the palestine liberation 
organization in bonn released a statement monday calling for un 
troops in the west bank and gaza strip 
frangi also warned of retaliation for the slaying sunday of 
seven palestinian laborers by an israeli civilian the whole 
world should know we will not be silent we will reply we have 
the power to reply 
farouk kaddoumi foreign affairs chief of the plo said the 
international community has a responsibility to protect 
palestinians in the occupied lands by using un observers 
statements and verbal commitments are no longer sufficient 
the moment has come for concrete acts said kaddoumi he spoke 
while passing through rome airport en route to the arab summit in 
baghdad scheduled for may 28 
frangi appealed to the european economic community to support 
the proposals for un deployment 
he charged that silence by the united states and the eec had 
made israeli officials feel encouraged in their current 
policies 
at least one eec member italy denounced israels handling of 
the palestinian protests that erupted after sundays slayings 
the foreign ministry released a statement monday saying the 
recent unrest confirms that the situation in the occupied 
territories is untenable it urged israel to welcome the 
offer for a peace dialogue growing from the moderate turn in the 
palestinian movement 
frangi said he fears israels continued presence in the west 
bank and gaza strip will spark a war of annihilation in the 
middle east during the next few years 
i am more convinced today that in the near future we will not 
be able to experience peace said frangi 
and i would dare say that in the coming years there will be a 
war of annihilation and those to be held responsible will be 
israeli politicians he said 
frangi said the plo will wait for a decision on how to react to 
the recent violence after the summit of arab states

security forces in kashmir on monday 
opened fire on a crowd of 100000 mourners carrying the body of a 
slain moslem leader killing at least 41 people and wounding 300 
officials said 
earlier monday an official source in new delhi speaking on 
condition of anonymity gave a different account of the shooting 
he said militants opened fire on paramilitary troops and in the 
crossfire approximately 20 people were killed and 40 were 
wounded 
witnesses and doctors in srinagar said 30 bodies and at least 
300 people with bullet wounds were brought to soura hospital 
official sources in srinagar speaking on condition of anonymity 
said 41 were killed in the firing 
witnesses said about 40 bodies were still on the streets of the 
hawal neighborhood of srinagar where the shooting took place the 
city was under curfew and the reports could not be confirmed 
immediately 
prior to mondays killings nearly 400 people had been killed in 
kashmir in clashes between security forces and moslem militants 
the militants want the predominantly moslem state to secede from 
mostly hindu india 
a highranking us government delegation arrived in new delhi 
late sunday to talk with indian leaders about the kashmir crisis 
that has inflamed tensions between india and pakistan 
deputy national security adviser robert gates and john kelly 
the assistant us secretary for near east and south asian affairs 
arrived from pakistan where they met with senior officials 
gates and kelly met indian prime minister vp singh and urged 
india and pakistan to settle the issue with dialogue 
on monday srinagar the capital of kashmir was under curfew 
following the assassination of maulvi mohammad farooq kashmirs 
top islamic religious leader 
but tens of thousands of mourners defied the curfew and streamed 
to soura hospital where they took farooqs body and began marching 
in a procession to his office 6 miles away 
witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said members of 
the paramiltary central reserve police force opened fire without 
warning on the procession at about the 5mile point 
they said farooqs coffin was hit with bullets and the body fell 
out some of the mourners put the body with fresh bullet wounds 
back into the coffin and ran with it into the narrow alleys to his 
office 
foarooqs aides said a funeral date has not been set 
farooq 45 was shot and fatally wounded in his office early 
monday by three unidentified gunmen said his chief aide mohammad 
maqbool 
he said the youths were dressed in western clothes and appeared 
to be kashmiris 
farooq suffered 15 bullet wounds to the head and body and later 
died in soura hospital a doctor said 
before dying farooq blamed his assassination on the hindu 
fundamentalist group shiv sena or shivas army named for the 
hindu god of destruction farooqs private secretary mohammad yaqub 
said 
state government officials blamed the killing on kashmiri 
militants but several militant groups denied responsibility in 
phone calls to local reporters and repeated announcements over 
loudspeakers in mosques that the freedom fighters had no hand 
in the slaying 
farooq had long urged a political settlement of the kashmir 
dispute but saw his importance in the troubled valley eclipsed by 
moslem militants 
he denounced the indian military deployment in the region and 
joined the call for independence after the jan 20 crackdown 
the violence in kashmir has led to a deterioration of relations 
between india and pakistan 
india accuses pakistan of arming and training the moslem 
militants pakistan denies the charge and accuses india of 
violating human rights in a bid to quash what it says is a fight 
for selfdetermination 
the dispute began in 1947 when british colonial india gained 
independence and was divided along religious lines into pakistan 
and india 
kashmirs hindu ruler chose to merge his state with india 
despite its moslem majority pakistan objected to the move and the 
dispute has led to two wars with india

the food and drug administration on monday 
approved use of a live but weakened bacteria to treat a type of 
bladder cancer 
the product bacillus calmette guerin live or bcg live was 
approved to treat bladder cancer referred to as carcinoma in 
situ this type constitutes 20 to 30 percent of the 45000 cases 
of bladder cancer detected in the united states each year the fda 
said 
the treatment calls for the bacteria to be administered directly 
to the bladder through a catheter to attack the cancer cells on the 
lining of the organ the inflammation that results eliminates many 
of the cancer cells 
studies sponsored by the national cancer institute found that 74 
percent of patients with carcinoma in situ of the bladder responded 
to bcg treatment of those the median time for recurrence of the 
cancer was four years the fda said 
the most common side effects of the treatment are flulike 
symptoms such as fever chills and nausea and bladder discomfort 
however the fdaapproved labeling also warns physicians to 
watch for spread of the bcg organism throughout the body this the 
fda said has been associated with two deaths 
treatment with bcg is given once a week for six weeks and then 
monthly for six to 12 months 
the product is made by connaught laboratories ltd of

interim president ion iliescu captured 
87 percent of the 67 million votes counted so far but foreign 
observers clashed monday over whether romanias first multiparty 
election in 53 years was free of fraud the main opposition parties 
charged results of sundays balloting were rigged called romanias 
first attempt at democratic voting a failure and said they would 
contest the elections in court 
ion ratiu the national peasants partys presidential 
candidate said he would take legal action to have the election 
declared null and void 
he vowed to fight against the renewal of communism in 
romania which he said iliescu represents 
iliescu 60 came to power in the december revolution against 
nicolae ceausescu and was the heavy preelection favorite he drew 
huge campaign crowds especially in the countryside where he was 
seen as the man who saved romania from the communist dictator 
the campaign occasionally turned violent but no major incidents 
were reported sunday 
first official results published by the state news agency 
rompres suggested an overwhelming win for iliescu 
most official results were not expected until wednesday because 
of the heavy turnout estimated at more than 85 percent of the 16 
million eligible voters and the complicated ballot which 
contained more than 30 pages 
the dispute among the 500 foreign observers who fanned out 
across the country to watch the voting centered on whether a series 
of irregularities added up to acceptable or unacceptable election 
violations 
gov garrey e carruthers rnm the official us government 
observer called the poll a good election and a very giant 
step toward democracy 
austrian parliamentarian andreas khol general secretary of the 
european democratic union disagreed saying these were a big 
step toward free and democratic elections but they were not free 
and not democratic elections 
carruthers asked the romanian government to set up mechanism to 
investigate allegations of fraud and irregularities during the 
campaign and voting 
prime minister petre roman a prominent member of iliescus 
governing national salvation front said later the central 
electoral bureau had set up a commission to investigate alleged 
improprieties 
already some fraud was discovered he told the associated 
press citing as an example what he said were 25 ballots 
prestamped for the national liberals candidate radu campeanu 
rompres said that with 67 million votes counted iliescu had 87 
percent campeanu 10 percent and ratiu 3 percent 
its vote report also had the front winning nearly twothirds of 
the seats in parliament so far 
a onetime communist official who opposed ceausescu in 1971 
iliescu gained sympathy for being demoted and was far better known 
and popular than either campeanu or ratiu who spent decades in 
exile 
iliescu won wide support from peasants by permitting them to own 
large plots of land industrial workers about 40 percent of 
romanias labor force liked his pledges to move slowly in 
transforming romanias statecontrolled economy to a capitalist 
free market 
his apparent triumph and the strong showing for the front 
suggested that anticommunist demonstrators who blocked a main 
square in bucharest for a 30th day monday and protesters in other 
cities enjoyed little broad popular support 
iliescu and the front look like becoming the first excommunists 
in eastern europe to triumph in the regions current series of 
multiparty elections 
initial rompres results for the twochamber parliament gave the 
front about 65 percent liberals 7 percent peasants 3 percent 
and ecologists 3 percent 
the hungarian democratic union representing romanias 2 million 
hungarian minority had about 7 to 8 percent the other votes went 
to tiny parties 
ratiu who attended carruthers news conference said the 
governors upbeat assessment would completely mislead americans and 
president bush 
calling the election a fraud ratiu said there was no 
semblance of democracy about it 
we will contest the election if this is the sort of result 
that we get he said pledging to demand new elections 
the various observer groups reported instances of ballots 
prestamped for iliescu front members accompanying elderly voters 
into the booth nonregistered voters casting ballots and 
individuals voting several times 
many observer complaints focused on the campaign rather than the 
voting itself several alleged that the front which dominated the 
interim government unfairly controlled the election apparatus and 
the electronic media 
carruthers and other observers urged the west and the new 
romanian government to work to create a free press as a guarantee 
of future democracy 
the process was flawed but the very fact that an election has 
taken place is itself a remarkable achievement said a 60member 
delegation sponsored by the us republican and democratic parties 
one could not say there was organized fraud said andre 
billardon vice president of the french national assembly and a 
member of its observer group 
the united states has said future usromanian relations and 
us trade concessions important to romanias shattered economy 
are conditional on whether the elections were fully free and 
fair

the house began debate monday over the first 
strengthening of clean air laws in 13 years while closeddoor 
negotiations appeared unlikely to head off a floor fight over a 
tougher smogcontrol proposal 
the house was expected to vote on a series of about a halfdozen 
amendments to the bill later in the week with a final vote on the 
legislation expected by thursday 
the senate already has approved a clean air bill 
the legislation before the house won overwhelming approval from 
the energy and commerce committee in april its major provisions 
including major cuts in acid rain pollutants reduction in smog 
causing auto emissions and controls on toxic industrial releases 
are unlikely to be changed dramatically during floor action 
the legislations cost to the economy because of new 
pollutioncontrol requirements has been put at about 21 billion a 
year when all its provisions go into effect 
as floor debate began on the bill key congressmen and staff 
aides worked to reach compromise agreements on about a halfdozen 
amendments with an aim toward avoiding as many contentuous floor 
battles as possible 
but parties to the discussions said a floor fight has become 
almost unavoidable on a proposed amendment by rep henry waxman 
dcalif that calls for the annual production of 1 million 
nongasoline powered automobiles for sale in the nine us cities 
with the highest air pollution 
the cities are los angeles san diego houston chicago 
milwaukee baltimore new york philadelphia and hartford conn 
the measure would make the bills smogcontrolling auto emission 
requiring significantly tougher than the senate version which has 
no production requirement 
the auto industry has launched an allout campaign to block the 
proposal arguing that it would require manufacturers to rush such 
cars into production without clear evidence there would be a market 
for them 
waxman speaking on the house floor characterized his proposal 
as nothing more than what president bush had sought nearly a year 
ago when he included as part of his clean air proposal a 
requirement for alternativefuel vehicles 
but the white house backed away from imposing a production 
requirement after intense lobbying from the auto industry 
the senate defeated efforts to impose a similar requirement as 
did waxmans own energy and commerce subcommittee both 
environmentalists and auto industry lobbyists predicted a close 
vote on the amendment when it comes to the house floor 
in opening remarks in the floor debate rep john dingell 
dmich the energy and commerce committee chairman who has long 
been protective of the auto industrys interests suggested that 
most controversies on the clean air legislation have been largely 
eliminated 
dingell characterized the remaining issues of disagreement as 
being not environmental in character but rather differences of 
views among congressmen 
meanwhile compromise agreements were reported monday to have 
been worked out on several amendments assuring their swift 
approval when brought to the floor these included 
a requirement to sell in the nine cities with the worst smog 
problem a cleaner gasoline blend that has a specific oxygen 
content allowing it to burn cleaner the oil industry vigorously 
opposed the measure calling it tilted toward the use of ethenol 
which comes from grain 
require the environmental protection agency within two years to 
develop regulations on regional haze near major federal parks and 
wilderness areas environmentalists have claimed the epa has been 
slow in curbing air pollution in such areas 
streamline some provisions of the permitting and enforcement 
section of the bill to ease the paperwork burden to some businesses 
other amendments likely to be taken up on the house floor 
include a provision broading the required phaseout of a variety of 
atmospheric ozonedamaging chemicals in addition to 
chloroflurocarbons or cfcs and an amendment that would impose 
federal air pollution requirements on offshore oildrilling 
platforms

american her husband is danny liska of niobrara neb a 
motorcycle enthusiast who cruised into town and married her in 1968 
with reginas broom her official symbol and liskas 
motorcycle the pair have ridden to fame 
they operate out of a huge threestory building where there are 
some rather strange goingson in one huge room recently a dozen 
people holding hands in a circle swayed and moaned while an elderly 
man sat in a chair 
no one would say what it was all about 
there is a book store a shop offering metaphysical 
paraphernalia and a shop where disciples yellow graduation type 
gowns are made on sewing machines 
each night scores of people sometimes as many as 300 gather 
around a large wooden platform to hear regina 11 she makes 
predictions and talks about spirits curing people abstaining from 
liquor and cigarettes and voting for her next sunday 
this is the second time she has run for president the first 
time in 1986 she received 74000 votes she had 860000 but was 
cheated of victory by fraud she said in an interview at her 
headquarters 
predictions for the coming year 
an earthquake will destroy vast parts of northern mexico and 
southern california

the operator of a kentucky mine where 10 
workers died in an explosion last year was cited monday for 121 
alleged violations of federal safety laws 
the labor departments mine safety and health administration 
said 42 violations against pyro mining co involved reckless 
disregard of safety the highest degree of negligence in the 
agencys penalty system 
the number and nature of the violations show a lack of concern 
about safety on the part of the operator as well as poor safety 
management said william tattersall assistant secretary of labor 
for mine safety and health 
james greenlee executive vice president of costain coal inc 
which owns pyro said the company was reviewing the alleged 
violations to determine whether it will request a conference with 
federal investigators to give them more information about safety 
procedures 
companies are allowed to provide additional information before 
the agency proposes fines for alleged safety violations 
eventually pyro mining could face civil penalties of up to 10000 
for each violation 
an agency report earlier this month said 10 specific violations 
contributed to the sept 13 explosion in wheatcroft ky most of 
the violations identified monday had nothing to do with the cause 
of the blast but we still consider them serious tattersall 
said 
the agency report released may 8 said an investigation showed 
that pyro mining managers knew explosive methane gas was 
accumulating in the mine four days before the explosion but they 
did not maintain adequate records that would have alerted the 
others 
that report alleged that managers failed to make required checks 
for the deadly gas in the hours before the explosion failed to 
keep enough clean air in the mine to clear out methane and made a 
series of changes in air pathways that caused a methane buildup the 
day of the disaster 
federal investigators were unable to determine exactly what 
triggered the explosion 
mondays announcement said investigators looking for possible 
ignition sources found 65 electrical violations in cables and 
circuits one electrical cable had 36 splices all of which had 
been improperly made tattersall said 
investigators also found 41 violations concerning ventilation 
and preshift safety examinations another 15 citations involved 
miscellaneous safety violatings including blasting caps 
haphazardly left in the work area

president bush said monday the federal 
government ought to strike a needed balance between 
environmental priorities and economic concerns 
addressing a controversial proposal to protect the northern 
spotted owl the president told a republican fundraising breakfast 
that he rejects environmentalists who ignore the economic 
consequences of protecting such fragile species 
the us fish and wildlife service is to decide june 23 whether 
to add the owl to the endangered species list such a decision 
would require federal agencies to protect the owls habitat the 
northwests oldgrowth forests 
earlier this month the us forest service and the bureau of 
land management said such a decision would cut timber harvests from 
federal lands nearly in half over the next five years producing a 
net loss of about 13000 jobs in oregon washington and northern 
california 
bush said that he is concerned about preserving and protecting 
our environment but that he rejects those who would ignore the 
economic consequences of the spotted owl decision the jobs of many 
thousands of oregonians and whole communities are at stake 
he told the breakfast held to raise money for gop gubernatorial 
candidate dave frohnmayer common sense tells us to find a needed 
balance 
its going to take a lot of work to protect this great planet 
and its wildlife without throwing hardworking citizens out of a 
job the president said telling his audience he disagrees with 
those who do not recognize their obligation to protect our 
delicate ecosystem 
referring to other contentious environmental issues bush said 
i want congress to pass a bill that will sharply cut acid rain 
smog and toxic pollutants but congress has got to respect another 
kind of delicate ecology that of jobs and opportunity 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater asked after bushs 
speech if the administration was considering proposing changes in 
the endangered species act said there has been no consideration 
of it 
earlier this month however interior secretary manuel lujan 
said the law was just too tough and added weve got to 
change it 
rep denny smith rore said bush has agreed to schedule a 
white house meeting with a group of oregon residents to discuss a 
longterm solution to the northwests timbersupply problem 
this meeting will give oregonians living in rural communities 
the chance to tell their side of the story smith said their 
jobs and way of life are on the line and yet all weve been 
hearing about is how we need to protect the spotted owl 
national wildlife federation president jay d hair said 
meanwhile that if president bush is truly committed to 
protecting both oregon jobs and the environment he should 
recognize that the problems of an ailing timber industry predate 
concerns over owls or ancient forests resorting to scapegoating 
the owl for political gain does nothing to achieve balance 
bush also said he wants congress to move on his proposals to 
block drug smugglers fund more border agents and give them more 
enforcement authority as well as the power to order suspected 
drugsmuggling planes to land 
to those who ask if our measures are too harsh i say that the 
threat to many americans especially those living in the 
innercity is too great he said 
about 150 to 200 people demonstrated outside the hotel where 
bush spoke burning american flags and newspapers and setting off 
smoke bombs police arrested 27 
the demonstrators appeared to be mostly of college age and 
represent many groups including peace activists prochoice 
demonstrators environmentalists and gay rights advocates 
frohnmayer is seeking to replace democratic gov neil 
goldschmidt who is retiring 
from portland bush travelled to los angeles and sat in on a 
meeting of antidrug activists in a private home in the oakwood 
district of venice 
he praised the community for banding together to drive out drug 
dealers who had once overrun the neighborhood 
working with police they decided to reclaim their streets to 
reclaim their children to reclaim their future and they are 
succeeding bush told a gathering outside the house 
the president delivered a plaque to community leaders naming the 
oakwood community beautification committee as a daily point of 
light bush issues the award every day to individuals or 
organizations that exemplify his thousand points of light theme 
of volunteerism

four members of the massachusetts 
congressional delegation urged procter amp gamble on monday to resume 
advertising on two tv stations that aired spots critical of pampgs 
purchase of coffee from el salvador 
a letter signed by sen edward m kennedy and reps edward 
markey joseph p kennedy ii and joseph moakley all democrats 
said pampgs decision to pull ads from a station in boston and 
another in worcester mass set a dangerous precedent 
the company the nations largest advertiser of packaged 
products pulled ads in response to a 30second commercial that 
called for a boycott of folgers coffee 
the commercials were produced by neighbor to neighbor a 
political advocacy group that favors a boycott of folgers as a way 
of influencing us foreign policy toward el salvador a portion of 
the coffee that goes into folgers comes from el salvador 
we are alarmed that your companys decision to suspend 
advertising on the two stations simply for disagreeing with the 
content of another paid advertisement broadcast over those 
stations is an extremely harmful precedent the legislators 
wrote 
our concern is that television stations might fall victim to 
intimidation from a large advertiser out of fear of economic 
retribution for airing paid commercials from smaller advertisers 
the letter said such economic intimidation comes very close to 
an effective corporate censorship over advertising content 
the letter was addressed to edwin l artzt chief exectutive 
officer of cincinnatibased procter amp gamble 
a spokeswoman for procter amp gamble did not immediately return a 
phone call seeking comment

north yemens prowestern parliament on 
monday approved a plan by president ali abdullah saleh to merge 
tuesday with socialist south yemen official radio reports in north 
yemen said 
the reports said the 159member shura council or parliament 
had agreed with a sweeping majority to merge the two yemens 
which are among the worlds least developed states sana the 
north yemeni capital is to serve as capital of the newly named 
yemen republic 
south yemens parliament the supreme peoples council also 
held a special session to approve the unification of the two red 
sea nations 
a united yemen would be the second such union between two arab 
states in this century in the 1950s egypt and syria joined as the 
united arab republic but the merger collapsed after three years 
because of internal squabbling 
the new state would bind together 11 million people nine 
million from the north and two million from the south 
south yemen was the arab worlds only avowedly marxist state 
after it gained independence from britain in 1971 
but yemen began to reform as democratic changes swept through 
the soviet union and eastern europe 
the two yemens are poor and undeveloped labor unrest in south 
yemen has been aggravated in recent months as western goods were 
transported from north yemen to the south 
strikes mushroomed in most government offices and factories in 
south yemen 
the merger bid has been outwardly promoted by oilrich nations 
on the arabian peninsula such as saudi arabia which is eager to 
snuff out soviet influence 
scores of cuban and east german military experts are said to 
have left aden the capital of south yemen in recent months a 
friendship pact entitles the soviets to maintain as many as 18000 
troops in the port city but the extent of their deployment is 
unknown 
the merger was originally planned for nov 30 but it was moved 
up to may 26 in recent days there had been pressure to speed up 
the schedule even more so the two yemens can attend an emergency 
arab summit on may 28 in baghdad iraq as one state 
shortly after the start of the session of south yemens 
111member supreme peoples council television announced that 
foreign minister abdulaziz aldali had suggested tuesday as the 
merger date 
north yemens president then said he too expected a merger at 
noon tuesday when the new flag of the yemen republic would be 
raised 
the flag is similar to the black white and red one of north 
yemen but without the stars 
north yemens lawmakers were to travel to aden for a joint 
parliamentary session to proclaim the merger 
a draft agreement on unification was agreed to by leaders of 
both nations on april 22 in the city of taiz halfway between aden 
and north yemens capital of sana 
a planned transition period of 2 years coincides with the 
remainder of the fiveyear terms for both legislatures 
north yemens president is expected to be elected as head of a 
fivemember presidential council

panels of medical experts on monday 
recommended stronger efforts to ensure that the acne drug accutane 
is not taken during pregnancy because it can cause birth defects 
but the two food and drug administration advisory committees 
rejected the advice of some within the agency who want accutane 
withheld from all women to eliminate any risk of birth defects from 
the drug 
the manufacturer hoffmanlaroche said it was pleased with the 
recommendations which it said were close to additional warnings it 
announced earlier in the day 
accutane which has been on the market since 1982 is the best 
treatment for severe recalcitrant cystic acne a disfiguring and 
debilitating form of acne but a woman who takes the drug during 
pregnancy has a 1in4 chance of having a baby with serious birth 
defects 
the committee actions came as other physicians were reporting 
that accutane can significantly block the growth of new tumors in 
people being treated for smokingrelated cancer of the mouth and 
throat 
in september 1988 roche dermatologics a division of 
hoffmanlaroche began a pregnancy prevention program aimed at 
emphasizing and educating physicians about the importance of 
avoiding pregancy during treatment 
roche officials say 86 cases of birth defects have been reported 
to the company as being associated with accutane since the drug was 
first marketed 
but david graham an fda medical epidemiologist said that 
number represents only about 10 percent of the number that actually 
occur he estimated that since 1982 nearly 1000 babies have been 
born with birth defects because their mothers were using accutane 
graham also estimated that about 90 percent of the women using 
accutane do not have the severe form of acne for which the drug is 
indicated 
accutane was prescribed last year for about 65000 women of 
childbearing age but the estimated annual incidence of severe 
recalcitrant cystic acne in this group of women is less than 4000 
graham said 
the overprescribing exposes tens of thousands of women to the 
possibility of a malformed child if they become pregnant while 
being treated he said it also increases the likelihood of 
abortion he said 
citing a michigan medicaid study he said women using accutane 
had twice as many abortions as women not using the drug 
he said roches pregnancy prevention program has failed to 
achieve its objective 
the only way to eliminate exposure is to eliminate use of this 
drug by women he said 
robert armstrong director of medical affairs for roche 
dermatologics said grahams estimates were based on shaky 
assumptions 
he also said that no one is sure how many women have the severe 
acne but he said he was sure the number of congenital 
malformations that result from accutane are not as large as graham 
believes 
if there were that many out there they would be noticed and 
reported armstrong said 
the fdas advisory committees on dermatologic drugs and 
fertility and maternal health drugs recommended by general 
consensus that the company emphasize in its program the importance 
of a pregnancy test before a patient starts using accutane 
the panels also recommended a program for patients to return any 
unused accutane at the end of treatment and that forms to record 
patient consent now available in english and spanish be available 
in more languages additionally the panels said physicians should 
be encouraged to refer accutane patients for contraception 
counseling 
roche announced earlier in the day it was supplementing its 
pregnancy prevention program to stress the importance of the first 
pregnancy test which roche will offer to pay for and which must 
show no pregnancy before therapy can begin 
other new measures include steppedup advertising aimed at 
physicians possible development of a special prescription pad to 
reinforce the warnings provision of an illustration of a deformed 
infant in the package literature and development of a method to 
return unused accutane

a palestinian with a dagger and pistol 
boarded a bus carrying french tourists monday and shot or stabbed 
10 people wounding at least one critically police said they said 
he acted to avenge a massacre in israel 
on monday night police fought thousands of demonstrators 
marching toward the us embassy to vent their fury over sundays 
killings of seven palestinian laborers in israel and subsequent 
violence on the west bank and gaza strip 
several police were injured at least two demonstrators arrested 
and dozens of shop windows shattered but no serious casualties 
were reported 
the slayings set off protests in jordans palestinian refugee 
camps 
jordanian authorities said nine tourists and a jordanian tour 
photographer were wounded monday in the bus rampage by ahmad 
badwan 28 a palestinian from the israelioccupied gaza strip who 
carried a temporary jordanian passport and lived in amman 
the motive behind the amman shooting incident was to avenge 
the killing of palestinian laborers in a tel aviv suburb sunday 
a police spokesman said but refused to elaborate 
israeli police said the israeli who shot seven palestinians to 
death and wounded others was deranged the shootings led to violent 
demonstrations in israels occupied territories in which more 
deaths and injuries occurred 
on monday morning the palestinian gunman got on the bus with 30 
tourists aboard while it was parked near a popular tourist attract 
the roman amphitheater in downtown amman he threatened to shoot 
if anybody moved said a police official who cannot be named 
under standing regulations 
the tourists were scared and many started shouting which 
pushed the gunman to fire in all directions from a 7mm pistol he 
said 
an interior ministry announcement said the man fired until he 
ran out of ammunition then stabbed two tourists with a dagger 
before surrendering to police 
police arrested the attacker amid pandemonium pedestrians and 
shopkeepers fled in panic when the gunshots rang out 
five tourists were treated at bashir hospital and released five 
other victims were transferred to hussein medical center for 
further treatment 
the hospital said 55yearold andre pierro of paris was in 
critical condition with gunshot wounds in his left arm and right 
thigh and a stab wound in the stomach 
french ambassador denis bauchard said christian legendre 62 of 
paris was shot in the left side of the chest and also was in 
critical condition 
jordanian marwan albaba 30 was shot in both palms he was a 
photographer for the jordanian agency that handled the tourist 
group 
french president francois mitterrand called the hospital to 
inquire about the victims jordanian officials said 
king hussein and crown prince hassan visited the wounded 
jordanian police said they were tightening security for foreign 
tourists they said police cars would escort the estimated three 
dozen tour buses visiting jordanian sites 
hussein said in a tv address he was surprised that the attack 
took place in our hospitable nation it is probably related 
to a feeling of anger toward israel and its crimes especially 
for what happened yesterday 
but he said the violence in israel was not an enough excuse at 
all for what happened in amman today 
the demonstration was brewing in the streets as the king spoke 
the protesters appeared a mix of moslem fundamentalists and 
palestinian nationalists 
some waved the the koran islams holy book and shouted 
allahu akhbar god is great others waved black or 
palestinian flags and yelled the us is the head of the snake 
referring to israel 
they hurled rocks at police on the roads leading toward the 
embassy wounding several 
police used tear gas and billy clubs trying in vain to divert 
the demonstrators from the mixed residential and business area 
around the embassy 
the police and army deployed a huge force to seal off the street 
outside the us embassy where 30 riot police linked arms at each 
of 10 roadblocks 
frustrated demonstrators broke shop windows and traffic lights 
and rolled garbage cans into the street 
at least 20000 palestinian residents of the baqaa refugee camp 
17 miles northwest of amman demonstrated on monday to protest the 
killings in israel 
they rolled burning tires onto the ammantodamascus highway 
closing it for more than four hours police fired tear gas inside 
the camp when the demonstrators started to march toward amman 
roughly half of jordans 31 million people come from 
palestinian families who fled or were forced from their homeland 
during the 1948 and the 1967 arabisraeli wars

president patricio aylwin said monday 
in his first state of the nation address that he will seek truth 
and justice in investigating human rights abuses under the past 
military regime 
we know that many cruel and painful things have occurred 
leaving as a result not only suffering but also anger among many of 
our compatriots he said 
ignoring those events would mean worsening that suffering and 
allowing that anger to turn into irrational expressions of hatred 
and violence the 71yearold president added 
aylwin spoke before a joint session of the twochamber congress 
in this port city 75 miles northwest of santiago the nations top 
military and civilian leaders attended the address 
but aylwins predecessor gen augusto pinochet was absent from 
the assembly pinochet ruled for 16 years until march 11 and was 
condemned by international organizations for widespread rights 
abuses 
aylwins twohour speech restored a tradition in chile in which 
the president delivers his annual state of the nation address 
before congress 
during pincohets rule congress was suspended and the annual 
address was delivered before military commanders government 
officials and supporters 
the 74yearold general remains commander of the 60000man army 
he has made clear his deep opposition to aylwins efforts to 
investigate rights violations 
pinochet personally conveyed to aylwin his concern over the 
presidents establishment in april of the commission for truth and 
reconciliation which is gathering information on rights cases 
the commissions work is expected to result in a number of 
rights trials many involving military officers 
aylwin insisted monday that the commission not bring the armed 
forces to trial 
the panel he said will not only investigate abuses committed 
by security officials of the pinochet regime but also terrorist 
attacks in which soldiers were the victims 
after taking power in a 1973 coup pinochet launched a harsh 
crackdown on the supporters of the ousted leftist government 
thousands were arrested and many were tortured or killed tens of 
thousands were forced into exile 
aylwin said in his speech that he wants a reconciliation among 
civilians and military but he admitted this would be difficult 
for decades the members of the armed forces had good reason 
to feel segregated aylwin said and for the last 16 years a 
large portion of our population had good reasons to feel mistreated 
and humiliated 
aylwin said his government will also try to preserve and 
strengthen the newly restored democracy maintain economic 
development promote social justice and respect human rights

veteran congressman larry craig shook hands 
with workers at shift changes monday confident of victory in the 
gop primary race to replace us sen james mcclure 
i think it will be a good win a strong win said craig who 
is favored to beat attorney general jim jones in the primary 
tuesday 
mcclure a republican who served three terms will retire at the 
end of his current term 
jones who raised just onetenth of the 400000 craig gathered 
to bankroll his campaign also was in boise monday but focused on 
his official duties after his populist shoestring campaign ran its 
course 
beside voting his only electionday plans were to take his 
12yearold daughter to lunch 
at this point the die is pretty much cast and well see how 
things come out said jones who hoped for a relatively light 
turnout that would indicate a failure of craigs campaign to 
energize voters 
state election officials expected 30 percent to 35 percent of 
registered voters to vote after a generally lackluster campaign for 
one of only three us senate races this year without an incumbent 
involved 
boise businessman ron twilegar the former state senate 
democratic leader met with strategists on the eve of his 
anticipated primary victory over political newcomer david steed an 
idaho falls businessman 
twilegar admitted he faced an uphill battle in the fall for a 
seat that has traditionally gone to the gop 
all three republicans fighting for the right to block democrat 
gov cecil andrus heavily favored bid for an unprecedented fourth 
term this fall put in a final day of campaigning polls indicated 
gop voters remained largely undecided 
state sen rachel gilbert of boise the chairman of the 
taxwriting committee pressed her claim to the frontrunners 
spot and former state senate majority leader roger fairchild of 
fruitland admitted a low turnout would hand ms gilbert the 
nomination 
boise stockbroker milton erhart pinned his hopes on being the 
only candidate in the field with a prochoice abortion stand and 
he also needed a relatively high turnout to draw voters beyond the 
traditional conservatives who generally dominate idaho gop 
primaries

interim president ion iliescu captured 
87 percent of the 67 million votes counted so far but foreign 
observers disagreed monday whether romanias first multiparty 
election in 53 years was free of fraud 
the main opposition parties charged results of sundays 
balloting were rigged called romanias first attempt at democratic 
voting a failure and said they would contest the elections in 
court 
ion ratiu the national peasants partys presidential 
candidate said he would take legal action to have the election 
declared null and void 
he vowed to fight against the renewal of communism in 
romania which he said iliescu represents 
iliescu 60 came to power in the december revolution against 
nicolae ceausescu and was the heavy preelection favorite he drew 
huge campaign crowds especially in the countryside where he was 
seen as the man who saved romania from the communist dictator 
the campaign occasionally turned violent but no major incidents 
were reported sunday 
first official results published by the state news agency 
rompres suggested an overwhelming win for iliescu 
most official results were not expected until wednesday because 
of the heavy turnout estimated at more than 85 percent of the 16 
million eligible voters and the complicated ballot which 
contained more than 30 pages 
the dispute among the 500 foreign observers who fanned out 
across the country to watch the voting centered on whether a series 
of irregularities added up to acceptable or unacceptable election 
violations 
gov garrey e carruthers rnm the official us government 
observer called the poll a good election and a very giant 
step toward democracy 
austrian parliamentarian andreas khol general secretary of the 
european democratic union disagreed saying these were a big 
step toward free and democratic elections but they were not free 
and not democratic elections 
carruthers asked the romanian government to set up mechanism to 
investigate allegations of fraud and irregularities during the 
campaign and voting 
prime minister petre roman a prominent member of iliescus 
governing national salvation front said later the central 
electoral bureau had set up a commission to investigate alleged 
improprieties 
already some fraud was discovered he told the associated 
press citing as an example what he said were 25 ballots 
prestamped for the national liberals candidate radu campeanu 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said voter fraud was minimal and hailed the elections as an 
important beginning for romania 
we note that problems with voting and other election day 
irregularities appear to have been minimal although opposition 
political party leaders have complained of breaches of election law 
procedures boucher said 
but he said the election campaign was flawed by candidates lack 
of access to the news media and the intimidation of opposition 
candidates 
he said there were no conclusions about possible us economic 
aid to romania because our assessment of the elections is only 
now beginning 
the united states has said future relations and us trade 
concessions important to romanias shattered economy are 
conditional on whether the elections were fully free and fair 
rompres said that with 67 million votes counted iliescu had 87 
percent campeanu 10 percent and ratiu 3 percent 
its vote report also had the front winning nearly twothirds of 
the seats in parliament 
a onetime communist official who opposed ceausescu in 1971 
iliescu gained sympathy for being demoted and was far better known 
and popular than either campeanu or ratiu who spent decades in 
exile 
iliescu won wide support from peasants by permitting them to own 
large plots of land industrial workers about 40 percent of 
romanias labor force liked his pledges to move slowly in 
transforming romanias statecontrolled economy to a capitalist 
free market 
iliescu and the front will likely be the first excommunists in 
eastern europe to triumph in the regions current series of 
multiparty elections 
initial rompres results for the twochamber parliament gave the 
front about 65 percent liberals 7 percent peasants 3 percent 
and ecologists 3 percent 
the hungarian democratic union representing romanias 2 million 
hungarian minority had about 7 to 8 percent the other votes went 
to tiny parties 
ratiu who attended carruthers news conference said the 
governors upbeat assessment would completely mislead americans and 
president bush 
calling the election a fraud ratiu said there was no 
semblance of democracy about it 
we will contest the election if this is the sort of result 
that we get he said pledging to demand new elections 
the various observer groups reported instances of ballots 
prestamped for iliescu front members accompanying elderly voters 
into the booth nonregistered voters casting ballots and 
individuals voting several times 
many observer complaints focused on the campaign rather than the 
voting itself several alleged that the front which dominated the 
interim government unfairly controlled the election apparatus and 
the electronic media 
carruthers and other observers urged the west and the new 
romanian government to work to create a free press as a guarantee 
of future democracy

the flash flood that turned this resort 
towns main drag into a river receded as fast as it arrived but a 
new problem emerged from the muck monday the weekend flood caused 
a drought of the thermal spring water that gave the town its name 
and its tourist industry 
the 13 inches of rain that fell in 24 hours knocked out the 
pumps at the end of bathhouse row that supply 140degree 
underground water to the spas 
it will take at least a week to fix them said roger giddings 
superintendent of hot springs national park which runs the pumps 
its the lifeblood of hot springs giddings said of the 
water that has has attracted the infirm the healthconscious and 
the athletic to this city of 36000 for nearly a century 
elsewhere waterlogged communities in louisiana and texas were 
emerging from under floodwaters that have raged through several 
states for days 
downtown hot springs which lies in a steep valley was flooded 
when rain overwhelmed drainage systems nobody was injured and a 
preliminary partial estimate by the city managers office put 
damage at 53 million to businesses and public works that doesnt 
include damage to more than 100 private homes 
business leaders were more concerned about a loss of business 
than the temporary loss of water which is pumped from the areas 
23 springs to seven bathhouses and three hotels 
at least 90 percent of the downtown business is linked to 
tourism and the city isnt ready to concede that kind of money to 
a flood especially with memorial day looming 
on monday store owners replaced shattered windows and swept 
away the mud an advertising blitz was planned to let potential 
tourists know the town is waiting with open arms 
our town and state have been shown to a national television 
audience as being swept by torrents of raging rainfall said bob 
wheeler a member of the city board of directors true here in 
hot springs we had a bad saturday night but that is over and we 
will be ready for summer vacationers by this weekend 
elsewhere on central avenue don wilson of the salvation army 
handed out ham and cheese sandwiches from a beatup food truck don 
heath owner of craft and fair watched as several workers hauled 
his carpet out to the street and hosed off the sediment 
i dont want to win any awards but we were the hardest hit 
said imy marcus owner of the toy chest downtown he said about 
30000 worth of stuffed animals and dolls about 40 percent of 
his inventory were swept away by the two flash floods that hit 
saturday and sunday 
his store will be open by next week marcus said 
far worse was the plight of the owners of about 136 homes 
destroyed by the flood flooding along lake catherine about 20 
miles from downtown appeared to be the worst 
phil phillips whose house sits about 20 feet from the lake 
picked through his soggy furnishings this fiddle was made in 
1814 he told a reporter cant tell you how much its worth 
his wife edith said the water rose to the rooftop but dropped 
to puddlelevel within a few hours sunday morning 
it came so quick and did so much she said 
in louisiana the red river that runs through the red river 
parish northeast of alexandria began inching back toward its banks 
flood covered at least 140 square miles of farmland and drove 
more than 300 people from their homes in the past week most were 
able to return by monday officials said 
were in better shape now than weve been in a long time 
said chief warren perkins of the red river sheriffs office 
were just worried about more rain i suspect a lot of people 
will leave the sand bags in place for a while 
in southeast texas the trinity rivers rise in liberty county 
appeared to slow monday 
the trinity hit a record of 2951 feet in liberty on monday and 
the national weather service said it was expected to crest at 296 
feet thursday 56 feet above flood stage it could be weeks before 
the trinity is back in its banks officials said 
an estimated 4600 homes have been affected by flooding in a 
sevencounty area although red cross spokesman bill barron said he 
didnt know whether that many homes actually had been flooded

police went on strike monday firing 
shots into the air and shooting out the tires of cars and buses 
further threatening this embattled governments grip on power 
state radio said ivory coast president felix houphouetboigny 
met with a delegation of police and promised to review their 
demands and by late afternoon police appeared to have returned to 
their regular duties 
the radio gave no further information houphouetboigny has met 
with various striking groups in recent weeks including the 
military and each time promised to improve their conditions 
although france recently stepped up aid to this former colony 
it was not clear how houphouetboigny would be able to fulfill his 
promises the government has been unable to pay its foreign debt 
and has had difficulty meeting government payrolls 
the police strike came as no surprise after last weeks army 
mutiny soldiers took over the national broadcast center twice and 
on may 16 seized the abidjan airport for nine hours they left 
after being promised their demands for better pay and working 
conditions would be met 
many of the mutinous soldiers were conscripts who said despite 
difficult conditions they wanted to remain in the military because 
they believed they had no hope of finding other jobs 
france a strong supporter of houphouetboigny refused his 
request to intervene and dislodge the soldiers from the airport 
but it did send a top paramilitary police official to abidjan to 
advise the president 
two days after the airport seizure the government announced it 
had met the soldiers demands several other groups including bus 
drivers have launched strikes and have also won their demands 
the economic difficulties are the result of a sharp fall in 
prices for the countrys main exports cocoa and coffee 
the wave of protests began after the president under pressure 
from foreign creditors tried to impose austerity measures in march 
the protests forced the closing of schools for the rest of the 
year and the withdrawal of the austerity measures 
houphouetboigny africas longest serving president also was 
forced to ease severe restrictions against opposition parties 
houphouets democratic party has ruled the country as a de facto 
oneparty state since independence from france in 1960

more than 300000 medical laboratories 
including those in physicians offices would have to meet federal 
standards under regulations proposed monday 
the regulations written by the department of health and human 
services are aimed at assuring the quality and accuracy of medical 
tests said hhs secretary louis sullivan 
under our plan every laboratory regardless of its location 
must be federally certified as meeting quality standards he 
said labs must prove they can perform their tests correctly 
under the proposal laboratory tests would be divided into three 
categories 
tests that are complex and pose a high risk if done incorrectly 
such as pap smears to test for cervical cancer and simpler tests 
with some risk like cholesterol screening would be subject to 
federal standards 
twentyeight tests that hhs describes as simple with lowrisk 
such as dipstick urinalysis would be waived from regulation 
labs that fail to comply with federal requirements for quality 
control personnel qualifications and proficiency testing could 
have their certification revoked suspended or limited or suffer 
other civil penalties 
the regulation would implement a law passed by congress in 1988 
after reports about inaccuracies in pap smear tests

greece has granted full diplomatic 
recognition to israel for the first time since the jewish state was 
founded in 1948 premier constantine mitsotakis said monday 
he told a cabinet meeting greece has also upgraded ties with the 
palestine liberation organization 
greece is the last member of the 12nation european community to 
grant israel full recognition 
but mitsotakis said that de jure recognition does not 
recognize the annexation nor the occupation by israel of arab 
territories seized in 1967 
greece has often expressed its opposition to israels continued 
occupation of the west bank and its policy toward the palestinians 
mitsotakis made a campaign pledge to recognize israel prior to 
the april 8 general election 
he said greek ties with the plo would resemble those now 
existing between france and the plo france recognizes the missions 
of quebec and the plo in paris as general delegations and their 
representatives as delegate general it traditionally recognizes 
countries and not governments or movements 
the plos status as a general delegation is the only of its kind 
in france it is less than a full state and does not imply 
diplomatic recognition 
the plo maintains a diplomatic mission in athens and its ranking 
member is accorded the title of head of mission 
israels diplomatic representative will now have full 
ambassadorial recognition 
a foreign ministry announcement said that in agreement with 
the maintenance of friendly relations between states the greek 
government and the government of israel have decided to upgrade the 
status of their relative diplomatic representations to the status 
of embassies 
the announcement said representatives of both governments met 
monday in brussels and announced their new diplomatic status in a 
joint statement

a new study on how wolves might act in 
yellowstone national park was sent to congress on monday but one 
senator wont wait for that report to be dissected before 
legislating the predators return 
as summaries of the study were shipped to capitol hill word 
came from sen james mcclures office that the idaho republican 
would call this week for wolves to be transplanted to yellowstone 
as well as the frank churchriver of no return wilderness in 
central idaho 
in yellowstone meanwhile superintendent bob barbee hailed the 
586page study compiled by the national park service and us fish 
and wildlife service as the most thorough document yet on wolves 
us rep ron marlenee however called it poppycock 
they established where they wanted to get to and then did 
their study and made their evaluations so they could arrive at that 
point the montana republican said 
the study put together with information from wolf experts from 
throughout the world and researchers from three universities 
predicts little impact on wildlife or livestock near yellowstone if 
wolves are returned 
however it speculates that some wolves would leave 
yellowstones boundaries and have to be controlled by one means or 
another to protect livestock interests 
while some critics of the recovery plan fear wolves would 
decimate yellowstones big game herds the study said the available 
prey base was at least five times greater than that which 100 
wolves the ideal recovery population would be expected to 
reduce or even limit 
the study said at least 30 wolves would have to be released 
initially to assure the programs success it also suggested that 
wolves returned to yellowstone be considered a nonessential 
experimental population so biologists would have freer rein in 
controlling them than if they were covered by the full endangered 
species act 
it also calls for more studies on the predator and the park 
service has budgeted 175000 for that work this fiscal year 
bryce dustman press secretary for sen conrad burns a montana 
republican who is opposed to the wolf program said he wasnt 
surprised by the reports claim that wolves would have little 
effect on wildlife or livestock 
he said it jumped out at him that the two leading proponents 
of wolf restoration in yellowstone the park service and fish and 
wildlife service wrote a study saying the wolf wouldnt have a 
detrimental affect on livestock or big game

damaged her first donor liver up until that time she had been 
taking cyclosporine an antirejection medication that lowers the

bogotas swiss school many upperclass families send their 
children there 
the dynamite was in two large burlap bags on a sidewalk in front

tranquility won over tradition monday 
as a judge ordered that the hatfield town bell be silenced at 
night ruling in favor of a couple of newcomers who said the 
cherished custom kept them awake 
the ruling was greeted with relief by the couple and with dismay 
by townsfolk who had argued that the hourly chiming was a treasured 
part of the new england character of their 320yearold farming 
community 
i think its lousy selectman chairman george zgrodnick jr 
said after hampshire superior court judge john f murphy ordered 
that the 92yearold bell be turned off after 9 pm and before 7 
am 
a certain part of the heritage of the town has been disrupted 
and i think thats very important selectman thomas hurley said 
w michael ryan who represented newcomers richard and pamela 
carnall said the ruling effective immediately actually harks 
back to an old tradition of ringing the bell at curfew 
weve ended a 20thcentury tradition and revived a 
colonialfederalist era tradition ryan said 
the carnalls were unavailable for comment monday but ryan said 
he had spoken to them 
theyre pretty private people they have not enjoyed being in 
the public spotlight over this but they just felt that it was 
necessary to endure the publicity in order to obtain a relief he 
said 
zgrodnick said the ruling would mean turning off the bell all 
the time at least for now because the town doesnt have the funds 
for an automatic timer earlier the carnalls had offered to pay 
for such a device but ryan said the offer has been withdrawn 
the selectmen said it was too soon to tell if townsfolk would 
authorize money for an appeal but that it would be discussed 
the carnalls moved from nearby northampton in august 1988 and 
bought a 19thcentury house on main street across from the first

president hafez assad on monday snubbed 
an iraqi invitation to attend an arab league summit and reiterated 
it should be preceded by preparations in a meeting of foreign 
ministers an official said 
but assad made a conciliatory gesture toward baghdad and said he 
would stand by iraq in the event of an israeli attack 
earlier monday iraqi justice minister akram abdulqader arrived 
here carrying an invitation to the may 28 summit in baghdad from 
iraqi president saddam hussein 
abdulqader left for home after his meeting with assad the 
first visit by an iraqi official to syria since the two countries 
broke diplomatic relations in 1979 assad and saddam are heads of 
rival branches of the socialist baath party and are bitter enemies 
the feud deepened during the 198088 iraniraq war in which 
syria supported iran after the war ended saddam backed christian 
militias in lebanon against syriansupported moslem militias 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said assad 
supported the idea of the summit but reiterated syrias initial 
stand 
this was that the summits location and agenda must first be 
discussed at an emergency meeting of the foreign ministers of the 
22member arab league in tunisia he also has categorically 
rejected baghdad as a host location 
the foreign ministers are scheduled to meet tuesday in baghdad 
but the source said assads reply also stated that it must be 
clarified that independently from the issue of the summit syria 
will stand with all its might next to iraq or any other arab 
country exposed to israeli aggression 
in a related development lebanese premier salim hoss a close 
syrian ally informed the arab league that his country will not 
attend the baghdad summit a source in beirut said 
also monday palestine liberation organization chairman yasser 
arafats political and security adviser hani alhassan said he 
met with foreign minister farouk alsharaa sunday night in an 
attempt to convince syria to attend the summit 
palestine is very keen on syrias participation in the 
forthcoming summit and president arafat is trying his utmost to 
ensure an atmosphere of panarab understanding hassan told the 
associated press 
the syrianiraqi reconciliation is for us the cornerstone for 
building our confrontation with the israeli fascist rightwing 
he added 
the plo called for the summit to discuss the immigration of 
hundreds of thousands of soviet jews to israel which the plo views 
as a threat 
saddam said threats to iraqi security will also be on the 
agenda an issue syrian officials said they could not support 
saddam is seeking to rally support after britain and the united 
states accused iraq of trying to smuggle nuclear bomb triggers to 
baghdad iraq has denied it is developing nuclear weapons but 
threatened to use chemical weapons against israel if attacked 
the iraqis are also seeking to rally support after iraqbound 
shipments said to contain parts for a super gun capable of 
hitting israel were seized in britain greece turkey and italy

leftist rebel leaders said 
monday they reserve the right to launch another offensive if 
current peace talks with president alfredo cristianis rightist 
government fail to produce a ceasefire and agreement to end the 
decadeold war 
the warning was contained in a statement distributed here by the 
farabundo marti national liberation front the guerrilla 
organization also known as fmln shortly after representatives from 
both sides signed an agenda for peace negotiations in caracas the 
venezuelan capital 
the agenda signed after five days of talks commits the two 
sides to agree on a ceasefire by midseptember or earlier if 
political accords necessary for its implementation are reached 
before then 
the negotiators who met under the supervision of a united 
nations official also agreed to meet again to pursue the talks in 
midjune but it did not immediately specify the place or exact 
date 
the fmlns statement accused government troops of leading a 
nationwide offensive against guerrilla positions last week the 
director of the armed forces press office was unavailable for 
comment on the allegation 
fighting continued while the talks were going on in venezuela 
but daily reports during the past week did not seem to indicate a 
sharp increase in the conflict 
the fmln reiterates that as long is there is no ceasefire 
concerted by means of political accords and as long as there is no 
end to military impunity and no concrete commitments to the 
demilitarization of the country we reserve the legitimate right to 
defend ourselves the statement said 
it said this included launching of offensives of any size 
whenever they might be necessary anywhere in the country 
the fmln launched a large offensive against the capital and 
three other cities in november the biggest since the civil war 
began in october 1979 an estimated 2000 people were killed in the 
monthlong fighting

and killed three palestinians and wounded up to 112 on monday in 
violence set off by the massacre of seven palestinian laborers by 
an israeli civilian the day before

21yearold israeli discharged from the army as unfit and 
characterized by authorities as deranged and upset by an 
unhappy love affair police held him in custody and a judge 
ordered psychiatric tests 
in amman jordan a 28yearold palestinian with a pistol and a 
dagger wounded nine french tourists and a jordanian photographer on 
a tour bus police there said he was out to avenge sundays 
killings but did not elaborate 
thousands of palestinian demonstrators marched in protest toward 
the us embassy in amman and fought police who got in their way 
at least 20000 palestinian residents of baqaa refugee camp 
demonstrated and police used tear gas when the protesters tried to 
march to amman 17 miles away 
in washington about 75 demonstrators gathered near the state 
deparment and burned an effigy of israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir some waved palestinian flags and chanted palestinian 
statehood now 
smoke from burning tires rose above towns and refugee camps in 
the gaza strip home to the seven men gunned down sunday while 
waiting for day laborers jobs in a tel aviv suburb 
youths on rooftops hurled stones at army patrols women in 
traditional palestinian dress screamed and chanted as wounded 
victims were brought to the un clinic in this refugee camp 
arab reports listed 103 palestinians wounded in the gaza strip 
and nine shot and wounded in scattered clashes in the occupied west 
bank 
the army confirmed the three deaths and reported 40 palestinians 
were wounded in gaza it said it was checking the other reports 
arab leaders said the sunday massacre was the result of an 
antiarab atmosphere encouraged by shamirs hardline policies 
at a news conference in baghdad iraq yasser arafat asked 
president bush on monday to pressure israel to stop what arafat 
called atrocities against the palestinian people 
arafat chief of the palestine liberation organization rejected 
israeli claims that the lone gunman was mentally unbalanced and 
accused shamir of planning a criminal scheme against the 
palestinians and the intefadeh the palestinian uprising in the 
occupied lands 
the killings touched off riots in which seven more palestinians 
were killed by israeli soldiers on the floor of parliament on 
monday arab parliament member abdel wahab daroushe called fellow 
lawmakers murderers 
state department spokesman richard boucher criticized the 
israeli army for its handling of the riots sunday 
we are disturbed by the number of casualties inflicted by the 
israeli army boucher said in washington we have repeatedly 
called upon the government of israel to exercise restraint 
at least eight soldiers or police and two israeli civilians were 
reported injured by stones monday in gaza and israel where 
protests by arab citizens erupted in a halfdozen towns 
in the mixed arabjewish city of haifa swastikas were painted 
on walls in the northern town of nazareth a group of american 
tourists was stranded briefly inside a hotel as youths threw 
firebombs and burned tires 
maj gen matan vilnai commander of troops in gaza told 
reporters he was worried about an upsurge of revenge attacks on 
israelis because of the killings 
in jerusalems ein karem neighborhood 40yearold jewish 
restaurant owner yaacov shalom was slain sunday night reportedly 
by arabs 
police said it was unclear if the motive was political but the 
fundamentalist islamic jihad group claimed responsibility in an 
anonymous phone call in nicosia cyprus and said it was revenge 
for the sunday slayings 
mondays deaths raised to 705 the number of palestinians killed 
by israelis during the 29monthold palestinian uprising against 
israeli rule of the west bank and gaza strip fortythree israelis 
have been slain in the revolt and 216 palestinians have been 
killed by fellow arabs as suspected collaborators 
dan naveh the spokesman for foreign minister moshe arens said 
palestinian and other arab leaders were trying to exploit sundays 
killings by a crazed gunman 
we call on them to be restrained and not cynically use the 
tragic incident to fan the flames of violence he said in a 
statement 
survivors told reporters the gunman ordered a group of 50 
workers to sit in a line and then opened fire with an assault rifle 
the rioting that broke out later was the worst bloodshed in the 
uprising since april 15 1988 on that day 17 palestinians died in 
riots after plo military leader khalil wazir was slain in tunis 
reportedly by israeli commandos 
foreign minister moshe arens said the government had no 
responsibility for the attack sunday on the palestinian laborers 
in the united states very often similar incidents occur when 
a crazy person takes to the street and shoots people he said 
there is no connection with the government

a federal judge said monday he wants to know 
the highest level of authority that approved the alleged 
kidnapping of a mexican doctor charged in the murder of us drug 
agent enrique camarena 
us district judge edward rafeedie ordered government 
prosecutors to disclose the information at a hearing scheduled for 
friday on the manner in which dr humberto alvarez machain was 
brought to the united states for trial 
the alleged kidnapping of the guadalajara gynecologist april 2 
has strained relations between the united states and mexico 
mexican officials including president carlos salinas de gortari 
have called the operation a violation of their national sovereignty 
rafeedie has demanded to know how alvarez was brought here from 
mexico alvarezs trial has been indefinitely delayed pending the 
outcome of the hearing 
camarena 31 an agent for the us drug enforcement 
administration was kidnapped off a guadalajara street in february 
1985 testimony at the trial of three other men in 1988 showed that 
he was taken to a house and tortured and interrogated by drug 
lords then slain along with his pilot their bodies were found a 
month later on a ranch 65 miles outside guadalajara 
prosecutors maintain that alvarez gave camarena drugs to revive 
him for additional torture before his slaying 
three mexican men and a honduran currently are on trial for 
their alleged roles in the murder of camarena the pilot and two 
tourists who prosecutors say were mistaken for drug agents and 
slain 
at a status conference to discuss fridays hearing rafeedie 
referring to the alleged abduction told prosecutors id like to 
know the highest level of authority who authorized this 
outside court alvarezs lawyer robert steinberg said he would 
call four or five witnesses at the hearing among them he said 
would be antonio garate bustamante a former mexican police officer 
who has said he arranged the doctors abduction from his 
guadalajara office at the behest of the dea 
steinberg alleged that garate is wanted in mexico for a 1986 
murder and said the dea brought a killer here to hunt killers 
dea officials have vowed to capture and prosecute every person 
involved in the camarena murder 
steinberg said he would argue that rafeedie has no jurisdiction 
over the alvarez matter and should send it to the world court at 
the hague in the netherlands for resolution barring that he said 
the judge should order alvarez returned to mexico 
my basic motion is to send him home the attorney said 
give it to the mexican authorities and let them prosecute it if 
they wish

the us government monday agreed to pay manuel 
noriegas attorneys saying the ousted panamanian ruler should be 
assured a fair trial on drug charges 
the defense attorneys agreed to the deal offered by us 
attorney dexter lehtinen saying noriega would sign promises to pay 
the government back if 20 million in assets are released 
noriegas lawyers had threatened to withdraw from the case 
saying they could no longer function without money to pay for the 
complex and lengthy legal proceedings they wanted the government 
to release money from 27 noriega accounts frozen around the world 
assets prosecutors value at about 20 million 
the attorneys had subpoenaed pay records from the cia drug 
enforcement administration and other intelligence agencies to show 
noriega had income other than alleged drug bribes from colombias 
medellin drug cartel 
but at mondays hearing they asked that both the defense motion 
to withdraw from the case and the subpoenas be suspended until a 
formal fee arrangement was worked out the motion to withdraw and 
the subpoenas would then be dropped the defense team said 
federal prosecutors acknowledged monday that noriega received 
secret payoffs from us intelligence agencies but disputed defense 
figures that put the amount at 11 million the issue was expected 
to be the centerpiece of mondays hearing until the arrangement for 
the attorney fees was disclosed 
the prosecution wanted to avoid litigation that would get into 
matters having to do certainly with classified information with 
payments by our government and other governments to noriega 
defense attorney jon may said it was in their interests to do 
so 
lehtinen told us district judge william hoeveler during a 
hearing that the federal criminal justice act included provisions 
for the fee arrangement 
some cases are exceedingly complex some are extremely long 
said lehtinen it would be reasonable for counsel to be appointed 
by the court and those fees paid by the government 
the judge set at hearing for thursday to discuss details of the 
fees 
defense attorney frank rubino said he was satisfied with the 
proposal 
we do concur with them we think this particular section of 
the law may solve the problem in extreme cases of this nature 
he said 
rubino said noriega who was in court but did not testify 
agreed to sign affidavits declaring he was indigent and that if his 
assets were freed he would repay the federal government 
rubino has said noriega received 11 million from the united 
states for information about drug smuggling along with 6 million 
or 7 million from as yet unidentified foreign countries 
prosecutors acknowledge that the united states paid noriega but 
dispute the details 
the government believes that the amount is substantially less 
than that offered by the defense counsel diane cossin 
spokeswoman for the us attorneys office said monday i cannot 
be more specific because that information is not public 
one account alone in the united kingdom has about 10 million 
in it said defense attorney steven kollin under classified 
information rules governing the trial the attorneys could not say 
whose name was on the account but exchanges in court indicate it 
may be the name of noriegas wife 
there is money in that account and thats what were fighting 
for kollin said 
hoeveler had urged prosecutors to expedite action on the asset 
issue saying he views the question of attorneys fees as extremely 
important 
the judge has expressed skepticism of government claims that the 
money is all drugrelated saying as a military officer and leader 
of a country noriega must have had legitimate income 
noriega was indicted in february 1988 on charges of accepting 
46 million in bribes from the medellin cartel in exchange for 
turning panama into a safe haven and transit point to support 
cocaine smuggling into the united states 
he turned himself in to us authorities on jan 4 two weeks 
after the invasion of panama and was flown to florida where he is 
being held at the federal metropolitan correctional center outside 
of miami

environment minister lucien bouchard prime 
minister brian mulroneys chief lieutenant in quebec resigned 
monday dealing what may be a fatal blow to the meech lake accord 
on keeping quebec in the federation 
the 1987 accord a proposed constitutional amendment would give 
provinces special powers and recognize quebec as a distinct 
society within canada all 10 provinces by law have a june 23 
deadline to ratify the accord 
the constitutional dispute over the accord has revived 
independence talk in quebec a largely frenchspeaking province 
bouchard and mulroney agreed that bouchard would quit after an 
hourlong meeting at the prime ministers residence monday sources 
told the canadian press news agency 
bouchard 52 was considered the leader of the nationalists in 
the 61member quebec conservative caucus in parliament 
other quebec nationalists are likely to view his resignation as 
rejection of a special house of commons committee report 
recommending ratification of the meech lake accord and of added 
measures contained in a companion resolution 
bouchard got in trouble after sending a telegram of 
encouragement to the parti quebecois which in 1980 fought for an 
independent quebec 
mulroney counts bouchard among his oldest and closest political 
friends 
in a telegram sent to a parti quebecois meeting in alma quebec 
bouchard praised those who fought for an independent quebec during 
the 1980 referendum 
he refused to apologize for the telegram sunday after arriving 
from paris at mirabel airport outside montreal he said he was 
proud of having worked for sovereigntyassociation and praised 
former party leader rene levesque 
the telegram outraged opposition lawmakers in ottawa but was 
greeted with a standing ovation by party workers in alma after it 
was read aloud saturday by party leader jacques parizeau

vermont supreme court justice louis peck 
can remain on the bench even though he is past the states 
mandatory retirement age for judges a federal appeals court ruled 
monday 
the ruling by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals comes almost 
a year after peck was scheduled to be retired by the state because 
he had turned 70 
the state constitution calls on all judges to retire at age 70 
but peck had fought the provision saying it conflicted with a 
federal age discrimination law 
i feel like a condemned man who has had a reprieve said 
peck monday night after learning of the decision personally it 
is very satisfying 
peck now 71 said he will now give some thought to stepping 
down i may retire anyway he said 
the ruling by the new yorkbased federal appeals court settles 
the peck case but it does not settle the issue two other federal 
appeals courts the 8th circuit and 1st circuit have ruled the 
other way on the question which means judges in those 
jurisdictions must adhere to their states mandatory retirement 
provisions 
obviously congress has not made its intention clear if the 
court disagree said william gray the lawyer who represented the 
state of vermont in the suit against peck 
gray said it would be several weeks before the state decided 
whether it would appeal to the us supreme court 
taking away from states the power to decide when they retire 
their judges is a major shift of power from the states said gray 
thomas lehner the state court administrator said he had not 
seen the decision and would not comment until he had 
at issue was whether a federal law the federal age 
discrimination and employment act applied to appointed state 
judges the law prohibits age discrimination against most employees 
the state of vermont argued first that judges fit one of the 
exceptions appointees on the policymaking level and second 
that congress should not tell states how to set up their courts 
on the first argument the appeals court said appointed state 
judges do not fall under the exception congress meant to deny 
adea protection only to such appointees as would normally work 
closely with and be accountable to the official who appointed 
them the judges said 
on the second argument the judges said vermont had failed to 
show the federal law improperly trampled on the rights of the 
states there is no suggestion that congress surreptitiously 
enacted any legislation without notice to the state of vermont 
the court said 
the decision by the new yorkbased 2nd circuit counters rulings 
by the bostonbased 1st us circuit court of appeals and the st 
louisbased 8th us circuit court of appeals those federal 
appeals courts upheld state mandatory retirement provisions 
peck was appointed to the vermont supreme court in 1981 his 
current term expires in 1993 he turned 70 on dec 24 1988 
prompting lehner to place him on retirement status effective june 
30 1989 and prompting peck to file an age discrimination 
complaint with the eeoc which filed suit on his behalf last july 
us district judge lee gagliardi sided with peck prompting the 
appeal by the state to the 2nd circuit 
the vermont supreme court has five members it is the only 
appeals court in the state

<TEXT>
responding to a 51 percent decline in 
earnings during the first quarter mcclatchy newspapers inc says 
it is braced for more potential bad news this year and is cutting 
costs 
officials at the companys annual meeting may 16 blamed the 
decline on falling ad sales for newspapers across the country 
retail ad linage softened dramatically in march at most of our 
papers as it did throughout most of the country and resulted in a 
very disappointing first quarter said erwin potts president and 
chief executive officer of the company which publishes the 
sacramento bee and 18 other newspapers in four states 
treasurer james p smith said net firstquarter income fell from 
48 million in 1989 to 24 million in 1990 
smith also attributed the lower profits in part to interest 
expense from mcclatchys recent purchase of several south carolina 
papers and on startup costs for a newsprint mill in washington 
state 
we may yet take some tough hits before 1990 is over said 
potts if ad linage remains low we expect that things will 
rebound if not later this year then certainly next year 
on the positive side potts said circulation has continued to 
grow in the past five years at all mcclatchys major papers but 
one which is in an area of washington state hurt financially by 
the shutdown of a nuclear power plant

the sole investor in kansas citys 
new afternoon newspaper says he hopes to buck a national trend and 
attract enough readers for a profit analysts say thats going to 
be tough 
the first edition of the kansas city evening news rolled off the 
press may 14 
steve rose president of a familyowned chain of 18 suburban 
weekly papers and owner of the new 50cent tabloid said the paper 
sold about 22800 copies its first day 
media analysts contend the newspaper will face tough times 
because of a general decline in advertising revenues 
rose said he can make a profit through low costs small 
circulation and street sales the newspaper will not be delivered 
to homes 
he said hes not trying to compete directly with the kansas city 
star a morning paper with daily circulation of 297000 
rose said he got the idea for a newspaper in march when the 
kansas city star co stopped publishing an afternoon edition and 
merged it with the morning newspaper after years of declining 
afternoon circulation 
i dont want and i dont need 50000 to 100000 readers 
rose said if we start down that path suddenly all the economies 
change thats exactly where ralph ingersoll ended up 
ingersoll started the tabloid st louis sun to compete with the 
st louis postdispatch for morning readers but the sun shut down 
last month after only seven months ingersoll cited homedelivery 
costs and inadequate street sales 
roses newspaper unlike the much larger st louis sun has an 
editorial staff of four it will consist mostly of news from wire 
services 
the mondaythroughfriday paper shares a press building and 
other equipment with roses weeklies startup costs have been under 
1 million he said 
ken berents an analyst for alex brown amp sons inc in new york 
said starting a new newspaper in a town with a monopoly newspaper 
like kansas city is like running uphill with ankle weights on

threatened reporters with arrest if they published the names of 
people involved in the march trial of two juveniles

however the justices declined to rule on the constitutionality 
of the state law on which the circuit judges order was based 
the sioux falls argus leader and the associated press had argued 
that the law which prohibits the publication of names of people 
involved in juvenile court proceedings was an unconstitutional 
prior restraint on the news medias right to publish lawfully

charged with sex offenses in connection with a nov 28 incident at 
the governors mansion after the twoday trial the judge

agreement with united press international 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in reversing a lower 
courts decision said upi had shown that it would suffer 
irreparable harm if the arrangement were discontinued

and upi appealed 
three judges of the appeals court reversed leisure and directed 
him to issue the injunction which would remain in effect until the 
lawsuits are resolved 
the pictureexchange contract was made in 1984 and called for 
upi to supply reuters with photographs from the united states and 
for reuters to provide upi with pictures from other countries the 
agreement was to run for 10 years beginning in 1985 
reuters claimed the agreement is not living up to its 
expectations upi said it would lose clients and possibly go out of 
business without foreign photos from reuters

a bill that would require florida 
editorial writers to disclose their finances appears to be dead 
although the sponsor may make a lastditch effort to salvage it 
some lawmakers thought the measure sponsored in the house by 
orlando republican bruce mcewan was nothing more than a shot at 
the press 
as much as i might want to get in there and make a little jab 
at editorial boards i think the greater freedom of expression is 
more important said rep john cosgrove dmiami 
the bill would include newspaper editorial board members in a 
current law requiring many state employees to file statements 
disclosing their financial interests or face a 5000 fine it 
would also require all editorials to be signed by the authors 
the bill drew widespread interest from newspaper executives 
across the country who saw it as one of the most blatant attempts 
at pressbashing in recent memory said dick shelton executive 
director of the florida press association 
we felt they legislators were peeved at the press and wanted 
to get the press attention shelton said i think the 
attention they got was dismay that our legislators would consider 
something so obviously unconstitutional 
the measure narrowly won approval in early may in a house 
subcommittee but mcewan was unable to convince the judiciary 
committee to forward it onto the floor

the city public works director and two 
other men lost a 15 million libel suit against the laredo morning 
times on may 11 
a state district court jury concluded that the reputation of 
public works director joe guerra was damaged in the first of four 
times articles about a candidates claim that city equipment was 
used improperly 
but the jury awarded no damages holding that the offending 
article did not constitute actual malice nor did the newspaper 
act with reckless disregard for the truth the jury said 
guerra felix de leon and guadalupe f gonzalez sued the times 
and one of its editors in connection with articles published oct 
1720 1985 
the jury found that all four articles were substantially true 
and the subject was of public concern 
the times contended that the first article merely reported what 
occurred at a news conference the previous day when mayoral 
candidate victor solis alleged that a road grader was used to grade 
the parking lot of a night club as a political favor to the 
incumbent mayor and two others 
de leon was identified in the first article as the owner of the 
property where the improvements were made gonzalez actually owned 
the property 
the jury found that three followup articles in which guerra and 
other city officials denied the allegations did not libel guerra 
and that none of the articles identified gonzalez

the first amendment doesnt exempt 
reporters from the obligation of testifying about crimes they 
witness floridas supreme court said in rejecting an appeal by the 
miami herald 
while we are mindful of the importance of a vigorous and 
aggressive press we fail to see how compelling a reporter to 
testify concerning his eyewitness observations of a relevant event 
in a criminal proceeding in any way chills or impinges on the 
newsgathering process justice parker lee mcdonald wrote for the 
majority 
the herald floridas largest newspaper hasnt decided if it 
will appeal the may 17 decision said attorney samuel terilli jr 
he said the ruling would have a limited impact because it was 
written to cover only a narrow specific set of circumstances 
it applies only to reporters who have eyewitnessed crimes 
searches and similar events in criminal cases and that just 
doesnt happen too often terilli said 
reporter joel achenbach was subpoenaed by an attorney for a new 
york man arrested on drug smuggling charges at the miami 
international airport achenbach was accompanying three metrodade 
police officers at the time as part of his research for an article 
details of the search and arrest in achenbachs story differed 
from police reports 
a state trial court and floridas 3rd district court of appeal 
rejected the heralds argument that the first amendment to the us 
constitution extended to achenbach a qualified privilege to refuse 
to divulge information obtained firsthand as a witness to an event 
in a criminal case

reporters and editors at the orange 
county register in santa ana calif tend to avoid pat riley as 
the papers ombudsman rileys sunday column often outlines his 
colleagues mistakes 
writing a column means you have a less pleasant relationship 
with the staff because you have to put someones name in the 
column riley said may 14 as the organization of news ombudsmens 
conference opened 
henry mcnulty of the hartford conn courant said the groups 
intials ono reflect the attitude of colleagues when they see an 
ombudsman coming oh no what have i done now said mcnulty 
the readers are quite sophisticated about the media and they 
are quick to point out errors or biases said charles bond of the 
palm beach post in west palm beach fla 
kerry sipe of the virginianpilot said newspapers are following 
the trend of responsiveness to the consumer just as an oil 
company is held responsible by the consumer for its oil spills so 
a newspaper is asked to take responsibility for what it does and 
clean up after itself when it errs he said 
riley said most of the registers staff treat the matter 
professionally we criticize everybody else in the world and i 
think the staff though theyre not always pleased realizes we 
have to be subject to the same criticism he said 
the ombudsmen agreed there are some issues such as abortion on 
which they have no easy answers mcnulty said he gets about the 
same number of complaints from prolife advocates as from 
prochoice advocates claiming a story was biased against them 
we listen but at the same time we dont let those criticisms 
dampen or curtail our coverage we still consider ourselves news 
people we will still cover the stories riley said 
there are no solutions to some complaints about stories but 
what is important is that there is a twoway communication between 
the reader and the newspaper with that comes the hope that the 
paper is hearing what the reader is saying mcnulty said

secondlargest newspaper after el tiempo of bogota 
medellins two newspapers el mundo and el colombiano have

cities and the traffickers will not quit until they destroy el 
espectador 
this is the most dramatic and successful attack on press 
freedom i have ever heard of he said in other countries you 
might get killed for what you write but here they murder you just 
for working

el espectador announced after the murder that the paper no 
longer would circulate in antioquia state and its capital medellin

public televisions the macneillehrer 
newshour features more whites and males and is more 
governmentoriented and conservative than abcs nightline says 
a group that studied both shows 
the assertion was made by a liberal media watchdog group 
fairness amp accuracy in reporting in a study released may 20 fair 
president jeff cohen said the pbs show has a narrow 
proestablishment guest list that mocks the original mandate of 
public television to provide diversity 
newshour executive producer les crystal said the news 
program agrees that diversity is important and we clearly feel we 
can and should do better in that regard 
but he disputed what he called fairs contention that the show 
doesnt criticize the government much and asks onesided questions 
the fair study of newshour broadcasts from feb 6 to aug 4 
1989 was conducted by boston college sociologists william hoynes 
and david croteau who made a study critical of nightline last 
year 
the nightline report examining 40 months of the abc 
program from 1985 to 1988 found that 89 percent of its guests were 
men 92 percent were white and that conservative leaders were the 
shows most frequent guests 
fairs new study entitled all the usual suspects 
macneillehrer and nightline also compared abcs program with 
newshour during the same sixmonth period the latter was 
studied 
the two professors making the study found that abcs show has 
slightly broadened its guest list since the original study but 
that our hopes for significant change were not met 
their newshour study found that of us citizens appearing 
as guests 90 percent of them were white and 87 percent were male 
the figures rose on programs about international politics it said 
with 94 percent of us citizens appearing to discuss world 
politics being both white and male 
the study offered no racial or gender percentages for guests who 
were not us citizens 
it characterized as more representative the guests invited 
when the shows topic was domestic politics it said that 26 
percent of them were women but gave no figures on the race of 
female guests 
fairs study said the shows guest list was dominated by two 
conservative washington think tanks with a total of 14 guests 
provided by the center for strategic and international studies and 
the american enterprise institute

news organizations asked the illinois 
supreme court on may 18 to allow cameras and microphones in the 
states trial courts 
the best way for the public to have confidence in its judicial 
system is to see whats going on said richard thies an attorney 
for illinois news broadcasters association one of the petitioners 
before 1984 cameras and microphones werent allowed in any 
state courts but that year the supreme court opened the doors of 
appellate courts 
the justices decided to keep cameras and microphones out of the 
trial courts because of fears that miscarriages of justice will 
result from the subtle insidious effect that televising trials 
will have upon the behavior of the participants in court 
proceedings former justice robert underwood wrote at the time 
when that decision was made 30 states allowed cameras and 
microphones in trial courts now 37 states allow cameras and 
microphones in trial courts and thies said the experience of those 
states has shown camera coverage doesnt affect the outcome of 
trials 
electronic coverage of trials would help guarantee due process 
by encouraging public scrutiny of trials thus acting as a direct 
check on abuse of the judicial process he wrote in the brief 
submitted to the high court 
thies said news organizations are hoping the supreme court will 
adopt a rule similar to new yorks test program 
the new york rule allows microphones and cameras in trial courts 
but prohibits taping of rape victims jurors and undercover 
officers it also prohibits audio coverage of conferences among 
attorneys clients and the judge 
thies said he didnt expect the court to rule on his request 
before next year 
other petitioners are wls television inc wmaqtv the illinois 
broadcasters association the illinois press photographers 
association and the illinois freedom of information council

space telescope was supposed to be just an engineering test but it 
surprised scientists by revealing an unsuspected double star 
hubbles inaugural photo sequence taken from its orbit 381 
miles above the earth showed bright crisp stars against a black 
background with much clearer images than seen in a picture taken 
by a groundbased telescope of the same part of the heavens 
fantastic james westphal the principal scientist for the 
camera used in the first photo exercise said sunday we are just 
as pleased as punch at this point our image is significantly 
better than we were concerned that it might be 
westphal said the hubble pictures clearly show that an image 
which appeared in groundbased photos to be only a single star was 
in fact a rare binary star the space telescope pictures showed 
two overlapping points of light instead of a single blob as seen 
in a picture taken by a chilean observatory

president bushs budget summit scenario points 
up a problem the democrats could encounter after the negotiations 
on debt and taxes if and when there is a deal to curb the 
deficit it will bear the presidential seal 
despite the clamor over the presidents easing of his ban 
against new taxes a settlement could turn out to be an asset for 
the white house democrats have been arguing all year that 
unrealistic assumptions in the administration budget would lead to 
a midyear deficit crunch with a threat of automatic spending cuts 
that would cripple federal programs next fall just before the 
elections 
that and the soaring unbudgeted cost of the savings and loan 
bailout led to what bush now calls an urgent problem and to the 
budget talks he convened the negotiations resume today 
it will take weeks perhaps months but those talks will produce 
some sort of settlement because neither party can afford to led 
them fail 
a top administration official assessing the prospect on 
condition he not be identified by name said politicians wont want 
the issue loose during the fall election campaign when positions 
will harden and congressional challengers will demand to know what 
incumbents are going to do about taxes and federal spending 
programs 
when there is a deal bush will preside over the announcement 
session sharing the platform with democratic leaders offering 
thanks and praise hailing their bipartisanship for all that the 
presidents voice is the one that counts politically 
in the event that his voice overrules his lips and accepts new 
taxes it will be embarrassing how embarrassing and for how long 
will depend on the shape of the whole package a true longterm 
compromise that really does cut deficits would be a plus for all 
parties to the talks 
theres also the question of what new taxes what they would 
cost and who would pay the administration official said that in a 
50 billion settlement that split deficit reduction between 
spending cuts and new revenues less than 5 billion in additional 
taxes might be enough he said the administration budget already 
includes 194 billion in new revenues the white house doesnt 
call them taxes 
but the democrats are determined that he will before this deal 
is done 
they had hoped to prod bush into addressing the nation on the 
budget crunch worsened by slipping revenues and rising interest 
rates along with the savings and loan bailout they argued that it 
would be difficult to sell harsh budget measures to the voters 
unless bush made the case for action at the first session in the 
budget talks last tuesday he declined to do so 
he said later that there will be a time for prime time but not 
now i want to go out when we have a bipartisan answer to the 
problem say heres what the problem is and heres the answer 
im not going to go out there and try to do something that 
might inadvertently suggest crisis and frighten markets he told 
a news conference 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota senior republican on the budget 
committee said that in urging a nationally televised presidential 
address on the budget problem the democrats were trying to push 
bush to do what jimmy carter did in what came to be known as his 
malaise speech a catalogue of troubles that dragged him down 
politically 
while democrats would like hear bush proposals and have the 
voters hear them too the president said that to make 
recommendations in public would breach his promise that the 
administration would bargain on the budget with no preconditions 
that makes vagueness a virtue 
bush said he wasnt out to trick or blindside anybody but he 
told democrats who challenged him to go first on proposing answers 
to wait one minute congress is responsible for appropriating 
money and raising revenues 
so lets not talk about going first we got a problem he 
said im going to try to keep my share of the bargain by not 
discussing what we might do or might not do what my bottom line 
is what my opening wedge is 
then he said quoting lyndon b johnson lets reason 
together and try to get a deal that should keep the democrats 
alert they know that when lbj reasoned his way to a deal it 
usually was on his terms

its been 15 years since the fall of saigon and 
still the movies about the war keep coming 
most are bad a few are firstrate and some are wellintended 
efforts that just dont hit the mark 
the last would best describe last flight out an nbc movie 
based on the real story of the last refugeepacked pan american 
flight out of saigon six days before the fall of the city and south 
vietnam to north vietnamese forces 
it stars richard crenna as pan am pilot dan hood and james earl 
jones as al topping the airlines saigon station manager two men 
who exist and who defied the rules in a good cause in the panicky 
days near the end of the war 
their joint efforts got 463 people most of them vietnamese 
orphans pan ams vietnamese employees and endangered vietnamese 
who worked for the us embassy during the war on pam ams last 
jumbo jet flight out of the country 
an incredible story unfortunately this filmedinthailand 
effort airing tonight seems oddly flat 
save for a few moments it doesnt really convey the feeling of 
urgency confusion and panic that preceded the fall of saigon 
even its scenes depicting the citys streets and marketplaces 
seem unbelievably calm you keep wondering if director larry 
elikann studied news clips of saigon in its last frenzied days to 
see what it was like 
another big problem is that walter halsey davis script tries to 
dovetail too many stories into two hours 
in addition to the stories of topping and hood theres also 
that of jim eckes arliss howard a continental airlines employee 
in saigon who ran an unofficial evacuation effort 
theres also tra duong rosalind chao a vietnameseborn pan am 
flight attendant trapped in saigon while trying to get her family 
out 
thats crowded enough but theres also a fictional us state 
department type larry rose eric bogosian flying back from 
washington on his own to help vietnamese friends lowlevel 
employees of the united states in saigon 
the starting point for last flight out is the flight into 
saigon of rose and hood 
the latter is coming in to help a civilian doctor friend at the 
american hospital cope with a flood of orphans injured in the crash 
of an air force c5 jumbo jet during operation babylift an effort 
to evacuate 2000 orphans 
amazingly that crash which killed more more than 75 orphans 
and 50 americans is only vaguely mentioned in the movie such 
vagueness happens elsewhere and is another major flaw of the movie 
despite some fine moments particularly the americans 
frustration with a vietnamese bureaucrat who refuses to believe the 
war is lost last flight out seems strangely disconnected from 
the war its trying to depict 
and about the only actor who really makes an impression is 
howard superb as a very compassionate man albeit one so cynical 
hell say of the south vietnamese officer corps as that countrys 
army collapses 
i believe the current penalty for desertion is a life sentence 
in switzerland with a numbered account 
but youre never sure of exactly what eckes does is he a pilot 
an executive a mechanic its never made clear and it seems 
strange that no one noticed this before filming began 
you have to give credit to to nbc and the sponsor atampt for 
making the effort that led to last flight out 
but the film just doesnt work too bad it might have been 
memorable had its maker done a little more homework and a whole lot 
more plotpruning

so there really is a credit crunch after all 
despite the federal reserves earlier comment that it could find 
none in its regular data 
this crunch however seems not to be directly managed by the 
fed whose job it is to regulate the flow of funds to the banks 
and therefore to the economy it is managed instead by the banks 
themselves 
it is you might say a privatesector clampdown one in which 
the banks have funds available to them but arent making funds 
available to businesses especially small ones and those involved 
with commercial real estate 
the information from a survey by the fed itself tends to 
resolve what had seemed to be a contradiction small businesses 
complaining they couldnt get sufficient credit but the fed 
indicating it wasnt tightening the flow 
regardless of the source business again feels it is victimized 
it makes no difference who is the source of their distress the 
feds or the bankers since the impact is the same 
operators of small businesses especially say it is an old story 
recalling that just a decade ago the prime lending rate rose to 
215 percent for the very best corporate customers for small 
businesses it was more like 25 percent 
that 1981 crunch was federal reservegenerated and many 
businesses ranging from proprietorships to some with sales close 
to 50 million a year succumbed or were bought up it was one of 
the worst recessions ever 
in fact by some measures the early 1980s recession was the 
deepest since the great depression of the 1930s a debacle some 
historians say was worsened when the fed tightened up early in that 
decade and loosened too late 
some business people still argue in fact that the doubledigit 
interest rates that developed in the late 1970s were due as much to 
fed miscalculation as to the robustness of business and consumer 
spending 
first the critics say the fed allowed too much credit into the 
economy and then it clamped down with unnecessary harshness but 
inflation was roaring and that meant higher interest rates were 
required they said 
you still cant sell that argument to some fed critics they 
contend that inflation then wasnt a result of consumer and 
business demand straining the nations capacity to produce they 
say it was eurodollars 
eurodollars are us dollars made abroad when americans import 
more than they export european banks which hold the dollars make 
dollardenominated loans based on the dollars they have on deposit 
dollars flood the world 
the fed the critics say restrained the us economy by 
limiting the ability of business to borrow but the creation of 
dollars by foreign banks was left unregulated it was those 
dollars they say that created inflation 
now the crackdown seems to be by the banks themselves according 
to the fed survey the fed itself has not tightened up on the money 
supply in fact it says it decided not to raise interest rates at 
a policy meeting in march 
why should the banks be cautious that answer too is an old one 
because they are worried having made bad loans that must be worked 
off the books foreign loans now essentially uncollectable and 
bad real estate loans 
and smaller businesses those not on the fortune lists and most 
of them not likely ever to be there are feeling the pinch nothing 
new in that either any smallbusiness person can show you the 
welts left by earlier crackdowns 
it matters not whether it is the federal reserve or a 
privatesector lender who does the whipping the welts are the same 
color

beijing college students who led the 
prodemocracy movement last spring say june 4 will be a difficult 
day 
for some the empty bunk in their tiny concrete dorm room will 
remind them again of a roommate who was killed that day arrested 
soon afterward or has fled the country or gone underground 
the day will be even harder to get through because they cannot 
show outward signs of mourning or hold memorial services for those 
the government calls counterrevolutionaries 
in general few people speak readily of thee 
64 incident code words for the democracy movement and the 
military crackdown a year ago 
most have simply put it behind them saying they have to 
continue with turmoil or ththeir lives 
but even if people dont realize the anniversary is 
approaching theyll know it just by the signs around them like 
all the extra police a young intellectual said 
students say the day will not pass unmarked 
well have some memorial activity individually whatever 
each person is able to do a sophomore at beijing university said 
the present situation and environment doesnt allow us to take 
any kind of action but as long asgotten so excited about 
anything she said now theres nothing that can make me 
excited or happy 
almost no one believes anything will happen june 4 
students arent going to make trouble just for the sake of 
making trouble a beijing university senior said but the 
students also say many are ready to join another protest 
right now the only thing thats lacking is a leader one 
said but who would dare to be a leader

the sleek elevator at the exchange square 
office tower begins its ascent with yet another group of people who 
hope the short ride up is the start of a journey leading out 
twelve a disembodied voice announces as the doors slide 
open the passengers step out turn and stride through the double 
glass doors of the consulate where an inviting sign says canada 
welcomes immigrants 
the main point is 1997 we want some insurance said a 
40yearold mechanical engineer who came with his wife and two 
children to pick up an immigration form that is the year britain 
hands hong kong back to china 
a year after horrified residents of the crown colony watched 
their communist rulerstobe crush the democracy movement in 
beijing with military force the desire to escape hong kongs 
uncertain future shows no sign of abating 
the exodus is the most visible sign that the fabric of hong kong 
society is unraveling in the aftermath of june 4 1989 and the 
approach of 1997 
there is a growing feeling that one of the worlds great 
economic success stories may be nearing its end forecasts for this 
territory of 57 million people have taken a turn for the worse 
after the fourth of june massacre china has not done anything 
at all to try to restore confidence in hong kong said martin 
lee a liberal member of the legislature i think what the 
chinese leaders have done has been pretty destructive of any hope 
of a bright future here 
those actions include strident denunciations of hong kongs 
support for the beijing prodemocracy movement and the arrests in 
china of hong kong residents accused of smuggling dissidents out 
chinas new constitution for post1997 hong kong also causes 
worry critics claim an antisubversion clause and a provision 
allowing beijing to declare a state of emergency in hong kong could 
be used to muzzle dissent 
the constitution is supposed to guarantee that hong kong can 
maintain capitalism for 50 years and enjoy a high degree of 
autonomy but it does not provide for a popularly elected chief 
executive or a fully elected legislature 
bickering over hong kong between beijing and london has been 
unsettling china has objected to a british nationality plan under 
which 50000 important hong kong residents and their families would 
be offered citizenship 
beijing has indicated it may not recognize foreign passports 
held by hong kong chinese who make up most of the population 
analysts say china is trying to scare away anyone who could be 
considered a troublemaker 
among those leaving are many of the bright generally apolitical 
middleclass who have helped make hong kong one of asias 
economically powerful little dragons 
they include mr poon 40 who spent two decades reaching the 
top in the insurance industry and is giving it up in august to take 
his wife and young daughter to vancouver canada 
i think everyone in hong kong can be sure our freedom will be 
restrained said poon who asked to be identified only by his 
surname my decision to leave hong kong is solely because of 
1997 
the poons will be among about 55000 emigrating this year up 
from an average 20000 a few years ago 
we expect this to continue right up to 1997 said colin 
robertson of the canadian consulate which issued 22130 
immigration visas last year 
hong kongs immigration department also issued 1647 permits 
allowing residents to take the remains of deceased relatives with 
them more than double the 1985 figure 
some emigrants leave behind aging parents or the mentally 
retarded said dr leonard lee a psychiatrist at queen marys 
hospital 
they were using us as a dumping place in some of the cases 
he said some of the abandoned elderly have attempted suicide or 
turned to alcohol and drugs 
a western analyst speaking anonymously said the brain drain 
could make hong kong less efficient in the way it carries out 
business the way it governs itself and the way it maintains 
order 
that is a chilling prospect for hong kong which sees itself as 
the model of efficiency in this part of the world 
a survey of government doctors last fall found that 40 percent 
had applied for emigration and many more were considering it 
certainly we are very worried said dr ho shiuwei of the 
1100member overnment doctors association we can see that 
there will be a drop in the level of experience 
ho said patients may have to wait longer for care and were 
very afraid that even if we can keep the doctors there will be no 
nurses around its very easy for them to emigrate 
more than half the 49 multinational corporations that responded 
to a survey by business international a consulting firm said they 
might move their regional offices from hong kong 
persistent high inflation and a dramatic slowing of economic 
growth have exacerbated the political crisis 
after backtoback annual growth of 14 and 7 percent hong 
kongs gross domestic product rose only 25 percent last year and 
is not expected to do much better in 1990 
there are fears that labor relations will deteriorate bus 
drivers and firemen struck recently nurses and civil servants have 
threatened to do so 
holding the territory together until 1997 is the job of a 
colonial administration some observers believe may be forced to 
leave early 
the final ebbing of hope combined with the perception that 
britain is not acting in hong kongs interest may disrupt the 
british governments wish to preside until 1997 and depart with 
dignity george hicks a local businessman and alvin rabushka of 
the hoover institutution wrote in the asian wall street journal 
seven years is too long to expect hong kong to remain 
quiescent they said a peaceful handover in 1997 can be

political oppression at home and a bloodied image 
abroad are the legacy of that night a year ago when chinese 
soldiers opened fire on prodemocracy students and their supporters 
chinas aging communist party leaders regained their slipping 
hold on power the night of june 34 when they ordered troops to 
capture tiananmen square and end a sevenweek drive for democratic 
reform by the students occupying it 
what they lost by that decision has extended far beyond the 
hundreds perhaps thousands of people killed in the streets of 
beijing 
the crackdown has cost china billions of dollars in reduced or 
suspended foreign investment credit aid and tourism 
it alienated millions of chinese perhaps irreversibly it 
brought to power leaders who have halted new economic reform in 
favor of the central planning now being discarded elsewhere in the 
world 
a year after tiananmen thousands of activists still are 
imprisoned without charges or trial astrophysicist fang lizhi 
chinas leading dissident and his wife are still fugitives in the 
us embassy branded counterrevolutionaries 
zhao ziyang the reformist party leader purged for allegedly 
supporting the students remains under house arrest martial law 
was lifted in january but paramilitary police and troops are 
highly visible reminders that further unrest will be crushed 
instantly 
premier li peng and new communist party chief jiang zemin say 
china is stable and united and that further demonstrations are not 
possible but diplomatic or political normality remains beyond 
their grasp 
chinese leaders are surprised that after a year the west still 
is united in its tough stance in a recent interview on american 
television jiang said western anger over the brutal repression was 
much ado about nothing 
except for two secret controversial visits to beijing last year 
by brent scowcroft president bushs national security adviser the 
west has generally held to limited economic sanctions and a ban on 
highlevel visits 
the west still is holding up approval of international 
development loans except those for human needs 
some smaller commercial loans have been made but in march the 
world bank rejected 150 million in credit for road building in 
eastern china the asian development bank under us pressure and 
with japans assent has yet to lift a freeze on 490 million in 
loans 
economic retrenchment and political repression have killed for 
now chinas efforts to enter the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade bush is likely to face a bruising battle in congress if he 
decides to continue its mostfavorednation trading status 
beijings reaction to foreign criticism has been confused and 
defensive chinese leaders insist the economic reforms and the open 
door policy that senior leader deng xiaoping initiated in 1979 are 
intact and foreign investors are welcomed eagerly 
the climate for investment is unprecedentedly better than at 
any time in the past and especially better than the time before 
last june mayor zhu rongji of shanghai said this month in 
promoting a local development project 
the government has made several gestures in recent months 
mainly cosmetic aimed at improving relations with the west it 
restored the fulbright and peace corps programs with the united 
states lifted martial law in tibet and most recently released 
211 political prisoners 
but chinese leaders still blame western influence for the 
democratic impulses of last year and are using antiwestern 
rhetoric not heard since the xenophobic cultural revolution days in 
196676 
foreign forces hostile to china that engage in subversive 
activities are bound to fail premier li told the national 
legislature in march come what may socialist china will stand 
rock firm in the east 
china has dredged up the 1840 opium war with britain as an 
example of western imperialism launched an antipornography 
campaign that includes the banning of foreign books and accused 
intellectuals of bourgeois liberal western bias 
its leaders have refused to express regret for the many lives 
lost in the assault on tiananmen square and insist the campaign for 
democratic reform was a counterrevolutionary rebellion 
instigated by outside agitators 
few foreign businessmen left china and foreign banks again are 
granting loans but new investment remains sluggish 
after june 4 there was a perception of a fundamental shift in 
political power said john frisbie of the united stateschina 
business council 
certainty was replaced by a question mark about the direction 
of chinese policy and if there is one thing investors dont like 
it is uncertainty 
in hong kong uncertainty about the future has led to a flight 
of talent about 1000 people mainly professionals emigrate every 
week from the british colony which reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
the desire to escape is pervasive among the educated young in 
china but few can do it the government now limits overseas study 
to older scholars with proven ideological credentials generally 
for shortterm programs 
because of their dim prospects many of the young fall into 
hedonism or political apathy 
a few students said they would mark the june 4 anniversary by 
privately toasting the dead or wearing black the western color of 
mourning or white the chinese color but demonstrators face 
certain arrest and nobody is going to be charging out into the 
streets a diplomat said 
ideological education party propaganda and surveillance have 
increased dramatically in the past year on campuses and in 
factories 
the entire freshman class at beijing university which was a 
hotbed of student activism will be shipped off this fall for a 
year of military training as was the case in 1989 at least two 
other major universities are starting similar programs 
artists and writers instructed to advance communist goals have 
stopped producing journalists who had their brief taste of press 
freedom during the prodemocracy movement have returned to 
churning out party tracts and praise for model factories and farms 
besides thousands of chinese languishing in prisons many 
thousands more have had to make selfcriticisms face reduced 
career opportunities or lost their jobs for participating in or 
supporting the democracy movement 
all 48 million members of the communist party have been told to 
reregister as part of an effort to weed out those with 
bourgeois tendencies 
the government has carried out a wellpublicized campaign 
against official corruption a key issue in nonstudent support for 
last years demonstrations and 20monthlong austerity program has 
reduced inflation 
there have been isolated reports of strikes as a prolonged 
economic slump causes layoffs and pay cuts but the government 
appeal for stability has won grudging support in a nation that 
traditionally fears internal chaos 
were not adventurous like westerners said a young office 
worker in wuhan central china we want the situation to be 
stable 
the communist party insists china can achieve stability and 
prosperity only under its leadership and the communist system but 
has adopted a crisis mentality since tiananmen and the downfall of 
communist governments in europe 
young people joining the party see it mainly as an avenue to 
better jobs and more comfort cynicism among educated party members 
is up twentyfold since june the western diplomat said 
a party document in march warned of the danger of alienation 
from the masses if the party does not use its power properly 
and consciously resist the corrosive influence of the decaying 
ideologies of the bourgeois and other exploiting classes 
the party also faces the uncertainty of what will happen after 
the death of deng xiaoping the man responsible for both the 1979 
economic reforms and the 1989 political crackdown deng is 85 and 
thought to be in frail health 
premier li peng a hardliner blamed for last years bloodshed 
is not popular and jiang zemin party chief since june lacks a 
power base in beijing the military linked to president yang 
shangkun has a far greater political role since the army was 
ordered into beijing and will be an important factor 
one point of consensus emerges from the factional maneuvering 
stopping the democracy movement was a matter of survival for the 
party 
they had to crush the demonstrations an asian diplomat 
said otherwise they were gone

editors note the days of wine and roses and hostesses with 
the mostest have departed the washington scene reading george 
bushs lips capital social life is texmex flicks and popcorn on 
the side 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after the hollywood glitz of the reagan years 
the washington social scene under george bush seems as flat as last 
nights champagne and as boring as the last guest to leave the 
party 
blacktie parties for jetsetting glitterati from beverly hills 
have given way to folksy barbecues at camp david and cozy evenings 
of popcorn and movies at the white house for a few close friends 
jelly beans are out texmex junk food is in leave the bill 
blass gown in the closet and grab a ralph lauren sweater for 
kennebunkport scratch that candlelit soiree in georgetown the 
presidents heading for the horseshoe pit 
the social whirl in short is gurgling down the drain 
what social scene asks robin weir former hairdresser to 
nancy reagan and her california friends 
bemoaning the decline in star quality of his salons clientele 
weir sniffed weve gone from betsy bloomingdale to roseanne 
barr 
jayne ikard wife of a former texas congressman and a fixture on 
the local party circuit for 20 years says her waistline tells the 
story 
lets just say i gained 8 pounds during the first month of the 
reagan administration and this year im staying on an even keel 
im not gaining and im not losing 
no one is complaining about george and barbara bush who are 
popular and energetic hosts but times have changed the reagans 
are basking in the golden west and the grande dames of society 
have gone the way of dance cards and white gloves the nights 
belong to the nouveau riche whose ideas of fun is throwing a 
charity ball 
when bush took office everyone eagerly awaited the emergence of 
georgette mosbacher wife of commerce secretary robert mosbacher 
as washingtons hostess with the mostest 
but mrs mosbacher perhaps wary of dipping her toe in the shark 
pool stayed in new york to run her cosmetics business the other 
prime candidate penne korth a bush pal from texas who cochaired 
his inaugural shipped out as ambassador to mauritius 
its as though somebody unplugged the jacuzzi and we were all 
sitting there wet and waiting for the action to start said 
society columnist diana mclellan the whole feeling of the city 
has changed enormously 
whats different is that the epicenter of the capitals social 
life has shifted to the white house where the gregarious 
funloving bushes are setting the pace with their own parties 
receptions and yall come on over evenings with family and old 
friends 
the bushes know everybody said mrs mclellan theyve 
been here a long time and they know all the players mrs ikard 
compares capital society under the reagans and the bushes by 
saying its the difference between a flirtation and courtship 
and a stable happy marriage 
says gretchen poston former social secretary under president 
carter this is a very serious white house and theyre not going 
out to dinner parties like the reagans the bushes focus is on the 
home 
its a far cry from 1981 when the reagans came to town with a 
galaxy of social luminaries the walter annenbergs william french 
smiths caspar weinbergers charles z wicks to excite the most 
jaded partygoers 
bush an old washington hand ushered in the 90s with a cabinet 
full of old familiar faces his idea of a surprise was john 
sununu the white house chief of staff and former new hampshire 
governor who is something less than a party animal 
john who not even the social sets pricey facelifts could hide 
the frowns of dismay 
the bushes are wellliked and they entertain in a warm 
gracious manner says barbara gamarekian of the new york times 
but washington feeds on new faces and personalities and after 
eight years of the reagans people got tired of guest lists with 
the same names over and over again 
everyone was looking for a change and they didnt get it 
she said 
in truth washington has grown up urban sprawl is rampant 
traffic is getting impossible distant cow pastures have been 
bulldozed for milliondollar mansions tiffany the jewel of new 
yorks fifth avenue has branched into a suburban virginia shopping 
mall 
long gone is the sleepy southern town where the oldmoney 
doyennes of high society entertained a small circle of friends at 
lavish dinner parties sprinkled with senators cabinet members 
diplomats and olympian newspaper pundits 
nobody has filled the vacuum left by the late perle mesta and 
gwendolyn cafritz the legendary washington hostesses who made 
headlines by catering to the powerful todays careerminded 
congressional and cabinet wives show little interest in playing the 
hostess game 
the reason things are so dull is that nobody has come to town 
with the ambition to rise above the crowd and fill that role 
said society watcher charlotte hays of the washington times 
the hottest invitation in town these days arrives in a white 
house envelope or in a casual telephone call from george or 
barbara bush 
everyone wants to be on the guest list for those very small 
very intimate parties that the bushes give every month or so he 
said they invite about 30 people over for a light buffet supper 
and a movie theres almost a family feeling with the bushes 
walking around greeting each guest 
those invited represent an eclectic mix of society figures 
corporate executives political insiders bush children old texas 
friends a few media types and an occasional celebrity 
the bush circle seems endlessly expansive there is no bush 
clique it just seems to go on and on said mrs ikard who was 
a guest at bushs recent state dinner for venezuelan president 
carlos andres perez 
mrs ikard recalls past presidents who shunned outsiders 
the carters had their inner circle of georgians the reagans 
had the californians and never invited anyone up to the family 
quarters on the third floor camelot was strictly for the kennedy 
people either you were in or you were out she said 
bush doesnt seem to have an a list of social favorites that 
appear regularly on white house guest lists but his inner circle 
if there is one probably would include such unfamiliar names as 
russell train john e chapoton fred zeder and dean burch 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP900521-0207 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
train is chairman of the world wildlife fund chapoton is a 
washington lawyer and former chief tax official at the reagan 
treasury zeder is chairman of the overseas private investment 
corp burch is director general of intelsat and a former republican 
speechwriter 
bush delights in asking outoftown guests to spend the night at 
the white house if a party is running late he sometimes takes a 
snapshot of them lying on lincolns bed 
among those who have taken toothbrushes and pajamas upstairs in 
the bush white house are kentucky horse breeder will farish 
hollywood producer jerry weintraub and baine kerr executive 
committee chairman of pennzoil 
old bush friend jack steele of houston was so awed during his 
sleepover in the lincoln bedroom that he stayed up gazing at the 
washington monument and writing notes at the desk where lincoln 
signed the emancipation proclamation 
bush also actively courts the friendship of show business 
celebrities recent guests at the white house or camp david have 
included muscleman and actor arnold schwarzenegger and entertainer 
michael jackson 
a devoted fan of country music and the movies bush invited 
jimmy dean and the gatlin brothers to join him as weekend guests 
for a screening of coupe de ville at the presidential retreat 
in the catoctin mountains of western maryland 
the presidents movie fare is as diverse as his choice of 
friends in recent months while scooping up handfuls of popcorn 
from silver bowls he has seen scandal field of dreams 
the hunt for red october the fabulous baker boys naked 
gun and stella as well as oscar winner driving miss 
daisy and nominees glory and my left foot 
bush is no stayathome however 
he likes to dash out of the white house to buy fresh bagels at 
wagshalls a local delicatessen or make an impromptu appearance 
at the kennedy center for some light stage entertainment for their 
45th wedding anniversary on jan 6 the bushes went there to see 
a tuna christmas a smalltown texas comedy 
bush enjoys gathering family and friends for an evening of gusty 
dining at local restaurants including galileos an italian 
restaurant near dupont circle and the bustling rio grande cafe in 
suburban bethesda md which serves texmex specialties 
intimates say the president also favors the peking gourmet inn 
in suburban fairfax county va where bush indulges the taste for 
chinese delicacies that he acquired as chief of the us liaison 
office in beijing in the 1970s 
among his favorite dining companions is vic gold longtime press 
spokesman and speechwriter for republican biggies and coauthor of 
bushs autobiography looking forward gold recently introduced 
bush to i ricchi a swank local tuscan restaurant 
when the bushes moved in says gold they made a rule they 
wouldnt be prisoners of the white house or alter their outgoing 
gregarious style of entertaining 
when its party time around town bush administration bigwigs 
are simply staying away embassy row has been quiet since the days 
when argentinas alejandro orfila and the dashing iranian 
ambassador ardeshir zahedi were the toast of the town 
these cabinet people have been here before and they have 
their own friendships said socialite buffy cafritz people 
like jack kemp and dick cheney are a very hardworking group ill 
tell you theyre always at their desks 
mrs cafritz sees washington scaling down in the 1990s to small 
intimate dinner parties corporate lobbyists are bankrolling the 
big blacktie blowouts that once were the specialty of the citys 
grande dames and fundraising benefits from aids charities to 
opera balls are proliferating 
my mail is half junk mail and half invitations to benefits 
sighed mrs ikard 
when reagan was here everyone was upscale and la glamour 
or pretending to be says craig stoltz editor of dossier 
magazine tip sheet of the social set now people are affecting a 
commitment to issues and causes with a lot of selfcongratulating 
you hear more talk about values than at k mart on a saturday 
afternoon 
mrs mosbachers low profile has been a major disappointment 
says stoltz at the democratic convention everyone said where 
was george now theyre asking where is georgette shes 
apparently absorbing the quieter gentler tone of the bush years 
said hairdresser robin weir georgette finally gave a party 
the other night and her guests had to write a check to a charitable 
cause to go its all social conscience now if you want to come 
to my house youve gotta pay 
virtually unknown among the new power players on the washington 
social scene is the elitist membership of three highly secretive 
allmale social clubs to which bush belongs the bohemian club in 
san francisco and the alfalfa and alibi clubs in washington 
the alibi in fact is so clandestine that its members wont 
even acknowledge that it exists but it is known that all three 
serve primarily to give prominent public figures the chance to shed 
their inhibitions and enjoy eating drinking and swapping funny 
stories without fear of disclosure 
in a recent column for washingtonian magazine diana mclellan 
wrote that the most precisely calibrated gauge of status in the 
city is the seating at opening nights at the national theater 
if thats true then alma viator must be the ultimate authority 
on the ins and outs of bushs washington as the theaters public 
relations director she makes seating decisions for opening night 
ms viator who also is a freelance consultant on throwing 
successful washington parties says nobody beats the president of 
course as the prize catch of the evening ditto for secretary of 
state james a baker or secretary mosbacher if bush sends regrets 
and dont forget house speaker tom foley 
other names high on her list include katharine graham chairman 
of the washington post co pat kluge estranged wife of broadcast 
baron john kluge media heavyweights like ted koppel or roger mudd 
and headlinemaking diplomats like soviet ambassador yuri dubinin 
she tries to nab sort of sexy senators like john kerry of 
massachusetts alan simpson of wyoming or bill bradley of new 
jersey plus anyone whos ever run for president even if he lost 
throw in a couple of movie stars for excitement she says for 
added spice include some people whove gotten into a little 
trouble like former reagan white house aides michael j deaver 
or robert mcfarlane 
other big names include public relations honcho robert gray 
playwright larry l king actress lynda carter and the enduring 
buffy cafritz and then theres former house speaker thomas p 
oneill whos still a huge draw at a washington party even 
though he spends his retirement popping out of suitcases on tv 
commercials 
tip has no power nothing said ms viator but he has 
such a great personality hes still very much loved

regulars at the peking gourmet 
inn know that when secret service agents suddenly swarm through the 
front door president bush is returning for another feast at his 
favorite chinese restaurant 
bush in fact might be called a regular himself general 
manager robert tsui says bush has visited the peking gourmet inn 
about 15 times since his first visit on sept 2 1985 when he was 
vice president and a guest of his son marvin 
the next day bush sat down at a typewriter and tapped out a 
glowing testimonial letter to owner eddie tsui roberts father 
that other restaurateurs would kill for 
i just wanted you to know that the food was excellent 
bush wrote your family swung into action and provided terrific 
hospitality and delicious food the duck especially was 
fantastic 
the letter is framed and hangs on a wall surrounded by 
autographed photos of bush sometimes wearing a blue sports shirt 
enjoying the restaurants northern chinese cuisine with his wife 
barbara and their guests who have included attorney general dick 
thornburgh and british ambassador sir antony acland 
bush learned about chinese food while serving as chief us 
liaison officer in beijing in 197475 before diplomatic relations 
between the two countries were restored robert tsui says the 
presidents tastes are wellinformed 
on one visit bush held a detailed 20minute discussion with 
roberts younger brother executive chef george tsui about the 
ingredients of various dishes on the menu i think he knows 
chinese food very well robert tsui said 
the tsui family says bushs visits every few months are relaxed 
casual affairs with friends and family that seem to be arranged on 
the spur of the moment 
instead of spending months arranging it mr bush calls 
personally in the afternoon and says hes coming that evening 
said robert tsui boom its done he takes everyone by surprise 
even some of his guests 
its only a 15minute drive from the white house south across 
the potomac river to the peking gourmet inn situated in one of the 
older neighborhood shopping centers in suburban fairfax county va 
bush usually leaves the choice of dishes to george tsui who is 
familiar with the presidents likes and dislikes we have known 
for a long time that no broccoli is to be served robert tsui 
said 
george keeps the secret service out of his large kitchen it 
makes the chefs nervous he says and he helps longtime waiter 
tak chung pang carry each course from the kitchen to the 
presidential partys large round table behind a plush red partition 
in the dining room 
tsui says bushs favorite is szechuan beef proper a sweet and 
spicy shredded beef served with roasted sesame seeds 
he says the president also is fond of the peking duck a house 
specialty and the four seasons string beans szechuan style a 
blend of string beans and tiny morsels of pork seasoned with ginger 
and garlic and cooked in chicken stock 
the president usually pays the bill by writing a personal check 
but occasionally autographs the bill and promises to mail payment 
you know where to send the bill bush once told his hosts 
the tsui children built the restaurant in 1978 as a retirement 
gift for their father eddie now 77 a native of shandong province 
in china who emigrated to the united states 14 years ago after 
running a couple of restaurants in hong kong 
much of the fresh foods used in the peking gourmet inns kitchen 
are grown on the tsui familys 133acre farm near rural 
purcellville va 40 miles to the west their homegrown produce 
includes giant spring onions chinese chives or leeks peppers 
celery eggplant garlic and garlic sprouts a delicacy cultivated 
in underground caves

take actress dana delany put her in an olive

behind the scenes miss delanys china beach is written 
produced and directed by a staff anchored by women yet to stay on 
the air abcs vietnamthemed series must attract male viewers 
riveted both by the rigors of war and by sweaty comely nurses 
does this indicate men still rule the roost and the bucks 
behind the cameras of videoland 
more women than ever before are making key creative decisions in 
television four of china beachs six writers last season were

producer of the arsenio hall show is marla kell brown 
but while women move up televisions ladder trying to influence 
program content as they climb they still find they work for males 
in a medium playing to male tastes 
youll still find a majority of shows are not only maledriven 
behind the screen but also maledriven on the screen said 
georgia jeffries the supervising producer of china beach 
according to recent studies and interviews women are paid far 
less as much as 50 percent than men in comparable jobs within the 
industry and several television series have excluded women 
completely from their writing staffs 
a 1989 survey by the writers guild of america reported that 
women writers earned 63 cents for every dollar earned by white 
males thats an improvement for men in 1982 women made 73 cents 
for every dollar drawn by white males 
the survey of the 198687 television season found more than a 
dozen shows employing no female writers the programs included 
murder she wrote falcon crest amen and 21 jump 
street almost a third of all network series had little or no 
representation by female writers concluded the report 
the study also found that women writers were twice as likely to 
be hired for sitcoms than actionadventure series 
im sure that if i walked into an office tomorrow with an 
actionadventure movie there might be some resistance because 
im a woman said diane english the emmywinning creator and 
coexecutive producer of the cbs comedy murphy brown 
english and kell brown said too that male executives may 
assume women producers dont have the guts to do the job 
the stereotype is young pliable and not being able to stand 
up to the pressure or supervise men said kell brown 
the networks entertainment divisions all are headed by men 
abcs robert iger cbs jeff sagansky and nbcs brandon tartikoff 
although nobodys accusing the troika of overt male chauvinism 
some women in the business believe the networks continue to 
resemble a frat house grown up 
i do think theres a mens club said susan baerwald the 
executive producer of nbc productions whose credits include fatal 
vision the murder of mary phagan and the executioners 
song 
i do think that the networks are largely male baerwald 
said the people who make the decisions about programming are 
largely male and i think thats a mistake 
has progress been made in the last few years yes has 
discrimination been eliminated hardly

people have the illusion if they see more visible women 
working in certain positions that in fact the industry has made 
great strides said jeffries a former story editor on cbs 
cagney amp lacey 
i think there are strides being made but i think relatively 
they are being made slowly there are a lot of women vice 
presidents who have the power to say no but no power to say yes 
the power structure in this town is still occupied by men 
before some women even walk into a producers office to pitch a 
screenplay or a series they must show that they deserve to be 
there regardless of whether their idea is good 
i was one of the first women in television said susan 
harris who created the shows soap the golden girls and 
empty nest 
i think initially i had to prove that i was a good writer to 
be taken seriously i dont think i was taken seriously until they 
saw the writing and then they began to treat me like a writer 
harris said that sexist skepticism she said is societal 
ive caught myself saying id rather have a man do surgery 
on me than a woman and you really have to stop and think about 
that one its my generation its built in men were capable 
women made the pot roast 
said baerwald when i finished school i was a glorified 
secretary for many years now our options are much more open 
baerwald said as an inhouse nbc executive her paychecks were 
half that of some male colleagues of equal standing 
once a woman has established herself in the television business 
life isnt necessarily easier there are some people several 
prominent women executives say who still assume an ascending woman 
either must be sleeping with or related to someone higher up 
the reverse supposition is rarely if ever made about men 
if a woman is successful there must be another reason why 
shes successful as opposed to her work tenacity and dare we 
even say talent jeffries said 
in the end of course a good writer is a good writer and a good 
producer is a good producer the ostensibly malethemed hockey 
movie slap shot was written by a woman nancy dowd harris is 
writing a feature film about male bonding the cosby show 
roseanne a different world and grand were all 
cocreated by marcy carsey with tom werner of the carseywerner co 
carsey declined to be interviewed saying the focus should be on 
successful producers regardless of sex 
english could put a show on any network next week if she wanted 
few people would do better producing the arsenio hall show 
than kell brown besides taking the show near the top of the 
latenight charts in just a year kell brown brings to the show an 
indispensable point of view shes white female and suburban hes 
not 
arsenio and i come from as different backgrounds as 
possible she said i come from a very white sheltered 
environment i grew up in the brady bunch hell do a sports 
joke and ill say i dont know who that guy is in that way we 
complement each other very well 
said jeffries the essential issue of course is talent and 
productivity can the person hired deliver in a qualitative and 
quantitative manner and i believe there are women out there who do 
it and do a very good job indeed 
since television influences the nations attitudes its likely 
the increased presence of women backstage will give viewers a fresh 
point of view 
i think murphy in a way paved the way for a different kind 
of woman english said normally you see the wife the 
girlfriend or the two roommates 
browns character is not married has no boyfriend and is a 
recovering alcoholic so there was a lot of fear that this woman 
wouldnt be accessible and likable the show is now a hit 
and how does jeffries feel about helping make miss delany a sex 
object she smiled for a moment and said with a laugh i think 
dana delany looks wonderful in a tshirt

most producers make television shows to win 
rating points marian rees aims to win hearts and minds 
rees productions include 1985s love is never silent the 
emmywinning story of deaf parents and their hearing daughter and 
this years a sons promise the wellreceived account of a 
young mans pledge to raise his orphaned brothers 
throughout her career rees has fought to deliver programs that 
have often run contrary to televisions lowest commondenominator 
formulas for her efforts she is now considered one of the most 
successful and acclaimed women in television 
i really quarrel with the assumption that good programming is 
bad business rees said in an interview people are turning 
away from the networks not because its bad business theyre 
turning away because its bad programming 
at marian rees associates inc an independent production 
company rees has formed an alliance with hallmark hall of 
fame collaborations with the greeting card company have yielded 
the marva collins story the room upstairs resting 
place love is never silent foxfire home fires 
burning and the shell seekers 
the company also has production deals with all three networks 
as well as pbs and cables home box office and tnt since the 
company was established in 1981 marian rees associates has made 13 
movies for television and has nine movies in various stages of 
development 
a volunteer for the center for population options and 
alternative living for the aging rees said her work reflects 
several concerns 
my own personal goals and the reason i started the company 
was to be able to do the things i had a strong strong commitment 
to she said most of our works try to have a spin to them on 
an issue and ive also begun to realize that they all turn around 
family 
she studied sociology psychology and religion at the university 
of iowa her first job in television was as an nbc receptionist 
rees served as the associate producer on the pilots of two of 
televisions angel dusted with jean stapleton 
rees knows television still has a lot of room for improvement 
childrens programming is one of the shames of our industry 
she said the whole issue of selling through childrens 
programming is abhorrent 
rees said a recent television movie about the laker girls was 
outright exploitation and she was glad the show fared poorly 
in the ratings 
rees is the president of women in film an organization whose 
future she hopes is not long 
until there is the evidence of equal opportunity and equal 
pay then our hope is that there will be no need for women in film 
at all she said the day we celebrate its dissolution is a day 
we look forward to

editors note might as well be on a train snorts air pioneer 
jepp jeppesen of the jet age he recalls the days when you flew by 
the seat of your pants and when the compass failed checked the 
outhouses they always faced south 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in 1927 elrey jepp jeppesen borrowed 500 
bought an old army surplus jn4 jenny biplane quit high school 
and went barnstorming with a flying circus 
within two years he had flown the first aerial surveys of then 
uncharted mexico he went on to survive dangerous night mail routes 
over the rockies and northwest and he later became an airline 
captain into the 1950s 
but it was his air navigation charts that won him both a fortune 
and a place in the national aviation hall of fame 
jack leffler who founded the museum of flight at seattle once 
said the museum traces the history of flight from leonardo da 
vinci to eb jeppesen jepps work has saved a lot of lives 
people who didnt use his charts ran into mountains 
now 83 jeppesen the shy son of danish immigrants looks back 
on that golden age of aviation from his home in an exclusive cherry 
hills estate area 
it was magical for me i cant hardly believe it ever 
existed he said those old open airplanes you felt like a 
bird a part of the airplane it was so damn much fun you could 
feel the wind on your face the wind on the stick and the rudder 
you were part of it today you just might as well get on a train 
a strong sense of survival prompted jeppesens first chart book 
a tiny handsize looseleaf ring binder 
my motivation was to learn the routes real fast to try to 
remember all these things he said of his days as a night mail 
pilot i started writing them down and making sketches we 
followed railroad tracks called hugging the up or union pacific 
and highways we needed to know the size of the fields where they 
were obstructions such as smokestacks water towers power lines 
trees mountains 
all of the outhouses faced south if your compass went out and 
you could find an outhouse you could find out what direction you 
were going 
jeppesens little black notebook became the granddaddy of the 
jeppesen airway manual first published in 1933 it sold for 10 and 
included landing approach procedures for 50 airfields between 
chicago and oakland calif 
jeppesen confirmed his information by driving the entire 
distance by car climbing mountains and smokestacks and water 
towers with altimeters strapped on his back he obtained additional 
information from city and county engineers surveyors and farmers 
today jeppesen airway manuals are used by all us airlines 
many foreign carriers and twothirds of all instrumentrated pilots 
when instrument flying was introduced during the mid1930s 
jeppesen updated his black book to show pilots how to follow radio 
beacons mileage reference charts and terrain elevation profiles 
i believed instrument flying was the only way we were going to 
be able to develop aviation into a reliable form of 
transportation he said 
at the outbreak of world war ii i had the whole united states 
covered i gave 50 of the manuals to the military and secured 
contracts with both the navy and army air arms he said 
his aviation navigation chart business began as a moonlighting 
business with the help of his wife nadine a united airline 
stewardess he met and married in 1936 they worked from their 
basement in homes in cheyenne salt lake and denver as united moved 
jeppesen about during his commercial pilot career college students 
were hired as draftsmen and artists 
finally in 1954 in denver the stress of two fulltime jobs 
became too much under doctors orders jeppesen retired from 
commercial flying at the age of 47 
when he sold his denverbased air navigation chart company in 
1961 it was grossing 5 million a year and had more than 200 
employees today it employs 840 staff worldwide and grosses 80 
million annually 
jeppesen launched his long aviation career as a teenager 
i never finished high school i soloed with just two hours 
and 15 minutes flying time and bought this jenny for 500 
borrowed most of it from people on my paper route in odell ore 
i got in the airplane and just never got out of it 
id been sleeping in the hangar gassing engines going 
barnstorming with the older guys doing a little wingwalking he 
recalled

i used to take this old jenny up to about 5000 feet over the 
columbia river and make long slow loops all the way down 
the hum of the engine had a lot to do with it the noise of 
the propeller it all glued together for a sensation you certainly 
cant enjoy today on an airliner jeppesen said 
i used the jenny for barnstorming they called it a flying 
circus two or three of us would get our planes and go into a town 
do some stunts to attract the people then charge them 1020 
for a 15minute ride 
in 1929 he landed a job with royal dutch shell oil flying 
english aerial photographer sidney bonnick on a pictorial survey of 
thenuncharted mexico 
he was the 27th pilot to be licensed in oregon the 31st in 
mexico and his federation aeronautique international pilot license 
is no7034 dated jan 29 1929 and signed by orville wright 
in 1930 he began flying the night mail it paid twice as much 
as flying by day for varney airlines at portland and then joined 
boeing air transport both companies later merged to become united 
airlines the carrier jeppesen flew for until 1954 
on the mail runs in wyoming he remembers the wind so strong 
against the puny power of the plane that sometimes hed be flying 
backwards 
flying the mail early in the 1930s was flying by the seat of 
your pants said jeppesen 
we guided mostly on terrain features and dead reckoning we 
flew anywhere from 50 to 300 feet above the ground he said 
i had to start learning fast anytime somebody got sick or 
killed theyd say send jepp over there hes only got a suitcase 
and no family i got to fly a lot of runs that way 
four of the 18 pilots on the oakland calif to cheyenne run 
were killed in the winter of 1930 
flying the night mail in a cold open cockpit with ice on the 
wings you just staggered along the prop would throw ice off and 
it would crash against the fuselage like a rifle bullet the ice 
would get on the wing wires and vibrate and snap like a gun shot 
the most fun was barnstorming he says 
his bright blue eyes look far away as that era seems to fly past 
his mind in review 
god id love to do it all again

editors note nowhere do celebrity stars shine brighter than 
along the heavenly california beach named malibu but tuesday they 
will pause in their orbits to vote about such earthly matters as 
secession and sewage 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
latvia lithuania and estonia yearn for 
independence from the soviet union staten island wants to secede 
from new york city not all that long ago new york city wanted to 
secede from new york state 
so far nothing in politics there is no such thing as nofault 
divorce 
but tuesday the 20000 residents of this spangled coastal 
community everyone from andrews julie to zimbalist efrem 
put their local political future on the line about half of them 
those who are eligible to go to the polls can declare their desire 
to secede from los angeles county and become a city in charge of 
its own future 
similar independence movements have become a wavelet along the 
golden strand from la to san diego 
its been a 26year offandon battle cityhood supporters 
thwarted over and over again from gaining selfdetermination 
for over two years the county board of supervisors has 
repeatedly blocked the way to the polls this year superior court 
judge dzintra janavs ordered them to stand aside 
the county wanted to delay the vote a year pleading bureacratic 
adjustments when that was taken to the same superior court judge 
the county removed her and installed a new judge but alas that 
judge ruled the year delay unnecessary 
in malibu they were wearing tshirts that asked whats the 
difference between malibu and the united states in the united 
states you can vote 
cityhood seems to have a real chance at last 
it inspired president george bush in a beverly hills speech to 
say 
people from panama to prague are striving for democracy 
selfdetermination is contagious they even want it in malibu i 
understand leaping over volleyball nets to freedom 
which brings in a third player in the freedom game 
pepperdine university high on a splendiferous hill overlooking 
the pacific and known on national television for fielding 
extravagantly talented volleyball teams has already gone to other 
state authorities for permission to be captain of its fate master 
of its sewage 
sewage believe it or not is the key word 
like the grand canyon malibu must be seen to be appreciated it 
stretches 26 miles along the charmed california coast north of 
santa monica and the pacific palisades both evidence of what 
unencumbered development can do where houses were built on eroding 
sand bluffs in an effort to catch the ocean view 
burning red sunsets over the pacific the high light catching 
the mountains become so commonplace to residents they barely take 
notice they do notice that on a clear day they can see santa 
catalina island 23 miles out 
in their book backroom politics authors bill and nancy 
boyarsky wrote of the long sewer battle 
one of the few communities that has learned to understand this 
obscure political game is malibu in southern california where the 
santa monica mountains reach the sea there the canyons widen into 
coastal plain and then become part of the beaches 
malibu is almost 30 miles from downtown los angeles and even 
today it still has a bit of a rural look but only a little just 
a few feet separate houses on the beach and during rush hour and 
on weekends the pacific coast highway which runs through malibu 
is a noisy smelly tangle of recreational vans sports cars camper 
trucks and sedans 
the desire to develop malibu has not diminished there is 
still vacant land and the only thing stopping a building boom 
along the beach and back into the mountains is the lack of sewers

<TEXT>
that was written 16 years ago and nothing has changed save a 
few more businesses including a new hotel on the ocean side of 
the highway the beach has been developed but empty spaces stretch 
inland 
on the other side of the mountains is the san fernando valley 
where sewers preceded unprecedented home building a constant 
reminder of what can happen 
pepperdine in the middle of what would become the city of 
malibu got itself declared exempt from the proposed municipality 
the university does not want anyone else determining its future 
plans nor does the wouldbe city want pepperdine governing its 
future 
this is a town with a university says joan house one 
candidate for city council not a university town 
early cityhood failures in 1964 and 1976 could be blamed on the 
fear of higher taxes 
but at the same time the same voters voted down bond issues that 
would have built extensive sewers which meant more homes more 
people 
the vote for cityhood was meant to be a vote to answer the 
question once and for all but no knowledgeable malibuans point 
out that the ballot also has five slots for the first city council 
there are so many candidates against development and so few on the 
other side that a unified anticity prodevelopment minority could 
easily win the council over a splintered majority 
a mayor would be elected from a new city council currently 
actor martin sheen is honorary mayor 
perhaps because of its celebrity community perhaps for its 
laidback nature malibu like other suburbs of the movie industry 
gets no respect after his comments on freedom for malibu 
president bush in another speech commented on community support 
groups springing up around the country in malibu he said a new 
crisis support group was called mothers for perrier 
but a large proportion of malibus population are retired 
teachers and engineers and the like who were lucky or farsighted 
enough to buy into the beach 20 or more years ago when it was 
relatively cheap homes that once sold for 20000 now sell for 
750000 and homes that sold for 150000 now sell for over 2 
million 
homes for most malibuans are their whole wealth and they have 
defended them against storms that have washed their neighbors out 
and fires that have raged down from the hills and landslides that 
have left them isolated as surely as if they were living on an 
island 
there are certain constants weekend traffic chokes the pacific 
coast highway so badly residents dont even venture out to the 
movies the rule is a loaf of bread a jug of wine and leave the 
bmw in the driveway 
local politics however are never skindeep malibu on the 
sands seems to have feet of clay 
cozy almost like an extended family malibu is learning some 
harsh lessons about ego and monied interests cityhood supporters 
say developers have already sunk millions into vacant malibu land 
counting on sewers and more building but some residents are 
alarmed at what they consider the crass behavior of some cityhood 
supporters who would pillory old and respected residents who dont 
believe in their cause 
it will all be settled june 5 or will it 
theres blood in the streets says one resident come june 
6 nobodys going to be talking to anybody else

cadillac man orion rated r 
 
robin williams may well be in agreement with the los angeles 
lakers on the proposition that you cant win them all 
coming off academy award nominations for good morning 
vietnam and dead poets society it appeared the hyper comic 
could do no wrong alas he throws a piston with cadillac man 
williams is far too inventive a performer to fail completely 
but his protean talents are straitjacketed as joey obrien a 
charmless sexcrazy car salesman whose redemption comes too late 
cadillac man begins promisingly under the titles a 
helicopter shot focuses on the new york skyline then across an 
endless landscape of gravestones on the edge of the cemetery a 
funeral procession is stalled by a disabled hearse 
enter joey who sells cars with the zeal of michael milken 
peddling junk bonds he befriends the mortician and presents a 
card when he tries the same with the widow elaine stritch in a 
funny bit she calls him a sleaze 
thats what he is all right joey will say anything to sell a 
car meanwhile he tries to service two mistresses one a married 
woman fran drescher the other a ditsy wouldbe designer 
annabella sciorra placate his exwife pamela reed and stay 
out of the clutches of a debtcollecting mafia boss bill nelson 
joey also faces an impossible sales quota or hes fired 
the tedium of joeys travails ends with a crash tim robbins 
smashes the showroom door with his cycle he brandishes an 
automatic weapon madly seeking the lover of his wife who works at 
the agency 
are hostage situations a likely source of comedy after watching 
the nightly news you might not think so williams and robbins 
strive mightily to make it work and almost succeed the rangy 
wildeyed robbins impressive as the feckless minor leaguer in 
bull durham somehow ingratiates as the reluctant terrorist 
the two stars and the large supporting cast get little help from 
ken friedmans lusterless script or from roger donaldsons 
haphazard direction the filmmakers seem to believe that loud is 
funny it aint

fire birds touchstone pictures rated pg13 
 
a sure sign that a movie is doomed from the start is when it 
opens with a printed quote from president bushs september 1989 
socalled war on colombian drug lords and the screening 
audience giggles 
fire birds tumbles to the very depths of lousy filmmaking on 
that note 
with a stilted screenplay by nick thiel and paul f edwards 
story by step tyner john k swenson and dale dye that never 
quite figures out if its a silly love story or a contrived 
adventure fire birds just might be a poor attempt at hollywood 
patriotism 
jake preston nicolas cage and billie lee guthrie sean young 
are part of an elite army helicopter corps being trained for a 
secret invasion in south america their expert mentor is brad 
little tommy lee jones 
training is partly through computerized simulators which make 
video games look wimpy and actual flight maneuvers the shots 
whether computerized or real are breathtaking and provide the 
only real excitement in the movie 
jake in muhammad ali bravura reminds anyone wholl listen that 
hes the greatest and next to little he is guthrie will 
remind anyone wholl listen that shes no longer romantically 
interested in jake who stalks her like a greedy ivory poacher 
love in this movie unfortunately does not take a back seat to 
the mission which is to be a strike against a mercenary named 
stoller bert rhine who is an ace with fighter helicopters we 
know stoller is the evil bad guy because the honchos sitting around 
the pentagon conference table tell us so and in a slide 
presentation of stoller helping drug dealers load their stuff for 
transport the pentagon biggies show us a closeup of stollers 
eyes bert rhine must have spent hours staring in a mirror to get 
just the right menace to his brow 
but there is no clearcut enemy in fire birds its hard to 
cheer on the boys when we havent seen the bad guys do anything 
bad that part of the story isnt developed the filmmakers merely 
slap a tag on a few people and were to accept it it just doesnt 
wash and makes the mission more of a cartoon than anything else 
what also works against the movie is the romance subplot it 
slows the pacing and provides nothing in terms of moving the plot 
or providing a needed dynamic cage with his basset hound 
droopiness and crass manners and the anorexiclooking young are 
possibly two of the most unappealing actors in the business both 
are difficult to watch whether alone or together there is no 
electricity between the two and their heated moments give off a 
chill definitely bad casting by mike fenton and judy taylor 
jones however is a blessed relief with his rapidfire 
presentation and middleage vulnerabilities hes mr military all 
the way he even tells his longsuffering wife at one point that he 
could have made her a millionaire if he had peddled his talents in 
the private sector but serving his country was more important he 
says 
david green has spent most of his years as a filmmaker directing 
and producing television dramas and documentaries including boy 
in the bubble that smallscreen experience shows in fire 
birds because there is a limited vision and sweep richard t 
stevens as secondunit director does much better with the action 
shots and stan mcclains aerial photography is stellar 
the production notes say producers keith barish and arnold 
kopelson wanted to do for the army what top gun did for the 
navy they should be courtmartialed

sea of love mca home entertainment vhsbeta no suggested 
retail price rated r 
 
sea of love might better be called ocean of despair or 
tide of terror with its dual themes of lonely hearts and 
vicious murders 
director harold becker has crafted a taut suspense based on a 
series of murders that have one thing in common all the victims 
had placed ads in a singles column of a new york magazine 
in grisly fashion the killer has the men lay naked face down on 
a bed and pretend to make love before shooting them in the back of 
the head 
two homicide detectives al pacino and john goodman set out to 
find the killer by placing an ad of their own believing the 
murderer a woman will respond and fal into their trap 
enter ellen barkin mysterious leggy and too alluring for 
pacinos own good as one of the ads respondents she becomes a 
suspect as easily as she becomes pacinos lover 
barkin perfectly plays the role its impossible to tell if 
shes a cunning killer or guarded sad heart hurt once too often in 
the dating danger zone and that quirky smile of hers one side 
sloping downward adds a hint of melancholy to even the lightest 
moments 
pacino who makes his return to film after a fouryear 
selfimposed absence is perfect as a paunchy divorced alcoholic 
his puffy glassy eyes seem to have seen too many dead bodies and 
too many bars at closing time 
the movie gets its gritty realism from the dialogue written by 
richard price who befriended new york cops to get little nuggets 
such as calling a victim a facedown taxpayer and calling the 
suspect a doer and a shooter 
if there is a flaw in this film its the pat ending that seems 
to put on a forced happy face perhaps hollywood executives demand 
audiences be given a warm fuzzy finish but viewers will find this 
one ingratiating and disappointing

king blank to beggars banquet the ian lowery group 
 
restless singer ian lowerys career has taken him from the wall 
to ski patrol folk devils and a solo career as king blank thats 
four bands no hits 
now king blank has been renamed the ian lowery group for its 
second album king blank to the uninitiated will need to hear 
it just once to understand how fame has eluded lowery 
commercial hes not lowerys music can be described as 
neopunk dueling guitars recall television jarring chord 
progressions are reminiscent of richard hell and nihilistic singing 
suggests johnny rotten i need nobody or anything can you 
imagine lowery snarls in need 
the mixture results in a sound thats original and hard to 
dismiss theres a kind of recklessness to rockers such as never 
trust me and youre gonna pay that is bracing the energy 
flags only on the albums slowest songs wild times and the 
party 
best of all are lowerys lyrics he comes across like lou reed 
after an especially bad day at the office dark descriptions of 
life on the fringe shed new light on such subjects as betrayal 
revenge sex drugs and murder 
the standout cut is jack dust a banjodriven folk song with 
a violent storyline a sense of humor and several neat plot twists 
there ought to be a market for work this good

peter and the wolf op 67 by sergei prokofiev the carnival of 
the animals emi philharmonia orchestra efrem kurtz conductor 
jonathan winters narrator 
 
welcome to the jonathan winters show the comedians name looms 
larger than the titles of the works on the booklet and his 
breathless bio comes first he also dominates this disc in just 
about every other way usually not to its advantage 
first his voice and the orchestra sound like they are in 
differemt rooms with the orchestra in the back of the house and 
winters close up in fact they sound separately recorded the 
orchestra meanwhile has a dull lifeless quality and the 
playing particularly in peter and the wolf is indifferent 
winters when reading the text lets a bored note creep into his 
voice he also frequently adds his own comments and imitations of 
the characters which generally dont equal what the music can do 
he follows with little asides identifying what hes imitating 
younger children might be disturbed to hear winters comment that 
the cat sounds like shed been run over by a car 
saintsaens musical bestiary comes off better winters sticks 
to the text and shows his brilliance as a mimic by using different 
accents for the charming and witty ogden nash verse that introduces 
each section ray clarks cello solo in the swan is longnecked 
and eloquent

charlton heston doesnt think he got the part 
of moses all by himself in cecil b demilles epic the ten 
commandments 
i think michaelangelo got me the part he says 
the 1956 classic is back in the news as part of its film 
preservation program paramount pictures has restored prints in 
70mm with sixtrack stereo sound the ten commandments was 
shown at two los angeles theaters on may 1624 with engagements to 
follow across the country 
at his coldwater canyon home heston recalled his dealings with 
demille the ultimate autocrat of the movie set 
demilles casting method was very curious said the actor 
who had starred for the director in the greatest show on earth 
you never got to read the script nobody did he would tell 
you the story of the film from the point of view of your character 
he would tell you the various scenes and he already had designs 
for the props and sets and costumes he would show you all these 
things but he never would say i am considering you for this 
part 
so you couldnt say id really like to play that part and 
it would be marvelous to have it all you could say was it 
certainly sounds like its going to be a marvelous picture mr 
demille 
then two or three months later he would call you in and it 
would be essentially the same thing though he had more things to 
show you finally he made a choice but you were never engaged in 
a dialogue on that score heston said 
i think the thing he could never get out of his mind was that 
early in the casting process someone pointed out that 
michaelangelos statue of moses looked very much like me it really 
does the broken nose is the same the cheekbones the long jaw 
the forehead the deepset eyes and all that 
paramounts restoration and rerelease of its classics the 
first was funny face drew applause from heston long involved 
with the american film institute he has been vitally interested in 
preservation the most important thing the afi does 
if restoration doesnt take place then the film is gone 
he said that would be tragic because film has been described 
not only as the art form of the 20th century but the american art 
form 
paramount is taking a significant lead in the archival 
process behind what used to be the paramount tank with the big sky 
cyclorama a curved screen used as background for stage settings 
in back where many of the scenes for the ten commandments were 
shot the studio is building an archival facility it will be used 
to store films under controlled conditions of climate and 
humidity 
illinoisborn charlton heston was a 27yearold actor from 
broadway and television when he arrived in hollywood for a 
fivepicture contract with hal wallis his first movie was dark 
city his second film was the greatest show on earth which 
he says brought his best notice ever 
demille showed him a letter from a moviegoer who complimented 
james stewart betty hutton gloria grahame cornel wilde and the 
rest of the cast adding i thought the circus manager did very 
well in there with the real actors 
heston appeared in a few more films until demille summoned him 
once more moses was an immense role for an actor barely in his 30s 
i think in all there were nine different makeups said 
heston not counting the baby which my son fraser played at 
the age of 3 months i went from the young prince moses to the aged 
patriarch the whitehaired longbearded moses who watches his 
people cross over jordan and he goes up the mountain not to 
immortality because he wasnt divine but he disappears from the 
ken of man 
what was it like working for demille 
he was very demanding and mind you i only worked for him in 
his last two pictures if he was a martinet in his early days that 
had mellowed a bit he was relentlessly demanding so was willy 
wyler so was george stevens 
he was extraordinarily courteous with the actors he had quite 
a formal manner he still came to work in a suit and a tie on 
location the same suit with britches and puttees for rough country 
he didnt shoot a lot of closeups in those days they didnt 
look at casablanca and there are three closeups in the entire 
film two of bergman and one of bogart the proliferation of 
closeups has increased as the film definition and color gradation 
has improved 
heston added that demille often used assistant directors and 
prop men as whipping boys but was always courteous to extras 
addressing them as ladies and gentlemen 
chuck heston at 67 has weathered the years well hes never 
dodged a controversy such as his battles with the liberal ed 
asner over screen actors guild politics ads for the national rifle 
association and his support of president bush and other republicans 
and hes kept his hand in the profession he recently starred in 
treasure island written and directed by fraser and released on 
the tnt network heston reported proudly that the movie was picked 
up by warner bros for theatrical distribution 
another new film is solar crisis a sciencefiction tale for 
release this summer he has produced his second book reporting on 
his experience in directing the caine mutiny court martial in 
china most recently he was promoted to god playing the diety in 
paul hogans new film almost an angel

in his vintage zoot suit twotone wingtipped 
shoes and fashionably tipped straw hat august darnell is the very 
picture of cool 
the frontman for kid creole and the coconuts will tell you that 
himself smiling playfully making words sound as neatly pleated as 
a wellpressed pair of slacks we dont want drugs and aids no to the 
people of the well 
of the egg 
ramon de la mata urban policy consultant to the government of 
the autonomous region of madrid which commissioned the project 
recently talked about the 71yearold saenzs de oizas perspective 
in an interview 
confronted with an aggressive environment the adjacent 
trafficclogged m30 beltway and surrounding faceless apartment 
blocks oiza builds a wall around his houses saying i dont 
like this city lets turn this building in on itself 
pozo del huevo is one of numerous shantytowns built in the 1950s 
on the outskirts of madrid by rural immigrants drawn to the city by 
an industrial boom land speculation and inadequate provisions for 
public dwellings condemned them and their children to substandard 
housing in areas that have become breeding grounds for delinquency 
and drug trafficking 
oizas rejection of the urban environment through his walled 
city is felt as a snub to the residents of the prosperous adjacent 
la estrella neighborhood and the surrounding area of moratalaz 
where prices for threebedroom apartments have almost doubled since 
1987 
their damaged pride surfaced as raw fury when they learned it 
would be the inhabitants of the pozo del huevo shantytown in 
their eyes all gypsies drug addicts and carriers of switchblade 
knives who would be moving into the project 
a lot of people talk about preventive medicine these days 
said local resident and hospital employee juan domingo well 
what we want to do is prevent a crime wave around here 
as madrids sensationalist press fueled the fires with such 
headlines as the human cage and prison for the poor 
residents of la estrella and moratalaz cut traffic on the m30 
every thursday afternoon demanding that the pozo del huevo people 
be housed elsewhere and the saenz de oiza apartments be sold to 
people such as themselves 
some 65 percent of the adult males in the pozo del huevo are 
seasonal construction workers and as in most urban areas of spain 
youth umemployment is more than double the 16 percent overall 
national rate 
but heroin addiction and trafficking endemic in most of 
madrids other marginal areas and the accompanying high crime 
levels are negligible 
we drove the dealers out at gunpoint says tomas blazquez 
president of the pozo del huevo neighborhood association 
maria luisa who lives with her husband two children and 
parentsinlaw in one of the damp ramshackle shanties in pozo del 
huevo says there is concealed homelessness in madrid 
nobody dares to build shanty houses anymore twenty years ago 
you got married young and if you didnt have a house you built a 
shanty now young people carry on living with their parents in 
their shanties 
but urban affairs officials say shantybuilding on the fringes 
of madrid however illegal is still very active 
housing relocation head rosa molina says gypsies who live in the 
la veguilla shantytown north of the city are now building shanties 
for moroccans the most recent of the immigrant arrivals and 
renting them for the equivalent of 100 a month 
another housing official miguel angel pascual say this 
shanty speculation is being fueled by the massive influx into 
the madrid area by families attracted by news of government plans 
to build extensive lowcost housing 
when the government council member for urban policy urged that 
the 186 million saenz de oiza project apartments be sold to 
middleclass families to finance other housing for pozo del huevo 
people somewhere else they marched on government headquarters 
demanding respect for the 1985 agreement they also expressed 
resentment that the architect and builders failed to solicit their 
opinion about their new residence 
a day later the madrid regional government renewed its 
commitment to move the people of the egg well from their crumbling 
shanties into the walled city

the coauthor of a book criticizing 
us attitudes and trade policies toward japan said his nation is 
fighting an uphill economic battle against a crazy giant 
the united states could rebound as an industrial power not by 
japanbashing or retaliatory trade policies against his country 
but by reviving the spirit that settled the west shintaro ishihara 
said 
you should help yourselves he said 
ishihara and sony corp chairman akio morita cowrote the 1989 
book the japan that can say no the book was published only in 
japan but translated copies and excerpts have circulated widely in 
this country 
in the book ishihara argues that japan needs to be more 
assertive in standing up to america he brags about japans 
technological superiority and suggests that japan could change the 
military balance of power by selling microchips used to target 
nuclear missiles to the soviet union instead of america 
ishihara also says american criticism of japan is based on 
racism he and morita blame shortsighted management for americas 
declining competitiveness 
ishihara a conservative member of the japanese diet or 
parliament spoke to about 300 people sunday at a public meeting 
organized by us rep sander levin dmich at lawrence 
technological university in this detroit suburb 
all the japanese believe in what i say ishihara said 
through an interpreter at a news conference after the meeting 
sunday detroit is one of the focuses of the usjapan friction 
i have learned much from this town but nothing surprised me 
i dont think i have to change my way of thinking 
washington and tokyo recently negotiated the removal of japanese 
import barriers on trade in satellites supercomputers and wood 
products as a result the bush administration has decided not to 
put japan on this years hit list of countries with unfair 
trading practices under the super 301 provision of the 1988 
trade act 
despite the agreement ishihara said the trade act is a wrong 
law that will only increase trade tensions 
us exercise of the super 301 clause is something like a 
powerful giant wielding a sword a crazy giant hurting 
themselves he said 
ishihara also was harshly critical of bootleg translations of 
the japan that can say no by among others the pentagon and 
levin himself who published portions of it in the congressional 
record 
i used to believe that freedom of speech was guaranteed in the 
united states ishihara said but what has been done to my book 
was a lynch in washington early this month he said he was 
working on publishing an english version 
levin said americans are rightly concerned about what he said 
were the relatively closed markets that have contributed to this 
countrys 50 billion trade deficit with japan but he conceded 
that some of ishiharas criticism of us shortcomings in 
education management and cooperation between government and the 
private sector was justified 
americans feel it just isnt right that what we produce with 
the sweat of our hands and the energies of our minds dont have 
access to japan levin said americans are impatient we dont 
like it 
but you also heard the applause during the public meeting 
when you heard someone say weve got to shape up too he 
said when there was no 50billion trade deficit nobody was 
talking about racism 
levin said he planned to visit japan later this year to meet 
with ishihara and his constituents more facetoface meetings 
could improve usjapan relations now defined mainly by government 
negotiators and the media he said 
we really dont know each other very well he said

the dollar gained against the japanese yen for the 
fourth consecutive trading day today and the yens weakening 
sharply pushed down prices on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 15325 yen up 035 yen from last fridays 
close of 15290 yen after opening at 15338 yen it moved in a 
range of 15320 yen to 15360 yen 
the dollar now has gained 195 yen in the last four trading days 
currency dealers said the dollar gained from a widespread 
anticipation that the decline of us interest rates would stop 
there was no major marketaffecting news other than slowdown 
of the lowering of us interest rates said a dealer with 
daiichi kangyo bank speaking on condition of anonymity but i 
dont expect the dollars upswing to continue much further 
another dealer at the bank of tokyo said the dollar was 
boosted slightly by speculative trading 
traders sought to buy the dollar up to the upper 153 level 
but could not break the barrier at 15360 yen today he said 
in the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which fell 4788 points last friday shed another 24867 
points or 078 percent closing at 3176505 
securities dealers attributed the decline to the yens weakening 
against the dollar and falling bond prices 
the market sentiment is bearish because of the declining 
japanese yen said ichitaro watanabe of nikko securities after 
the nikkei index reached the 32000 mark last thursday investors 
began profittaking causing lower prices 
dealers said construction and food shares were sold while 
pharmaceutical and electronic shares rose moderately

grain and soybean futures prices were moderately 
lower in early trading this morning on the chicago board of trade 
pressured in part by forecasts for drier weather in the midwest and 
southeast 
heavy rain during the past two weeks has slowed corn planting 
and lowered yield prospects for winter wheat but the gradual 
clearing expected this week could allow farmers to get back into 
their fields said victor lespinasse an assistant vice president 
in the graintrading division of dean witter reynolds inc 
further selling stemmed from an agriculture department report 
released late friday that showed lighterthanexpected 
participation by farmers in the 1990 acreage setaside program 
which means farmers may plant more corn than the market had 
anticipated 
analysts linked additional selling to speculation the soviet 
union may reduce its grain imports because the cost of importing 
grain has become a drain on the soviet economy lespinasse said 
in early trading wheat futures prices were 1 cents to 3 cents 
lower with the contract for delivery in may at 382 a bushel corn 
futures were 1 cents to 3 cents lower with may at 282 a bushel 
oats were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with may at 148 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents to 6 cents lower with may at 607 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading 
on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 10 cent lower to 55 cent higher with june at

the number of working us oil and natural gas 
rigs rose for the third straight week increasing by 31 to total 
972 baker hughes inc reported monday 
in the past two weeks the rig count had posted increases of 
three and then 11 previously the count had declined for several 
weeks 
this weeks count also is well ahead of the 737 total posted a 
year ago baker hughes said 
the houstonbased companys rig count is the widely watched 
industry index of drilling activity it reflects the number of 
rotary rigs actively exploring for oil and gas as of last friday 
not the number of producing wells 
hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that merged with baker 
international corp of orange calif has kept track of the rig 
count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oilproducing states california posted the largest 
increase with 16 followed by oklahoma and louisiana which each 
gained nine rigs wyomings count increased by six kansas was up 
by four and pennsylvania and ohio gained one each 
texas lost three rigs colorado was down by two and michigan

focus on highgrowth markets in eastern europe and asia 
the company said its mothers and salerno subsidiaries with 
combined annual revenue of about 200 million hold only 57 
percent of the us biscuit market further expansion would have 
been too costly bsn said

in the past year said new opportunities are opening in eastern 
europe and asia 
the french food group retains us units in other products

motorola inc said monday it it will begin 
universal drug testing of its 60000 us employees this year 
apparently becoming the second major corporation to test all 
workers for substance abuse 
the giant electronics company based in suburban schaumburg has 
been testing job applicants since 1987 said spokeswoman margot 
brown motorola also has had a policy of testing of workers 
involved in accidents or exhibiting dangerous behavior 
under the expanded policy all employees will be tested within 
the next three years ms brown said 
motorola has experienced problems with drug use as have most 
other major corporations she said 
texas instruments inc another electronics manufacturer began 
universal drug testing in november 1989 said spokeswoman sandy 
christopher 
dallasbased texas instruments employs about 52000 people in 
the united states upper management was tested in the fourth 
quarter of 1989 and testing of all employees began jan 2 
theres been a very small percentage of employees whove 
complained about invasion of their privacy but surprisingly 
enough the employees are very supportive of the policy ms 
christopher said 
it gets into safety who wants to be working next to someone 
thats on drugs and to produce quality products its very 
important to have a drugfree workplace she said 
after seeking employee opinions ms brown of motorola said 
what we came up with was that a lot of our employees were 
concerned about a drug problem and felt that if we were going to do 
testing of our employees the only fair way to do it was to test 
all of them 
we feel our approach is balanced motorolans who dont abuse 
drugs will have a safe workplace and those who do abuse drugs will 
be offered help she added 
employees will be tested by urinalysis if that test is 
positive a second a more complex test will be used to check the 
results employees testing positive once will be offered 
confidential counseling and those testing positive twice will be 
dismissed 
neither companys workers are represented by unions 
the institute for a drugfree workplace in washington praised 
motorolas action 
i think its an excellent program and its one we have found 
that employees are increasingly supportive of said mark a de 
bernardo the institutes executive director 
a gallup poll in december showed 60 percent of american workers 
favor drug testing by their employers the percentage fell to 51 
percent when the 1007 workers were asked whether companies should 
be able to test any employee randomly 
the poll also showed 29 percent of the workers surveyed thought 
drug testing invaded privacy and should be done only under limited 
circumstances 
the poll with a 31 percent margin of error was commissioned 
by the institute a coalition of 14 large corporations concerned 
about employer rights in battling drug abuse both motorola and 
texas instruments are institute members 
the american civil liberties union opposes such testing 
because the test will eventually test all employees makes it 
no less an invasion of privacy than a totally random system said 
harvey grossman legal director of the illinois aclu chapter 
and the willingness of a majority of people to abandon their 
privacy rights doesnt in any way invalidate the feelings and the 
integrity of those who believe theyre entitled to their most basic 
and fundamental privacy interests despite someone paying them for 
an honest days work grossman said 
were not opposed to companies taking proper measures to 
ensure that employees performance is not impaired on the job 
particularly in safetyrelated issues said gene guerrero 
legislative representative for the aclus washington office 
but if you as an employer are concerned about safety and 
productivity use an impairment test dont run around telling 
people what they can do on their time off guerrero said

soviet newspapers izvestia and pravda are 
chasing american advertising pegged to the the upcoming summit 
between president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev but 
their ad salesmen are finding its a tough sell 
us companies even those already doing business in the soviet 
union are taking a goslow approach to print advertising for a 
russian audience 
the governmentrun newspaper izvestia disclosed plans in april 
to publish a pair of special supplements on the united states 
during the summit which starts next week the russianlanguage 
supplements would be tucked inside about 2 million copies of the 
newspaper which has a total circulation of 11 million 
while several us companies and ad agencies have expressed 
interest none has bought space yet an official said monday 
american businessmen are perhaps not as aggressive in terms of 
looking at the market possibilities in russia in this way said 
anthony r wight head of publicitas inc in charge of ad sales 
for izvestia 
wight said izvestia has been peddling space to western 
advertisers since january nearly all of the buyers so far have 
been european 
pravda the official newspaper of the soviet communist party 
sent out notices to dozens of american companies last week 
encouraging them to buy fullpage ads during the summit it claims 
circulation of more than 8 million 
only a couple of years ago the very notion of rebirth of the 
stock exchange in russia or direct participation in the soviet 
enterprise amounted to heresy but that is not the case anymore 
pravdas in filipov wrote to american business leaders in asking 
for their advertising support 
the message arrived via facsimile machine at some companies and 
some companies said there were skeptical about the authenticity of 
the offer 
victor linnik a pravda correspondent in new york who is 
overseeing the newspapers ad sales here said the offer was 
genuine and that the first western advertiser in pravda was the 
german airline lufthansa in early may 
the country is moving to a new stage in its economic 
development the world has changed and pravda simply cannot remain 
indifferent to the commercial side of its own business he said 
but linnik said late last week no american companies had signed 
up although there had been some interest expressed 
izvestia is selling a fullpage ad in the supplements for 
42500 for a blackandwhite ad pravda quoted a price of 50000 
for a fullpage ad 
for comparison the wall street journal charges 99385 for a 
fullpage ad in its national edition usa today charges 57232 
during the week for a similar fullpage ad in its paper 
ad agency executives said the lack of an independent auditing 
system for soviet circulation claims makes some companies wary of 
the newspapers 
they add that western companies have only limited access to 
soviet markets many have no presence there at all and some feel 
they can spend their money better on other traderelated activities 
it only makes sense for two reasons you either anticipate 
going into the market or you are already there said allen banks 
media director for saatchi amp saatchi advertising inc in new york 
pepsicola international has bought time on soviet television 
and advertises on soviet billboards and at its soft drink kiosks in 
russia but has made no decision on newspaper advertising 
we are certainly looking at it at this point but we really 
havent come to a decision said anna nerbovig a spokeswoman for 
pepsicola international 
philip morris cos inc sells marlboro cigarettes in russia 
its something we would consider but we dont know yet said 
company spokeswoman posie disesa 
william e cornelius director of trade policy for dow chemical 
co in midland mich said dow has been in business in the soviet 
union for 20 years has a sales office in moscow and recently 
completed a study of the feasibility of setting up a chemical 
manufacturing complex in russia 
but he said his company is basically a supplier of industrial 
products not consumer products and therefore advertising in those 
consumer newspapers would serve no practical purpose for us

151 a bushel 
all contracts for may deliveries of grains and soybeans expired 
at noon monday the may soybean contract went off the board at 
604 a bushel may wheat expired at 383 may corn at 280 and 
may oats at 144 
july soybeans have dropped by 50 cents a bushel since may 10 
when the agriculture department issued a report projecting a 
bountiful 1990 harvest of 19 billion bushels and an increase in 
the us soybean stockpile 
analysts said rising south american soybean exports have 
bolstered perceptions that brazil and argentina can handle current 
global demand and at prices that are generally lower than in the 
us 
weather conditions also have undermined soybean prices the same 
rainy weather that has hampered corn planting in the midwest has 
driven speculation that farmers will switch some of their planned 
corn acres to soybeans since soybeans can be planted later with no 
loss of yield 
mondays forecasts called for relatively little rain this week 
in the midwest 
we should see some acceleration of planting of corn and 
soybeans both said walter spilka a grainmarket analyst with 
smith barney harris upham amp co 
in a weekly report issued after markets closed the usda said 
corn planting was 76 percent finished as of sunday compared with 
the norm of 88 percent for that date soybean planting was 17 
percent done compared with the norm of 43 percent 
analysts linked additional selling across the board to 
speculation the soviet union may reduce its grain imports because 
the cost of importing grain has become a drain on the soviet 
economy 
selling pressure in the wheat market was offset by news that 
china was seeking to buy 400000 metric tons of us wheat at 
subsidized prices 
after the close the usda announced it had targeted algeria for 
sales of 2 million metric tons of wheat and zaire for 100000 
metric tons

stanley s arkin one of the nations bestknown 
trial attorneys and a leading defense lawyer in wall street fraud 
cases has decided to hang his shingle on someone elses door 
the 52yearold courtroom veteran who began his career 
defending accused murderers and drug dealers and later expanded to 
more complex cases ranging from celebrity divorces to stock 
manipulation said monday hes joining chadbourne amp park a 
250lawyer firm based in new york on july 1 
arkins decision to vacate his lonewolf practice after 20 years 
surprised some colleagues in manhattans elite fraternity of 
highpaid lawyers but others called it a reflection of the growing 
power of big multiservice firms that make it increasingly 
difficult for smaller practices to compete 
going back a number of years ago none of the large firms had 
that capability most of that work was referred out said andrew 
lawler a fellow defense attorney who has maintained his own 
practice as more have taken on these matters themselves theres 
fewer referrals 
arkin said the increasingly complicated nature of his work 
required expertise in many fields from tax law to bankruptcy and 
his association with chadbourne will enable me to expand the 
scope of my practice by offering clients the varied legal resources 
of a major law firm 
asked in a telephone interview whether he feared dulling the 
allure of his rogue identity by joining a larger practice he said 
ill be stanley arkin at chadbourne park and be even more 
sellable 
arkin is one of the countrys leading securities fraud and trial 
attorneys whose client list reads like a whos who of celebrities 
both on and off wall street hes also is an aggressive businessman 
who reportedly earns more than 1 million in fees a year and has 
been known to accept noncash compensation ranging from african 
dolls to georgia okeeffe paintings 
stanley is undoubtedly one of the top if not the top 
business getter in the private practice defense bar more than 
that hes a remarkable lawyer said attorney john siffert an 
arkin friend asked why arkin would abandon his lonewolf image 
siffert said a lone wolf sometimes wants to be part of the 
pack 
arkins bestknown claim to fame in recent years has been 
representing wall street professionals implicated in fraud he is 
outspoken in his criticism of what he calls the overzealous 
prosecution of insider trading cases once likening it to 
shooting a blackmarketeer in russia 
his clients have included richard b wigton a kidder peabody amp 
co trader who faced insider trading charges later dropped by 
federal prosecutors salim b lewis a wellknown stock speculator 
convicted on charges of stock manipulation and ronald yagoda head 
trader at marcus schloss amp co acquitted of insider trading in 
what became known as the yuppie five fraud ring 
one of arkins most important clients was a comparative nobody 
vincent chiarella a printer accused of illegally trading stocks 
based on secret information he obtained by reading tenderoffer 
documents he printed 
arkin successfully argued an appeal before the supreme court in 
1980 and the conviction was overturned in what became a landmark 
decision about what defined an inside trader 
he also represents father bruce ritter former head of covenant 
house a wellknown charitable organization based in new york 
tainted by allegations of financial irregularities and sexual 
misconduct his matrimonial clients include richard snyder chief 
executive officer of simon amp schuster and tonight show host 
johnny carson

the agriculture department said monday it 
would undertake a more searching look at iraqi credit purchases of 
us farm products including payments above the market price that 
may have provided cash rebates 
officials said an administrative review so far uncovered no 
evidence to suggest that there has been diversion of commodities 
sold to iraq for illegal purposes 
undersecretary richard crowder in releasing a report of the 
review said the us government has not incurred any losses as 
a result of iraqs use of the program 
the departments review involved credit guarantees for up to 
three years the department through its commodity credit corp 
does not lend the money but stands behind commercial banks who do 
iraq has used the guarantees to buy more than 45 billion worth 
of us commodities since 1983 
kelly shipp spokeswoman for agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said about 30 million is left in the first 500 million 
worth of guarantees for iraq this fiscal year a decision on the 
second 500 million will be held up while the additional review is 
made 
among the potential irregularities checked by the department was 
a stamp tax of an unspecified amount that iraq had requested of 
some exporters iraq has agreed to exempt the credit shipments in 
the future officials 
the report said the administrative review which included a 
visit to baghdad last month suggested additional inquiry into two 
key areas 
one question involves the extent and reasons for high prices in 
certain transactions including corn rice and sugar during 1985 
to 1987 prices paid by iraq appeared to be at least 10 per metric 
ton higher than typical world prices for rice and corn and 15 to 
40 higher for sugar 
it appears that these price levels may have resulted in part 
from supplier perceptions that iraq was a very highrisk market due 
to wartime conditions with iran the report said 
other possible reasons may have been the limited number of 
us suppliers who were willing to deal in this highrisk market 
when iraq was at war with iran and iraqs policy of seeking 
freight financing which only a few suppliers were able or willing 
to provide 
another uncertainty was the extent of services that may have 
been provided in connection with the credit sales and whether the 
values of those sales were properly reported 
the report said these services requested of exporters by iraq 
appear to have been in the form of either additional agricultural 
products nonagricultural products such as truck parts or tires 
cash rebates or discounts or use of designated iraqi shipping 
companies 
officials said the review began last fall after the department 
learned of allegations that approximately 720 million of 
guaranteed loans were part of a loan portfolio under federal 
investigation in atlanta 
allegedly the cccguaranteed loans were part of a clandestine 
loan operation in which officials of the atlanta branch of the 
banca nazionale del lavoro had booked more than 2 billion in 
unauthorized and unreported loans to iraq the report said 
federal grand jury proceedings in the atlanta case have yet to 
produce indictments and no details are available the report said

the stock market reached a new high for the 
fourth time in the past six sessions monday getting still more 
mileage out of its spring rally 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 2477 points to

interest rates were mixed to slightly lower in the credit 
markets monday yields on longterm government bonds hovered in the 
868 percent872 percent range 
but analysts said hopes persisted that rates could soon resume a 
more emphatic decline 
the upsurge in stock prices since the end of april has been 
attributed largely to falling interest rates and accompanying 
assurances that the federal reserve seems less and less likely to 
tighten credit 
fresh support for that view is expected on thursday when the 
commerce department reports on the gross national product for the 
first quarter of the year analysts project that the data will show 
growth at an annual rate of 15 percent to 17 percent down from 
an earlier estimate of 21 percent 
another positive influence was mondays word that the government 
had a largerthanexpected budget surplus of 4252 billion in 
april against 4057 billion in april 1989 
the widened surplus in a month when treasury accounts are 
typically swollen by peak tax receipts was seen as a hopeful

cable tv seemed to have something for everyone at 
an industry convention a cowboy channel in court television for 
law junkies even a senior citizen network for viewers who 
werent born yesterday 
the big question at the national cable television association 
convention monday seemed to be how to sell so many choices to 
viewers 
dozens of displays by huge variety of cable outlets greeted 
visitors 
alongside the established networks such as turner broadcasting 
system incs family of channels and familiar faces hbo mtv and 
espn were a host of new choices 
among the many starting or planning to broadcast were the law 
channel country star willie nelsons cowboy channel to carry 
western movies and country music videos and golden american 
network for senior citizens 
the narrow focus of many of these new channels reflects the 
industrys growing strategy of targeting niche channels cable 
officials said 
cable executives participating in a panel discussion monday said 
that technology expected to arrive in this decade will greatly 
expand the capacity of local cable systems to carry more channels 
that means programming may be sold the way magazines are targeted 
at specificinterest audiences 
the key will be whether the special interest channels can 
succeed with an audience of less than 1 million subscribers said 
charles dolan chairman of cablevision systems corp of woodbury 
ny 
by contrast the seven largest cable channels all currently are 
available to more than 50 million subscribers 
the challenge is to find large enough niches said john 
malone president of telecommunications inc of denver 
some executives suggested a package of specialinterest stations 
could be sold to the viewer that would be in contrast to todays 
broad basic service which might include programming without 
interest for any particular customer 
such a limited service might be viable with niche 
sponsorship if advertisers were willing to pay a higher rate for 
commercial time knowing that the audience was a prime target for 
their product malone said 
but robert miron president of newhouse broadcasting of north 
syracuse ny cautioned that it would be dangerous to destroy 
broadbased basic cable service 
such concerns are being debated in the conference rooms during 
the threeday meeting but on the exhibit floor its all showbiz 
nelson who is the chairman of the board of the cowboy channel 
drew a long line of conventioneers seeking his autograph the only 
longer line was the one to meet renee tenison playboy magazines 
1990 playmate of the year who was signing autographs at the 
playboy at night networks booth 
the big shots of the industry appeared to be in a contest for 
who could construct the most impressive promotional booth the 
disney channels for example was a sprawling white and silver 
castle each side equipped with a trio of tv screens showing disney 
programs 
not surprisingly one of the largest exhibits belonged to 
atlantabased turner broadcasting the gleaming display included 
lounge areas and private meeting rooms

kobori a dealer with the bank of tokyo 
the dollar closed monday at 15373 yen in new york up from 
15300 yen last friday 
the dollars gain in new york resulted from a market belief that 
the federal reserve wont ease its credit policies anytime soon 
keeping interest rates at current levels higher rates tend to 
support a currency 
kobori said trading in tokyo is hardly moving mainly because 
there is no major marketaffecting news here now 
traders attributed the nikkeis early fell to the yens 
continuing weakness agaisnt the dollar which discouraged stock 
investors and sent them to the sidelines 
in bond dealings the price of the benchmark no 119 10year

a soviet policymaker said his countrys 
economic restructuring will be jeopardized without the help of us 
farm technology to improve agricultural production 
support us help us out share your knowhow ivan skiba 
chief of the agrarian department of the central committee of the 
soviet communist party told an audience of academics businessmen 
and farm leaders monday 
a harvard economist however was pessimistic about the 
prospects for success in the reforms being pushed by soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev 
gorbachev has inherited a very sick society unfortunately 
hes made it worse said marshall goldman associate director of 
the russian research center at harvard 
the exchange came at iowa state university at a symposium on 
economic and political reforms in the ussr 
skiba said agriculture is a top soviet priority 
without it further movement in perestroika would be vexed 
he said 
skiba said the problem of soviet food supplies is becoming more 
acute despite increased production he said major investments and 
joint ventures are needed 
major priorities are improving food storage and processing and 
developing an openmarket economy said alexander nikonov 
president of the lenin allunion academy of agricultural sciences 
and a top advisor to gorbachev 
nikonov said losses from grain and commodity spoilage are valued 
at five times soviet farm imports 
skiba predicted radical changes in soviet grain purchases 
expanding on a shift that began in recent years toward increased 
interest in soybeans and soybean products to enhance the protein 
content of livestock feed 
skiba said soviet inflation is running at 75 percent peasants 
are not accepting programs aimed at moving to private ownership of 
land and continued subsidizes to ensure low food prices are no 
longer defensible economically 
in moscow a document obtained monday by the associated press 
showed that the kremlin plans to double food prices as part of 
desperately needed economic reforms to gradually introduce a market 
economy 
goldman said the soviet economy is in more serious trouble with 
inflation running as high as 20 percent and the economy actually 
contracting at a real rate of at least 5 percent food products are 
rationed in almost every large city he said 
the soviet budget deficit has ballooned to 10 percent to 12 
percent of gross national product compared with a us deficit 
equivalent to 3 percent to 4 percent of gnp he said 
i think prospects for reform are dim goldman said

the nations top bank regulator told new 
england governors monday he will tour the region to help spread the 
message that banks should continue making good loans 
the promised visits by comptroller of the currency robert l 
clarke come in response to continued complaints that tough federal 
regulations are discouraging loans to small businesses throughout 
the northeast 
regulators under clarkes control are winding up several months 
of extensive examinations into real estate lending at major new 
england banks but according to the governors the repercussions 
of their work are still being felt by small and mediumsized 
businesses that have been unable to continue lines of credit due to 
the tightened lending climate 
the bottomline conclusion that i want to get across as a 
result of this meeting is that we are not telling banks not to lend 
money clarke said at a news conference in his office 
were telling banks to be careful in the way they lend 
money clarke said but there are still plenty of good loans to 
be made 
clarke met with governors michael dukakis of massachusetts judd 
gregg of new hampshire and john mckernan of maine howard brown 
connecticuts banking commissioner also attended the governors 
met earlier in the day with alan greenspan chairman of the federal 
reserve board 
clarke said the socalled credit crunch in new england may stem 
from an overreaction by banks to the heightened scrutiny by federal 
regulators allaying the concerns of bankers he said would be a 
major purpose of his visits 
i have agreed to make several appearances in the northeast 
over the next month and i will be getting that message out said 
clarke whose office is responsible for examing national banks 
its almost inevitable that if you have a slowdown in certain 
economic sectors that youre going to have a tightening of credit 
standards i dont think thats inappropriate clarke said 
what would be inappropriate would be to just have a blanket 
shutting off of the faucet 
the governors did not blame new englands slumping economy on 
the tight credit climate created by banking regulators but dukakis 
said innocent bystanders are being hurt 
were concerned about what has happened to the small and 
mediumsized companies in new england who are good risks and are 
the heart and soul of the new england economy because they create 
most of our new jobs and whose credit is being affected because of 
what has happened on the real estate side dukakis said 
a hotline set up in massachusetts has heard complaints from some 
250 companies haveing difficulty obtaining or continuing credit and 
the state is working directly with about 50 of them dukakis said 
brown who represented connecticut gov william oneill at the 
meeting said federal regulators who look at loans to small 
businesses may not have a good feel for the asset quality and the 
persons behind those loans 
federal examiners have among other things ordered banks to 
reclassify as nonperforming loans that have been kept current 
brown said they have also told banks to increase their reserves 
for bad loans taking out of circulation money that might go out as

procter amp gamble cos new chairman told stock 
analysts the company plans to emphasize international sales during 
the next year 
if we do it right it will be our principal engine of 
growth edwin l artzt said to about 100 analysts referring to 
overseas sales 
he also said the company will attempt to cut production and 
distribution costs by 1 billion during the next two years 
artzt who became the companys chairman and chief executive 
officer in january was head of pampgs european division from 1975 
to 1980 the twohour meeting was his first with analysts the 
companys new fiscal year begins july 31 
pampg plans to expand development of such products as tide laundry 
detergent and pampers diapers which sell worldwide but are 
tailored to meet local market requirements artzt said 
artzt showed nearly identical television commercials for pampg 
shampoo from the united states japan and britain to illustrate the 
companys ability to introduce the same product in different 
markets 
our concept of globalization does not mean we plan to run our 
business globally my long experience on the international business 
has convinced me that that would not work he said 
emphasizing international sales is pampgs most realistic way to 
maintain earnings growth in its core businesses of soap and 
personal care products said hugh zurkuhlen an analyst for salomon 
brothers 
the domestic markets for soap and toothpaste dont grow 
but discretionary spending is still growing in southeast asia and 
latin america he said as long as theres world peace there 
is good potential for growth overseas 
artzt said the company expects to maintain sales growth in the 
united states through innovations such as diapers designed 
especially for boys or girls 
in 23 of our 41 us categories our company market share is 
less than 25 percent he said just getting to a 25 percent 
share would add about 300 million after tax to our bottom line 
in those categories 
pampg has reduced proposed uses for its experimental fat 
substitute olestra so it can win faster us food and drug 
administration approval for the product artzt said he said the 
company would propose broader uses later

sundstrand corp has agreed to abide by 
federal securities laws that regulators said it ignored while 
overbilling the government on defense contracts 
the aerospace contractor although neither admitting nor denying 
charges it violated securities laws agreed to a permanent 
injunction in us district court monday barring it from 
disregarding accounting and financial reporting rules in the future 
sundstrand also agreed to set up a committee of independent 
directors to review whether the companys fraud case led to 
violations not addressed by the securities and exchange commission 
in its complaint 
the settlement subject to approval by a judge would end the 
secs investigation 
sundstrand pleaded guilty in 1988 to overbilling the government 
on defense contracts for airplane parts and paid nearly 200 
million to settle the case the biggest penalty ever assessed for 
defense fraud 
the commission charged that by concealing millions of dollars in 
cost overruns between 1980 and 1986 sundstrand misled investors by 
underestimating its debts and overstating its profits 
sec lawyer wendy d fox said the injunction was necessary to 
ensure sundstrand will comply with security laws in the future 
sundstrand has settled this matter in order to avoid 
protracted and costly litigation over practices long since 
discontinued by this company said harry c stonecipher 
president and chief executive officer 
sundstrand has moved on and the injunction will have no 
financial impact on the company it obliges us to do what we would 
do in any event that is to comply with the law
