negotiators for the 22000member teachers 
union met again sunday with school district representatives to seek 
a solution to a weekold teacher walkout that has caused chaos in 
city classrooms 
representatives of the los angeles unified school district 
arrived around 815 pm more than two hours after united 
teacherlos angeles negotiators showed up for talks set to begin at 
6 pm said utla spokesman catherine carey 
it looks like the other side is dragging its feet and trying 
to prolong this thing ms carey said before they arrived she 
added that teachers were prepared for a second week in the walkout 
that began may 15 
well have our teachers out on the line again she said 
theyve invested too much at this point 
details of developments in recent talks have been sketchy 
because of a news blackout imposed by state mediator draz mrvichin 
the walkout last week played havoc with education in the nearly 
600000 student district many students walked out of classes and 
some joined teachers on picket lines in some cases students were 
housed in auditoriums because the district was unable to hire 
enough substitute teachers to fill classrooms 
during the 16monthlong labor dispute teachers have sought 
higher salaries and more say in how the districts 600plus schools 
are run 
teachers earn between 23440 and 43319 a year depending on 
experience and level of education the union wants a threeyear 
contract with a 26 percent raise including a 10 percent raise the 
first year 
the district the second largest in the nation has refused to 
go higher than a 215 percent raise over three years 
the strike which began may 15 is the districts first since a 
23day walkout in 1970

soldiers on sunday set up roadblocks to beijings 
center and moved into its train station but hundreds of thousands 
of students defied martial law and remained in tiananmen square 
despite fears of an army crackdown 
large prodemocracy demonstrations also were reported in several 
other cities in shanghai more than 300000 people rallied on the 
waterfront of the huangpu river and 200000 more gathered in the 
citys peoples square 
the only violence reported was a clash between armed police and 
students in western beijing on saturday in which students said they 
were attacked with electric cattle prods one student injured in 
the attack said 45 students were hospitalized 
the thousands of students staging a weekold hunger strike in 
the 100acre tiananmen square ended their fast saturday saying 
they needed to regain their strength in case troops moved in 
students and their supporters in the square early sunday 
numbered about 200000 protests since the hunger strike began have 
drawn hundreds of thousands 
the hunger strikers initially demanded a dialogue with the 
government on reform to be broadcast live and an apology for an 
initial official declaration that the student democracy movement 
was a plot against the party 
but after premier li peng declared martial law in parts of the 
capital saturday to put an end to the protests most students and 
their supporters demanded li resign 
the armys move sunday apparently was aimed at stopping the flow 
of tens of thousands of people to the capital to join the protests 
citizens blockaded the station by parking coal trucks across the 
road and hundreds of students sat in front of it as a further 
barrier 
the army set up roadblocks around the capital about 12 miles 
from the city center said a chinese source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the source said 60000 to 70000 troops moved into the city 
center by subway sunday and followed connecting tunnels to the 
walled palace the history museum and the great hall of the people 
on three sides of tiananmen square the subway was closed to 
regular traffic as of noon saturday 
there was no outward sign of the reported troop presence in the 
city center and it could not be confirmed 
inside tiananmen square the sun rose sunday on a triumphant but 
weary and bedraggled crowd of at least 200000 students medical 
workers and ordinary citizens the students spent the night sitting 
in rows with gauze wound around their mouths and noses for 
protection against a possible tear gas attack 
around the square and on roads throughout the city citizens 
barricaded the way with buses trucks and anything available 
thousands also surrounded tanks and trucks filled with soldiers at 
several points in the suburbs immobilizing them 
the people are strong an elderly woman marveled as the long 
night ended peacefully 
but soon after five army helicopters swooped twice over the 
square as they did repeatedly saturday reminding the protesters 
the standoff was not over the students waved and cheered defiantly 
the danger is not over said a medical student who was 
helping care for about 3000 of the students who were weakened by 
the hunger strike 
student leaders had said over a loudspeaker saturday night that 
the protesters should not resist if the army came 
our principle is peaceful nonresistance they said 
on sunday the student leaders held lengthy private meetings to 
discuss their next step nothing was immediately announced some 
reportedly favored staying in the square while others wanted to 
join citizens confronting army vehicles 
the widely ignored martial law regulations include bans on 
marches class boycotts distribution of pamphlets speeches the 
spreading of rumors attacks on party government or military 
organs and any other destructive actions 
lis hardline stand toward the students appears to have forced 
the resignation of the more liberal communist party general 
secretary zhao ziyang 
chinese sources said zhao highly respected for his pioneering 
work in economic reforms resigned his post after failing to 
persuade li and senior leader deng xiaoping to compromise with the 
students there has been no official word on zhaos future 
lis political victory could be brief however if the military 
refuses to cooperate in the crackdown 
britain on saturday urged that the chinese government and 
demonstrators use restraint and moderation in the crisis the 
united states and france recommended that their citizens not travel 
to the country 
protesters in beijing have demanded deng retire 
deng 84 is widely admired for initiating marketoriented 
reforms in china but he has come under sharp attack by students 
for holding onto power too long and letting political reform lag 
behind his economic reforms 
the students began the protests on april 15 after the death of 
former communist party chief hu yaobang a leading reformer who was 
ousted from his post for not cracking down on earlier student 
protests 
the rallies gradually grew in size as workers and others joined 
in and evolved into the biggest show of defiance in chinas 40 
years of communist rule

to the british foreign office in london and told by sir john 
fretwell the deputy permanent undersecretary that 11 soviets were 
engaged in activities incompatible with their status and must 
leave in 14 days a british foreign office spokesman said in london 
the spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping with british 
custom said britain had not planned to make public the expulsions 
and did so only after the soviets retalitated 
the spokesman refused to say what the soviets were accused of 
doing but the charge he used of incompatible activities is 
diplomatic jargon for espionage 
lyne said the britons ordered expelled from moscow were embassy

spying on military installations

unidentified diplomats as saying those expelled from britain 
include soviet journalists 
the expulsions of british and soviet nationals are the first 
since the two countries expelled 31 of each others citizens four 
years ago 
the 1985 dispute began when london ordered 25 soviets to leave 
after they were identified as secret agents by soviet defector oleg 
gordievsky 
in addition to the 11 britons ordered expelled saturday lyne 
said three british diplomats who had already completed their tours 
of assignment in moscow last year were declared persona non

five syrian gunboats intercepted a 
freighter carrying supplies for lebanons besieged christians and 
forced it to return to cyprus an army spokesman said sunday 
the syrians use of their naval forces along with intensified 
weekend shelling marked a tightening of the blockade on the 
christians coastal enclave 
the spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
identified the lebaneseowned vessel as the cedars and said it was 
intercepted at dawn saturday as it was heading to a harbor near the 
northern city of tripoli 
christian sources say syria has based a flotilla of gunboats in 
tripoli which is syriancontrolled despite israels traditional 
control of lebanons mediterranean coastline 
it was the first known syrian interception of a ship heading for 
the christian enclave despite daily shelling of the christian 
ports several small freighters have made it through 
police said syrian artillery in and around moslem west beirut 
pounded the enclaves coastline with 200 shells and rockets 
saturday and sunday in another violation of an arab league 
ceasefire declared may 11 
the bombardment the heaviest since the ceasefire was called 
targeted a 10milelong stretch of beach between the ports of 
jounieh and byblos police reported 
the syrians and their druse moslem militia allies have been 
shelling the christian ports to prevent ships with food or weapons 
from reaching the enclave no casualties were reported in the 
latest attacks 
at least 359 people have been killed and 1393 wounded since 
fighting began march 8 between army commander gen michel aouns 
mainly christian troops and the alliance of syrian and druse forces 
aoun who heads a christian cabinet vying for power with a rival 
moslem government accused syria of sending reconnaissance jets on 
provocative runs over the enclave for the first time during the 
confrontation 
he charged that israels failure to challenge the syrian 
penetration of what the israelis consider their air forces 
preserve was evidence of a backstage understanding between syria 
and israel on maintaining their occupation of lebanon 
the syrians have 40000 troops with tanks deployed in lebanon 
mostly in moslem territory under an increasingly discredited 1976 
arab league peacekeeping mandate israel occupies a border strip in 
south lebanon 
aoun contends the syrians have lost their credibility as 
peacekeepers by siding with the moslem side he has declared a 
war of liberation to drive out the syrians whose forces 
outnumber his troops 4to1 
the last known syrian air force flights over lebanon were in the 
early days of israels 1982 invasion israel claimed it shot down 
80 syrian jets over the syriancontrolled bekaa valley in east 
lebanon then 
aoun also charged that syria and its allies were bent on 
detonating a new security blowup in lebanon before an arab 
summit tuesday to discuss ways of ending lebanons 14yearold 
civil war 
he said arab heads of state must not allow syria to swallow 
lebanon and he urged soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev to 
intervene to stop the bombardment of the christian enclave moscow 
is syrias main arms supplier 
acting prime minister salim hoss who heads the prosyrian 
cabinet messaged arab leaders gathering for the summit that a 
syrian pullout from lebanon can only be demanded by a unified 
lebanese government

illustrate five military helicopters swept into view and circled 
the square twice

president richard von weizsaeckers 
patrician lineage and eloquent oratory satisfy a longing of his 
countrymen for a royal statesman who can skillfully temper their 
past sins with postwar achievements 
his rise from the shadow of his fathers role in the nazi 
leadership to what is now the most respected federal office mirrors 
the stunning west german recovery from wartime ruin and testifies 
to the resilience of a modern family dynasty 
weizsaecker will be reelected without opposition tuesday to a 
second term as head of state by the federal convention which meets 
every five years to elect a president 
each of the five political parties represented in the federal 
parliament is entitled to nominate a candidate but for the first 
time in the nations 40year history the vote will be uncontested 
weizsaecker a member of chancellor helmut kohls conservative 
christian democratic union has won endorsement of all but the 
farleft greens party which nonetheless decided against running a 
challenger 
the unusual unity displayed by west germanys diverse and 
fractious political parties reflects the respect the 69yearold 
weizsaecker has won during his first term as president 
in the latest nationwide poll conducted by the institute for 
opinion research in allensbach weizsaecker drew an approval rating 
of more than 85 percent 
a man who by nature keeps above the political fray weizsaecker 
has transformed the mostly ceremonial office of president into an 
influential post of elder statesman and curator of a national 
conscience 
his articulate address on the 40th anniversary of the end of 
world war ii won praise worldwide as an effort to bring fellow 
germans to terms with the holocaust they perpetrated 
guilt is like innocence not collective but personal the 
president said all of us whether guilty or not whether young 
or old must accept the past we are all affected by its 
consequences and liable for it 
but striking a chord of balance with west germans weary of the 
shame bequeathed by their forebears weizsaecker also has called 
for a fair assessment of the accomplishments of his state built on 
the smoldering ruins of the third reich 
chapters of his own past have been a burden borne unflinchingly 
born in stuttgart on april 15 1920 to a titled family of 
intellectuals weizsaecker began his studies in 1937 at oxford 
where he perfected the english he speaks fluently today then 
joined adolf hitlers army in 1938 
he marched into poland with his infantry regiment on the first 
day of world war ii lost a brother in the invasion and continued 
to serve until the german capitulation may 8 1945 
after resuming his law studies he served as deputy defense 
council for his father ernst von weizsaecker who was sentenced at 
the 1947 nuremberg trials to eight years in prison for his role as 
a deputy foreign minister in the nazi leadership 
while weizsaecker is generally revered by west germans critics 
can be found at both political extremes 
ultrarightist leader franz schoenhuber whose service in the 
waffen ss continues to haunt his political career complained 
recently that he is called to account repeatedly for the nazi 
period while weizsaecker has remained virtually untouched 
greens spokesman michael schroerer said his party which polls 
less than 10 percent declined to support weizsaecker more for 
what he hasnt done than for any misdeed contending the 
president could more actively address residual problems of 
discrimination and injustice 
some prominent greens like otto schily however have said they 
plan to vote for weizsaecker 
ingeborg menz of the federal parliament office explained that 
the federal convention at which the president will be elected for a 
second and final term is made up of the 519 federal parliament 
members and an equal number of delegates from the 11 state 
legislatures 
an avid sportsman frequently pictured skiing or 
mountainclimbing weiszaecker is chosen most often as a model for 
young germans said spokesman edgar piel of the institute for 
opinion research 
piel said west germans respect weizsaecker because of his image 
as a moral and noble statesman allowing them to maintain an ersatz 
monarchy 
the von in the family name stems from the title of baron 
bestowed on his grandfather in 1916 by the royal family of 
wuerttemberg 
after managerial stints in steel banking and pharmaceuticals 
weizsaecker was head of the german protestant church from 1964 to 
1970 he served in the federal parliament from 1969 through his 
election as mayor of west berlin a highprofile post that 
propelled him into the presidency in 1984 
weizsaecker has traveled frequently since his election 
including making the first west german presidential visit to israel 
in 1985 helping to mold the nations affluent and sophisticated 
postwar image

for much of her life helen suzman has fought 
apartheid in south africa sometimes the single lonely voice 
calling for reform last week she announced she will retire from 
parliament after 36 years here is a look at her work 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
back in 1963 a legislator of 
the governing national party said of helen suzman who 
singlehandedly represented the antiapartheid opposition her 
days in parliament are numbered 
that wouldbe prophet cas greyling has since left parliament 
as has every one of his contemporaries except the indomitable woman 
he derided her days in office number some 13200 
last week mrs suzman 71 announced she will not seek 
reelection in september ending a 36year parliamentary career 
few politicians anywhere have served so long in opposition to such 
an entrenched governing party and fought so determinedly for their 
convictions 
for 13 of those years from 1961 to 1974 she was the only 
member of parliament speaking out against apartheid and campaigning 
for black rights during a 15week session in 1961 she made 66 
speeches offered 26 amendments and submitted 137 questions to 
parliamentary leaders 
i dont know how i made so many speeches she said i 
wrote every one myself thats why they were so lousy they were 
not flowing speeches but the contents have pleased me when i look 
back at these speeches i still think i have taken the right line 
she has been lauded as the conscience of white south africa 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain was among those 
saluting her last week yet despite the accolades mrs suzman 
departed only slightly from her customary modesty 
without actually saying i told you so it has been a source 
of considerable satisfaction to have been in parliament over the 
past 10 years when many of the laws i opposed when they were 
introduced have been repealed she told her colleagues thursday 
she referred to the repeal of laws prohibiting interracial 
marriages reserving certain jobs for whites and requiring blacks 
to have permits to be in whitesonly areas 
the sowetan the countrys largest blackoriented daily 
newspaper said many blacks owe her gratitude for the battles she 
has fought 
the great pity is that south africa simply was not good enough 
to have a person such as herself as the head of state the 
sowetan said 
mrs suzman says her worst moment in parliament came in 1966 
when prime minister hendrik verwoerd was fatally stabbed by a 
deranged assassin a few yards away from her pw botha defense 
minister at the time and now president told her as he rushed past 
you liberals did this now we will get you 
mrs suzman did not speak to botha for several years and their 
relationship remains distant they served together in parliament 
from 1953 until botha became president in 1985 in one exchange in 
1981 botha warned her not to break the law and she replied i 
am not frightened of you i never have been and never will be i 
think nothing of you 
botha also will retire in september 
one of mrs suzmans roles has been that of prophet in 1981 
referring to the unrest she said if it gets really bad the 
government might suspend the law and rule by edict in 1986 
botha imposed a national state of emergency that remains in force 
mrs suzman predicted last week that blacks eventually will gain 
political rights and that remaining segregation laws will waste 
away or be repealed though alas i will not be here to 
welcome their disappearance 
mrs suzman was born helen gavronksy daughter of jewish 
immigrants from lithuania she enrolled at johannesburgs 
university of the witwatersrand at 16 married physician moses 
suzman at 19 and later taught at witwatersrand before running for 
parliament in 1952 from houghton a wealthy johannesburg district 
she has served ever since 
militants in later years urged her to quit saying a parliament 
that excluded blacks was no place for a genuine foe of apartheid 
but she is convinced she played a vital role by keeping 
certain values alive 
her approach to politics was simple she said last week if 
you stick to basic principles you dont ever have to regret what 
you said 
other assessments of her career were less restrained 
only an extraordinary commitment to her political ideas could 
have carried her through the long years when she alone upheld the 
banner of civilization in parliament said business day a 
johannesburg newspaper she held a torch aloft in time of 
darkness

chinas students repeatedly have called for 
reforms over the past decade but current prodemocracy 
demonstrations in beijing and other cities are by far the largest 
and boldest communist china has faced 
student dissent has been gathering strength since senior leader 
deng xiaoping took power and initiated his policies of reform in 
the late 1970s 
the first open challenge to the government came in the democracy 
wall movement of 197879 the movement was so named because 
protesters wrote posters demanding freedom and complaining about a 
wide range of social ills and tacked them to a wall in western 
beijing 
deng seeking to wrest power held by leftists left over from the 
196676 cultural revolution allowed the movement as long as it 
focused on the wrongs of the past when criticisms began to hit 
closer to home he cracked down 
dozens of dissidents were arrested including wei jingsheng who 
was sentenced to 15 years in prison for counterrevolutionary 
activities wei remains behind bars 
the harsh measures effectively muffled democratic dissent for 
about five years during the 1980s students occasionally launched 
protests on their abysmal living conditions the presence of 
factories and army troops on campuses and crime but they stayed 
away from political issues 
in december 1984 for example 5000 beijing university students 
marched on the university presidents home to complain about 
unheated dormitories and an 11 pm lightsout policy 
dissent took a political turn in september 1985 when 1000 
students congregated at tiananmen square to condemn what they said 
was japans economic invasion of china 
the authorities disturbed when students shifted from 
criticizing japan to talking about rising food prices and 
government corruption launched a propaganda campaign that stifled 
the unrest 
but a little more than a year later in december 1986 the 
students rose up again in demonstrations and protests that spread 
to dozens of cities students demanded greater campus autonomy 
less bureaucratic control over their lives and a more democratic 
society 
tens of thousands flooded the streets of shanghai beijing 
students staged allnight marches to tiananmen square 
the demonstrations ran their course in a month and the 
government responded with a chilling campaign against bourgeois 
liberalization or the attraction to western liberal thinking 
three leading intellectuals including astrophysicist fang 
lizhi were purged from the communist party for allegedly fomenting 
the unrest and communist party general secretary hu yaobang 
regarded as sympathetic to the students was ousted by party 
conservatives 
the prodemocracy movement again went underground 
it surfaced in june 1988 when 1000 beijing university students 
marched to tiananmen square to protest the slaying of a fellow 
student by a gang of ruffians activists took advantage of the 
student anger to put up posters denouncing official corruption and 
demanding democratic reforms 
the current explosion of protest was triggered by the death 
april 15 of former party chief hu students took to the streets to 
mourn the man they feel was wronged by the party but more 
importantly to express again all they felt was wrong with chinas 
political system 
mass protests have not been confined to students in the past 
decade 
farmers have protested pollution and official profiteering 
unemployed youth have marched for jobs and people sent to the 
countryside during the cultural revolution have demanded to be 
allowed to return to their city homes 
tibetans seeking independence from china have protested 
violently three times since october 1987 and the minority uyghurs 
of far western china have demonstrated against nuclear testing in 
their region 
this month 2500 chinese moslems emboldened by the 
prodemocracy demonstrators marched through the streets of beijing 
to demand the banning of a chinese book they said blasphemed their 
religion it was banned

in virginia you can earn a 4 monthly credit 
on your electric bill by letting the utility cut power to your 
water heater for a few hours a few times a month 
in southern new jersey you can get a onetime cash rebate from 
the utility of up to 619 for replacing your air conditioner with a 
more efficient one 
an arizona utility offers to knock 75 off your bill if you put 
a reflective film on your homes windows to block out the 
ultraviolet rays of the desert sun 
across the country with some stark exceptions electric 
utilities are pouring money into programs aimed at encouraging 
energy efficiency and shifting the use of electricity from the peak 
periods of demand to other times 
theres a big move starting up says stephen wiel chairman 
of the energy conservation committee of the national association of 
regulatory utility commissioners 
the main reason demands on the power supply system are growing 
so rapidly that utilities are nearing the point of having to invest 
in new sources of supply the colossal failure of many past 
investments in nuclear power plants is a powerful disincentive to 
risk the billions needed for new construction 
virginia power figures its program of interrupting power to 
145000 residential water heaters has saved it the need to add 150 
megawatts of generating capacity the equivalent of a small power 
plant says spokesman carl baab 
utilities in some parts of the country have been tinkering with 
electricity demand mainly to even out the daily and seasonal 
peaks and valleys for several years but the trend is now 
accelerating as the utilities realize load management as its 
called in the business can mean more profits 
heres how by encouraging customers to use less power in the 
peak periods of summer and winter and to use more the rest of the 
time a utility can boost its overall electricity sales without 
having to add to its maximum generating capacity 
the reason were doing this is that its just good business 
says thomas morron a vice president of edison electric institute 
an industry association 
for consumers these programs can mean lower electric bills the 
savings come not only from using more efficient appliances and 
heating and cooling systems but also from avoiding the rate 
increases that plant construction can bring 
william mccollam jr president of edison electric recently 
estimated the number of utilitysponsored energy efficiency 
programs had grown from 134 in 1977 to nearly 1300 last year 
he said this has allowed the industry to avoid adding 21000 
megawatts of new capacity over the past decade the equivalent of 
about 21 large generating plants a single plant that size would be 
expected to cost at least 1 billion 
after a decade of slow growth electricity sales in the past two 
years jumped by about 5 percent a year experts differ on the 
outlook for future growth but most agree demand could outstrip 
supply in the 1990s unless new generating capacity is added 
this is a key reason for the emphasis now on efficiency gains 
and programs that can postpone the day when a utility must decide 
how to supplement its power supply 
the trend is not uniform however some utilities have a surplus 
of power and are aggressively peddling it 
ohio edison co is offering financial incentives for natural gas 
customers to convert their water heaters to electric and to buy 
heaters that will run electric as well as on oil or gas 
were loaded with power the idea is to sell it said dw 
bettiker coordinator of residential sales for ohio edison weve 
never had a conservation program 
some of the utility programs are billed as conservation efforts 
but increasingly the term efficiency is substituted to reflect 
the goal of stretching the use of each kilowatthour of power 
rather than eliminating some uses 
one of the tough nuts to crack is the customers perception 
that conservation means deprivation said morron conservation 
doesnt mean you have to put on a hair shirt and go live in a 
cave 
rather than being urged to turn down the thermostat in winter 
consumers are being told they can save money and still stay warm by 
getting a more efficient heater 
one of the most innovative utility programs is at central maine 
power it hired an energy services company sesco inc of 
springfield mass to make efficiency improvements in about 11000 
residences sesco pays for the improvements such as attic 
insulation window calking and lighting changes and the utility 
pays sesco for measurable reductions in each homes electricity use 
the deal is set so the utility is assured of paying less for the 
conservation than it would have paid to buy that amount of energy 
from an outside supplier or to build a new power plant to generate 
the additional electricity the utility customers pay nothing for 
the efficiency improvements and are expected to save 2 million in 
charges in the first year of the program 
if all goes well its a winwin situation said frank 
chiaravalloti a central maine spokesman 
although a growing number of utilities are starting or expanding 
conservation and efficiency programs some experts say regulatory 
changes will be needed before the industry taps fully into the deep 
reservoir of savings potential 
the key problem from the utilities viewpoint is that most state 
regulatory agencies do not allow the industry to earn a profit on 
their investment in conservation they are allowed to recover the 
cost but no more the result is that utilities may view increased 
conservation as decreased profits

booze inexperience and complacency 
conspired to cause the nations worst oil spill evidence and 
testimony suggest after a fiveday federal investigative hearing 
that found plenty of blame to spread around 
the national transportation safety board hearing on the exxon 
valdez oil spill concluded saturday board member lee dickinson 
said the agencys report probably will be issued in early 1990 
the hearing came nearly two months after the tanker ran aground 
on a charted reef and ripped its hull open bleeding nearly 11 
million gallons of crude oil into biologically rich prince william 
sound the oil has coated hundreds of miles of coast and killed 
birds and marine mammals 
there are any number of things that may have occurred some 
mistakes that were made and all those together may have been what 
led to the grounding of the exxon valdez dickinson said 
the 987foot tanker was heading south from valdez the night of 
march 23 with a load of alaskan crude when capt joseph hazelwood 
directed it across a northbound shipping lane to avoid chunks of 
ice from a glacier 
the captain received coast guard permission for the diversion 
but without approval the ship continued beyond the traffic lanes 
hazelwood handed over control to third mate gregory cousins and 
left the bridge several minutes before the tanker ran aground at 
1204 am march 24 
in nearly 45 hours of testimony not one of the 28 witnesses 
admitted doing anything wrong but their testimony and more than 
1000 pages of evidence implicate the following players 
hazelwood who has been charged with operating the ship while 
drunk and declined to testify because of his pending criminal 
trial testimony indicated he may have had a bloodalcohol level of 
022 percent at the time of the wreck five times the legal limit 
witnesses said they smelled alcohol on his breath before and after 
the wreck 
the captain also left cousins in charge knowing he was not 
certified to pilot the ship through the sound and hazelwood had 
the tanker on automatic pilot although company policy restricts use 
of the device to open water 
cousins who took the ship off automatic pilot 12 minutes 
before the crash but failed to turn the vessel away from bligh 
reef he testified that the ship didnt respond to his rudder 
changes but an onboard recorder indicated his turns were simply 
too late 
exxon shipping co which was aware of hazelwoods alcoholism 
but said it was unaware he had resumed drinking after undergoing 
hospital treatment in 1985 although the company president said 
exxon has a strict antidrinking policy employees testified they 
rarely saw evidence that the policy was enforced 
testimony also revealed that exxon had reduced its tanker crews 
in favor of increased automation 
alyeska pipeline service co operator of the alaskan oil 
pipeline and the valdez terminal which failed to respond as 
quickly to the disaster as it had estimated it would in its 
spillcontingency plan a barge used to carry equipment to the 
spill was empty when the ship ran aground and it took 10 hours to 
load it 
the coast guards radar shipmonitoring system traffic 
controllers in valdez testified the ship was not visible on radar 
after it left valdez narrows they blamed weather for decreasing 
the radars range that night 
witnesses were questioned by ntsb staffers and representatives 
of the coast guard state exxon and alyeska participants were 
aware their testimony may be admitted in court where exxon and 
alyeska face potentially huge liability costs 
government and industry officials tried to use the hearing to 
their best legal and political advantage 
exxons william deppe and alyeskas william howitt worked to 
elicit testimony that would show their companies did everything 
possible to avoid and then respond to the disaster 
through their questions they suggested that the spill was beyond 
containment that government got in the way and that the spill 
might have been avoided if the coast guard radar had been working 
properly 
state officials alleged the industry was unprepared for a large 
spill failed to follow its contingency plans and allowed 
conditions that led to the spill to go unchecked

eight republicans and three democrats are 
fighting in party primaries to emerge from the shadow of gov 
thomas h kean widely credited with pumping pride into a state 
that was long a favored target of standup comics 
but kean a republican who is barred by law from seeking a third 
consecutive term remains a central figure in the campaign 
especially among gop candidates who vying to inherit his mantle 
a millionaire from an old and influential new jersey family 
kean won office in 1981 by the narrowest margin in new jersey 
history defeating democratic rep james florio by less than 
onetwelfth of 1 percent of the vote 
by 1985 his popularity had soared and he won a second term by 
the widest margin in state history getting 62 percent of the black 
vote and widespread support among labor and democrats 
while the national republican party grew more conservative under 
reagan kean advanced a moderate doctrine and urged the gop to 
bring women blacks and other minorities into its fold 
he rose to national prominence delivering the keynote address 
at the republican national convention last year and winning praise 
from presidents reagan and bush for his education initiatives 
and he has been an unabashed new jersey booster appearing on 
television commercials that tout the garden state as an exciting 
place to visit a novel thought for most americans 
his popularity in a state where democrats far outnumber 
republicans makes him a tough act to follow 
its just like george bush trying to succeed ronald reagan 
you have enormously huge shoes to fill said roger stone a 
washingtonbased consultant who is running republican rep james 
courters campaign 
stone said kean was the first new jersey governor to use 
television to build a public image that reached beyond the states 
borders 
television is playing a crucial role in the primary and 
candidates are spending millions to broadcast their messages in the 
nations most expensive television markets 
although only about 400000 members of each party are expected 
to cast primary ballots candidates will pour more than 7 million 
into television advertising during the three weeks before the june 
6 primary 
when kean took office new jersey staggered under economic 
stagnation high unemployment rates and serious budget problems 
for most of his term kean rode an economic boom he doubled the 
size of the state budget during years when the treasury overflowed 
with 1 billion surpluses 
but the good times came to an abrupt halt before the primary 
season a predicted shortfall for next year grew to 500 million 
some budget analysts believe the gap could be as wide as 700 
million 
soaring auto insurance rates have dominated the primary race 
followed by debates over how to lower high local property tax rates 
and whether state taxes should be increased to solve the budget 
crisis 
growing traffic problems congestion and the problems of 
managing rapid growth in the nations most densely populated state 
also are big issues 
several of the candidates have likened themselves to kean 
courter former attorney general cary edwards and sen william 
gormley are close kean allies courter and edwards use keans name 
in slogans that appear below their ballot lines calling themselves 
tom kean republicans 
gormley and edwards are the most moderate candidates in the 
race courter assembly speaker chuck hadwick and sen gerald 
cardinale have carved images as conservative republicans 
among the democrats florio author of the federal superfund 
law is widely considered the virtually unbeatable frontrunner now 
in his third bid for the statehouse he has run a low profile 
campaign drawing criticism from his opponents for remaining silent 
on many key issues 
in spite of the stacked political odds liberal assemblyman alan 
karcher and princeton mayor barbara boggs sigmund daughter of rep 
lindy boggs dla and the late hale boggs are running spirited 
democratic campaigns 
three other republicans are running lowbudget campaigns they 
are former state tourism official lois rand retired coast guard 
capt thomas blomquist and james a kolyer an industrial arts

rep tony coelho owned an interest in a dairy 
management company at the same time he was pushing legislation to 
help maintain the profitability of some dairy farms a review of 
records shows 
coelho the house majority whip and thirdranking democrat in 
the chamber became a limited partner in dairy management 
associates in december 1983 according to his financial disclosure 
forms 
when he bought into the partnership with an investment valued at 
between 5000 and 15000 the california congressman was a member 
of the house livestock dairy and poultry subcommittee he became 
chairman in 1985 a position he held for two years during the time 
the controversial 1985 farm bill was passed 
coelhos financial dealings have been the subject of public 
interest since recent disclosures that a california savings and 
loan official purchased a 100000 bond for coelho when the 
congressman was unable to come up with the money 
dairy management associates developed a computer software 
program for managing dairy herds allowing farmers to determine 
things such as how much milk a cow produces and how much it eats 
coelhos aides said the program also is used by veterinarians 
fred hatfield a coelho aide said the congressman was 
comfortable enough in his mind to realize there was no potential 
for anything that he dairy or agriculture committee was going to 
pass that was going to impact directly on that investment 
no law or rule prevents members of congress from holding assets 
that might conflict with their official duties they are free to 
craft and vote on legislation that could affect their financial 
interests 
white house officials and other executive branch employees on 
the other hand are barred under the basic federal conflict of 
interest law from taking government action in which they or their 
immediate family has a financial interest unless they obtain a 
waiver the top penalty is two years in prison and a 10000 fine 
in 1985 coelho and thenrep james jeffords rvt introduced 
a bill that among other things would pay farmers not to produce 
milk at a time the industry was beset with surpluses 
the legislation which drew the ire of consumer and milkuser 
groups was described by coelho as a way to ease some producers out 
of dairying while retaining profitability for the rest 
ultimately congress passed legislation that called for modest 
cuts in the price support program but authorized federally 
subsidized buyouts of entire dairy herds 
ellen haas of public voice a selfstyled consumer lobby who 
fought coelho on dairy price support measures in 1985 said it 
stood to reason that if dairy farmers stay healthy they might be 
able to afford to buy computer software programs to manage herds 
she said she had no idea of coelhos investment at the time 
one argument for exempting congress from conflictofinterest 
statutes is that lawmakers must publicly disclose their holdings so 
voters can decide whether an official is acting for personal 
enrichment 
coelho listed his holding as dairy management associates in 1983 
in four following years the entry was less descriptive he 
simply stated on his financial disclosure forms that he had an 
interest in dma a california limited partnership 
coelho put his assets including his dma interest in a blind 
trust last june 
hatfield said coelho does not fill out his forms personally and 
speculated that an aide called the company by its acronym a 
pattern repeated annually 
partnership records on file in california the most recent was 
jan 18 1985 show coelhos general partner in dairy management 
associates was samuel a nash who formerly worked for coelhos 
accountant the company address was the same as the accountants 
office in merced calif 
hatfield coelhos aide said the congressman knew nash but not 
well he said dairy management associates has not had an office for 
several years 
another limited partner in dairy management is john mack the 
former aide to house speaker jim wright dtexas mack a close 
friend of coelhos resigned last week after an outpouring of 
criticism over a newspaper story detailing his attack on a woman in 
1973

a novel grassroots concept in drug testing 
pioneered by aids victims and their doctors is gaining momentum and 
soon may see its first victory with widely expected government 
approval of a treatment for a lethal aidsrelated pneumonia 
far from the ivory towers of academic medical centers the 
testing is being conducted in a few inner cities hard hit by the 
disease where local aids doctors and their patients search together 
to find treatments that work and disgard those that dont 
these community programs the two major ones are in new york 
and san francisco were begun by aids patients and physicians 
frustrated by the slow pace of academic and government research to 
turn out a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome and its 
deadly complications 
people with aids just decided to do it themselves said 
thomas hannon associate director of the community research 
initiative which operates out of an old loft building in new york 
where participating doctors administer experimental therapies to 
aids patients 
research data gathered by the new york group and the county 
community consortium in san francisco on an aerosol version of the 
drug pentamidine pursuaded a food and drug administration advisory 
committee earlier this month to recommend approval of the treatment 
to prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia the lung ailment kills 
60 percent of all aids victims 
the fda is widely expected to approve aerosoladministered 
pentamidine shortly 
pentamidine was approved by the fda as an injectable drug five 
years ago to treat those already suffering from pneumocystis many 
doctors though administered it as a spray in february the fda 
expanded pentamidines use in aerosol form as an experimental 
medication under government review 
as a spray the drug is delivered directly into the lungs where 
the pneumonia infection first shows up in this form pentamidine 
has been shown to help prevent pneumocystis infection 
advocates of the grassroots programs say the fda advisory 
committees action represents a major breakthrough for the concept 
of communitybased research and recognition that primarycare 
doctors can produce solid clinical data in the routine delivery of 
medical services to their patients 
the result they hope will be to help get effective therapies 
to aids victims faster community programs reach more people they 
say and so will be able to bring more aids patients into clinical 
trials and with more participation there will be more information 
with which to assess the effectiveness of drugs 
the concept has won the backing of many scientists drug 
companies and the federal government which is preparing to award 
6 million in grants to develop communitybased research programs 
throughout the country in addition to the federal money the 
american foundation for aids research in april gave 14 million to 
16 community organizations starting reseach programs 
dr burton lee a cancer researcher member of former president 
reagans aids commission and now president bushs personal 
physician avidly supports communitybased research as an 
extension of the work going on in university and government centers 
these programs he said are free of the inherent biases of 
academic studies to exclude the sickest patients a more 
representative sampling which community programs provide produces 
better results and without any slippage in quality since many 
academic researchers sit on the advisory boards of the community 
programs he said 
he credits aids activists for pointing out the weaknesses in 
traditional research the communities have stepped up to bat and 
they have tried to speed up the system they came up with a 
constructive idea and i think its a good one lee said 
he added i hope they communityresearch programs spread out 
into other diseases i think its an excellent model for testing 
cancer drugs diabetes drugs heart disease drugs and others 
martin delaney cofounder of project inform a san 
franciscobased aids education group was an early proponent of 
communitybased research and still supports it but he says the 
movement has been romanticized 
few clinical trials are being done by community groups other 
than those in new york and san francisco and most of the efforts 
are spearheaded by doctors not aids patients and so are not 
really the symbols of patient empowerment that advocates describe 
them to be he said 
its an important part of a broader puzzle delaney said 
i dont think its ever going to replace universitybased 
research and theres a limit to how big it can get because of the 
time it takes for doctors to participate 
one mistake aids activists have made is in equating research 
with treatment he said 
the more pressure we put on the research process as being a 
way for treatment the more we confound the research process and 
the politicians find it a nice easy way out instead of providing 
the money for health care delaney said 
yet the movement is generating overwhelming interest said 
lawrence deyton assistant director for community research at the 
national institute for allergy and infectious diseases 
when the government announced its 6 million program it got 
more than 700 requests for information about it deyton declined to 
say how many applied by the april deadline but a capitol hill 
source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said it was more 
than 60 
deyton estimated that as many as a dozen communitybased groups 
are now involved in clinical trials for aids therapies 
with more trials he said there would likely be more 
participation by hispanics blacks intravenous drug users and 
women who are now underrepresented in clinical testing

japans secondlargest opposition party elected a 
new chairman sunday to succeed the party leader who resigned in an 
influencepeddling scandal 
koshiro ishida the komeito partys new leader told members 
i will fight to make the komeito once more a party that is clean 
and trustworthy 
ishida 58 previously one of four party vice chairmen was 
elected to succeed junya yano who resigned last week when 
prosecutors began formal questioning of a komeito member of 
parliament 
katsuya ikeda of komeito and takeo fujinami of the governing 
liberal democratic party were interrogated by police last week 
they are suspected of taking bribes from recruit co an 
information and publishing conglomerate 
the socalled recruit scandal has resulted in 14 bureaucrats and 
businessmen being arrested on bribery and securities law violation 
charges 
prime minister noboru takeshita who has acknowledged receiving 
political contributions from recruit announced last month he was 
resigning to take responsibility for the scandal but his party has 
yet to find a successor who commands widespread respect and is 
untainted by the scandal 
yano himself was under fire in komeito the secondlargest 
opposition party after the socialists for links to an earlier 
insidertrading scandal 
more than 600 party members including 56 members of the 
512seat house of representatives and 23 members of the 252seat 
house of councilors attended the special party convention in 
downtown tokyo 
ishida urged fellow party members to reflect on a lack of 
seriousness among members of parliament the new party leaders 
he said must examine the scandal and reform the party 
i believe this is the way to win public confidence he said 
though as an opposition legislator ikeda had no official power 
he repeatedly lodged questions in parliament that prosecutors saw 
as helpful to recruit and he gained financial benefits from 
recruit share transactions 
recruit sold bargainpriced unlisted shares in a subsidiary to 
about 160 influential politicians aides bureaucrats and 
businessmen allegedly in an attempt to gain influence in the 
government when public trading in the shares began their prices 
soared and buyers made large profits 
ishida was first elected to the house of representatives in 1967

lloyd ricks helped assemble cars for 16 
years until he lost his job now hes helping former coworkers 
rebuild their lives 
weve all been kicked in the teeth said ricks 34 now 
its time to get up and go 
ricks was a chief steward at chrysler corp until the company 
ended car production in kenosha last december laying off more than 
5000 workers the kenosha factory complex obtained by chrysler as 
part of its 1987 purchase of american motors corp had been used 
for automaking for 86 years 
in his new job as a career counselor ricks is part of a network 
that is leading people to new jobs and trying to create employment 
opportunities 
some former workers say they realize the new jobs will pay far 
less than they earned at chrysler but they have to do something 
because unemployment benefits begin to evaporate in the next month 
people are starting to get a little more desperate said 
rick phillips 35 an exautoworker people were relaxed at first 
because we had such a good benefits package 
in addition to regular unemployment compensation the package 
included a 20 million job bank from chrysler that paid full 
salary to 2200 senior workers for about three months workers with 
less seniority drew money from a subpay fund that provided 
2400 to each person 
its soon going to get to the point where the shoe really 
starts pinching said jack ward director of the workers 
assistance center established at the local united auto workers 
headquarters 
more than 2000 former autoworkers have sought help at the 
assistance center and about 300 have landed new jobs so far ward 
said the center is staffed by other former chrysler employees who 
have been trained to be counselors 
the center has computer access to job openings in wisconsin and 
illinois it also guides people to training programs at a technical 
school and provides a workshop where people can improve their math 
and english skills 
karen gibson 42 said that after brushing up her education she 
hopes to get a civil service job she had a chance to go to a 
chrysler plant in belvidere ill along with about 200 other 
former kenosha autoworkers but she and her husband did not want to 
leave their home 
in the meantime gibson said she is coping with tight finances 
although she says her unemployment benefits will continue until 
around july 
we dont go out anymore she said we dont go out to a 
movie bowling or even a tavern 
some people have started showing signs of alcohol or domestic 
problems said said karen geiken who helps run a listening 
post at the uaw headquarters so laid off workers can receive 
emotional support 
chrysler is assisting in local economic development 
were not out of the picture said thomas foley a chrysler 
executive assigned to the effort he noted that chrysler is still 
kenoshas largest employer with about 1200 people working at the 
companys engine plant 
workers state and local officials expressed betrayal when 
chrysler announced the december shutdown in january 1988 saying 
they believed the company had promised to continue production into 
the 1990s the state even threatened to sue but accepted a 
settlement that included the creation of foleys position for one 
year 
chrysler also donated vacant buildings for office and 
manufacturing space and diverted profits from 1988 wisconsin car 
sales into a trust fund to help laid off workers with living 
expenses the fund totals more than 23 million 
the crisis part of it is over said kenosha county executive 
john collins who noted that officials prepared to deal with the 
shutdown before it occurred this was an unusual plant closing 
normally you dont know about it a year ahead of time

three candidates are running in virginias 
first republican gubernatorial primary in 40 years vying for the 
chance to oppose lt gov l douglas wilder in his bid to be the 
nations first elected black governor 
virginia republicans eager for victory after two straight 
shutouts for the statehouse hold a primary june 13 in hopes of 
stirring more voter interest than a convention would attract 
i dont see any signs that the gamble is paying off said 
mark j rozell a political science professor at mary washington 
college in fredericksburg 
the state party chairman disagrees 
i think were dominating the news said state republican 
chairman donald w huffman were getting noticed and thats 
what its all about the three candidates have held 11 public 
debates that have garnered statewide attention the last one 
wednesday 
on the democratic side wilder is unchallenged for the 
nomination with selection set for the party convention june 9 and 
10 by law democratic gov gerald l baliles cannot serve a second 
consecutive term 
the republican primary candidates are 
former state attorney general j marshall coleman 46 who 
lost to democrat charles robb in 1981 was squeezed out when he 
started talking about another bid for governor in 1985 and then 
sought but failed to get the nomination for lieutenant governor 
rep stanford e parris 59 is a former state legislator who 
touts his experience in state and federal office an unsuccessful 
contender for the gubernatorial nomination in 1985 he never has 
run in a statewide race 
former sen paul s trible jr 42 who did not seek 
reelection to his us senate seat last year trible is the 
frontrunner in the contest according to polls but his lead may 
be narrowing parris and coleman say trible gave up his seat rather 
than face robb who won in a landslide over a littleknown 
candidate 
all three stress the goals of boosting education and fighting 
drugs coleman has issued a blanket pledge not to raise taxes 
parris said he cant rule out any tax increase in four years 
trible has refused to make a notax pledge 
the polls show trible favored in a headtohead contest with 
wilder who won the states no 2 office in 1985 with 52 percent of 
the vote coleman is about even with wilder and parris trails the 
democrat 
republican national chairman lee atwater has made the virginia 
gubernatorial campaign a key test for the gop im going to come 
down here every week if i have to and do everything i can 
atwater said at a virginia beach fundraiser earlier this month 
president bush carried the state last year with 60 percent of 
the vote democrats have captured virginias electoral votes only 
twice since the end of world war ii in 1948 and 1964 
state republicans last tried a gubernatorial primary 40 years 
ago the most successful primaries for the gop have been those 
conducted by the opposition 
in 1969 a threeway democratic primary badly split the party 
and led to the election of virginias first republican governor 
since reconstruction linwood holton 
in 1977 another democratic primary set up a republican victory 
when former lt gov henry e howell staged an upset victory over 
attorney general andrew p miller in june howell lost that fall to 
republican john n dalton 
after 1977 the democrats stopped holding primaries and started 
winning elections in 1981 with charles s robb and 1985 with 
gerald l baliles 
when the democrats quit the primary a democrat got elected 
rozell said i think theres a connection there

tom brokaw admitted he 
was in the position of a huckleberry in the path of a hungry 
grizzly 
but the nbctv news anchor went ahead anyway and defended news 
coverage of last summers yellowstone fires to a group of park 
activists 
as trying as it was i am confident the daily news readers and 
viewers had an accurate view of the fires brokaw said saturday 
of the flames that raged over nearly half of yellowstones 22 
million acres 
brokaws speech came near the end of the twoday conference of 
the greater yellowstone coalition during which nearly every 
speaker complained that the news media gave the impression that the 
countrys first national park was destroyed by the flames 
taken one at a time some stories may be flawed brokaw 
conceded but no american news reader or watcher makes a judgment 
based on one story news as we consume it is a steady diet

the massachusetts flag now flutters 
over a former boarding school seized last week by state officials 
who plan to make it a prison 
but on trees nearby are tacked homemade signs depicting a cow in 
prison stripes and one word never and there is still talk at 
the general store of stopping the state from building a 500inmate 
mediumsecurity prison in this isolated town of 800 people and more 
than twice as many dairy cows 
it all started in 1983 when the pioneer valley academy shut its 
doors and state officials decided to turn the building into a 
prison for drunken drivers the project didnt go through and the 
prison was built instead in springfield 40 miles away but that 
wasnt the end of the story 
they came back with the regular prison said dorothea 
thomasvitrac chairwoman of the town board of selectmen 
to the state the former seventh day adventist boarding school 
perched on a windswept ridge is a place to build a badly needed 
prison without having to start from scratch 
the 240bed first phase of the prison which the state hopes to 
complete in 18 months is expected to cost about 256 million 
including renovations at the school said louise pepe spokeswoman 
for the state division of capitol planning 
the second construction phase is expected to cost 204 million 
pepe said 
for the townspeople its a battle to preserve the rural way of 
life in this little onestore hamlet where the road in front of 
town hall is blocked for 20 minutes twice a day while a farming 
family moves its cows to and from the barn for milking 
its the sort of place where the main road is a country lane 
squeezed between stone fences marking pastures that were cleared 
when the nation was young where the town crew waits for the snow 
to stop before plowing even if it takes days 
we dont sit down and strategize how we are going to convince 
people we will be good neighbors but we will be talking with 
them said deodato arruda a spokesman for the state department 
of corrections 
she said eight armed corrections officers would be stationed at 
the prison around the clock 
but susan reed coowner of the general store and president of a 
citizens group fighting the prison said the locals will not be won 
over 
i dont think there is any chance of that happening she 
said they havent dealt with us fairly at any time in the past 
three years 
the town appropriated 100000 last year onefifth its budget 
to fight the prison two lawsuits challenging the siteselection 
process are pending in the courts 
the owners of the school property also are fighting back 
promising to challenge the eminentdomain process by which the 
state seized the property they say the 525 million pricetag the 
state has placed on the 730acre property is not nearly enough 
walpole real estate developer daniel e stiar bought the academy 
with newton psychiatrist gary jacobsen in 1985 for 32 million 
the men had hopes of turning it into a psychiatric hospital but a 
year later they offered it to the state for 10 million 
i wish i had never bought the property its been a lot of 
aggravation he said 
the state inspector general blasted the states handling of the 
matter in a report he suggested that bumbling alone delayed the 
prison at least 18 months and in some cases exacerbated the 
controversy 
inspector general joseph baressi said an environmental study 
that was to have cost 75000 ended up costing 645000 the town 
has charged in a lawsuit that the report did not adequately address 
environmental issues

the government on sunday said it is 
still dissatisfied with a us plan for solving a nato rift over 
whether to hold superpower talks on shortrange nuclear missiles 
but government spokesman hans klein told reporters that west 
germany was confident the issue can be resolved before a may 29 
nato summit in brussels 
referring to the us compromise proposal brought back by 
defense minister gerhard stoltenberg after a visit friday to 
washington klein said i think it forms the basis for a 
solution but a solution has not yet been found 
the discussions are continuing klein said 
he declined comment on what obstacles remained 
klein said that chancellor helmut kohl would send president bush 
a letter detailing the governments position on monday and that 
kohl would call bush and other nato leaders to discuss the matter 
in coming days 
klein briefed reporters after kohl met for two hours with 
stoltenberg and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
west germany has been pressing for prompt superpower talks on 
the missiles the bush administration orginally had flatly rejected 
such talks 
the disagreement has caused nato members to choose sides in the 
dispute and clouded plans for the nato summit 
under the us compromise plan negotiations on shortrange 
nuclear weapons would be linked at some indefinite point to talks 
now under way in vienna designed to reduce conventional forces 
such as tanks 
the shortrange talks would not be held until the sovietled 
warsaw pact agreed to sizable reductions in its conventional 
forces which washington says far outnumber nato forces 
acceptance of shortrange negotiations at all represents a major 
concession by bush for months us officials had ruled out any 
negotiations on the missiles saying they were essential to the 
defense of western europe 
in return the us wants west germany to relent in its demands 
for speedy negotiations and state firmly that it rejects the 
immediate elimination of shortrange weapons 
government sources in bonn who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the obstacles to agreement centered on the latter provision 
the socalled third zero option under which shortrange 
missiles would be immediately scrapped 
us secretary of state james a baker iii said the us 
counterproposal also envisioned postponing until 1992 a decision on 
deployment and production of missiles that are faster and travel 
farther than the lance missiles 
amid a wave of disarmament feeling in west germany bonn has 
resisted a plan to upgrade the usmade lance missiles deployed in 
west germany against the sovietled forces 
kohl wants to delay any decision to deploy the new missiles 
until at least 1992 after next years national elections 
all major west german political parties are united in the demand 
for negotiations out of concern their country is the likeliest 
battlefield in the event of a nuclear war in europe

a federal judge is expected to rule soon on 
efforts of researchers to gain access to computer tapes that could 
shed new light on the irancontra affair and other backstage 
dealings in the reagan white house 
us district judge charles r richey has asked for written 
arguments by thursday on whether some decisions by president bush 
to block access to the tapes are subject to court review 
the government is asking for a summary judgment that would in 
effect dismiss the claims of the national security archive and 
others for access to the computer messages 
the national security archive is a private repository of 
government information operated as a division of the fund for 
peace a new york nonprofit organization 
other plaintiffs include the american historical association and 
american library association they say the tapes contain 
information that does not exist anywhere in paper form 
at issue in the case are backup tapes containing messages sent 
on the professional office system known as profs in the national 
security council and other agencies in the executive office of the 
president 
printouts from the tapes were used by the presidentially 
appointed tower commission and the congressional irancontra 
committees in their investigations of the affair that rocked 
president reagans second term they were also introduced as 
evidence in the trial of oliver north who was convicted of aiding 
and abetting in the obstruction of congress shredding and altering 
documents and accepting a gratuity 
the plaintiffs say there are more 144 tapes in a system used by 
100 to 150 people on the nsc staff and 32 in a system used by more 
than 300 in the executive office of the president and that such 
messages are routinely destroyed 
the fundamental issue in this case is whether the nsc and the 
eop may authorize the routine destruction of information generated 
on the profs computer systems without complying with the 
requirements of the federal records laws attorney katherine a 
meyer of public citizen litigation group representing the 
plaintiffs told the judge in a memorandum 
plaintiffs argument confuses the medium with the message 
justice department attorneys replied profs is simply a tool for 
conveying information 
the government takes the position that the system is a 
substitute for calling a colleague on the telephone or talking with 
him or her in a hallway 
the justice department told the court that the bulk of the 
information generated on that system is transitory and does not 
constitute record material it said users of the system have been 
instructed repeatedly to make a printout of any information that 
legally amounts to a government record 
ms meyer on the other hand argued that the nsc and executive 
office have made a blanket determination that except in rare 
instances the information generated on the profs systems is simply 
not covered by any of the federal records laws 
if the judge denies the governments motion for summary 
judgment ms meyer said the plaintiffs will file a motion to 
obtain additional information they need in order to show that the 
defendants have violated those laws by routinely deleting and 
ultimately deciding to destroy the information that existed on the 
profs system at the end of the reagan administration 
defendants in the case include bush and donald wilson the 
archivist of the united states who the plaintiffs accuse of 
failing to exercise proper oversight of the nscs and eops 
routine destruction of information generated on the profs system

american television networks continued to report 
from beijing over the weekend but in most cases without that 
important component of television coverage pictures 
were now on the basis of handcarrying everything out said 
cbs dan rather who left for tokyo after the networks live 
coverage was shut down friday night in the middle of the season 
finale of dallas 
what videotape the networks were obtaining was filmed illegally 
under martial law and correspondents were reduced to giving live 
reports by telephone tension was increasing sunday as troops were 
rumored to be readying a move on the protesters 
theres no question that were handcuffed by not being able to 
broadcast live said cnn anchor bernard shaw in a telephone 
interview from beijing where he remained on sunday the 
government can pull the plug on cnn to keep the story from getting 
to the world but we are not their problem if they dont pull 
the telephone plugs and i expect them to do that well be able to 
get word out 
network television coverage had for days brought americans 
inspiring pictures of the remarkable uprising on friday the 
government got fed up and ordered coverage to cease the networks 
broke in live to cover that development abc even taking its 
cameras into cnns control room in beijing dallas viewers got 
an unexpected reallife cliffhanger when cbs news broke in with 
scenes of rather attempting to negotiate with chinese officials 
i do protest in the most respectful manner rather said to no 
avail he reluctantly signed off one last time as a technician in 
the background shut off the satellite dish 
i loved the fella who called in and said i was watching dan 
rather and dallas broke in rather joked in a telephone 
interview from tokyo on saturday 
there were some calls of complaint from dallas viewers but 
taking to the air was a matter of being able to broadcast the most 
recent cbs news footage dramatic scenes of demonstrators being 
beaten by police 
the object became to delay it as long as we possibly could 
rather said of the halt in coverage china is a society where 
authority is everything thats why i kept asking for something in 
writing 
rathers coverage from tiananmen square had been shut down 
earlier as he rushed back to the hotel lane venardos director of 
special events was on the air arguing in a hotel corridor with two 
uncomfortablelooking chinese officials 
the scene in the control room and in the hallway was just 
bizarre i was stalling to get fed everything we had coming in to 
us said venardos also in tokyo on saturday i was using every 
ploy i could including getting them to put it in writing i knew 
he rather was on his way back 
rather said the breakneck ride back to the hotel included a 
collision with one of the many bicycles clogging the street but no 
one was hurt 
meanwhile at cnn shaw went on live as executive producer alec 
miran vainly negotiated with chinese officials 
i certainly was angry shaw recalled i tried not to show 
that on the air my object was to disgorge the last information we 
have but to have your pencil your notepad your microphone and 
your camera snatched out of your hands is very disturbing 
there was frustration but also a sense of i dont know if 
prides the right word but just knowing that what youre doing is 
right said miran also still in beijing there were very mixed 
emotions because on one hand you want to stand up and scream 
about freedom of the press on the other hand that doesnt mean 
anything here 
when his arguments at one point had flustered a chinese 
official miran recalled he said this is china in his mind 
that explained everything

the technique invented by steptoe and his partner robert 
edwards involves removing the egg from the mothers ovary 
fertilizing it with sperm in a dish and returning the egg to the 
womb to grow into a normal embryo 
for women who could not conceive because of such afflictions as 
blocked fallopian tubes ivf was their salvation but it remains 
difficult painful and expensive and only some 10000 babies 
worldwide have been born by ivf 
so many of you suffered pain anxiety stress tension and 
then fortunately all of you had joy and happiness brinsden told 
the parents gathered outside the clinic 
so it was worthwhile for you he said but id like you 
just to bear in mind that for every one of you there are seven or 
eight or nine others who have not been as fortunate as you so let 
us think today also of the people who have not been as lucky 
among the children enjoying the jugglers brass band and punch 
and judy show was greeces first testtube child christine 
iordanidou 7 
standing with christine and her parents was another greek 
couple dimitri and diamanto marsellos and their 4yearold 
testtube son john 
mrs marsellos said she had only one fallopian tube and it was 
blocked the couple visited american doctors who told her nothing 
could be done then after hearing about christine iordanidou on 
television they visited steptoe and edwards 
dr steptoe accepted us said marsellos i said all over 
the world we were told there was no hope what makes you so sure 
you can help and dr steptoe said something i will never forget 
he said your case is one of the most difficult cases and we 
accept difficult cases 
louise brown has entered her preteens thoroughly at ease with 
fame wearing a pink dress and white ribbon in her long golden 
hair she faced the cameras patiently while her parents fielded 
reporters questions 
i think the partys absolutely marvelous i never thought when 
louise was born that we would one day see so many children its 
lovely said louises mother leslie 41 
louises father john a 48yearold truck driver said the 
couple often receives letters from parents of testtube children 
asking whether such children need anything special for their 
upbringing 
we just say do the natural thing bring up the children 
brown said 
the browns have a second testtube daughter 6yearold natalie 
steptoe died last year but edwards was at the party and used 
the opportunity to deliver an impassioned appeal for more research 
and financing for techniques of assisted conception 
when you think that maybe one couple in 10 is infertile weve 
got a lot of work to do he said

a former press secretary to jesse jackson 
contends in a new book that the 1988 presidential candidate was an 
abusive and sexist boss who was incessantly critical and totally 
egocentric 
elizabeth o colton who served as jacksons press secretary for 
about two months in early 1988 describes being shoved from behind 
by jackson and says the candidate literally stepped on her toes to 
show his displeasure on several occasions 
he abused me and most other staff members in countless ways 
she writes 
coltons account of jacksons unsuccessful campaign for the 1988 
democratic presidential nomination is the jackson phenomenon the 
man the power the message being published june 26 by doubleday 
jackson declined to comment on her descriptions of him or 
incidents colton recounts saying he had not read the book 
but jackson in an interview disputed the notion colton was a 
campaign insider he said she worked as his traveling press 
secretary for only five weeks and left about the time of the 
super tuesday round of southern primaries 
liz was with us for about five weeks jackson said some 
of that time she spent moving to washington and then she got sick 
and she left around or before super tuesday when our campaign 
was just really getting started 
i dont know why i should either read or react to that he 
said 
asked if he wanted to read the book jackson replied its not 
a priority 
colton in an interview said jackson was totally wrong 
about her length of service and said her illness was only a brief 
flu she said in the book that she worked as press secretary from 
jan 24 until march 28 when she was informed jackson no longer 
wanted her on the road with the campaign she became a consultant 
to the campaign on april 4 and remained until midjune 
she said she was relieved by the move and much of her book is 
devoted to descriptions of jackson delivering constant 
unwarranted abuse to her and other staffers sometimes in public 
the reality for me was that it was very unpleasant to be 
around someone who was incessantly critical and totally egocentric 
to the extent that no one else mattered at all she writes 
it was also frightening i knew it would become very difficult 
for me to defend my position as this mans press secretary at 
first i believed in him i still believed in most of his issues 
but i could no longer throw my heart behind the man as i had at the 
beginning 
she said she believed her personality irritated jackson but 
that jacksons treatment of women did not match his public support 
for womens rights female staff members she wrote were fully 
aware that they were treated as secondclass citizens by jackson 
she describes entering a news conference following a debate with 
other democratic candidates in atlanta and says jackson first 
asked her to check on the scene then pushed her when he saw 
television cameras on other candidates 
as i began walking in to check the scene to report back to 
him i suddenly felt my breath being knocked out of me from behind 
it was jesses fist smashing into my back he was pushing me aside 
and snarling in my ear get the out of my way she wrote 
she said jackson deliberately stepped on her feet as she talked 
to reporters aboard the campaign jet 
he stepped squarely on my feet and it hurt she wrote i 
was so shocked that i figured it must have been an accident but 
several more times convinced me sadly that hed done it on 
purpose to signal me to quit talking 
yolanda carraway who directed jacksons washington office said 
in an interview that colton frequently dropped off jacksons 
traveling party for personal reasons and was given a 
washingtonbased job that allowed her to begin writing her book 
while still on the campaign payroll she said colton never came 
into the washington campaign office

president bush faces a last chance 
opportunity to reform pentagon procurement according to two 
congressmen who recommend reinforcing the authority of an 
acquisition czar and simplification of current regulations 
reps les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee and nicholas mavroules dmass chairman of the panels 
subcommittee on investigations also suggested a system of rational 
tradeoffs between military requirements cost and performance and 
training for procurement personnel without reliance on outside 
consultants 
if reform is to occur the implementation must be specific and 
measured and not simply the expression of a philosophical 
statement the congressmen said in a fourpage letter to bush 
defense secretary dick cheney will be submitting to the 
president sometime soon a defense management review which will 
include proposals based on the 1986 packard commission report the 
lawmakers said 
the packard commission studied ways to reform the pentagons 
system of buying weapons 
aspin and mavroules proposed a checklist of critical actions 
for bush to consider including clarifying the authority of the 
undersecretary of defense for acquisition and establishing a better 
relationship between the defense resources board the defense 
acquisition board and the joint requirements operational committee 
an improved relationship of the three organizations which 
oversee the defense budget acquisition and requirements would 
result in checks and balances that will promote the planning 
scheduling and budgeting that produces tradeoffs 
for those of us who have worked on this issue the last three 
years attempting to create a cultural change within the 
department of defense this current effort to make acquisition 
reform work is a last chance opportunity the congressmen said 
last summer allegations of fraud and corruption in the 
procurement process rocked the pentagon

jury selection was scheduled to begin 
monday for the trial of us rep donald lukens on a misdemeanor 
charge of having sex with a 16yearold girl 
if convicted the 58yearold republican could go to jail for up 
to six months also weighing in the balance is the political future 
of the fourterm congressman who has survived other allegations 
during his career 
five days before the start of the trial a 35yearold sexual 
molestation case involving lukens was brought to light by a detroit 
television station 
wjbk reported that lukens then a salesman was taken in for 
questioning in michigan in 1954 on suspicion he had sexually 
molested a young girl the station citing unidentified police 
sources said the case was dropped because the childs parents 
refused to press charges 
lukens declined comment on the detroit report other than to say 
there was no case 
he also wouldnt talk about the trial saying the details will 
be used in his defense he has said he is innocent 
hes going to let it work out in the proper forum and that is 
a court of law said william jarrell lukens spokesman in 
washington 
rita mangini the assistant franklin county prosecutor who is 
handling the case expects the trial to last no more than a week 
the case drew national attention when a columbus television 
station on feb 1 broadcast a secretly recorded videotape that 
showed lukens apparently offering a government job to the mother of 
the 16yearold after she asked him why he was messing around 
with her daughter wsyx said it recorded the nov 11 1988 meeting 
at a fastfood restaurant a day after anna coffman approaced the 
station with her story 
lukens told ms coffman who wore a concealed microphone that 
he thought her daughter was an adult according to the videotape 
the fbi reviewed the tape and said it found no evidence of 
bribery or extortion 
lukens was indicted feb 23 on a charge of contributing to the 
unruliness and delinquency of a child the misdemeanor charge 
stemmed from the allegation that lukens who is divorced had sex 
with the girl in his columbus apartment last year 
the charge carries a maximum sentence of 180 days in jail and a 
1000 fine 
lukens refused to discuss the accusations against him for three 
weeks following the first reports of the allegations he made his 
first public comment on the day of the indictment issuing a 
statement proclaiming his innocence 
he has vowed to serve out his term which expires in 1990 
several republicans have indicated an interest in lukens seat 
should the political opportunity arise 
lukens has raised about 20000 for his defense which jarrell 
said is expected to cost about 60000 one event in washington 
produced 10000 
lukens was first elected to congress in 1966 and served two 
terms before he was barred from seeking public office for five 
years for not filing campaign reports on time that election law 
was changed before the fiveyear period expired and he was 
appointed to the state senate in 1971 to fill an unexpired term 
in 1974 while in the state senate he fought allegations that 
he accepted 1000 in campaign contributions from korean 
businessman tongsun park during his first stint on capitol hill he 
denied the charge presenting the results of a voluntary lie 
detector test 
he returned to congress in 1986 and was reelected last november 
in 1984 lukens was stricken with throat cancer he has 
undergone six operations radiation therapy and treatment with an 
experimental drug that left him with a raspy voice and a 
chronically dry mouth he said the cancer is in remission

the 17monthold palestinian uprising in the 
occupied territories appears to be at a crossroads with both 
palestinians and israelis threatening to escalate the use of force 
in their latest leaflet palestinian underground leaders vowed 
to kill an israeli soldier or settler for every arab killed by 
israeli troops 
israels army is on the offensive against palestinian unrest 
killing 33 arabs and wounding 435 so far this month the government 
also has increased economic pressure putting the gaza strips 
700000 palestinians under curfew for eight days and requiring 
permits to work in israel 
palestinian leaders have so far persuaded protesters to use just 
bottles and stones in clashes with israeli troops but with 496 
arabs killed since the uprising began in december 1987 palestinian 
intellectuals say there is growing pressure to use guns 
the ground is shaking under those who urge restraint said a 
prominent palestinian he spoke on condition of anonymity saying 
he feared arrest if he spoke openly 
there is a feeling among some young activists that the only 
way to make the americans force israel to make policy changes is 
for israel to pay a higher cost to send israelis back in 
coffins he said 
concurrently there is growing pressure from israeli 
rightwingers led by prime minister yitzhak shamir to use 
whatever force is necessary to crush the violent protests 
how far israel would actually go in using military force remains 
to be seen but one official said israel needs to widen the 
battlefield and use administrative violence to hit arabs in the 
pocketbook and other aspects of daytoday life 
we need to fight in all fields of life not just the 
streets he said 
such action the official said would persuade palestinians to 
adopt a more realistic view of possible political settlements and 
give up militant nationalist aspirations 
the crackdown on palestinian workers is especially severe since 
wages from israel which were 700 million in 1987 accounted for 
about onethird of the occupied territories gross national 
product about 50000 of the 700000 palestinians from the gaza 
strip and 60000 of the 1 million west bank residents work in 
israel 
on the palestinian side there have been several signs of 
escalating violence 
on friday for the first time there was a gun battle between 
troops and armed palestinians one soldier died and three arabs 
were killed palestinians also have stepped up killings of 
suspected army collaborators 
plo chairman yasser arafat told reporters in baghdad iraq that 
palestinians may be forced to use arms if israeli forces continue 
to kill arab demonstrators 
and in an interview with the kuwaiti daily al watan mohammed 
abbas a leading plo figure called for the use of firearms we 
are convinced that diplomacy has a time and the stone has a time 
but i see that the time nas now come to use arms in support of the 
intefadeh he was quoted as saying 
but there are questions whether palestinians would use arms or 
whether such threats are rhetoric to make israel back away from 
hardline policies 
arieh shalev a retired general and west bank military governor 
in 197476 said palestinians lack adequate weapons to mount an 
effective guerrilla war he said palestinians risk harsh israeli 
reprisals if they fight with firearms 
palestinian moderates have expressed concern the plo would 
abandon the policy of unarmed resistance and risk losing 
international backing 
i am against escalation on our side i think we should try to 
keep the intefadeh bloodless said ziad abu ziad a palestinian 
activist who edits the biweekly hebrewlanguage newsletter gesher 
or bridge aimed at an israeli audience 
but he said palestinian anger is rising over the lack of israeli 
response to demands for an end to the occupation the number of 
protesters killed and wounded and collective punishments such as 
curfews and work restrictions 
these measures are responsible for any escalation that occurs 
on the palestinian side he said 
faisal husseini who heads a palestinian study center in 
jerusalem said israel is at a crossroads the government must 
decide whether to accept palestinian demands for statehood or 
continue with a policy of confrontation 
the situation is more dangerous now people are so angry he 
said

britain ordered eight soviet diplomats and three 
journalists out of the country for alleged espionage and the 
soviet union responded with an identical set of expulsions the 
british embassy said sunday 
its a mirrorimage act of retaliation sir rodric q 
braithwaite britains ambassador to moscow told a news conference 
britain said its expulsions were legitimate and that the soviet 
response was unjustified the soviet union had no immediate comment 
on either set of expulsions 
on friday soviet ambassador leonid zamyatin was called to the 
british foreign office in london and told that 11 soviets were 
being expelled for activities incompatible with their status a 
foreign office spokesman said 
the spokesman would not detail the specific allegations but 
incompatible activities is diplomatic parlance for espionage 
the foreign office spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping 
with british custom said britain had not planned to make public 
the expulsions and did so only after the soviets retaliated 
on saturday night braithwaite was summoned to the soviet 
foreign ministry and told that 11 britons were being expelled the 
british embassys political counselor roderic lyne said 
in each case eight diplomats and three journalists were 
expelled lyne said each group was given 14 days to leave the 
country 
in london sir geoffrey howe britains foreign minister called 
britains action a measured action in respect of established 
misbehavior and termed the soviet response unjustified howe said 
britain has incontrovertible evidence of wrongdoing by the 
expelled soviets 
he also urged the soviet union to cease an alleged buildup of 
intelligence gathering in britain saying that was an area excluded 
from the general improvement in relations between the countries 
britains independent television news radio reported the soviets 
were caught spying on military installations the soviets were not 
identified 
the britons ordered out included embassy second secretary 
michael anderson second secretary adam noble third secretary paul 
sharp vice consul helen pickering naval attache capt christopher 
meyer assistant naval attache lt cmdr christopher watson 
assistant military attache maj nigel shakespear and warrant 
officer laing purfit of the defense ministry staff 
jeremy harris of the british broadcasting corp ian 
gloverjames of independent television news and angus roxburgh of 
the sunday times of london also were given two weeks to leave the 
soviet union lyne said 
roxburgh said he and the other british journalists were told by 
braithwaite that the kremlin had ordered them and the diplomats to 
leave because we had engaged in impermissible activities 
needless to say i find the accusation ludicrous almost too 
silly to comment on roxburgh said 
bbcs deputy directorgeneral john birt said the bbc would 
vigorously resist harris expulsion 
gloverjames said in a telephone interview that he and the other 
britons were accused of impermissible activity on the territory 
of the soviet union 
im not guilty of any spying lawbreaking or any impermissible 
activity he said 
britain also declared on friday that three former soviet embassy 
workers who already have completed their tours were not welcome 
back lyne said the soviets responded by declaring three former 
british embassy staff members persona non grata he said 
asked why the british government kept its expulsions quiet the 
foreign office spokesman said we look at these on a casebycase 
basis and in this case we decided not to initiate publicity but 
obviously once they the soviets retaliated it just broke 
but george robertson a spokesman for the opposition labor 
party said britains conservative government had kept a bizarre 
and inexplicable silence and added the british public deserve 
a lot more information before they will accept that this is 
justified

a threetime national scalemodel champion johnson now competes 
with a radiocontrolled model of a b26 bomber like those he flew 
in 65 combat missions over europe in world war ii 
it took five years to build has a ninefoot wingspan and is 
powered by two fourcycle engines the radio controls operate the 
throttle rudder and aileron turn on landing lights open bomb bay 
doors and release replica bombs 
the witch flies with the help of a section of black umbrella 
that serves as an airfoil sort of like a hang glider 
snoopys doghouse uses the overhanging edges of the roof as 
wings 
theres a personal accomplishment and satisfaction of flying 
something youve built said johnson 69 
but its not as easy as it looks i could teach someone to fly 
a fullsized aircraft easier than a model he said

having two heads of state for commencement 
speakers might seem inspirational to many graduating seniors 
but the presence of president bush and frances president 
francois mitterrand at boston universitys 116th commencement 
sunday dampened the spirits of some of the 5400 graduates and 
their friends 
it means no booze no beach balls no fun said ron kleiman 
24 a recent bu graduate who yelled to his graduating friends as 
they walked to their seats 
we had to throw away the champagne bottles said graduating 
senior dave wheeler 21 who received a degree in political 
science but i guess it is worth the tradeoff if it means having 
the president here 
but if some students were ambivalent about the extraordinary 
pomp and circumstance surrounding their graduation many of the 
more than 30000 alumni friends and relatives in the packed 
audience were thrilled 
some like saul holtzman 72 a member of the class of 1939 
came from as far away as albuquerque nm for the ceremony 
its great really exciting said holtzman sitting with 
other members of the 50th reunion class its a lot different 
from 50 years ago republican presidential candidate alf landon 
was our speaker then 
adel anbar 23 said his parents traveled from the small persian 
gulf nation of qatar for his graduation when they heard that bush 
and mitterrand were the featured speakers 
it was a good reason for my parents to come said anbar 
bush and mitterrand and their wives barbara bush and danielle 
mitterrand were welcomed with applause and cheers 
the heartiest and most surprising reception was reserved for 
gov michael s dukakis who since his failed presidential 
campaign has been under siege locally for the states fiscal 
crisis 
some of the students wore peace symbols on their gowns and the 
words bush knew on their mortar boards a few held up protest 
signs when bush began his address 
im wearing this because bush knew about the contras but went 
ahead and made oliver north the scapegoat said claire connelly 
22 a graduating senior from south boston its an imperialist 
presidency and bush shouldnt be there 
another group of demonstrators handed out leaflets outside the 
stadium protesting the policies of the bush administration 
but most of the students a number of them holding tiny french 
and american flags said they were pleased with the commencement 
they often interrupted mitterrands speech cheering his 
exhortations for environmental protection when he said the earth 
is our planet let us save it 
were pretty glad to have bush here said graduating senior 
joe curley 22 were in this with our eyes open we cant argue 
too much about the world we are going out into 
were all pretty bourgeois said his friend dave wheeler 
who is going on to law school 
another graduating senior mary hansel 22 from rochester 
ny said some in her class feared that bush and mitterrand would 
overshadow them 
but mostly it is exciting most people cant believe we are 
here she said

washington state politics were rocked last 
september when a young woman alleged that sen brock adams had 
invited her to his home drugged her and sexually assaulted her 
eight months later no criminal charges or lawsuits have been 
filed adams goes on with his legislative work in washington dc 
the democratic senator has repeatedly denied the allegations 
made by kari tupper of seattle who said the incident occurred in 
march 1987 when she was a secretary on capitol hill adams who 
served as transportation secretary under president jimmy carter 
accused tupper of demanding 400000 in hush money from him 
law enforcement authorities said charges were never filed 
against adams because there was a of lack of evidence threats of 
lawsuits were tossed back and forth between adams and the tupper 
family who had been old friends of the senator 
i discussed the case with my attorney and it is very 
difficult for a public official who has been a victim of false 
statements to take legal action adams said thursday in a brief 
telephone interview from washington dc i have put the matter 
behind me and am moving forward to do my job in the senate 
adams would not comment on whether the case would affect his 
decision on whether to run for reelection in 1992 
i have just put this whole thing behind me and thats all i 
have to say i suggest others do the same he said 
kari tupper now 26 married and a graduate student in english 
at the university of washington did not return messages relayed 
through her mother and on her husbands answering machine at work 
her mother sylvia tupper who once dated adams said the case 
was on hold and would not discuss it in detail 
certain things are being tracked down mrs tupper said 
the thing is not dead thats all i can tell you 
karen marchioro chair of the state democrats said she did not 
see that the case had affected adams politically 
i think hes doing a good job she said the only people i 
ever hear mention this are press people

in october he lost in his attempt to be tried 
and acquitted of 10 federal counts of perjury before election day 
in november he lost his seat in congress 
monday brings former rep pat swindalls longawaited day in 
court barring a lastminute delay 
the defense has sought to move the trial out of atlanta because 
of publicity but us district judge richard freeman has deferred 
any ruling on that request until he tries to seat an impartial jury 
in atlanta 
the trial is crucial to the 38yearold evangelical 
conservatives political future the twoterm republican has 
maintained a political organization and says he would like to run 
against us sen sam nunn dga in 1992 if he is acquitted 
swindall was indicted oct 17 on 10 counts each of which 
carries a penalty of 10 months to five years in prison 
the indictment accuses swindall of lying under oath in early 
1988 to a federal grand jury investigating his dealings with an 
associate later convicted of money laundering and with a federal 
undercover agent posing as a money broker for probable drug dealers 
swindall running for reelection waived his right to file 
pretrial motions last october and asked that the case be tried 
immediately with the congressman acting as his own attorney 
prosecutors agreed and the trial began two weeks before election 
day 
but us district judge robert vining stopped the trial after 
swindall campaign mailings proclaiming his innocence arrived at 
the homes of at least two jurors thirteen days later on nov 8 
swindall lost his 4th district seat in atlantas eastern suburbs 
to democrat ben jones after a campaign marked by mudslinging on 
both sides 
in the indictment swindall is accused of lying about his 
meetings with two men charles lechasney an associate and admitted 
money launderer and mike martinez actually mike mullaney a 
federal agent posing as a money broker 
tapes of the encounters leaked to the news media last year 
show swindall who was seeking an 850000 loan to help pay for his 
luxurious stone mountain home being told by martinez that the 
money probably was connected with drugs and might pose problems for 
the congressman 
swindall told the agent that if the money came to him through 
lechasneys company it becomes charles problem 
the indictment contends that swindall lied in concealing from 
the grand jury his discussions on how the tracks of the money would 
be covered to protect him 
swindall also told the grand jury that he never chose to 
borrow the money although he acknowledged receiving a 150000 
check from lechasney 
swindall who conducted an animated defense in court last fall 
has been represented in pretrial motions this time by attorney 
richard hendrix a former federal prosecutor 
the former congressman has kept a low profile in the weeks 
preceding the trial he did host a party for some 200 supporters at 
his home which is up for sale earlier this month standing on 
his diving board he urged them to pray that justice will be 
served

workers were still working sunday to stop 
a small leak of radioactive water at the pilgrim nuclear power 
plant a spokeswoman said 
the leak was identified early in the week and the first repair 
plan was dropped said spokeswoman elaine robinson they had 
originally planned to use a gasket to seal the leak but later 
decided it needed welding we will not restart until the leak has 
been repaired 
the leak was one of two incidents cited in a letter by gov 
michael s dukakis and attorney general james shannon to the 
nuclear regulatory commission on friday calling for a suspension 
of the plants license to operate 
robinson said the leak was minor and posed no threat to the 
public 
its really more of a drip with only about 30 to 40 drips per 
minute she said likening the problem to a leaking bathroom 
faucet 
the leak was detected last monday in a water cleanup system 
located in the plants reactor building but does not directly 
affect the reactor 
in a separate incident thursday night the reactors protection 
systems were unintentionally activated when an operator threw a 
control switch prematurely 
dukakis and shannon are among many officials who have cited 
problems at the plant since it was authorized to begin a gradual 
restart in december more than two years after equipment and 
management troubles shut down the facility

money supply is largely unimportant in determining demand hicks 
was was a pioneer in streamlining the general economic equilibrium 
theory which explained the determination of prices and allocation 
of resources in an economy

the nobel memorial prize in economic science in 1972 sharing it 
with kenneth arrow of harvard university the prize was established

president bush said sunday he was prepared to 
defend his press secretarys description of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev as a drugstore cowboy a slang term 
suggesting a phony 
however french president francois mitterrand appearing at a 
joint news conference with bush rejected the characterization made 
last week by presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
the press spokesman had used the term drugstore cowboy in 
saying that a rash of disarmament offers from gorbachev were just 
part of a public relations campaign 
i think that one must be wary of caricatures mitterrand 
said mr gorbachev is worth very much more than that 
bush then said so much for marlin in fairness to the man 
 
at that point fitzwater standing next to the stage said 
no dont defend me 
the president responded no dont defend you which i would 
be perfectly prepared to do 
the questioning then turned to another subject

hugh c thompson jr blinks away tears 
when he remembers the first child he rescued from the my lai 
massacre pulled from a ditch she was covered with the blood of 
the women old men and children who filled it 
i had a child about that size the former army helicopter 
pilot said 
thompson has broken a long silence about the events of march 16 
1968 when us soldiers killed more than 400 civilians in a 
vietnamese hamlet 
the 23yearold warrant officer and his crews were the only 
soldiers at my lai to rescue rather than kill they saved the 
little girl who was about 4 or 5 years old and a group of 12 to 
16 old men women and children 
thompson now an oil field helicopter pilot and a parttime real 
estate agent rarely talks about the massacre because of the 
memories 
he testified at an army inquiry in 1970 but wouldnt talk to 
reporters until tv producer michael bilton made a second request 
for an interview backing it up with a sample of his work 
thompson said the quality of that work persuaded him to talk to 
bilton whose documentary on my lai airs tuesday on the public 
broadcasting system show frontline 
others who testified at the army inquiry said soldiers wanted 
revenge for buddies killed at my lai a desolate cluster of rural 
villages said to be a viet cong stronghold 
they were supposed to go through and kill off the enemy 
thompson told the daily advertiser of lafayette theres only one 
problem there werent any enemy 
the inexperienced soldiers led by lt william calley jr left 
their base at 722 am on march 16 1968 
they went in with blood in their eyes and shot everything that 
moved thompson said 
thompsons mission was to look for enemy fire and tell his 
gunship escorts where it was coming from but as his helicopter 
darted over the trees he couldnt see any shooting 
the routine reconnaissance turned into a nightmare 
he and his men flew over a ditch full of bodies old men old 
women and babies there were no young men nobody who might have 
been a soldier thompson couldnt figure out how all those people 
got into the ditch or why they might have run out of their bunkers 
into the open 
i remember coming upon one lady in the field she was wounded 
thrashing around on the ground in a lot of pain we called on the 
radio for assistance to help her out he said 
an individual american soldier walked up to her nudged her 
kicked her stepped back and blew her away 
in the ditch someone moved 
thompson and his two crew members went back his crew chief 
glen androtta disentangled a little girl from the mass of bodies 
thompson radioed for help while he held the child who was 
apparently unwounded but covered with blood 
i couldnt understand what was happening i couldnt 
understand why it was happening he said quietly were 
supposed to be the good guys 
the helicopter took the child to a hospital then returned 
thompson touched down between american officers led by a 
lieutenant and an openair bunker where an old man two old women 
and about a dozen children cowered 
i set down there and walked over and said hey theres 
some old women old men and kids in a bunker here can you get em 
out 
he the lieutenant said the only way to get them out was with 
a hand grenade 
i said hold your men right here and well go over and see if 
we can do better than that thompson recalled he said he didnt 
know if the lieutenant was calley who was the ranking officer at 
my lai 
asked about a story that he told one of his gunners to shoot the 
lieutenant if he tried to interfere thompson said something 
like that was said i dont recall the exact words 
thompson said he motioned the children and old people around to 
his helicopter then called in his gunships which picked up the 
little group 
they would have gotten killed he said 
in october 1969 the army crediting thompson with saving the 
lives of 16 children awarded him the distinguished flying cross 
calley was ordered courtmartialed the next month on charges of 
premeditated murder of 109 vietnamese 
he was convicted in march 1971 of firstdegree murder in the 
deaths of at least 22 villagers calley was the only one found 
guilty out of 25 officers and enlisted men who initially were 
charged and six who went on trial he served three years of house 
arrest at fort benning ga 
knowing that he did all he could and did right at my lai doesnt 
make thompsons memories any easier 
were supposed to be the ones on the white horse in the big 
white hats he said shaking his head

the peoples liberation army caught in 
transition between revolutionary force and modern army has been 
thrust into a key role in the standoff between the government and 
prodemocracy students 
as time passed and the governmentordered suppression of the 
monthlong student revolt failed to materialize the pla appeared 
illprepared or reluctant to carry out its mission 
young soldiers waiting in convoys on the outskirts of the 
capital took cigarettes and drinks from protesters and listened 
intently as students lectured them on the campaign for democratic 
reform 
some flashed vforvictory signs when their trucks retreated 
away from the city 
it was harder to decipher how senior military officers were 
reacting to the most serious challenge to the social order the 
communist party has faced in its 40year rule 
senior leader deng xiaopings one remaining official post is as 
head of the central military commission and it is believed to have 
been deng who ordered the crackdown on the student movement 
the 84yearold deng is certain to have the support of other 
older officers who served in the old red army and continue to 
regard the pla as the last bastion of revolutionary integrity 
less certain is the backing of younger officers the plas new 
ranks of professionals who may share some of the students concerns 
about the slow pace of political reform in china 
the pla played a major role in restoring order during the 
chaotic 196676 cultural revolution when fighting between 
different leftist factions brought china to the brink of civil war 
since then however the nations trust in the ideological 
purity of the pla has begun to slip 
in the early 1980s the army abandoned mao tsetungs concept of 
a guerrilla peoples war in which the army would beat back an 
attacker through sheer numbers and revolutionary fervor 
deng has reduced the number of troops by about 1 million since 
1985 when china fielded 42 million soldiers he has brought back 
a ranking system abandoned for 23 years emphasized better training 
and sought to create a modern military force 
the pla however has been saddled with severe budgetary 
restrictions as government funds were channeled to economic 
modernization programs about twothirds of defense industry 
factories have been switched to making civilian goods to help boost 
national production and exports 
from 1950 to 1980 defense spending accounted for 172 percent 
of chinas state expenditures the pla says in 1988 it received 
only 749 percent of the budget defense spending in actual terms 
is expected to fall about 6 percent this year after inflation 
in the past pla ranks were filled with young people attracted 
to the prestige of a military career and the possibility of 
escaping rural poverty pla members still command respect but the 
low pay and harsh living conditions have made recruiting more 
difficult 
in welloff rural areas families commonly pay off local 
officials to keep their sons off local quota lists for enlistment 
one recent report in the official media said the army is ending 
up with soldiers who are mentally retarded or illiterate or who 
have criminal records 
many recruits are eager to finish their term and return to 
civilian life so they can make money to buy the material comforts 
young people have come to expect such recruits are now listening 
with sympathy when students their own age chant the peoples army 
belongs to the people

french president francois mitterrand expressed 
optimism sunday that differences between the nato allies over 
european shortrange nuclear missiles can be reconciled before next 
weeks nato summit 
mitterrand appearing at a joint news conference with president 
bush was asked whether he was acting as an intermediary or 
conciliator in the missiles dispute 
he replied the only role i play is the role that is my 
natural role as a member of the alliance but im not particularly 
there to act as a mediator 
obviously im happy if views can be reconciled and i believe 
i think that they can be reconciled mitterrand said i think 
that we have now the elements of ideas that could form a decision 
that will be taken just in a weeks time 
he added i think that the decision that will be taken will be 
found positive from the point of view of all members of the 
alliance 
the west german government has been advocating immediate 
negotiations with the soviet union on shortrange nuclear missiles 
but the united states and britain have balked saying that moscow 
should first reduce its numerically superior conventional forces 
later in the news conference mitterrand noted that on this 
problem like on other problems at the outset people have 
diverging views different opinions but the important thing is to 
come to a meeting of the minds and to achieve a common answer and 
this has always been the case in the alliance 
the french leader was asked whether the cold war has now come to 
an end 
mitterrand replied that as far as the cold war is concerned 
one thing is clear and that is that we are moving out of the cold 
war and the chances are that this will be true for a very long 
time there will be moments when things will be more difficult 
doubtless but i dont imagine i dont see us slipping right back 
into the cold war 
he added of course anything is possible a lot will depend 
on the trend of developments within the soviet union 
mitterrand was asked whether he agreed with recent remarks by 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater in which the spokesman 
described soviet president mikhail s gorbachev as a drugstore 
cowboy 
mitterrand replied i think that one must be wary of 
caricatures mr gorbachev is worth very much more than that 
earlier the french president had shared commencement speaking 
duty with bush at boston university mitterrand devoted his speech 
remarks largely to the environment and said the earth is our 
planet so let us save it 
he departed for france in late afternoon

president najib on sunday offered a 
dozen guerrilla field commanders full autonomy in their regions if 
they stop fighting the government and help end the decadeold civil 
war 
in iran soviet deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov met with 
iranbased afghan guerrillas and said their view of the future of 
their country conformed with the soviet view tehran radio reported 
sunday vorontsov added that the guerrilla leaders had been invited 
to moscow the radio said 
najib also appealed to the exiled king to do what he can to help 
restore peace to afghanistan 
these people hold the destiny of future generations in their 
hands najib told the loya jirgah the supreme governing body 
a nonaligned and free afghanistan cannot be obtained through 
military activities 
the loya jirgah or grand assembly met over the weekend to 
extend a nationwide state of emergency for six months and empower 
the president to add another six months if he deems necessary 
the state of emergency was declared feb 18 three days after 
the last soviet troops left afghanistan and ended their nineyear 
military involvement in the country 
the loya jirgah meeting for only the 17th time since it was 
formed in 1702 is comprised of government officials businessmen 
and tribal leaders it meets to decide matters of pressing national 
importance 
in the assemblys opening session saturday najib said a 
threemember commission would be appointed to negotiate with the 
guerrillas anywhere at any time and on any terms 
on sunday he went a step further and made his pitch to a dozen 
field commanders operating inside the country 
his moves were seen as signs the kabul government is feeling the 
pressure of defending itself without soviet troops 
it is a great burden to be a field commander and i realize 
they have borne a great and arduous weight unlike the luxury their 
leaders have enjoyed in exile said najib who uses one name 
najib said the government would help them if they stopped 
fighting and agreed to reconciliation 
they can have power and sovereignty in their locality they 
can have full military rank and full military authority and they 
can keep their weapons they will be permitted their own autonomous 
administration he said 
najib said his government met with field commanders inside 
afghanistan and with guerrilla leaders in neighboring pakistan 
where the moslem guerrillas are based but he gave no details of 
the talks 
asked if the dozen field commanders named by najib had been 
contacted by the government foreign ministry spokesman mohammad 
nabi amani said its a safe assumption 
amani said 15 field commanders either sat in on the loya jirgah 
sessions or sent representatives five of them were specifically 
invited by the president he said 
in a major policy reversal najib also appealed to mohammad 
zahir shah 74 the former king who has been living in exile in 
rome since he was overthrown by his cousin mohammad daud in 1973 
the ruling communist peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
seized power from daud in an april 1978 coup 
he could be central to peace in this country najib said 
the afghan guerrillas are split into two alliances the larger 
pakistanbased sunni moslem cooalition and the minority shiite 
moslem alliance based in iran 
both groups engaged soviet soldiers in heavy fighting after the 
1979 invasion but they have been at odds since the formation of an 
interim afghan government in which the shiite alliance is not 
represented 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted vorontsov as saying 
that the guerrilla spokesman was against foreign intervention in 
afghanistan and has expressed support for a broadbased government 
in afghanistan 
our stance conforms completely with this view and i have 
asked the leaders of the iranbased alliance to visit moscow and 
they have said that they will think about the timing of such a 
trip he said

two boys who picketed a courthouse urging 
a judge to keep their younger siblings in a foster home away from 
their homeless mother said sunday that the judge has decided the 
case to their liking 
it was worth it 13yearold peter carnes said of the 
afterschool protests he and 12yearold brother danny staged twice 
last month outside the kandiyohi county courthouse at least for 
now we know they are not going back to their mother 
the boys said their mother margo senescall wanted to regain 
custody of her two youngest children to beef up her welfare checks 
based on their own childhood experiences the two boys said their 
9yearold sister and 10yearold brother would be subject to abuse 
under her care 
ms senescall could not be reached for comment telephone calls 
to the homeless shelter in minneapolis where she lives were not 
returned her attorney jay liedman of willmar declined to comment 
peter carnes said sunday that judge john lindstrom has decided 
for now to keep the younger children in a foster home in willmar 
not far from the foster home where he and danny live 
lindstrom said he could not comment because custody cases are 
confidential 
i have made a decision and thats about all i can say 
lindstrom said sunday there is nothing currently before me 
doris lyman the boys foster mother confirmed peters account 
of the judges decision 
as far as i know its 100 percent true lyman said for 
now thats the way its going to be but how long nobody knows 
danny carnes said the boys decided to picket after they pleaded 
with the judge unsuccessfully to throw out their mothers request 
we talked to the judge but he didnt listen danny said 
we told him our brother and sister might get killed and he said 
thats the chance we have to take 
the picketing was peters idea he said at first we felt 
weird but after a while we got used to it and it did us some good 
the boys said their picketing in this westcentral minnesota 
town of about 13600 prompted letters on their behalf and a lawyer 
to volunteer his services 
it was the lawyer who informed them of the judges decision 
because the boys were not allowed to attend court hearings peter 
carnes said the lawyer pete hendrickson of minneapolis told the 
boys there is still a chance their mother could regain custody of 
the younger children peter said 
lindstrom has said custody cases are subject to review until 
children reach adulthood 
he said in an interview that he was not swayed by the picketing 
he said he relied strictly on evidence and testimony in court 
where he heard conflicting stories 
i admire their courage lindstrom said they are obviously 
deeply concerned i think its the picketing a very legitimate 
forum for them to express their concerns 
peter carnes said he was sexually and physically abused by men 
while he was under his mothers care he says he complained about 
the abuse but she did nothing 
she acts like she cares but she doesnt he said 
danny carnes says he also was physically abused by men while 
with his mother the boys parents divorced before the boys entered 
elementary school and ms senescall agreed about seven years ago to 
put the children in foster homes peter and danny said 
willard carnes 52 of renville said he couldnt care for his 
children because his job as a farm hand keeps him away from home 
for long stretches and he doesnt earn much money he said his 
exwife is unfit to care for the children but he wouldnt give

opposition of its discontent with the rallies in churches in 
the hope that this kind of action will not be repeated 
sundays mass was delayed as dozens of journalists gathered 
around the front of the altar the rev jose luis andrade the 
parish priest appealed for respect for the sanctity of this 
house of god and the area was cleared

can come to mass here but we are here to honor god and this 
cannot be converted into a political act he told the associated 
press before saying mass 
the government on saturday prohibited marches meetings 
public demonstrations or caravans of vehicles by any political 
organization until at least june 5

saturday they were in a motorcade that drove through panama city 
drawing cheering crowds

tobago accompanied by oas secretarygeneral joao baena soares are 
due in panama tuesday to try to help resolve panamas governmental

has been no response from president hissene habres government 
about 40 countries in which french is spoken ranging from 
canada to haiti to madagascar to vietnam are expected to attend 
the dakar meeting

directed at former french colonies in africa even france and 
switzerland did not escape criticism 
the swiss were criticized for refusing to allow conscientious 
objectors to perform civilian service as an alternative to their 
draft duty and the french for requiring objectors to serve two 
years of alternative service compared with just one year for army 
draftees

egypt was officially welcomed back to 
the arab fold after an absence of 10 years as the arab league 
opened a ministerial meeting sunday to prepare for a summit 
conference 
moroccan foreign minister abdellatif filali in the opening 
address said we are all witnessing today an important 
historical event demonstrated in the participation of the arab 
republic of egypts delegation in our meetings after a long 
absence 
two seats for delegates from the 22nation arab league were 
vacant at the conference hall 
libya is boycotting the session because it opposes egypts 
return to the league and there was no representative from lebanon 
where there are rival christian and moslem governments 
egypts membership was suspended after former president anwar 
sadat signed a peace treaty with israel in 1979 
i am certain that egypts return to the arab league and the 
resumption of its full membership in our organization will 
contribute to joint arab action and the strengthening of arab 
solidarity filali said 
egyptian foreign minister ismat abdelmeguid said in response 
egypt is pleased to resume its membership and the historical and 
important responsibilities that entails 
it also stresses it shall fulfill its duties in accordance 
with the arab league charter 
egyptian president hosni mubarak is expected to attend the 
summit conference that opens tuesday 
the ministerial meeting began at 7 pm after several delays 
because of a sixmember committee discussion of the situation in 
lebanon where christian militias have been waging artillery duels 
with syrian army units and their druse allies 
the committee did not submit a report but agreed to recommend to 
the arab leaders that both of lebanons declared prime ministers 
christian michel aoun and moslem salim hoss be invited to the 
summit 
syria the main power broker in lebanon voiced reservations 
about the proposal to invite gen aoun who has vowed to dislodge 
syrian forces from lebanon according to conference sources who 
spoke with the condition they not be identified 
lebanon and the palestinian uprising in the israeli occupied 
west bank and gaza strip will be two of the main topics at the 
summit 
the palestine liberation organization is expected to complain 
that it has not received the aid promised at the last arab summit 
in algeria in june 1988 
plo officials say league members promised to give the 
organization a 128 million onetime payment and then 43 million 
per month 
they said only saudi arabia and libya contributed to the 
onetime payment with the saudis providing 28 million and libya 
12 million 
they also said the plo has received only 12 million in promised 
monthly allocations

air force crews responding to the collapse 
of an mx missile in an underground silo last summer were concerned 
that the rocket could have accidentally ignited according to a 
report published sunday 
ignition inside silo q10 at fe warren air force base could 
have strewn highly radioactive plutonium around the site near 
guernsey the casper startribune said in a report based on the air 
forces final accident report which the newspaper obtained through 
a freedom of information request 
lt col charles r banta was quoted in the accident report as 
saying work crews worried that the rockets solid fuel might have 
been cracked by the collapse 
if you have cracked propellant and you start moving it you 
can get friction within the crack and there was concern that it 
could cause ignition he said 
it the missiles condition was an unknown we were operating 
under the rocket maker morton thiokol premise that said it was 
relatively stable if you dont move too fast and dont put a lot 
of energy into the system nothing will happen said banta 
air force officials declined comment when contacted by the 
newspaper saying the report spoke for itself 
the missile capable of delivering 10 nuclear warheads slid 
roughly 6 inches down in its silo sometime between last june 12 and 
june 15 when part of the rockets aft skirt collapsed 
during the incident the missile gave a missile away signal 
but air force officials in their initial report attributed that to 
the rockets umbilical cord breaking away when the weapon settled 
to the base of its silo 
the washington post reported in january that the accident led 
the air force to take the heavy warheads off that missile and four 
others from the same production batch that had a common problem 
the newspaper said the action ws taken to relieve weight on the 
missile until the problem could be solved 
investigation determined that the collapsed missiles fuel did 
not crack in addition the severing of the umbilical cord meant 
there was no direct electrical connection and a grounding system to 
protect the missile from static electricity was intact the 
newspaper said 
the air force placed odds of an accidental ignition at less than 
one chance in 10 million 
an outside military authority retired navy capt james t bush 
told the startribune the ignition danger was much higher but 
admitted he had no involvement with the mx missile he is associate 
director of the center for defense information in washington 
bush said the greatest danger of an accidental ignition of the 
solid rocket fuel is the heat it would create inside the sealed 
silo 
this fire would cook off or explode the he high explosive 
component of the warhead he said you then have a high 
explosive yield which would possibly blow open the missile hatch 
and distribute radioactive material for some unknown distance that 
would be very bad

condition sunday and his doctors said the former philippines 
president was alert and responding to medication 
marcos 71 is undergoing kidney dialysis has a respirator to 
help him breath and is hooked up to a monitoring system said 
eugene tiwanak assistant adminstrator of st francis medical 
center

upswing mode tiwanak said at what was to be the only scheduled

with doctors through hand signals tiwanak said 
marcos wife imelda meanwhile denounced statements attributed 
to marcos supporters during a rally in manila on saturday that 
americans would be killed if marcos dies in exile 
the statement might have been the work of radicals infiltrating 
marcos supporters and attempting to provoke a violent reaction to 
philippines president corazon aquinos announcement that marcos 
will not be allowed to return even if he dies mrs marcos said 
it was precisely to bring about a reconciliation and to avoid 
a continuation of this division that transcending my own pain and 
hurt i appealed to madame aquino to allow marcos to return to die 
in his homeland she said 
i dont want violence and im afraid that the hardline 
statements of the madame aquino have caused this emotional 
reaction among some people she said 
the philippine supreme court on friday denied the marcoses 
petition to force the government to allow their return 
we are being kicked back and forth like a football and the 
united states is being made into the fall guy mrs marcos said 
during a convention in manila of a revived opposition party 
sen juan ponce enrile who played a key role in the revolt against 
marcos said sunday that mrs aquino should display leadership by 
allowing marcos to return to die in his homeland

party said there is no reason why he should be deprived of his 
right to come home at this time of his life hes so ill how can

president bush facing disarmament pressure from 
europe expressed concern sunday about a growing complacency 
throughout the west and said america and her allies must not drop 
their guard against the soviet union 
he said that in an era of extraordinary change in the soviet 
union we have an obligation to temper optimism and i am 
optimistic with prudence his comments came in remarks at 
boston university where he shared commencement speaking duty with 
french president francois mitterrand bush returned to washington 
on sunday night 
pointing to moscows threat to retain some nuclear missiles 
banned by a 1987 treaty if nato upgrades its shortrange arsenal 
bush said it is clear that soviet new thinking has not yet 
totally overcome the old 
later in a twolanguage joint news conference bush and 
mitterrand both expressed optimism that a rift within nato over 
shortrange european missiles could be bridged before next weeks 
nato summit 
a spokesman for the west german government hans klein said 
bonn also is confident that a resolution can be reached before the 
meeting he said one proposal forms a basis for a solution but no 
agreement has yet been reached 
bush said i think we could well have this resolved before the 
summit 
he said american officials have been in close touch with british 
prime minister margaret thatcher on the missile issue adding that 
he agrees with her that we can get together on this vexing 
question 
my role has been behind the scenes to be helpful in working 
this problem to iron out those differences bush said 
mitterrand said nato periodically faces internal controversies 
such as the current one adding he was hopeful this latest 
difficulty would be resolved before the summit opens id be 
happy if the views can be reconciled the french leader said 
mitterrand fielded one news conference question by dismissing a 
comment from white house spokesman marlin fitzwater that soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev was a drugstore cowboy whose arms 
control proposals lack substance 
mr gorbachev is worth very much more than that mitterrand 
said dismissing caricatures 
as the words were translated bush laughed and said so much 
for marlin he added i could defend marlin but he neither 
did that nor disavowed the spokesmans earlier remark 
mitterrand devoted his commencement address remarks largely to 
the environment and said the earth is our planet so let us save 
it 
the two leaders flew here together after a day of talks saturday 
at bushs vacation estate overlooking the atlantic ocean on a rocky 
point in kennebunkport maine 
they spoke before a commencement audience estimated at 31000 
people attending the ceremony at nickerson field football stadium 
in the hometown of gov michael dukakis his defeated rival for the 
white house bush got a standing ovation but the cheers for 
dukakis also on the stage were louder 
bushs speech was designed to set the stage for the nato summit 
opening in brussels on may 29 the 16nation meeting has been 
threatened by discord over shortrange nuclear missiles in central 
europe 
over opposition from the united states and britain west germany 
has been leading a call for eastwest negotiations to reduce the 
weapons and has been resisting plans to upgrade the missiles 
the dispute has been aggravated by a series of disarmament 
offers from moscow that have put pressure on the west to take 
similar steps 
senate majority leader george mitchell criticized bush last 
week saying he was responding too timidly to arms proposals from 
the soviet union 
praising french and british programs to upgrade their nuclear 
weapons bush said we do have a major concern theres a growing 
complacency throughout the west 
underscoring his remark he said there was a great irony in 
that while an ideological earthquake is shaking asunder the very 
communist foundation the west is being tested by complacency 
we must never forget that twice in this century american 
blood has been shed over conflicts that began in europe bush 
said 
calling the atlantic alliance central to us foreign policy 
bush said we must never forget that to keep the peace in europe 
is to keep the peace for america 
without referring directly to the missile dispute bush said 
nuclear weapons are an essential ingredient for the defense of 
europe 
our shortrange deterrent forces based in europe and kept up 
to date demonstrate that americas vital interests are bound 
inextricably to western europe and that an attacker can never 
gamble on a test of strength with just our conventional forces 
the president said 
though hope is now running high for a more peaceful continent 
the history of this century teaches americans and europeans to 
remain prepared bush said 
he said he was grateful for steps taken by gorbachev saying 
if the soviets advance solid and constructive plans for peace 
then we should give credit where credit is due 
we are seeing sweeping changes in the soviet union that show 
promise of enduring of becoming ingrained bush said 
at the same time in an era of extraordinary change we have 
an obligation to temper optimism and i am optimistic with 
prudence 
bush said i believe in a stepbystep approach to eastwest 
relations because recurring signs show that while change in the 
soviet union is dramatic it is not yet complete 
he said the sovietled warsaw pact retains nearly a 12to1 
advantage over the atlantic alliance in shortrange missile and 
rocket launchers and more than a 2to1 edge in battle tanks 
on an economic front bush spoke warmly yet cautiously about 
western europes plans for a single common market free of internal 
trade barriers by 1992 
he said that despite apprehensions in some quarters about what a 
united europe will bring this administration is of one mind we 
believe a strong united europe means a strong america 
it is important to distinguish adversaries from allies and 
allies from adversaries bush said what a tragedy what an 
absurdity it would be if future historians attribute the demise 
of the western alliance to disputes over beef hormones and wars 
over pasta that was a reference to two trade areas that have 
separated the united states and europe

gov bob martinez may try to use 
floridas 17 billion pension fund to back the purchase of eastern 
airlines in an effort to protect jobs provided by the miamibased 
airline according to reports sunday 
two newspapers the miami herald and the palm beach post 
reported that an investment of at least 50 million was being 
considered given the proper guarantees against loss 
two highranking state aides were in new york friday for talks 
with officials of eastern airlines pilot union and financial and 
legal consultants 
one of them brian ballard martinez chief of operations 
confirmed the negotiations 
martinez is extremely interested in protecting floridians 
jobs and wants to keep eastern in one piece and in florida but 
well do nothing that wouldnt be an outstanding investment for 
floridas pension holders 
the loan was proposed by the air line pilots association whose 
support of striking machinists has kept the miamibased airline 
virtually grounded since march 4 
we propose to to give them a very secure investment for the 
pension plan and get eastern back said randolph babbitt 
executive administrator of alpa 
at the time the strike began eastern employed about 30000 
workers 12000 of them in florida 
the unions were seeking the financial help as part of 
negotiations between the airline unions and two potential buyers 
chicago commodities trader joseph ritchie and former piedmont 
aviation inc president william howard 
an eastern spokesman scoffed at the investment idea saturday 
the ritchie and howard proposals can best be described as 
humptydumpty robin matell said neither one is economically 
realistic if the state chooses to invest its money that way it 
will probably be the fastest method on record to find out whether 
pensioners can survive on social security checks alone 
details of the offers from ritchie and howard have been 
unavailable but both reportedly call for 210 million in wage 
concessions in each of the next five years in exchange for partial 
ownership 
a representative of howards investor group said its bid 
included 725 million in new capital although only a small part 
would be cash 
to complete the deal and satisfy a federal bankruptcy judge in 
new york who must approve the sale the unions would need to raise 
at least 50 million more babbitt said searching for the balance 
union officials approached the state and other pension funds 
babbitt said 
to guarantee the state money the unions would agree to place 1 
percent of the airlines labor payroll in an escrow account as 
insurance that the state would receive a return on the investment 
labor can guarantee that money if for any reason the company 
was unable to pay dividends for the states investment babbitt 
said 
cliff hinkle executive director of the state board of 
administration who traveled to new york with ballard refused to 
discuss specifics but noted that we look at investment 
possibilities every day 
floridas pension fund is one of the healthiest in the nation 
containing about 17 billion in a diverse portfolio of common 
stocks bonds and real estate it is the 12th largest in the united 
states and 25th largest in the world hinkle said 
as governor martinez sits at the head of the states 
threemember board of administration which oversees state 
investments 
eastern has been under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 
march 9 any sale must be approved by us bankruptcy judge burton 
lifland who on monday will receive a report on the offers by 
howard and ritchie and consider developer donald trumps offer to 
buy the airlines shuttle service between boston new york and 
washington 
frank lorenzo chairman of eastern parent company texas air 
corp has proposed selling 18 billion in assets to restructure 
the airline into a smaller operation 
in addition to trumps 365 million offer for the shuttle 
phoenixbased america west airlines has made a 751million bid for 
the shuttle and 15 boeing 757s usair has offered 525 million for 
15 boeing 757s maintenance hangers and airport landing slots in 10 
cities

a california condor chick was coaxed from its 
egg sunday as keepers clucked over the years third successful 
hatching in an ongoing effort to save the giant vulture from 
extinction 
the chick named kaduku was the first conceived by a pair of 
6yearold birds at the los angeles zoo changing biologists 
notions about when condors reach sexual maturity said san diego 
wild animal park spokesman tom hanscom 
it previously was not known if california condors achieved 
full sexual maturity at age 6 or 7 hanscom said it was 
thought to be 7 but these birds proved us wrong 
the sparsely feathered bird hatched from a pale aquacolored 
egg laid on easter sunday weighed 58 ounces after it was helped 
from the shell by handlers at the san diego park around 1120 am 
hanscom said 
it was our easter egg said los angeles zoo spokeswoman 
cindy richardson it looks really healthy and is doing great 
the baby whose konkow indian name means very strong being 
both physically and spiritually joined two other chicks at the 
parks socalled condorminium and was scheduled to take its 
first meal of minced mouse meat sunday night 
the baby bird conceived by a pair of birds named cayuma and 
cachuma was the fourth captivebred condor chick successfully 
hatched bringing the worlds california condor population to 31 
all remaining wild condors which are north americas largest 
land birds have been captured in hopes of building their numbers 
in captivity 
seventeen condors are housed at the animal park in northern san 
diego county about 30 miles northeast of downtown san diego and 
the other 14 live at the los angeles zoo 
sundays hatching followed one on thursday and the years first 
on april 19 the first captivebred chick named molloko hatched 
in 1988 and remains in good health as do the other chicks 
like all previous captive condor chicks kaduku was brought to 
the condormimium in san diego as soon as the egg was laid in 
hopes the parents would produce another egg to replace it 
the female cachuma previously produced another egg but it was 
infertile 
los angeles zoo officials have been encouraged by the pairs 
continued affectionate behavior saying they hoped the birds would 
become productive members of the breeding program 
the chicks are raised by handlers who use lifelike 
condorreplica puppets to feed the birds allowing for close 
scrutiny of their daily progress by while maintaining the chicks 
identification with their own kind 
the captivebreeding program was established when numbers of the 
black carrioneaters dwindled because of shooting and pesticide 
contamination

choreographer twyla tharp artistic associate of 
american ballet theater has some new ballets for the company this 
season 
instead of slipping them into the repertoire one a week as 
might be expected the company premiered three with a flourish on 
the same night saturday at the metropolitan opera house 
the first everlast is set in 1919 and tells a story like 
a charming movie of the keystone kops era of a girl danced by 
susan jaffe whose mother decides to marry her off to a boxing 
champ danced by kevin oday for his money the girl prefers 
dancing with the boys in the chorus 
a waitress anne adair falls for the champ and dresses like a 
boy to get hired to work with his trainer a couple of old 
busybodies danced by shelley washington and kathleen moore 
provide comic relief in an already lighthearted dance they scoot 
in with potted trees in front of them to spy on the ohyoukid 
goings on and report to the mother danced by georgina parkinson 
the music is 16 songs by jerome kern chosen for lyrics that 
tell the story judy blazer jason graae and molly wasserman sang 
them on stage with michael dansicker at an upright piano 
everlast at 40 minutes is shorter than fred astaire movie 
musicals because the plot is told by instead of interrupted by 
the songs and dancing there is real dancing in everlast as a 
solo to left all alone again blues 
we very much admire quartet the second new york premiere 
which uses four dancers and a recording by the kronos quartet of 
terry riley music its in the tradition of modernlooking 
plotless ballets to modern music like episodes which george 
balanchine choreographed to webern 
alessandra ferri ricardo bustamente susan jaffe and jeremy 
collins looked good often dancing in unison sometimes one 
couples dancing echoing what the other had just done wearing 
crisp white shirts and black shorts they moved constantly but 
never seemed frenetic 
miss tharp is known for novelty and bums rush which we 
liked least of the three is a novelty ballet set on a vaudeville 
stage stagehands dance so does a baggypants comedian a truck 
tire with shapely legs and toe shoes sticking down from it walks 
around gets between a ballerina and her partner or amusingly 
collapses on itself 
dick hyman composed music for the halfhour romp our favorite 
part of it was jazz dancing by two men and our least favorite part 
slapstick by three men making animal noises 
the three dances were premiered earlier this year in san 
francisco miami beach and chicago respectively the evening ended 
with an older twyla tharp dance in the upper room

streets to defend the students from a feared military crackdown 
city residents surrounded troop convoys with thousands of people 
and blocked major roads with public buses trucks and garbage cans 
protesters drove buses up to subway entrances on the square to 
block any emerging troops 
supporters also formed a human cordon around the protesters at 
tiananmen while motorcyclists and bicyclists signaled their

from a machine factory they should step down and let china 
become a powerful country

at the vast square students sang the internationale and the 
chinese national anthem as the reported 5 am monday 4 pm edt 
sunday deadline for leaving the square went by without incident 
we will not retreat from the square student leader wang dan 
said over a loudspeaker he led the 200000 students and supporters 
in a pledge we wont give up until we reach our goals 
there were no reports of movement by soldiers who on saturday 
occupied major staterun news organizations and sealed off some 
roads leading into the capital

had moved into the train station about a mile east of the square 
but the troops did not appear during the night 
the independent student union that has led the protests 
announced it received a message from li saying the military would 
clear tiananmen by force by 5 am 
the student loudspeaker announced that the union had rejected 
lis ultimatum and called on the protesters to remain calm and 
restrained

been given and read a statement that the troops goal was to 
restore order not suppress the students but it was clear order 
could not be restored without ending the occupation of tiananmen 
the focus of five weeks of prodemocracy protests 
the students are demanding a nationally televised dialogue with 
the government recognition of their independent student unions and 
government measures to ensure freedom of the press and an end to 
official corruption 
li called in the 27th and 28th armies friday night and declared 
martial law in central beijing on saturday however his inability 
to enforce martial law made it clear an intense political struggle 
was going on behind the scenes

secretary zhao ziyang said by chinese sources to have resigned in 
protest remained unclear there was no official statement 
the exact number of soldiers called in was not immediately known

universities which have been the center of the prodemocracy 
protests to keep order

200 buses and trolleys were being used as roadblocks around the 
city he said city supplies of coal and liquified gas were running 
low and that the roadblocks hindered the transport of milk eggs 
and other staples

food and water

reported several hundred marched in the coastal city of tianjin a 
reporter there said 
in hong kong a british colony that will come under chinese rule 
in 1999 about 400000 people marched peacefully to support the 
prodemocratic movement 
in tokyo thousands of chinese studying in japan marched 
downtown to protest the declaration of martial law in beijing 
the standoff in the square began may 13 when students began a 
hunger strike the hunger strike was called off saturday but the 
protest has grown to include chinese from all walks of life 
under martial law foreign reporters were told they could not 
conduct interviews take pictures or make tapes or videos at many 
locations

up to 40000 antiabortion demonstrators turned 
out for a peaceful rally in downtown st louis on sunday police 
said 
lt roy miller said the demonstrators who rallied at kiener 
plaza after marching several blocks gathered without incident and 
no arrests were made 
there were no physical confrontations miller said their 
adversaries were giving a few catcalls and such but thats about 
it 
organizers called it the largest antiabortion rally ever in st 
louis miller said the crowd was estimated at 40000 but several 
police officers at the scene as well as prochoice supporters 
disagreed they said only about 5000 to 10000 demonstrators were 
on hand 
the showme life rally came several weeks after the us 
supreme court heard arguments in a missouri abortion case which 
could be used to overturn the landmark roe vs wade decision that 
legalized the procedure in 1973 
the court is expected to announce its decision this summer in 
the case webster vs reproductive health services 
the missouri law at issue passed in 1986 declares that human 
life begins at conception it restricts abortion by banning the 
procedure in publicly funded hospitals and by forbidding the use of 
public funds 
loretto wagner of missouri citizens for life said rally 
organizers hoped to impress the supreme court with the number of 
people who attended

former president reagan said sunday the house of 
representatives has become almost a permanent chamber with less 
turnover than the supreme soviet and called for fairness in 
congressional redistricting 
reagan urged state governments to set up bipartisan citizen 
commissions to redraw boundaries after the 1990 national census 
i think it will be a big issue in the 1990s and i intend to be 
in the thick of it reagan said in a 20minute speech to more 
than 4000 people attending the national restaurant associations 
70th restaurant and hotelmotel show 
i am putting the legislators on notice to keep it fair or they 
may find the gipper on the steps of their state capitols calling 
attention to their shenanigans he said drawing laughter 
reagan also called for steps to balance the federal budget 
saying he was working to help future presidents get the tools 
they need to bring the budget under control including a 
constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget and the 
presidential power to veto a budget line by line 
the republican senior statesman said the house of 
representatives which is dominated by democrats has become 
virtually a permanent chamber 
it has less turnover than the supreme soviet reagan said 
adding that 98 percent of the incumbents who ran for reelection 
last year won 
he called gerrymandering the rigging of congressional 
districts boundaries to assure a majority vote to one party or 
another an abuse of power that distorts democracy 
reagan said americans must be vigilant and protective of their 
powers or those powers will be ceded to washington 
be strong and courageous go to the polls take an 
interest in government and let your representatives know how you 
feel and what you want he said 
he reiterated his support for repealing the 22nd amendment to 
the us constitution which limits a president to two terms 
since im already out to pasture this amendment doesnt affect 
me but i think it should be repealed he said labeling it 
another area where the peoples democratic rights are being 
thwarted 
after his speech reagan stayed on stage for 40 minutes to 
answer questions from the audience sign autographs and shake hands 
asked what he was doing with his spare time he noted that he 
had made a number of speeches in the four months since he left the 
presidency

a revived opposition party urged 
president corazon aquino sunday to call new elections and the 
groups new secretarygeneral said the president should allow 
ferdinand marcos to return as a sign of her leadership 
the call came at the end of a oneday convention of the 
nationalista party the 4000 delegates agreed to revive the party 
as the major opposition movement against mrs aquino 
vice president salvador laurel was named party president sen 
juan ponce enrile was designated secretarygeneral and blas ople a 
labor minister under marcos was chosen executive vice president 
both by acclamation 
laurel quit as foreign secretary on september 1987 and refused 
to serve in the cabinet claiming fundamental differences with 
mrs aquino laurel remains as vice president which is an elective 
post 
during the convention enrile a former defense minister said 
mrs aquino should display leadership by allowing marcos to return 
from hawaii to die in his homeland 
we believe that marcos should be allowed to come back 
enrile said there is no reason why he should be deprived of his 
right to come home at this time of his life hes so ill how can 
he destabilize the country 
the former president was reported in critical condition sunday 
in a honolulu hospital after undergoing emergency kidney surgery 
hospital officials said his prognosis is poor although he showed 
signs of responding to treatment 
on friday mrs aquino refused to allow marcos to return and 
said her government would not allow him to buried in the 
philippines marcos has lived in hawaii since he was ousted in a 
popular uprising in february 1986 that propelled mrs aquino to 
power 
mrs aquino has cited national security for refusing previous 
bids by marcos to come home 
if mrs aquino feels she is the leader of the country then 
she should show that she is by controlling the situation where her 
worst perceived enemy is inside the country not when he is outside 
and dying enrile said 
enrile played a key role in a military revolt against marcos 
which triggered the people power uprising that toppled the 
former president mrs aquino retained enrile as defense chief but 
fired him in november 1986 after a coup attempt by his followers 
sundays convention was the latest attempt to put together a 
unified viable opposition to mrs aquino 
previous attempts to build an opposition party have foundered 
because of personal rivalries and the fact that many leading 
figures are tainted by their previous links to marcos 
the nacionalistas who suspended activities when marcos declared 
eight years of martial rule in 1972 hope to win the presidency in 
1992 when mrs aquinos term expires she has said she will not 
seek reelection

a highrise building wracked by two 
demolition blasts leaned precariously but did not fall sunday 
prompting officials to evacuate nearby residents while wrecking 
crews moved in with a crane 
weve got one building leaning and one building leaning 
against it said police major john power its a hazardous 
condition and i dont know what could happen 
a cloud of smoke rose from the bottom of the building around 
830 am but the 10story tower remained standing patrolman john 
egan said demolition crews were not sure why the implosion did not 
work 
the demolition experts who had used 500 pounds of dynamite in 
the first implosion fetched 36 pounds of more explosives and 
staged a second effort this time part of the building tipped 
slightly and leaned against another tower that may also face 
demolition but the structure remained standing 
a ball and crane were at the scene but officials said 
demolition plans still had to be made stephen orourke head of 
the citys housing authority said it could take up to two weeks 
for the wrecking crews to dismantle the listing building 
police had warned people to watch the second try from home on 
their televisions after officers had problems with crowding at the 
site 
three streets were partially cordoned off for the night power 
said a few families living nearby would have to find somewhere else 
to stay until the building was brought down residents without a 
place to go would be accommodated officials said 
the two towers and one other are the subject of a federal 
lawsuit filed by project basic a housing advocacy group against 
the providence housing authority 
us district judge raymond pettine allowed the tower to be 
demolished after architects ruled that the building when being 
prepared for demolition was made unsafe 
but pettines april 21 temporary restraining order against 
demolition still stands for the two other towers project basic 
contends the buildings are structurally safe and should be 
preserved because of the need for lowincome housing 
the housing authority had planned to build smaller residential 
buildings at the site

rehabilitation of premier imre nagy executed after the 1956 
revolution

conference of the reform movement it followed a meeting in 
kecskemet on april 15 when communist party members urged major

political issues as to where the party is going 
representatives to the congress should be elected at local 
levels 
the party should reject democratic centralism the 
principle that the minority should accept all decisions adopted by 
the majority 
the communist party should change its name to hungarian 
socialist party democratic socialist peoples party or the 
hungarian reform party to reflect its new democratic character 
but the issue of the rehabilitation of nagy the premier when 
the soviets sent troops into hungary to crush a revolt was the 
most emotional issue

the burial ceremony is to be broadcast by state television but 
the government has no plans to be officially represented

break with the soviet union and warsaw pact and others convicted

politburo told a news conference saturday the impatience of 
reformers for a quick decision on nabys rehabilitation was 
justified but he said he would wait until the public prosecutor 
files a final report expected sometime this fall

when financier michael milken addressed 
several hundred exshipyard workers few seemed to care that hed 
been indicted in the biggestever securities fraud case for them 
this man was a messianic cheerleader who pledged to help get their 
jobs and company back 
it may have been milkens highschool cheerleading experience 
that helped the junkbond dealer from beverly hills who delivered 
a rousing speech to the crowd at the local sons of italy hall 
his subject was the fore river shipyard which he promised to 
help the workers reopen with financing arranged by his former 
employer drexel burnham lambert inc 
when the first ship rolls in here on october first i look 
forward to coming back and shaking your hands he said 
ever since general dynamics closed the 182acre yard three years 
ago workers have dreamed of reopening it as an employeeowned 
business 
the moraleboosting april 27 speech by milken principal 
defendant in a 98count securities fraud and racketeering 
indictment announced a month earlier was only the latest twist in 
their saga 
quincy a city of 85000 people south of boston has a 
centuryold tradition of shipbuilding oldtimers proudly recount 
how they turned out the aircraft carriers wasp and lexington the 
battleship massachusetts and the first nuclear powered cruiser the 
uss long beach 
its a family tradition for a lot of us said arthur durand 
62 i worked there my father worked there and my son worked 
there it takes skill and pride to pass it on from generation to 
generation and its something we dont want to lose 
the yard was founded in 1884 by dr john watson an assistant to 
alexander graham bell and was managed after world war ii by joseph 
kennedy sr father of the late president 
for the first 75 years it thrived on innovation as wood gave 
way to steel and sails to coal and oil when the navy shrank after 
1945 the yard began a long decline slipping from a wartime peak 
of 16000 employees to 5000 in 1985 and 1000 when it closed in 
may 1986 
the next year st louisbased general dynamics sold the yard 
and several buildings for 495 million to the massachusetts water 
resources authority a quasipublic agency responsible for cleaning 
polluted boston harbor 
with support from gov michael s dukakis the mwra began 
negotiating a lease with the workers who formed massachusetts 
shipbuilders inc 
but the workers were frustrated for two years as negotiations 
foundered on such issues as hazardous waste liability and the 
mwras desire to use some of the yard for its own purposes 
the lease finally negotiated last october will allow the 
workers to use 70 acres rentfree for two years after that the 
rent will gradually rise from 100000 in the third year to 1 
million in the seventh 
to keep the workers dream alive the state has pumped nearly 
500000 into the project although most of the former general 
dynamics employees have found new jobs nearly 1000 have signed 
cards saying they would like to return to work at fore river 
peter gwyn a former general dynamics manager who is president 
of massachusetts shipbuilders said he has talked with ship owners 
about potential contracts and is optimistic the yard could begin 
building and repairing vessels again in october 
the plan hinges however on financing from drexel known for 
its ability to raise huge amounts of money through the sale of 
highyield debt securities commonly known as junk bonds the 
securities are considered riskier for buyers than other forms of 
corporate debt 
pat flanagan a vice president in the investment banks boston 
office approached the workers about junkbond financing last 
october shortly after the lease with the mwra was signed 
with milkens help flanagan worked out a 173 million package 
consisting of 13 million in commercial loans plus a 33 million 
investment by drexel and 1 million from the massachusetts capital 
resource co a group of insurance companies 
in return for their investments drexel and the insurance group 
will receive a 33 percent stake in the shipyard the remaining 67 
percent will go to the workers through an employee stock ownership 
plan 
if the us economic development administration agrees to 
guarantee 80 percent of the commercial loans the financing could 
be in place by june 30 and the first workers rehired a few weeks 
later 
drexel executives say that despite milkens appearance at the 
sons of italy hall he has been no more than a cheerleader on the 
sidelines since march when drexel agreed to dismiss him as part of 
its own deal to settle securitiesfraud charges with the government 
prior to the settlement michael was very involved both as a 
supporter of the shipyard and as somebody who was intimately 
involved in arranging the financing and helping to structure the 
transaction flanagan said 
but flanagan added his role going forward is just as a 
supporter he has no official role either as adviser or financier 
to the shipyard 
nevertheless some workers still have warm feelings toward the 
man considered responsible for helping start a flood of corporate 
takeovers that reshaped corporate america in the 1980s 
once the yard is going again said durand id be glad to 
shake his hand

the threat of sanctions under a new us trade law 
has pushed some asian countries to speed up market opening 
measures but also has unleashed counterthreats and claims that the 
united states itself isnt a fair trader 
asian countries lead the list of 34 nations that us trade 
representative carla hills in a recent report said have erected 
substantial trade barriers against us products 
the report was the first step in naming countries washington 
will target for intensive negotiations aimed at eliminating the 
trade barriers a decision on the final list is expected may 30 
japan headed the list of alleged trade offenders followed by 
south korea taiwan india and malaysia other asian countries 
named in the report included china indonesia pakistan the 
philippines and thailand 
for decades japan south korea and taiwan relied on exports to 
the united states to fuel their growth into industrial powerhouses 
if they do not reciprocate by opening their markets to usmade 
goods under the 1988 omnibus trade act they face possible 
retaliation in the form of up to 100 percent tariffs on selected 
imports 
the united states either must increase exports to asia or slash 
its imports from the region in order to substantially cut its trade 
deficit 
over twothirds of the 13734 billion us trade deficit in 
1988 was with asian countries acccording to us figures 
americas largest trade imbalance was a 554 billion deficit with 
japan 
the us trade representatives report singles out 32 japanese 
barriers to foreign imports including rice supercomputers 
semiconductors telecommunications and tobacco 
japanese officials have responded to the new trade law by 
threating to challenge us sanctions under the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade the international trade body 
japan can never accept unilateral actions of the us and 
would seek mediation under gatt japanese economic counselor 
nobutoshi akao said 
tokyo stopped short of such action in 1987 when thenpresident 
reagan ordered 300 million in annual us penalties against 
japanese electronics products for alleged violation of a 1986 
agreement on semiconductor trade part of the sanctions have since 
been lifted 
many japanese feel their country has done a lot to open its 
markets to foreign products and that the united states has not 
tried hard enough to sell highquality products in japan 
some japanese officials also are angered by us handling of a 
recent agreement to jointly produce japans next fighter jet us 
congressmen demanded a renegotiation of the pact charging tokyo 
was using it to acquire us technology even though it had hoped 
to develop the plane alone 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe told a press briefing 
thursday that listing japan as a serious free trade violator could 
provoke a strong emotional reaction among the japanese 
in some asian nations there was little or no public response to 
the ustr report but the reaction in taiwan and south korea was 
bitter 
fearing a strong antiamerican backlash south korea dispatched 
top economic officials to washington for talks about alleged trade 
barriers on agricultural products telecommunications government 
procurement and financial services 
south korea agreed on a new set of import liberalization 
measures that officials hoped would prevent penalty sanctions the 
agreement did not include farm imports 
us retaliation would be seen by the public as too harsh 
said deputy prime minister soon cho im sure it would be adding 
to instability from which the korean government is already 
suffering 
there have been sporadic violent clashes between police and 
farmers in korea in recent years as the government gradually opened 
its markets to imports of wine cigarettes beef and other 
products antiamerican sentiment has grown fueled by a 
dissidentled campaign against us trade pressure 
seoul also has threatened to file complaints with gatt and has 
refused further devaluation of its currency the won a weaker won 
makes south korean products less competitive in overseas markets 
the united states has accused south korea and taiwan of 
manipulating their exchange rates to boost their trade surpluses 
although us treasury secretary nicholas brady said earlier this 
month that taiwan has made progress in that area 
the ustr report charges taiwan with unfair import licensing 
farm subsidies and ineffective protection of intellectual property 
rights 
taiwanese officials responded they had done much to liberalize 
the local market and narrow the nations trade gap with the united 
states 
it is extremely unfair to include us in the report said 
vincent siew vice chairman of the governments council for 
economic planning and development 
in march taiwan presented a fouryear timetable for reducing 
its us trade surplus by at least 10 percent annually the surplus 
totaled 104 billion last year down 35 percent from 1987 
in april taiwan announced tariff cuts on hundreds of items and 
said it would revise laws on insurance and banking and crack down 
on pirate videos it has refused however to further open its 
agricultural market saying it must protect local farmers 
india charged with unfair import policies export subsidies and 
poor protection of intellectual property rights countered by 
saying the us threats violate gatt rules 
commerce minister dinesh singh called the 1988 trade act unfair 
and said india would pursue the issue to protect its interests 
thailand and malaysia also objected to the threat of us trade 
sanctions 
bangkok which enjoyed a 14 billion surplus with the united 
states in 1988 is under fire for inadequate protection of us 
pharmaceutical patents it asked for more time to deal with the 
problem and in turn accused washington of unfair farm subsidies 
a foreign ministry official who demanded anonymity said thailand 
had its own complaints against us agriculture subsidies the 
americans are subsidizing their 11000 rice farmers by up to 1 
billion a year whereas thailand has millions of rice farmers who 
are very poor and cannot sell their rice because of subsidies he 
said 
in malaysia the progovernment new straits times also 
criticized the us accusations of unfair trade barriers in 
agricultural products especially palm oil malaysias main export 
to the united states 
malaysia posted a 17 billion trade surplus with the united 
states last year
