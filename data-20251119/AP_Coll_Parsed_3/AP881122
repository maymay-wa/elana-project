president reagan has given recess 
appointments to about 30 people to maintain continuity in various 
agencies boards and commissions while congress is in recess press 
spokesmen said tuesday 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said names of most of the 
candidates for the posts had been submitted to congress earlier but 
had not been confirmed by the time adjournment came on oct 23 
fitzwater also said that reagan administration cabinet officers 
and agency heads had been asked to provide the bush transition team 
with information on issues facing their agencies 
briefing reporters who accompanied reagan to southern california 
for the presidents sixday vacation fitzwater said the bush team 
was seeking information of a routine nature including 
department and agency organizational charts missions and 
chainsofcommand 
fitzwater said that white house chief of staff kenneth 
duberstein who also is the head of reagans transition team asked 
that the information be provided to the bush people no later than 
friday 
noting that toplevel executive branch political appointees had 
been asked earlier to offer resignation letters to give bush more 
hiring flexibility fitzwater said i dont interpret this as any 
kind of hit list or any special effort to weed out people or 
anything like that it simply is a routine description of jobs 
functions people etc 
as for the recess appointees he said with the exception of 
the few people that are being appointed to fixedterm positions all 
are being asked to submit their resignations with their 
appointments 
he said the appointments were necessary because in some cases 
we have boards and commissions and so forth that need people in them 
so they have a quorum in other cases they fill positions that 
have decisions coming up in the next few months and we feel that 
they should be filled 
among the 32 recess appointments announced tuesday were these 
william andreas brown former ambassador to thailand to succeed 
thomas r pickering as the us envoy to israel 
margot e machol to be a commissioner on the federal trade 
commission 
jill houghton emery to be director of the womens bureau at the

a man who startled observers by carrying a 
starter pistol to a preelection campaign rally for vice president 
george bush was indicted tuesday on disorderly conduct charges 
a federal grand jury brought the charges against john arthur 
junot 40 of los angeles who was arrested nov 6 and charged with 
disorderly conduct under state law 
junot was about 50 yards away from the vice president who was 
addressing a suburban los angeles crowd of about 10000 on gun 
control when the gun fell to the ground he fled as bystanders 
yelled he had a weapon and police arrested him moments later 
there was no indication bush even noticed the incident 
evidence showed junot planned several weeks in advance of the 
bush rally to take the pistol said assistant us attorney julie 
blackshaw among the evidence was a poem allegedly written by junot 
for john hinckley the man who shot president reagan 
police said the starter pistol was the type normally used at 
track and field events and resembles a handgun although it fires 
only blanks 
junot faces up to six months in prison and a 5000 fine if

blacks are angry that the state is 
considering a january parole hearing for the man convicted of 
killing the rev martin luther king jr the head of a black 
political organization said monday 
the hearing was announced last week for james earl ray 60 
serving 99 years for assassinating king in memphis on april 4 1968 
meanwhile ray said in an interview for the morton downey jr 
show that he was coerced by the fbi into pleading guilty to cover 
up a government conspiracy the interview released monday is 
believed to be rays first television interview since 1975 said 
bill boggs the shows executive producer 
under a 1985 law providing parole hearings for longterm 
prisoners after 20 years ray became eligible for parole 
consideration this month 
the law was designed to allow the state to relieve overcrowding 
of the prison system a federal court has ordered the state to 
upgrade the system and 3500 cells are planned including three 
maximumsecurity prisons 
james m brown of pulaski chairman of the tennessee voters 
council and a member of the dr martin luther king jr state holiday 
committee called the parole hearing for ray cruel dangerous and 
shameful and said he would ask gov ned mcwherter to call it off 
he noted the hearing in january would coincide with the jan 16 
holiday honoring the civil rights leaders birthday 
brown said tennesseans were told that ray would not be eligible 
for release until the next century because of the early parole 
hearing brown said black people across this state are mad as 
hell its an insult to all black people to even consider such a 
thing 
mcwherter said he could not call the hearing off since the board 
is independent of him but said he agreed that the projected hearing 
was a disgrace to all the citizens of tennessee i would urge the 
board not to consider a parole for ray 
however he said he would not interfere with the boards decision 
the chairman of the state parole board charles traughber who is 
black said the board simply was following the law the hearing was 
delayed until january to give the board a chance to gather 
information on rays prison record as well as his psychological 
evaluation 
ray twice tried to escape from prison including a briefly 
successful breakout in 1977 in 1982 he was stabbed 22 times by 
other inmates at brushy mountain state prison in eastern tennessee 
and transferred to a different prison 
ray who pleaded guilty on the day his trial was to begin on 
march 9 1969 recanted three days later but never has been able to 
get a fullblown trial to back up his contention that he was 
innocent 
i doubt very much theyll give me a parole ray told a 
reporter i think the only way ill get out of here is through a 
jury if they wouldnt grant me a trial i dont see how theyll 
grant me a parole 
in the interview to be broadcast next monday on the syndicated 
television program ray claimed the government has withheld evidence 
in his case to conceal its connection to the assassination 
he alleges the fbi threatened to jail his father and brother if 
he didnt sign a confession rays father was a fugitive from prison 
and his brother spent several years in jail 
ray said two men who later disappeared had been with him in 
memphis when king was killed ray said the men were fbi agents 
assigned to set up a white southerner as the murderer rays claims 
have not been substantiated 
mark lane a lawyer who has studied the assassination said 
during the taped program that the congressional committee 
investigating the death was pressured by the government to withhold 
information 
lane said committee chairman walter fauntroy the district of 
columbia delegate had told him he believed the fbi killed king 
fauntroy was not at his washington home monday night for 
immediate comment said a person who answered his telephone

the new jersey symphony orchestra crossed the 
hudson to carnegie hall and showed the nations cultural capital it 
has the right to escape the label of geographical filler between the 
new york philharmonic and philadelphia orchestra 
under music director hugh wolff in his fourth season the group 
is polished and assured not to mention solvent and musically 
stable though it still plays in a halfdozen leaky concert halls 
around new jersey without a permanent home gone are the days of 
nearbankruptcy and cancelled seasons 
monday nights concert subtitled music turns the century 
featured three works composed in the 1890s richard strausss don 
quixote claude debussys prelude to the afternoon of a faun 
and charles ives symphony no 2 the idea is part of wolffs attempt 
to give the orchestra a strong identity and to concertgoers used 
to new yorks musical riches a reason to buy tickets 
the idea worked on one count the pieces nicely complemented each 
other and featured the orchestra in two ways they put its 
firstchair players on display in the debussy and strauss and 
showed how well the orchestra played as one instrument in the ives 
but carnegie was only about twothirds full 
don quixote a tone poem subtitled fantastic variations on 
a knightly theme portrays the adventures of cervantes don 
through music musical variations evoke events in the novel such as 
the dons encounter with a flock of sheep and magical ride through 
the air on a wooden horse 
the busy and prizewinning solo cellist carter brey played a 
polished and vivid don quixote and first violist frank foerster was 
an effectively scampering and lyric sancho panza 
written while strauss was working on a heros life don 
quixote has a sense of parody and wry commentary on the knights 
walter mitty adventures but the music also shows his nobility 
brey captured all that he played with humor and personality not 
afraid of frequent portamento including one long pathetic slide at 
the end to signify quixotes death in passages with first desk 
strings he looked directly at his colleagues and played chamber 
music 
often the brass and winds seemed to overpower the strings 
particularly first violins and on the other extreme when big 
effects were called for such as the sharp loud chords before the 
cello entrance in the introduction or the climactic moments of 
battle scenes in the later variations one wanted wolff to let 
loose just a little bit more 
the debussy a meditation on a work of french poet stephane 
mallarme was nicely shaped by the 36yearold conductor with wind 
solos growing out of each other and subtle volume changes but wolff 
did not step into the sublime his ritards were adequate the 
strings shimmered only modestly 
but it was a nice transition to the ives perhaps the connecticut 
insurance executives most accessible symphony written when he was 
in his 20s the piece has constant snatches of americana 
columbia the gem of the ocean america the beautiful 
camptown races as well as bits from brahms dvorak and 
beethoven 
here the orchestra sounded more integrated and also produced one 
of the most beautiful moments of the evening the serene opening 
section strings alone of the first movement wolff shaped the 
lines well spurring them on at the right moments 
the orchestra played with suitable passion in the brahmsian 
fourth movement and the strings showed agility in the last 
movement which ended in a monumentally discordant blast after a 
seemingly conventional buildup only then did the orchestra show the 
power it seems to be capable of

unrest sparked by ethnic tensions and 
a political drive to jolt yugoslavia out of economic torpor has 
produced very different demonstrations in the developing south and 
more affluent north 
in the south protests continued for a fifth straight day monday 
over the forced resignations of two leaders from the ethnic albanian 
majority in the troubled province of kosovo 
at least 7000 people defied threats of a crackdown on the 
biggest wave of demonstrations since world war ii in the province 
that borders albania they trudged 40 miles from two towns to the 
provincial capital of pristina and dispersed only after repeated 
appeals 
in the liberal northern republic of slovenia about 13000 people 
gathered in driving snow to demand the acquittal of four men 
sentenced to jail last summer for making public a classified 
military document 
the rallies in the capital ljubljana and in nearby celje also 
demanded an unprecedented republicwide referendum on changes to the 
yugoslav constitution due to be passed next week by the communist 
leaderships of the countrys six republics 
many slovenians fear the changes will curb the slow process of 
democratization in their prosperous westwardlooking republic by 
giving more power to federal authorities 
communist authorities say the amendments to yugoslavias clumsy 
1974 constitution are needed so marketoriented economic reforms can 
be implemented yugoslavia is beset by 236 percent annual inflation 
and 15 percent unemployment 
slobodan milosevic communist party leader in the largest 
republic of serbia is trying to use the constitutional changes to 
get more control over serbias semiautonomous provinces of kosovo 
and vojvodina 
his drive over kosovo fanned by allegations of ethnic albanian 
harassment of the provinces serb minority has rallied hundreds of 
thousands of serbs behind his cause 
but kosovos ethnic albanians have resisted the drive to curb the 
autonomy they won under the 1974 constitution 
last weeks resignations of azem vlasi and kacusa jasari both 
members of kosovs 13member ruling politburo appear to have been 
the spark that drove ethnic albanians into the streets for the first 
time since 1981 when at least nine people died in clashes 
the two stepped down under pressure from milosevic who wants 
greater control over kosovo for serbia and as many as 100000 
ethnic albanians took to the streets of pristina over the weekend 
demanding they be reinstated 
after warnings emergency measures would be imposed if unrest did 
not cease the demonstrations became much smaller but another 4000 
people rallied sunday and at least 7000 demonstrated on monday 
under the proposed constitutional amendments milosevic wants to 
restore serbian control over kosovos judiciary education and 
policing communist leaders in yugoslavias other republics see his 
campaign as a drive to increase the influence of serbia on the loose 
yugoslav federation 
but milosevic claims the changes would only put serbia on an 
equal footing with other republics which have no administrative 
provinces like kosovo and vojvodina 
one of mondays rallies dispersed after a surprise speech by a 
serbian factory worker from the kosovan town of orohavac which is 
about 260 miles from belgrade 
the worker ruzica isma flew in the face of widespread serbian 
allegations of ethnic albanian harassment saying she had never 
experienced such 
wildly cheered by flagwaving chanting ethnic albanians she 
declared we will not let anyone impose constitutional changes 
that people dont want as long as there is a contest we will 
assemble like this every day day and night rain or snow 
yugoslavia a nation of 23 million split from the soviet bloc in 
1948

the specter of reykjavik is hanging over the 
scheduled meeting between presidentelect george bush and kremlin 
leader mikhail gorbachev in new york on dec 7 
bush said monday he does not want the session to turn into an 
anythinggoes bargaining session although his aides say they will 
be going with open ears and minds 
the reagan administration took the same approach before an 
october 1986 meeting in reykjavik iceland between between 
president reagan and gorbachev billed in advance by the americans 
as a nonsummit 
in reykjavik however gorbachev engaged reagan in bargaining 
over the eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons that prospect 
upset us allies in western europe who rely on american nuclear 
deterrence and who complained they had not been fully consulted on 
an arms cut as broad as reagan was considering 
after reykjavik the reagan administration tried to match 
gorbachevs diplomatic pace signing a treaty to eliminate some 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons and making progress toward a 
strategic arms reduction treaty start 
gorbachev will probably try to pressure bush to match that pace 
bush told a news conference monday that the new york session with 
gorbachev will not be the first bushgorbachev summit but will be 
president reagans meeting 
ill be there as vice president of the united states and i 
expect theyll be aware theyre talking to the next president he 
said 
in terms of specificity in terms of my committing a brand new 
administration to specifics in arms control or anything else im 
not going to do that said bush 
but said one bush aide we expect gorbachev to try to advance 
some of his ideas and given his record he may unveil some new 
ones right at the meeting 
we dont want this to turn into a summit but we will be 
listening said the aide who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the bush team thinks gorbachev might try to break new ground in 
start and in efforts to cut eastwest conventional or nonnuclear 
forces in europe 
gorbachev may restate his desire for soviet participation in a 
proposed middle east peace conference perhaps trying a new twist in 
the wake of a declaration of a palestinian homeland by the 
parliament of the palestine liberation organization 
the bush camp believes gorbachev will restate the soviet intent 
to withdraw its remaining troops from afghanistan although they 
have halted that withdrawal to protest renewed offensives by afghan 
guerrillas 
we think they just want to get out without being humiliated 
said the bush aide 
conventional and strategic arms control are considered the most 
likely areas for a gorbachev diplomatic initiative 
gorbachev and other soviets have been talking for more than a 
year about a new military doctrine of reasonable sufficiency 
which could entail sharp cuts in warsaw pact conventional forces 
so far there has been no change in the deployment of 
conventional warsaw pact forces and soviet chief of staff sergei 
akhromeyev said during a pentagon visit last summer that moscow 
would cut back only if washington did likewise 
but that doesnt mean that gorbachev wont make a new proposal 
on conventional arms he knows it plays well in west europe said 
the bush aide 
gorbachev might also try to resolve disagreements that remained 
after the moscow summit last june over mobile missiles 
submarinelaunched cruise missiles and limits to space tests of 
antimissile defenses 
the dispute over reagans strategic defense initiative is the 
most emotional obstacle to start gorbachev insists the united 
states agree to abide for another decade by the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty which bars space defenses 
for its part the united states insists mobile missiles be banned 
under start the soviet union has deployed two mobile missiles the 
10warhead ss25 based on rails and the singlewarhead ss24 
based on trucks america is devising but has not deployed a 
railmobile system for the 10warhead mx and is developing the 
singlewarhead roadmobile midgetman 
the soviets in turn are insisting on strict limits for 
submarinelaunched nucleartipped cruise missiles but the reagan 
administration has balked at the stringent verification procedures 
that would be needed

the judge in the irancontra case says 
president reagan should consider the various courses of action he 
may take to stop the trial of oliver l north to prevent national 
security secrets from being disclosed 
us district judge gerhard a gesell did not say that reagan 
should consider pardoning the four irancontra defendants but 
suggested other means by which the trial could be stopped 
he said that under the classified information procedures act 
reagan could declare that the danger of disclosing highly sensitive 
government secrets was so great that the charges must be dropped 
the president as the nations chief law enforcement officer could 
either directly order the case dropped or he could invoke secrecy 
laws to prevent disclosure of classified information which could 
have the same effect 
the constitution does not permit the court to take this 
testimony in secret as did the congress it must be public 
gesell said adding he would have very little control over the 
content of the testimony 
accordingly if on analysis this imminent prospect gives ground 
for presidential action to protect any perceived threat to the 
foreign policy obligations which the president has or the 
intelligence needs of the country the constitution and the statutes 
provide various courses of action he may take the judge said 
reagan meanwhile reiterated previous statements he had made on 
the question when asked whether he would pardon north 
no and i dont think its time for that while its in the 
courts reagan said at a groundbreaking ceremony for his 
presidential library at simi valley calif 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president 
believes the legal process should take its course the president is 
not considering a pardon 
a senior administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said we are fully aware that some documents and 
evidence in the case pose significant security risks when a 
reporter suggested the white house was attempting to throw the 
decision back to gesell the official did not disagree 
the testimony of current or former government officials 
acquainted with high security matters poses a difficult 
situation for those who may have foreign policy or national security 
concerns gesell said at the hearing 
these prosecution witnesses who include former national security 
adviser robert mcfarlane will be subjected to intense 
crossexamination by norths lawyers the judge said 
the defense will be granted wide latitude to question these 
witnesses about their motives for testifying against the former 
national security council aide 
gesell said such questioning might involve sensitive events 
other than events relevant under the indictment 
gesell in urging reagan to focus on the secrecy issue said the 
case was rapidly approaching trial probably by late january 
the judge made the comments at the conclusion of a twohour 
hearing on norths motions to dismiss the central conspiracy charges 
against him and his three codefendants former national security 
adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and richard 
v secord 
separate trials have been ordered for each defendant 
gesell indicated that he wouldnt dismiss the charge that all 
four defendants conspired to defraud the government by setting up 
the secret armssupply network for the nicaraguan rebels and 
diverted usiran armssale proceeds to finance the insurgents 
known as contras 
gesell said defense lawyers could not legally wrap themselves 
in the presidents cloak unless it appeared that the president 
directed the diversion of funds to the contras and the obstruction 
of inquiries into the matter 
but he suggested that two other charges that the defendants stole 
government property and committed wire fraud needlessly duplicated 
the conspiracy count 
he also expressed skepticism about whether prosecutors could 
prove the defendants embezzled profits from the armsforhostage 
sales saying you dont know where the money went you cant trace 
the money 
the money did go in large part to the contras said bruce a 
green an associate independent counsel what we are alleging is 
that money went in large part for other purposes not authorized 
when reagan approved the arms sales 
the judge rebuked the justice department for its 
friendofthecourt brief challenging independent counsel lawrence 
e walshs theory that north could be prosecuted for obstructing 
congressional oversight of foreign policy 
the justice department invoking the separationofpower 
doctrine said walsh had overstated congress role in foreign 
affairs which it said was primarily a presidential function 
gesell said reagans authorization of norths prosecution refutes 
the departments suggestion that independent counsel is acting in 
disregard of the presidents primary responsibility for the conduct 
of foreign affairs and protection of national security

dan quayle is not the intellectual midget 
portrayed by the news media says former president richard m nixon 
when the vice presidentelect and the man who also was vice 
president for eight years talked for the first time on monday they 
discussed ussoviet relations arms control negotiations between 
the two superpowers and the role of the vice presidency 
after the meeting nixon pronounced quayle a man of intelligence 
and dedication and said hell be an excellent vice president 
i was very surprised he is a very different man from the 
intellectual midget who has been portrayed among the media nixon 
told reporters at an impromptu news conference 
he said the two had met before but this is the first time i had 
a chance to have a talk with senator quayle 
this is a man who has strong views hes highly intelligent 
hes highly dedicated nixon said 
during their meeting which lasted just over 90 minutes nixon 
advised quayle on the vice presidency a post nixon held from 1953 
to 1961 under former president dwight d eisenhower 
nixon was elected president in 1968 serving until his 
resignation in august 1974 in the wake of the watergate scandal 
the important thing for the vice president is to recognize that 
his responsibility is to serve the interest of the country and 
that means to serve the interest of the president nixon said 
the advice he gave to quayle was to follow the example of 
george bush hes been a very successful vice president and its 
important that you follow his example in your handling of the 
position 
nixon refused to provide details of their foreign policy 
discussion but said he and quayle happen to share views that 
are frankly a little inconsistent with some of the conventional 
wisdom with regard to sovietamerican relations 
in september quayle questioned recent soviet reforms saying 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev wasnt very different from former 
kremlin leader leonid brezhnev and suggested that perestroika is 
nothing more than refined stalinism 
nixon who chose not to define his views did urge the new 
administration to develop a diplomatic offensive to counter the 
diplomatic offensive of gorbachev 
the former president said he was confident that bush would 
succeed in arms control negotiations with the soviets and also had 
praise for quayle in that area 
at the present time i cannot think of six other senators who 
know as much about the complexities of arms control as senator dan 
quayle nixon said he will be a great asset to the 
administration on this very important subject when it is considered 
during the next administration 
nixon also applauded bushs recent administration appointments 
including the selection of new hampshire gov john sununu as white 
house chief of staff 
as i look at him hes highly intelligent hes very tough 
nixon said of sununu i think hes going to break some china but 
hes a shrewd enough politician that hell know how to put the china 
together again

a congressional agency says the next major farm 
bill should provide for flexible control of crop production so that 
farmers can respond more readily to market opportunities 
in one of a series of reports about issues in the forthcoming 
bush administration the general accounting agency said the 1990 
farm bill needs to retain the authority of the agriculture 
department to influence crop production in times of surplus and 
scarcity 
but the gao an investigative arm of congress said the current 
farm law enacted in 1985 has had a number of shortcomings 
the law has helped us agriculture to become more competitive in 
the world market while maintaining farm income the report said 
this success however has come at a cost much higher than that 
of previous farm bills the gao said between fiscal years 1986 
and 1988 farm price and income support programs averaged over 20 
billion annually 
farm programs should be designed to prevent the accumulation of 
unneeded surpluses and still hold down the usdas costs of 
operating them the report said 
according to usda budget figures spending on farm commodity 
supports soared to a record 258 billion in fiscal 1986 the first 
year of operation under the 1985 law but have declined since then 
the 1985 farm bill moved farm programs in a more 
marketoriented direction the gao said however rigidities in 
the bills production control provisions have discouraged farmers 
from producing certain crops even when commercial market conditions 
are favorable 
for example it said the programs this year affected decisions 
of farmers in the corn belt who maintained their level of corn 
plantings and did not expand their soybeans despite a strong soybean 
market relative to corn 
increases in soybean acres may have improved market returns for 
agriculture and tempered production expansion by foreign producers 
who compete with us farmers in world markets the report said 
congress modified the law this year in response to the drought to 
allow soybeans to be planted on corn acres in 1989 without farmers 
losing future benefits under the corn program 
the 1990 farm bill debate should focus on such alternatives 
that retain usdas ability to influence crop production but provide 
more flexibility to respond to market opportunities the report 
said 
gao boss charles a bowsher said that other concerns lawmakers 
should address include 
reducing the cost of farmers home administration loan programs 
finding longterm ways of reducing dairy surpluses 
strengthening the viability of the usdas federal crop insurance 
program 
enhancing us agricultural competitiveness in world markets 
improving the delivery of food stamp benefits to lowincome 
families

one by one former peace corps volunteers from 
across the nation stood in the vaulted capitol rotunda and reflected 
on how john f kennedy slain 25 years ago today had changed 
their lives with his summons to serve the needy overseas 
during a 24hour vigil in the same great hall where the 
presidents body lay in state for a desolate day and night in 
november 1963 about 500 volunteers paid tribute to kennedys memory 
with brief speeches songs and readings from their journals and 
letters written from strange lands 
ruth pearsall of frankfort mich led three generations of peace 
corps volunteers in her family to take part in the vigil herself 
daughter virginia kirkwood and grandnephew craig hendricks 
helen clarke of honolulu and linda frye of pennsburg pa both 
77 swapped stories about their adventures as widows embarking on 
new lives in india and venezuela in the mid1960s 
one of the most emotionally charged moments of the vigil came 
when john f murphy jr a hartford conn lawyer read a letter he 
wrote in july 1969 to the mother of a former peace corps buddy who 
was killed the vietnam war 
murphy recalled that after he and john morascini had built a 
schoolhouse together in gabon in west africa in the early 1960s 
morascini built a playground and planned a carnival where villagers 
could celebrate 
do not remember john for the medal which they may send or even 
for the flag which they have given you murphy wrote morascinis 
mother 
i will remember john as one who really did bring some peace to 
the world he brought peace not as a sergeant in the us army but 
as a young boy who once had an idea that it might be a good thing to 
build a playground 
said katy hansen of orange city iowa who taught in a nigerian 
high school in 196768 we are here to rejoice in a life 
welllived and not to mourn a life that has passed away this is a 
celebration of life 
today ms hansen is president of the national council of 
returned peace corps volunteers and vice chairman of the sioux 
county democratic party she says she tries to keep the kennedy 
spirit alive by helping save iowas family farmers from ruin 
the vigil is ending at noon today with remarks by sens 
christopher dodd dconn himself a former volunteer in the 
dominican republic in 196668 and television commentator bill 
moyers the agencys first deputy director 
a commemorative service will be held afterward at st matthews 
roman catholic cathedral where kennedys funeral service was held 
on nov 25 1963 officiating will be the rev theodore hesburgh 
who was first chairman of the peace corps advisory committee 
altogether an estimated 130000 former volunteers and staff have 
served in 95 countries since kennedy founded the peace corps in 
march 1961 as his first major initiative as president today 6000 
volunteers are working in 65 countries and the agency says it 
expects to have 10000 abroad by the early 1990s 
rep tom petri rwis one of six house members who are former

involved with the world not just as diplomats or the military but 
as citizens

the postcolonial government codify its laws other former

in just two months as the first hispanic to 
serve in the cabinet education secretary lauro f cavazos has 
extended an olive branch to teacher unions and other groups that 
bitterly opposed reagan administration education policies 
cavazos predecessor william j bennett often blamed those 
groups for many of the troubles ailing us schools 
after presidentelect george bush announced monday that he was 
keeping cavazos the education secretary said there is much to be 
done we will continue our thrust in the directions weve moved in 
already and we will have the clear mandate from our department to 
educate every person in america to their fullest potential 
at his first news conference as secretary two months ago cavazos 
said i really bring no agenda other than to try to advance 
education in america were all on the side of the angels 
mary futrell president of the national education association 
hailed bushs action 
this reappointment is a hopeful sign that mr bush will fulfill 
his campaign promise to become the education president she 
said adding that during his two months in reagans cabinet cavazos 
has brought a new atmosphere of good will and cooperation that was 
clearly lacking under his predecessor 
some of the same qualities that have won cavazos praise from the 
nea and other education groups have raised hackles among 
conservatives who fear cavazos is too liberal for their tastes 
for cavazos 61 the son of a foreman on the king ranch in texas 
education has been the pathway to repeated success first as a 
physiology phd and professor later as dean of the tufts 
university school of medicine and from 1980 until recently as 
president of his alma mater texas tech university 
now he faces the challenge of trying to sustain and expand the 
reform movement that has reverberated through american education 
since april 1983 when a panel of reagan administration advisers 
warned of a rising tide of mediocrity engulfing us schools 
cavazos began his own education in a oneroom schoolhouse on the 
800000acre king ranch with other hispanic children of ranch hands 
when he was ready to start third grade his family moved to the town 
of kingsville texas where he became the first hispanic child to 
enroll in the local school 
his father stressed the importance of education to all his 
children one became a fourstar army general another won honors as 
a college football running back and now owns his own ranch 
cavazos enlisted in the army upon graduation from high school and 
was contemplating a career as a commercial fisherman when he was 
discharged his father vetoed that idea and took him to enroll 
instead at texas tech 
i am convinced education is the key to many things cavazos 
said when reagan nominated him if you have sufficient education 
you can solve almost any problem in the world famine ecological 
problems nuclear problems racism theyre all solved with 
education 
he met his wife peggy a registered nurse at texas tech they 
married 33 years ago and have 10 children seven of them texas tech 
graduates including a physician an architect a teacher and two 
pilots 
cavazos has voted democratic in past elections and angered some 
conservatives by refusing to record a blanket endorsement ad for 
republican congressional candidates but he did campaign across the 
southwest for bush who is a fellow texan and old friend 
cavazos has called himself a very very strong advocate of 
bilingual education but my goal is to make the person competent as 
quickly as possible in english 
bennett waged a successful fight to persuade congress to allow 25 
percent of bilingual education funds to be spent on englishonly 
immersion programs 
cavazos at his initial news conference sept 21 offered a plea 
in spanish to the millions of children growing up like he did 
speaking that language por favor ninos no dejen la escuela 
please children dont leave school 
bush said monday he wants cavazos to help find ways to make 
college more affordable to reward outstanding teachers to spur 
alternate certification of teachers and establish magnet and 
merit schools 
bush also said he favors vouchers and believes parental choice 
is the optimum thing to encourage excellence in education 
while bush has promised to launch a 500 million merit school 
program to reward schools that achieve top results with 
disadvantaged students many other programs in the 21 billion 
education department budget could be under pressure from bushs 
flexible freeze proposal 
as texas tech president cavazos spoke out against reagan efforts 
to cut grants and loans for college students

alpha interferon a natural disease fighter 
already used to treat leukemia can now be used to battle kaposis 
sarcoma a cancer that primarily attacks aids patients 
the food and drug administration announced monday that alpha 
interferon was shown in tests to be effective against kaposis and 
now is approved for treatment of the cancer that has become common 
among aids victims 
alpha interferon is a diseasefighter that is present in the body 
naturally in small amounts but has been artifically produced in 
large quantities in recent years through the use of genesplicing 
techniques it previously had been approved for treatment of 
hairycell leukemia and for genital warts 
frank e young fda commissioner said approval of the manmade 
alpha interferon shows biotechnologys emerging role in helping 
modern medicine fight some of the most serious diseases which plague 
mankind 
kaposis sarcoma named for a european doctor who first described 
it more than 100 years ago was a rare cancer until the appearance 
early in this decade of aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the cancer causes purple or brown lesions on the skin and can 
attack the lungs brain and gastrointestinal tract kaposis can 
cause death when it attacks the lungs or other vital organs 
although most aids patients die of other causes 
alpha interferon was used experimentally to treat kaposis in a 
number of studies including some conducted at the national 
institute of allergy and infectious diseases part of the national 
institutes of health 
anthony s fauci the niaid director said that studies by h 
clifford lane of the niaid demonstrated that alpha interferon was 
an effective antikaposis sarcoma agent in patients who were in 
the early stages of the aids infection 
according to the fda several human studies showed that high 
doses of alpha inteferon would reduce kaposis tumors in 40 to 45 
percent of patients who were in early stages of the aids infection 
aids patients who were helped most were those whose blood showed 
a t4helper cell count of above 200 per square centimeter and who 
have not experienced other opportunistic infections t4helper cells 
are part of the bodys immune system and are attacked by the aids 
virus healthy people have a t4helper cell count of 800 to 1000 
those with more advanced aids tend to have t4helper cell counts 
below 200 and do not benefit from the alpha interferon treatment 
alpha interferon was first identified in 1957 as a hormonelike 
protein that is a natural diseasefighting component of the blood 
in the early 1980s researchers were able to insert the gene coded 
for alpha interferon into a bacteria which then produces the protein 
in large quantities this is the technique called genesplicing 
the fda said that alpha interferon is marketed by schering corp 
of kenilworth nj under the brand name introna and by 
hoffmannla roche of nutley nj under the brand name roferon both 
products were first approved in 1986 for the treatment of hairycell 
leukemia and last june for the treatment of genital warts 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections the virus most often is spread through contact with 
blood blood products or semen from infected persons aids is 
incurable and fatal 
as of nov 7 aids had been diagnosed in 77994 americans of 
whom more than half or 43888 have died since june 1 1981 
according to the government

attorney general dick thornburgh who has been 
allaying conservative concerns over his tenure now plans to reach 
out to civil rights leaders who have been criticizing the reagan 
administration for eight years 
after presidentelect george bush announced monday that he 
intended to retain him thornburgh signaled that he seeks to reopen 
lines of communication to civil rights groups administration 
relations with such groups have deteriorated because of its 
opposition to affirmative action hiring and promotion courtordered 
school desegregation and other programs 
in the civil rights area the vice president has indicated a 
desire to reach out to groups that may feel disaffected from the 
process thornburgh told reporters i have a long history of 
working effectively with leadership of the civil rights groups which 
i hope to continue 
in the coming weeks the attorney general will meet with the 
leadership conference on civil rights a coalition of 180 
organizations thornburgh knows the conferences executive director 
ralph neas who is spending several months at harvard universitys 
institute of politics which was formerly headed by thornburgh 
theres obviously some perception on the part of civil rights 
leaders that were not willing to listen and talk with and 
consider their views in framing the administrations views 
thornburgh said adding we want to dispel that 
he said theres certainly no conscious effort to change the 
basic civil rights agenda and he said were going to disagree 
but i think the importance of the effort were going to try to 
make is to establish a dialogue 
thornburghs and the bush administrations first important task 
in the area will be to find a replacement for the justice 
departments civil rights division chief william bradford reynolds 
who spearheaded the reagan administrations controversial policies 
thornburghs overtures to the civil rights community follow three 
months in which he has been watched closely by conservatives 
dick thornburgh has been very open to conservatives his staff 
has got good lines of communications to conservative leaders on the 
legal issues said dan casey executive director of the american 
conservative union 
a number of weeks ago casey singled out the thenimminent 
question of whether thornburgh would step into the abortion issue 
before the supreme court as a key test of how the attorney general 
would be regarded among conservative groups represented in his 
organization 
thornburgh was deeply involved in the solicitor generals 
decision to invite the supreme court to review the landmark ruling 
legalizing abortion 
the attorney generals track record to date has very much eased 
conservative fears about what he might be inclined to do as attorney 
general over the long haul said patrick korten a justice 
department spokesman under thornburghs predecessor edwin meese 
iii and now with the conservative heritage foundation 
shortly after coming to washington thornburgh had delivered a 
speech on ethics at the justice department that was viewed as being 
a thinly veiled reference to meese who had been under criminal 
investigation for 14 months before resigning in august also 
thornburgh made clear he had serious reservations about an order 
meese signed in his final day at the justice department setting 
forth procedures under which independent counsels could be appointed 
to investigate members of congress 
thornburgh still has reservations about the meese order but now 
says he wants to review the matter with the incoming bush 
administration before taking action 
in addition he persuaded president reagan to announce plans to 
veto a whistleblower protection bill passed by congress and argued 
before the supreme court in favor of a drug testing program 
thornburgh also defended the justice departments decision to 
file a brief attacking independent counsel lawrence walshs legal 
theory in the irancontra that former national security council aide 
oliver north obstructed congress foreign affairs authority 
when it was suggested the irancontra brief may have been filed 
to bolster his image among conservatives thornburgh told reporters 
thats absolute nonsense nobodys got to shore up dick 
thornburghs conservative credentials

a nearrecord amount of wheat will be needed to 
meet all us domestic and export commitments in 198889 despite a 
sharp rise in prices from last season says an agriculture 
department report 
about 265 billion bushels will be used down only about 5 
percent from the record use of 269 billion bushels in 198788 
over the entire marketing yearthat runs through next may 31 
wheat prices may average 355 to 385 per bushel up 40 to 50 
percent from the 198788 season 
demand should be strong despite higher prices because foreign 
and domestic food use of wheat is not very pricesensitive at 
least in the short term the departments economic research 
service said monday in its latest outlook report 
the price of wheat used for food in the united states responds 
little to changes in prices because wheat represents only a small 
portion of the total cost to the consumer of products made with 
flour the report said 
meanwhile world wheat export prices continue to edge higher 
because of tight supplies and relatively strong demand 
while the higher prices are rationing the available wheat among 
importers export subsidies credit availability and food aid 
programs are to some extent softening the impact of increased 
costs for countries that might otherwise have to further reduce 
purchases and consumption the report said 
even so total world wheat trade is expected to decline in 
198889 led by a sharp drop in imports by the soviet union and a 
decline in wheat sold as livestock feed

richard g darman presidentelect george 
bushs choice as his budget director is an aggressive veteran of 
two decades in the bureaucratic battles of washington who is known 
more for his efficiency than his modesty 
after darman moved into the white house as an assistant to the 
president in 1981 jim edwards an old harvard friend told a 
reporter he just has a natural feeling that hes superior to most 
people and deserves to be at a high policy level 
few deny that darman 45 is bright 
in the early days of the reagan administration james a baker 
iii then white house chief of staff said he was the guy more 
than anybody else who flagged the fact that we were going to have 
to come up with an additional round of cuts to handle the deficit 
problem 
when baker left the white house to become secretary of the 
treasury darman went with him as deputy secretary now baker is 
secretary of statedesignate and a key adviser to bush on 
appointments and other matters 
it was not the first time darman had hitched his wagon to a 
rising star in the washington firmament 
when he first came to washington in the nixon administration he 
went to work for what was then the department of health education 
and welfare where he caught the eye of secretary elliott richardson 
he followed richardson as an aide during the patrician boston 
lawyers stints at the departments of defense justice and commerce 
and in the law of the sea negotiations for the state department 
darman grew up in the affluent boston suburb of wellesley mass 
the son of an industrialist who owned textile mills and marketed oil 
and gas in new england 
after prep school where he was captain of the lacrosse team as 
well as editor of the literary journal he went on to harvard 
university harvard business school and washington 
then followed his years in the nixon and ford administrations 
after which he did corporate planning with a washington consulting 
firm and taught at harvards kennedy school of government 
when president reagan was elected in 1980 darman became a member 
of the white house transition team 
in recent remarks at a kennedy school conference in washington 
darman said he thought this team worked well because it was small 
and the people knew where they were going 
of the overall reagan transition effort involving more than 
1500 people he said if there has been a more colossal waste 
im not aware of it 
after the transition darman became assistant to the president 
and deputy to the chief of staff responsible for the flow of paper 
to the presidents desk 
hes the fourth most powerful person at the white house 
deputy chief of staff michael k deaver said at the time 
supporters lauded him as an extraordinarily bright and diligent 
organizer but detractors accused him of boundless ambition and ego 
darman resigned as deputy treasury secretary in april 1987 to 
take a job with shearson lehman brothers investment banking division 
at a salary with stock options that reportedly approached 1 
million annually 
this summer however he joined the bush campaign as a top 
adviser and served as the michael dukakis standin during bushs 
practice sessions before his two debates with the democratic 
challenger 
darman is married to the former kath emmett a phd who is 
writing a book about americans in paris after world war ii they

partial returns were used for bush dukakis and all the thirdparty 
candidates on the ballot in those states in two states alabama

dukakis 
the raw vote totals for all candidates should increase slightly 
when all returns are counted that is not expected until all states

health authorities are considering whether to 
immunize all newborns or children against hepatitis b a viral liver 
disease that is spread in the same manner as aids and is now posing 
a major health and economic threat 
harold margolis chief of the hepatitis branch at the centers for 
disease control said the incidence rate of hepatitis b in the 
united states is on a steep increase with about 300000 new cases a 
year and national treatment costs now about 1 million a day 
margolis spoke monday at a news conference sponsored by the 
national foundation for infectious diseases a nonprofit 
organization that promotes disease prevention 
sanford f kuvin an infectious disease expert who operates 
clinics in the united states and israel said hepatitis b is a 
national tragedy in incubation in the united states 
hepatitis is a viral disease that attacks the liver causing 
jaundice fatigue and loss of appetite hepatitis a is spread mostly 
through food and is generally a mild disease hepatitis b however 
is spread through an exchange of body fluids usually through sexual 
contact the sharing of iv drug needles or from birthing mother to 
child 
hepatitis b is thought to be the major cause of primary liver 
cancer and is thought to cause about 5000 deaths a year either 
directly or indirectly in the united states according to the 
foundation 
margolis said that between 6 percent and 10 percent of the 
hepatitis b cases become chronic in which symptoms are very slight 
but the carrier is able to spread the disease 
hepatitis b has a long incubation period several months but the 
serious effects of the disease such as cancer or liver failure may 
not appear for decades in chronic carriers 
there is a vaccine against hepatitis b but its use in the united 
states has been recommended only for healthcare workers and those 
at high risk the vaccine can prevent the disease but it cannot 
cure it once a patient is infected and the vaccine is expensive 
about 120 for the recommended threeshot series 
margolis said the centers for disease control has proposed that 
consideration be given to the universal use of the hepatitis b 
vaccine among newborn infants or among children but he said a 
program of vaccination among the young would not have a noticable 
effect on the spread of hepatitis b for 10 to 30 years 
kuvin said he believed the threat of the disease could be 
controlled with the vaccine but that since the innoculation became 
available in 1982 it has not been widely used 
unless it becomes utilized we are in for a serious national 
tragedy said kuvin 
the number of us hepatitis b cases has increased from 200000 
in 1978 to about 300000 in 1988 he said on a global basis the 
problem is even more severe there are an estimated 300 million 
cases worldwide kuvin said and an estimated 15 million of the 
babies born this year will die eventually of the disease or its 
complications 
the foundation is sponsoring a twoday conference on aids or 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and hepatitis b

authorities on monday identified one of the 
seven bodies found buried outside a boardinghouse but the coroner 
said he has not yet determined how any of the victims died 
county coroner charles simmons said the body of benjamin fink 
60 a former resident of dorothea puentes victorian boardinghouse 
in downtown sacramento was identified through fingerprints 
no further information was released on fink but robert fink told 
reporters last week that his brother had been a chronic alcoholic 
since age 17 that he spent most of his life in sacramento on the 
streets and that he had moved into the puente boarding house 
earlier this year 
simmons said his office had completed autopsies on six of the 
seven victims he said the seventh autopsy would be finished on 
tuesday but that a final report with toxicology studies would not 
be completed until sometime next week 
simmons said despite the extreme decomposition of most of the 
bodies he obtained good fingerprints from at least three victims 
and there are still better than 5050 chances of determining the 
cause of death 
the victims have been identified as three men and three women 
with an autopsy still pending on a seventh badly decomposed body 
puente 59 the landlady at the boardinghouse where the bodies 
were discovered last week remained in jail without bail on one 
murder charge authorities said they expect to file additional 
charges soon 
detectives say they believe puente murdered elderly boarders and 
hid their bodies in order to collect their social security checks 
she said in a television interview after her arrest last wednesday 
that she didnt kill anyone but admitted the checks i cashed 
yes

sixteen american psychiatrists will visit 
soviet mental institutions for two weeks in january to check on 
allegations that political dissidents are held there for harsh 
treatment as punishment for their views 
when the psychiatrists return they will publish their findings 
and the soviets will be permitted to send psychiatrists to the 
united states for meetings with american experts on practices in 
this country 
the reciprocal agreement announced monday at the state 
department appeared to represent another step to improve superpower 
relations however the soviet reputation in the controversial area 
of psychiatry could be at stake 
charles e redman the state department spokesman said the 
purpose of the visit which was arranged last week in moscow by a 
visiting us delegation was to study and analyze the us 
psychiatric process 
he declined to say exactly how many soviet citizens were in 
institutions as punishment but said there were a number of people 
in that category 
soviet dissident psychiatrist anatoly koryagin said last year he 
knew of 183 political activists detained in psychiatric institutions 
that is the number known to me he told the american 
psychiatric association at a meeting in chicago the total is much 
larger of course 
koryagin was imprisoned for antisoviet agitation in 1981 
after detailing numerous cases in which political dissidents were 
confined in soviet mental hospitals after examining many he 
diagnosed them as sane 
during his imprisonment he was tortured forcefed mentally 
abused and given powerful psychotropic drugs koryagin said 
koryagin who was freed in february 1987 said there were 16 such 
institutions for the criminally insane in which political dissidents 
were held 
leading soviet dissident andrei d sakharov during a visit to 
washington last week called detention in psychiatric institutions 
for political purposes one of the most acute abuses of human 
rights in his country 
sakharov said some political dissidents were detained but were 
outnumbered by chronic complainers who had been sent to 
institutions for habitually criticizing their supervisers 
redman said the american psychiatrists and other experts would be 
able to examine patients and also discuss law and mental health with 
soviet authorities 
he said the agreement anticipated an intensification of 
professional contacts between american and soviet psychiatrists 
the spokesman said the united states was interested is discussing 
with the soviets the use of psychiatry as a threat or punishment 
for people who we feel are actually incarcerated for political and 
religious activity 
the soviets had promised earlier this year to allow an american 
delegation to visit their institutions the issue is one of many 
human rights concerns the reagan administration has raised with 
moscow

conservatives watching warily as their ranks 
are passed by for one toplevel post after another are nonetheless 
buoyed by george bushs appointment of their philosophical soul 
mates john sununu and lee atwater 
the week after the election a virtual whos who of the right 
beat a path to the jackson place brownstone housing the offices of 
dan quayles transition team to court what some considered their 
main link in the new administration 
but with bushs selection of sununu as white house chief of staff 
and atwater for stewardship of the republican national committee 
members of the right believe they will have more than one partisan 
in the white house even as bush turns to people known more as 
pragmatists than ideologues to fill out cabinet posts 
we see dan quayle as a strong ally but with the moves george 
bush has been making recently the indication is that we dont need a 
oneman allegiance inside the administration said l brent bozell 
iii executive director of the conservative victory committee a 
political action committee that works for conservative candidates 
the choice of sununu the choice of lee atwater i think 
george bush is making a very strong pitch to conservatives that he 
wants them active in the administration he said in an interview 
last week 
other conservatives are simply beside themselves with glee 
i think its the best chief of staff appointment in my 22 years 
in washington paul weyrich president of the free congress 
research and education foundation said of the sununu selection 
weyrichs group is a conservative thinktank 
last thursday was really neat about sununu and atwater said 
conservative activist richard vigurie 
in august conservatives hailed the selection of quayle the 
indiana senator who stood on the right side of such issues as 
abortion aid to the nicaraguan rebels and school prayer 
but some still wondered about bush who ran as a moderate in his 
1980 bid for the presidency 
i dont think mr bush has completely dispelled some of the 
uncertainty that has come down over the years said dr robert 
grant of the american freedom coalition a conservative organization 
that has worked for aid to the contras with some of the 
conservative leaders theres still a certain amount of reservation 
there but with quayle there is no hesitancy because he has a 
track record 
conscious of quayles background conservatives sought him out in 
the days after the election 
on a single day the vice presidentelects schedule included a 
breakfast meeting with columnist william safire lunch with former 
united nations ambassador jeane kirkpatrick and an afternoon 
discussion with ed feulner president of the heritage foundation a 
conservative thinktank 
the wooing of one of their own made perfect sense to 
conservatives who scoff at questions about quayles academic 
background and military career that have dogged him since his 
selection at the republican national convention 
hes been an ally and a friend for many years and its a 
logical channel for conservatives to this administration because we 
dont have to teach him the philosophy weyrich said i think 
hes gotten a very bad rap in this campaign hes a lot brighter 
and more able than i think he was pictured to be 
concerns that bush will return to his moderate leanings have 
forced conservatives to act grant said the way to avert that 
concern is to push your agenda and find people who will underscore 
that agenda 
but former president richard m nixon who met with quayle on 
monday cautioned the vice presidentelect against becoming the 
conservative voice in the administration 
i would not want to have senator quayle who is a conservative 
to simply be a socalled house conservative that doesnt serve his 
interest nixon said i urged him and he agrees that he 
should reach out not only to conservatives listen to them but 
others within the party and in the democratic party as well 
selfinterest is not the only reason conservatives are seeking 
out quayle some worry about the role their ally will play in the 
bush administration 
i think what youre seeing from these conservatives is a move 
to bolster dan quayle and show solidarity with the man said 
bozell 
i just dont think that conservatives want to see dan quayle 
put in a back office somewhere in the proverbial windowless office 
of the administration he said they want to see him active out 
there and i think thats going to happen 
but donald devine of the american conservative union a 
legislative interest organization believes that quayle shouldnt 
rush into a highprofile role 
the most important thing for dan quayle is that he takes his 
time learns the job and solidifies his reputation he shouldnt be 
in a hurry said devine who served as president reagans director 
of the office of personnel management from 1981 to 1985 
as for a conservative link in the administration the selection 
of sununu and atwater indicates that quayle is not the only liaison 
according to devine 
i would say he is a link to the administration but i think 
george bush is going to be a good link he said

two former presidents and a congressional 
agency are calling on the next president to stop rescuing insolvent 
savings institutions and start closing them down 
the current approach of merging or selling insolvent 
institutions defers but does not solve the problem former 
presidents gerald ford and jimmy carter said monday in a report to 
presidentelect george bush they recommended closing all insolvent 
sampls within two years 
the general accounting office in one of a series of transition 
reports addressed to the next administration and congress made a 
more urgent appeal the time has come to move as quickly as 
possible to close insolvent institutions 
nearly 500 of the nations 3000 sampls are insolvent another 400 
dont meet federal capital standards and are considered weak 
estimates of the cost of cleaning up the mess range from 50 billion 
to 100 billion 
the federal home loan bank board has resolved 146 cases so 
far this year but only 26 of them by closing the institution most 
of the rest have been rescued the government has provided cash and 
guarantees against future loss to entice private investors and 
healthy sampls into taking over failed institutions 
gao analyst craig simmons said his agency was not against all 
mergers but said so far the bank board hasnt had the money to 
recognize all the losses and is covering them with openended 
guarantees 
karl hoyle a spokesman for the bank board defended the current 
practice he said selling too much of the property from failed sampls 
too fast could drag down the value of property held by healthy 
institutions further debilitating economically troubled regions 
it would be devastating if we were to do wholesale liquidations 
in a state like texas he said adding there are places in the 
country where wholesale closings would result in no services to a 
community 
however the gao argued that keeping failed sampls open has in the 
past simply delayed the inevitable while adding to the eventual 
costs 
but it said closing insolvent thrifts means fully recognizing 
and finding the money to pay for the losses in those institutions 
money that fslic the federal savings and loan insurance corp does 
not have today 
it said the problem was too large for the industry to bear alone 
and said the depositing public must help either through an 
appropriation of tax dollars or some sort of user charge 
the two former presidents said the industry must continue to pay 
for the cleanup of ailing institutions but they acknowledged the 
next president and congress also must go to the taxpayers 
delay is dangerous the former presidents said because a 
sudden development or unexpected crisis such as a stock market 
crash or an increase in interest or inflation rates could trigger 
a wholesale flight of depositors 
the effect on the us economy and on the world economy could 
be devastating they said 
in recommendations to avoid a repeat of the problem carter and 
ford said the fslic should be administratively merged with the fund 
for commercial banks under a common regulatory board a move opposed 
by the sampl industry 
the gao called for fundamental changes in the regulation of 
sampls citing the schizophrenic position of the federal home loan 
bank board as both an industry advocate and safety and soundness 
regulator 
it recommend consideration of merging the commercial bank and sampl 
regulatory systems but did not endorse the idea 
simmons said the gao believed a sweeping reform of deposit 
insurance which guarantees accounts in banks and sampls up to 
100000 was not needed immediately and could delay the resolution 
of the crisis instead the agency suggested experimenting with 
several reforms 
one called riskbased deposit insurance would charge higher 
premiums to banks that make risky investments another known as a 
narrow bank proposal would restrict sampls to investing deposits in 
nearly riskfree areas such as government securities

in the twilight of his presidency 
ronald reagan stood on the hilltop site of his future presidential 
library and spoke in solemn tones about how future generations will 
study the conservative tide he ushered in 
the journey has not been just my own reagan said monday 
it seems i have been guided by a force much larger than myself a 
force made up of ideas and beliefs about what this country is and 
what it could be 
the president and his wife nancy gathered with close friends to 
break ground on what will be the 40 million home for the largest 
accumulation of papers and memorabilia for any president 
former cabinet members william clark ed meese and william french 
smith industrialist armand hammer mca chief lew wasserman and 
actor charlton heston shared the moment with a beaming reagan 
this is a most humbling moment for me said reagan who will 
relinquish the presidency to george bush on jan 20 the story 
that will be told inside the walls that are yet to be built here is 
the story not only of a presidency but of a movement 
after his sixminute speech the president was given a 
chromeplated shovel and quickly dug up three heaping mounds of dirt 
in the groundbreaking ceremony the first lady however struggled 
with her shovel in the hard soil and wobbled while trying to scoop 
it 
the ronald reagan presidential library which will be the 
repository for an expected 62 million papers exceeding richard 
nixons record 44 million will occupy a 153000squarefoot 
spanishstyle building in ventura countys tierra rejada valley 45 
miles northwest of los angeles 
the selection of the simi valley site about 70 miles southeast 
of the reagans ranch in santa barbara county came after planners 
of the reagan library were thwarted in an attempt to build it at 
stanford university in palo alto calif 
appearing at the ceremony at the start of a sixday thanksgiving 
vacation at his ranch in the santa ynez mountains reagan talked 
reflectively of his eight years as president 
the reagan imprint was based on a fiscal policy aimed at 
stimulating economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation of 
business along with a resurgence of us international influence 
brought about principally by a major military buildup projections 
of american power in the third world and warming if unsteady 
relations with the soviet union 
what this library will house is the record of ideas and 
policies that have undergirded our accomplishments reagan said 
there will be much to study here much to discuss much to mull 
over 
this library will allow scholars of the future to cast their 
own judgments on these years and i would not presume to predict the 
result of their researches he said but i have to believe that 
scholars of good will upon examining the historical record that 
will be contained herein will judge our efforts well 
but as for us at present we can only say this we have done 
our best and we pray that it has been enough 
the land for the library was donated by a los angeles development 
company blakeleyschwartz the selection sparked opposition by 
environmentalists initially because the site impinged on a greenbelt 
area protected from largescale development by a decadeold 
nonbinding agreement among the communities of simi valley moorpark 
and thousand oaks 
the library will be built from donations to the private ronald 
reagan library foundation it will sit in an area of rolling hills 
covered with brush beavertail cactus and wildflowers 
the building will include underground storage a museum and 
research materials depicting the administration and historical 
events during the reagan years

the recently resigned head of soviet space 
research says his countrys maiden space shuttle launch had 
absolutely no scientific value and the us and soviet shuttle 
programs are in deep trouble economically 
roald z sagdeev who headed the soviet space research institute 
for 15 years said last weeks inaugural soviet shuttle flight 
like the 1981 flight of the first us shuttle was an 
outstanding technological achievement 
the shuttle however is technology of the 21st century why 
should we pay 20th century money for it 
my personal view is that american experience with the shuttle 
indicates that from the point of view of cost efficiency the 
shuttle is in deep trouble said sagdeev who has followed closely 
the us decisionmaking process on the shuttle and is a key science 
and arms control adviser to president mikhail s gorbachev 
it is much simpler and cheaper to fly a payload with any kind 
of expendable vehicle 
sagdeev like many american scientists fears the costly shuttles 
are drawing away much needed funds from basic science and that 
manned flight is unnecessary for most research 
it went up it came down but it had absolutely no scientific 
value was sagdeevs blunt assessment of the 3hour unmanned 
orbital flight a week ago today of the soviet shuttle that ended the 
us monopoly on reusable spacecraft 
in a wideranging interview with the associated press the 
55yearold physicist confirmed he voluntarily left the top post at 
the agency that handles space exploration and astronomy because he 
felt no one person should dominate an institute for such a long time 
sagdeev a longtime member of the soviet academy of sciences 
said he would concentrate on his own research and the think tank he 
heads that advises gorbachev on arms control 
the space institutes 1500 researchers chose by popular vote its 
new director albert galeev 48 also a physicist who was a student 
of sagdeev at novosibirsk university 
he is not just fresh blood but an administrator as well as a 
scientist and he knows rules of the game between creative scientists 
and bureaucrats sagdeev said in the interview partly in english 
and in russian with the help of an american translator 
sagdeev who specialized in space and plasma physics research 
said soviet science has contributed too little to the worlds stock 
of scientific knowledge mainly because of its bureaucratic structure 
in a speech last month in moscow during elections at the academy 
of sciences whose members include about 400 top scientists in all 
fields he said the soviet space program could lose its edge because 
it rewards bureaucracy rather than scientific merit 
in nominating humanrights campaigner andrei d sakharov to the 
academys board of directors sagdeev also said the election offered 
a chance for the academy to make up for failing to elevate some 
leading space and nuclear researchers to top positions in past 
decades 
sagdeev declined to discuss technical details of the soviet 
shuttle buran russian for snowstorm or blizzard or the goals of 
the program saying he had not been directly involved in its 
development 
he said he was not impressed with the sophisticated computer 
flight program that allowed the shuttle to maneuver and land by 
remote control and which the soviets say will give cosmonauts more 
time for scientific research 
we had quite a few more years to come up with a shuttle and 
probably the americans would produce now something much more 
sophisticated than the existing us shuttle design he said 
the soviets have made public few details about the buran a 
lookalike of the us shuttle staterun media have only indirectly 
indicated that its cost is similar to the us program or about 10 
billion 
sagdeev said shuttle technology wont make up within this century 
the huge difference in cost between expendable rockets and reusable 
shuttles 
safety measures taken after the us shuttle challenger disaster 
will add to the costs he said and national aeronautics and space 
administation officials who initially had hoped to have up to 40 
shuttle launches a year have had to scale back plans to about one a 
month greatly reducing the programs economical efficiency 
the soviets repeatedly have said the us shuttle was wasteful 
and unreliable and have criticized its military uses the pentagon 
however says that the soviet spacecraft could be used to deploy 
killer satellites and nuclear missile defense weapons 
the next us shuttle flight with atlantis is to carry five 
military astronauts on a secret defense department mission dec 1 
that reportedly will deploy a satellite to spy on the soviet union 
the soviets who say they plan up to four flights per year have not 
announced another mission 
asked why the soviets were engaged in a shuttle program sagdeev 
said a lot of things are done on the basis of old stereotypes 
just by copying each other 
sagdeev was in new york to sign a major book contract for his 
memoirs and took part along with sakharov in board meetings and 
fundraising efforts of the soviet foundation for the survival and 
development of humanity the moscowbased foundation accepts no 
government funds and is directed by a 30member board of prominent 
americans and soviets including sakharov and sagdeev

coming to america starring eddie murphy 
was a boxoffice comedy smash but humorist art buchwald isnt 
laughing about the movie he says was his idea hes suing for 5 
million 
im not quitting the columnist vowed in telephone interview 
from washington on monday after his lawyer filed the lawsuit against 
paramount studios in los angeles superior court 
murphys manager says his client who isnt a defendant in the 
lawsuit wrote the script paramount refused to comment 
buchwald whose lawsuit is the second to dispute the movies 
origin says his story king for a day was the inspiration for 
the script the movie is a fable about an african prince who lands 
in new york works in a fastfood restaurant and finds a wife 
king for a day tells of an oilrich countrys king who comes 
to washington loses his power in a coup while absent winds up 
living in a ghetto where he works for a caterer and pursues a woman 
who works for the state department 
asked whether the dispute has soured him on writing for the 
movies buchwald replied if i win i wont be soured if i lose 
ill be very sour 
in another interview the lampooner of washingtons foibles and 
follies deadpanned that he would be willing to accept 40 million as 
his rightful share of the movies gross which his suit predicts 
will hit 250 million 
its not only the biggest hit of the year it will probably be 
the biggest hit of the decade said buchwalds attorney pierce 
odonnell 
coming to america was greeted with mixed reviews but 
collected huge boxoffice receipts last summer it trailed disneys 
hit who framed roger rabbit which has taken in more than 147 
million at the box office 
according to the trade newspaper daily variety coming to 
america has grossed more than 120 million so far 
buchwald said he sold paramount the option on his eightpage 
story outline in 1983 which was snapped up as a potential vehicle 
for murphy but he says his project was dropped and he was never 
paid 
ive written seven to 10 treatments before and ive always 
gotten paid he said 
but buchwald said paramount told him in january 1985 that the 
studio no longer was interested in king for a day 
buchwald said he then sold the idea to warner bros which 
notified him this year that it was dropping the project because 
murphy had a similar movie ready for release 
buchwalds lawsuit claims breach of contract by paramount rather 
than copyright infringement normally the basis of such actions the 
lawsuit seeks 5 million in compensatory damages plus unspecified 
punitive damages 
odonnell contends that buchwald and producer alain bernheim are 
entitled to shares of the lucrative film because they brought the 
idea to paramount 
murphys manager bob wachs said eddie murphy wrote the story 
100 per cent there are many suits on coming to america mr 
buchwald is one of the last to file 
we have no gripe with murphy said odonnell our contract 
was with paramount and for once the lawyers wrote a clear 
document 
under the contract appended to the lawsuit buchwald was to 
receive 65000 and 15 percent of net profits if a movie were 
produced from his idea bernheim was to receive 235000 plus 175 
percent of profits as producer 
the other lawsuit involving coming to america was filed 
against paramount and two writers in federal court by shelby m 
gregory gregory 38 of hollywood is seeking 10 million 
contending the movie was based on his completed story toto the 
african prince

prime minister brian mulroney called early tuesday 
for unity and healing after his conservatives won the house of 
commons majority needed to assure passage of a pact lifting all 
barriers on trade with the united states 
canadians have indicated the road they wish to follow he 
told a rally in his hometown of baiecomeau quebec after mondays 
vote ended a bitterly contested 51day campaign dominated by the 
trade issue we will proceed to bring greater unity harmony and 
prosperity to canada 
the 49yearold prime minister who won a second straight term 
said in the nationally broadcast speech that now it is a time for 
healing in the land 
he spoke of creating not just more prosperity but more 
opportunity and security for all canadians 
no party had won two successive majorities in canada since 1953 
the canadian broadcasting corp projected the house of commons 
would have 169 seats for mulroneys progressive conservative party 
21 more than needed for a majority in the 295seat chamber 
it projected john turners opposition liberals who fiercely 
attacked the trade pact would win 81 seats and the socialist new 
democratic party of ed broadbent which also opposed the accord 
would take 45 seats 
turner said early tuesday he had phoned mulroney to assure him of 
cooperation 
speaking to a rally in his home district in vancouver british 
columbia he said he had no regrets for staging the campaign to 
promote my vision of a strong independent and sovereign canada a 
canada in charge of our own destiny 
turnout was about 75 percent of the nations 175 million voters 
the canadian press news agency said its breakdown of the popular 
vote with 952 percent tabulated showed the conservatives with 433 
percent down 7 percentage points from 1984 the liberals with 324 
percent up 5 percentage points and the new democrats in third with 
197 percent 
canadian press said the conservatives had 54 million votes the 
liberals had 405 million and the new democrats had 24 million 
the conservatives had a jittery start in the four atlantic 
maritime provinces but did well enough in central quebec and 
ontario to get at least the 148 seats necessary for a majority the 
cbc said 
ontario prime minister david peterson a liberal who was one of 
the most prominent foes of the free trade agreement said in a cbc 
interview that he couldnt explain why the province did not come 
through with the expected strong support for his party to halt the 
deal 
i respect the voice of the people of canada who speak on an 
issue he said i guess only history will say who is right and 
who was wrong 
president reagan and mulroney signed the free trade agreement 
jan 2 and mulroney needed a majority in the commons to have it 
ratified the us congress has already approved the pact 
the plan is to take effect jan 1 and phase out remaining tariffs 
over the next 10 years between canada and the united states whose 
twoway trade is worth 150 billion a year 
mulroney was buoyed in the last days by polls that showed his 
party back in the lead with a chance at a majority he told 
reporters he would convene parliament quickly to act on the trade 
deal 
he led the conservatives to a smashing victory in 1984 that gave 
them 210 of the 282 seats 
turner used a weekend rally to repeat his plea that voters keep 
canada canadian for canadians and kill the agreement by voting for 
his party 
mulroney spent the last campaign weekend in his native quebec 
the huge frenchspeaking province that has 75 of the 295 seats in 
the commons turner hoped for a big score in the 99 seats of 
ontario a predominantly englishspeaking province where opposition 
to the agreement was strongest 
quebec and ontario are home to the majority of canadas 26 
million people 
although the liberals were far behind when the campaign began 
oct 1 turner revived their prospects with relentless attacks on 
the free trade agreement as a sellout of canada 
mulroney says the deal guarantees future canadian prosperity by 
assuring access to the us market 
in an interview with macleans the canadian news weekly 
mulroney said the trade deal is a must for canadas future its 
a visionary instrument of job creation and new wealth and it is 
clearly something that is on the right side of history 
turner calls the agreement a bad deal for canada he told 
macleans it would radically change the direction of our country 
it yields the economic levers of sovereignty our energy our 
investment policy our capital markets supplymanagement of 
agriculture 
conservatives also reminded voters of canadas general prosperity 
during the past four years mulroney says 13 million jobs were 
created

while share prices rose moderately reaching another record high on 
the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 12178 yen down 074 yen from mondays 
close of 12252 yen opening at 12185 yen the currency moved 
within 12160 yen and 12285 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues a 10406point 
winner the previous day added another 14586 points or 050 
percent to finish trading at 2943012 its record high on monday 
the index closed at 2928426 points 
the dollar slumped at the opening of trading due mainly to the 
absence of joint central bank intervention during the previous 
session according to dealers they also cited recent remarks by 
presidentelect george bush ruling out tax hikes to narrow the us 
federal budget deficit 
market sources said the bank of japan entered the market to buy 
dollars tuesday when the dollar fell to around 12160 yen 
its not dollarselling thats pushing the currency down 
further at the moment but rather that nobody wants to keep many 
dollars around prior to a holiday said a dealer with the bank of 
tokyo speaking on condition of anonymity 
market participants were inclined to sell the dollar ahead of the 
labor thanksgiving day national holiday on wednesday when currency 
and stock markets will be closed he said the dealer also said many 
others were sitting on the sidelines in expectation of further 
intervention by the central bank 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa said tuesday morning that japan 
was willing to take measures to save the us currency but he 
indicated he was not overly concerned about the dollars fall to the 
upper 12100yen level 
miyazawa also said the dollars slide following the us 
presidential election on nov 8 stemmed from speculation that has 
ignored basic economic fundamentals between the united states and 
japan

a national assembly committee probing 
the bloody military suppression of the 1980 kwangju uprising voted 
today to subpoena former president chun doohwan to explain his role 
in the incident 
the subpeona came a day before aides say chun in a last ditch 
attempt to calm growing public anger will apologize on national 
television for corruption and abuses of power during his rule 
opposition lawmakers on the national assembly committee ignored 
pleas from government members to wait until chun speaks to the 
nation before deciding whether to proceed with a subpoena 
the committee voted 1612 to subpoena the former president with 
members of the governing democratic justice party voting against 
opposition groups and many ordinary koreans have been demanding 
chun be investigated and punished for alleged corruption and 
wholesale violation of human rights radical groups demanding chuns 
arrest have staged a series of violent demonstrations 
according to his aides chun will apologize on national 
television wednesday for corruption by some of his relatives and 
associates and human rights abuses during his sevenyear term that 
ended in february 
the former general who took power with military backing in 1980 
is also to announce he will turn over most of his wealth to the 
government and accept rural banishment to atone for abuses under his 
rule 
plans for chun to make his statement monday or today were delayed 
by problems finding a safe haven where he would be secure from 
attacks by radical students and other opponents aides said 
chun denies any personal wrongdoing but some of his relatives 
and associates have been convicted or charged with embezzling public 
funds and peddling government influence 
president roh taewoo another former general and associate of 
chun is trying to defuse the crisis without damaging his 
governments position 
roh who won a plurality but not a majority in december 
presidential elections as two other candidates split the opposition 
vote must somehow satisfy public indignation against chun while 
distancing his government and party from the past abuses 
roh indicated he is considering pardoning chun after the former 
leader makes a public apology according to south korean press 
reports but governing party officials indicate they will initiate a 
probe against chun if the apology fails to quiet public anger

southern city of kwangju decided to go ahead and subpoena chun after 
he refused to answer requests earlier this year to appear before the

days and officials indicated chun would be summoned in early

on the streets of south philadelphia home to 
many of the areas mafia members few believe the racketeering 
conviction of mob boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo and 16 
associates means the end of organized crime 
the convictions arent gonna change anything said dino 
crimi whose cousin salvatore scafidi was one of the 17 convicted 
saturday after a twomonth trial in fact it should get worse 
now its all open territory out here 
scarfo and his associates were convicted on all charges in a 
racketeering conspiracy that included nine murders four attempted 
murders drug dealing loansharking and illegal gambling 
all face possible sentences of 40 to 55 years in prison scarfo 
is already serving a 14year sentence for a 1987 extortion and 
conspiracy conviction 
scarfo whom the government called a paranoid coldblooded 
killer seized control of the philadelphiasouthern new jersey mob 
after the murders of his predecessors 
former boss angelo bruno was shot in the head in 1980 as he sat 
in a car outside his south philadelphia home his successor philip 
chicken man testa was killed less than a year later when a 
remotecontrolled bomb packed with nails exploded when he opened his 
front door 
scarfo continued the murders to eliminate enemies and consolidate 
power according to prosecutors 
capt frank friel head of the police departments 
organizedcrime unit believes the mob has learned its lesson and 
wont put a killer in charge again he sees a local leader emerging 
in the mold of bruno 
theyll get a lowprofile businessman friel said 
joel friedman chief of the us justice departments organized 
crime strike force in philadelphia said the mob was crippled but 
will not disappear as long as there is money to be made through drug 
trafficking loan sharking extortion and gambling 
nevertheless the conviction of the mobs key figures has 
shifted the equilibrium in the publics favor and police will 
maintain the pressure to diminish mob influence he said 
with one conviction we were able to take the guts out of the 
mob said assistant us attorney louis pichini who headed the 
fivemember prosecution team it broke the myth of the mafias 
invincibility 
friedman said he expects other gangsters to fill the leadership 
vacuum 
some predict mobsters from new york particularly the gambino 
family will try to take over in atlantic city nj where scarfo 
lived 
an fbi agent quoted anonymously by the philadelphia daily news 
speculated that reputed gambino family head john gotti will take 
control possibly even with scarfos approval because the two were 
friendly in recent years 
officials agree that with or without scarfos blessing someone 
eventually will fill the void to control the millions generated by 
the areas illegal enterprises 
even though all the bosses have been in jail awaiting trial 
the numbers game has been going on and so has the loansharking 
the agent said we have seen signs that theyre becoming more 
involved in methamphetamine we expect that to continue under a 
caretaker or somebody coming in from the outside

us rep robert garcia indicted with his wife 
in the wedtech scandal two weeks after his reelection to a sixth 
term vowed to fight the corruption charges with all of my 
godgiven strength 
the indictments against the 55yearold democrat and his wife 
jamie lee garcia 48 were issued three days after rep mario 
biaggi dny was sentenced to eight years in prison for extorting 
cash and stock valued at up to 3 million from the wedtech corp 
at least 19 people including former white house aide lyn 
nofziger have been convicted in the case nofziger was found guilty 
of illegal lobbying 
in mondays federal grand jury indictments the garcias were 
accused of extorting 76000 from wedtech plus a 20000 
interestfree loan from onetime wedtech vice chairman mario moreno 
in exchange for obtaining favorable lucrative defense contracts 
for wedtech said james fox head of the fbi office here 
they also were accused of taking 77500 and a diamond and 
emerald necklace from wedtech founder john mariotta and his wife 
jennie in 1985 
wedtech was a tiny machine shop in garcias south bronx 
congressional district that became a huge defense contractor through 
a small business administration program that allowed minorityowned 
firms to obtain government contracts without competitive bidding 
but allegations of bribery influencepeddling and other 
wrongdoing enmeshed wedtech in a series of federal and state 
investigations that forced it into bankruptcy proceedings in 
december 1986 
i maintain my innocence and that of my wife and pledge to fight 
this case with all of my godgiven strength said garcia a 
twotime bronze star winner in the korean war who in 1978 became the 
second person of puerto rican ancestry to be elected to the house of 
representatives 
my brush with the criminal justice system has left me deeply 
shaken as i have observed the government harass and intimidate my 
staff colleagues friends and family to induce them to say 
something negative about me while virtually ignoring polygraph 
evidence demonstrating my innocence and all other exculpatory 
information and testimony garcia said in a statement issued 
through a spokesman bill danvers 
the statement also said i note that despite an investigation 
which has lasted nearly two years and has scrutinized virtually 
every facet of my personal and professional life the charges deal 
only with the preposterous allegations of mario moreno one of the 
most notorious felons of the 20th century 
moreno was one of four wedtech officials who pleaded guilty to 
bribing government officials and cooperated with prosecutors in 
earlier wedtech cases 
moreno testified earlier this year at biaggis trial that the 
company had paid 80000 to garcia the payments for political 
favors and political introductions were made to garcia because 
he and his wife requested it said moreno 
moreno also testified about numerous alleged payoffs to bankers 
businessmen union officials and a local public utility manager 
also named in mondays federal indictment was attorney ralph 
vallone jr 41 of santurce puerto rico he was accused of 
funneling 86100 in wedtech payments through his law office to mrs 
garcia as consulting fees passing on 76000 and keeping 
10100 for himself 
vallones attorney hal meyerson said his client was innocent 
and the payments were legal with vallone being paid for legal 
services and mrs garcia being paid for public relations work 
the indictment did not say what garcia did in return for the 
payments and us attorney rudolph giuliani would not elaborate 
none of the payments the loan or the jewelry garcia is accused 
of taking was reported on his congressional financial disclosure 
forms in 1984 and 1985 according to the sevencount indictment 
vallone and the garcias each face a maximum penalty of up to 20 
years in prison and 250000 in fines if convicted of extortion the 
most serious charge they all face maximum penalties of between two 
and 15 years in prison on additional charges of conspiracy bribe 
receiving and receipt of an illegal gratuity 
they are to be arraigned on the indictment dec 1 in us 
district court

daddy still take me out with him nussbaum said she responded 
go ask him 
nussbaum said that after lisa went to ask steinberg she heard 
noises in the bedroom like joel throwing lisa the report said 
steinberg then appeared in the bathroom carrying the child and 
said as he handed her over to nussbaum this is your child what 
have you done this has gone far enough the report said 
nussbaum placed lisa on the floor and noticed water and food 
coming out of her mouth 
the report said nussbaum thought steinberg may have poured water 
down lisas mouth and that she was drowning nussbaum said she then

he saw on lisa when he took pictures of her in school two weeks 
before she died 
stuart gross said he initially was reluctant to photograph the 
firstgrader when he visited the school oct 22 1987 because of 
her numerous bruises and dirty unkempt appearance

lisa he said he was drawn to her when she began directing two other 
children on posing the way he wanted them 
she seemed older more mature he said 
i put her on the right side and i flooded my light into her and 
i had her turn her head this way and down so you wouldnt see it 
the last thing my client wants to see is bruises

eliminated in the way i photographed them 
also monday justice harold rothwax replaced a juror who sources 
say was beaten last week by her livein boyfriend the juror is a 
30yearold mother of two whose name was withheld

baiecomeau quebec ap prime minister brian mulroney 
celebrated his reelection in his rural hometown today with hugs 
handshakes and the playing of the us battle hymn of the republic 
the american tone to the conclusion of a bitterly contested 
contest made no difference to the 5000 backers crammed into a local 
recreation center the returns showed mulroney and his conservative 
party had won an election that centered on the free trade pact with 
the united states 
we knew he was going to do it paper worker maurice tougas 
said of mulroneys win between gulps of beer now that hes put 
baiecomeau on the map its never going to come off 
mulroney who at the midpoint of his first term was third in the 
polls behind opposition leaders john turner and ed broadbent fought 
a tough campaign to come back and win a second majority government 
mulroney likes to portray himself as a statesman and canadas 
most competent leader but he thrives on oldfashioned politicking 
the 49yearold prime minister comes from a workingclass family 
in baiecomeau on the north shore of the st lawrence river he was 
ambitious and built a successful legal and corporate career in 
montreal 
he first tried for the conservative party leadership in 1976 but 
was not successful until 1983 the first year he was elected to the 
house of commons 
mulroney is the first bilingual native of quebec to lead his 
party and he has used that fact skillfully in expanding the 
conservatives base in that critical largely frenchspeaking 
province 
support for cronies was charged during his first years in office 
dropping his popularity drastically in the public opinion polls 
eight cabinet ministers resigned in separate incidents but by 
the time he called the election oct 1 mulroney had distanced 
himself from the controversies and was able to point to an 
experienced management team 
but then turner put mulroney on the defensive during televised 
debates in late october by charging the trade pact in effect would 
sell canada off to american business interests 
national campaign chairman john tory said two events helped the 
conservatives recover two weeks later mulroneys impromptu debate 
with three freetrade hecklers in victoria british columbia and 
former justice emmett halls statement on free trade 
hall considered the father of medicare said the freetrade deal 
would not threaten the medical insurance plan his comments dampened 
opposition claims that the deal would hurt social programs 
mulroney had planned to stage the campaign on competency and the 
prosperity that lasted through his term to create 13 million jobs 
in canada 
by the campaigns closing days however mulroney was exuberantly 
telling crowds at his rallies that they had a choice between john 
turner the ripper or brian the builder 
he described the opponents of the trade agreement he signed last 
january with president reagan as jittery negative defenders of past 
traditions that could not survive in the modern world 
mulroney by contrast saw himself as a nation builder ready 
to lead a competent canada into full competition with the much 
larger and more powerful united states 
the phrase surfaced in the last of six hours of a debate last 
month when turner accused the prime minister of selling out canada 
with the free trade agreement 
mulroney replied that he carried through on the agreement to 
build canada just as his father had gone to northeastern quebec 55 
years ago where he and hundreds of other laborers built a small town 
i believe that in my own modest way i am nation building 
because i believe this benefits canada and i love canada the 
prime minister said 
the prime minister is a roman catholic he is married and has 
four children

chicagos mayoral race moves into high gear now 
with an illinois supreme courts ruling that the election must be 
held early next year 
at least two of the seven hopefuls began running radio 
advertisements on monday and the courts decision drops a political 
barrier to the expected announcements that mayor eugene sawyer and 
states attorney richard m daley will run 
this starts the positioning phase of the race said don rose 
a strategist for alderman timothy evans one of the contenders to 
fill out the last two years of the late harold washingtons term 
the public is still not fully involved at this point rose 
said so it becomes a period of jockeying and preparing for the 
hard decisions such as whether to continue 
most of the candidates have said they are in the contest to the 
end but because of racial issues involved its become commonplace 
to assume some will drop out 
political observers seem to agree that there can be no more than 
one black candidate if the black voting bloc that made washington 
the citys first black mayor is not to be split 
likewise a fragmented white vote probably would mean a 
continuation of blacks controlling city hall 
sawyer who was appointed by city council after washingtons 
death of a heart attack on nov 25 1987 had been hoping for a 
ruling that would allow him to serve out the full term through 1991 
but the court on monday sided with city officials who scheduled a 
feb 28 primary and an april 4 general election next year 
the seven justices ruled that state laws governing vacancies in 
office were designed to ensure that an appointed official would not 
serve such a long portion of an unexpired term 
although sawyer had hoped for a different ruling he indicated he 
was prepared to run and said he was pleased that this decision has 
been made and that the people in chicago are no longer in limbo 
we are ready for the upcoming election and look forward to 
winning it said sawyer who has raised nearly 3 million in less 
than a year against the possibility of a spring election 
daley widely reported to be planning a second bid for the job 
his father held for two decades said he would make an announcement 
in the next two weeks 
this is a serious decision daley said adding that the 
public is happy that the supreme court finally rendered a decision 
on the election question 
evans and danny davis both considered leading contenders for 
washingtons mantle of black political leadership in chicago also 
praised the ruling 
according to a recent chicago suntimesabctv poll daley is 
supported by 37 percent of all voters evans by 22 percent sawyer 
by 10 percent and alderman lawrence bloom 9 percent 
the remaining 22 percent was undecided or divided among the other 
announced candidates davis and white alderman edward burke former 
chicago parks district superintendent edmund kelly

the changes end britains longstanding portfolio for 
arabisraeli affairs at the united nations under which british

region

nations came in june when perez de cuellar took charge of ceasefire 
negotiations between iran and iraq iran and iraq agreed to halt 
their eightyear war in august and negotiations over borders and 
prisoners are continuing under un auspices 
perez de cuellar a peruvian also personally initiated 
negotiations between the leaders of the greek and turkish 
communities on cyprus aimed at ending partition of the island 
ms younes said the secretarygeneral is making the changes in 
response to the increasing demand for his good offices in the 
maintenance of international peace and security and for united 
nations peacekeeping operations 
she declined to characterize the change as a promotion or 
demotion 
goulding will also be in charge of the planning and conduct of 
future peacekeeping operations a formidable task with several 
potential new missions on the horizon the spokeswoman said

mexican police believe that snipers who 
fired on a threemember rio grande rafting party killing one were 
drug traffickers who resented the americans unwitting intrusion 
into a drug deal 
us and chihuahua state police searched the rugged area monday 
and enlisted a top tracker to find the attackers who killed michael 
heffley 40 as he tried to drag his wounded wife jamie 32 to 
safety 
police have not identified suspects or made any arrests in the 
attack which occurred saturday during a rafting excursion outside 
big bend national park on the southwestern texas border between the 
united states and mexico 
authorities later combed the area on horseback and discovered 
tracks that indicated the assailants fled on horses toward mulato a 
mexican town about 15 miles from the shooting scene 
heffley was shot in the back with a 3030 caliber rifle as he 
tried to help his wife from the raft under a barrage of gunfire 
authorities said she had been wounded in the left side and left 
shoulder 
the couples guide jim burr 36 an employee of terlinguabased 
far flung adventures was shot in the right thigh with a 22caliber 
rifle said jesus porras vega of mexicos chihuahua state judicial 
police 
mexican police theorize the snipers who fired from atop 
300foothigh bluffs in mexico overlooking the rio grande were drug 
traffickers who resented the boaters unwitting intrusion into an 
illegal drug transaction 
the assailants didnt want them to see said state police 
officer jesus porras vega 
smuggling has been an economic cornerstone of the area for years 
horses and guns were the first contraband later smugglers took 
candelilla leaves from the united states back into mexico to boil 
and turn into candle wax 
marijuana is now smuggled across the border though little of it 
passes through on the ground in the big bend region most marijuana 
crossing into texas is flown in by largescale traffickers 
presidio county sheriff rick thompson said he doubts the 
smuggling theory he and porras said the area near the ridge had 
been a marijuana field in the past but was not used for that 
purpose this year 
its not like they the assailants were out there tending 
their marijuana or cutting or harvesting it or whatever thompson 
said so there was no provocation 
residents of the isolated area along the river think the 
assailants might have been under the influence of drugs 
i think they were drunk or something and said hey lets see 
if we can hit the raft said ed allen assistant manager of 
lajitasbased big bend river tours 
the two injured were in stable condition monday at brewster 
memorial hospital in alpine my wounds pretty minor i just got a 
hole in my leg burr said 
at the time of the shooting the assailants were in mexico and 
the victims were in the united states meaning the attackers could 
be tried in either country officials said

a state judge citing inconclusive evidence set a 
career criminal free after the 62yearold man spent 17 months in 
jail awaiting a trial on triple murder charges 
good luck justice john leahy told william gergel as he 
ordered gergels immediate release on his own recognizance monday 
stay out of trouble 
assistant district attorney james quinn had recommended the 
release although he was not prepared to dismiss the indictment 
against gergel prosecutors need two more months to complete their 
investigation into the case he said 
the evidence against gergel and another reported suspect is 
still too inconclusive to require that gergel remain in jail said 
dick piperno a spokesman for queens district attorney john santucci 
under state law there is no deadline for bringing murder 
defendants to trial 
gergel who has a record of convictions ranging from larceny to 
murder and has spent more than 25 years in jail for crimes from the 
1940s to 1970s was arrested shortly after the june 1987 killings of 
three people during a liquor store robbery 
police said gergel matched a vague description compiled from 
interviews with witnesses but another man lawrence condon also 62 
and with a long criminal record emerged as a suspect much later 
after gergel was already in jail 
condon who has not been charged in the triple murder is 
currently serving time in attica state prison on a weapons 
conviction in a separate case he and gergel have denied committing 
the liquor store robbery and killings in which the victims were a 
couple in their 60s who owned the store and a 35yearold customer 
in my opinion its too little too late gergels attorney 
marvyn kornberg said of his clients release they should have 
done this a long time ago the district attorneys office should 
not take 18 months to investigate a case that the police screwed 
up 
gergel thin with long gray hair left the courtroom and kissed 
his tearful wife judith then met a sister he had not seen in 11 
years and who had thought he was dead until seeing his picture in 
a newspaper a few weeks ago 
its been so wrong from the beginning gergel said of his 
arrest in the triple murder im not mad at the district attorney 
but at the police at the 110th precinct 
kornberg said gergel plans to try to find a job

the united states and soviet union have signed a 
preliminary agreement for a drugtesting program of their top 
athletes in training a soviet sports official said today 
edwin moses a twotime olympic champion in the 400meter 
hurdles said the agreement will reduce the paranoia between their 
athletes and ours the skepticism especially on our side which has 
led to the escalation of abuse this is a major step forward 
most observers believe that without testing in training the 
fight against doping the use of drugs by athletes to improve their 
performance will never be won 
american and soviet athletes are currently tested only during 
certain events including the olympics and other major 
championships they are generally not tested during the offseason 
or on short notice 
sergei portugalov a doctor on the ussr sports committee and 
a member of the ussoviet panel said today that a memorandum of 
agreement was signed late monday 
the document was signed by baaron pittenger executive director 
of the us olympic committee and vasily gromyko deputy chairman 
of the soviet state committee for physical culture and sports it is 
subject to approval by both nations olympic committees 
moses who has been a longtime campaigner against drug abuse 
told reporters in moscow monday that he thinks us athletes of will 
be pleased to cooperate because they will view this situation of 
being an olympic competitor as being a responsibility more than 
being a privilege 
portugalov who heads the sports medicine laboratory section of 
the soviet sports committee said no dates have been set and no 
decision has been made on how many athletes will be subject to the 
testing portugalov said 
american officials will visit soviet training camps and soviet 
officials will go to us training sites twice a year to carry out 
the testing portugalov said 
not only anabolic steroids which can improve an athletes bulk 
and performance will be tested for according to the agreement 
we want to test any group of drugs that are banned by the 
international olympic committee portugalov said 
drug tests will also be carried out during dual americansoviet 
athletic meets such as in swimming and track and field 
portugalov said he hopes other nations will join the ussoviet 
initiative this agreement is open for all other countries we 
invite any other country to join us in our battle to to solve the 
doping issue in sports 
most recently canadian sprinter ben johnson was stripped of an 
olympic gold medal he won in the seoul olympics in september after 
testing positive for anabolic steroids 
the international olympic committee has sponsored an antidoping 
charter and sports ministers from at least 70 countries are 
expected to ratify it during a conference in moscow that began 
monday and that was independent of the meeting of sports officials 
from the two superpowers 
the only problem in the ussoviet agreement was blood doping 
because there are no test methods yet portugalov said 
testing for blood doping which can improve an athletes 
performance in endurance sports like crosscountry skiing and 
marathon running has not started yet blooddoping is banned by the 
ioc

break out of federal custody were arrested early monday on a 
rainsoaked parapet of the prison

talks aimed at forming a broadbased coalition 
government with the rightwing likud and leftist labor parties broke 
off today over what post labor leader shimon peres might have in a 
new cabinet 
a labor party statement broadcast by israel radio said there 
appeared to be no basis for continuing exploratory talks about 
joining likud 
officials said the talks broke down over labor demands for senior 
cabinet posts and an active search for peace negotiations with the 
arabs who have revolted against israeli rule in the occupied 
territories since dec 8 at least 314 palestinians and 11 israelis 
have died in the unrest 
a spokesman for the foreign ministry which is headed by peres 
left open the possibility talks could resume later 
however some labor party officials said it was likely prime 
minister yitzhak shamir would now form a narrow government with 
small religious and rightwing parties 
a peres aide said the talks broke down over labors demand for 
parity in top cabinet posts and the peace issue he said likud would 
not give a definite answer 
likud leaders didnt say no but they didnt say yes most of 
all they didnt convince labor this would be a government that would 
put israel on the right track toward peace he said on condition 
of anonymity 
shamirs likud which won 40 seats in the 120member parliament 
in the nov 1 elections secured the majority needed for a coalition 
by allying with seven religious and farright parties 
but shamir seeking to blunt the power of the small parties 
heeded a call from president chaim herzog to try to include labor in 
a national unity government 
shamir spokesman yossi ahimeir said even if the breakdown in 
talks with labor proved permanent there was a possibility that labor 
would join the government in a narrow capacity at a later date 
shamir has 13 days before he needs to report to the president on 
his efforts to form a new government herzog could grant him a 
threeweek extension 
another shamir aide who demanded anonymity said the talks 
deadlocked over labor demands that it get two of the four major 
portfolios prime ministry defense foreign affairs and finance 
israel radio said agreement was reached that shamir would stay as 
prime minister and labors yitzhak rabin would remain as defense 
minister but there was an impasse over the remaining two posts one 
of which peres sought for himself 
the shamir aide said likud refused to grant a labor demand for 
veto power in the inner cabinet a group of senior ministers who 
make key policy decisions 
in the outgoing coalition government formed after the 1984 
elections ended in stalemate each party has five seats in the inner 
cabinet and no major decisions are taken without a consensus 
between the two major parties 
shamir aides said talks continued with the small religious 
parties 
israel radio quoted labor officials as saying they believed 
shamir faced a difficult task in working out an agreement to satisfy 
ultraorthodox without alienating jewish supporters of israel abroad 
if shamir forms a government without labor he will likely face 
increased pressure from the farright to launch a campaign to 
establish new jewish settlements in the occupied territories and 
perhaps annex occupied territory 
he may also face new pressure from jewish fundamentalists to 
enforce the observance of the sabbath by closing restaurants and 
soccer stadiums and to tighten laws against the sale of pork 
but promises to the religious have already raised the ire of 
north american and european jews who warn they may cut political 
and financial support to israel if the new government approves the 
socalled who is a jew legislation 
the change would make ineligible for immigrant status any jew who 
was converted by nonorthodox rabbis jews abroad see the proposal 
as an attack on the reform and conservative movements in judaism

queen elizabeth ii opened a new session of 
parliament today by announcing government plans to force political 
candidates in northern ireland to renounce violence and to impose 
new controls on britains secret service 
the monarch wearing a long white gown and the state imperial 
crown outlined the farreaching legislative program before 
erminerobed peers diplomats and other members of the royal family 
in the house of lords 
by tradition prime minister margaret thatcher whose officials 
wrote the speech and the other members of the house of commons 
stood at the back of the chamber 
the queens speech the 10th written by the conservative 
government since mrs thatcher won power in 1979 also spelled out 
plans to sell off the stateowned water and electricity utilities 
the sales bitterly opposed by the opposition labor party are 
the biggest and most controversial of mrs thatchers massive 
privatization program 
crowds gathered in sunshine and cheered as the 62yearold 
monarch and her husband prince philip traveled to parliament from 
buckingham palace in a new horsedrawn coach a bicentennial gift 
from australia 
the 218000 coach the first new royal coach since 1910 
replaced the irish state coach traditionally used for the state 
opening of parliament the coach drawn by four gray horses was 
decorated at the queens request with a kangaroo and the australian 
coat of arms instead of the royal arms 
australia is among 17 former british colonies that continue to 
recognize the queen as their head of state 
the 10minute speech read by the queen outlined 16 new pieces of 
legislation the government plans to introduce in the coming year 
a bill will be introduced to put the security service on a 
statutory basis said the queen announcing that formal operating 
rules will be drawn up for the first time for britains mi5 
counterintelligence service 
it remained unclear however whether the bill will make the 
service accountable to parliament officials said the measures would 
not apply to mi6 the intelligencegathering service 
some analysts predicted the bill will concentrate on tightening 
mi5 agents oaths of secrecy following the governments failed 
attempt through courts in several countries to suppress the memoirs 
of retired agent peter wright 
wright claimed in his book spycatcher that mi5 tried to 
destabilize the 1970s labor party government bugged foreign 
embassies and plotted to assassinate egyptian president gamal abdul 
nasser 
the proposed new laws include a liberalization of the 1911 
official secrets act although critics note the proposals still 
would not allow civil servants who leak unauthorized documents to 
argue they acted in the public interest 
on northern ireland the queen said legislation will require 
election candidates to make a declaration against terrorism 
the measure is aimed at the outlawed mainly roman catholic irish 
republican army and its legal political front sinn fein the ira is 
fighting to unite northern ireland with the irish republic in a 
single catholic state 
the government will make a new attempt to stop job discrimination 
against the catholic minority in the strifetorn british province 
and propose that all enterprises with as few 10 employees provide 
data on the religious composition of its workers 
the nonviolence pledge proposed for electoral candidates follows 
a ban this fall on broadcast interviews with members of the ira and 
10 other militant northern ireland groups catholic and protestant 
the government provoking charges that it is sacrificing 
democratic principles in an attempt to wipe out the ira also plans 
to end the right of suspects throughout most of the united kingdom 
to remain silent under police interrogation 
other measures included a proposed bill to force soccer fans to 
carry identity cards in a bid to curb the notorious behavior of 
hooligan supporters

amnesty international today accused 
police of beating raping and fatally torturing people in custody in 
the eastern state of bihar 
a spokesman for the indian government refused to comment on the 
report 
the londonbased human rights organization released a report 
accusing bihar police of deliberate unlawful killings and 
illtreatment including rape 
no effective action appears to have been taken impartially to 
investigate abuses or to halt or prevent their occurrence the 
report said 
amnesty said many of the victims were members of lower classes 
including landless laborers campaigning for minimum wages and land 
reform 
some have been assisted by leftwing groups including groups 
which have used violence the report said on the other hand 
landlords assisted by private armies or criminal gangs have also 
resorted to violence 
the report said local landlords or their armies were apparently 
encouraged by the police in some cases 
the report cited an incident in april 1986 in which police fired 
on a public meeting in the village of arwal at least 23 civilians 
were killed the meeting was organized by a leftwing group to 
support claims to a piece of land by nine villagers 
newspapers said an official inquiry into the firing blamed the 
police for using more force than the situation required 
according to amnesty no disciplinary or judicial action was 
taken against any policeman involved in the incident 
bihar is the poorest of indias 25 states its 80 million people 
about onetenth of indias population have an annual per capita 
income of about 110 less than half the national average of 290

james earl ray who pleaded guilty to 
assassinating the rev martin luther king jr says he was framed to 
cover up an fbi plot to kill the civil rights leader and wants the 
government to reopen his case 
ray 60 was sentenced to serve 99 years for kings murder in 
memphis tenn on april 4 1968 the tennessee parole board has 
scheduled a january parole hearing for him but ray says he is not 
hopeful 
i doubt very much theyll give me a parole he said i 
think the only way ill get out of here is through a jury if they 
wouldnt grant me a trial i dont see how theyll grant me a 
parole 
ray pleaded guilty on the day his trial was to begin on march 9 
1969 but recanted three days later and has not received a complete 
trial to prove his innocence 
he alleges the fbi threatened to jail his father and brother if 
he didnt sign a confession rays father was a fugitive from prison 
and his brother spent several years in jail 
in an interview at brushy state prison in east tennessee with 
talk show host morton downey jr ray claimed he was set up in a 
plot to kill king whose calls for economic justice for minorities 
and effective use of nonviolent protest drew the wrath of thenfbi 
director j edgar hoover 
he said the government has refused his requests to review the 
evidence against him has never conducted ballistics tests on the 
alleged murder weapon and has suppressed witnesses and 
investigations that could have cleared him 
since they wont they must be hiding something ray said of 
the fbi the show is scheduled to be aired nov 28 
king was in memphis the day of his assassination to support a 
strike by city sanitation workers seeking higher pay ray was 
identified from fingerprints on a rifle found near the lorraine 
motel in memphis where king was killed as he stood on a balcony 
hosea williams an aide to king present when he was shot said 
during taping monday of the morton downey jr show that ive 
never believed ray killed dr king 
williams said king was convinced that hoovers fbi was plotting 
his death he also said he was surprised to find days after the 
assassination that ray had no political philosophy he was just a 
twobit redneck hustler 
many blacks have expressed anger that the tennessee board has 
scheduled a january parole hearing for ray under a 1985 law 
providing parole hearings for inmates held for 20 years ray became 
eligible for parole consideration this month 
the law was designed to allow the state to relieve prison 
overcrowding 
james m brown chairman of the tennessee voters council and a 
member of the dr martin luther king jr state holiday committee 
called rays parole hearing cruel dangerous and shameful and 
said he would ask gov ned mcwherter to call it off he noted the 
hearing in january would coincide with the jan 16 holiday honoring 
kings birthday 
but mcwherter told reporters monday that he will not interfere 
with the decision of the board which by law is an independent state 
agency

a second straight sharp increase in clothing 
prices associated with the new fall lines sent consumer prices up 
04 percent in october the government said today 
the 18 percent gain in apparel costs was accompanied by a 
moderation in price gains for food which had posted steep 
droughtrelated increases over the summer 
the jump in clothing prices was virtually as steep as the 20 
percent increase posted in september over the last three months 
apparel costs have replaced hospital costs and food prices as the 
greatest stimulant of inflation the labor department said in 
releasing todays report 
the 04 overall october increase would amount to an annual 
inflation rate of 51 percent if it persisted for 12 months the 
annualized rate had declined to 41 percent in september on a large 
drop in gasoline costs 
gasoline prices fell an additional 10 percent in october 
following a 17 percent drop in the preceding month but the 
decrease was not big enough to offset a 14 percent increase in 
electricity and natural gas costs which raised consumer energy 
prices for the month by 01 percent 
food prices rose just 02 percent onefourth the 08 percent 
jump of september on large decreases in prices for fruits and 
vegetables poultry and pork 
fruit and vegetable prices actually fell 11 percent in october 
after rising a total of 129 percent the preceding three months 
because of droughtrelated shortages prices for beef pork and 
poultry last month fell 03 percent 08 percent and 30 percent 
respectively 
offsetting those lower prices was the biggest monthly price 
increase for dairy products since december 1980 09 percent 
cereal and bakery products costs rose 07 percent 
excluding food and energy prices rose 05 percent for the month 
more than half of which was due to sharp increases in clothing 
prices and automobile insurance and finance charges the labor 
department said 
the apparel cost gains reflected the introduction of 
higherpriced fall and winter fashions particularly for womens and 
girls clothing which rose 25 percent after a 35 percent increase 
in september 
shoe prices also rose 25 percent following a 35 percent 
increase the previous month 
automobile insurance and finance charges rose 14 percent and 34 
percent respectively new car prices seasonally adjusted were up 
just 02 percent with prices for 1989 models reflecting a little 
over onefourth of the new car prices surveyed in october the 
1989model prices will continue to be phased in over the next 
several months as they replace 1988 models in dealer showrooms 
medical care costs rose 05 percent halfway between the 
respective 04 percent and 06 percent increases in august and 
september 
in the last year medical costs have risen a total of 67 
percent compared with increases of 52 percent for food 38 
percent for housing and 46 percent for clothing 
the october increases raised the departments consumer price 
index to 1202 that means a basket of goods costing 100 on 
average from 1982 through 1984 would have cost 12020 last month 
up 40 cents from september and compared with a cost of 11530 a 
year ago 
so far this year consumer price inflation has been running at an 
annual rate of 46 percent just a fraction ahead of the 44 percent 
annual rate in 1987 
but there is no doubt that inflation has been accelerating in 
the first three months of 1987 the annual inflation rate was 42 
percent that annualized rate rose to 45 percent in the second 
quarter and 48 percent in the third 
the reagan administration in august had forecast that consumer 
price inflation would slow to 42 percent for all of 1988 and to 39 
percent in 1989 
the 23 percent drop in crude oil prices over the last year has 
been the biggest damper on inflation partially offsetting increases 
of 52 percent for food and 66 percent for medical care 
the respite from large food price increases which had been 
running at an annual inflation rate of more than 9 percent over the 
driest summer in decades was expected to be only temporary 
donald ratajczak who tracks price changes for georgia state 
university said the relief consumers felt at the grocery store from 
lower meat prices the result of early slaughters because of 
droughtdepressed supplies of feed grain would not last 
the opposite effect will prevail next spring as the supply of 
meat animals is reduced forcing prices higher he said

sen edward kennedy laid a white rose 
at the foot of a british memorial to his brother us president 
john f kennedy slain 25 years ago today 
kennedy today walked across a field and climbed a treelined 
stone path to the roughly oblong fivefoot high slab of stone that 
is britains tribute to the assassinated president 
wearing a black trenchcoat he placed the flower at the foot of 
the memorial crossed himself and mouthed a silent prayer 
runnymede 21 miles west of london was chosen as the site for 
the memorial because it was here in 1215 that king john sealed the 
magna carta the great charter regarded as the foundation of british 
human rights 
kennedy came here with three english friends of the family dinah 
bridge lady anne tree and chiquita astor as well as american 
artist james wyeth painter of a celebrated portrait of president 
kennedy and historical author larry collins 
the massachusetts democrat is in britain on a private trip and he 
visited runnymede with little advance publicity 
kennedy told a reporter the memorial had a special meaning to 
all the members of the family and i welcome the chance to come out 
with some of the close friends dear friends of president 
kennedy 
my sister kathleens and my brother joes lives were lost not 
far from here he said kathleen was killed in a plane crash over 
northern france in 1948 and joseph went down with his world war ii 
bomber over eastern england in 1944 
kennedy declined to elaborate on his feelings on the 25th 
anniversary of his brothers death saying we think its 
extremely important to celebrate the life of president kennedy 
rather than the tragedy were focusing on the birthday may 29 and 
the hope of his life rather than dwelling upon his loss 
the anniversary attracted a trickle of british kennedy admirers 
to the memorial among the first was daphne james 44 a publishing 
company secretary who said she needed to be somewhere where you 
feel youre close to him for a little while 
mrs james was at home on nov 22 1963 when news of the 
assassination in dallas reached britain 
i think i spent about 2 hours crying solidly though i was 
trying to get a family to bed she said 
he was special and i want for us not to forget he was a special 
person 
the memorial paid for by public donations was unveiled in 1965 
and carries an inscription from kennedys own words we shall pay 
any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend or 
oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and success of 
liberty 
it stands on the side of the hill not on top to symbolize a 
life cut short before its time

a group of americans hoping to publicize 
a 24 million reward for the release of any american prisoners of 
war plan to float 600 tiny boats across the river dividing thailand 
from laos 
each foam vessel to be floated wednesday is six inches in 
diameter and will carry a rolled message in thai pinned with a 
bamboo toothpick reading 
this boat represents one of about 600 americans who are still 
unaccounted for in laos may this effort appease the spirits of 
those who have died and help bring back to their families those who 
are still living 
the us state department lists 2393 americans as missing in 
action in laos vietnam and cambodia after the indochina war which 
ended in 1975 with communist victories in recent months 
cooperation between the united states and the governments of laos 
and vietnam has increased in an effort to resolve the issue 
the state department has criticized private efforts to resolve 
the issue 
geographer michael b caron of lawrence kan said he and three 
other americans hope to gather information on americans they believe 
are still being held prisoner laos has repeatedly denied it holds 
any americans 
of the 2393 mia cases the state department has classified 1128 
as killed in actionbody not recovered the other 1265 were 
labeled prisoner of warmissing in action but all but one case 
were changed to the status of presumed dead 
 
the four americans who are based in the northeastern province of 
nakhon phanom bordering laos are members of homecoming ii a 
private miapow group based in shawnee mission kan 
they say they will enlist the help of thai children to help them 
transport and float the small craft on the mekong river at sunset 
wednesday 
two other americans on a similiar mission crossed the mekong and 
entered laos illegaly on oct 3 to advertise the reward financed 
by donations from us congressmen and private individuals 
donna long and james copp both from north carolina were 
arrested and imprisoned for 41 days they were released after a us 
veterans group paid 1500 in administrative fees and canceled a 
planned protest 
wednesdays planned launch of the messages coincides with the 
ancient thai loy krathong festival when banana leaf boats are 
floated and prayers offered to the water spirits 
our intention is to stay out of trouble not to set off 
instant negative alarm that could come back and hurt the thais 
said caron 
he said he and his colleagues arrived in thailand three weeks ago

members of the national islamic front marching through the center of 
the capital khartoum

lt gov mike callihan served an allcolorado 
thanksgiving meal to a group of needy american indians from the back 
of a mayflower moving van provoking protests from some indians who 
called the act disgusting 
mondays meal a promotion for the lieutenant governors always 
buy colorado program featured coloradogrown buffalo lamb and 
rainbow trout vegetables and multigrain plains bread 
callihan said the event in front of the capitol was a thank 
you to the indians for providing food for americas first 
thanksgiving for the pilgrims 367 years ago 
but a quiet group of protesters from the american indian movement 
stood near the moving van that was provided by a local mayflower 
moving company and passed out a statement to reporters that said the 
meal was disgusting 
the plan to serve hungry members of the american indian 
community of denver in back of a mayflower moving van not only 
cheapens one of the greatest expressions of sharing by indigenous 
people with europeans but it also serves to exploit for commercial 
gain the most disadvantaged people in the united states such 
methods would not and should not be tolerated by any other racial or 
ethnic group in this country the statement read 
homer eagle feather who was one of about a dozen indians who 
were served the meal said he didnt care about the protest and 
thought the meal was very nice and very appropriate 
guests for the meal were selected by several indian service 
organizations in the denver area 
callihan who chairs the colorado commission of indian affairs 
had billed the dinner as thanksgiving on the mayflower 
every major indian service agency in metro denver was asked to 
comment on the idea and supported it callihan said they also 
sent a list of people they would like to have attend the indian 
commission staff actually put this together the critics who are 
here are also the ones who dont attend any meetings 
the mayflower was the ship on which the pilgrims sailed to 
plymouth rock in 1620 to found one of the first colonies in the new 
world marking a key step in the end of indian domination of north 
america

psychiatry was systematically used in the 1970s to 
suppress soviet dissidents by declaring them mentally ill and 
committing them to asylums a doctor wrote in the first article 
printed by staterun media to acknowledge such abuses 
the leadership was content in our country there were no 
dissidents there were only insane people mikhail i buyanov a 
psychiatrist and neurologist wrote in his historical survey of 
soviet psychiatry published by the educational newspaper 
uchitelskaya gazeta 
human rights activists in the soviet union and abroad have 
alleged for years that the kremlin used psychiatric hospitals to 
incarcerate dissidents who were in fact mentally healthy some say 
the practice began under josef v stalin or nikita s khrushchev 
the government enacted a new law in january that makes it a crime 
to commit a sane person to a mental institution but public health 
officials who have appeared at moscow news conferences have denied 
that dissidents were systematically confined to asylums or avoided 
answering the question 
however buyanov wrote that with the forcible confinement in 1970 
of biologist and dissident writer zhores medevdev to a regional 
psychiatric hospital in kaluga a new chapter began in the history 
of soviet psychiatry 
its true that before this people were sent to psychiatric 
hospitals for reasons that were mostly political rather than of a 
medical character buyanov said but after 1970 this was done 
more and more often 
medvedev the brother of marxist historian roy medvedev was 
freed after human rights activist andrei sakharov poet and editor 
andrei tvardovsky and others demanded his immediate release he now 
lives in britain 
anatoly koryagin himself a psychiatrist was sentenced to seven 
years in a prison camp in 1981 after accusing soviet authorities of 
sending mentally healthy dissidents to hospitals where they were 
forced to take drugs 
those whose confinement koryagin protested were expressing the 
same opinions by the way as were later heard from the tribune at 
the 27th congress of the soviet communist party and the 19th 
allunion party conference after mikhail s gorbachev became 
soviet leader in 1985 buyanov wrote 
koryagin was pardoned by parliament last year freed from labor 
camp and emigrated to switzerland the government later stripped him 
of citizenship for causing damage to the prestige of the soviet 
union 
because of the abuses outlined by koryagin the united states and 
britain considered trying to suspend or expel the soviet union from 
the world psychiatry association the soviets withdrew from the 
association in 1983 before a drive to expel them could be organized 
buyanov gave no figures for the number of dissidents sent to 
mental hospitals but said local party and police officials put 
pressure on psychiatrists to declare them insane 
although the ministry of health instructed psychiatrists to 
ignore the opinions of nonprofessionals moscow was far away and 
the local city party secretary was right next door he wrote 
a definition of schizophrenia a psychotic disorder that was 
advanced by soviet health specialists citing marxistleninist 
doctrine also enabled psychiatrists to diagnose the ailment in sane 
people buyanov wrote in the article published by uchitelskaya 
gazeta on saturday 
under leonid i brezhnev soviet leader from 1964 to 1982 
psychiatrists gave law enforcement officials the notion that 
anyone who is against anything it doesnt matter what is a 
covert or overt mental case more likely a psychopath or a latent 
schizophrenic buyanov said 
he praised measures taken earlier this year by the health 
ministry to improve the care of psychiatric patients but said past 
abuses must be recognized we have made mistakes we have made 
them knowingly he said 
soviet psychiatrists also must be able to ignore pressure from 
authorities and threatening telephone calls and threats from 
above buyanov said 
in february modest m kabanov a leningrad psychiatrist 
acknowledged at a news conference that some doctors in the past 
decided to send people to institutions for reading bulgakovs 
works or for reading pasternaks verses and poems 
works by the those two soviet authors mikhail bulgakov and boris 
pasternak had been banned here until gorbachev instituted his 
campaign for greater openness 
however kabanov and other doctors who appeared at the news 
conference skirted the question of whether psychiatry had been used 
in the soviet union to stifle dissent

former president ferdinand marcos has 
asked a philippine court to allow him to return to his country 
marcos filed a petition monday asking a manila court to 
reconsider a decision last month that banned the exiled leader from 
returning to his country to answer testimony against him previously 
lawyers for marcos have said he was too ill to travel from hawaii to 
new york to hear us charges against him 
the court ruled the issue was a political matter that could 
be resolved only by president corazon aquino who refused to allow 
marcos to return for security reasons mrs aquino came to power 
after marcos was ousted in a civilianmilitary uprising in february 
1986 
marcos and his wife imelda were indicted in new york last month 
on charges they diverted 103 million of philippine government funds 
to purchase new york real estate 
mrs marcos was arraigned on oct 31 before a new york federal 
court and pleaded not guilty her husbands arraignment was 
postponed indefinitely after his lawyers claimed he was too frail to 
make the 10hour flight from his exile in hawaii to new york 
doctors have said marcos 71 has calcium deposits in his knee 
joints making it hard for him to walk and forcing him to use a 
wheelchair his aides also have said marcos suffered from chest 
pains severe headaches and an eye ailment 
officials at the sandiganbayan court in manila said the latest 
marcos petition was filed on his behalf by his sister fortuna 
marcosbarba 
in the petition marcos asked the court to block the scheduled 
dec 11 deposition by former public works and highways minister 
baltazar aquino unless it is done in marcos presence the former 
minister is not related to mrs aquino 
government lawyers say former minister aquino has agreed to 
testify in the dec 11 proceedings about alleged kickbacks marcos 
received from japanese companies during his 20year term in office 
marcos said that unless he is allowed to return to manila for the 
deposition the court and the philippine government would be 
guilty of trial by publicity 
government lawyers say they plan to use aquinos testimony 
against marcos when philippine criminal charges are filed against 
him and he is eventually allowed to return to face them the lawyers 
say the former ministers testimony has to be taken soon because he 
is ill and may die before marcos is brought to trial 
in his petition marcos argued that unless he is allowed to 
crossexamine baltazar aquino the testimony of the latter will not 
be valid 
the court has given no indication if it will hold hearings on the 
latest marcos petition or dismiss it

officials say the finding that four 
young adults had been drinking and two were legally drunk when 
their car plunged into a new haven river does not end the 
investigation into their deaths 
deputy chief medical examiner h wayne carver ii said monday that 
it was not yet possible to determine what role alcohol played in the 
accident 
the tests found bloodalcohol levels ranging from 006 and 011 
in the four under state law a person is legally drunk with a 
bloodalcohol level of 010 
the four 1987 graduates of east lyme high school michael r 
gallo 20 jill s sawyer christy s stevens and laura m 
lagrotteria all 19 drowned early nov 13 after the car they were 
riding in plunged into the mill river at a swing bridge that was in 
its open position 
they were missing for several days prompting a nationwide 
search before the submerged car was found last thursday 
the bridge which pivots on a central axis has been out of use 
since august 1987 and is locked in its open position perpendicular 
to the road to allow boat traffic to pass by 
carver declined to say which victims had the higher bloodalcohol 
level readings and authorities have said they havent determined 
who was driving the car the car was owned by stevens 
the bloodalcohol levels correspond roughly to consumption of 
between 1 and five drinks state associate medical examiner edward 
t mcdonough said police have said that a case of beer most of it 
consumed was found inside the sunken car 
the youths all of east lyme were reported missing by their 
parents in the evening of nov 13 about 24 hours after they left 
their homes for a night out in new haven 
city officials have conceded that there was a gap in concrete 
barriers at the bridge the night of crash officials have said there 
was a time when the twoton concrete barriers completely blocked the 
road but they have been unable to say why or when the blocks were 
moved 
robert i reardon jr an attorney for stevens family said the 
bloodalcohol levels were inconsequential 
virtually anyone driving down that road at night would have 
driven off the bridge he said

new york states highest court today upheld 
bernhard goetzs conviction for illegal gun possession stemming from 
his shooting of four men on a new york city subway car in 1984 
the unanimous unsigned ruling by the state court of appeals said 
that the judge at goetzs trial stephen crane did not err in his 
charge to the jury goetzs attorneys had contended that cranes 
comments unfairly resulted in their clients conviction 
the court of appeals also determined today that a decision by a 
midlevel state appeals court rejecting the sentence crane handed out 
to goetz on the gun possession conviction was proper 
todays decision means that goetz must be resentenced for his 
june 1987 conviction for thirddegree criminal possession of a 
weapon 
crane originally sentenced goetz to six months in jail a 5000 
fine 280 hours of community service five years probation and 
psychiatric counseling 
but earlier this year the midlevel appeals court decided that 
goetz should have been given an indeterminate sentence or under 
terms of new yorks tough guncontrol law a oneyear term with no 
probation 
neither the appellate division nor the state court of appeals 
today reinstated any of the more serious charges against goetz that 
his trial jury acquitted him of 
the december 1984 shooting touched off a storm of controversy 
about vigilantism and about racial justice goetz is white while 
the shooting victims are all black 
goetz argued that he fired in selfdefense because he believed he 
was about to be mugged while the young men said that they were only 
panhandling 
civil suits against goetz also are pending according to his 
attorney mark baker 
while all of the men goetz shot survived the shootings one has 
been left partially paralyzed and suffered brain damage 
baker had argued before the court of appeals that cranes charge 
to the trial jurors last year that they must convict if they 
found the prosecution had proven its case amounted to taking away 
the jurys consitutionally granted discretion baker said the judge 
should have used the word may 
but the court of appeals concluded today that the trial court 
did not err in instructing the jury 
the court said the jury in the goetz case still had the option of 
acquitting the gunman even if it had found that the prosecution had 
proven its case

a connecticut woman testifying at the 
conspiracy trial of political maverick lyndon h larouche jr said 
today a larouche fundraiser deceived her by telling her 2000 in 
political contributions were loans 
as defense lawyers tried to show that prosecution witness 
elizabeth sexton was a willing supporter of larouche the woman who 
loaned nearly 113000 to a laroucheaffiliated organization that 
was never repaid insisted she was misled by fundraiser joyce 
rubenstein 
at the opening of the trial of larouche and six associates 
monday ms sexton said ms rubenstein repeatedly promised her the 
loans would be repaid at interest rates of up to 175 percent 
today ms rubensteins lawyer ed williams showed the 
75yearold witness two 1000 checks made out to campaign 
organizations of the minorparty presidential candidate in may 1985 
ms sexton said those checks were written at the request of ms 
rubenstein adding it was not explained to me that these were 
political contributions i thought they were loans 
asked by williams why she did not write the promised interest 
rate on the memo section of the checks as she did with the nearly 
113000 in loan money ms sexton said she did so but it was 
whited out 
larouche is charged along with six associates with mail fraud and 
conspiracy to commit mail fraud for allegedly raising more than 30 
million in loans with no intent of repaying them 
larouche also is charged with conspiracy to defraud the internal 
revenue service by filing no returns since 1979 while having all 
personal expenses paid from funds of various corporations he 
controls 
conviction on all counts could carry a prison term of 65 years 
and fines of 325 million 
defense lawyers told jurors in opening statements monday that 
there was no intent to defraud those lending money to larouche 
organizations but they contended repayment became impossible when 
larouche and associates were forced to divert funds toward resisting 
attacks from the government and news media 
prosecutors began to carefully lay out their case by calling ms 
sexton a grayhaired matronly looking woman who said the series of 
loans she made in 1985 came from money my husband left me my 
working capital 
speaking in a firm voice that occasionally rose in anger as she 
recounted the loss of 112800 ms sexton said she repeatedly told 
larouche fundraiser joyce rubinstein a defendant that i could 
not afford to live without the investment money 
but ms sexton admitted she willingly loaned the money to caucus 
distributors inc described by prosecutors as a larouche 
organization because ms rubinstein said it was needed to publish 
a book against drugs 
nancy reagan asked everyone to get involved ms sexton said 
adding she thought she was doing just that and helping her three 
grandchildren too by financing the book project 
she acknowledged under cross examination the book was published 
in spanish for distribution in latin america ms sexton said she 
thought her money would get the book translated into english 
as assistant us attorney john markham guided her through the 
story he asked the witness if she considered the loan risky 
sitting ramrod straight in the witness chair ms sexton shot 
back joyce assured me my money was safer than with my bank or any 
of my investments 
ms sexton related how ms rubinstein kept pressing her to lend 
more money and when the barrel ran dry the witness said she 
complied with the fundraisers request to get a bank loan 
in his opening statement assistant us attorney kent s 
robinson told jurors we are not here to judge the politics of 
larouche whose views are often described in published reports as 
extreme 
robinson said that during the alleged loan scam lasting from 
1983 through 1987 larouche imposed quotas on fundraisers and told 
them people who didnt give were not morally fit to survive 
robinson said the fundraisers promised lenders high interest 
rates and repayment on a quarterly basis and sent promissory notes 
through the mail 
defense attorneys countered that larouche and the codefendants 
had no intention of defrauding those who loaned the more than 30 
million but only received about 3 million in repayments 
odin anderson larouches attorney told jurors tat larouche had 
ordered that loans made to his organization be fully repaid and told 
his staff that it would be political suicide not to pay back 
supporters 
anderson admitted his client failed to file income tax returns 
but argued there was no intent to evade the law 
the attorney said larouche had no personal income and had a 
goodfaith belief that he was not obligated to file 
another defense attorney michael reilly blamed the inability to 
pay back the loans on attacks on larouche by the most powerful 
forces in the country including the fbi internal revenue 
service the news media state law enforcement organizations and the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith 
larouche was indicted in october on 13 counts of mail fraud 
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the irs 
conviction on all counts could carry a prison term of 65 years and 
fines of 325 million 
six of his associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the 
mail fraud and conspiracy charges 
larouches codefendants are william wertz chief fundraiser 
his chief legal adviser edward spannaus and four fundraisers 
michael billington dennis small paul greenberg and ms rubinstein

australia and the united states have 
extended their agreement on two us military bases for another 10 
years prime minister bob hawke told parliament today 
in washington a state department official confirmed hawkes 
statement and said the united states was pleased the agreement was 
extended 
the pine gap and nurrunga space satellite facilities had until 
now operated under agreements that could be terminated at one years 
notice by either side hawke said 
we do not regard this as satisfactory both because of the 
continuing importance of the bases effective operation to global 
peace and because of the specific benefits to australia of longterm 
access to their capabilities the prime minister said 
we have further agreed that three years notice shall be 
required to terminate the agreement he said 
he said the united states has also agreed to allow more 
australian involvement in the management of the bases 
hawke said that until the early 1980s only about 10 percent of 
the staff at the bases were australian he said that under the new 
agreement the australian staff will increase to about 30 percent of 
the employees 
another usrun base at northwest cape whose military function 
is less sensitive than that of pine gap and nurrunga is not subject 
to the new agreement 
australian officials said the number of us military personnel 
in australia is classified information

us district judge john h pratt ruled today 
that a lawsuit filed here to block the deportation of 13 mariel 
boatlift detainees to cuba must be consolidated with a similar one 
brought earlier in alabama 
pratt signed an order to transfer the case to birmingham after 
hearing arguments and rejecting a request for a temporary 
restraining order to block the justice department from returning the 
13 detainees now in a penitentiary in talladega ala to cuba 
im satisfied that this case should be transferred to 
alabama pratt said from the bench there is a similar but not 
identical case in the alabama jurisdiction we have to have these 
cases decided by a single judge in a single jurisdiction 
laurence eisenstein representing the 13 detainees had argued 
that the case in birmingham was based on different issues than the 
lawsuit he filed in the district of columbia 
eisenstein said the birmingham case involving 15 individual 
detainees involved immigration issues while his classaction suit 
filed here dealt with the constitutionality of the justice 
departments administrative procedures on deportation such as a 
denial of judicial review of such an action 
pratt replied i can tell you that if these two cases were 
filed in this court the judge in the first case would have received 
the second one under consolidation 
assistant us attorney edith marshall representing the 
immigration and naturalization service argued that the cases had to 
be consolidated because many issues such as harm to the public 
interest harm to the united states and uscuban relations were 
the same 
it is judicial inefficiecy for two courts to hear these 
cases she said 
the justice department announced last week that panels 
established in the wake of last years prison riots by the boatlift 
detainees had reviewed their first 28 cases and planned to send at 
least 15 of the prisoners back to cuba in the near future 
a suit on behalf of the 15 was filed in birmingham in an attempt 
to block the deportations two of the 15 declined to join in the 
classaction suit filed here 
the 15 the department said should be repatriated have convictions 
ranging from petty larceny to seconddegree murder most of them 
have more than one conviction 
the threemember justice department panels will undertake further 
consideration of the remaining 13 detainees in the initial review 
group to determine whether they should be returned to cuba or be 
released 
the detainees are among 125000 people who came to the united 
states in 1980 in a boatlift from mariel cuba the vast majority of 
them have been lawabiding us residents

the transfer of the body of 
heiress christina onassis to a greek island for burial has been held 
up by judicial authorities pending the determination of the exact 
cause of death 
a preliminary coroners report said monday the cause of death was 
acute pulmonary edema or the accumulation of fluid in her lungs 
ms onassis 37 died saturday at the country home of her 
friends albert and marina dodero a doctor at clinica del sol 
hospital in buenos aires where the body was first taken said the 
cause of death was a heart attack 
heart attacks can cause an accumulation of fluid in the lungs 
but the coroners report did not say what caused the buildup 
ms onassis mother athena died in 1974 at the age of 45 and 
medical reports said at the time that she also had died from a 
pulmonary edema 
forensic experts were analyzing ms onassis body tissue and 
other evidence to determine whether drugs figured in her death 
juan carlos cardinali one of three judges handling the case was 
quoted by the private news agency noticias argentinas as saying the 
investigation was focusing on the possible overdose of barbiturates 
family members and friends ruled out suicide 
they said ms onassis heiress to the fortune of shipping tycoon 
aristotle onassis appeared happy in her final days and was 
considering the purchase of an apartment in buenos aires 
unconfirmed local news reports said ms onassis planned to marry 
jorge tchomlekdjoglou the brother of marina dodero ms onassis 
first four marriages ended in divorce 
family members declined to comment i know nothing about that 
wedding said alberto dodero marinas fatherinlaw 
the full coroners report was expected this week it was unclear 
whether the report would be publicly disclosed 
a determination that ms onassis died of natural causes would 
allow the transfer of her body to the familyowned island of 
skorpios off greece for burial beside her father and brother 
alexander who died in a 1973 plane crash 
her fourth husband french industrialist thierry roussel arrived 
from geneva on monday to help resolve legal proceedings 
roussel is the father of ms onassis only child 3yearold 
athena who will inherit her entire fortune estimated at 1 billion 
in athens greece a source close to the onassis family said ms 
onassis will be buried on saturday if argentine authorities releases 
her body within the next 48 hours 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said ms 
onassis body will be flown to athens for public funeral service 
tentatively scheduled for friday roussel is expected to accompany 
the body the source said 
the source said ms onassis daughter athena would probably not 
be flown from switzerland for the funeral 
the public will be able to pay respects to ms onassis in a greek 
orthodox church in the athens suburb of nea smirni on saturday the 
body is to be flown to northwest greece where it will be placed 
aboard a launch for the short trip to skorpios said the source 
the burial service on skorpios will be strictly private with 
only relatives and very close friends in attendance said ioannis 
georgakis a business advisor to the onassis family 
ms onassis will be buried next to her father and brother in a 
mausoleum adjoining a tiny chapel on a hill in the center of the 
island 
aristotle onassis died in paris in 1975

one of the seven bodies found buried 
outside a boardinghouse was identified as that of an alcoholic who 
spent most of his life on the streets but authorities dont know 
how he or the others died 
the body of benjamin fink 60 a former resident of dorothea 
puentes victorian boardinghouse in downtown sacramento was 
identified monday through fingerprints said sacramento county 
coroner charles simmons 
no further information was released on fink his brother robert 
told reporters last week that fink had been a chronic alcoholic 
since age 17 who spent most of his life on the streets in 
sacramento and had moved into the puente boardinghouse earlier this 
year 
puente 59 remained in jail without bail on a murder charge 
authorities said they expected to file further charges soon 
in sworn statements filed monday in sacramento municipal court 
police said that searches of the boardinghouse have turned up carpet 
stained with blood and a handwritten book that may be puentes diary 
during two searches of the twostory woodframe house police 
seized papers photographs and books including a paperback titled 
the smell of evil according to the court documents among the 
seized papers are some pertaining to funeral plots 
police detective les murphy said last week in an affidavit to 
support a warrant to search the house for a second time that a 
former boardinghouse tenant told investigators puente kept a 
personal biography inside the house court documents dont say who 
owns the handwritten book seized by police 
the statements filed monday to show what was found as a result of 
the searches the first nov 15 and the second over last weekend 
murphy said blood and body fluids found on carpeting during the 
first search appear to be similar to carpeting recovered from one 
of the graves of the bodies found in the yard 
simmons said his office had completed autopsies on six of the 
seven victims and would finish the seventh autopsy today he said a 
final report including toxicology studies would not be completed 
until sometime next week 
despite the extreme decomposition of most of the bodies good 
fingerprints were obtained from at least three and there are still 
better than 5050 chances of determining the cause of death the 
coroner said 
the sixth victim whose autopsy was completed monday was a woman 
more than 50 years old whose body was fully dressed and wrapped in a 
sheet simmons said he said she had been buried for several 
months at least 
with the seventh autopsy pending that brings the victim total to 
three men and three women 
simmons said authorities working from a list of about 25 missing 
people known to have lived in puentes home at one time or another 
have found six or seven people and removed them from the list 
detectives say they believe puente killed elderly boarders and 
hid their bodies in order to collect their social security checks 
in a television interview after her arrest wednesday she said 
she didnt kill anyone but admitted the checks i cashed yes

from rate cuts mandated by proposition 103 state officials reported 
department of insurance officials identified the 11 companies 
but declined to release copies of the exemption requests 
proposition 103 mandates that such copies be made public but 
reid mcclaran staff attorney for the state department of insurance 
said monday that the law is not in effect because it has been stayed 
by the state supreme court pending a review 
insurers are eligible for an exemption from proposition 103s 
rate rollbacks if they can prove the reductions will force them out

to get the entire law thrown out 
the 11 companies filing for exemptions include farmers insurance

auto association automobile club of southern california 
interinsurance exchange 20th century and mercury insurance which 
are five of the states 10 biggest auto insurers 
the other six companies are williamsburg national insurance co 
national automobile and casualty insurance co california casualty

accept the will of the people and want to function as if the old 
rules still apply which is not the case he said 
state sen alan robbins chairman of the senate insurance 
committee said he would subpoena insurance commissioner roxani 
gillespie for the records if she refuses to release them 
meanwhile the los angeles times reported today that ms 
gillespie plans to add 300 employees to her 515member staff and 
increase her offices annual budget by 18 million to enforce

represent the executive branch in deficit talks with the congress 
i too will be handson in talking directly with members of 
congress on both sides of the aisle he told republican governors

budget deficit is not taxes

conference in a crowded ballroom of the grand hotel resort on the 
alabama coast the gop governors earlier had stressed that close 
ties already have been formed between the new white house team and 
republican statehouses 
bush said the 1990s can be the the decade of cooperation 
with the party offering compassion along with leadership this is 
a time for bringing people together he said 
simply put i mean to continue what ronald reagan and i began 
in 1980 to stop the flow of power to washington and return it 
where it belongs to the states i mean to continue this tradition 
because it has worked and because it is consistent with our partys 
philosophy bush said 
i believe all of us share the same goal a land of limited 
government and unlimited opportunity he said 
bush called on the gop governors to work with the administration 
to provide compassionate and responsible leadership as 
republicans lets work together and i mean this to be the party 
of all the people our ideas are right 
he also touched on themes expressed earlier in the fourday gop 
governors conference by members of the new white house team 
including the goal of expanding the republican party at all levels 
of government 
my point is that we are on our way to becoming the majority 
party in america if we dont lose sight of what is driving our 
success he said

the party has won enough key states and geographic territory that it 
could and should win the presidency right on through the next 
century

initial cabinet selections and will be developing a defense team 
probably after a break for the thanksgiving holiday

the presidential campaign and giving it an element of racial 
divisiveness said the party has an opportunity in the black 
community which has voted heavily democratic in the conference

crowd of perhaps 400

national celebrity im not going to try to be a statesman that 
aint me

over the gulf of mexico toward an expected florida landfall after 
drenching a stretch from mexico to the florida keys and forcing the 
evacuation of 2500 people in cuba 
forecasters said the storm still packed winds near 65 mph and 
emergency planning officials urged people along floridas gulf coast 
to batten down and brace for heavy rains and winds today 
however forecasters at the national hurricane center said a cold 
front from the north was mingling with storm keith in the gulf of 
mexico keeping it from strengthening to hurricane status 
its extremely unlikely it would strengthen said forecaster 
colin mcadie it will lose strength as it crosses land 
earlier today keiths winds were put at 65 mph but the 11 am

the consumer product safety commission today 
defended its efforts to rid the market of toys that can be dangerous 
to children one day after a consumer group accused the commission 
of pitiful ineptitude 
i clearly dont agree with their allegations we spend 12 
months out of every year trying to address toy safety said anne 
graham commissioner of the safety commission 
on the other hand im appreciative of the ada for bringing the 
toys that theyre concerned about to our attention our compliance 
unit will be looking at them immediately and determining if theyre 
safe or not if theyre not well take measures to get them off the 
market she said 
the consumer affairs committee of the americans for democratic 
action issued its 17th annual report on monday and criticized the 
commission the federal agency charged with overseeing consumer 
goods 
a major reason for the abundance of dangerous toys is the 
pitiful ineptitude of the cpsc the ada report said 
at todays news conference the commission displayed some of the 
toys it had recalled in 1988 it also emphasized that parents should 
heed the cautionary labels on some products including warnings on 
balloons 
the commission said that in the 15 years since the agencys 
inception 115 deaths have been associated with balloons some 
children have suffocated when they picked up broken balloons 
inhaled the pieces and choked on them 
toys caused 131000 injuries last year including 105000 to 
children under 15 according to the safety commission 
two types of toys to avoid the ada said are baby walkers and 
crib gyms the walkers can tip over or fall down stairs while the 
gyms are responsible for a dozen deaths and 662 other injuries in 
the past five years the report said 
accidents involving baby walkers occur when steps or stairways 
are not blocked or doors are not closed john preston a mechanical 
engineer with the commission told reporters at the agencys annual 
holiday safety news conference he encouraged close parental 
supervision 
as far as baby walkers are concerned there arent any specific 
defects ms graham said 
commission spokeswoman elaine tyrrell demonstrated how a crib gym 
could become dangerous for a child who is able to stand usually 
about the age of six months 
a child could get entangled in the toy which stretches across a 
crib and strangulation deaths have occured she urged parents to 
remove the toy once a child becomes more active 
the commission said parents shopping for childrens presents this 
holiday season must consider the play environment as well as 
skills and abilities of the child when toy purchases are made 
the ada report recommended some basic safety guidelines for 
christmasshopping parents 
look for sharp edges small parts projectiles and potential 
danger if the toy breaks toys with fabric in them should say the 
material is flame retardant or flame resistant painted toys should 
be nontoxic 
read the directions avoid toys with instructions that are too 
complicated 
consider the childs age good toys should not require constant 
supervision to ensure safety or correct use also watch for 
inadequate or misleading age labels

chester a crocker a principal architect of 
the agreement to remove foreign forces from southwestern africa has 
pursued that objective virtually from the day he joined the reagan 
administration almost eight years ago 
his perseverence began to pay off this past spring when he 
persuaded the governments of south africa cuba and angola to begin 
a negotiating process under his mediation 
now with south african acceptance of a plan approved last friday 
by the governments of angola and cuba crockers patience has paid 
off 
the plan basically calls for namibian independence from 73 years 
of south african colonial rule and the phased withdrawal over 27 
months of the more than 50000 cuban troops from angola namibias 
northern neighbor 
crocker has long believed that achievement of these two 
objectives could usher in a period of stability and harmony in a 
region that has known neither for years 
another crocker aim has been to free the area from superpower 
competition but that goal apparently will elude him the agreement 
does not resolve the angolan civil war in which the united states 
and the soviet union have been arming opposite sides 
it was no small achievement for an american diplomat to be 
accepted as mediator by three countries with which the united states 
has relations ranging from poor to nonexistent 
us ties with south africa have been strained for years and the 
united states has no diplomatic relations with angola washington 
and havana have only small diplomatic missions in each others 
capital and disagree on almost everything 
but crocker felt all along that his approach offered something to 
each participant in the areas protracted struggles and gently 
prodded them toward agreement 
for south africa namibian independence will mean an end to a 
long and costly colonial rule by pretoria 
for angola the withdrawal of south african forces from namibia 
means an end to south african support for anticommunist rebels in 
angola 
as for cuba president fidel castro can claim a major role in 
extricating namibia africas last colony from south african rule 
it also will bring an end by early 1991 to a foreign adventure 
that has claimed thousands of cuban casualties since cuban troops 
first began arriving in angola in 1975 
crocker who turned 47 in october joined the state department 
after administration talent scouts were impressed by an article he 
wrote on south africa policy in foreign affairs magazine in 1980 
he had spent the previous eight years associated with georgetown 
university the last five of which he served as director of african 
studies at the universitys center for strategic and international 
studies 
since then crocker has acquired a reputation for among other 
things durability while the four other regional bureaus at the 
state department latin america the middle east europe and asia 
each have had three assistant secretaries during reagans tenure 
crocker has been the only head of the africa bureau in that period 
his scholarly demeanor reflects his long years of academic 
pursuits which include a doctorate from johns hopkins university 
at the state department he was recognized early on by his 
colleagues as one of the few bona fide intellectuals holding high 
government office 
crocker is married to a rhodesia native and has three daughters

preschool children asked about the meaning 
of thanksgiving gave some answers that were real turkeys but they 
had clear ideas on how to improve the holiday according to a 
toymakers survey 
its a holiday where benjamin franklin discovered pumpkins 
one 6yearold girl from denver told the pollsters from playskool a 
division of the pawtucketbased hasbro inc 
its when the pilgrims invited the italians over for dinner 
another said 
and pupils in denver at 80 percent gave the highest number of 
right answers of the day care centers surveyed in atlanta 
cincinnati denver los angeles and nashua nh cincinnati at 60 
percent had the lowest score 
the september survey of 150 children aged 4 to 6 found about 
onethird of them had no idea of the meaning of thanksgiving said 
amy friedland a playskool spokeswoman 
the standards were high friedland explained 
another 6yearold denver girl for example gave the incorrect 
answer when she said you eat dinner when its time you eat lunch 
when its time and then you go to bed 
but the childrens lack of knowledge didnt prevent them from 
suggesting some improvements 
a 5yearold los angeles girl said she would prefer a cake ice 
cream hot dogs and something to drink to the traditional turkey 
dinner 
the children also suggested french fries and macaroni and cheese 
be substituted for mashed potatoes and stuffing and ice cream and 
jello replace the pumpkin pie 
the survey taken by playskool to get an idea of childrens 
interest in the holiday showed differences in who takes care of the 
afterdinner cleanup 
eighty percent of the children surveyed in denver said their 
mothers did the dishes while only 53 percent of the los angeles 
kids said the same thing 
forty percent of the fathers in altanta pitched in but only 3 
percent of dads in cincinnati helped the survey showed 
maybe thats because the fathers were too full to move almost 50 
of the children said their father eats the most at thanksgiving 
dinner eighteen percent said they had the largest appetites and one 
denver girl said dogs and cats ate the largest share of the turkey 
most likely from scraps fed under the table freidland

commissioner now charged in an alleged divorcefixing scheme 
stared intently at koch

described as very important in the mayoral race i won in 1977 
koch said nothing to reporters when he arrived in his limousine 
at the federal courthouse shortly after 1030 am he was 
accompanied by his counsel hank white and by mayoral advisor dan 
wolf 
he appointed the myerson as city cultural affairs commissioner in 
1983

estranged wife 
the federal court trial of miss myerson capasso 43 and former 
state supreme court justice hortense gabel 75 entered its eighth

twentythree years before the pilgrims sat 
down to their famous feast of turkey in 1621 spanish colonists held 
a thanksgiving banquet of fish and fowl along the rio grande texas 
historians say 
the people in massachusetts are probably not going to like the 
idea said sheldon hall himself a mayflower descendant and 
president of a group that claims the first thanksgiving was held 
april 30 1598 south of el paso the group plans to recreate the 
dinner next april 30 
its going to create a lot of talk its going to create a big 
historical correction he said the reaction in spain is going 
to be wonderful 
amateur and professional historians in el paso members of the 
mission trail association arent trying to rewrite history but 
they want to pay the early spanish explorers and colonizers their 
due 
their efforts are aided by the detailed records on the journey by 
juan de onate who led a 400member party from what is now southern 
chihuahua state mexico to presentday northern new mexico near 
santa fe capt gaspar perez de villagra chronicled the trip 
it took the party of 130 men 270 women and children and 7000 
head of cattle about two months to reach the rio grande and the 
mountain pass it flows through that gives el paso its name the last 
weeks were spent trekking through the vast chihuahuan desert 
villagra wrote and the expedition ran out of water five days before 
reaching the river 
the horses suffered most poor dumb brutes they were almost 
frantic with thirst and their eyes nearly bulged from their 
sockets villagra wrote 12 years later 
on the morning of the fifth day without water the party spotted 
the river and villagra wrote that men and horses alike plunged in 
and drank their fill 
after 10 days of hunting fishing and recuperating villagra 
wrote we built a great bonfire and roasted the meat and fish and 
then all sat down to a repast the like of which we had never enjoyed 
before we were happy that our trials were over as happy as were 
the passengers in the ark when they saw the dove returning with the 
olive branch in his beak bringing tidings that the deluge had 
subsided 
the colonists feasted on geese ducks and fish 
dr wh timmons a historian at the university of texasel paso 
notes that villagras account does not mention a thanksgiving mass 
but you know they had to be thankful for surviving 
it must have been rough going for those gals and those kids 
timmons said and i think about those five days without water 
before striking the river and i can understand they were saying 
gracias a dios 
timmons said he believes onate reached the rio grande 15 to 25 
miles south of presentday downtown el paso 
the expedition stayed on the rivers south bank for about two 
weeks before continuing the journey finally settling near what is 
now santa fe during that time onate took formal possession of the 
lands draining into the rio grande 
hall and timmons say some people might reject their effort to 
credit onate for the first thanksgiving because his feast was held 
on the south bank of the rio grande and not in the presentday 
united states but timmons says the river later shifted its course 
southward in the area meaning the banquet did occur on us soil 
even if that werent the case organizers of the reenactment of 
the feast hope to bring more attention to the spanish explorers and 
colonists in the southwest 
all this happened before jamestown was established timmons 
said we had a european civilization before england planted its 
colonies on the eastern seaboard

the talk in parliament these days is drugs not so 
much the proposals for a new law but the smoking and the sniffing 
reportedly done by the members themselves 
this weeks issue of panorama a newsweekly ran a cover story 
titled honorable mr joint which surveyed members of the lower 
house and their drug habits especially whether they had ever smoked 
marijuana 
did i ever smoke joints and who didnt do it among my 
generation the article quoted a communist party deputy flora 
calvanese 34 as saying 
in politics cocaine also makes the rounds according to 
clemente mastella who serves as spokesman for the christian 
democrats italys dominant party he made clear he was talking 
about others not himself 
a furor began when the article appeared politicians were 
incensed not only over knowing who used drugs and who didnt but 
about those who talked 
i only answered the question a defensive mastella was quoted 
as saying in tuesdays la repubblica a leading national daily 
newspaper and i didnt believe that the drug issue would suddenly 
be transformed into a frivolous game into such gossip over the use 
and habits of parliamentarians 
italys preoccupation over its drug problem aggravated by 
alltime highs for overdose deaths and its link with aids already 
had put politicians in controversy 
claudio martelli the no 2 man in the rising socialist party of 
former premier bettino craxi was taken to task with his appeal to 
have no penalties for users of light drugs such as marijuana 
craxi had called for a law that would punish users as well as 
sellers of drugs 
one member of parliament who disapproved of drug use was 
hungarianborn porno movie star ilona staller known as 
cicciolina to her screen fans no no joints for me she was 
quoted as saying in panorama 
my drug is sex and i emerse myself in it if my colleagues did 
the same thing it would be one big beautiful thing she said 
her party the radicals proposed sarcastically that a drug 
rehabilitation center be opened in parliament

a 41 million outofcourt settlement 
between victims and contractors involved in the 1987 lambiance 
plaza building collapse will be signed next week now that the last 
roadblock has been removed officials said 
on monday federal safety officials said they would drop a record 
51 million in fines against five companies involved in 
constructing the apartment building in bridgeport 
us district judge robert zampano said monday that the us 
occupational safety and health administration agreed to accept a 
total of 430000 in fines which covers the cost of the federal 
investigation into the collapse of the partially completed building 
on april 23 1987 
twentyeight men died in the collapse and 16 others were injured 
zampano said that without the cooperation of osha officials a 
settlement would not have been possible 
last week zampano reported that the 41 million settlement had 
been reached among the dozens of lawyers victims builders and the 
city of bridgeport the agreement is scheduled to be signed dec 1 
terry mikelson an osha spokesman in washington said oshas 
purpose in issuing fines is to ensure better safety practices 
penalties are important but 430000 represents a penalty four 
times larger than the largest penalty ever paid to the agency during 
the 1970s he said and it is still a significant penalty in 
terms of the 80s 
zampano and state superior court judge frank s meadow spent 
months mediating discussions among lawyers for the plaintiffs and 
defendants in the 200 potential lawsuits that experts said they 
expected to result from the collapse 
it could have taken 10 to 15 years for all the suits to go 
through the court system experts said 
under the settlement the willful violations of safety 
standards for which osha cited the five companies will stand the 
companies have agreed to drop their appeals of the fines without 
admitting wrongdoing 
all five companies contested oshas original findings and fines 
the companies and the new osha fines are texstar construction 
corp of san antonio texas 300000 tpmimacomber a joint 
venture of tpm international of darien and bh macomber of boston 
100000 lift frame builders inc of elmsford ny 26900 
fairfield testing laboratories of stamford 3000 and preforce 
corp of new york city 100 
originally both texstar and tpmimacomber were fined 25 
million lift frame was fined 104000 fairfield testing

the government today announced it 
had joined cuba and angola in approving a southern africa peace plan 
that would lead to the pullout of an 50000 cuban troops from angola 
the agreement also clears the way to make southwest africa 
independent after 73 years of south african rule 
foreign minister pik botha said negotiations were continuing to 
establish a mutually acceptable system for verifying all phases of 
the cuban troop withdrawal which is expected to be conducted over a 
27month period 
that timetable would represent a compromise between a cuban 
proposal for a 30month pullout period and a south african call for 
a twoyear withdrawal us officials speaking anonymously have 
said the pullout probably will begin next month 
if this matter is resolved botha said the three countries would 
sign a formal agreement and the united nations would proceed to set 
a timetable for implementing its plan to hold independence elections 
in southwest africa also known as namibia 
the peace plan drafted by negotiators in geneva last week calls 
for a phased withdrawal of the cuban troops supporting angolas 
marxist government in a civil war the government is fighting rebels 
of the national union for the total independence of angola or 
unita which is backed by south africa and the united states 
cuba and angola announced acceptance of the proposal on friday 
south africa with backing from the united states has for years 
demanded the removal of the cuban troops as a condition for ending 
its rule over southwest africa which lies between angola and south 
africa 
botha said his government had told the united states that peace 
in the region will be impossible unless the 13yearold angolan war 
is resolved through negotiations the angolan government has refused 
to negotiate with unita on its demands for a share of power until 
free elections are held 
namibia which lies between angola and south africa long served 
as a base for south african army raids into southern angola to help 
support unita rebels 
the angolan rebels have been fighting to force the government in 
luanda to share power since shortly after angola gained independence 
from portugal in 1975 
cuban troops arrived in angola at that time to back government 
forces fighting the rebels 
south africa withdrew all its troops from angola to southwest 
africa in august as part of a ceasefire agreed on in an earlier 
round of talks the angolan rebels not a party to the talks does 
not recognize the ceasefire and reports of clashes between 
government and rebel forces continue 
at un headquarters in new york a un spokeswoman said 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar expressed his pleasure 
with the news 
the spokeswoman nadia younes said that perez de cuellar urged 
all parties to redouble efforts for a final settlement and allow a 
10yearold un resolution on independence for southwest africa to 
take effect 
un resolution 435 sets a oneyear timetable for the united 
nations to supervise elections for a constituent assembly in 
namibia which would draft a constitution and adopt an independent 
government 
un officials said the world body plans to send about 7500 
peacekeeping troops backed by about 2000 civilian personnel to 
supervise namibias transition to independence

marxist mozambique has decided for the 
first time to allow talks with rightwing rebels in a bid to bring 
peace to the former portuguese colony a church leader said tuesday 
the rev filipe sigue banze of the mozambique united methodist 
church told reporters that a mediation committee of church leaders 
has been set up with the blessing of the maputo government to 
contact the mozambique national resistance 
the resistance group also known by its portuguese acronym 
renamo has been blamed for widespread atrocities making hundreds 
of thousands of people homeless and forcing tens of thousands more 
into exile 
guerrillas who have been fighting for control of the southeast 
african territory for a decade control most of the countryside and 
make it dangerous for civilians to venture out of the capital 
maputo 
the government believes that since the churches represent many 
of the people it is for the churches to establish dialogue with the 
destabilizers of the region banze told a news conference 
there was no immediate comment from the mozambique government 
until now president joaquim chissanos government had refused to 
allow any dialogue with the rebels arguing they are terrorists on 
the payroll of neighboring south africa 
in recent talks with chissano south african president pw botha 
pledged that all support for the rebels had stopped 
banze said the peace and reconciliation committee was established 
by the 17member general christian council of mozambique under the 
leadership of anglican bishop denis sengulane 
committee members first met chissano in august and got specific 
instructions to seek direct talks with the rebels he said 
we the leaders of the church believe we can carry out that 
role banze said the first problem is finding the leaders who 
are scattered throughout mozambique he said 
banze said the committee hoped to report progress in peace 
efforts at a meeting with chissano next month 
we do not know what the atmosphere will be like the cleric 
said if it is favorable on the one side we will then speak to the 
other side we have to take it as it comes 
ultimately banze said the committee hoped to get the government 
and the guerrillas to talk to each other 
banze was among 150 church leaders and human rights activists at 
a fiveday world council of churches conference in harare on south 
african destabilization in the region 
the guerrrila group was created by the intelligence services of 
the rhodesian government in 1977 to harass black nationalist 
guerrillas who used mozambique as a launching pad for offensives 
into rhodesia 
the general christian council of mozambique does not include the 
roman catholic church the largest christian denomination in the 
country with about 2 million adherents out of the 15 million people 
half of mozambicans adhere to traditional animist beliefs and about 
10 percent are moslem

forty turkeys spared from the slaughterhouse 
by a truck accident are being offered for adoption by animal rights 
advocates who say about half already have been offered retirement 
homes in the country 
but 11 other birds that lived through the crash will play the 
traditional role on dinner tables thursday those birds apparently 
had been pledged before the adoption idea was proposed said pamela 
nielsen of the animalrights group creature comfort 
after fridays truck wreck which occurred on the way to a waco 
slaughterhouse the local humane society took 51 turkeys from the 
shipment to the skyline alcohol and drug treatment center east of 
austin 
the center had planned to feed its 60 residents and donate the 
remaining birds to the needy said kay tillman the centers 
assistant managerdirector were a nonprofit organization ms 
tillman said we were delighted to be offered 50 turkeys that 
wouldnt have just provided for thanksgiving it would have provided 
for christmas and all next year 
but ms nielsen and members of other animalrights groups gained 
a reprieve for the birds 
said ms tillman they seemed to feel as strongly about their 
cause as we do about ours were in the business of helping people 
theyre in the business of saving animals if anyone is that 
dedicated to anything you might as well help them 
ms nielsen said she hoped the public would donate food and other 
items to the treatment center to make up for the lost poultry 
people who have offered homes to the birds generally have farms 
with other animals ms nielsen said she said shes confident none 
of the turkeys will be eaten because the adopting parties were 
contacted through vegetarians and animalrights advocates 
they are just being nice enough to let them live out their 
lives said ms nielsen its a compassionate time of year 
ms nielsen said she plans an adoptabird program so interested 
people can donate food or money to help support the turkeys 
one person can really start the momentum going we saved 40 
birds lives she said

to buy a townhouse overlooking the mississippi river but the 
coops board of directors turned down the memphis native 
i tell you i was so hurt i couldnt believe this could 
happen particularly in my hometown ms shepherd said you tell 
yourself these things dont matter but it made me feel really bad 
ms shepherd said she got word of the boards action last week 
through henry turley jr who developed the townhouses and lives in 
the coop 
board members apparently were concerned that ms shepherd did not 
plan to spend much time in memphis and they worried about who she 
might allow to use the home she proposed to purchase 
but ms shepherd took the refusal personally as an insult to her 
character 
i think anywhere else in the world i could understand someone 
not knowing me or knowing the kind of person i am she said im

headed to california fitzwater said there has been some very 
strong opposition y fitzwater arefrom cabinet officials 
reagan earlier this month vetoed a whistleblower bill at the 
urging of attorney general richard thornburgh who complained that 
the legislation caused separationofpowers problems between the 
legislative and executive branches and would have made it virtually 
impossible for the government to fire anyone thornburgh also had 
said the bill would have put government agencies in the position of

the united states on tuesday said it will not 
hold talks with north korea and that the best way to ease tensions 
on the korean peninsula would be in direct talks between seoul and 
pyongyang 
state department spokesman charles redman said the united states 
had not received any communication from north korea asking for 
direct talks and was relying on news reports of pyongyangs views 
an article tuesday in the official north korean workers party 
newspaper said it is impossible to ease the tensions and remove 
the danger of war in korea and to create a peaceful condition for 
national reunification without holding north koreaus talks to 
solve the matter 
but redman said i dont believe theres any call for that at 
this stage 
the united states is encouraged that north and south korea are 
again dealing with each other on improving their ties and 
alleviating tenions and thats the proper place for this to 
occur 
last week legislators from the two koreas said they had made 
progress in efforts to plan fullscale parliamentary talks between 
the two sides 
redman noted that the united states had done its part by lifting 
some restrictions it imposed on the communist north for its alleged 
responsibility in the disappearance of a south korean passenger 
plane last november with 115 people on board 
at the behest of south korea the united states announced last 
month that it would allow some humanitarian exports to the north and 
informal contacts with official representatives from pyongyang 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
capitalist south at the end of world war ii in 1945 and the two 
sides have remained bitter enemies the united states maintains more 
than 40000 troops in the south 
redman criticized a recent spate of attacks by nationalists on 
us installations in south korea saying they were 
counterproductive and its also unnecessary there are adequate 
peacefull channels for dissent now in south korea under the 
democratic government of president roh taewoo 
we continue to believe that the vast majority of south koreans 
value the united states as a friend and an ally and want our 
security relationship to continue redman added

lyn nofzigers illegal lobbying convictions 
should be overturned because prosecutors didnt prove the former 
white house aide willfully violated the ethics law his lawyer told 
an appeals court tuesday 
the ethics in government act of 1978 only vaguely defines 
criminal intent and illegal lobbying contacts so that is it 
impossible for a person to know if he is violating the law attorney 
andrew l frey told a panel of the us circuit court of appeals 
here 
frey contended that the trial judge should have required 
independent counsel james c mckay to prove that nofziger knew the 
issues on which he was lobbying were of direct and substantial 
interest to the white house 
because there was no proof that nofziger had this specific 
knowledge he cant be held criminally liable for trying to interest 
the white house in issue that concerned his lobbying clients frey 
argued 
the concept of direct and substantial interest as espoused by 
the independent counsel and the court is so incapable of precise and 
predictable application as to make the statute unconstitutionally 
vague frey argued 
nofziger was convicted earlier this year of three felony counts 
of violating the oneyear ban on lobbying his former agency by 
contacting former white house colleagues within a year of resigning 
as president reagans political director in early 1982 
he received a 90day sentence and was fined 30000 by us 
district judge thomas a flannery who allowed nofziger to remain 
free while the case was appealed 
nofziger the first former high government official to be 
convicted under the law is being supported in his appeal by the 
american civil liberties union which filed a friendofthecourt 
brief 
he is challenging flannerys interpretation of the legal 
requirement for proving criminal intent under the law 
flannery ruled the prosecution need only prove that nofziger 
knowingly represented clients at the white house within the 
oneyear period in which his lobbying was restricted 
the judge held that proof that nofziger intended to influence the 
white house was also sufficient to convict the former presidential 
aide of two counts of illegally sending letters to former 
administration colleagues 
that element was not needed to prove criminal intent in a third 
count charging nofziger attended a white house meeting to urge 
continued funding of an antitank plane the judge ruled 
but the jury was not asked to find that mr nofziger had 
knowledge of the circumstances that made his contacts with the white 
house unlawful frey argued 
frey maintained because the statute is so confusing all we 
have to do to prevail here is persuade your honors that there is 
some ambiguity in the law 
richard friedman an associate independent counsel argued that 
the prosecution presented sufficient evidence that nofziger intended 
to exert influence when he wrote thenwhite house counselor edwin 
meese iii on behalf of wedtech corps bid for an army contract and 
meeses deputy james jenkins on behalf of a maritime engineers 
union 
friedman also argued that the statute clearly states the 
prosecutors only had to prove that nofziger knowingly acted on 
behalf of fairchild republic corp when he attended a sept 24 1982 
meeting with white house staff members on continued appropriations 
for the a10 antitank plane 
the intent of congress is stated with exceptional clarity in 
the conference report written before the law was enacted friedman 
said 
but two of the panel members circuit judges james l buckley and 
stephen williams appeared troubled by this argument 
buckley asked friedman to provide more evidence that congress 
intended a broad rather than a narrow definition of criminal intent 
but the prosecutor said he could cite nothing else 
friedman also argued that if there was any doubt in a former 
officials mind about whether a lobbying conduct was lawful he 
could seek a ruling from the office of government ethics 
would you recommend a client of yours to go forward on the 
basis of that recommendation buckley asked 
i would recommend my client stay clear i dont interpret the 
law to create a broad safe harbor of lobbying by former officials 
friedman said 
it sounds like by your standards that the only safe place to go 
is out of washington for a year said circuit judge harry edwards

several months and trying to formalize my own opinions about what 
happened he said ive been walking all over the place

formal anniversary ceremonies but said he thought he understood why 
they local officials worked 25 years to try to get the nation 
to forget it he said 
the dallas county democratic party which had been in charge of 
the official observance last marked the anniverary five years ago 
since then it has sponsored ceremonies each may in honor of

the kremlin has agreed to a single luncheon 
meeting dec 7 between soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and 
president reagan and presidentelect george bush in new york but 
the precise location remains uncertain a us official said tuesday 
two sites are under consideration the metropolitan museum of art 
and governors island in new york harbor reagan and french president 
francois mitterrand held a discussion of eastwest relations on the 
island during the celebration in july 1986 of the 100th anniversary 
of the statue of liberty 
governors island offers some security advantages american 
cuban south african and angolan diplomats met there last spring 
outside the glare of publicity to negotiate over the future of 
angola and namibia 
its a tossup right now said the us official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity except for the location the two sides have 
agreed on logistics he said 
gorbachev will meet with the retiring and incoming us presidents 
after addressing the un general assembly 
reagan and bush are projecting the meeting as not on the level of 
a summit they are expected to seek confirmation from the soviet 
president that in conducting superpower relations the leaders of the 
two countries will continue to stress arms control human rights and 
settling regional disputes 
gorbachev is expected to promote the idea of a human rights 
conference in moscow while the us side is looking for 
reaffirmation of soviet intentions to remove all remaining troops 
from afghanistan by feb 15 
the soviet leader will remain in new york after the meeting and 
do some sightseeing as well as see a group of american intellectuals 
at the soviet un mission the official said 
in contrast to the ornate metropolitan museum and its art 
treasures governors island is a modest coast guard base that was 
built up with dredge and rock excavated from new york subway 
construction 
it has been a sheep farm a quarantine station a game preserve 
and the site of a race track initially it was set aside for the 
english kings governors in 1698 and later for the governors of the 
american colonies it was converted into a military fortification in 
the war of 1812 and remained under the jurisdiction of the us army 
until 1966

president reagan phoned canadian 
prime minister brian mulroney today to congratulate mulroney on his 
partys victory in the canadian parliamentary elections 
in recent years relations between the united states and canada 
have been marked by cooperative dialogue and a remarkable record of 
mutually beneficial achievement reagan said in a statement 
released by the white house press office here 
reagan who is in the second day of a sixday thanksgiving 
vacation at his mountaintop ranch about 35 miles from this seaside 
city said the united states looks forward to working together 
with canada to further strengthen the ties of friendship and 
cooperation between canada and the united states 
in particular we look forward to the early implementation of 
the free trade agreement which we believe will be a positive 
factor in the economic future of both countries and on the uruguay 
round negotiations the president said in the statement 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters at a 
briefing that reagan had phoned mulroney at 1147 am est to 
extend his personal congratulations 
asked whether reagan had seen the victory of mulroneys 
progressive conservative party as a reaffirmation of the freetrade 
policies pursued by his administration fitzwater said we wouldnt 
try to term the reasons for mulroneys victory the canadian 
elections 
we are hopeful tht the free trade agreement will be implemented 
by the canadian parliament and then that the president will be 
able to take the next step which is to issue a diplomatic note to 
put the agreement into effect by january 1989 the spokesman 
said 
the agreement was sealed in this country by congressional 
approval earlier this year and it would commence a program of 
gradually removing all trade barriers and tariffs affecting the 
estimated 160 billion worth of trade between the two countries each 
year 
on capitol hill sen richard g lugar rind a former chairman 
of the senate foreign relations committee said it is impossible to 
overestimate the importance of the conservative victory and what it 
portends for world trade 
the uscanada trade agreement came at a time when many 
countries had to make a choice between either increasing world trade 
and overall world wealth or adopting protectionism and attempting to 
secure diminishing prospects thus increasing poverty in the midst 
of potential overall world economic decline lugar said 
it was vitally important that the election resolution make it 
possible for the treaty to be ratified by canada he said we 
know that free men everywhere rejoice with us

as the air force unveils its b2 stealth 
bomber with fanfare a federal inspection team is looking into 
health complaints of those who build the nations other 
radarevading plane the f117a stealth fighter 
the fighter which has been flying in secret since 1981 is made 
partly of fiberglasslike composite materials believed to be similar 
to some used in the b2 
some of the people who work with those materials say the 
chemicals are making them sick and the us occupational safety and 
health administration has had a team inspecting the topsecret 
stealth factory since sept 29 
the inspection which includes the classified skunk works 
section of the lockheed corp plant will continue for several 
weeks frank gravitt oshas regional administrator said tuesday 
he refused to reveal what had been found if anything 
lockheed says its plant is safe though it wont discuss the 
complaints in detail because of security restrictions imposed by its 
customer the air force 
the f117a is a different plane from the b2 made by different 
companies in different places osha hasnt any record of similar 
complaints at the northrop corp plant that makes the b2 in 
palmdale gravitt said 
despite the differences experts on the secret technology used to 
make radarevading planes say both the bomber and the fighter 
undoubtedly make extensive use of composites by this they mean 
lightweight plasticlike materials often made by using a flexible 
screen as a framework soaked in a gluelike liquid that hardens to 
give a part its shape 
the process is similar to that of making many boats though the 
materials vary 
in lawsuits against lockheed employees allege that chemicals 
whose names they dont know make them nauseous or dizzy they report 
ailments ranging from skin irritation to cancer and lawyers for the 
workers suggest the deaths of five workers from the skunk works may 
have been caused by the chemicals 
although almost everything about the stealth project often is 
treated as a deep mystery osha and presumably an air force team 
that also has visited the plant are looking for gardenvariety 
industrial safety problems lack of ventilation or protective gear 
for workers failure to establish safe manufacturing procedures 
insufficient training and safety monitoring of workers and sloppy 
practices by the workers themselves

george bush and carlos salinas de gortari the 
presidentselect of the united states and mexico arrived in texas 
today for quick getacquainted talks before taking the reins of 
government in their countries 
earlier bush told republican governors at a meeting in alabama 
that he will appoint special negotiators to deal with the federal 
budget deficit and he said to reporters traveling with him that he 
hasnt decided on a new defense secretary despite reports that he 
plans to appoint former sen john tower of texas 
in texas today bush arrived first at ellington air force base 
after the mexican leaders plane landed the vice president greeted 
him with a hearty handshake as he emerged 
salinas then joined bush in his limousine for the short trip to 
nasas johnson space center for two hours of talks 
earlier aboard his plane bush told reporters no decision has 
been made on a new defense secretary the tower story is not 
right he said 
bush said he hopes to finish naming toplevel members of his team 
within a month but expressed mild irritation about reading these 
stories about what i have decided he indicated the defense job 
would not be filled this week 
in washington kim garvin a tower spokeswoman said he at 
present has not been asked he is on hold 
the vice president spoke to reporters traveling with him aboard 
air force two to a republican governors conference in point clear 
ala 
at the meeting he told the governors he had not wavered in his 
resolve to avoid raising taxes as a way of trying to reduce the 
federal budget deficit 
however he said this problem of the federal deficit is 
pressing on the first day of my presidency i will name 
negotiators to represent the executive branch in deficit talks with 
the congress 
he told the 20 gop governors and two governorselect at the 
meeting that results of the election two weeks ago show that a 
majority of americans agree with our philosophy and he said 
we are on our way to becoming the majority party in america if we 
dont lose sight of what is driving our success 
though bush won the presidency the democrats gained one in the 
balance of governships one seat in the senate and three seats in 
the house in all of which they hold majorities 
before his trip to texas bush said his meeting with salinas 
manifests the importance that i place on mexicanus relations 
the leaders are expected to discuss the economy trade drug 
enforcement and possibly immigration at the private talks and 
luncheon at the johnson space center in houston according to sheila 
tate bushs spokeswoman 
bush also said he welcomed mondays election victory of canadian 
prime minister brian mulroney with whom he said he had a special 
kind of friendly personal relationship mulroney beat back a 
challenge from john turner leader of canadas liberal party 
mulroneys victory was most interesting because to a degree it 
was a referendum on getting the free trade agreement through bush 
said a key issue in the election was turners opposition to a 
canadianus agreement to eliminate trade barriers between the two 
countries 
as for towers status bush campaign sources speaking on 
condition they remain anonymous say the former head of the senate 
armed services committee is a likely selection for defense secretary 
new hampshire gov john sununu bushs choice for white house 
chief of staff predicted monday that bush would move next to fill 
the defense department post 
i think the next thing youll see probably after thanksgiving 
is the focus shift a little bit to the defense side a little 
rounding out of that team and then rounding out of some of the 
other major areas he said 
bush also said today he had not yet decided whom he will name as 
chairman of the white house council of economic advisers although 
there are reports he might select stanford university professor 
michael boskin 
bush called boskin a very good man he might well prove to be 
the economic adviser he added i havent sat down and talked to 
mike and i want to do that 
on monday bush named two more members of his cabinet reaching 
once again into the ranks of recent reagan appointees to keep dick 
thornburgh as attorney general and lauro f cavazos as education 
secretary they join treasury secretary nicholas f brady another 
holdover and james a baker iii the former treasury secretary and 
now bushs choice for secretary of state he also named richard g 
darman as director of the office of management and budget 
bush told reporters monday he would refrain from discussing new 
policy initiatives with salinas or with gorbachev when the soviet 
president visits the united nations next month and meets with both 
bush and reagan 
there will be no new program initiatives now said bush but 
he promised to make clear that i am committed to democracy in 
central america 
he said the sandinistas in nicaragua regrettably have not been 
willing to take the steps toward democracy that i find absolutely 
essential if we are going to have harmony in central america 
he said he would not make any commitments on arms control or 
anything else when he sees gorbachev it will be president 
reagans meeting i will be there as vice president of the united 
states and i expect theyll be aware theyre talking to the next 
president he said

the kremlins representative in a troubled southern 
region interrupted a session of the armenian legislature tuesday 
because of mass ethnic protests in neighboring azerbaijan official 
and dissident sources said 
arkady volsky interrupted the armenian supreme soviet and flew 
immediately to stepanakert the capital of the nagornokarabakh 
region which has been the focus of a dispute between the republics 
of azerbaijan and armenia said an editor of the official armenpress 
news agency 
reports from baku the capital of azerbaijan said a crowd of 
more than 100000 people carried banners saying free the heroes 
of sumgait 
the editor who spoke on condition of anonymity reported 
antiarmenian rallies in baku and several other azerbaijani cities 
ethnic rioting broke out in the azerbaijani city of sumgait at 
the end of february in which at least 32 people 26 armenians and 
six azerbaijanis were killed 
on saturday armenian activists in moscow reported that akhmed 
akhmedov an azerbaijani had been sentenced to death by a moscow 
court for leading a gang that killed seven people during the riots 
alexei mannonikov an editor with the dissident journal glasnost 
in moscow said large protests were reported in kirovabad and 
nakhichevan as well 
mannonikov said a strike at factories and public transportation 
was under way in baku and that demonstrators had marched to the 
armenian quarter of the city 
the armenpress editor said the supreme soviet of armenia had 
approved a proclamation officially recognizing a massacre of 
armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 be officially recognized by 
authorities as genocide 
armenian activists said that was important because it laid open 
for review a series of historical questions including territorial 
matters such as control over nagornokarabakh 
nagornokarabakh is a predominantly armenian area that was made a 
part of azerbaijan in the 1920s 
the residents began agitating in february for annexation by 
predominantly christian armenia leading to mass protests and 
strikes in armenia and counterprotests in azerbaijan which is 
mostly moslem 
mannonikov said the armenian parliament adjourned without 
discussing a proposal to approve amendments challenging moscows 
authority over the republics affairs similar to one approved in 
estonia last week 
the session was broadcast live on local tv it considered the 
republics 1989 budget first and then listened to complaints about 
the republics ecology situation from deputy khachik stambultsyan a 
member of the karabakh committee that is pushing for annexation 
said armenian activist rafael popoyan 
stambultsyan specifically complained about a nuclear power 
station built near yerevan the capital of armenia that officials 
since have acknowledged was constructed on a geological fault the 
drive to annex nagornokarabakh which began in february has 
spilled over to include complaints about too much control from 
moscow economic problems and the environment 
armenians gathered in the citys opera square where a television 
set was broadcasting the session and outside the supreme soviet 
building popoyan said 
moscow has turned down demands to unite nagornokarabakh with 
armenia opting instead for a longrange financial development plan 
the refusal has not quieted unrest however and another strike was 
reported in yerevan last week

a victorious prime minister brian mulroney today 
said canada had chosen the road to free trade with the united states 
and claimed a mandate to enact a controversial uscanada trade 
pact 
mulroney at a nationally televised news conference from his 
hometown of baiecomeau quebec said parliament will be called back 
into session next month to consider the pact and a whole series of 
bilateral problems 
mulroney fresh from the victory monday also said he had spoken 
to presidentelect george bush and was willing to meet with him 
before the us leaders inauguration 
the toronto star which had bitterly criticized the trade 
agreement said in an editorial that the people of canada have 
spoken convincingly 
with this historic mandate mulroney assumes an awesome 
responsibility canadians have put their future and that of their 
children in his hands 
voters returned mulroney to office with 170 seats in the 295seat 
house of commons 
he defeated two rivals who based their campaign on oppositiion to 
the trade pact mulroney signed with president reagan they claimed 
mulroneys free trade program would subordinate canada to the united 
states and ultimately rob canada of its sovereignty 
president reagan in santa barbara calif for thanksgiving 
vacation phoned mulroney today to congratulate him on the victory 
reagan said in a statement that the free trade agreement will be a 
positive factor in the economic future of both countries 
in point clear ala bush said he welcomed the mulroney victory 
with whom he said he had a special kind of friendly personal 
relationship 
mulroneys victory was most interesting because to a degree it 
was a referendum on getting the free trade agreement through bush 
told 20 republican governors and two governorselect at a meeting 
figures with 95 percent of the vote counted showed the opposition 
liberal party led by john turner with 82 seats more than double its 
40 of four years ago and the socialist new democratic party of ed 
broadbent with 43 seats up from 30 
the popular vote broke down to about 43 percent for the 
conservatives 32 percent for the liberals and 20 percent for the 
new democrats with the turnout at about 75 percent of the 175 
million eligible voters 
the canadian press news agency said the conservatives had 54 
million votes the liberals 405 million and the new democrats 24 
million 
the canadian dollar which had been jittery throughout the 
campaign as investors hesitated at a possible conservative defeat 
surged on international markets to trade at more than 83 cents 
the conservatives saw their power erode somewhat in the newly 
expanded 295seat house of commons they won 169 races on monday as 
compared to 211 out of 282 seats in the 1984 election 
businessmen in canada and overseas reacted favorably today to 
mulroneys return the first time a majority government has served 
two successive terms since 1953 
trevor taylor general manager of the bank of nova scotia in 
tokyo predicted a stronger canadian dollar by the end of the 
year 
canadians accepted the leap of faith that the 10year deal to 
eliminate all remaining trade barriers with their economically 
intimidating southern neighbor was good for the country 
turner and broadbent vehemently opposed the trade pact signed 
jan 2 saying canada would be beholden to america the pact passed 
by the us congress requires ratification by canadas parliament 
mulroney predicted his second term would bring not just more 
prosperity but more opportunity and security for all canadians 
canada is enjoying a sixyear economic boom 
a somber turner said in vancouver british colombia that he had 
fought with all my heart and with all my strength and ive got no 
regrets at all for waging the bitterly contested campaign called 
oct 1 by mulroney 
broadbent told a halfempty union hall in oshawa ontario it 
would not be accurate to say as leader of the party in this 
election this historic election that i am not somewhat 
disappointed 
after a jittery start in the four small maritime provinces of 
atlantic canada the conservatives swept quebec and did better than 
expected in ontario canadas largest province where opposition to 
the free trade pact was thought to be strongest 
they also did well across western canada especially in alberta 
where the important oil and gas industry was eager for the deal to 
proceed 
the liberals did better than expected in the atlantic provinces 
while the new democrats turned out best in british columbia 
mulroney has said he would call parliament back into session 
likely by dec 12 to proceed with the legislation needed for the 
agreement to take effect jan 1 as scheduled

a mugging victim who says she was saved from 
certain death when a neighbor shot her two assailants has asked 
a judge to be lenient when he sentences her rescuer for an earlier 
drug conviction 
i would like to see justice tempered with mercy for this 
unselfish act of compassion shown by this man a total stranger to 
me gertrude george wrote to state supreme court justice joseph 
slavin in a letter delivered monday 
the judge also was given 50 letters with similar messages from 
people who know the man clovis fearon and four petitions 
circulated in his brooklyn neighborhood 
slavin is to sentence fearon 29 on monday more than nine 
months after he pleaded guilty to felony charges for steering 
two undercover police officers to a drug dealer who sold them two 
vials of crack cocaine 
the judge had promised fearon a sentence of one day in jail and 
five years probation when he entered the plea in february 
but fearon never appeared for his march sentencing and 
authorities did not learn his whereabouts until nov 2 when he 
raced out of his apartment with an unlicensed revolver after hearing 
miss georges screams from the street 
he shot each of miss georges assailants once one raymond 
plowden 25 was found dead a block away still clutching her 
jewelry 
the other timothy lewis 25 escaped but was arrested on 
robbery assault and weapons charges at a hospital where he sought 
treatment for a gunshot wound to the back 
i was rescued from certain death by a man clovis fearon also 
known as anthony dixon who by coming to my defense revealed his own 
past for which he is being prosecuted said miss george who was 
attacked as she returned home from her job as a nurse 
after the shooting fearon told police his name was anthony 
dixon but his true identity was discovered through fingerprints 
taken when he was charged with illegal possession of a weapon the 
unlicensed gun he used in the shooting 
fearon was ordered jailed by slavin until his sentencing for the 
drug conviction 
during his time as a fugitive fearon was a lawabiding citizen 
who held as many as three jobs at once said his attorney paul 
ascher 
two of the petitions to the court signed by about 300 
neighborhood residents urged slavin to give fearon only probation 
ascher said a third petition was signed by area businessmen and 
merchants and the fourth by about 20 people who work at the 
hospital where lewis was arrested

the consumer product safety commission on 
tuesday defended its record on ridding the market of dangerous toys 
but urged parents to consider safety when shopping for their 
children this holiday season 
while federal authorities have stepped up efforts to intercept 
dangerous imported toys at the nations ports parents must still 
practice safety anne graham commissioner of the safety 
commission told reporters at the federal agencys annual holiday 
safety news conference 
the commission said its joint effort with the us customs 
service which was begun in 1987 has resulted in the seizure of 
891000 toys that failed to meet federal safety guidelines between 
oct 1 1987 and sept 30 1988 and 162668 toys since oct 1 of 
this year 
but commission officials urged parents to heed the age 
recommendations and warning labels on toys consider their childs 
skill level and be aware of the play environment 
standing before a display of toys that had been recalled in 1988 
ms graham also responded to charges from the consumer affairs 
committee of the americans for democratic action which on monday 
claimed that the major reason for the abundance of dangerous 
toys is the pitiful ineptitude of the cpsc 
i clearly dont agree with their allegations we spend 12 
months out of every year trying to address toy safety ms graham 
said 
on the other hand im appreciative of the ada for bringing the 
toys that theyre concerned about to our attention our compliance 
unit will be looking at them immediately and determining if theyre 
safe or not if theyre not well take measures to get them off the 
market she said 
toys caused 131000 injuries last year including 105000 to 
children under age 15 according to the safety commission 
two types of toys to avoid the ada said in its report monday 
are baby walkers and crib gyms the walkers can tip over or fall 
down stairs while the gyms are responsible for a dozen deaths and 
662 other injuries in the past five years the report said 
accidents involving baby walkers occur when steps or stairways 
are not blocked or doors are not closed john preston a mechanical 
engineer with the commission said at the news conference he 
encouraged close parental supervision 
as far as baby walkers are concerned there arent any specific 
defects ms graham said 
commission spokeswoman elaine tyrrell demonstrated how a crib gym 
could become dangerous for a child who is able to stand usually 
about the age of six months 
a child could get entangled in the toy which stretches across a 
crib and strangulation deaths have occured she urged parents to 
remove the toy once a child becomes more active 
the commission said two pamphlets titled which toy for which 
child a consumers guide for selecting suitable toys are 
available to those seeking guidance on what toys to buy 
one pamphlet is for ages birth through 5 the other is for ages 6 
through 12 
they describe the types of activities children enjoy at specific 
ages and the toys they prefer they suggest types of toys without 
providing trade names for active play manipulative play 
makebelieve play creative play and learning play 
another pamphlet titled for kids sake recommends that 
parents 
keep in mind the childs age interests and skill level look 
for quality design and construction in all toys for all ages 
be a label reader look for and heed age recommendations and 
other safety labels 
keep toys for older children away from younger children 
the pamphlets are available by writing the us consumer product

former defense secretary caspar weinberger says 
glasnost is mostly a public relations stunt and that the soviets 
are still intent on ruling the world 
i have not yet seen any indication that they have given up 
their idea of world domination weinberger said in an interview 
published tuesday by janes defense weekly 
i think a very great deal of glasnost is a public relations 
exercise on a very large scale and a recognition that the attempts 
to change western public opinion in the past failed despite their 
absolute confidence they could do that with peace marches and so 
on he said of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
greater openness on selected social topics 
gorbachev has tried to convince the west that he is a different 
sort of person that he is a western type of man that he likes 
freedom and democracy and that he would like the soviet union to be 
more like the west 
it is very dangerous if we believe that 
weinberger was quoted as saying the soviet military has not 
been cut back by one ruble and still keeps growing 
on the soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan weinberger told 
janes they have started to withdraw in a very peculiar way by 
putting in more scud missiles and more troops so i worry very much 
if they are going to carry out their withdrawal

israeli warplanes blasted guerrilla bases 
killing six people and wounding nine on tuesday the 45th 
anniversary of lebanons independence 
christians and moslems marched in separate parades in beirut 
marking independence underscoring fractured lebanons partition 
into sectarian ministates 
as they celebrated bursts of gunfire and grenade blasts 
resounded across the capital when the syrianbacked shiite militia 
amal and the rival proiranian hezbollah or party of god clashed 
in gunbattles in south beirut slums 
the israeli raid on the biggest refugee camp in lebanon killed 
six palestinians including a 4yearold girl and wounded nine it 
was the first air assault since the declaration of an independent 
state of palestine a week ago 
police said four israeli fighterbombers thundered in on 
palestine liberation organization targets on the outskirts of 
lebanons southern port of sidon they staged four rocket runs in 
five minutes on a plo checkpoint at ein elhilweh refugee camp 
police said the camp of 60000 palestinians is the largest of the 
11 in lebanon 
two helicopter gunships followed 10 minutes later police said 
they hit two jeeps racing to help wounded guerrillas at the burning 
checkpoint 
the bodies of three guerrillas from george habashs marxist 
popular front for the liberation of palestine were retrieved from 
one jeep the other vehicle belonged to plo chairman yasser arafats 
mainstream fatah police said 
a fatah gunner was killed when a rocket slammed into a nearby 
artillery base where a woman and her 4yearold daughter also died 
rescuers were searching rubble for more victims 
guerrillas unleashed a screen of sam7 strella missiles at the 
helicopters but made no hits police said 
a israeli command communique said its warplanes struck targets 
serving as guerrilla headquarters and launching points for attacks 
against israel 
it was israels 22nd air raid in lebanon this year by police 
count 108 people have been killed and 309 wounded in 21 air strikes 
since jan 3 
syrian troops in beiruts moslem sector sent loudspeaker vans 
blaring calls for an immediate ceasefire into the embattled slums 
of chiyah and ghobeiri there was no quick report of casualties 
we have not been able to take stock of the losses yet said an 
amal spokesman 
the fighting erupted a day after four senior leaders of the 
fundamentalist hezbollah escaped assassination by a 
remotecontrolled car bomb 
the two factions are vying for dominance of the 1 million shiites 
who form lebanons biggest sect 
in beirut moslem and christian units of lebanons 42000member 
army staged separate parades to mark independence from france in 
1943 
acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni and the rival head of 
the christian cabinet gen michel aoun delivered separate speeches 
the split celebrations reflected the ongoing political crisis 
that has left lebanon without a president for two months 
threatening to formalize the de facto partition after 13 years of 
civil war 
lebanon is in the throes of collapse said syrianbacked 
hoss we cannot recover our unity through further dismemberment 
if reunion is difficult partition is impossible 
aoun lashed out at syria and israel as occupiers and usurpers 
an estimated 40000 syrian troops are stationed on 70 percent of 
lebanons territory under a 1976 arab league mandate to end the 
civil war israel controls a 6to10 mile enclave in south lebanon 
as a buffer zone against crossborder guerrilla raids

a 70yearold man said tuesday he was 
within his rights when he sprayed tear gas on a group of threatening 
youngsters and said he will appeal a judges order to pay a 100 
fine 
these kids came at me with violence and said they had knives 
and said they were going to carve out my liver and fry it said 
edward white of cedar rapids 
associate district judge michael newmeister found white guilty of 
assault a misdemeanor and fined him the maximum 100 on monday a 
county prosecutor said an effort would be made to require white to 
pay the youths hospital bills 
several of the youths said in court that one boy who couldnt be 
located for trial had threatened to kill white and that he had a 
knife however the youths had varied recollections about whether 
the threat came before or after white sprayed the group with tear 
gas 
seven children aged 8 to 14 were taken to a hospital for 
treatment of irritated eyes and skin after being sprayed in the 
sept 18 incident 
i was only protecting myself and now they say i have to pay 
hospital costs white said in a telephone interview from his home 
things have quieted down since i put the tear gas on em there 
hasnt been any problem next door since then i guess i settled it 
white said he and other neighbors had trouble with neighborhood 
children for some time before the incident 
on the night in question white and his 94yearold mother were 
sitting on their porch a group of teenagers was in the area and 
white said they flew into a rage when he asked them to stop making 
so much noise 
the officer said i should have called police but i know that 
wouldnt have done any good white said 
white said he displayed his tear gas canister and warned the 
teenagers what he would do if they didnt disperse

prime minister yitzhak shamir renewed the task 
of tying together rightwing and ultraorthodox religious parties in 
a government after talks broke off tuesday with the leftleaning 
labor party 
shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir said the premier was confident 
he could form a majority government in parliament by next week 
other officials including some in shamirs rightwing likud 
bloc admitted the prime minister faces a complicated chore and 
might have to turn again to labor headed by his archrival foreign 
minister shimon peres 
labor halted the talks after being refused two key cabinet posts 
equal representation in the decisionmaking inner cabinet and 
assurances israel will press for a middle east peace labor party 
officials said 
without labor shamir must please seven small parties and faces 
lobbying by american and canadian jews objecting to orthodox dhe current 
breakoff was partly a bargaining 
tactic 
shamir is faced with having to form a coaltion government because 
nov 1 elections to the 120seat knesset or parliament gave his 
likud only 40 seats and labor 39 the rest went to leftist rightist 
and religious parties 
in his efforts to attract religious parties shamir is becoming 
entangled in an argument between orthodox jews and the reform and 
conservative branches of judaism which are dominant overseas 
a dozen american and canadian jewish leaders are lobbying shamir 
to reject orthodox demands for the who is a jew law that would 
mean conversions to judaism would be accepted in israel only if they 
were done by orthodox rabbis 
the foreign jewish leaders who represent the reform and 
conservative movements say the new law calls into question their 
jewishness 
ahimeir said shamir told us and canadian jews on tuesday he 
would stick to the promise to put the law before the knesset despite 
opposition by north american jews 
he explained to them that the matter was a formal internal 
israeli matter that should not create a rift or misunderstanding 
with diaspora jewry ahimeir said in a telephone interview 
the four religious parties submitted the bill to the knesset 
tuesday but some likud members said shamir will find it tough to 
get the legislation approved 
meir shitreet a likud lawmaker told israel television the law 
could cost israel up to 100 million in annual contributions from 
us jews

lawmakers in soviet latvia met today to consider 
declaring more selfrule for their republic from moscow as 
neighboring estonia did last week in a vote that provoked kremlin 
opposition 
latvias supreme soviet convened in the capital riga to adopt a 
1989 budget it was expected this evening to consider constitutional 
reforms proposed by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
mikhail bonden who is affiliated with the moscowbased human 
rights journal expresskhronika said by telephone from riga that 50 
pickets stood outside the supreme soviet carrying signs opposing the 
constitutional changes many latvians claim they would reduce the 
rights of their republic 
deputies from a special legal commission of the supreme soviet 
national parliament have recommended some changes in amendments 
proposed by gorbachev to limit the powers of a new national council 
which originally would have been able to strike down laws adopted by 
legislatures of the 15 soviet republics 
andrei tsirulis a latvian youth newspaper editor said leaders 
of a local grassroots political organization the peoples front 
asked their deputies to take legal steps so the republic will have 
sovereignty inside the soviet union 
last wednesday estonias parliament declared itself 
sovereign saying it had the right to override all federal 
legislation with the exception of that pertaining to foreign policy 
and defense 
the supreme soviet in the third baltic republic lithuania 
balked at taking a similar step friday 
latvias legislature whose session was being broadcast live on 
two local radio stations was to vote on the constitutional changes 
after considering local economic issues tsirulis said 
the entire latvian people is listening attentively the 
editor said the latvian people support the proposals of the 
peoples front and want them adopted 
the legal commission of the moscowbased supreme soviet which 
met saturday said the estonian decision to make soviet laws 
subordinate to local control violates the 1977 soviet constitution 
they forwarded their decision to the supreme soviet presidium 
the nations top executive body possibly presaging a striking down 
of the estonian action 
estonia latvia and lithuania were independent after the 1917 
bolshevik revolution until 1940 when they were absorbed by the 
soviets under a 1939 agreement with nazi germany 
in the southern soviet republic of armenia today the kremlins 
representative to the region today interrupted an armenian 
legislative session because of ethnic protests in neighboring 
azerbaijan official and dissident sources said 
arkady volsky sent by the kremlin to oversee its policy in the 
area broke up the armenian supreme soviet and then flew immediately 
to stepanakert the capital of the nagornokarabakh region which is 
disputed by azerbaijan and armenia said an editor of the official 
armenpress news agency 
volsky and armenian officials presumably felt that debate of 
several issues pertaining to nagornokarabakh on the agenda of the 
armenians parliament could increase tensions further 
the editor who spoke on condition of anonymity reported 
antiarmenian rallies in the azerbaijani capital of baku and 
several other azerbaijani cities 
reports from baku said a crowd of more than 100000 people 
carried banners saying free the heroes of sumgait 
strikes and demonstrations about the demands sparked rioting in 
which at least 32 people were killed in the azerbaijani city of 
sumgait at the end of february and beginning of march 
the mainly christian armenians claim nagornokarabakh is 
historically part of armenia but was attached to azerbaijan which 
is moslem dominated in the 1920s 
moscow has turned down demands to unite nagornokarabakh with 
armenia opting instead for a longrange financial development plan

sharp increases for fall and winter clothing 
put consumer price inflation back in the 5 percent annual range last 
month despite the smallest monthly increase in food costs since 
february the government said tuesday 
consumer prices rose 04 percent in october or at an annual 
rate of 51 percent with more than half of the gain coming from a 
18 percent boost in apparel prices and sharp increases in auto 
insurance and financing charges the labor department said 
inflation had slowed to an annual rate of 41 percent in 
september as a 17 percent drop in gasoline prices offset 
droughtcaused spikes in grocery prices overall cost increases were 
held to just 03 percent for that month 
economists also had anticipated smaller price increases in 
october believing that merchants would not mark up their fall and 
winter clothing lines as much after already boosting them by 2 
percent in september 
its still fundamentally in line with an inflation rate of 45 
percent to 5 percent that weve seen over the past year or so 
larry chimerine chairman of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa 
forecasting firm said of the overall october numbers 
chimerines view represents the center in a range of opinions 
among analysts some say the us economy is on the verge of an 
inflationary spiral of wage and price increases others believe it 
is nowhere near that danger point 
inflation has creeped up from last years rate of 44 percent it 
rose from an annual rate of 42 percent in the first quarter of 1988 
to 45 percent in the second quarter and to 48 percent in the third 
quarter 
but the white house predicted tuesday that inflation will slow 
dramatically in november and december to finish the year with only a 
43 percent increase over 1987 compared with a 46 percent annual 
rate for the first 10 months 
for 1989 the administration is forecasting consumer price 
inflation of only 37 percent compared with predictions of 5 
percent or more by private analysts 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co a new york 
consulting firm said the nation has an unacceptable inflation 
problem even if policymakers do not recognize it yet 
five percent inflation may be alright for some segments of the 
economy but it induces a greater inflation psychology where it 
doesnt take much to push it up to 55 or 6 percent he said 
any shock higher oil prices a falling dollar another drought 
higher wages can run it up more 
weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation rose a seasonally 
adjusted 05 percent in october the same increase as september the 
labor department said 
but in august they had fallen 13 percent the worst drop in 
four years and even though the 32981 average weekly pay check 
last month was 41 percent higher than in october 1987 workers 
still had slightly less buying power than they did a year ago the 
department said 
price figures for the month showed that the first round of 
aftershocks from the 1987 drought the driest summer in decades for 
the country are about over 
food costs rose only 02 percent compared with a 08 percent 
jump in september and fruit and vegetable prices fell 11 percent 
after rising 129 percent the preceding three months because of 
droughtrelated shortages 
prices for beef pork and poultry also fell in october by 03 
percent 08 percent and 30 percent respectively offsetting the 
declines was the biggest monthly price increase for dairy products 
since december 1980 09 percent 
cereal and bakery product costs rose 07 percent roughly the 
trend of monthly increases they have followed all year and stemming 
largely from a droughtinduced erosion of grain stockpiles stored 
from past surpluses 
gasoline prices fell 1 percent in october after the 17 percent 
drop in september and home heating oil costs were down 32 percent 
but a 14 percent increase in home electric and natural gas rates 
eroded the overall energy savings 
while crude oil prices have plummeted by more than 30 percent 
over the past year gasoline prices over the same period have 
dropped less than 2 percent and home heating prices have fallen only 
5 percent 
excluding food and energy prices rose 05 percent for the month 
the 18 percent apparel cost gains in october atop the 2 percent 
increase in september reflected the introduction of higherpriced 
fall and winter fashions particularly for womens and girls 
clothing and shoes 
those prices are going to give pretty quickly if the past few 
years are any precedent said sandra shaber an analyst for the 
futures group a washington economic consulting firm 
ms shaber said retailers have changed their pricing policies in 
recent years marking up prices more upon the introduction of new 
lines and models to make the discounts later look that much 
better 
sticker prices on new 1989 model autos for example are 75 
percent over comparable 1988 models the labor department said but 
seasonally adjusted new car prices in october were just 02 percent 
higher than in september even though 89 models accounted for 
onefourth of the new cars sold in the governments october survey 
and none in the september tally 
meanwhile auto insurance and finance charges rose 14 percent 
and 34 percent respectively last month 
medical care costs rose 05 percent halfway between the 
respective 04 percent and 06 percent increases in august and 
september in the last year medical costs have risen a total of 67 
percent 
the october increases raised the consumer price index to 1202 
that means a basket of goods costing 100 on average from 1982 
through 1984 would have cost 12020 last month 40 cents higher 
than in september and up from 11530 a year ago

federal whale biologists may turn to 
california tour boat operatiors to learn the fate of two gray whales 
that were rescued from the arctic ice near barrow 
jim harvey a whale expert at the national marine mammal 
laboratory in seattle said tuesday that biologists are discussing 
whether to distribute pictures of the whales to tour boat operators 
in the hope someone may spot them 
the primary benefit of such an effort would be to satisfy public 
interest in the fate of the whales that were trapped for nearly 
three weeks according to harvey 
but he added knowing whether the whales survived may also help 
officials make future decisions about whether similar rescue efforts 
should be undertaken and whether techniques developed during the 
milliondollar rescue effort in barrow last month were effective he 
said 
even if the pictures were widely distributed the chances of 
anyone ever spotting the whales are slim said harvey 
the pictures taken in barrow consist only of the whales heads 
in the whales typical surfacing pattern in open water only their 
backs and tail flukes are visible 
they would just about have to swim up to a boat and stick their 
heads out of the water to be identified harvey said 
there is also the possibility that the whales may never go as far 
south as california where a tour boat industry thrives on taking 
people out among the whales 
ron morris a national marine fisheries service biologist who 
coordinated the barrow rescue effort said some gray whales stop in 
the vicinity of vancouver bc and san francisco rather than 
going all the way to the breeding grounds off baja calif 
these could stop too since theyre not breeding adults he 
said 
assuming the whales made it through more than 200 miles of 
icechoked water between barrow and the southern edge of the ice 
pack off alaskas coast the whales still have a long way to go 
before tour boats have any chance of catching a glimpse of them 
based on an average migration speed of 3 miles per hour morris 
estimated the whales are still somewhere in the gulf of alaska 
in los angeles the cabrillo marine museum already is training 
100 volunteers to be on the lookout when the whalewatching season 
begins dec 26 in southern california the volunteers will be 
assigned to various boats passing out pictures of the whales and 
describing their unique characteristics 
its added excitement said larry fukuhara the museums 
whale program coordinator well be copying the photos and giving 
lectures and hopefully we can spot them 
however fukuhara said whale watchers have been trying since the 
early 1970s to spot chichi a captured whale that spent a year in 
captivity at sea world in san diego before being released into the 
ocean chichi was also marked and branded but no one has spotted 
her since he said

accusing some radical palestinian groups of 
coldblooded terror a top state department official on tuesday 
dismissed as nonsense any suggestion that the palestine national 
council had renounced terrorism 
it is simply incorrect to assert that by its recent declaration 
the plo renounced terrorism l paul bremer iii who heads the 
departments counterterrorism office said 
in a speech at a george washington university conference bremer 
also reported that terrorist attacks on us targets were running 31 
percent above 1987 levels 
and 1987 he said was the bloodiest year for terrorist incidents 
since the state department began compiling statistics in 1968 we 
cannot expect completely to eradicate terrorism but we can aim to 
reduce significantly terrorisms status on the international 
agenda 
the palestine national council the quasilegislative arm of the 
palestine liberation organization meeting last tuesday in algiers 
declared the establishment of an independent palestinian state 
without defining its boundaries 
the council also adopted a declaration that the european 
community among others subsequently concluded was a renunciation 
of terrorism 
but bremer said the council specifically endorsed the 1985 cairo 
declaration in which the plo while condemning terrorism also 
affirmed its adherence to the palestinian peoples right to resist 
the israeli occupation of their land in any way possible 
also bremer said the plo group endorsed a highly 
objectionable resolution by the un security council that used 
all the codewords terrorists use to justify their acts 
for instance the state department official said the resolution 
reiterates the inalienable right to selfdetermination and 
upholds the legitimacy of their struggle in particular the 
struggle of national liberation movements 
so bremer said while some people some press reports and even 
some governments have concluded that in its declaration the pnc 
denounced terrorism this is nonsense 
the state department official said the first immediate concern of 
us counterterrorism experts was the likely increase in radical 
palestinian terrorism 
in may he said terrorists from the abu nidal organization used 
machine guns and grenades to attack a sudanese hotel and club 
frequented by foreign visitors and in july attacked a greek 
passenger ship 
last month bremer said west german police arrested members of 
the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command 
before they could carry out a terrorist attack 
otrher violent and fanatical palestinian groups recently 
proclaimed their intention to step up their terrorism against 
israel he said 
combining a deep visceral hostility to the west with 
coldblooded terror bremer said these radical palestinian 
groups receive financial logistical and weapons support from syria 
and libya they are responsible for some of the most vicious 
terrorist operations on record

the air force rolled out its mysterious 
b2 stealth bomber today taking the cloak of secrecy off a sleek 
flying wing designed to evade enemy radar while carrying nuclear 
weapons 
a band played the stealth fanfare and a crowd of guests 
cheered as a decade of secrecy ended about the hightechnology 
aircraft the crown jewel of the pentagons black inventory of 
supersecret devices 
the boomerangshaped plane built by northrop corp has a cockpit 
flanked by two engine intakes positioned atop its single continuous 
wing it is light gray on top and black underneath 
spectators were kept at a secure distance of 200 feet and were 
unable from their vantage point to see the rear of the aircraft the 
plane rolled slowly out of a hangar at air force plant 42 had 
previously been shown only as a rough drawing 
let all of us remember americas enduring hope and prayer that 
the b2 will strengthen the cause of peace and that this magnificent 
aircraft will never be flown in anger said air force secretary 
edward c pete aldridge jr 
on monday in one of the aerospace companys first public 
pronouncements about the b2 northrop spokesman les daly said that 
the stealth is simply not comparable to anything ever done before 
it is the first real computerage aircraft 
the aircraft has not yet flown and the general accounting office 
estimates it could cost taxpayers up to 685 billion if the 
pentagon builds the 132 aircraftfleet sought by the air force 
the b1b the air forces most current operational nuclear 
bomber came in around 250 million apiece before modifications 
stealth bombers could cost twice that 
critics have questioned the need for such a plane and called it a 
destabilizing element in armscontrol efforts gen larry d welch 
air force chief of staff contends the b2 will play a vital role in 
americas defense 
the stealth socalled because it is intended to be extremely 
difficult to detect on enemy radar has been described as a dark 
tailless flying wing with no sharp angles to reflect radar and 
built of exotic composite materials some of which will absorb radar 
rather than reflect it air force officials say it will resemble a 
bird on a radar screen 
until earlier this year northrop was forbidden even to 
acknowledge it was developing the bomber 
the only previous public view of the b2 was a drawing released 
in april showing what looked like two wings bolted together with no 
fuselage or tail sources said some details about the planes design 
were deliberately disguised 
the public may have seen what it thought was the b2 in recent tv 
commercials by american honda a mockup of the bomber sitting on an 
airfield with an angry red background looms over a small and sleek 
black honda crx the lifesize mockup was built for an ad agency 
based on the air force drawing 
the planes real public debut at air force plant 42 didnt reveal 
much more detail reporters and photographers had been told in 
advance that they wouldnt be allowed closer than 200 feet and the 
plane was never turned so that anything but the front could be seen 
todays ceremony for congressional representatives news media 
and aerospace industry insiders followed by three weeks the 
pentagons release of a photo of another closely held project 
lockheed corps stealth fighter the f117a 
for years the stealth aircraft have been carried as black 
programs with the pentagon refusing even to acknowledge their 
existence 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo said recently that the air 
force was attempting to manipulate the publics fascination with 
technology to build good will for new military spending 
we dont know whats right with stealth we dont know whats 
wrong with stealth she said 
the union of concerned scientists a private organization has 
issued a report challenging the need for such an expensive weapons 
system saying that it could destabilize arms control because some 
of its missions would include destruction of such targets as command 
centers and mobile missile sites 
however support for the bomber in military spending committees 
on capitol hill has been bipartisan said the air force chief of 
staff 
the air force said the plane is 69 feet long about the length of 
an f16 fighter plane its wingspan at 172 feet is almost as wide 
as the aging b52 
even though it has never left the runway it is one of the most 
carefully tested aircraft ever built because of advanced 
manufacturing techniques and computer simulations that evaluated how 
the aircraft would perform northrop said 
we know more about this airplane before it flew than any other 
airplane daly said it is a remarkable aircraft 
flight tests will begin probably early next year at edwards air 
force base about 70 miles north of los angeles in the mojave 
desert the air force said

president reagan on tuesday 
congratulated canadian prime minister brian mulroney on his election 
victory saying he thought it would further strengthen the ties of 
friendship between their nations 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan who is 
vacationing at his nearby mountaintop ranch had telephoned mulroney 
to personally congratulate him on him on the victory of his 
progressive conservative party over the liberal and new democratic 
parties 
the president said in a statement that relations between the 
united states and canada have been marked by cooperative dialogue 
and a remarkable record of mutually beneficial achievement in 
recent years 
reagan and mulroney had got along well personally as well and 
the two men often kidded one another about their irish ancestry 
the president said he considered mulroneys winning 170 of the 
295 seats in the house of commons as a goahead signal on the 
uscanada free trade agreement which has been approved by congress 
but must still be accepted by the canadian parliament 
the agreement is aimed at phasing out all barriers and tariffs on 
trade between the two north american neighbors which do about 160 
billion worth of business with each other annually 
reagans statement said we look forward to the early 
implementation of the free trade agreement which we believe will 
be a positive factor in the economic future of both countries and on 
the uruguay round negotiations 
the latter reference was to the bargaining that the united 
states canada and some 95 other nations are undertaking under the 
auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade to open new 
markets and remove trade barriers a midterm review of the gatt 
negotiations is scheduled to begin in montreal on dec 5 
speaking to republican governors meeting in point clear ala 
presidentelect george bush called mulroneys victory an endorsement 
of the free trade pact by the canadian public that indeed was a 
referendum on whether were going to have more markets and freer 
trade both ways he said 
bush also telephoned his congratulations to mulroney 
at a news briefing fitzwater was asked to say to what extent 
reagan considered mulroneys victory a vindication of the 
presidents strong support for the free trade agreement 
we wouldnt try to interpret the canadian elections beyond the 
obvious that it was an election between two parties and presumably 
general support for prime minister mulroneys policies the 
spokesman replied 
we are hopeful that the free trade agreement will be 
implemented by the parliament and that the president will then be 
able to take the next step which is to issue a diplomatic note that 
then puts the two agreements into effect by january of 1989 
mulroney has promised to call the house of commons into session 
as soon as possible to ratify the agreement 
us trade representative clayton yeutter also expressed pleasure 
at the outcome saying in a statement in washington that with 
expected canadian approval of the pact we will now have the 
largest economic trading partnership in the entire world making 
both us and canadian firms more competitive with our other foreign 
trading partners 
the free trade agreement will bring prosperity to both 
countries for years to come yeutter said 
on capitol hill sens john heinz rpa and bill bradley 
dnj also said the victory of mulroneys party would strengthen 
the relationship between the united states and canada and lend 
momentum to opening markets around the world

the government tuesday announced it 
had joined cuba and angola in approving a usmediated plan to 
remove 50000 cuban troops from angola and set the stage for the 
independence of southwest africa 
the hard nut that had to be cracked has been cracked said 
foreign minister pik botha whose government for years has linked 
the independence of southwest africa also known as namibia to a 
cuban withdrawal 
botha said negotiations were taking place in new york to 
establish a mutually acceptable system for verifying all phases of 
the withdrawal which is expected to be conducted over a 27month 
period 
if this matter is resolved botha said the three countries would 
sign a formal agreement and the united nations would proceed to set 
a timetable for implementing its plan to hold independence elections 
in namibia 
he declined to predict when these steps might occur 
in washington the state department said it was pleased by the 
south african announcement 
with this step all three governments have signaled their 
acceptance of the geneva understandings said spokesman charles 
redman 
he said the way is clear to complete the negotiations and sign 
the agreements the parties have said they will conclude 
implementation of a un security council resolution governing 
the indpendence process in namibia is expected to begin six to eight 
weeks after actual signature of the agreements he said 
the parties also must work out final details of the un role in 
the region and of verification of cuban troop withdrawal from 
angola redman said 
at un headquarters in new york secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar also expressed pleasure at south africas announcement 
and urged all the parties to redouble their efforts to arrange a 
final settlement 
the un security councils resolution 435 adopted 10 years ago 
outlines a oneyear transition period during which elections would 
be held for an assembly to draft a constitution for an independent 
namibian government the un would send about 7500 peacekeeping 
troops to namibia backed by about 2000 civilian personnel 
botha said he mistrusted the united nations collectively but had 
faith in perez de cuellar who ensured south african officials 
during a recent visit here that the elections would be overseen 
impartially 
the troop withdrawal plan was drafted by negotiators in geneva 
last week cuba and angola announced their acceptance on friday 
cuban troops have been supporting angolas marxist government 
since 1975 in a civil war against south african and ussupported 
rebels of unita the national union for the total independence of 
angola 
south africa with backing from the united states has for years 
demanded the removal of the cuban troops as a precondition for 
ending its rule over namibia which lies between angola and south 
africa 
botha said his government has told the united states that peace 
in the region will be impossible unless the angolan war is resolved 
through negotiations thus far the angolan government has refused 
to negotiate with unita on its demands for a share of power until 
free elections are held 
foreign minister botha and president pw botha who are not 
related met tuesday in pretoria with unita leader jonas savimbi 
presumably to discuss whether south african aid to the rebels could 
continue under terms of the peace plan 
asked about this matter at a news conference the foreign 
minister declined to be specific but said naturally our 
relationship of good neighborliness and friendship with unita has 
not ended 
savimbi said last week that presidentelect george bush had told 
him us aid to unita would continue until the soviet union halted 
its military aid to the angolan government 
details of the peace plan have not been released sources have 
said the plan calls for the cubans to withdraw over a 27month 
period gradually moving troops northward away from unitas 
strongholds near the border with namibia 
south africa withdrew its troops from angola to namibia in august 
as part of a ceasefire agreed to in an earlier round of talks 
unita was not party to any of the talks and does not recognize the 
ceasefire 
many political analysts expect that free elections in namibia 
would be won by the southwest african peoples organization a 
leftist independence movement which since 1966 has waged a lowlevel 
guerrilla war against south african rule 
the territory is administered by an interim multiracial 
government installed by south africa three years ago parties 
represented in the coalition government are expected to form some 
type of unified front to campaign against swapo 
only about 70000 of namibias 14 million people are white but 
they have enjoyed special privileges under south african rule a 
final agreement on independence for the territory is expected to 
anger conservatives there and in south africa where the 5 million 
whites dominate the 26 million blacks

the ceiling on the size of home mortgages 
purchased by secondary mortgagemarket agencies likely will rise 
from 168700 this year to 187600 next year the government said 
tuesday that could mean cheaper mortgages by a quarter point or 
so for many homebuyers 
the changes must be approved by the boards of the federal home 
loan mortgage corp known as freddie mac and the federal national 
mortgage association or fannie mae 
both agencies were established by the government to buy mortgages 
and repackage them into securities for sale to investors the 
process is designed to make loans at competitive interest rates 
available to home buyers 
however mortgages exceeding the limits are considered 
nonconventional they cannot be sold through fannie mae and 
freddie mac and financial institutions generally charge somewhat 
higher rates because they often must hold them in their own 
portfolio 
the federal home loan bank board said the average price of homes 
financed by conventional mortgages was 136900 in early october an 
112 percent increase from a year earlier under the formula used by 
both freddie mac and fannie mae the maximum mortgage loan size will 
increase proportionately in january 
the increased limits will be particularly important in the 
northeast and on the west coast where average home prices are much 
higher than elsewhere in the country 
warren lasko executive vice president of the mortgage bankers 
association of america said potentially about 350000 home buyers 
8 to 10 percent of the market could benefit from the higher ceiling 
and save about a quarter of a percentage point on their mortgage 
rates on a mortgage of 175000 that amounts to 440 a year 
it doesnt knock your socks off but it helps he said 
meanwhile the bank board said the average rate on fixedrate 
mortgages offered in early october including addon fees known as 
points was 1082 percent down from 1095 percent in early 
september the average for the most popular type of adjustablerate 
mortgages those with caps on how high the rate can go fell from 
919 percent to 913 percent 
more recently rates have been rising freddie mac reported 
averages not including points of 1031 percent last week up from 
a recent low of 1012 percent two weeks earlier 
unfortunately we dont think theyve topped out yet lasko 
said were looking for interest rates to continue trending upward 
by a half to threequarters of a percentage point through the 
first quarter of 1989 and then move downward

the central committee on tuesday chose a 
candidate to replace outgoing premier karoly grosz who announced he 
would resign to concentrate on his duties as leader of the communist 
party 
the policymaking central committee did not release his name 
party spokesman laszlo major said the candidate first must be 
presented to parliament on thursday for approval 
grosz announced last month he intends to resign as premier by the 
end of december in order to concentrate on his position as communist 
party chief he was appointed to the post in may and replaced 
longtime leader janos kadar 
among those who have been considered top contenders for premier 
were miklos nemeth central committee secretary for economic 
affairs and reformists rezso nyers and imre pozsgay 
nemeth 40 the youngest member of the ruling politburo 
reportedly is the preferred choice of grosz 
since becoming premier in june 1987 grosz has set hungary on a 
course of economic reform aimed at reducing its 17 billion foreign 
debt 
nemeth like grosz reportedly advocates political and economic 
changes aimed at developing a market economy and closer ties to the 
european economic community he also however advocates stringent 
austerity measures to counter the 17 billion foreign debt 
last month parliament adopted legislation to ease the flow of 
hard currency into the country and loosen restrictions on 
establishing joint ventures with foreign companies 
on jan 1 hungary became the east european nation to introduce 
personal income and valueadded taxes but they have contributed to 
the 18 percent annual inflation rate and a drop in personal 
consumption 
hungarian and western analysts say the new premier must be able 
to rally the countrys 106 million people as dissatisfaction grows 
with inflation unemployment and sinking living standards 
nyers considered the father of hungarys economic reforms of 
1968 also advocates political and economic reforms within the 
framework of a socialistic society 
nyers was removed from the ruling politburo in 1974 after his 
economic reforms stalled and was reappointed to the ruling body in 
may 
pozsgay a champion of political pluralism gained wide 
popularity as head of the patriotic peoples front an umbrella 
organization for officially recognized cultural intellectual and 
trade union groups he was named to the politburo in may 
other names mentioned as possible candidates for premeir were 
budapest mayor pal ivanyi and ilona tatai head of the taurus rubber 
factory

trusted christian bodyguard was shooting his gun in a private villa 
near the presidential palace 
in an ensuing altercation after gegeo refused to stop odai hit 
him over the head with a bat gegeo died later in the hospital

an american among hostages taken 
into beirut from a twa jetliner hijacked in june 1985 testified 
tuesday that moslem radicals threatened to put them back on board 
and blow up the plane 
allyn conwell testifying at the trial of confessed hijacker 
mohammed ali hamadi also said he was convinced he would be shot 
when he and others were initially taken from the plane 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is charged with murder and air 
piracy in the hijacking during which us navy diver robert stethem 
was killed and 39 americans were held hostage for 17 days 
hamadi has confessed to the hijacking but denies killing stethem 
conwell a 43yearold houston executive said the last 39 
american hostages aboard the seized twa jetliner were taken off the 
plane while hamadi and his accomplice were sleeping 
he said four american servicemen earlier had been removed from 
the plane by hezbollah a radical shiite moslem group backed by 
iran while the remaining americans were in the custody of amal a 
more moderate shiite militia 
as delicate negotiations for the hostages release ran into 
snags amal officials told conwell the original hijackers were 
getting very upset over the lack of progress in negotiations he 
testified 
i was told the intention was to return all the hostages to the 
plane and blow it up conwell said 
the hostages were shifted around different locations in beirut 
until their release he said 
conwell who said he had been so terrorized that i was 
virtually immobile after the plane was hijacked on a flight from 
athens to rome told the court that conditions improved for the 
hostages once they were under control of amal 
i was under the impression that amal absolutely did not approve 
of the hijacking and the murder of stethem he testified i 
think they acted to the best of their ability in a chaotic 
situation 
during a break in the court proceedings jailers could not free 
hamadi from the court security room in which he is locked and had to 
use a cutting torch to open the door 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport in january 1987 after

rise of solidarity in 1980 in which walesa appeared briefly and 
man of marble about the disillusionment with the stalinist

a construction firm has designed a plan for a 
937mile water conservation tunnel that would run the length of 
japans main island and cost 25 trillion to build officials said 
tuesday 
the tunnel envisioned by hazamagumi a top civil engineering 
firm would run the length of mountain ranges forming the backbone 
of honshu island and serve as a conduit and reservoir for 
distribution of water said company spokesman sakai sato 
when utilized at 30 percent capacity the tunnel would hold about 
1225 billion cubic feet of water about twice the annual total 
water consumption of tokyo sato said 
the tunnel would be 330 feet in diameter and also could 
accommodate highspeed trains and electricity transmission 
still at the conceptual stage the major obstacle to building the 
tunnel would be the cost estimated at 247 trillion sato said 
the company designed the tunnel to end japans water conservation 
problems he said it could help prevent flooding and redistribute 
water from japans mountainous west and northeast which receive 
heavy snow to drier areas 
in years of abnormally light precipitation major cities in 
japan including tokyo face severe water shortages 
only 25 percent of japans water resources amounting to 11 
trillion cubic feet in a dry year is utilized most evaporates or 
runs into the sea

serb and ethnic albanian officials 
traded accusations tuesday over unrest in the tense southern 
province of kosovo and what sparked the biggest protests there in 
more than 40 years 
kosovo was reported calm but authorities braced for more small 
sporadic protests later 
on monday about 7000 people defied threats of a crackdown on 
demonstrations which erupted last thursday after two ethnic albanian 
leaders resigned under serbian pressure protesters swelled to 
100000 on saturday 
strong pressure was applied to keep the province calm monday 
hundreds of communist party activists were dispatched to schools 
homes and factories throughout the backward province to urge 
students and workers to stay off the streets 
but belgrade newspapers attacked ethnic albanian leaders tuesday 
for failing to control the unrest 
serbian speakers at a serbian communist party conference followed 
the lead of party chief slobodan milosevic in accusing kosovos 
ethnic albanian majority of fomenting counterrevolution 
in kosovo a senior ethnic albanian official said on condition of 
anonymity that he feared renewed unrest could erupt on a massive 
scale only if inflammatory statements were made at the conference or 
by belgrade media 
otherwise he likened expected unrest to small tremors 
compared to the weekends big earthquake 
at the belgrade conference delegate tomislav sekulic branded the 
kosovo protests outright antiserbian 
demonstrators had seemed careful however not to chant 
antiserbian slogans shouting instead yugoslavia yugoslavia 
and brotherhood unity 
ethnic albanian delegates appealed to serbs not to judge hastily 
what is happening now has nothing to do with the events of 
1981 said delegate sevdi choroli 
in 1981 both ethnic albanian and serbian communist leaders said 
riots in which at least nine people died were sparked by 40000 
ethnic albanians demanding their own republic in kosovo 
that would give the ethnic albanian majority the right to secede 
from the yugoslav federation serbs feel strongly about their 
ancient heartland of kosovo and charge ethnic albanians aim to 
secede and unite with neighboring albania 
the recent unrest however appears to be a response to 
milosevics campaign to make the serbian language mandatory in the 
judiciary policing and education in kosovo and to get more control 
over the province 
kosovo adminstratively is part of serbia but won broad autonomy 
under the 1974 constitution which yugoslav leaders now are trying 
to change so they can implement reforms to ease an unprecedented 
economic crisis 
the amendments have been approved by all six republics and both 
provinces 
in albania the leader ramiz alia criticized yugoslavia for a 
policy of alleged discrimination against ethnic albanians in kosovo 
but the absence of a strident attack signaled his interest in normal 
relations 
alia pointedly avoided any reference to the demonstrations but 
vaguely referred to the great difficulties the turbulent 
political situation and the national feuds in yugoslavia 
restraint was also clear in the following comment socialist 
albania is developing successfully relations of good neighborhood 
with greece and turkey with bulgaria and romania and is making 
efforts to create the same positive atmosphere in its relations with 
yugoslavia

donations to a thanksgiving food drive in 
maryland fell 70 percent this year leaving thousands of needy 
people facing bleak prospects for their holiday meal 
the maryland food banks prethanksgiving bags of plenty program 
collected 20000 bags of nonperishable goods last year as of 
monday only 5500 bags of food had been collected and a total of 
7000 were expected by tuesday when the program was to end 
as a result thousands of people who received food baskets last 
year will not get them this year food bank director bill ewing 
estimated that 30000 to 40000 people will benefit from this years 
drive compared with 125000 last year 
i cant even imagine it being any worse ewing said 
one woman was in tears erselle datcher a food bank worker 
said monday after making dozens of phone calls to inform church 
shelter and senior center workers that the program failed this year 
she runs a small church that doesnt have much money she wasnt 
able to get any turkeys or chickens so she just purchased some 
turkey wings and were not going to be able to help her fill her 40 
baskets the way wed like to 
ewing had no explanation for why the food drive failed just weeks 
after the united way exceeded its fundraising goal maybe our 
advertising was too cutesy stuff a bag this year but it 
shouldnt account for a 70 percent dropoff ewing said 
the drive has now been extended through sunday with an eye 
toward christmas 
we seem to have blown it for thanksgiving any response we get 
over the next few days well store and make available for a 
christmas basket he said

a 9yearold girl who has been 
living in her fathers adultsonly condominium since her mothers 
fatal cancer was diagnosed has until after the holiday season to 
move out the condos attorney said tuesday 
douglas neway representing the viewpoint condominium board of 
directors said jamie swartz must be out by jan 10 a letter he 
sent to her family said they must show by providing names of 
realestate brokers and other evidence a goodfaith effort in the 
meantime to sell their condo unit 
if the child is still in residence at the unit upon the 
expiration of this latest extension the board of directors will 
have no choice but to file a lawsuit seeking an injunction 
preventing the further violation of condominium rules the letter 
said 
jamies father and stepmother who own the condominium say they 
have been unable to sell the condo and cannot afford to move into 
another home while still paying the mortgage on it 
the extension was a relief to the family but the decision will 
cast a pall over their holidays said jill swartz jamies 
stepmother 
the holidays are not actually the time that people are actively 
out looking for homes she said i think the time element is 
working against us 
jamie had moved in temporarily in april after her mother maye 
swartz was hospitalized and later diagnosed as having cancer 
the condominium association agreed in july to allow jamie to stay 
at the apartment while her mother underwent chemotherapy but maye 
swartz died in september it had granted one extension before the 
latest threatened eviction 
jill swartz received a letter from the condominium association 
nov 10 saying it would seek an injunction to force jamie out 
neway said in a telephone interview that he and condo directors 
realized some would say they sound hardhearted 
ill admit that this is a great story neway said however 
as ive tried to make clear the condominium board has an obligation 
to the entire community 
a federal openhousing bill that takes effect in march is 
designed to protect families against discrimination in housing 
under the law buildings that are adult only could exclude 
children only if the managers or owners adopted a policy to rent or 
sell to the elderly only

a fourmonth dispute over whether a 
garden of cultivated weeds constitutes an eyesore or a living work 
of art has resulted in a new weed ordinance for this southern 
michigan city 
that means ladislav hanka wont have to take a lawn mower to the 
wildflower meadow in his front yard to the dismay of his nextdoor 
neighbor 
hanka protested an order from the city in july to mow the tall 
weeds in his yard claiming they are part of a wildflower garden he 
and his wife began nurturing when they moved to their home in july 
1987 
kalamazoo city commissioners sided with hanka on monday night and 
adopted a revised weed ordinance that allows residents to grow weeds 
up to 18 inches high 
hanka said the commissions action confirmed a residents right 
to deviate from the traditional englishstyle lawn when cutting 
grass 
its really facing facts and what is a coming trend in the 
country said hanka who grows queen annes lace and other tall 
wildflowers in his garden 
opponents including the vine neighborhood association contend 
the revised leaves the law open to potential abuse by negligent 
property owners 
we have to be sensitive to others in our neighborhood and the 
expectations they had about the appearance of their surroundings 
when they made their decision to live in the city said city 
commissioner bruce martin who voted against the amended ordinance 
scott kemple hankas nextdoor neighbor said the revised 
ordinance is too vague 
essentially he could do anything he wants to do over there and 
call it a meadow kemple said

us and canadian jewish leaders said tuesday 
that prime minister yitzhak shamir agreed to consult with them on 
the proposed who is a jew amendment but will not move to block 
the controversial bill 
we have received no assurances nothing whatsoever jewish 
agency chairman mendel kaplan said after a meeting with shamir 
the proposed legislation would modify israels law of return 
giving orthodox rabbis exclusive authority to approve conversions to 
judaism jewish converts would be granted automatic israeli 
citizenship only if converted by orthodox rabbis 
most american and canadian jews are members of the reform and 
conservative movements and see the amendment as a threat to their 
legitimacy as jews 
the amendment has become a bargaining chip in forming israels 
next government 
the 12 delegates said shamir agreed to set up a joint committee 
with the jewish agency to air the views of north american jews on 
the issue 
its a serious matter there are so many people who feel that 
with a change in the law of return millions of jews would be 
disenfrachised said walter hess executive vice president of the 
canadian branch of the united israel appeal 
shoshana cardin chairman of the uscanadian coalition on who 
is a jew said there is a tremendous sense of pain anguish and 
rejection there is a sense of being subjected to secondclass 
jewishness 
four ultraorthodox religious parties have demanded passage of 
the who is a jew amendment in exchange for supporting shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc in forming a coalition government shamir has 
pledged to back passage 
mr shamir has an ongoing commitment to the religious parties 
as he tries to forge a government ms cardin told reporters he 
said hell see if theres a way to remove this as a burning issue of 
the day 
but shamir aide yossi ahimeir said shamir told the jewish leaders 
he would stick to his promise to the religious parties 
he explained to them that the matter was a formal internal 
israeli matter that should not create a rift or misunderstanding 
with diaspora jewry ahimeir said 
in a separate meeting tuesday foreign minister shimon peres 
assured the us and canadian delegation his leftleaning labor 
party would vote against passage 
meir shitrit a likud supporter and treasurer of the jewish 
agency in israel said he feared passage could cost the agency 100 
million in lost contributions next year 
the visiting leaders said the united jewish appeal in the united 
states raised about 300 million for israel last year the canadian 
contribution was estimated at about 25 million 
shamir must consider forming a coaltion government because nov 1 
elections to the 120seat knesset or parliament gave likud 40 
seats and labor 39 the rest went to leftist rightist and religious 
parties

white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater softened his attack on a congressionally passed ethics 
bill tuesday as the chief house sponsor of the legislation accused 
fitzwater of using flat lies to criticize it 
fitzwater declined to spell out what complaints administration 
officials and others had raised about the bill saying he didnt 
want to prejudice president reagans decision but a day 
earlier the spokesman had told reporters that some lobbying 
restrictions on former executive branch employees were so extreme 
that they would preclude a former president from calling an 
incumbent president 
fitzwater implying reagan may veto the bill also had maintained 
that george bush as a former vice president wouldnt be allowed to 
call the us park service to get a camping permit 
rep barney frank dmass the principal house sponsor of the 
postgovernment restrictions act of 1988 hotly disagreed with this 
description 
addressing fitzwaters statement about former presidents being 
barred from giving advice to incumbent presidents frank called that 
interpretation one of the flat lies of the white house spokesman 
in the first place the bill only prevents you from doing this 
lobbying if you are doing it for pay the congressman said in a 
telephone interview tuesday with the associated press 
if jimmy carter wanted to talk to ronald reagan about any 
issue theres absolutely nothing that prevents that he said 
secondly the bill only applies for a year after leaving office 
and again only if compensation is involved 
of fitzwaters statement about bush frank said that too is 
just a lie 
the bill specifically allows you to do any lobbying for 
yourself or your own business he said in fact if george bush 
went back to his oil company he could lobby for it the 
restrictions only apply if youre doing it for compensation and for 
other people 
fitzwater could not be reached immediately for comment on franks 
statements 
frank joined three other members of congress in a letter to 
reagan on tuesday in which they said the bill represents a unique 
opportunity for the president and congress to restore public 
confidence in government 
the legislation slows the revolving door between government and 
highpriced lobbying which has long distorted the purpose of 
government service said the letter which was signed by frank 
along with howard wolpe dmich marcy kaptur dohio and dan 
glickman dkan 
fitzwater initially had seemed to send a presidential veto signal 
when he told reporters monday the bill had drawn some very strong 
opposition from cabinet officials 
but on tuesday fitzwater said i dont know when asked whether 
reagan will exercise his constitutional right of pocket veto by 
refusing to sign the bill by 1201 am est saturday 
we dont know what the presidents going to do he may sign 
it the spokesman said during a briefing at a seaside resort while 
the president continued a sixday vacation at his ranch north of 
santa barbara 
he did say that people both inside the administration and outside 
the government were inundating the white house with advice on 
whether reagan should sign the bill 
he said reagan will receive all those views and digest them at 
his leisure on the ranch and then make his judgment known by 
memorandum that comes back to us 
fitzwater said some members of the administration such as 
interior secretary donald hodel had been uncharacteristically 
public with their concerns about the legislation which some critics 
say would discourage people from serving in the government 
hodel and other administration officials including 
transportation secretary jim burnley have said the bill imposes 
overly strict limitations on people who leave the executive branch 
for the private sector 
the bill imposes new lobbying restrictions on former executive 
branch officials and applies lobbying restraints for the first time 
to former members of congress 
what has some in the administration particularly concerned is a 
provision in the bill which was passed overwhelmingly in the house 
and by voice vote in the senate which would prohibit former 
executive branch employees from merely aiding or advising their 
former employers 
in a memorandum to the office of management and budget hodel 
lamented the particularly obnoxious differences in treatment of 
former executive branch employees and members of congress and their 
staffs 
the bill also provides maximum penalties of 250000 in fines and 
five years in prison

yasser arafat said tuesday the united states 
has agreed to issue him a visa so he can address the un general 
assembly but the state department said the plo chairman hasnt even 
applied for one 
state department officials acknowledged privately however that 
egypt and other moderate arab nations had asked that arafat be 
granted a visa 
arafat indicated president hosni mubarak of egypt helped obtain a 
promise of a visa the palestine liberation organization leader 
spoke to reporters after meeting with foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid who said last week that egypt was interceding on 
arafats behalf 
president mubarak informed me today through dr esmat 
abdelmeguid that the us administration has agreed to grant me an 
entry visa so i can address the united nations arafat said 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said no 
visa application had been received and if one arrived it would be 
given severe scrutiny 
redman said on nov 10 that the reagan administration would take 
into account applicable laws and regulations and other pertinent 
circumstances if arafat requested a visa 
under the 1947 agreement placing un headquarters in new york 
the united states is not supposed to impose any impediment to 
transit of people involved in official business with the united 
nations 
congress has authorized denying visas to people who support 
terrorism however and many terrorist acts have been blamed on plo 
factions over the years 
washington said last week the declaration of an independent state 
by the palestine national council which acts as the plo 
legislature did not go far enough in renouncing terrorism and was 
too ambiguous in its implicit recognition of israel 
in a letter responding to 51 us senators who asked that arafat 
be denied a visa secretary of state george p shultz said he has 
no desire whatever to see arafat in the united states 
l paul bremer iii head of the state department 
counterterrorism office said tuesday it is simply incorrect to 
assert that by its recent declaration the plo renounced terrorism 
arafat did not specify a date for his second address to the 
general assembly the first in 1974 occurred after the plo was 
accepted as a un observer

oil prices soared tuesday after opec 
ministers raised hopes the cartel might be near agreement on 
curtailing production but the market retreated when ministers 
backed away from their optimism 
the price swings centered around comments by iranian oil minister 
gholamreza aghazadeh who said early in the day an agreement was 
possible but then made a dramatic aboutface 
im ready to be here for several days he said after emerging 
from a closeddoor meeting with other ministers late in the day 
there has been no progress said a senior member of an opec 
delegation who agreed to talk about the negotiations only if he was 
not identified 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries has been trying 
to devise a new plan to limit the cartels output but it has been 
snagged by a dispute over whether iraq should have a quota equal to 
that of iran 
oil prices have been running nearly 25 percent below opecs 
benchmark of 18 a barrel because of an oversupply of oil on the 
world market 
aghazadehs early optimistic comment electrified the oil markets 
sending the price of the january contract for west texas 
intermediate crude soaring 142 a barrel on the new york mercantile 
exchange but when he changed his tone the january contract fell 
back and ended the day up 88 cents at 1386 
ecuadors energy minister diego tamariz said the ministers from 
opecs 13 member nations would resume formal talks wednesday 
afternoon 
the ministers opened their winter conference monday but adjourned 
after 90 minutes so members could meet privately to try to resolve 
the dispute between iraq and iran who ended an 8year war in august 
iraq wants the same quota in any new cartel accord as iran but 
aghazadeh has refused 
i would never concede to parity he told reporters after 
meeting for nearly an hour with ministers from nigeria indonesia 
venezuela and algeria 
issam abdul raheem alchalabi the iraq oil minister was in the 
hotel at the same time but apparently was not part of the 
discussions with aghazadeh 
earlier in the day aghazadeh had told reporters i think we 
can reach an agreement 
that remark was bolstered by an optimistic comment the iraqi oil 
minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi were working on an 
agreement that will settle all the problems including that of iraq 
and iran 
opec president rilwanu lukman who also is nigerias oil 
minister said the cartels regular winter meeting would not end 
without an agreement 
those positive comments caught the oil markets by surprise and 
triggered the runup in price analysts said

a modest package of natural gas production and 
use incentives could more than pay for itself in benefits to the 
economy according to a study released tuesday by two former energy 
department officials 
the former officials william martin and scott campbell said 
their proposals could boost the gross national product by 9 billion 
annually by 1995 and 29 billion by 2010 and increase tax revenues 
14 billion a year within two years of enactment 
the principal costs of their package would be 350 million lost 
annual government revenue through a 10 percent tax credit for 
drilling of both exploratory wells and wells aimed at finding 
pockets of bypassed gas in old reservoirs 
certain other incentives such as delaying royalty payments on 
government lands could cost an additional 50 million a year they 
said they also called for spending 100 million a year for 
increased research in geology 
martin former deputy secretary and campbell former director of 
the departments office of policy planning and analysis resigned 
their positions in the fall to join the presidential campaign of 
vice president george bush 
both bush and his unsuccessful democratic opponent michael 
dukakis said during the campaign they would make increased use of 
natural gas the centerpiece of their energy policies 
campbell said the study was not aimed at the bush transition team 
or anyone in particular but rather the marketplace of ideas 
using computer models of the economy in a study paid for by 
several gas companies martin and campbell sketched two futures 
one a business as usual scenario and the other incorporating 
their proposals they assumed that the economy will grow at 25 
percent per year and overall energy use will grow at slightly less 
than 1 percent per year 
their proposals called for requiring urban buses to switch to gas 
or other cleanburning fuels for the cleanair benefits those fuels 
would bring and use of gas by 5 percent of all cars in 2010 it 
also calls for doubling the use of gas by electric utilities in 
part through modifications to clean air legislation that would 
permit its intermittent use to reduce pollution streamlined 
procedures for building new gas pipelines and more use of gas to 
power air large commercial air conditioners 
they assumed energy prices would rise in the 1990s to about 450 
per thousand cubic feet of gas and about 3750 a barrel for oil 
compared with about 150 per thousand cubic feet and 14 a barrel 
today 
under the proposals gas use would be 241 trillion cubic feet in 
2010 compared with 182 trillion cubic feet under the business as 
usual scenario and 177 trillion cubic feet last year about 16 
percent of the gas would be imported from canada mexico algeria 
and possibly others compared with about 5 percent from canada last 
year 
imported oil would be 109 million barrels a day or 67 percent of 
us consumption vs 125 million barrels a day and 72 percent under 
the business as usual forecast and about 59 million barrels a 
day and 38 percent last year 
coal use would be reduced to 1150 tons from 1330 tons in the 
business as usual projection but still 42 percent above last 
years 810 million tons

presidentelect george bush promised tuesday to 
never neglect our friends in this hemisphere as he met incoming 
mexican president carlos salinas de gortari and heralded the 
election victory of canadian prime minister brian mulroney as a 
triumph for free trade 
on a key domestic subject the vice president also told 
republican governors he would name negotiators for budget talks with 
congress on the first day of my presidency but he also said he 
viewed his election as a mandate against new taxes 
he said he hasnt decided on a defense secretary despite news 
reports he will name former sen john tower of texas 
new hampshire gov john sununu who will be bushs 
chiefofstaff told reporters the vice president still was 
looking at a lot of people for the post a spokeswoman for tower 
said he was on hold 
bush and salinas used upbeat language to describe their twohour 
session at the johnson space center in texas they gave few 
specifics in brief remarks afterward but bush aides said topics had 
included drugs immigration trade and mexicos 102 billion 
international debt 
i am absolutely confident after this initial visit that were 
both committed to improving a bilateral relationship that is 
essential in my view as far as the united states of america is 
concerned bush said 
salinas called the session a positive respectful and cordial 
dialogue which i am certain will do a great deal to improve the 
relations between mexico and the united states 
bush thanked salinas for coming to his hometown salinas who has 
degrees from harvard university in the united states invited the 
vice president to visit him in mexico city 
before tuesdays meeting bush had called it the first of many 
important bilateral meetings he planned with world leaders 
in toronto mulroney fresh from his victory on monday said he 
had spoken to bush by telephone and was willing to meet with him 
before the us leaders inauguration on jan 20 
accompanying the vice president were treasury secretary nicholas 
brady whom bush has announced will keep that job and james a 
baker iii bushs choice for secretary of state 
aides said the lunch session between the two presidentselect 
would likely cover trade the ailing mexican economy and drug 
enforcement but bush himself said in advance that there was no 
specific agenda 
speaking with reporters on the trip from washington he said the 
meeting was just a visit to manifest the importance i place in our 
mexicanus relations 
addressing the republican governors association in point clear 
ala bush said the us relationship with mexico is very very 
important we must never take it for granted 
as i look at the world we must never neglect our friends in 
this hemisphere in our own front yard bush said mentioning both 
mexico and canada 
he told the governors group the outcome of the canadian 
elections was a spectacular win for mulroney and an endorsement 
by canadians of the freetrade pact negotiated by mulroney and the 
reagan administration 
that indeed was a referendum on whether were going to have 
more markets and freer trade both ways bush said 
mulroneys conservatives won the seats needed in the canadian 
house of commons to save the pact which will phase out virtually 
all tariffs quotas and other trade barriers between the two nations 
over ten years 
the vice president who has called for negotiating a similar 
freetrade deal with mexico phoned mulroney from alabama to 
congratulate him according to spokesman stephen hart 
in his address to the gop governors bush said that in addition 
to engaging in early deficitreduction talks with congress he 
planned to convene a conference of all 50 governors to talk about 
education 
as for federalstate relations bush promised to continue what 
ronald reagan and i began in 1980 to stop the flow of power to 
washington and return it where it belongs to the states 
bush told reporters he had made no decision yet on his defense 
secretary and he indicated there would be no announcement this week 
he said he hopes to finish naming his cabinet within a month but 
expressed mild irritation about reading these stories about what i 
have decided 
some day somebody will understand that i set how those things 
are going to work he said 
the tower story is not right no decision has been made bush 
added 
pressed on the subject later at a photo session with salinas 
bush would say only that he wanted a person as defense secretary 
who will fulfill the defense initiatives i discussed in the 
campaign 
sununu said there is a feeling that there are two things 
required of a defense secretary ability to deal with congress and 
someone who has management capacity perhaps beyond the beltway 
the latter a reference to the highway loop around washington 
he declined to say whether tower the former chairman of the 
senate armed services committee had such qualities but when asked 
if tower could be ruled out sununu said i wouldnt rule out 
anybody with that kind of experience at this point 
bush traveled to texas on the same aircraft that carried 
president john f kennedys body and president lyndon johnson back 
from dallas 25 years ago tuesday

there is not enough data suggesting silicone 
breast implants are a health hazard to warrant barring them from the 
medical market a federal advisory panel concluded tuesday 
however the sevenmember committee convened by the food and drug 
administration decided to meet again in two months to consider any 
additional evidence before making a final recommendation 
assuming no significant new evidence surfaces during that time 
the panel will renew its tentative call for three specific steps to 
study the safety of the gel implants over the next few years 
after a full day of testimony and deliberation tuesday the 
committee unanimously called for 
establishment of a national registery of women who have breast 
implants so longrange studies can be carried out to determine 
whether there is a heightened risk of breast cancer or other health 
problems 
drafting of a mandatory standardized consent form to be signed 
by any prospective patient for a breast implant before the procedure 
can be done 
an fda policy to keep physicians and the public at large aware 
of any new information as it develops from whatever longrange 
studies are devised 
an estimated 2 million us women have had silicone gel implants 
over the past two decades including about 15 percent who used the 
procedure for reconstruction of breast tissue surgically removed 
during cancer treatment 
the rest simply wanted larger breasts 
the fda has invoked a procedure whereby the gel implants will 
have to undergo the type of scientific review normally associated 
with new medical devices even though the implants were already on 
the market in 1976 when congress gave the fda authority over such 
products 
since they were already on the market implants and several other 
socalled medical devices already in widespread use condoms are 
one example which were given grandfather approval under the 
legislation 
referring to breast implants the fda said earlier this month it 
has decided there are sufficient concerns about these products to 
call for premarket approval applications this means that in order 
for the implants to remain on the market manufacturers will have to 
supply fda with scientific data demonstrating that they are safe and 
effective 
however the agency noted that the law sets a schedule giving the 
makers of such grandfathered products time to provide 
documentation for the safety of their products and said in the case 
of silicone implants the deadline can be no sooner than december 
1990 
meanwhile the agency has said it will see that the labeling 
information manufacturers are required to supply doctors explains 
adequately what is known about potential risks 
even though the law sets up a timetable for manufacturers to 
submit data to justify the safety and efficacy of their products 
the fda could move to remove implants under emergency procedures if 
it determined there was a clear health risk 
the significance of the advisory panels conclusion was that it 
saw no need to invoke such extraordinary steps

latvias legislature ended a special session 
tuesday without voting on a populist organizations demand for 
autonomy in the baltic republic activists reported 
the same question came up in lithuanias legislature last friday 
and no vote was taken but estonias legislature approved a 
declaration of sovereignty on nov 16 along with a 
constitutional amendment declaring the republic autonomous in all 
areas except defense and foreign policy 
janis dinevich said the latvian legislators took no action on 
proposed changes in the latvian constitution he serves on the 
governing council of the latvian peoples front which has pushed 
for autonomy 
in principle they didnt touch the republican constitution 
dinevich said by telephone theyre not looking at the republican 
constitution 
he said leaders of the peoples front would meet very very 
soon to plan a response 
in the caucasus site of a long territorial dispute between the 
republics of armenia and azerbaijan the kremlins representative 
halted an armenian legislative session tuesday because of ethnic 
tension caused by protests in azerbaijan official reports said 
arkady volsky sent by the kremlin to oversee its policy in the 
area flew immediately to stepanakert capital of the 
nagornokarabakh region claimed by both republics said an editor of 
the official armenpress news agency 
ethnic rioting in sumgait azerbaijan last february cost the 
lives of at least 32 people 
commissions of the supreme soviet the national parliament have 
said the estonian constitutional amendment violates the national 
constitution national newspapers have accused estonian and 
lithuanian activists of causing ethnic tension 
exactly what latvias legislature did in its 12hour session was 
unclear to those who listened on live broadcasts 
except for the best lawyers in the republic no one can say 
said andrei tsirulis editor of the youth newspaper padomju 
jaunatne tsirulis said by telephone from riga the capital he 
would have to wait for official reports released in the morning to 
find out what the legislators approved 
mikhail bombin correspondent for the moscow human rights journal 
expresskhronika said latvian president anatoly gorbunov told the 
legislature there was no need to vote on greater autonomy because of 
changes being made in proposed amendments to the soviet constitution 
dozens of people supporting autonomy gathered outside the 
legislative chamber bombin said 
activists in latvia estonia and lithuania have demanded greater 
economic and cultural freedom under president mikhail s gorbachevs 
plan for increased local control the three baltic republics were 
independent between the world wars but the soviet union took them 
over in 1940 under an agreement with nazi germany 
baltic activists claim proposed amendments to the soviet 
constitution will reduce local authority rather than increasing it 
those reporting on tuesdays developments said the legislature 
approved proposals for changes to those amendments but the details 
were not made clear during the live broadcast 
pravda the communist party newspaper continued its criticism of 
peoples front groups in the baltic states warning lithuanian 
activists tuesday that democracy without responsibility can turn 
into evil 
it said leaders of sajudis the lithuanian group are not 
afraid to verbally abuse separate individuals and the authorities or 
paint or print posters which have no other aim than provocation 
a special commission of the national parliament has recommended 
some changes in amendments proposed by gorbachev to limit powers of 
a new national council which originally would have been able to 
strike down laws adopted by the legislatures of the 15 soviet 
republics 
tsirulis said the peoples front of latvia had asked the 
legislators in riga to take legal measures so the republic will 
have sovereignty inside the soviet union 
the latvian people support the proposals of the peoples front 
and want them adopted he said

the reagan administration will need 35 billion 
in deficit reductions in its final budget and will get there in part 
by proposing approximately 15 billion in cuts in government benefit 
programs the presidents chief budget director said tuesday 
joseph r wright director of the office of management and 
budget said social security will not be touched but he indicated 
that government health programs such as medicare would be prime 
targets for savings 
in a wideranging interview wright said reagans final budget 
would be a conservative document reflecting the presidents 
priorities in defense spending and his continued efforts to reduce 
the size of the federal government in other areas 
in that regard wright said the budget would propose a 2 percent 
increase in defense spending after taking inflation into account 
defense spending this year accounts for roughly 30 percent of the 
11 trillion budget 
wright rejected arguments that the reagan budget was being 
drafted with a view toward paving the way for presidentelect george 
bush to come in with a kinder gentler budget that would reduce 
the presidents defense spending request and use the savings to 
boost spending for domestic programs 
this is not a crash and burn budget wright said the 
preident wants to put together a reasonable responsible 
conservative budget 
wright said the president had established as a guiding principle 
that the benefits received by the elderly and poor would not be 
touched 
he said reagan also insisted as he has in the past that social 
security be placed offlimits for any budget savings 
but wright said this left open such expensive government programs 
as medicare which provides insurance for the elderly 
he said that while outofpocket expenses for the elderly would 
not be increased the administration was looking at savings through 
reductions in payments made to hospitals and doctors 
wright would not give any breakdown on how the approximately 15 
billion in savings would be obtained or how it would be allocated 
among governemnt benefit programs saying omb was still in the 
process of reviewing budget appeals raised by the various agencies 
wright did provide a new estimate of 35 billion in reductions 
which will be needed to reach the grammrudman deficit target of 
100 billion for the 1990 fiscal year which begins on oct 1 
that is 3 billion higher than the figure omb used just two weeks 
ago and reflects the revised economic forecast the administration 
released tuesday showing that the drought had had a greater impact 
on economic growth than first believed 
wright said the administration fully intended to meet the 100 
billion deficit target for 1990 and would propose program changes 
that would bring the budget into balance by 1993 
wright said this would be accomplished by proposing no new 
taxes however he would not rule out recommendations the 
administration has made in the past to boost revenues by various 
types of user fees and by selling some federal assets he would not 
give any estimate of how much money would be raised by increasing 
revenues 
the budget director who took over in october from former omb 
director james a miller iii said he had not had contact with the 
bush transition team in drawing up reagans final spending plan 
but wright said he believed the new administration would have no 
difficulty in making modifications to the basic document to fit 
priorities bush mentioned during the campaign 
other areas in which the administration was likely to look for 
savings included agricultural subsidy programs and retirement 
benefits for federal employees wright said 
he indicated that many of the spending cuts and proposed hikes in 
user fees would be proposals that the administration has proposed in 
the past only to have them rejected by congress 
but wright said he did not believe reagans final budget would 
provoke any firestorm from congress

john f kennedys family and friends paused 
tuesday to celebrate his life and mourn the dreadful moment 25 years 
ago when the youthful president was murdered in dallas and the 
heartbeat of a nation stood still 
kennedy was remembered in the salutes of an elite army unit in 
the simple graveside tribute of his longtime secretary in a 
private mass for his widow and children in a vigil in the capitol 
rotunda and with flowers at home and abroad including the single 
white rose left by his youngest and only surviving brother at a 
historic meadow in england 
although no official ceremonies were held in dallas about 2500 
people thronged dealey plaza where kennedy was felled by an 
assassins rifle as he waved to crowds from an open limousine at 
midday nov 22 1963 
twenty people clapsed hands along the motorcade route tuesday 
and a crucifix and two bouquets of flowers were deposited at the 
approximate spot on elm street where the president was struck 
a note on one bouquet read we still miss you nov 22 on 
the other the message read after 25 years we still love you 
john schoolteacher jean hill who saw kennedy killed that day 
brought her 50 thirdgraders to the scene 
the presidents widow jacqueline kennedy onassis and her two 
children john jr and caroline attended a private mass at st 
thomas mores roman catholic church in new york city a spokeswoman 
for the former first lady said the family planned no public 
appearances 
in washington hundreds of former peace corps volunteers ended a 
24hour vigil in the capitol rotunda and attended a memorial mass at 
st matthews roman catholic cathedral where kennedys funeral 
service was held 
officiating at the mass was the rev theodore hesburgh a former 
peace corps adviser who also took part in kennedys funeral service 
hesburgh the retired longtime president of notre dame recalled 
that when kennedy was killed the heartbeat of a nation stood 
still 
he told the former volunteers that if kennedy was here today 
hed probably say that you are the people who delivered the message 
i gave to the world and that the peace corps will be my best and 
brightest memory 
eunice kennedy shriver the presidents sister and a blackclad 
ethel kennedy widow of sen robert f kennedy dny who was 
assassinated in june 1968 made earlymorning visits to the two 
kennedy gravesites at arlington national cemetery 
mrs shriver said she hoped people would remember john kennedy 
for the high points of his life the laughter and the vision 
ethel kennedy was one of the first mourners to appear at the 
cemetery when the gates opened at 8 am she knelt silently before 
the eternal flame that burns at the presidents grave and then 
walked to her husbands grave nearby 
i think for the family its a private moment she said 
its a wonderful outpouring of love 
evelyn lincoln the late presidents personal secretary made her 
annual pilgrimage to the grave and laid three red roses near the 
eternal flame its the least i can do she said 
about 30 uniformed green berets the us army special forces 
unit created by kennedy laid a large wreath at the grave they then 
formed a semicircle and saluted their former commander in chief 
members of kennedys former white house staff attended a mass at the 
cemetery amphitheater and placed a bouquet of roses on his grave 
the presidents only surviving brother sen edward m kennedy 
dmass laid a single white rose at the foot of a british memorial 
to the president at runnymede england west of london during a 
private visit with friends 
wearing a black trenchcoat the senator crossed himself and said 
a silent prayer before the memorial a large slab of stone on the 
side of a hill at the place where king john in 1215 granted the 
charter of civil and political liberties known as the magna carta 
we think its extremely important to celebrate the life of 
president kennedy rather than the tragedy kennedy told reporters 
were focusing on the birthday may 29 and the hope of his life 
rather than dwelling upon his loss 
in the vaulted capitol rotunda where the presidents body lay in 
state 25 years ago the last of an estimated 450 former peace corps 
volunteers or their surrogates completed a 24hour vigil of readings 
and songs dedicated to kennedy who founded the overseas development 
agency in march 1961 
former sen paul tsongas dmass who was a peace corps 
volunteer in ethiopia when kennedy was killed told his audience 
that only part of john kennedy died 25 years ago the best part of 
him is alive and here in all of us 
sen christopher dodd dconn who was a volunteer in the 
dominican republic in 196668 said the peace corps was a living 
memorial to kennedy and its volunteers will always be our best 
ambassadors

as the largest metropolitan area on the 
uscanadian border detroit could evolve as a commercial center 
under the free trade agreement that got a boost when conservatives 
won canadas election an economist said tuesday 
business leaders in michigan envision a developing 
chicagototoronto trade area with detroit in the middle a center 
for traderelated accounting brokerage and other services 
i would expect that there will be an increase in trade and 
traderelated services consultants and other service providers in 
detroit will have access to the vast growing market in ontario and 
by the same token canadians will have better access to michigan 
markets said wayne state university economist david verway who

it will represent a brand new market for small businesses that 
are able to see that potential small consultants architects 
people in the construction trades he said 
after mondays victory canadian conservatives are expected to 
push the free trade agreement through parliament next month 
in 10 years the pact would phase out tariffs on the 22 percent 
of canadian exports still subject to united states duties and on the 
35 percent of us exports still subject to canadian duties 
the immediate impact on the annual 257 billion in trade between 
canada and michigan will be slight eighty percent of that trade 
already moves duty free because of the autopact which lets vehicle 
manufacturers ship new vehicles and parts across the border without 
tariffs 
but business leaders are hopeful the free trade agreement will 
hold commercial benefits for border states like michigan and cities 
like buffalo ny located 90 miles to the south of toronto 
several developers have proposed trade centers that would help 
alleviate congestion on the international peace bridge a threelane 
bridge that connects buffalo with fort erie ontario

for automakers in detroit one hours drive to the south and flint 
one hour to the west 
patterson said the area has plants owned by canadian companies 
also supplying the automakers with springs door locks and the like

the government announced plans tuesday to establish 
controls on its secret service mi5 sell off billions of dollars of 
state utilities and require any political candidate in northern 
ireland to renounce violence 
the measures were part of a farreaching legislative program for 
the next year the 10th written by prime minister margaret 
thatchers conservative government read aloud by queen elizabeth 
ii at the glittering opening of parliament 
despite immediate protests from the opposition and from proira 
or moderate roman catholic groups in northern ireland most of the 
measures were virtually certain of passage by the 650member house 
of commons where mrs thatcher has a huge 101seat majority 
by tradition mrs thatcher and other members of the house of 
commons stood at the back entrance to the unelected house of lords 
while the queen in long white gown and jeweled crown announced the 
program to rows of erminerobed peers and diplomats 
a bill will be introduced to put the security service on a 
statutory basis said the queen announcing that formal operating 
rules will be drawn up for the first time for mi5 
but mrs thatcher later made it clear the shadowy service which 
deals with domestic security will remain accountable only to 
cabinet officials and not parliament as critics have demanded mi5 
currently reports to a cabinet subcommittee 
officials said the measures would not apply to mi6 britains 
other secret service agency which gathers intelligence from abroad 
some analysts predicted the move will tighten agents lifelong 
secrecy oaths following the governments failed attempt through 
courts in several countries to suppress spycatcher the memoirs 
of retired agent peter wright 
wright claimed in his book that mi5 tried to destabilize the 
1970s leftofcenter labor party government bugged foreign 
embassies and plotted to assassinate egyptian president gamal abdul 
nasser 
the proposed new laws include a liberalization of the 1911 
official secrets act although critics note the proposals still 
would not allow civil servants who leak unauthorized documents to 
argue they acted in the public interest 
the 16 proposed bills included mrs thatchers plans to sell off 
the stateowned water and electricity utilities 
the sales denounced by the opposition labor party are the 
biggest and most controversial of mrs thatchers massive 
privatization program and will raise an estimated 55 billion 
for northern ireland where sectarian violence has been met by 
increasingly controversial measures by the thatcher government any 
candidate running for any elected political office would have to 
sign an oath rejecting violence under the measure such candidates 
could be sued by other politicians protestant opponents or 
members of the public and banned from office 
the mainly roman catholic irish republican army is fighting to 
end british rule of the protestantdominated province 
the government is determined never to give in to the 
terrorist mrs thatcher declared later in the commons launching 
a sixday debate on the queens speech 
officials said despite the law providing for the proposed 
nonviolence pledge which is aimed at members of the outlawed 
iras legal political front sinn fein candidates can say what 
they like during the election campaign 
sinn fein has 59 elected members of local councils and one member 
of the house of commons gerry adams 
further repression the increasing erosion of our few remaining 
civil liberties and british efforts to marginalize sinn fein are not 
the way to resolve the conflict said sinn fein spokesman danny 
morrison 
state investigators would also be able to demand from banks 
details of accounts through which the ira is suspected of moving 
funds raised through legitimate businesses or racketeering 
in another measure the government outlined its first bill to 
curb job discrimination mainly against the catholic minority in 
northern ireland 
the new measure will force businesses with 10 employees or more 
to monitor the religious makeup of the work force 
the proposed laws also included a new attempt to curb britains 
notoriously violent soccer fans by forcing clubs to register 
members only cardcarrying members will be allowed into stadiums 
and spectators convicted of violence can be banned for up to five 
years

a judge ordered nine people jailed tuesday 
as part of a fraudandforgery probe of the church of scientology 
three americans including the churchs president were among 71 
people arrested 
judge jose maria vazquez honrubia said he was still questioning 
people arrested during a police sweep of alleged scientology members 
on sunday the raid capped a ninemonth investigation into 
complaints by spaniards who said they had been bilked by the church 
questioning of suspects was delayed two hours tuesday after a 
bomb threat forced the evacuation of madrids 21st district court 
vazquez honrubia told reporters that of 71 people arrested nine 
were ordered to prison pending further investigation and that 14 
still were being held for questioning 
another 47 were questioned and released including six foreigners 
ordered expelled from spain the judge said it was still uncertain 
whether one other person arrested sunday would be freed or 
imprisoned 
spanish law allows examining magistrates to hold suspects up to 
48 hours without charge judges can order suspects to prison if they 
feel further investigation is warranted 
among those arrested sunday was heber jentzsch a los angeles 
resident former hollywood actor and current president of the 
controversial church of scientology international 
it was unclear whether jentzsch was still held a court clerk 
initially said jentzsch was among those ordered to prison pending 
further investigation but vazquez honrubia later said he had not 
yet questioned jentzsch 
jentzsch was among two other americans arrested the judge said 
people of 14 nationalities were seized 
authorities said the 71 people were arrested during raids on a 
madrid hotel where the group was holding a meeting the 
headquarters of narconon a drug rehabilitation program and other 
programs associated with the church of scientology 
the raids took place after a ninemonth police probe during 
which wiretaps indicated the group was planning an international 
meeting in the city the judge said 
he said the probe was prompted by complaints from spaniards who 
said they had been swindled out of money through drug rehabilitation 
programs and other activities related to the church of scientology 
vazquez honrubia said charges that would be brought include 
fraud illegal association coercion forgery of public documents 
tax evasion and failure to meet social security payments 
heroin use is widespread in spain particularly among the 
nations 18to25yearolds 45 percent of whom are unemployed and 
have never held jobs 
a woman at the los molinos narconon center in madrid said 60 
people were undergoing treatment involving vitamins exercise and 
counseling the program costs 1600 a month 
spains annual per capita income is less than 8000 
in a statement monday in washington the church of scientology 
condemned the raid 
whoever is behind these acts of harassment obviously stands to 
profit from increased drug proliferation and addiction the 
statement said 
sylvia standard a church spokeswoman in los angeles said 
jentzsch is a former actor who appeared in the film paint your 
wagon she said he was elected president of the church of 
scientology international in 1982 
hes been very personally involved for years in drug 
rehabilitation she said 
litigation is pending against the organization in the united 
states where it was founded in 1954 by l ron hubbard a science 
fiction author whose books still are widely publicized hubbard who 
wrote dianetics the modern science of mental health died in 
1986 
in 1984 the us government began an investigation of hubbards 
tax returns after the internal revenue service said it suspected 
millions of dollars in church funds had been transferred to hubbard 
to protect the churchs taxexempt status and to avoid paying taxes 
scientologists said the government conspired to harass the 
organization in violation of its religious freedom the supreme 
court is considering the case

the wife of a naval intelligence officer 
convicted of spying for israel said in a prison interview tuesday 
she has never spied and complained that authorities are ignoring her 
medical problems 
i dont know classified information this is well known in the 
justice department and the bureau of prisons anne pollard said 
yet for some unknown reason i am singled out as is my husband in 
terms of our first amendment rights 
ive never committed espionage in my life i never would she 
said 
a justice department representative sat across from mrs pollard 
at the federal prison camp to guard against any leak of secret 
information and to limit the interview to one hour 
her husband jonathan jay pollard has admitted selling 
classified information to israel from 1984 until his arrest in 
november 1985 for as much as 2500 a month 
pollard a jew said he began working as a spy after deciding the 
united states wasnt providing israel with the information it needed 
to protect its security according to court documents he is serving 
a life prison term 
mrs pollard 28 was found guilty of conspiracy to receive 
embezzled government property and possession of national defense 
documents the charges stem from her attempt to deliver a suitcase 
containing government documents to her husband after his operation 
was uncovered by federal authorities 
he had called her and asked for her help according to court 
documents she is serving a fiveyear prison term 
when my husband called me i merely responded to his request 
thats what i felt ethically a wife should do she said 
mrs pollard refused to answer when asked how long she had known 
about her husbands spy activities saying only i have known 
about my husbands ideology since the first day i met him 
she also refused to say if she knew her husband was being paid by 
the israelis but denied that she benefitted from the arrangement 
i have never made an illegal dime in my life mrs pollard 
said 
once robust and healthy she is now frail and nearly doubled over 
from a number of maladies she suffers migraine headaches is 
reliant upon laxatives and no longer can see clearly 
mrs pollard said she has uncontrollable bleeding caused by an 
ovarian cyst that she suffers from a rare disorder which prevents 
her from properly digesting food that she has an irritated bowel 
and problems with her intestines that keep her from sitting up or 
standing up straight 
she is seeking a medical furlough so that physicians at yale 
university can treat her but she has been denied permission her 
condition has caused many in israel and the united states to 
petition government officials to release her for treatment outside 
the prison system 
as far as the legal processes are concerned i can vindicate 
myself in a court of law im not worried about that that can come 
up in the future im worried about my medical condition im 28 
years old id like to function like a normal 28yearold these are 
problems which can be treated and have gone untreated she said 
paul lefebvre the camps administrator said mrs pollard is 
receiving proper medical treatment 
we have adequate resources to deal with her medical needs he 
said 
the pollards were sentenced in washington dc in march 1987 
after both decided against a trial and agreed to a plea bargain 
my husband and i were forced to sign a plea agreement i would 
elaborate on that but i cant due to potential litigation she 
said 
the legal term is they wired me and my husband together 
mrs pollard said explaining she wasnt willing to sacrifice her 
husband to make a better deal for herself my husband is the most 
important thing in the world to me i wouldnt do anything to harm 
or hurt my husband

the air force unveiled its 
sinisterlooking b2 stealth bomber tuesday giving the world its 
first look at the grayandblack flying wing designed to evade enemy 
radar and deliver nuclear weapons 
the bomber which has never been flown was towed slowly out of a 
hangar at air force plant 42 in the mojave desert to cheers from an 
invitationonly crowd of 2000 workers military brass media and 
industry representatives 
the b2 built primarily by northrop corp resembles a huge 
tailless manta ray with wide sweeping wings blending smoothly into 
rounded cockpit and engine housings on the top side 
the rollout ceremony conducted before a giant american flag was 
in part a celebration of us industrial ingenuity and in part a 
bit of hightech saber rattling 
gen larry d welch the air forces chief of staff said the 
planes declared ability to slip through radar at all altitudes to 
deliver its payload of nuclear bombs represents a potent deterrent 
to those who would attack the united states 
its stealth capability will permit it to penetrate the most 
sophisticated air defenses and survive well into the 21st century 
welch said the b2 is a superb example of the inherent 
technological advantage of free society 
the rollout followed by three weeks the pentagons release of a 
photo of another closely guarded project lockheed corps stealth 
fighter the f117a that plane has been flying since 1981 and was 
declared ready for wartime missions in 1983 its existence was 
acknowledged because the air force was preparing to start its first 
daylight flights 
nearly everything surrounding the stealth bomber is secret 
including the cost 
the general accounting office estimates the fleet of 132 stealth 
bombers the air force wants to assemble over the next several years 
could cost taxpayers 68 billion that would put them at more than 
500 million a copy 
the air force puts the total cost of the program at 30 billion 
to 40 billion 
the stealth gets its name from the claim that it will be 
extremely difficult to detect by enemy radar due to the extensive 
use of exotic composite materials some of which absorb rather than 
reflect radar waves its lack of sharp surface angles and a 
crosssection that offers a very small profile to radar 
the plane is a flying wing a design resurrected from the 
1940s that steers with flaps on the rear of the wings rather than 
with a tail the b2 displayed tuesday was gray on top and black 
beneath 
nobody was allowed to see the b2 from the rear presumably 
because revealing the design of its engine exhaust system might help 
enemy detection efforts 
air force secretary edward c pete aldridge jr told the 
gathering the programs expense represents an investment in safety 
let all of us remember americas enduring hope and prayer that 
the b2 will strengthen the cause of peace and that this magnificent 
aircraft will never be flown in anger aldridge said 
northrop chairman thomas v jones saluted employees of his 
company and of subcontractors who have worked on the project for a 
decade unable to describe their work 
for years theyve been working in a kind of honorable exile 
jones said they persevered and now you can see what its all 
been about 
the first flight on most airplanes is six to 12 weeks after 
rollout but air force officials refuse to commit to a date for the 
first flight of the b2 
one of the us senators at the ceremony pete wilson rcalif 
said budget contraints could force a stretch out of stealth 
bomber production although he noted that influential democrats like 
sen sam nunn dga give the program bipartisan backing 
sen james exon dneb said here today with the unveiling 
of the stealth bomber i have never felt better about the deterrence 
of america i think weve got a great airplane 
it has the potential to render obsolescent a very great 
investment in soviet air defenses wilson said 
as the bomber was towed out of a massive hanger an air force 
band broke into the stirring stealth fanfare composed for the 
occasion by tech sgt allen yankee 35 of mcminnville ore a 
saxophonist in the band 
the b2 project was launched by former president jimmy carter 
critics including the private union of concerned scientists say 
the b2 deployment planned for the early 1990s would hamper arms 
control efforts by posing a greater threat than current planes to 
enemy command posts and mobile missiles 
the b2 is described as an allaltitude penetration bomber as 
opposed to the b1 bomber which is designed to penetrate enemy air 
defenses at low altitudes 
the air force says the plane is 69 feet long about the length of 
an f16 fighter plane its wingspan at 172 feet is almost as wide 
as the aging b52 it is designed to replace 
flight tests will begin probably early next year at edwards 
air force base about 70 miles north of los angeles in the mojave 
desert the air force said the maiden flight will be the short hop 
from the plant at palmdale to edwards 
the bomber which has inspired intense curiosity among aviation 
buffs has already inspired models and a mockup appears in a 
current automobile commercial

the judge in the irancontra case agreed 
tuesday to consider oliver l norths objections to deleting 
sensitive references from classified documents prosecutors want to 
use as evidence 
us district judge gerhard a gesell scheduled closed hearings 
beginning nov 30 and continuing thereafter from daytoday as 
long as necessary to discuss the proposed deletions of references 
to sensitive matters including the names of countries foreign 
officials and us intelligence agents 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh has proposed deleting the 
references from the 350 documents he wants to use as evidence 
against the former presidential aide to protect us intelligence 
operations and relations with foreign countries 
an interagency task force that reviewed the material has agreed 
to allow walsh to use the documents as evidence in a public trial if 
the sensitive references are deleted 
gesell said north should be prepared to explain why a proposed 
redaction deletion is relevant and material for his defense to 
charges he conspired with former white house national security 
adviser john m poindexter and two arms dealers to illegally divert 
usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
the closed hearings will be held under provisions of the 
classified information procedures act or cipa which regulates the 
disclosure of secret documents as evidence in court 
the judges brief order made no mention of norths proposal to 
disclose the contents of some 40000 pages of classified material in 
3500 secret documents 
walsh has asked gesell to declare the list of documents north 
proposed as defense exhibits legally insufficient and bar him from 
introducing any of these papers into evidence 
the prosecutor contends that north proposed many of the documents 
as exhibits simply to provoke the government to drop the charges to 
stem disclosure of some of the nations most sensitive secrets 
at a hearing monday gesell seemed to signal that he would grant 
walshs motion saying intervening events make it wholly 
unnecessary to discuss any scheduling of in camera closed 
proceedings on norths cipa filing notice and therefore i have no 
intention of scheduling such hearings and thats a moot matter 
in his order scheduling hearings on the prosecution documents 
gesell said he had reviewed many of the papers walsh wants to use as 
evidence against north 
many of the deletions walsh proposes appear designed to excise 
the identity of countries mentioned and communications with named 
individuals including officials of such countries and united states 
agents in the field 
almost without exception north objects to these categories of 
redactions the judge said referring to a portion of the 
defenses secret filing on classified documents 
gesell directed walsh to devise alternative method to 
substituting the names of countries and individuals with letters or 
numbers the court finds upon examination of the papers that 
this masking technique appears unduly cumbersome and likely to 
prevent easy reading of the text 
the 350 documents walsh wants to use as evidence comprise between 
1000 and 2000 pages of classified material 
no date has been set for norths trial but gesell predicted at 
mondays hearing it could begin in late january 
at that proceeding gesell appealed to president reagan to decide 
whether he wanted the case to go to trial warning that he could 
have very little control over the testimony of current and 
former officials who will be questioned about covert operations 
poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and richard v secord 
are to be tried separately

populist leader benazir bhutto and her 
conservative rival met separately tuesday with pakistans president 
who is to decide which one will lead a new government 
ms bhuttos party took 93 seats in last weeks national assembly 
elections the rightwing islamic democratic alliance a coalition 
headed by nawaz sharif took 55 seats 
each leader claimed to have the backing of enough independent 
candidates and minor parties to form a majority in the 237seat 
legislature if named prime minister ms bhutto would be the first 
woman to lead an islamic nation 
ms bhutto declined comment after meeting president ghulam ishaq 
khan sharif told a press conference following his meeting that we 
will demonstrate our majority in a vote of the newly elected 
national assembly 
neither he nor ms bhutto have revealed specifics of how they 
would form a majority however 
sharif said he told ishaq khan to let a vote of the assembly 
determine the majority before a prime minister is named 
to nominate a prime minister simply because a group has more 
seats is unfair said sharif we want a natural majority rather 
than a contrived majority 
in a meeting monday with caretaker ministers ishaq khan said the 
transfer of power will occur in a matter of days according to 
the official news agency app wasim sajjad the caretaker justice 
minister announced the national assembly will convene dec 5 
pakistans constitution contains two clauses regarding the naming 
of a prime minister 
one gives the president discretion both in timing and selection 
of a cabinet leader the other intended to apply to elections after 
1990 requires the assembly to convene first then determine the 
prime minister through a majority vote 
ms bhutto contends the 1990 provision should be applied now 
because the polls scheduled for 1990 in effect were moved up to 1988 
but sajjads announcement suggests that whatever course ishaq 
khan takes the naming of a prime minister will occur after dec 5 
the full legislature will contain 237 seats 207 for moslems 10 
for nonmoslems and 20 exclusively for women the women will be 
elected by the assembly dec 5 
it means ms bhuttos party needs the votes of 26 more members 
for a simple majority compared with 64 more for sharifs group 
which includes loyalists of late president mohammed zia ulhaq 
zia died in an aug 17 plane crash only weeks after calling 
elections but on a nonparty basis ms bhuttos party took its 
case for partybased polls to the supreme court and won 
zia ousted ms bhuttos father prime minister zulfikar ali 
bhutto in a 1977 coup bhutto was hanged two years later after a 
court convicted him of conspiring to kill a political rival

a former security aide for political 
extremist lyndon h larouche jr told a federal jury on tuesday that 
larouches chief fundraiser ordered that loans to his organizations 
not be repaid 
in testimony that supported the heart of the governments case 
charles tate said fundraising chief william wertz told staffers 
there was no such thing as a loan 
tate said larouche fundraisers would try to have loans converted 
to contributions and if unsuccessful not repay them unless they 
was a political downside or threatened lawsuit 
in testimony backing another count against larouche tax fraud 
conspiracy tate testified the security staff performed maid and 
butler chores serving food cleaning larouches residences 
caring for his wifes dog and horses and handling grocery shopping 
larouche and six associates are accused in the us district 
court case of conspiracy and mail fraud allegedly for raising more 
than 30 million in loans with no intent of repaying them larouche 
also is charged with conspiracy to defraud the irs by filing no 
returns since 1979 while having all personal expenses paid from 
funds of various corporations he controls 
tate quoted wertz as saying the general population owed us the 
money and we had to get it from them 
who else said that asked assistant us attorney john 
markham 
mr larouche tate said of the threetime unsuccessful 
presidential candidate 
tate who quit the larouche staff after the alleged remarks about 
the loans in 1984 said wertz a defendant in the case envisioned 
himself as world war ii gen george patton 
wertz according to tate constantly exhorted larouche staffers 
to take the beachhead and capture the bridges and sometimes 
played the soundtrack of the movie patton starring george c 
scott 
earlier prosecution witnesses testified that they lent a 
larouche organization money for an antidrug book but never got 
their money back 
two witnesses elizabeth sexton 75 and lita witt 87 said they 
knew little aboutthe political maverick and his causes but wanted to 
make an investment in the book titled dope inc 
a third witness computer firm employee gerald lee corbin 
testified he was a contributor to larouche before and after making 
his loan 
but all three said they were solicited by larouche fundraisers 
repeatedly for their loans and often were promised they would be 
paid back with interest 
ms sexton said she was told by a larouche fundraiser that her 
money was safer with the larouche organization than with her bank 
because the banks are our enemies 
the defendants contest the charges saying they planned to repay 
the loans but were prevented from doing so when government and news 
media attacks on their operations forced them to divert money to 
defend themselves 
corbin of irvine calif testified that he lent 10000 in 
december 1985 to caucus distributors inc which prosecutors have 
described as a larouchecontrolled organization 
corbin said larouche fundraiser paul greenberg a defendant 
promised him 12 percent interest and agreed to repay the principal 
and interest within seven days of a request from corbin 
but corbin said that when he needed the money in january 1986 
for a down payment on some property he was unable to get it back 
and greenberg did not return some 30 phone calls 
it was never my intent for it to be a gift he said 
corbin acknowledged he had contributed to larouches political 
movement before making the loan and continued doing so right through 
this year when larouche made his third try for the presidency 
i wanted to keep on the good side of the larouche 
organization corbin said in explaining why he continued to make 
the contributions i still had hopes of getting my 10000 
ms witt who said she lent caucus distributors 10500 in 1985 
testified that her sole purpose was to invest in the book 
i didnt understand it was a political movement she said 
i was investing in their book i am not a supporter of larouche 
i have never been 
ms witt of dallas said she attempted repeatedly to get her 
money back but was unable to do so 
preceding ms witts testimony ms sexton said that in a 
desperate attempt to get back the 112800 she lent the larouche 
organization she wrote larouche himself and received a written 
response in may 1986 he talked about their plight she said 
i wanted him to talk about my plight i tried to explain my 
plight too 
larouche was indicted in october on 13 counts of mail fraud 
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the irs 
conviction on all counts could carry a prison term of 65 years and 
fines of 325 million 
the six other defendants face lesser sentences if convicted of 
the mail fraud and conspiracy charges 
the codefendants are wertz chief fundraiser chief larouche 
legal adviser edward spannaus and four fundraisers michael

the general assembly voted on tuesday for 
an end to colonialism by the 21st century with only the united 
states opposed and also condemned southafricas rule over 
southwest africa 
the resolution to declare 19902000 the international decade for 
the eradication of colonialism passed the general assembly by 135 
votes to one with 20 nations abstaining 
us ambassador patricia m byrne later explained that the united 
states voted no because it rejects the general assemblys claim 
to jurisdiction over the pacific trust territory also known as 
micronesia where america has military bases on guam 
article 83 of the un charter makes clear that jurisdiction 
over strategic areas lies exclusively with the security council 
and trusteeship council she said lashing out at these 
delegations that continue to bring their tired propaganda to the 
general assembly 
she did not name the delegations but the soviet bloc and 
socialist nations routinely denounce us military installations in 
the pacific and elsewhere 
a resolution castigating south africa for its 73year rule of 
neighboring southwest africa or namibia passed 1472 with 
seven abstentions britain joined america in voting against it 
south africa has been stripped of its general assembly vote since 
1974 for its policy of racial segregation called apartheid 
monitoring decolonization and trusteeship over territories that 
are not selfgoverning has been a major mission of the united 
nations since its founding 
when the united nations was established in 1945 750 million 
people lived in such territories dependent on colonial powers 
by 1985 more than 80 former colonies had gained independence and 
fewer than 3 million people lived in nonsovereign territories most 
of those could live in independent nations in the near future 
namibias 15 million residents and western saharas 117000 
people could gain self determination under two un independence 
plans in the works 
about 550000 residents of the former portuguese colony of east 
timor in the indonesian archipelago are unlikely to be independent 
soon indonesia invaded and seized east timor in august 1975 and 
has shown no inclination to give it up 
britain continues to keep its colony on the falkland islands 
saying its 1800 residents wish to remain british subjects 
the remaining territories held by britain and the united states 
are tiny islands with potential strategic significance 
britain and the united states submit annual reports to committees 
of the trusteeship council on social economic and educational 
progress in their possessions 
puerto rico was removed from the uns list of 
nonselfgoverning territories in 1952 when it adopted its present 
constitution and commonwealth status and relinquished its 
territorial status

a un antiapartheid group said tuesday it 
is investigating 48 alleged violations of a voluntary embargo on oil 
shipments to south africa aimed at undermining that countrys system 
of racial segregation 
it also said some world corporations have helped the pretoria 
government obtain oil although they are not covered by the embargo 
and are not violating national laws 
the second annual report by the un intergovernment group to 
monitor supply and shipping of oil to south africa said the vast 
majority of the worlds oil producing states prohibit exporting oil 
to south africa 
it called the embargo adopted by the general assembly in 1984 
an important means of pressuring south africa to dismantle 
apartheid because that nation is dependent on imported oil the 
embargo is voluntary and the world body has no enforcement powers 
however it said in a statement some transnationals like 
british petroleum caltex mobil shell and total have helped south 
africa obtain oil and british petroleum and shell are allegedly 
still involved in oil imports to that country 
in 1988 the report said the group received reports of 64 
alleged violations involving 32 ships sixteen cases were withdrawn 
and the remaining 48 cases are still under suspicion and our 
investigation it said without giving specifics 
the imposition of a mandatory oil embargo by the security 
council against south africa is urgently needed to complement the 
arms embargo imposed by the security council the report said 
it also noted there are a number of transnational corporations 
that have assisted south africa in its coal conversion to oil and 
hydrocarbon exploration projects 
when the threat of an oil embargo began to loom and the 
apartheid regime decided to expand its coal exports a new occasion 
of collaboration between the regime and international oil companies 
arose 
the oil companies are granted access to cheap coal in return 
for their cooperation in evading the oil embargo 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

thousands of people gathered in dealey plaza on 
tuesday bringing flowers silently praying and remembering the day 
25 years ago when president john f kennedy was killed as his 
limousine passed the grassy knoll 
we are here because this is an important place in dallas an 
important place in history what happened here 25 years ago said 
schoolteacher jean hill who was also at the site on nov 22 1963 
although this was a traumatic event i want them to feel they 
are a part of americas history said hill who brought about 50 
youngsters to the scene also i want my kids to know it does not 
take violence of any kind to bring about change and that they 
themselves can be instruments of change and it can be good 
dallas held no official ceremony to mark the anniversary of 
kennedys death at 1230 pm but 2500 people filled the downtown 
plaza where the president was shot as he waved to crowds from the 
back of an open limousine 
about 20 people clapsed hands in a loose chain along the 
motorcade route someone put a crucifix and two bouquets on elm 
street at the approximate point where kennedy was hit a note on one 
said we still miss you nov 22 another said after 25 
years we still love you john traffic backed up as cars pulled 
into different lanes on the oneway threelane street to avoid 
hitting the impromptu memorial 
alvin marin 52 said the cross he placed in the street was the 
same one he grasped upon hearing of kennedys death 25 years ago 
its just something to remember him by marin said this is 
very emotional 
a few knelt in prayer in the stone memorial to kennedy a few 
blocks away while others snapped pictures of the memorial and the 
texas school book depository building where police found lee harvey 
oswalds rifle 
members of the kennedy family observed the anniversary in mostly 
private services they have asked people to mark his birthday on may 
29 instead of his assassination 
jacqueline kennedy onassis attended a private mass in new york 
city along with her son john and daughter caroline sen edward 
m kennedy dmass laid a white rose on a monument honoring his 
brother in runnymede england 
eunice kennedy shriver the late presidents sister visited his 
grave and that of her brother robert at arlington national cemetery 
in virginia and said she hopes people remember the high points of 
his life the laughter and the vision 
while people walked in the plaza below reporters got a rare 
glimpse through the window on the sixth floor of the book depository 
building where oswald was believed to have fired the fatal shots 
that floor now in a county office building rarely has been 
opened it is being converted to a museum by the dallas county 
historical foundation and is expected to open feb 20 presidents 
day 
students from the university of texas at arlington explored 
assassination theories as they toured the dealey plaza landmarks 
when the warren commission report came out it just didnt set 
well said jim marrs who has taught the class jfk 
assassination conspiracy revealed since 1976 it became real 
apparent that all that could be said about it had not been said 
the interest is there everyone would like to know what really 
happened 
recollections also were shared at parkland memorial hospital 
where kennedy was treated and died the hospital sponsored a 
roundtable discussion among three doctors and two nurses who were 
involved in kennedys treatment 
it was as hopeless as anything we ever worked on said 
charles baxter who was directing the emergency room when kennedy 
was brought in the emotion in the room would have said to try and 
do something even though it was a hopeless situation 
after pronouncing kennedy dead baxter said the staff fell silent 
everybody knew it he said nobody had to say anything

negotiators for the chicago suntimes and its 
editorial employees reached tentative agreement on a threeyear 
contract tuesday without any of the pay concessions that had 
prompted a strike threat 
the unions executive committee unanimously recommended approval 
of the pact which includes a flat 500 payment in the first year 
and 3 percent raises in the remaining two years for the 
approximately 250 reporters editors and photographers who are 
members of the local 71 of the chicago newspaper guild 
a ratification vote was scheduled for nov 29 
it would have been unprecedented if we didnt get some type of 
remuneration for the first year said union spokesman dan lehmann 
who also is the suntimes religion writer it would have set a 
pattern for accords across this country that the guild simply could 
not let happen 
he declined to discuss other provisions of the proposed deal 
including such sticking points as an affirmative action plan and who 
is exempt from the contract 
i want our members to read the contract before they read 
anything about it he said 
suntimes spokesman michael soll said the newspapers management 
was pleased with the settlement 
we just want to get things back on track he said 
the union had set a strike deadline of 230 pm monday but 
postponed any action while negotiations continued throughout the 
day the last management proposal put to the union late monday 
offered a wage freeze for the first year followed by 3 percent 
raises in the next two years 
following a 2hour meeting union members voted to ask suntimes 
bargainers to return to the table and make some improvements 
i think that meeting made it clear that a substantial majority 
was willing to walk out if that was the companys final offer he 
said i think thats when the company sensed the seriousness of 
the situation 
the suntimes initial bargaining stance included a 15 percent 
pay cut over two years but that was modified to a 3 percent pay cut 
for 18 months followed by restoration of current pay for the 
balance of a threeyear pact 
the pay scale at the newspaper ranges from 625 a week for 
starting reporters to 895 for reporters with five years experience 
union members have been working without a contract since june 1 
a strike would have been the first by suntimes editorial workers in 
the newspapers 40year history 
the suntimes said it must control costs to remain competitive 
with the larger chicago tribune which has an estimated circulation 
of 765000 daily and 111 million sunday 
the suntimes whose circulation is estimated at 605000 daily 
and 614000 on sundays was purchased from rupert murdoch for 145 
million in june 1986 by a group of investors led by the new york 
investment firm adler amp shaykin

president reagan has no intention of 
taking action to stop the trial of former aide oliver m north on 
charges related to the irancontra affair a white house spokesman 
said tuesday 
one day after us district judge gerhard gesell said that reagan 
has the constitutional authority to stop the trial likely to begin 
in late january spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters that we 
dont have any direct role in the case 
north has been indicted on charges of conspiring with others to 
defraud the government in connection with a behindthescenes 
attempt to use proceeds from the sale of us arms to iran to assist 
the rebels fighting the sandinista regime in nicaragua 
i still think ollie north is a hero reagan said at one point 
last march while predicting that north and former national security 
adviser john m poindexter would be acquitted of the charges brought 
against them 
but more recently reagan and top white house aides have refused 
to discuss whether the president might grant a pardon to north with 
less than 60 days remaining in reagans term such a move would seem 
impossible in light of the presidents determination to see the 
trial proceed 
reagan when asked monday whether he was nearing a decision on a 
north pardon replied no no and i dont think it would be any 
time to make such a decision while its still before the courts 
earlier monday fitzwater had told reporters aboard air force one 
on the trip to california i maintain that no one knows what the 
presidents thinking on this is 
but when asked about this again tuesday the spokesman replied 
tersely we arent discussing pardons 
judge gesell had noted that if the trial proceeded it could 
result in the public release of a wide array of sensitive or 
classified government information the judge said he felt reagan 
should decide whether he wants to withhold certain documents likely 
to be used either by the prosecution or the defense in the case 
asked whether reagan felt he had any role in notifying the court 
of his views about evidence that might be used in court fitzwater 
said we dont have any direct role no 
our role at the moment is to work the courts in reviewing 
the classified information he said as judge gesell pointed out 
president reagan called for this investigation in the beginning 
we have said yesterday and on previous occasions that the 
presidents position on pardons was that he believes the legal 
process should be allowed to take its course and we are not 
discussing pardons 
fitzwater said that the white house in fact had been working 
to review classified information that has been designated by the 
prosecution and by the defense and we have declassified or 
reviewed and declined to declassify thousands of pages of 
documents that have been provided by both sides in the case and we 
will continue to do that 
fitzwater said he understood that the judge was merely reminding 
reagan of his constitutional authority to thwart the trial if he 
wished to do so but said that is not the presidents intention 
the spokesman also said that we have not asked for executive 
privilege to protect secrets at any point in this case it has not 
been an issue 
the problem is now on the defense side where the defense has 
introduced thousands of new documents that they believe are germane 
to the case that would have to be reviewed as well the spokesman 
said

former president chun doohwan 
apologized to the nation wednesday for human rights abuses and 
corruption under his harsh rule and said he was surrendering 
millions of dollars 
i am pained and ashamed of my past i have no intention at all 
to make an excuse chun said in a nationally televised 30minute 
address 
chun who said he was taking responsibility for all misdeeds 
under his rule ended by saying my dear people i am really 
sorry 
about 50 radical students armed with iron rods and firebombs 
tried to break through thousands of riot police around chuns house 
in seoul right after he spoke apparently to stop him from leaving 
but chun already had left for rural exile 
arrest chun doohwan the students shouted as police 
dispersed them 
chun told the nation he would not try to defend or explain his 
past actions and deeply regretted the abuses under his government 
many koreans have been demanding chun be arrested and tried for 
abuses and corruption during his sevenyear term that ended in 
february opposition groups staged violent protests as anger over 
chun mounted 
president roh taewoo another former general and associate of 
chun is trying to defuse the crisis without damaging his 
governments position 
chun left his home right after the speech to go into exile some 
place in the countryside 
yonhap the south korean news agency said chun and his wife were 
going to a buddhist monastery in the mountains east of seoul rural 
exile is a traditional korean form of atonement for disgraced 
officials 
roh must somehow satisfy public indignation against chun while 
distancing his government from past abuses 
some opposition groups have called for rohs resignation or 
overthrow contending the government is a front for military rule 
and part of the system erected by chun 
to atone the 57yearold chun said wednesday that he was 
surrendering all his personal property including his house and 
land about 33 million in cash and membership in two golf clubs 
chun also said he was returning about 20 million in surplus 
political funds left over at the end of his term he said he did not 
have any property or money hidden overseas even though he knew many 
people would not believe him 
chun a former general took power with military backing in 1980 
he has denied any personal corruption but about a dozen of his 
relatives and associates have been convicted or charged with 
embezzlement and other crimes 
he said wednesday he took responsibility for all wrongs committed 
under his government for all the misdeeds and mistakes committed 
in the seven years of office i am responsible because i was the man 
who held ultimate responsibility for state affairs he said 
chun specifically apologized for the forced dismissal of 
government officials and journalists when he took power the deaths 
of opposition supporters who were sent to harsh reeducation camps 
and corruption and embezzlement by relatives and associates 
he made a special apology for the bloody 1980 suppression of an 
uprising by students and citizens in the southern city of kwangju 
that left about 200 people dead he called it a tragedy 
he said in turning his property over in atonement i am now 
turning this over i hope this property and assets will be disposed 
of in accordance with the peoples wishes and desires 
this is all i have there is nothing hidden 
many observers doubted that chuns apology would defuse the 
public anger against the former president large numbers of koreans 
want chun punished for his harsh rule and demand a full legal 
accounting of his rule 
a national assembly committee probing the bloody military 
suppression of the kwangju uprising voted tuesday to subpoena chun 
to explain his role in the incident 
opposition lawmakers on the committee ignored pleas from 
government members to wait until chun made his statement to the 
nation wednesday before deciding whether to proceed with a subpoena 
the committee voted 1612 to subpoena chun with members of the 
governing democratic justice party voting against 
roh indicated he is considering pardoning chun after chun 
apologized according to south korean press reports but government 
officials indicate they will initiate a probe against chun if the 
apology fails to quiet public anger 
chun was a senior general and in effective control of the 
government when troops quashed the uprising by citizens and students 
in kwangju dissident groups claim up to 2000 people were killed 
assembly committee officials indicated chun would be summoned in 
early december he would face prosecution if he did not obey the 
subpoena

police arrested the leader of a 
militant transportation union on wednesday morning after he 
threatened to expand a strike by drivers of passenger jeeps 
authorities said 
deogracias espiritu secretary of a drivers association known as 
piston had threatened to broaden the walkout after president 
corazon aquino refused the groups demands for an immediate 
reduction in commodity prices or a freeze in fare reductions 
a relative said espiritu was arrested at his home before dawn 
wednesday gen alfredo lim manilas police chief confirmed the 
arrest and said espiritu would be charged with inciting to sedition 
espiritu was the second union leader arrested since piston which 
represents thousands of passenger jeep drivers launched a transport 
strike monday in manila and cebu piston president medardo roda was 
arrested monday and charged with inciting sedition 
passenger jeeps are the main form of land transport in the 
philippines 
brig gen alexander aguirre commander of the philippine 
constabularys capital command said he ordered the arrest of strike 
leaders who allegedly pressure other jeep drivers to join the 
walkout 
if we have ordered the arrest of striking drivers who harrass 
nonstriking drivers then we should also arrest the leaders since 
these drivers are just following orders aguirre said in a radio 
interview 
mrs aquino met tuesday with representatives of the transport 
industry and promised to set up a commission to study drivers 
complaints she said the commission would complete its study within 
30 days 
but she made no commitment to reduce commodity prices and 
rejected a demand to suspend a governmentordered reduction in 
passenger fares pending cuts in the price of auto parts 
drivers have said they are demanding cuts in commodity prices 
but so far have specified only reductions in auto parts 
later espiritu told reporters that drivers could not wait for 
the study and would expand their strike wednesday 
elementary and high schools in manila were closed wednesday in 
anticipation of the strike but police said traffic appeared normal 
during the morning rush hour 
espiritu said two other drivers associations would join the 
walkout but manila radio stations said they changed their minds and 
decided to work wednesday 
espiritu said drivers in angeles and the bicol region of 
southeastern luzon island would join the strike no reports emerged 
from those areas early wednesday 
in previous transport protests militants were successful in 
getting large numbers of drivers to join on the first day of a 
strike but participation dwindled afterward because many operators 
could not afford the loss of revenue

a threejudge panel ruled tuesday louisiana 
has failed to set up an acceptable integration plan for its colleges 
and universities and ordered that a special master put one together 
the panel earlier this year ruled the state had allowed 
unlawful segregation to persist in the schools despite a 1981 
consent decree that was to end racial bias 
tuesdays ruling dissolves the consent decree 
the court does not mean to preclude continuing settlement 
discussions thus the parties are welcome to submit a 
consensus plan said the order 
they bent over backward to let all parties work together 
said gov buddy roemer 
the judges scheduled a feb 15 trial unless an acceptable plan is 
presented to the court before then an acceptable plan likely will 
include a single board to govern all the schools the judges said 
the state currently supports three systems each with its own 
governing board which are controlled by a superregulatory agency 
known as the louisiana board of regents 
none of the four boards wants to relinquish authority 
they said one of the best reasons for a single board is a 
status conference like this one 14 lawyers instead of one the 
expense of what were doing now could have hired countless faculty 
members roemer said 
roemer said he expects the judges to appoint a special master in 
the next few days 
the panel consisted of judge john m wisdom of the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals and judges charles schwartz and veronica d 
wicker of the us district court 
the judges in august said that despite the slight increase in 
black enrollment statewide the racial polarization has increased as 
a whole during the term of the consent decree 
the judges found that of louisianas 20 institutions of higher 
education those originally established as black schools 
southern universitybaton rouge southernnew orleans 
southernshreveport and grambling remain predominantly black 
it said that with the exception of two community colleges 
louisiana was continuing to operate an unlawful dual system of 
public higher education 
the 1981 consent decree was intended to resolve a 1974 lawsuit 
the justice department filed against the state

the army plans to shoot missiles toward 
the space shuttle during a 1990 mission to test key technologies of 
the strategic defense initiative officials said 
the star wars experiment called starlab is designed to 
demonstrate that sensors can distinguish between a rocket and its 
exhaust plume and then point a laser and hit the missile lt col 
d voorhees told reporters on a tour of the army strategic defense 
command in huntsville monday 
the missiles will be designed to miss the shuttle by more than 
100 miles 
the strategic defense command will supply five fourstage rockets 
called starbirds to be launched toward the shuttle during a 
sevenday unclassified defense department mission scheduled for 
sept 10 1990 said voorhees chief of the starbird project office 
lowpower lasers aboard the shuttle will be trained on a flat 
3by6foot target card on the fourth stage of the starbird 
the shuttle will carry a crew of seven including two air force 
payload specialists already selected they will be trained at the 
marshall space flight center in huntsville 
the air force systems division is in charge of the mission 
others participating in addition to nasa and the army are the navy 
and the massachussetts institute of technology 
because it is the first time any object has been launched at the 
shuttle the army missiles must fly a trajectory designated by nasa 
and the army must prove that trajectory in a demonstration flight to 
insure safety voorhees said one static firing has been completed

the recently resigned head of soviet space 
research says his countrys maiden space shuttle launch had 
absolutely no scientific value and the us and soviet shuttle 
programs are in deep trouble economically 
roald z sagdeev who headed the soviet space research institute 
for 15 years said last weeks inaugural soviet shuttle flight 
like the 1981 flight of the first us shuttle was an 
outstanding technological achievement 
the shuttle however is technology of the 21st century why 
should we pay 20th century money for it 
my personal view is that american experience with the shuttle 
indicates that from the point of view of cost efficiency the 
shuttle is in deep trouble said sagdeev who has followed closely 
the us decisionmaking process on the shuttle and is a key science 
and arms control adviser to president mikhail s gorbachev

the judge in the irancontra case says 
president reagan should consider the various courses of action he 
may take to stop the trial of oliver l north to prevent national 
security secrets from being disclosed 
us district judge gerhard a gesell did not say that reagan 
should consider pardoning the four irancontra defendants but 
suggested other means by which the trial could be stopped 
he said that under the classified information procedures act 
reagan could declare that the danger of disclosing highly sensitive 
government secrets was so great that the charges must be dropped 
the president as the nations chief law enforcement officer could 
either directly order the case dropped or he could invoke secrecy 
laws to prevent disclosure of classified information which could 
have the same effect 
the constitution does not permit the court to take this 
testimony in secret as did the congress it must be public 
gesell said adding he would have very little control over the 
content of the testimony

the philippines has just gone through 
a nightmare of storms sinking ships communist rebels escaping 
captivity and foodstocks vanishing 
parts of the nightmare can be explained by bad luck including 
three tropical storms that killed more than 600 people in two weeks 
but some filipinos lay it at the door of president corazon 
aquinos government charging that it lacks organization resources 
efficiency to keep things in order and accountability 
it is not enough that the president sets the example the 
philippine daily inquirer newspaper said recently on the issue of 
accountability she should also find the strength and conviction 
to make examples of officials who do not measure up 
the most graphic example was the escape nov 12 of the alleged 
chief of the communist rebel army the military says romulo 
kintanar 41 and his wife gloria 38 were allowd to attend a 
birthday party for a former stockade commandant and they simply 
walked away 
the acting stockade commander maj benjamin landrito offered 
maintained that he was unaware kintanar and his wife were allowed to 
leave their cells because he was asleep in his office at the time 
it was not the first security problem at the stockade at camp 
crame which includes the headquarters of the philippine 
constabulary 
kintanars host lt col robelito comilang was suspended in 
october when a rightist army officer lt col francisco baula 
reportedly walked through three doors that were supposed to be 
locked climbed the stockade wall and was on his way when guards 
finally shot and killed him 
that followed an incident in june in which dozens of armed men 
tried to free former gov orlando dulay jailed in the 1986 deaths 
of several aquino supporters raiders failed to free dulay but made 
off with armory weapons 
mrs aquino has demanded a full investigation into kintanars 
escape three senior officers including landrito and comilang have 
been relieved and restricted to quarters but some filipinos are 
skeptical 
there has not been any real investigation much less real 
punishment of people concerned fumed sen ernesto maceda 
chairman of the senate defense committee there is a tendency to 
cover up in the spirit of comradeship they just cover up the 
incident to control the damage 
macedas doubts were based on the failure of previous 
investigations to fix responsibility punish those responsible and 
implement changes 
commissions failed to solve the assassination in september 1986 
of labor leader rolando olalia the killing in august 1987 of 
local governments secretary jaime ferrer and the slaying in 
september 1987 of leftist leader lean alejandro 
another commission organized after january 1987 killing of 13 
land reform protesters by soldiers guarding the presidential palace 
never established who gave the order to fire 
the senior officer on duty during the shooting brig gen ramon 
montano was furloughed as the capitals regional commander during 
the investigation but months later he was promoted to major 
general and given command of the philippine constabulary the 
countrys national police 
three separate commissions investigated the december 1987 
collision of the passenger ship dona paz with an oil tanker in 
which more than 3000 people are believed to have perished 
all three commissions found evidence of widespread inefficiency 
in the maritime industry including overloaded ships lack of 
adequate communications poorly trained crew and the absence of 
effective search and rescue procedures 
but commodore carlito cunanan who as coast guard commandant was 
responsible for maritime safety was promoted to navy commander 
after the dona paz disaster 
in october the dona marilyn another passenger ship owned by the 
same company sailed into typhoon ruby and sank with 500 people 
aboard about half of whom are still listed as missing and feared 
dead 
although the investigations into the second sinking have not been 
completed officials say they have found evidence of many of the 
same shortcomings which led to the dona paz disaster 
the country is one big dona marilyn sinking in the middle of a 
storm while the captain snores on top of a mahjong table wrote 
francisco tatad a frequent administration critic many heads 
should roll 
in september emil ong chairman of the national food authority 
was furloughed and then fired after two investigating committees 
found evidence of widespread incompetence 
the committees cited among other things the disappearance of 
350000 worth of rice which ong said sank on three barges the 
coast guard said it had no record of the sinking 
two days after ong was dismissed he was named presidential 
adviser for regional government affairs 
that prompted columnist luis beltran to joke in the 
progovernment evening star newspaper that going on leave had 
become a new civil service status in which incompetents are 
prepared for promotions

timothy daly says he could easily have followed 
in his sisters footsteps playing a cop on tv hes no cop but he 
does take over from tyne daly when his new cbs show almost 
grown moves into the old cagney amp lacey time period next week 
the onehour series which has a special twohour preview sunday 
is an ambitious multiera drama about one couple seen as 
teenagers as college students and as divorced adults the plan is 
that each episode will begin in the present then flash back to one 
of the other eras 
ive been offered a lot of television and im thankful for 
that i shouldnt sound snotty about it and i dont mean to be 
daly 32 said in an interview its just that theres a lot of 
stuff on tv that people were interested in having me do that to me 
was not acting 
i really wanted to do something unique because how many guys 
on television have pointed a gun and said freeze its like there 
are 85 guys on tv saying freeze any night of the week i dont 
want to do that of course my sister did it too she pointed a gun 
and said freeze but she was a woman that was the difference 
timothy daly starred in the 1982 sleeper hit film diner but 
has done his proudest work on the stage most recently in coastal 
disturbances off broadway 
in 1983 he costarred in the shortlived tv medical drama 
ryans four this time he may have a winner almost grown 
is one of the better offerings among the meager selection of good 
new shows this season 
although different in style and premise almost grown sounds 
like the cbs answer to abcs appeal to baby boomers 
thirtysomething the comparison bugs daly 
i think its a good and ambitious show but the only similarity 
i can see with thirtysomething is that its intelligent 
television he said 
i dont think its a babyboomer show i think this show can 
appeal to anyone who likes rock n roll which is ages like 10 to 
50 so thats quite a wide range 
the show plays to the fact that a lot of americans have now grown 
up with rock music and their passion for it can turn a golden oldie 
into a painfully evocative memory 
daly plays norman foley eve gordon plays girlfriendwifeexwife 
suzie 
the pilot flashes back to their meeting in high school when norm 
is a goodygoody and suzie is running around with the local hood 
by 1971 they are living together off campus hes a deejay on 
the university radio station she aspires to be a documentary 
filmmaker they consider marriage only after norms appalled parents 
offer to buy them a car if they will tie the knot 
by the 1980s norm and suzie have two children and a divorce 
suzie a technical filmmaker for a medical lab is about to marry an 
irritatingly welladjusted cosmetic surgeon who donates his skills 
to penniless victims of disasters at the wedding norm suddenly and 
without provocation hauls off and belts the groom then ensues a 
typical reallife fight between two guys who dont know what they 
are doing and are hoping not to hurt each other the flash of fists 
quickly dissolves into a flood of apologies 
i think the reason the characters are likable is because 
theyre flawed said daly theyre just struggling along like 
the rest of us theyre not holding themselves up as anything 
theyre just trying to get through they have these emotional 
responses to things that get them in trouble 
i look forward to seeing if we can make some good tv shows 
daly said if we cant i hope it dies a quick and painless death 
but if we can i can see doing it for a while

an effusion of postelection proposals to raise 
taxes has created an illusion that only presidentelect george bush 
and the american electorate are opposed 
the proposals have come from such diverse sources as former 
presidents the financial community the news media organized 
labor academics groups committed to social causes members of 
congress foreign interests and others 
the avowed concerns of all center on the belief that the federal 
budget cannot be balanced in the near future through economic growth 
alone but must have an assist from more austere tax policies 
the proposals including those of former presidents ford and 
carter have developed relentlessly in the two weeks since bush was 
elected president on a platform that included a promise of no income 
tax increase 
so great has been the outpouring that some conservative groups 
have begun reasserting their antitax increase philosophy 
summarizing an analysis issued this week stephen moore of the 
heritage foundation which was influential in the bush campaign 
stated the facts are on bushs side there is no reason for 
him to retreat from his pledge 
moore a heritage fellow in federal budgetary matters contends 
that if congress simply holds spending growth to a rate less than 4 
percent a year the deficit will be eliminated by 1993 without a tax 
increase 
among reasons for optimism moore said is that the flow of red 
ink already is subsiding from a peak of 220 billion in fiscal 1986 
to 148 billion in fiscal 1989 economic growth already is outpacing 
the deficit he said 
more important he said was evidence that the deficit as a share 
of total economic output is likely to fall to 29 percent of gross 
national product in 1989 from 63 percent in 1983 
in support of his argument moore said that federal taxes already 
are at recordhigh levels that new taxes mean higher spending 
rather than lower deficits and that a major tax hike would slow 
economic growth and threaten recession 
he said that taxes will consume 196 percent of gnp in 1990 a 
level reached in only five years of this century and that federal 
spending since 1948 has increased 158 for every dollar of tax 
increase 
the cleavage in views between those aggressively encouraging 
higher taxes and those vehemently opposed produces something of a 
comprehension gap for ordinary americans there is very little 
moderate ground or agreement 
speaking for the american agenda a bipartisan group they headed 
carter and ford said they saw no prospect whatever of a balanced 
budget by 1993 simply through spending cuts even though they 
searched assiduously for some hope 
bush on the other hand seems to have committed himself to 
follow through on his promise of no major tax increases presumably 
relying on the prospect of healthy economic growth eventually 
overwhelming the deficit 
convinced that such a scenario will unfold moore said members of 
the protax lobby have been consistently wrong in their 
predictions about the course of the economy during the reagan 
administration and will be wrong again 
in 1982 he said they argued reagans tax cuts would cause high 
inflation but inflation declined in 1983 they said deficits would 
force interest rates higher but rates fell sharply during the 1984 
presidential campgain they promised a recession unless taxes were 
raised but expansion continued 
most recently he added they insisted the federal debt would 
cause the loss of us business and jobs to foreign competitors but 
corporate profits and employment levels in the united states rose to 
alltime highs 
they seem completely unable to learn from their mistakes 
moore concludes bush should ignore them their advice is as bad 
now as it has been during the past eight years

jf powers became a writer because he 
couldnt find a decent job during the depression in the 52 years 
since hes published five books two of which were novels 
the first morte durban won the national book award in 
1963 the second wheat that springeth green has been nominated 
for the prize this year hes up against another previous winner in 
the fiction category don delillo white noise 1985 whose 
novel libra about lee harvey oswald and the assassination of 
president kennedy has been nominated 
the three other writers nominated in the fiction category for the 
prize to be announced nov 29 are pete dexter whose novel 
paris trout concerns the murder of a 14yearold black girl by a 
white man in a small georgia town just after world war ii mary 
mcgarry morris whose first novel vanished is about a couple who 
kidnap a toddler and embark on a fiveyear flight from justice and 
anne tyler for breathing lessons which concerns a longmarried 
couple and the detours they take on the way to the funeral of an old 
friend in pennsylvania 
wheat that springeth green is the story of a priest who 
balances his desire for a contemplative life against the daytoday 
chores of running a parish 
i dont write a lot powers said in an interview when i 
was first starting to write i didnt realize i would only have 
published five books by age 71 i didnt know how hard writing was 
going to be for me 
it all started when he was a 19yearold in chicago and couldnt 
get a good job after graduating from high school in 1936 
i couldnt get into college because i didnt have the money and 
i wasnt a particularly good student he recalled so i worked 
in bookstores and i read a lot i had the idea that maybe i could do 
something of that kind 
but it wasnt until 1943 that his first work a short story about 
jazz musicians called he dont plant cotton was published in 
accent magazine a literary quarterly put out by faculty members at 
the university of illinois 
in addition to his novels powers has published three collections 
of short fiction and has been a regular contributor to the new 
yorker and other magazines 
though most of his work has dealt with the lives of priests the 
author a widower with five grown children never wanted to enter 
the clergy 
i considered the priesthood as something i didnt want to do i 
didnt want the responsibility for other people i had enough to do 
with my own life said powers who teaches creative writing at st 
johns university in collegeville about 75 miles northwest of 
minneapolis 
a priest cant really cut loose with most people because theyd 
be shocked he has to act as if everybody he meets is doing a 
wonderful job he has to be all things to all men like a 
politician he is a politician 
powers however is no politician he calls things as he sees 
them using the catholic church as a background in his writing has 
provided a convenient path for getting his message across 
i think for me its a way of getting at what is important 
what all of us are doing here he said are we getting old so we 
can move to florida is that it 
i dont think so i want to believe as any animal does that 
when he dies theres going to be more that things will be better 
in wheat that springeth green powers speaks through joe 
hackett a track star who enters the priesthood in hopes of becoming 
a mystic and making a direct connection with god instead in 
situations ripe with comic satire father joe finds himself running 
a parish helping people with their problems and drinking a lot of 
alcohol 
ive been criticized for not putting my characters in really 
dramatic situations i dont want to do that i dont want to have 
the girl tied to the railroad tracks with the train coming and the 
mountie racing to the rescue id rather if i can suggest the same 
kind of terror in the little things he said 
im trying to give people fingerprints of their own and not 
just have biblical characters who represent greed beauty and 
sinfulness i want them to be people such as my readers might really 
be themselves

ralph macchio is the kind of person who prefers 
natural grass to artificial surface no wonder the actor chooses to 
live far away from hollywood 
im sort of locked away from it said macchio a resident of 
long island im somewhat turned off by all the handshaking you 
play the game everybody plays the game but it gets old fast i 
just choose to be away from it 
but macchio loves to act his latest film distant thunder 
gives him a chance to play opposite one of the best john lithgow 
when i work with an actor i will rent his previous films he 
said i saw the world according to garp he was incredible 
terms of endearment he worked five days on that film and he gets 
nominated for an academy award thats my kind of deal 
macchio a very younglooking 27 plays a high school senior in 
distant thunder lithgow plays his father a vietnam veteran who 
abandoned his infant son and now wants to reestablish a 
relationship 
its not a true story about one person but its based on a 
group of real events real veterans and their experiences its 1988 
and the war still goes on said the actor 
macchio had to research the part i met with a kid who was 18 
and hadnt seen his father for eight or nine years his father was a 
veteran i talked to him a decent amount of time he was very 
helpful 
and he tried to find motivation from his own father as well 
im very close to him and i tried to imagine if he wasnt there i 
remember him saying dont shorten up on the bat at little league 
i just imagined not having that 
fans may be most familiar with macchios starring roles in the 
karate kid and the karate kid ii boxoffice smashes that have 
grossed over 200 million and yes there will be a karate kid 
iii but macchio fulfilling a contractual obligation is 
approaching the film with mixed feelings 
im somewhat looking forward to it he said with a thin 
smile the people like it its a good story the first film 
really turned out nice i think we owe it to the public and it will 
be nice to complete the saga 
macchio was born and raised on long island he didnt do much 
acting as a youngster dancing was his first love 
when i was a little kid i liked gene kelly movies i took 
dancing lessons from 2 to 15 or 16 my parents read it was good for 
kids it helped in making the karate kid said the actor whose 
karate moves at times resembled dance steps 
in 1977 a local casting agent marie pastor saw him perform at 
a dance recital and encouraged him take up acting his first feature 
film was up the academy in 1980 but his real break came three 
years later with the outsiders 
macchio was a teenager when he read the se hinton novel and 
was desperate to get the part of johnny i remember thinking i 
need this he recalled 
he was turned down for the part but learned that francis ford 
coppola was directing and vowed to try again 
then there was no way i wasnt getting it macchio laughed 
i auditioned and i got the part coppola wanted me to read for 
some other parts and i said no i still love that movie its 
something special my first real role 
he followed with the karate kid teachers and 
crossroads in 1986 macchios career took a drastic change of 
pace when he starred opposite robert de niro in the broadway play 
cuba and his teddy bear 
when i first met de niro i was nervous as hell macchio 
said i wanted the part i wanted to do theater and i wanted to 
work with him but after the first two days you relax youre all 
actors trying to create reality through someones words 
having worked with an actor of de niros caliber macchio felt at 
ease around lithgow 
i wasnt intimidated by him hes what i describe as a 
shootfromthehip kind of guy when its time to do the work hes 
right in it when its time to take a break hes a lot of fun im 
the same way i think the scenes we have together are really 
strong 
for the future macchio would like to raise a family with his 
wife phyllis a nurse and continue to grow as an actor 
to try to be believable is the challenge of it its one of the 
few professions where you get to see the work he said

as children growing up in east los angeles the 
members of the rock band los lobos listened to their parents music 
the folk music of mexico as might be expected the effect was 
profound 
as soon as we were tall enough to get to the knob on the radio 
wed say hey no more of that stuff mom recalls drummer 
louie perez the knob would spin this is what were listening to 
rock n roll 
eventually the knob spun back as teenagers just out of high 
school perez and his friends recreated those traditional mexican 
songs for weddings dances and the like and then melded them with 
their second love rock to invent the sound that characterized 
their first three albums 
now after scoring a commercial hit with the soundtrack to the 
movie la bamba los lobos has come back again to their roots 
the bands new lp la pistola y el corazon the pistol and the 
heart is a rousing loving sampler of the traditional music of 
mexico 
weve always wanted to do something like this perez said in 
an interview before a concert at carnegie hall and the timing 
just seemed to be right 
some might doubt that last statement as perez acknowledged a 
lot of people ive talked to have said why do you want to do 
something like that now youd want to follow up the big hit 
wouldnt you 
and id say not really weve always stayed away from the 
predictable and the obvious sort of thing and for us this is a 
real artistic sort of step and thats sort of a reaction to the 
commercial success that we entertained last year its our way 
of responding to that in a constructive more responsible artistic 
way 
for the album and the 11city tour that followed the band used 
only traditional acoustic instruments violin accordion upright 
bass plus guitarron jarana hidalgarron and other relatively 
exotic instruments rarely heard or even heard of in this country 
they also purposely varied the song selection to give us 
audiences a taste of mexicos different regional styles veracruz 
huapango michoacan and so forth 
we wanted to expose music from mexico thats relatively unknown 
to most people kind of shatter the myth of mexican music as just 
mariachi music perez said 
there was one concession to the nonmexican market the album is 
short just over 25 minutes long because the band didnt want 
anybody who was unfamiliar with this music to get burned out 
the band members also had hoped to offer the album at a special 
low price but warner bros which otherwise was supportive and 
agreeable to the project perez said wouldnt go for it 
according to perez sales of the album in its first few weeks 
have been satisfying nearly 100000 copies the bands next step 
after recouping for the holidays will be to get back into the 
studio for another rock n roll album that should be out in late 
spring 
meanwhile the members of los lobos are having fun introducing 
norteamericanos to the music of their parents the music of their 
heritage 
thats pretty much what weve always set out to do do 
something that represents who we are our identity perez said 
in a way this record is showing some vulnerability and i think 
people appreciate that letting people know this is who we are this 
is what weve done and this is the music that got us going 
this is the stuff that was around my house when i was a little 
kid and you might be from minneapolis and maybe there was something 
else around when you were a little kid but maybe its worth it to 
check it out

a helicopter flying in the persian gulf last 
summer only wanted to shoot film for nbc news but a us destroyer 
almost blew it out of the sky when the crew failed to respond to 
repeated warnings 
news helicopters around the world are becoming more aggressive in 
their quest for the best pictures pilots and officials now are 
taking steps to avoid disaster to strike a balance between the 
first amendment and public safety 
following last mays 7million redondo beach pier fire near los 
angeles news pilot bob tur was criticized for fanning smoke and 
flames endangering firefighters and hampering radio communications 
with noise 
we can be a pain acknowledged tur who is currently 
appealing a 180day license suspension for an unrelated infraction 
but he denied he hovered too close and said that wasnt the real 
reason for his problems people sometimes dont want publicity 
but if the media didnt tell you who would 
more news choppers are buzzing the skies above big news events 
from earthquakes to chemical spills often its the only way 
television crews or newspaper photographers can grab pictures of a 
distant sea rescue or landslide before deadline 
not too long ago only the three major television stations in los 
angeles and the los angeles times used helicopters said mike 
dreesman whose helitac aviation currently flies for the associated 
press and other news organizations nowadays photographers from 
such publications as the national enquirer spend hours each week 
airborne 
we ask the news helicopters to back off and most of them are 
pretty polite about it said sgt brent carey of the police air 
support division others are pretty persistent they want to keep 
taking their pictures and at times it becomes an annoyance 
these days teamwork among helicopters begins to play a more 
important role and thats not the most common trait in such a 
competitive business 
theres no problem in and around a major event when pilots 
communicate said bob pettee who flies for knbctv the only 
problem is when somebody does something unexpected 
pettee said experienced news pilots can shoot a chemical spill 
without stirring up toxic gas stay far enough away from a hostage 
situation to avoid exciting a gunman and cooperate with other 
pilots on the scene 
sometimes they even help officials by tracking fires or flying 
out victims he said 
complaints were common before the federal aviation administration 
limited flights around disasters in 1985 the faas joann sloan 
said the restrictions allow local officials to ask the faa to 
declare fires crashes and other incidents offlimits to aircraft 
for safety reasons 
news aircraft are permitted only if they file a flight plan fly 
above rescue aircraft obey onsite authorities and follow other 
rules 
los angeles fire and law enforcement officials said they 
coordinate coverage with news helicopters as they show up on the 
scene 
i think the faa thinks they have things under control said 
ms sloan we havent had any disasters occur with these news 
helicopters that i know of anytime recently 
but last december jim burnett thenchairman of the national 
transportation safety board cited helicopter problems in asking the 
faa to tighten controls around disaster sites 
burnett cited six incidents since 1974 where news helicopters 
worsened hazards or hampered rescue efforts these included stirring 
up fumes and dust around spills of hazardous materials a fatal 
crash over a chemical fire and distracting ground rescue crews 
these incidents illustrate how nonrescue aircraft can 
interfere with rescue and cleanup activities and endanger the lives 
and health of the occupants of the aircraft the victims of the 
accident and the emergency response personnel responding to the 
fire or hazardous materials incident burnett wrote 
faa administrator t allan mcartor declined to issue new rules in 
march but he pledged the faa would impose a 180day license 
suspension for pilots ignoring flight restrictions 
tur knows all about such suspensions the pilot whose company 
sells videotape to several television stations ran into trouble 
with federal officials in march 1987 over the air national guard jet 
fighter crash that killed dean paul martin son of entertainer dean 
martin 
the faa honored a request by search officials to issue flight 
restrictions around the crash site in the san bernardino mountains 
east of los angeles according to testimony at a suspension hearing 
last september 
tur was warned away from the area by an air force colonel on the 
scene but he flew by to shoot late afternoon pictures of searchers 
combing the steep brushfilled mountainside for debris and bodies 
other news crews were escorted over the scene at a higher altitude 
tur contended that flights were restricted only to avoid 
publicity 
never can a local state or federal agency prevent news media 
representatives from flying into an area because public relations 
doesnt want the story told he said 
but col charles k cross the air force officer at the site 
testified news helicopters posed a safety threat he said turs 
noisy flight significantly disrupted my coordination efforts by 
distracting searchers and jeopardized their safety 
like tur the late leo galanis of denvers kusatv who was head 
of the national broadcast pilots association felt the martin crash 
site was restricted merely to curb publicity 
i think its obvious if it was not dean martins son there 
would not have been a restriction in effect galanis said in an 
interview a few weeks before his own death in a helicopter crash 
galanis and cameraman brian hostetler were returning from 
covering a plane crash oct 19 when their helicopter became 
entangled in a utility cable and crashed southwest of denver both 
men were killed 
blocking or limiting media helicopters galanis said in the 
interview prevents the public from seeing events that theyre 
entitled to see under the first amendment

emergency shelters house a growing throng of 
homeless americans but the need now in the words of a national 
academy of sciences study is for a stable residence for those 
who have none in other words permanent housing noting that 
federal funds for lowincome housing have been cut by more than 
threequarters since 1981 advocates say the need for lasting 
shelter is critical some see potential in unused governmentowned 
houses and in the shells of oncesturdy buildings that stand vacant 
in inner cities 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
taxpayers around the nation own tens of thousands of houses 
standing empty at the same time tens of thousands of american 
families with nowhere to live overflow shelters and haunt the 
streets 
now the homeless and some of the publicly owned vacant homes are 
being brought together in a project that is housing families from 
the minnesota cold in a clandestine effort to renovate and occupy a 
dwelling in chicago in new york citys restoration of entire 
tumbledown blocks 
activists while encouraged are pressing housing officials to do 
more and a major decision could come in federal court next week 
they say the government is skirting a law that pledges available 
space to those without homes 
i think thousands of buildings could and should be usable 
said robert hayes counsel for the national coalition for the 
homeless in new york a city that owns mostly through tax default 
5000 empty apartment buildings with many times that number of 
apartments and has an estimated 60000 homeless people 
one of the abandoned buildings was on leggett street in a sorry 
corner of the south bronx a national symbol of blight 
one of the homeless was susan thomas placed in a shabby welfare 
hotel room in manhattan a few years ago with her two sons then 6 
months and 2 years old after she split from their father and ended 
up on the street 
i used to cry cause i didnt want to be there she says 
their hotel room was broken into and drug dealing and fear were all 
around 
after 18 months she boarded a city van for leggett street to 
look at an apartment in a building that had been restored 
i wasnt expecting anything like this the 24yearold woman 
said talking to a reporter in her tidy bright twobedroom 
apartment her boys playing across a room thats still mostly bare 
of furnishings it was ms thomas day off shes a clerk in a 
nearby store 
her building whose tiled entrance foyer smelled of cleaning 
fluid had been a ruin not long before 
another bronx site still is but not for long workers there are 
gutting five buildings that occupy a whole block to create 220 
apartments for families like the thomases 
vince campisi construction supervisor outgrowled the demolition 
equipment as he described getting started you literally couldnt 
get in for the junkies crack vials by the garbagepailful 
leading a reporter on a tour campisi crunched up rubblestrewn 
steps to the remains of what a parlor its ceiling was burned 
through to the sky a green upholstered sofa stood upended in a 
corner the windows let in a drizzle no airconditioning 
needed he deadpanned 
still he and others said fixing up buildings that landlords have 
abandoned is often cheaper than new construction in places like new 
york the guttingandrehab job that campisi is overseeing is to 
cost the city 15 million how much would comparable new buildings 
cost maybe 50 million he guessed 
halfway across the country in minnesota the vacant publicly 
owned houses being readied for the homeless look different 
in duluth a threebedroom ranch house that had reverted to the 
department of housing and urban development when its owners failed 
to make payments on a federally backed loan is being readied for a 
family that has been on the streets 
were offering properties that are in good condition said 
patricia mack of the hud office in minneapolis which hopes by next 
spring to lease 15 houses rentfree to nonprofit groups that house 
the homeless 
such efforts have strong support according to a survey earlier 
this year by the national housing institute a nonprofit think tank 
based in orange nj one thousand adults were surveyed by phone 
eight in 10 favored rehabilitating old and vacant buildings for 
homeless americans who number 450000 to 3 million estimated by 
the government and advocacy groups respectively sixty percent said 
theyd willingly pay an extra 120 apiece in taxes each year to 
expand housing efforts 
the need for permanent housing cannot be met says a 
september report by the national coalition for the homeless without 
an increase in the federal budget for lowincome housing 7538 
billion this year down 77 percent from 1981s budget of 322 
billion

beyond dollar allocations however an enormous pool of unused 
federal property in the words of us district judge oliver 
gasch in washington is not even being considered for use by the 
homeless despite a yearold law requiring that surplus government 
property be made available for them 
gasch made that observation in issuing a preliminary injunction 
two months ago stopping hud the veterans administration and three 
other agencies from disposing of federal property that is eligible 
for use under the 1987 stewart b mckinney homeless assistance act 
to maria foscarinis a lawyer representing the national coalition 
in the suit it seemed very peculiar that agencies all over the 
united states when pressed to list unused or underused property 
found only 12 parcels and to date have turned over only four to 
groups aiding the homeless 
there are literally tens of thousands of pieces of property 
across the country we cant be watchdogs on every one thats why 
we need an aggressive order she said referring to hopes of a 
permanent injunction at a hearing before gasch on dec 5 
the winter is hard upon us the judge said noting the 
urgency of the case in a nov 18 hearing on a request for an 
updated complete list of underused property what the court is 
fundamentally interested in is to make some housing available 
for these people 
he added i know bureaucrats the thing youve got to do 
with bureaucrats is crack the whip and see to it that they do the 
job 
not included under the mckinney acts broad mandate are thousands 
of houses the federal government owns through default on mortgages 
that it guarantees 
nevertheless advocates sought in a separate lawsuit to stop the 
sales of those houses until they could be considered for use for the 
homeless they were turned down by gasch and an appeal is pending 
in fiscal 1988 hud sold 80164 of these foreclosed homes at an 
average price of 38000 
currently hud holds more than 45000 properties according to 
department spokesman rod hiduskey who noted that the sales revenue 
goes mainly into a fund that repays lender banks that hud has 
guaranteed against loss 
hud officials argue that the fund would be bankrupted by 1990 if 
sales were stopped 
there are federal programs that discount house prices for 
homelesshelp agencies like ms macks in minnesota and the 
agencys urban homesteading program hiduskey said 200 federally 
owned homes have been sold at 10 percent below market value under 
another program for the homeless 
advocates say its not enough 
homes have been disposed of with agency coffers in mind and 
not national housing goals asserted the report from the national 
coalition for the homeless by and large programs to divert parts 
of the inventory to aid the homeless are unpromoted and unused 
as a result some advocates have grown more militant 
michael marubio of the chicago coalition for the homeless said 
that group is secretly rehabilitating an abandoned hud apartment and 
will turn it over to a homeless family 
later on well have a housewarming party and well ask hud 
officials and anyone else who wants to come he said 
nor is the federal government the only public landlord of vacant 
housing 
according to checks by the associated press as many as 60000 
vacant or nearvacant dwellings may be in local government hands 
because of tax delinquency 
besides new york citys roughly 5000 empty and 4000 partly 
occupied buildings there are 6500 in philadelphia 3000 in 
detroit 1600 in washington dc and smaller numbers in boston 
denver miami and other cities say housing officials 
in chicagos cook county 41000 residential properties have been 
declared tax delinquent for more than five years according to 
barbara grau of the chicago rehab network a coalition of nonprofit 
developers 
if america put its mind to it said marubio we could house 
the homeless 
in the last three years the boston public facilities department 
has turned 12 abandoned buildings out of 100 into shelters for the 
homeless 
the purchase of 50 houses from the veterans administration is 
part of a 31 million philadelphia plan to provide 490 units of 
permanent housing for the homeless 
in new york city by 1993 every vacant cityowned building 
that can be rebuilt will be renovated already or in a program to 
rebuild said catie marshall of the city department of housing 
preservation and development 
in 1986 mayor edward koch announced a 10year housing plan 
costing more than 5 billion but that plan meant to produce 
housing for many income groups should be redrawn to direct more of 
the money toward the homeless says andrew scherer a lawyer 
representing an advocacy group housing justice campaign in a suit 
against koch 
even so the plans provision for rehabilitating old buildings 
instead of constructing new ones economically makes sense 
scherer said 
if those squeezed out of homes because of high prices and other 
factors are to be saved from the streets he said the vacant 
abandoned stock that the city has taken title to is the key

the boardedup house seems out of place among 
the neat terraces and welltended sidewalks where children walk 
unescorted from school 
the middleclass oxford circle neighborhood of brick and stone 
rowhouses is a good place to live neighbors boast no argument 
says dignity housing inc a nonprofit corporation that wants to 
repair the empty house and permit a homeless family to enjoy the 
neighborhoods calm and stability 
but the neighbors dont want the homeless problem on their 
doorstep they say the area realestate market is strong and the 
house could sell easily to someone who would have a personal stake 
in keeping it up 
the poor people they come and trash up the neighborhood 
said john shepherd a retiree who lives a few doors away it 
doesnt matter if theyre black or white 
its still uncertain who will prevail 
the house which was occupied until may 1986 when a family that 
had defaulted on its mortgage left was included in the dignity 
housing program by mistake when city council approved the purchase 
of 36 houses from the federal department of housing and urban 
development the resolution stated this house was in the west oak 
lane section several miles to the northwest 
city councilman jack kelly who represents the oxford circle 
section insists the house should be privately sold in june he won 
city council approval of a resolution ordering the house removed 
from the program 
thats why they have erasers on pencils he said 
but dignity housing officials contend the deal is final 
i say hurray that this mistake was made because we need to 
put a family in there said chris sprowal the groups executive 
director and president of the philadelphiabased national union of 
the homeless 
dignity housing has placed 28 homeless families far fewer than 
it had planned but expects to fill 50 houses by the end of the 
year sprowal said city agencies are helping 
kelly said city efforts should encourage more private developers 
to provide housing for the homeless in areas where neighbors want 
them especially in dilapidated blocks 
i have no problem with that he said i have real big 
problems when they start coming into stable neighborhoods 
edward a schwartz director of the city office of housing and 
community development said he understands the concern and feels 
proper screening is needed to ensure the homeless people can assume 
responsibility and that the neighborhoods wont turn against them 
but are we to say that we are now going to return to 
poorhouses schwartz said 
the idea is to try to rebuild neighborhoods said bill burke 
who founded the nonprofit modular development corp in 1984 with 
the idea of making prefabricated houses for use by the poor he 
sees philadelphias cityowned vacant lots schwartz counts 7210 
of them as ripe for building 
in addition schwartz said philadelphia owns 6576 vacant 
residential units of which 5283 are in singlefamily dwellings 
mostly rowhouses 
philadelphia has enough housing for its 16 million people 
according to a june report by cushing n dolbeare a 
washingtonbased consultant on housing and public policy but the 
city needs at least 447 million to stem the cycle of deterioration 
and abandonment she said 
city records show the costs of rehabilitating one group of nine 
properties for dignity housing averaged 28300 per unit but fixing 
up houses in the citys more abandoned neighborhoods could cost 
80000 or more per unit much more than the city usually can afford 
to spend per family schwartz said 
a great many units will have to be knocked down schwartz 
said were knocking down vacant houses at the rate of 1000 a 
year 
demolition has other drawbacks many of the houses reflect a lost 
elegance and prosperity and are considered part of the citys 
architectural heritage 
whenever houses must be destroyed schwartz said its going to 
be a very wrenching decision

in hushhush surroundings 
kennedy space center workers are readying the shuttle atlantis for 
launch on thursday with five astronauts and a defense department 
satellite set to spy on the soviet union 
the secrecy contrasts markedly with the discovery flight earlier 
this fall which was heavily publicized by nasa every step of the 
way as the nations return to space following the challenger 
disaster 
hundreds of thousands of spectators watched discovery take off 
and land but atlantis will be offlimits to the public personnel 
working on atlantis are cautioned not to talk about mission details 
with wives husbands friends unauthorized persons or especially 
reporters 
only those with special clearance are allowed to work around the 
payload which was transported to the launch pad in darkness and 
loaded in the shuttles cargo bay two weeks ago 
when the countdown starts the launch team will be in a control 
center secured against unauthorized entry or electronic 
eavesdropping on computers and radio transmissions 
the pentagon would like to keep the launch and entire flight a 
deep secret but realizing it cant do that with a program as 
visible as the shuttle it has agreed to release some information 
it has allowed nasa for instance to report the countdown will 
start monday and that launch of the second postchallenger shuttle 
flight will occur thursday between 632 am and 932 am est the 
precise time will be disclosed just nine minutes before liftoff 
sources report the launch is set for about 7 am 
once atlantis is safely in orbit there will be a brief statement 
reporting everything is fine then there will be a news blackout 
until nasa gives notice that the shuttle will land in 24 hours at 
edwards air force base in california the mission is expected to 
last three or four days 
the silence will be broken only if the astronauts experience a 
serious spacecraft problem 
the flight will be directed from another secure control center at 
nasas johnson space center in houston with certain military 
aspects controlled from an air force facility in sunnyvale calif 
communications between spacecraft and ground will be encrypted 
this will be the 27th shuttle flight and the third dedicated 
solely to military purposes both the earlier military flights were 
flown in 1985 the defense department claims the secrecy makes it 
more difficult for soviet satellites and spy ships sitting off cape 
canaveral to monitor the flight and learn its purpose 
critics contend such secrecy is unnecessary because the soviets 
with their intelligence capabilities undoubtedly already know a 
great deal about the upcoming mission and once atlantis satellite 
is in its own orbit they say the russians will be able to track it 
precisely and know exactly what it is doing 
indeed much already has leaked out and been published about the 
satellite sources report it is to circle the globe in an orbit that 
will fly over 80 percent of the soviet union there it will gather 
detailed radar images and other intelligence data much of it aimed 
at helping us intelligence officials verify soviet compliance with 
arms control treaties 
the sources say the satellite has an antenna that will spread out 
150 feet and that it cost about 500 million making it one of the 
most expensive satellites ever built 
the sources also report the five crew members will conduct 
several experiments aimed at defining mans role as a military 
observer in space with reconnaissance a high priority it is 
believed the astronauts will test a special optical device that 
resembles handheld binoculars 
the air force has been planning several experiments for upcoming 
shuttle flights to determine how useful astronauts can be for 
strategic reconnaissance surveillance of soviet naval forces and 
other operational military objectives 
the tests will be coordinated with ground exercises including 
troop maneuvers naval movements and ballistic missile launches the 
military is not disclosing which of the exercises will be conducted 
on the upcoming flight 
all five crew members are military officers navy cmdr robert l 
gibson is the commander air force lt col guy s gardner is the 
pilot and the mission specialists are air force col richard m 
mullane air force lt col jerry l ross and navy cmdr william m 
shepherd 
gibson mullane and ross flew on earlier shuttle missions 
during deployment of the satellite believed set for the second 
day mullane reportedly will manipulate the remote robot arm which 
is to lift the cargo out of the payload bay shepherd and ross 
reportedly will be suited up in the shuttle airlock prepared to 
make a spacewalk if there is a problem with the deployment 
gibson and gardner also will be busy checking out more than 200 
modifications made to the orbiter to improve safety and reliability 
as a result of the challenger explosion that killed the crew of 
seven on jan 28 1986 
these changes also were made to discovery which was launched 
sept 29 ending a 32month interruption in the program that 
followed challenger 
nasa and the astronauts who piloted discovery reported that 
except for a few minor problems the ship flew flawlessly

two of the five military men who 
will conduct space shuttle atlantis secret mission are rookie 
astronauts a sign of nasas renewed confidence after discoverys 
triumphant flight earlier this fall 
and because the flight is entirely classified the astronauts 
will see virtually none of the fanfare that greeted the first 
postchallenger crew few details about the mission are being made 
public the astronauts are restricted from talking about their 
plans and even the exact launch time will not be released until 
nine minutes prior to liftoff on dec 1 
recently the atlantis astronauts showed up for interviews with 
several reporters at the johnson space center wearing lone 
ranger style masks as a tongueincheek way of highlighting the 
secrecy 
astronauts on classified missions generally are offlimits to the 
media altogether but the military agreed to let the atlantis crew 
talk to a few reporters because there was so much interest 
surrounding the flight 
the astronauts said the black masks came in a press kit that 
included flash cards with joke answers that read yes no i dont 
know i cant tell you i can tell you but id have to kill you 
the mixture of veteran and rookie astronauts on the atlantis crew 
returns nasa to the policy it generally followed before the 
challenger disaster on jan 28 1986 for discovery with the future 
of the nations space effort hanging in the balance nasa chose to 
go with five experienced astronauts 
the atlantis commander is robert l hoot gibson who piloted 
a flight in 1984 and headed the crew of the last mission to fly 
before challenger 
gibson who is married to an astronaut dr rhea seddon said he 
doesnt expect any major problems flying the orbiter which has 
undergone many changes since the challenger tragedy 
discovery did an awful lot of trailblazing and the pathfinding 
for all these new modifications weve got to do and so they went 
through all of those and weve had a relatively easy time modifying 
atlantis the 42yearold gibson said 
still gibson is too experienced to expect perfection 
theres always going to be little annoyances litle glitches 
that youre going to encounter he said 
the other crew members include rookies guy s gardner an air 
force lieutenant colonel who has waited seven years to fly in space 
and william m shepherd a navy commander gardner 40 is the pilot 
and shepherd 39 is one of three mission specialists 
rounding out the crew are air force col richard mike 
mullane 43 and air force lt col jerry l ross 40 who each have 
made one shuttle flight 
mullane was a mission specialist on the maiden flight of 
discovery in 1984 and ross twice walked in space during his 1985 
flight on atlantis while demonstrating construction techniques for a 
space station 
shepherd who was selected as an astronaut in may 1984 said that 
after years of hearing other people talk about spaceflight hell be 
glad to experience it himself 
i get the impression that its something thats real hard to 
describe its pretty enjoyable pretty awesome and you just have to 
see it for yourself before you really understand it he said 
most of the contact that ive had with members of the crew and 
astronauts in our office say things like that 
shepherd who is single said his mother and his sister and her 
family are planning to be at cape canaveral fla to watch his 
first launch 
gibson who has a 12yearold daughter and 6yearold son said 
his family has gotten more comfortable with his job but still gets 
anxious his mother who is a pilot was so nervous at his first 
launch that she looked the other way during liftoff 
even though she was an aviator all those years it still 
bothered her enough that she didnt want to watch i think after a 
couple of minutes as we got higher off the ground i think she 
started to watch then he said 
his son paul thinks everybodys parents fly on shuttles 
hes not old enough to realize that not everybodys folks do 
this so he thinks when hes big hell fly space shuttles and hell 
take us to watch his space shuttles go 
all shuttle crew members are allowed to take personal mementos 
and cassettes of music into space shepherd said he is taking 
several items on his first flight but he doesnt want to say what 
they are because its a surprise for his family 
astronauts often take such things as pictures jewelry 
medallions and flags aboard for their relatives former schools and 
favorite organizations 
mullane who was born in wichita falls texas but considers 
albuquerque nm his hometown is taking along a dinosaur tooth 
the tooth part of the collection at the new mexico museum of 
natural history in albuquerque is from a meateating dinosaur 
common to the new mexico area about 68 million years ago said john 
arnold museum spokesman 
arnold said mullane is a fan of the museum and had asked 
officials there if they wanted him to take an artifact into space 
they happily provided the tooth which will be returned after its 
trip 
gardner a native of alexandria va will carry a key to the 
city and an athletic letter from george washington high school 
ross was born in crown point ind where his parents still live 
shepherd was born in oak ridge tenn and grew up in the 
washington dc area where his mother still lives 
gibson is taking along a baseball from the baseball hall of fame 
in cooperstown ny where he was born once in space all the 
astronauts will sign the ball and it later will be returned to the 
hall he said 
weve got a bunch of guys in the office who are real baseball 
fans and they are just sick that im going to have my name in the 
baseball hall of fame he said

the index has gained for eight consecutive days since nov 11

mexico hopes to begin cabinetlevel meetings 
on ways of relieving mexicos foreign debt even before george bush 
takes office sources close to presidentelect carlos salinas de 
gortaris transition team say 
mexicos 102 billion debt is an urgent priority for salinas who 
was to meet with the us presidentelect this afternoon in houston 
as salinas sees it mexico must resume economic growth and debt 
payments leave little money for development 
salinas believes discussions could begin soon after his sixyear 
term begins dec 1 because bush has already said he will retain 
current us treasury secretary nicholas brady in office the 
sources said monday night 
bush does not take office until jan 20 
salinas has never met bush and hopes their twohour luncheon 
meeting today will establish a personal bond and set a tone for 
usmexico relations for at least the next four years 
both bush and salinas are men with open minds who are willing 
to listen to the interests and concerns of others we have different 
problems and common interests said juan enriquez a top official 
of mexicos governing institutional revolutionary party 
salinas also wishes to begin discussions on commercial relations 
he fears protectionist sentiment in the united states would hurt 
mexicos effort to improve its economy via nonpetroleum exports 
said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
salinas also is concerned about mexican migration a result of a 
lack of jobs and development in his homeland he believes the 
tremendous current should be discussed and recognized openly so 
it can be both orderly and controlled the sources said 
some mexicans fear the united states may see drug trafficking as 
the main bilateral problem outgoing president miguel de la madrids 
six meetings with president reagan were marked by us demands 
often irritating to mexico that it do more to fight drug 
trafficking 
at their final meeting in february de la madrid said bluntly 
that the best way to fight the drugs was for citizens of the united 
states to stop using them but the us believes mexico could do 
more 
salinas plans to fight drug trafficking more energetically and is 
also concerned about the cash crop problem in some areas 
mexican campesinos can increase their income 10 or 20 times by 
growing marijuana 
the two governments have managed to work out temporary or partial 
solutions to many other problems including water contamination 
along the border 
the bushsalinas meeting represents a first positive step in 
identifying the issues that will occupy the agenda during their 
presidencies said a statement released monday night by salinas 
office 
the meetings agenda was to be flexible the statement said with 
its main goal to establish a personal basis for a fruitful and 
consistent relationship 
mexican foreign policy is often at odds with that of the united 
states especially in central america and mexicans feel us 
government officials do not understand their culture and politics 
well enough 
but salinas aides privately speak of a bush who likes mexico 
and knows the country and its culture and its problems bush has 
lived in the border state of texas for many years and his son is 
married to a mexican

hospital corporation of americas 
decision to sell to a senior managementled group will go before 
shareholders of the nations largest health care concern sometime in 
february officials say 
hcas board of directors monday agreed to sell the hospital 
management giant for 36 billion in cash and securities to tf 
investments inc a company formed by hca management and headed by 
hca chairman and chief executive officer thomas f frist jr 
the groups offer includes 43 in cash and 8 in securities for 
each of hcas 714 million common shares outstanding 
hca stock closed up 62 cents at 4662 a share monday on the 
new york stock exchange 
hca stockholders are scheduled to meet sometime in february 
company officials announced in a news release an exact date was not 
given 
frist could not be reached immediately for comment 
a special committee of outside directors had rejected the frist 
groups initial offer of 47 a share and rejected a 51 a share 
proposal on oct 17 the committee at that time indicated it would 
accept bids from other parties through friday although a number of 
industry analysts expressed skepticism the company would get a 
higher offer 
the boards approval was based in part upon the recommendation 
of a special committee of the board comprised of nine outside 
directors and the opinion of morgan stanley that as of nov 21 
1988 the consideration to be paid in the merger is fair to hca 
shareholders from a financial point of view officials said in 
mondays news release 
hca spokesman john van mol said he did not know whether any other 
offers were made by fridays deadline 
hca which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals nationwide set 
up the special committee to consider buyout offers after the initial 
proposal in midseptember 
the company sold 104 of its less profitable hospitals just over a 
year ago to a new employeeowned company healthtrust inc in a 
spinoff that netted almost 16 billion 
john hindelong a health care analyst for smith barney harris amp 
upham in new york said nov 14 that anyone who takes over hca might 
consider selling its interest in healthtrust but hindelong said 
healthtrust might be more valuable if held for a year while it pays 
off its own debt 
hca also could find buyers for other assets and divisions 
including hcas psychiatric company the management contracts its 
international hospital business or even little bits and pieces of 
hca hindelong said

it makes people more confident about the canadian dollar and the

the grocery stores in owensboro are abuzz 
with talk about pork rinds the favorite snack of presidentelect 
george bush 
we did see a slight increase in that department during the 
campaign said ted belcher spokesman for one local chain and 
ive heard people talking about them in the stores its kind of 
like jelly beans 
jelly beans of course are president reagans favorite snack 
owensboro grocers however say they have seen little change in 
porkrind sales this month 
months ago in the days when vice president bush was trying to 
establish a more macho image for his presidential campaign his 
staff let it be known that his favorite snack food is pork rinds 
pork what many city dwellers asked 
pork rinds as in fried pig skin thats right the fried hide of 
a hog 
until bushs campaign pork rinds were virtually ignored by the 
media but the industry is expected to reach the 200 million sales 
mark this year the snack food association in alexandria va a 
washington suburb said final figures for 1988 wont be in until 
june 1989 
in 1987 americans gobbled 195 million worth of the skins 
compared with 186 million in 1986 and 184 million in 1985 
its too soon to tell if the bush publicity is translating into 
increased sales said a spokeswoman for the snack food 
association but sales have been climbing steadily without the 
publicity 
john rudolph president of rudolph foods co in lima ohio said 
his company which specializes in pork rinds and cracklings and 
controls 35 percent of the national market for those products has 
received a lot of publicity 
but were busy as the dickens already we work 24 hours a day 
seven days a week rudolph said 
and rudolph said he cant tell if all the porkrind publicity is 
translating into sales 
but it cant hurt he said pork rinds have always been a 
working mans product its unusual to have them associated with the 
president

the united states and the european 
economic community moved closer to a titfortat trade war tuesday 
over eec plans to ban imports of meat treated with growthboosting 
hormones as of jan 1 
at a meeting here us officials rejected eec compromise 
proposals to reduce the bans effect while eec foreign ministers 
stuck by the ban for health reasons 
the proposed ban affects 145 million of us meat exports a year 
to the eec according to us figures 
the united states has drafted a list of eec imports of roughly 
the same value which are to be taxed in retaliation for the ban 
us officials also have threatened to halt imports of eec meat said 
to contain hormones which they say indicates the eec ban is being 
violated in the 12nation community itself 
the eec is asking the general agreement on tariffs and trade to 
rule the planned retaliatory measures illegal the eec foreign 
ministers said in a statement that the retaliation washington 
considers would be a violation of the gatt rules on free trade 
in talks last week with us trade representative clayton 
yeutter the eec offered to exempt from its ban meat used for pet 
food coupled with a rise in imports of topquality us beef 
alfred kingon the us envoy to the eec said the united states 
accepted the offer on pet food but was not willing to move on 
highquality beef which would still have to be free of hormones 
the foreign ministers asked the eec commission to continue to try 
and reach a solution but willy de clercq the eecs external 
relations commissioner told reporters i am not very optimistic 
de clercq opposes delaying implementation of the ban which he 
said is not discriminatory as it applies to all meat imports 
one source quoted him as telling the ministers the united 
states has blocked any progress though we tried to get a 
compromise 
britain the netherlands west germany and denmark urged the eec 
commission to do its utmost to prevent a trade war said the 
source 
the two sides will meet twice before the dec 5 start of a 
gathering of officials from the 96 gatt nations in montreal next 
month officials said 
a british proposal to delay the hormone ban for six months to 
enable the new us administration to deal with the issue was 
rejected 
the eec first decided to ban hormones in meat at the beginning of 
1988 the bans implementation was delayed in the hope a compromise 
solution could be found with the united states 
the eec adopted its blanket ban on hormones in meat for health 
reasons the united states bans the use of some not all hormones 
and says this poses no health hazard to consumers

irans oil minister suggested today that a 
breakthrough was possible in opecs effort to reach an oil 
production agreement and crude oil prices soared more than a 1 a 
barrel on the news 
i think we can reach an agreement gholamreza aghazadeh said 
between private talks with other opec ministers 
aghazadehs comment was in stark contrast to irans earlier open 
refusal to allow rival iraq oil quota parity which has been one of 
the chief stumbling blocks to an accord among all cartel members 
on the new york mercantile exchange the january contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude stood at 
1399 a barrel shortly after 11 am est up 101 from mondays 
close 
venezuelan indonesian nigerian and algerian ministers were 
meeting separately with representatives from the formerly warring 
gulf states to try to reach agreement before wednesday 
iran had previously threatened to increase its oil production if 
there is no agreement the iranian oil minister told reporters 
monday the country is pumping well above the production quota set by 
the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the cartel is trying at its winter meeting which officially 
began monday to work out a new accord to restrain a production glut 
that has sent prices downward 
iraq is insisting it get the same quota as iran and refused to 
join the quota system now in effect because of this demand iran 
wants to retain its ranking as the no2 opec producer after saudi 
arabia 
the saudi oil giant which produces a quarter of the cartels 
oil says it will not join a new quota system unless all 13 nations 
take part 
everybody has indicated a willingness to be integrated into a 
production pact but to what extent they will cooperate now is 
unclear said a senior delegate who demanded anonymity 
a member of a key delegation said aghazadeh has suggested 
ministers rework a proposal recommending opec boost its official 
output ceiling which now excludes iraq from about 15 million 
barrels a day to a minimum of 174 million barrels 
the higher ceiling would make room for iraq allotting it the 
same share of 24 million barrels a day now held by iran iraqs 
current cap is 15 million barrels a day 
aghazadeh according to the senior delegate suggested that 
rather than giving the same quota to iraq the cartel divide the 
additional production between iran and iraq both want more money to 
help rebuild their wardamaged economies 
that would give iran a quota of about 29 million barrels and 
iraq presumably about 2 million 
that scenario apparently rejected by other ministers shows 
aghazadehs unwillingness to give in 
he told reporters monday that iran could boost oil production to 
more than 4 million barrels a day within a year 
he said the country currently is pumping more than 3 million 
barrels a day 
analysts however have estimated irans production at 23 
million to 25 million barrels 
they estimate iraq is producing at least 26 million barrels a 
day an amount that could reach 37 million barrels in mid1989 when 
a new pipeline through saudi arabia to the red sea is completed

south african companies are expanding abroad as 
disinvestment sanctions and the threat of future turmoil slows 
their countrys economic growth 
the united states japan france and denmark have imposed 
sanctions ranging from trade embargoes to refusing to extend loans 
and many foreign corporations have sold off their south african 
interests 
south african companies looking to expand or move outside the 
country may be particularly attracted to britain because of prime 
minister margaret thatchers steadfast opposition to sanctions 
but if the case of mining giant minorco sa is any indication 
south african companies that make publicly disclosed offers are 
likely to face growing resistance from the courts and regulators as 
well as antiapartheid campaigners 
the british government has delayed the firms 47 billion bid 
for consolidated gold fields plc pending a monopoly review other 
countries have also thrown up roadblocks 
south african companies are nonetheless intent on protecting 
their financial interests they can see day in and day out that 
the turmoil of what they describe as the worst kind comes closer and 
closer said brian bolton an englandbased writer on south 
african topics who supports the antiapartheid movement 
at some stage they have to act bolton said what that 
means at some point is putting up the shutters and hoping they have 
put away enough overseas to keep them in the style to which they are 
accustomed 
south africas rembrandt group ltd a major tobacco and consumer 
products company controlled by the wealthy rupert family elected in 
september to spin off its richemont group of nonsouth african 
interests 
richemont has listed its shares on swiss stock exchanges and it 
has no operational ties to south africa but still is effectively 
controlled by the ruperts 
the ruperts say they want to establish a presence in europe 
before 1992 when the european economic community becomes a single 
barrierfree trading bloc 
in a telephone interview jan du plessis richemonts finance 
director in zug switzerland also cited south african government 
restrictions which made it difficult to raise funds publicly as 
well as the impracticality of having headquarters far away in south 
africa 
other south african companies setting up footholds abroad include 
liberty life association of africa ltd an insurance group 
which recently set up first international trust in europe 
fsi corporation ltd an industrial group that holds aaf 
investment corp in london 
malbak ltds abercom which recently bid for my holdings plc a 
british sporting goods and games manufacturer 
unlike some smaller deals minorcos bid has attracted unusual 
attention because it would link two of the worlds largest gold 
mining groups in what would be the largest ever takeover in britain 
minorco is a luxembourgbased investment company controlled by 
the wealthy south african oppenheimer familys anglo american gold 
and de beers diamond mining interests it describes its hostile bid 
for consolidated gold fields as part of a strategy to become a 
worldwide natural resources group with direct operating control of 
its activities 
but aside from raising monopoly questions the bid has sparked a 
row over the extension of south african control to gold production 
in the united states and the pacific region 
nearly 45 percent of the noncommunist worlds gold production of 
13617 metric tons in 1987 was mined in south africa according to 
shearson lehman hutton securities in london 
minorco is now 60 percent owned by anglo american corp and de 
beers consolidated mines ltd although that would drop to 41 percent 
after the takeover with shareholders owning the remainder analysts 
say even a 41 percent holding assures anglo american and de beers 
effective control 
minorco says that if the bid succeeds it would sell consolidated 
gold fields south african interests namely its 38 percent stake in 
gold fields south africa which accounts for 15 percent of the 
targets pretax profits consolidated gold fields also controls

although asahi breweries says dry beer is still 
the biggest thing since the hop the competition believes japan may 
now be ready for the next step in specialty brews postdry 
yoshiki koga a spokesman for sapporo breweries battling asahi 
for second place in domestic beer sales said his company is now 
marketing postdry beers aimed at even more discriminating 
tastes 
dry beer has taken a certain share of the market but ive 
heard rumors that as a fad it has reached its limit koga said 
and to give beer drinkers a more diverse market sapporo has 
introduced rocks and the winters tale 
rocks which went on sale in march has 9 percent alcohol 
content double the usual and is for those as the name suggests 
who want to drink their beer with ice cubes 
the winters tale which takes its name from the title of one of 
shakespeares late plays went on sale in the tokyo area in november 
and is to be sold only during the winter 
koga admitted the new products were influenced by asahis success 
with dry and said sapporo was hoping to spark a similar hit 
the nations leading brewer kirin on nov 16 introduced half 
and half a mixture of light and dark beers in some urban areas 
we didnt plan it as a rival for dry said keisuke suzuki a 
kirin spokesman but the dry phenomenon does seem to be slowing 
down and many people are awaiting something new 
kirin which sells half of all the beer in japan began marketing 
its own dry brew earlier this year and now has 30 percent of that 
market suzuki said 
he said that in 1987 14 billion gallons of beer were consumed 
here making japan the worlds fourthlargest market after the 
united states west germany and england 
brewers hadnt tried to change the taste of beer much until we 
came up with the idea of producing something with a crisper taste 
asahi spokesman ryuji amada said 
the dry brew is higher in alcohol content and has less sugar than 
regular beer a prescription that according to amada was just 
what consumers were after 
there has never been anything like dry gloated amada whose 
company controls about half the growing market for dry beer 
since we first introduced dry beer in march last year our 
overall sales have gone from 10 to 20 percent of the total beer 
market 
the kirin sapporo and suntory breweries followed asahi with 
their own versions of dry but remain far behind asahi 
amada said sales of dry now make up about onethird of all 
beer sales in japan and we think that could go as high as 50 
percent next year 
dry has even begun penetrating the us market he said and 
along with japanese imports in hawaii california and new york 
anheuserbusch is brewing michelob dry for nationwide distribution 
dry beer was so successful that dry burgers they are 
spicier not less moist assaulted the japanese diet 
but the dry fad seems to have peaked last summer according 
to a spokesman for first kitchen a nationwide fastfood chain that 
put dry hamburgers on its menu in june with mexican spices 
setting them apart from other burgers 
the dry hamburgers were popular but weve decided to 
discontinue sales by the end of november he said requesting 
anonymity 
even so asahi is not about to give up on a good thing and scoffs 
at the challengers products 
it wont be easy to beat dry said amada the products 
going on the market arent really new and it was specialty beers 
that dry ate up to begin with 
he said we dont think dry is the best possible beer but we 
do think it still has a long way to go in the market and arent 
contemplating a followup product just yet

skiers will skitter down snowy slopes across the 
land this holiday weekend as many resorts open their seasons but 
industry executives say they are facing anxious times 
an aging baby boom population and increasing labor and insurance 
costs are squeezing the resorts and operators are reaching out to 
new markets like families to try to stabilize the business 
since the late 1960s and 1970s the number of ski areas has 
declined from 1400 to about 600 said jerry jones executive vice 
president of the vail colo ski operation which this year became 
the largest ski resort in the country 
the number skiers grew at doubledigit rates during the 1970s 
but the rate has slowed sharply since then 
in the past five years in just colorado a half dozen resorts 
have gone out of business and up to half of the 28 ski areas 
remaining are thought to be struggling financially 
the smaller resorts especially have some problems big 
problems jones said 
the national ski area association has launched a major study it 
hopes will foster a national campaign to attract skiers similar to 
generic ads that promote the coffee industry or dairy products 
kathe dillmann at the association said the business is just 
maturing after two decades of rapid growth and said no one expected 
the industry to keep up its doubledigit growth rate 
this is a business she said this cycle is not the boom 
cycle now but that doesnt mean its not healthy all businesses go 
through that we have to look for our niche and see what the market 
is going to do 
one of the biggest problems facing the industry is attracting new 
skiers 
in the 1960s and 1970s the baby boomers grew with the 
industry jones said then the women started dropping out when 
they reached their 30s and the men started dropping out when they 
reached their 40s you just cant invent 17yearold kids 
as a result ski areas have changed their emphasis to be more 
familyoriented they provide child care ski programs for 
youngsters and other winterrelated activities such as sleigh rides 
and ice skating in addition to restaurants and other amenities for 
the nonskier 
jones says there also is a trend toward specialized ski resorts 
resembling theme parks 
you can already see this happening he said offering several 
examples from his home state steamboat springs is a western ski 
resort vail is a bavarian theme resort aspen is a victorian theme 
resort i think youll see more specialization such as a resort for 
the elderly or for beginners only 
a religious ski resort even has been tried offering an 
alcoholfree environment and church services after skiing however 
the resort says it may close because of financial problems 
stephanie nora of colorado ski country usa which represents the 
28 resorts in colorado said many resorts are offering innovative 
pricing to lure skiers selling advance tickets through grocery 
stores and convenience stories multiday packages and other options 
its like taking a flight no one calls up the day before going 
on a trip and says they want to pay fullprice they call up a few 
days before and say they want a discount she said thats what 
ski areas are doing 
jones said the loss of the smaller resorts is hurting the 
industry vail recently leased the broadmoor ski area near colorado 
springs when the city had trouble making it financially 
were losing our farmteam organization he said these 
smaller ski areas in iowa michigan illinois idaho and so on are 
closing their doors and eliminating the opportunities for the 
potential new skier to enter the sport no one is going to go from 
tulsa to aspen for their first time skiing 
he said larger resorts have a responsibility to the smaller 
resorts to ensure they survive to do so he said they will have to 
create megaresorts that encompass several ski areas such as the 
complexes around vail and aspen in colorado salt lake city in utah 
and tahoe on the californianevada border 
the smaller resorts that are isolated probably will go out of 
business jones said the shakeout has already begun with up to 25 
percent of the ski resorts in the united states being offered for 
sale he said 
i dont think there are that many buyers he said the 
japanese have been all around colorado utah and canada looking for 
ski areas to purchase but these are the longterm survivors theyre 
looking at 
dr charles goeldner an assistant dean at the university of 
colorado in boulder who specializes in ski economics is more upbeat 
than the operators 
he says the market is much healthier than it looks noting that 
the number of skiers is still at an alltime high even though the 
rate of growth has slowed he also notes an echo of the baby boom is 
beginning to emerge with 4 million births a year creating a host of 
new potential customers 
the resources are finite and there are only so many 
mountains goeldner said look at europe and how high prices are 
there they make our skiing look like a bargain fifty years down 
the road our prices will mirror europe

the reagan administration in its last economic 
forecast issued an optimistic outlook today predicting that the 
economy will grow at a robust 35 percent annual rate next year 
the prediction for growth in the gross national product which 
measures the total output of goods and services is 13 percentage 
points higher than the consensus view of many private economists 
many private analysts are looking for growth to be very sluggish 
next year with the gnp expanding at a rate of 22 percent 
if the private forecasts are correct and the administration is 
wrong it would mean that the budget headaches facing 
presidentelect george bush will worsen in his first year in office 
he will be forced to trim even more from government programs in 
order to make up for less revenue from slower economic activity 
however beryl sprinkel chairman of president reagans council 
of economic advisers defended the forecast which will provide the 
basis for formulating reagans last budget submission to congress in 
early january 
i dont want to be accused of making the final forecast of the 
reagan presidency too rosy sprinkel said 
he said that the drought had held back growth in 1988 but with 
its effects no longer being felt on farm production growth will 
look better in 1989 
however sprinkel conceded that many private forecasters had 
taken these factors into account in making their much lower 
estimates 
blue chip economic indicators which surveys 51 top economists 
each month puts the consensus forecast for gnp growth next year at 
22 percent the administration projects that growth for 1988 will 
come in at 26 percent when measured from the fourth quarter of 
1987 
in other predictions the administration forecast that 
inflationary pressures will abate next year and the consumer price 
index will climb by just 37 percent down from an expected 43 
percent rise this year by contrast many private forecasters expect 
inflation to worsen next year rising above 5 percent 
the administration was also optimistic on interest rates 
expecting threemonth treasury bills which on monday shot up to 
their highest levels in more than three years to begin coming down 
in 1989 averaging 63 percent for the year 
the administrations interest forecasts play a key role in 
determining projections on how much the government will have to pay 
to 
finance the 26 trillion national debt now the third biggest 
spending category in the budget behind defense and the department of 
health and human services 
the new forecast represents a downward revision in expectations 
for growth in 1988 and a boost in the 1989 growth projections when 
compared to the administrations last outlook published in august 
in august the administration predicted growth for this year 
would average 3 percent while 1989 growth would be 33 percent 
sprinkel said the severe drought had caused this expectation to 
be reduced to 26 percent for 1988 but had allowed better farm 
revenues next year would boost growth to 35 percent 
the administration forecast foresees no recession in sight 
through 1994 an expectation considered far too optimistic by 
private analysts who note that the current expansion is celebrating 
its sixth anniversary this month the longest in peacetime history 
but sprinkel insisted that recoveries do not die of old age but 
rather by bad economic policies pursued by the government 
it is our good fortune that we have avoided bad policies 
which cause a recession he said 
the new economic forecast will be used in projecting the budget 
deficit for the 1990 fiscal year which begins next oct 1 two 
weeks ago the administration said that the impact of the drought 
had forced an upward revision in the deficit estimate to 132 
billion 
while that figure is likely to change slightly based on the 
revised economic assumptions sprinkel said he did not know what 
impact the new numbers would have 
sprinkel said the administrations economic expectations were 
based on a belief that the countrys trade deficit would continue to 
make substantial improvements next year triggering continued strong 
business investment by companies expanding production facilities to 
meet higher export demand 
but many private economists believe the administration is being 
far too optimistic 
david wyss chief financial economist with data resources inc 
said he expected gnp growth next year of 25 percent 
we are not looking for a recession next year but we dont have 
the same rosy scenario that the administration does wyss said 
the administration has often been attacked for basing its 
assumptions about budget deficits on socalled rosy scenarios 
about how the economy would perform only to see the deficits 
escalate when the economy failed to perform up to expectations 
the economic forecast forms the basis for estimating government 
tax revenues for the budget the reagan administration will present 
to congress in early january 
the deficit stood at 150 billion in the budget year that ended 
sept 30 and the administration projects it will be 132 billion for 
the fiscal year which begins next oct 1 without actions to reduce 
it 
based on that projection the administration would have to find 
32 billion in deficit reductions to reach the 100 billion deficit 
target established by the grammrudman law 
since officials have said reagan has no intention of proposing 
higher taxes in his final budget the reductions would have to come 
from steep spending cuts in domestic programs 
and if the administrations economic forecasts prove to be too 
optimistic bush will be faced with an even worse deficit and the 
possibility that acrosstheboard spending cuts could be triggered 
next october unless he is able to reach agreement with congress 
bush and his top economic advisers are giving no indication that 
they plan to deviate from his campaign pledge not to increase taxes 
even though a new report said bushs plan to balance the budget 
through a flexible freeze on spending would not work 
the report by the general accounting office the investigative 
arm of congress said that the united states cannot freeze our 
way out of the problem the gao said tax increases and cuts in 
defense and social security must be considered in any workable plan 
to eliminate the budget deficit 
bush asked about the report monday said that it did not change 
his strong opposition to tax increases 
im not going to change my view as to how we get this deficit 
down bush said i dont remember any republicans or democrats 
running on a pleaseraisemytaxes program

grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade with the wheat market showing 
new vigor on speculation that the agriculture department was 
preparing to offer wheat to china 
the rumors that the usda would target china for a large amount of 
us wheat at subsidized prices apparently were rooted in the buying 
activity of several grain companies notably cargill inc analysts 
said 
that sometimes touches off rumormongering but its hard to 
say how accurate the rumors were said walter spilka a grain 
market analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc in chicago 
that rumor comes up on a twoweek rotation he said 
corn and soybean futures advanced modestly mostly on 
followthrough buying from mondays late rally spilka said 
japan bought nearly 57000 metric tons of us wheat overnight 
while taiwan purchased 33000 metric tons of us soybeans 
at the close wheat was cent to 6 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 414 a bushel corn was 1 
cents to 2 cents higher with december at 262 a bushel oats were 
1 cents to 3 cents higher with december at 209 a bushel and 
soybeans were 2 cents lower to 6 cents higher with january at

presidentelect george bush spoke of 
working with congress and bringing people together to fight the 
federal budget deficit tuesday but he also said he wont bow to 
others suggestions that higher taxes are part of the solution 
bush made his comments to republican governors at a meeting 
during which they celebrated his election victory two weeks ago 
later he flew to houston for a getacquainted meeting with mexican 
presidentelect carlos salinas de gortari 
while bush was winning the presidential election the democrats 
were widening their lead in governorships and in the senate and 
house but bush told the governors we are on our way to becoming 
the majority party in america if we dont lose sight of what is 
driving our success 
renewing a campaign promise bush said he would convene a 
conference of all 50 governors very early in my administration

the american people agree with our philosophy bush said we are 
on the right side of the issues 
the american people in voting for me have said in clear terms

sometimes a public health crisis can be 
good for business 
such is the case with isomedix inc a publicly held 
sterilization company that has prospered as concern has escalated 
about acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
isomedix is in the business of killing microorganisms that gather 
on everything from cotton balls to artificial hip parts 
in the past year tiny isomedix has become the worlds largest 
provider of contract sterilization and attracted an unsolicited 
takeover offer from its principal competitor 
isomedix is emerging as one of the leaders of the industry 
said edward stavetski an analyst with wh newbolds son amp company 
in philadelphia it now has sales of 20 million and will 
eventually grow into a much larger business 
as it grows the new jersey firm is fending off a challenge from 
radiation sterilizers inc of fremont calif a privately held 
concern that has offered 9 per share or about 45 million to 
acquire isomedix 
radiation sterilizers had sales of just over 13 million in the 
year ended march 31 said michael goldman of thomson mckinnon 
securities inc the sterilizer companys financial adviser 
the offer launched this fall has been extended several times 
but isomedix has flatly rejected it as inadequate isomedix shares 
are currently trading over the counter at slightly over 7 
the offer is very conditional because no financing has been 
announced said susan noonan a spokeswoman for isomedix the 
company is strongly urging the shareholders to reject it 
goldman said the acquisition team is confident of its ability to 
raise the necessary financing but could not firm it up until federal 
regulators finish their review of the proposal 
because the two firms control about 85 percent of the national 
market for contract sterilization the federal trade commission is 
weighing the deals antitrust implications a ruling could come by 
the time the offers latest deadline expires on dec 9 
while both companies compete head to head in several spots around 
the country radiation sterilizers dominates the west coast 
isomedix is strong in the east and elsewhere and would help fill in 
some of the gaps in radiation sterilizers network 
isomedix has been around 15 years but the age of aids has 
heightened the need for properly sterilized medical instruments 
five or six years ago somewhere around 10 percent of all 
medical devices were radiation sterilized said george dietz the 
companys executive vice president today thats up to 40 to 45 
percent 
though too small to be followed by analysts from larger brokerage 
houses isomedix has already made its presence known in the health 
care field stavetski says 
for example isomedix sterilizes hospital gowns for johnson amp 
johnson purifies saline solution for bausch amp lomb inc and 
provides similar sterilization services for about 600 smaller 
companies in the united states and canada company officials say 
the companys thirdquarter sales were 44 million up 375 
percent from 32 million for the same quarter last year earnings 
for the quarter totaled 513310 or 10 cents per share about 2 
times the 144481 or 3 cents per share recorded for the same 
quarter last year 
earnings might have been even higher were it not for the takeover 
fight which drained an estimated 2 cents per share from the bottom 
line during the quarter noonan said 
isomedix had a net gain for the first nine months of 19 
million or 38 cents a share up from 514917 or 11 cents a share 
last year 
the company uses lowlevel radiation produced by cobalt60 to 
sterilize objects it plans to expand into other processes 
including gas sterilizers according to noonan 
the amount of time objects require treatment vary with the item 
and degree of sterilization required though it is usually one to 
three hours dietz says the objects whether they be ointments 
makeup or surgical gloves are placed in metal carriers that are run 
on monorails through an automated chamber most of the items never 
need to leave their packages 
the primary purchasers of the sterilized goods are manufacturers 
of prepackaged disposable medical devices and other industrial and 
consumer products 
isomedix is counting on steady growth and hopes to spread 
internationally dietz says if federal officials approve the 
irradiation of food the company could grow dramatically 
if and when irradiation is used it would be an explosion in 
use stavetski said 
currently the companys demand falls into two areas those 
disposable medical devices used in operating rooms such as catheters 
and surgical clothes and consumer items like bandages and baby 
bottle nipples dietz says 
stavetski attributes isomedix success to a strong management team 
that has positioned the company to take advantage of technological 
changes 
isomedix has 200 employees working in nine north american 
facilities including toronto chicago salt lake city and boston 
all the companys customers are within a 300mile radius of a 
facility enabling them to shuttle goods in and out for treatment

richard ferris whose dream of making allegis 
corp a complete travel company fizzled announced a new venture 
tuesday a onestop source book for vacations ranging from dude 
ranches to beach resorts 
the former allegis chairman is a chief investor and partner in 
the north american vacation brochure directory which unites 
some of the travel industrys major leaders including the travel 
industry association of america and family vacation services a 
major supplier of vacation brochures 
until now most people have found it necessary to spend a lot of 
time and effort writing or phoning numerous offices to request 
vacation brochures said marvin williams president of family 
vacation services in columbus ohio 
our directory solves this hassle by giving the consumer an 
opportunity to browse through the vacation facilities and services 
listed fill out one of the enclosed order cards for the desired 
brochures and then receive them in a single envelope mailed from 
the fvs fulfillment center williams said 
the directory a 495 booklet to be sold at bookstores 
newsstands and supermarkets will be available in february in 
addition to listing thousands of hotels resorts campgrounds 
historical sites and other vacation spots it will include calendars 
of seasonal events for all 50 states and the provinces of canada 
coupons for discounts at various vacation spots listed also are 
included in the directory published by meredith corp whose 
publications include better homes and gardens magazine 
so far 6000 vendors have agreed to list their vacation 
offerings 
merchants receive a free directory listing and are billed when a 
consumer specifically requests their brochures there is no charge 
for the consumer for the brochures 
ferris said he became involved at the request of paula spence 
president of hameroff milenthal spence inc a columbusbased 
travel promotion agency and one of the partners in the new directory 
after leaving allegis i received a lot of interesting mail 
ferris said this was pretty interesting i immediately recognized 
that here was an idea that the industry had long needed and wanted 
ferris declined to say how much he had invested in the project 
we think its a service to the consumer and a service to the 
industry said ferris 52 who resigned from allegis in june 1987 
amid turmoil within the companys various units including united 
airlines 
with ferris gone and his plans to create a travel conglomerate 
defeated allegis changed its name back to ual corp and launched a 
restructuring program to sell off its nonairline businesses hilton 
international co hertz co and westin hotel co 
ferris said if the directory proves to be a hit the partnership 
plans to create a computerized service offering personalized 
vacation planning for consumers

the soviet union has bought 500000 metric tons 
of us grain sorghum for delivery in the marketing year that began 
sept 1 the agriculture department said tuesday 
spokeswoman vivian ramey said it was the first time that the 
soviets have purchased us sorghum traditionally corn and wheat 
are the chief grains for import along with soybeans and soybean 
meal 
for example more than 59 million tons of us corn have been 
sold to the soviet union for delivery in 198889 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or sorghum grain or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 
500000 tons of sorghum would be about 197 million bushels or about 
11 million hundredweight 
sorghum prices last month averaged around 421 per 100 pounds or 
236 per bushel according to usda reports thus the sale could 
have a us farm value of about 46 million

hospital corp of america stock sagged 
tuesday in the wake of its approval of a 36 billion buyout offer 
from a managementled group and analysts say they expect the 
companys new owners will probably sell off up to 750 million in 
assets if the deal goes through 
in trading on the new york stock exchange hca lost 362 a 
share to close at 43 apparently reflecting disappointment that a 
higher bid did not emerge 
hcas board agreed late monday to sell the hospital management 
giant for 43 a share in cash and 8 in securities to tf investments 
inc a company formed by hca management and headed by hca chairman 
and chief executive officer thomas f frist jr hca has 714 million 
outstanding common shares 
the deal will be sumbmitted to shareholders of the nations 
largest health care concern sometime in february officials said 
hca said the managers had enough financial backing to complete 
the deal with eight lenders putting up 4 billion and investors 
committing 300 million for an ownership interest 
but one securities analyst said selling off some assets will 
probably be necessary 
ken abramowitz of the firm sanford c bernstein in new york said 
he expects management to sell up to 750 million of the companys 
52 billion in assets 
its just that in an lbo leveraged buyout you dont have the 
luxury of keeping nonearning assets abramowitz said in a 
leveraged buyout the buyers often borrow heavily against the assets 
of the company planning to repay the debt either through the 
companys earnings or selling assets 
thomas mcginnis jr with eberstadt fleming in new york said its 
almost certain that the management will have to sell off assets 
because the equity or stock ownership in the deal is relatively 
low 
joyce albers an analyst with first boston in new york said the 
company might sell its interest in equicor a health plans joint 
venture 
albers said managers could also sell their interest in 
healthtrust an employeeowned company in which hca owns preferred 
stock and bonds 
victor l campbell vice president of corporate relations said 
it was too early to discuss the possibility of selling divisions of 
hca 
there are no plans and really no discussion of that at this 
point he said tuesday we just got an agreement last night and 
now it has to go through a process of shareholder agreement which we 
hope to be complete by late february 
campbell said the management group expects to receive shareholder 
approval 
this best serves the company and all its publics he said 
the main reason that hca had been a public company dating back to 
1969 was in the 60s 70s and early 80s there was the need for 
capital because it was a growth industry for building new 
hospitals for expansion today it is a more mature industry the 
need for capital is no longer there 
clearly health care stocks and hospital stocks in general have 
been out of favor with the public for some time now he said

the reagan administration issued its final 
economic forecast on tuesday optimistically predicting that the 
economy will expand at a robust 35 percent annual rate next year 
however private economists said the projection was far too rosy 
and would spell big headaches for presidentelect george bush in his 
efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit 
the administration also was optimistic on the outlook for 
inflation predicting it would ease next year the forecast also 
said interest rates which have shot up recently because of 
inflationary fears would drop as well both of the assumptions are 
disputed by private economists 
the economic forecast provides the underpinning for the 
administrations estimates on government spending and revenues and 
the shortfall between the two the budget deficit 
the administration often has been criticized for basing its 
budget estimates on rosy scenarios only to see the deficit swell 
far higher when the optimistic growth outlook did not come about 
this estimate will form the basis for the administrations final 
budget to congress in early january the document will cover the 
1990 fiscal year which begins next oct 1 
joseph wright head of the office and managment and budget said 
in an interview after the economic forecast was released that the 
revised growth projections would add another 3 billion to the 
budget deficit for 1992 pushing it up to 135 billion that means 
reagan will have to come up with 35 billion in deficit reductions 
to meet the grammrudman target of a 100 billion deficit in 1990 
officials said the higher deficit figure resulted primarily from 
a slightly lower growth estimate for 1988 caused by the loss in farm 
income due to the drought 
beryl sprinkel reagans chief economic adviser told reporters 
the administration will meet the grammrudman target and will 
project a balanced budget in 1993 without resorting to increased 
taxes 
however private economists were skeptical contending that 
reagans final budget will make bushs deficit challenge even more 
difficult because it is based on unrealistic economic assumptions 
they said that when the economys actual performance is reviewed 
at midyear bush may have to propose even deeper spending cuts to 
make up for lost revenues or face the prospect of doing what bush 
has pledged repeatedly not to do raise taxes failing both of 
those the grammrudman law could trigger automatic 
acrosstheboard spending cuts 
to use the administrations estimate for budget policy is very 
risky said lawrence chimerine head of the wefa group a bala 
cynwyd pa economic consulting firm weve already seen signs 
that the economy is slowing 
blue chip economic indicators which surveys 51 top economists 
monthly said its consensus forecast for economic growth next year 
is 22 percent a full 13 percentage points lower than the 
administrations revised forecast 
but sprinkel insisted that private economists were being too 
pessimistic and were failing to take into account the boost the 
economy will receive next year once the effects of last summers 
severe drought are no longer felt 
i do not want to be accused of making the final forecast of the 
reagan presidency too rosy sprinkel said 
sprinkel said the drought had reduced gnp growth by 07 
percentage point this year and would boost growth by 08 percentage 
point next year 
sprinkel said without the drought growth this year would have 
been 33 percent exactly on target with the administrations 
revised estimate last august the administration on tuesday put 1988 
growth at 26 percent when measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 
in august the administration projected 1989 growth at 33 
percent which was revised to the 35 percent estimate in the newest 
forecast based on a better rebound in the farm sector than 
previously believed 
in other predictions the administration said inflationary 
pressures will ease substantially next year it predicted consumer 
prices will rise by just 37 percent down from an annual rate of 
46 percent in the first 10 months of this year 
however other economists expect inflation will worsen next year 
climbing above 5 percent because of a rebound in oil prices and 
production constraints in this country 
the administration also was optimistic on interest rates 
expecting threemonth treasury bills which on monday shot up to 
their highest levels in more than three years to begin coming down 
in 1989 averaging 63 percent for the year 
the interest forecast is used to estimate how much the government 
will have to pay to finance the 26 trillion national debt now the 
third largest spending category behind defense and the department of 
health and human services 
the administration forecast that unemployment next year would 
average 52 percent declining to 51 percent in 1990 and then 5 
percent in 1991 through 1994 the civilian unemployment rate was 53 
percent in october 
the administration forecast sees no recession through 1994 
projecting growth above 3 percent for the next six years 
economists also disputed this outlook calling it highly 
unrealistic to expect that the current expansion which has lasted a 
peacetime record of six years could last that long 
but sprinkel insisted that recoveries do not die of old age but 
rather by bad economic policies pursued by the government 
sprinkel said the administrations economic expectations were 
based on a belief that the countrys trade deficit would continue to 
make substantial improvements next year triggering continued strong 
business investment by companies expanding production facilities to 
meet higher export demand 
sprinkel also denied that there was any conflict between the 
administrations forecast for growth above 3 percent and the 
economic outlook at the federal reserve that the economy at this 
advanced stage of the recovery should be growing at a slower 2 
percent to 25 percent rate in order to avoid triggering runaway 
inflation

the investor group whose buyout offer was snubbed 
last month by tw services inc said tuesday that a delaware court 
dismissed on procedural grounds the groups challenge of the states 
antitakeover law 
new yorkbased coniston partners said the us district court for 
delaware on tuesday rejected its suit to have a portion of 
delawares antitakeover law declared unconstitutional 
the court based its action on the fact that conistons partial 
tender offer for tw services is not affected by the delaware law 
coniston said 
after its initial 28ashare offer was rejected coniston 
announced in late october that it would begin a 29ashare tender 
offer as the first step of a proposed 114 billion takeover of the 
food services giant the twostep buyout plan was aimed at 
sidestepping restrictions of the antitakeover law of delaware 
where tw services is incorporated 
the statute prohibits a hostile acquirer who buys 15 percent of a 
companys stock from completing a takeover for three years unless 
it immediately gets approval from 85 percent of the companys 
outstanding shares excluding its own 
conistons firststep cash tender offer for 1575 million shares 
amounting to about 45675 million would give the investors a 
majority stake in tw services the group already owns around 19 
percent of tw services 485 million common shares outstanding 
in a statement announcing the delaware court ruling coniston 
said it remains fully committed to acquiring tw services and 
intends to continue to explore alternatives to meet that objective 
in addition to its 1200 dennys and its 400 hardees fastfood 
franchise restaurants tw services also runs canteen corp a food 
services company and a small nursing home chain

american telephone amp telegraph co is proposing 
to start a new nationwide service that will connect callers with 
companies offering information on topics ranging from food 
preparation to legal advice 
callers from anywhere in the country could dial 1900 plus a 
sevendigit number and pay a flat rate to reach any of these 
services and the charges would appear on their monthly phone bill 
atampt said 
the new service may appeal to some companies that now offer 
tollfree 800 service if some of these companies switched to the 
new 900 service consumers could have to pay for some services they 
now get free 
atampt envisions the new service being used for example by 
companies interested in selling financial investment legal or 
medical advice a food company might offer recipes and a consumer 
product manufacturer might offer household maintenance tips the 
telephone company said 
the purpose is to get information when you need it at a flat 
rate from anywhere in the country said atampt spokesman ralph 
dobriner 
charges which would be determined by the sponsor of the service 
would range from 75 cents to 2 for the first minute and from 50 
cents to 1 for each additional minute 
atampt filed plans for its new multiquest service with the federal 
communications commission on monday the company said it wants to 
start the service jan 5 
dobriner said that while some switching from 800 service to 900 
service may occur many companies will stick with the tollfree 
service because it better suits its needs 
companies that might be inclined to switch are those that offer 
information as opposed to hotels and airlines which use 800 
numbers primarily for taking reservations he said 
this is a valueadded information service he said 
bruce kushnick of national televoice a marketing research and 
consulting firm that does work for telephone companies including 
atampt predicts some switching will occur because many companies see 
the cost of 800 service going through the roof 
however blair pleasant a telecommunications analyst with the 
yankee group in boston doesnt foresee many companies switching 
services but rather that that companies will find different 
applications for 900 services 
however she believes that 900 services are a novelty and 
that when people realize how much theyre going to have to pay for 
900 service they wont be as apt to use it 
mci communications corp and us sprint communications co atampts 
two largest competitors have said they plan to offer a similar 
service

while there have been improvements pilots at 
delta air lines continue to have problems with cockpit crew 
coordination and at times skirt established procedures the federal 
aviation administration said tuesday 
the faa said that while deltas management has taken strong and 
positive action in response to a critical review of the airlines 
operations 14 months ago much of its program has yet to be fully 
implemented 
both line operations and training were found to be improved 
an faa inspection team reported in a summary of findings from 
followup checks conducted at the atlantabased airline in early 
october 
a copy of the report became available tuesday 
delta spokesman bill berry said the company was in general 
agreement with the report 
delta has taken aggressive steps to deal with problems discovered 
by the faa in its audit more than a year ago berry said although 
the faa investigators found some stillexisting problems that will 
be addressed by programs just starting up 
we think they gave us a pretty good report although they 
recognized there are some things were just starting to do he 
said 
deltas cockpit operations and its training program came under 
intense faa scrutiny in the summer of 1987 after a series of errors 
by delta pilots brought the airline close to having several serious 
accidents including a nearcollision over the atlantic 
in a report in september l987 the faa chastised delta for 
lapses of discipline and allowing a breakdown of 
communications and coordination in its cockpits 
more recently federal investigators have focused on pilot 
performance in connection with the crash last august of a delta 
boeing 727 as it attempted to take off from the dallasfort worth 
airport authorities are trying to determine whether the threeman 
crew forgot to properly set the wing flaps causing the crash 
the faas latest report on delta makes no mention of the aug 31 
crash in which 14 of the 108 people aboard were killed 
it said the review in early october was aimed at reexamining 
deltas operations and training programs and to determine what 
corrective actions have been taken since the l987 audit 
while there were improvements noted the faa said deficiencies 
identified in the previous audit were observed including 
ineffective crew coordination and failure to follow established 
procedures during regularly scheduled flights 
delta has more than 6500 pilots 
the faa said that deltas check pilots should be tougher on line 
pilots during proficiency tests it said the pilots should be 
exposed to a greater degree of challenge rather than held to 
minimum standards 
deltas management said the faa has improved its operations and 
training manuals during the past year but fundamental changes to 
checklists and procedures are still pending and are not yet 
reflected in the cockpit 
some of the major actions taken by management have not yet 
become fully operational or have not yet become effective the faa 
said it cited as an example deltas revised cockpit resource 
management training program which has been under development for 
some time but is not scheduled to be implemented until next january 
it noted that delta plans to introduce next month a series of 
changes in the way pilots conduct checklists before departure and 
prior to landing the role of each pilot will become more clearly 
defined with pilots using the challenge and response technique 
more widely to guard against oversights 
the faa said it plans to continue monitoring the airlines 
progress on implementing the various programs already under way 
the ultimate effectiveness of these actions will depend on the 
companys commitment and the individual acceptance by middle 
management and the pilot group the faa said 
the faas special review of deltas training and cockpit 
procedures comes at a time of increased agency interest in how 
pilots perform in the cockpit 
that interest was sharpened after the august l987 crash in 
detroit of a northwest airlines jet in which the two pilots forgot 
to set the wing flaps preventing the aircraft from gaining proper 
lift 
at the time of the detroit accident the faas attention already 
had been aimed at delta because of a string of unusual errors by 
delta pilots during the spring and summer of l987 
that year a delta lockheed l1011 strayed 60 miles off course 
over the north atlantic and almost collided with a continental 
airlines jumbo jet after the delta crew entered the wrong navigation 
coordinates in a computer 
a captain of another delta plane mistakenly turned off both 
engines causing the jet to come within 500 feet of ditching into the 
pacific before the engines were restarted other 1987 incidents 
involved pilots landing at the wrong airport and on the wrong runway

the soviet unions first public copy 
centers will begin opening early next year under a joint venture 
between xerox corps european affiliate and a soviet agency 
the soviets have purchased copy machines for use within 
organizations but there have never been copy shops as you see in 
the west which provide access to ordinary businesses who dont have 
specialized equipment or the general public said ralph land 
general manager for xerox affiliate rank xerox ltd in london 
our soviet partners say we will be surprised with the pentup 
demand he said tuesday

rank xerox ltd will cooperate with vnesghtorgizdat the 
international division of the soviet state publishing organization 
together they will open equip and train staff for the copy centers

business community paid for in convertible currency and for soviet 
businesses institutions and individuals payable in rubles

soviet workers are allowed to use them none have been available to 
the general public until now 
land said he did not know how many copy centers eventually would 
be opened he said only one shop would be opened initially but we 
believe it will be successful and hope to be able to open many 
more 
rank xerox and vnesghtorgizdat also will establish a specialized 
copying service that for the first time will make artistic 
historic and archival russian documents available for sale to 
western universities and institutions 
there is historical material sitting in the soviet archives 
that is much required by scholars in the west and we will be able to 
copy that material and sell it to the western universities and think 
tanks land said 
paul bushkovitch associate professor of history and chairman of 
the soviet and east european studies council at yale university 
called the deal a breakthrough in communications 
he said of the soviets i think they got tired of doing things 
the old way when you deal with a soviet office you get at best a 
carbon copy theres one copy of everything this is no way to 
run things any more

chevron corp announced tuesday it had 
adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to prevent hostile 
takeovers 
the companys board of directors said no hostile bids had been 
made for chevron the nations fourthlargest oil company and 
blamed the current era of mergers and acquisitions for prompting the 
move 
we have instituted the stockholder rights plan in recognition 
of an extremely active merger and acquisition environment in which 
hostile nonnegotiated takeover bids have become common board 
chairman george m keller said in a statement 
the past two months have seen several takeover fights of 
unprecedented size including the record 20 billionplus tussle to 
acquire rjr nabisco inc and last months 131 billion agreement by 
philip morris cos inc to acquire kraft inc 
details of the chevron plan are outlined in a letter to be mailed 
to all stockholders after dec 15 the company said 
as part of the plan the board tuesday also declared a rights 
dividend payable on shares of chevrons common stock for each share 
of chevron common stock held at the close of business dec 15 
stockholders will receive one right 
the rights consist of a contingent right to purchase under 
certain circumstances one or more fractional shares of a newly 
created series of perferred stock or other securities in some cases 
the rights would become exercisable and trade independently from 
chevrons common stock 10 days after the acquisition of 20 percent 
or more of the voting power of chevron the company said 
the rights expire nov 22 1998 unless redeemed earlier by the 
company 
keller said many other public companies have adopted similar 
plans to enable their boards of directors to protect stockholders 
from offers they consider inadequate and coercive

federal agents apparently finished their search of 
records at blinder robinson amp co on tuesday in an investigation 
that officials said covered the same companies scrutinized in a 1987 
securities probe 
the search began saturday morning when 24 federal agents armed 
with a search warrant entered the firms headquarters in suburban 
englewood and began going through records 
denver spokesmen for the internal revenue service and us 
attorneys office have refused comment on the purpose of the probe

penalties by the national association of securities dealers the 
industrys selfregulatory body

publicly traded securities company executives said none of the 
investors is a blinder robinson employee or has an account with the 
brokerage said senior vice president steven b theys 
of the 16 issues blinder robinson probably had some market 
activity in eight or 10 of them but none of those are underwitten 
by blinder robinson theys said

turned over to the sec as part of an investigation last year 
theys said the federal agents worked in a reduced number at the 
office on tuesday and all left about 430 pm he said the blinder 
robinson staff and operations were at full strength tuesday about

prospects of a fatter price tag emerging in the 
record takeover struggle for rjr nabisco inc have propelled the 
companys stock higher and one main contender has signaled its plan 
to stay in the battle 
rjrs stock surged monday one day after its directors prolonged 
an unprecedented auction for the foodandtobacco giant reflecting 
their belief that even the priciest proposal valued at 2658 
billion is too cheap 
separately the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co a 
key bidder for the company indicated it would remain in contention 
by extending its current tender offer for rjr nabisco stock 
to some securities analysts following the deal the maneuvering 
amounts to a spectacular guessing game in which it is difficult to 
accurately value any of the bids or sense which direction the 
biggest takeover saga ever would take next 
this is not regular analysis this is guessing said emanuel 
goldman who follows rjr nabisco for painewebber group inc who 
knows whats going to happen these are uncharted waters 
part of the problem that the offers include securities that are 
difficult to price making it harder to value the entire package 
some analysts said 
these are cash and trash as they say said john maxwell 
who follows rjr nabisco for the richmond va firm wheat first 
securities you dont know how much the trash is worth until they 
get it defined for you 
a special committee of rjr nabisco directors had given 
prospective bidders until last friday to present proposals for 
buying the company maker of hundreds of consumer items ranging from 
winston cigarettes to planters peanuts and oreo cookies 
the directors received three bids and tried to evaluate them in a 
marathon weekend numbercrunching session but on sunday night 
extended the auction until nov 29 to give bidders time to amend 
their proposals and allow any new contenders to submit rival offers 
that move reflected the directors view that the unprecedented 
auction process required more time and that possibly higher offers 
could emerge 
wall street speculators reacted by bidding rjr nabisco stock up 
187 a share to 8587 monday in heavy new york stock exchange 
trading leaving the price nearly 54 percent higher than when the 
takeover battle began last month 
as of monday these were the contenders 
senior rjr nabisco managers backed by the investment firms 
shearson lehman hutton inc and salomon inc offering a package of 
cash and securities they valued at 100 a share or 2253 billion 
for the companys 2253 million shares outstanding 
kohlberg kravis backed by drexel burnham lambert inc and 
merrill lynch amp co offering a package of cash and securities they 
valued at 94 a share or 2117 billion 
first boston corp and resource holdings inc an investment 
concern led by the pritzker family of chicago and anschutz family of 
denver saying they could offer a package of cash and securities 
they valued at between 105 to 118 a share or 2365 billion to 
2658 billion 
although the first boston proposal looked the fattest it was a 
preliminary proposal that was vaguer than the others and structured 
to take place over an extended period of time rather than in a 
single transaction that would provide shareholders immediate payment 
before last friday the management group had offered 92 a share 
in cash and securities or 207 billion the kohlberg kravis group 
had made a tender offer directly to shareholders of 90 a share in 
cash and securities or 203 billion 
kohlberg kravis has argued its latest proposal was superior 
because the firm can simply and easily amend its earlier tender 
offer to reflect the higher 94ashare price speeding the payment 
to stockholders by bypassing potentially timeconsuming regulatory 
obstacles that rival offers may face 
kohlberg kravis on monday extended the tender offer expiration 
date from this friday to dec 13 thereby keeping the structure of 
that offer in place in case it wins the bidding contest

rupert murdochs news corp media empire is 
adding the disney channel to the four sky television services that 
it plans to bring to britain and ireland via satellite next year 
the venture will be the first of several satellitetohome 
television services that are expected to compete in britain over the 
next few years 
it gives murdochs sky television service the drawing power of a 
wellknown supplier of familyoriented programming and gives disney 
a readymade outlet in a new market as it expands globally 
including its planned 1992 opening of a european disneyland near 
paris 
viewers with satellite dishes in britain and ireland will be able 
to get three of the free sky television services which are a sports

deliver programming 
the five channels news international will be delivering to

debt load it will inherit from the company 
triangle said monday that it accepted an unsolicited offer from 
pechiney that will allow top management to buy back triangles 
nonpackaging operations for 225 million the 56ashare deal 
still needs regulatory approval 
triangle stock soared 3578 a share to close at 4625 in the 
overthecounter market monday 
triangle chairman nelson peltz and president peter w may control 
63 percent of the companys stock and have 89 percent of the total 
voting power before the company was taken semiprivate last summer 
triangle stock had been trading as high as 45 a share said timothy 
burns an analyst with prescott ball amp turbin inc of cleveland 
for peltz and may the cash deal provides a capital windfall 
while allowing them to concentrate on triangle operations outside of 
container and packaging manufacture which include the production of 
juke boxes and vending machines and wire and cable 
the acquisition would greatly strengthen pechineys presence in 
the consumer containers and packaging business making it by far the 
largest in the world as it prepares for the unification of the 
western european market in 1992 
pechiney is a diversified industrial group with operations such 
as metals production packaging and aerospace equipment 
in a statement pechiney chairman jean gandois said the company 
planned no major changes in management and strategic operations at 
triangles american national can 
together we will have the depth of resources leadingedge 
technology global distribution network and worldwide market 
presence necessary to compete successfully in todays rapidly 
changing and increasingly demanding marketplace gandois said 
under the definitive agreement pechiney would pay 56 cash for 
each of triangles common shares and 10102 cash a share for the 
companys 2 preferred stock which is convertible to 182 common 
shares 
triangles 15 percent preferred stock would be redeemed at 
1062 a share plus accrued dividends 
both companies valued the agreement at 126 billion but the 
price actually is higher when triangles debt is included pechiney 
essentially agreed to assume triangles outstanding debt which 
includes 26 billion in longterm securities 
burns speculated that pechiney may have to sell some of 
triangles assets such as its glass or plastics operations to 
reduce that debt 
triangle accummulated its huge debt load over the years through 
several acquisitions that have turned the company into the worlds 
biggest consumer packaging and container concern 
triangle acquired national can corp in 1985 and american can 
cos packaging business a year later all primarily financed 
through highyield lowrated junk bonds underwritten by drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
triangle manufactures metal glass and plastic containers and 
packing products through its american national can operations 
the company had been looking for ways to expand and about a year 
ago even considered making an offer for pechineys packaging 
operations 
we first became acquainted with pechiney management in 1987 
when we approached them about buying their packaging business cebal 
group peltz said in a statement we did not pursue that 
transaction however pechiney approached us recently with their own 
proposal for a business combination of pechiney and triangle 
the current proposal will enable anc american national can to 
fulfill that objective by providing it greater capacity to grow 
internationally 
triangles other interests include rowe international inc which 
manufactures vending machines and juke boxes brandt inc a 
manufacturer of automated coin sorters and counters and triangle 
pwc a producer of wire and cable 
triangle spokesman john w sullivan said that in addition to 
those operations peltz and may would acquire the companys new york 
headquarters and florida offices
