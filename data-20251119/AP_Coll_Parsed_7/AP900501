an indian tribe whose spearfishing has 
attracted protests plans to exercise a new treaty right cutting 
timber for free in public forests that are used by the states 8 
billionayear paper industry 
the mole lake chippewa band was authorized to begin cutting wood 
tuesday in the northern highlandamerican legion state forest north 
of minocqua 
ralph hewett a state department of natural resources forester 
in boulder junction said four loggers from the mole lake band 
cut a couple of trees for the tv cameras tuesday 
but they really couldnt get started because they were waiting 
for some shearing equipment he said 
they plan to sell the timber to existing mills but eventually 
want to start their own mills on the reservation 
hewett said the band was given permission to cut trees on five 
tracts of land totaling 898 acres the estimated value of the wood 
is 166000 he said 
the mole lake is one of the states six chippewa bands that 
retain the right to cut timber hunt and use spears to catch fish 
offreservation in northern wisconsin under 19th century federal 
treaties they retained those rights while giving up most of the 
land 
since a federal court upheld those rights in 1983 the bands 
have only exercised the right to spear fish out of season and have 
encountered sometimes violent protests by fishermen who fear game 
fish will be depleted 
so far the mole lake band is the only one seeking to cut timber 
the wood selected for cutting amounts to about half of what the 
state planned to offer for sale to nonindian loggers this spring 
in stateowned forests dnr chief forester charlie higgs said 
in past years the state has sold tracts in its forests to the 
highest bidding logging companies each spring those sales amounted 
to about 2 million over the last five years 
they indians dont pay anything for it the judge has ruled 
that they have the right to harvest this timber at no cost higgs 
said 
jim landru treasurer for the mole lake and coordinator of the 
tribes timbercutting activities said his band plans to sell the 
wood it cuts to offreservation mills in the future the band will 
build its own mills he said 
this is something to get our feet wet and see how the process 
goes landru said there were more timber tracts offered but 
we dont have the resource for more now 
he said the enterprise would help generate jobs on reservations 
where unemployment commonly exceeds 50 percent 
the state enacted an administrative rule under which the timber 
was offered first to the chippewa before nonindians were allowed 
to bid higgs said but in a lawsuit pending in federal court in 
madison the chippewa bands seek unlimited access to timber in 
state and countyowned forests 
landru said two indianowned logging businesses on the 
reservation will handle cutting and selling of the timber this 
spring he said the tribe would probably get 35000 and the 
logging companies might make from 160000 to 400000 profit 
higgs and hewett said nonindian loggers are concerned about the 
chippewa logging and are worried about the future effects of 
increased tribal logging on the states forest products industry 
which employs about 77000 people 
weve heard some expression from them already and expect well 
hear more in the future they are concerned about what will be left 
for them higgs said 
thomas schmidt president of the wisconsin paper council said 
tuesday the 33 state pulp and paper companies in his trade 
association were watching the situation 
we have monitored it very closely but we have taken no 
position on it he said 
schmidt said his group estimates about 2percent of the wood 
consumed by wisconsins paper and pulp companies comes from state 
forests each year and chippewa logging could cut into that amount 
because chippewa spearfishers have encountered demonstrations 
staged by antitreaty groups stop treaty abusewisconsin and 
protect americans rights and resources the mole lake members 
expect some resistance to their new endeavor landru said 
i would anticipate some problems the people here in northern 
wisconsin are basically good but there is that group with dean 
crist sta and parr that seem to cause problems he said 
crist a leader of stas antispearfishing protests said monday 
his group has warned about the economic effects of tribal logging 
and would consider staging some sort of protest 
higgs said nonindian loggers are concerned about their 
livelihood but he believed the chippewa timbercutting would be 
a peaceful endeavor we dont have any indication of 
demonstrations at this point

the remains of gen omar torrijos a 
former panamanian military leader were stolen tuesday from the 
crypt of a roman catholic church in the capital a police chief 
said 
leslie loaiza director of the judicial police said relatives 
of torrijos told police they believed the ashes were stolen from 
the corazon de maria roman catholic church in the afternoon 
a witness gave police the description of two suspects believed 
to have made off with them loaiza said in a live interview on 
kwradio continente he refused to give details other than repeat 
we have their descriptions 
loaiza said the generals eldest son martin torrijos and 
martins brotherinlaw marcelino jaen filed a complaint with 
judicial authorities 
torrijos the subject of the graham greene book getting to 
know the general seized power in a coup oct 11 1968 and ruled 
panama as a military strongman until his death in a plane crash 
july 31 1979 
his body remained in a mausoleum erected in his honor at nearby 
fort amador where us and panamanian military forces had a joint 
command until late december when the panamanian defense forces 
were disbanded following the american military invasion to oust 
torrijos protege gen manuel antonio noriega 
torrijos had celebrated panamanian nationalism and was behind 
the panama canal treaties under which the canal will be turned 
over from the united states to panama by the year 2000 
however his nationalist ideas fell from favor following the 
invasion and return to a civilianled government 
on feb 17 his body was removed from the mausoleum by his 
family cremated and the ashes deposited in the church crypt 
his daughter raquel torrijos said at the time the decision was 
taken because relatives had received anonymous calls saying the 
generals tomb would be desecrated and his remains stolen

gunfire killed two 
mohawk indians on tuesday and police later closed off the 
reservation torn by a 9monthold dispute over casino gambling 
troopers escorted investigators of the quebec provincial force 
through the new york section of the reservation tuesday night to 
reach the scene of the shootings which occurred early tuesday 
state police said they were entering the reservation as a 
peacekeeping force 
the first victim matthew pyke 22 was shot while he was 
walking in the st regis mohawk indian reservation in snye 
quebec during gun battle between rival factions 
a second body was discovered tuesday afternoon by joe gray 
regional editor for the daily courierobserver in massena gray 
said he saw a man lying faceup a short distance from where pyke 
was killed 
i walked past this tree and saw a guy laying next to his 
house he didnt respond gray said when i walked back he 
hadnt moved i yelled to him several times and he didnt move 
the man was later identified by the malone evening telegram as 
jr edwards a member of the warrior society a faction that has 
appointed itself the protector of mohawk sovereignty 
pierre lemarbre a constable with the quebec police said he was 
a mohawk in his 30s 
gov mario cuomo ordered state police to assist quebec 
authorities in the investigation state police supt thomas 
constantine recommended that no forces other than state police be 
sent onto the reservation 
troopers sealed off the reservation at approximately 830 pm 
tuesday roadblocks were set up on all roads leading onto indian 
land and even residents were not being allowed to pass 
the troopers told us we couldnt get in said tisha jacobs 
she and her family were waiting at a service station outside the 
reservation 
antigamblers blamed the reservations selfappointed security 
force for the first slaying and also pointed a finger of 
responsibility at cuomo who they said has let the situation get 
out of control 
pyke died at alice hyde hospital in malone after emergency 
surgery said joyce conto an emergency room staffer he was shot 
possibly twice in the lower left part of his back she said 
joe lazore who accompanied pyke to the hospital said he was 
walking alongside pyke when the shooting occurred lazore said the 
shots came from a wooded area on the american side of the 
reservation near the salmon river 
the reservation called akwesasne by the mohawks and some 
canadians occupies adjoining sections of new york state quebec 
and ontario 
the shooting was being investigated by the quebec provincial 
police along with the akwesasne police force and the new york 
state police said constable michel martin 
we dont have much information yet we havent even determined 
where the shots came from martin said 
pyke and several others were helping families leave the snye 
area following a barrage of shooting between 4 am and 7 am 
said barbara barnes a spokeswoman for the antigambling faction 
there also was shooting at st regis a community on the 
canadian side of the reservation and shots were fired at a refugee 
center on cornwall island in the st lawrence river where as many 
as 2000 mohawks are staying since fleeing their homes friday after 
a week of nightly violence she said 
barnes said pyke was opposed to the casinos and the presence of 
the warrior society a heavily armed faction that has appointed 
itself the protector of mohawk sovereignty 
the people are in shock and they are angry but not just with 
the warriors they are angry with governor cuomo this could have 
been avoided for a governor who says he stands by law and order i 
cant believe hes let it come to this point at akwesasne barnes 
said 
the warriors denied responsibility for the death 
the warriors were not involved in the shooting said minnie 
garrow who was answering calls at the groups headquarters we 
feel badly about the loss of life 
the gambling issue whether casinos and bingo halls should be 
allowed on the reservation has been at the center of escalating 
violence since last summer when an fbiled gambling raid triggered 
a 12day standoff between the warriors and state police 
the dispute also involves whether the reservation should be run 
by traditional or elected leaders and whether state and federal 
laws can be enforced on mohawk land 
sporadic shootings and violence were reported throughout the 
fall and winter but tensions began to mount in march when gambling 
opponents blockaded roads leading to the reservation to keep 
outsiders away from the highstakes casinos 
the antigamblers promised to maintain the roadblocks until 
tribal leaders addressed the reservations problems but last week 
progamblers tore down the blockades in a hailstorm of gunfire 
the first injuries came thursday when brian cole one of the 
barricade leaders was badly beaten and suffered a fractured skull 
he is still in an ottawa hospital 
on monday the governor agreed to assign one of his top aides to 
help negotiate a resolution provided the violence stopped and the 
casinos closed for now 
in ottawa canadian indian affairs minister tom siddon chastised 
cuomos response to the escalating violence 
it is our desire to see the state of new york cooperate and 
assist in dealing with the element progambling forces on the new 
york state side that appears to be provoking this incident 
siddon said tuesday in the commons 
and to this point were not satisfied the state of new york is 
responding adequately he said

the world war ii allies that carved up nazi 
germany will meet this week to discuss polands fear that a unified 
german state may try to take back some of its old lands 
foreign ministers from the germanys and the united states 
soviet union france and britain are to meet in bonn on saturday to 
discuss the global implications of german unification 
a team of experts from the six nations held preliminary 
discussions monday night to prepare an agenda for the historic 
talks 
after meeting for six hours at a secluded guest house near a 
castle north of east berlin the officials issued a brief statement 
saying polands borders would be discussed at the saturday session 
ultraconservatives in west germany say a united germany would 
have a valid claim to large sections of nazi germany that were 
ceded to poland to make up for a larger section of poland absorbed 
by the soviet union after the war 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany caused a furor earlier 
this year when he refused for several months to state unequivocally 
that a united germany would recognize polands existing borders 
he later said he would recognize the boundaries 
poland will be allowed to participate in the sixnation talks 
when its lands are discussed 
the greater issue in the international talks the role of a 
united germany in the superpower alliances is to be discussed at 
future negotiations involving the six nations alone 
moscow worried about disrupting the current european balance of 
power to its disadvantage has rejected the wests position that a 
united germany must be a nato member 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze secretary of state 
james a baker iii and west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher were to hold informal talks friday in advance of 
saturdays meeting 
soviet officials have indicated that they want a united germany 
to be military nonaligned with joint membership in both the 
warsaw pact and the north atlantic treaty organization 
east germany has said it is willing to agree to temporary nato 
membership if the alliance undergoes fundamental changes to reflect 
the eastwest thaw 
east germany is now in the sovietled alliance and west germany 
is in nato 
kohl tried to ease soviet objections on monday 
he said in a statement that he is certain that we will come to 
a reasonable agreement also with the soviet union on the matter 
of a united germanys strategic allegiances 
kohl added that west germany is ready for a comprehensive 
cooperation with the soviet union in the areas of economy 
technological exchanges athletic meetings and cooperation in 
security questions 
the statement did not elaborate on any of the points 
the two germanys meanwhile are holding separate talks on the 
domestic aspects of reunification they plan to merge their 
economies and social institutions by july 2 
delegations from both countries held more negotiations in bonn 
on monday and hoped to complete a final plan during meetings 
thursday and friday in berlin 
crucial differences still separate the germanys 
west germany has said it will trade most east german marks at a 
1to1 exchange but wants to trade personal savings accounts of 
more 2300 at a 2to1 rate 
east germany is demanding a higher ceiling and also wants to 
temporarily retain subsidies for housing energy and public 
services 
the two sets of talks on german unification likely will produce 
several agreements that will lay a foundation for unification but 
a full political merger between the germanys is not expected to be 
completed until next year

first they liked ike then they didnt like 
ike then they liked ike again thats the pattern of historians 
appraisal of dwight d eisenhower whose place in history is still 
to be fixed 
writing in the centennial year of eisenhowers birth historian 
alan brinkley says theres something to be learned about america 
and the american people from eisenhowers seesaw reputation 
brinkleys view is pertinent since george bushs presidency is 
sometimes compared to eisenhowers 
bush like ike is prudent uneager to expand governments role 
like ike bush is accused of lacking vision like ike bush 
presides at a time of peace and prosperity and is accused of doing 
nothing about problems looming just below the surface 
bush like ike is enormously popular in the polls at this 
stage he seems as unbeatable as was ike when he ran for 
reelection in 1956 
when people are suspicious of government have been disappointed 
by it and expect little from it says brinkley their appreciation 
rises for eisenhower and his safe but inactive tenure 
when people look to government for bold leadership and vision 
he says donothing ike falls in repute 
brinkley a 1971 graduate of princeton who was a snip of a lad 
when eisenhower was president is professor of history at the 
graduate school of the city university of new york he reviews the 
record in the wilson quarterly a magazine published by the woodrow 
wilson international center for scholars 
jimmy carter is undergoing the same sort of reappraisal thats 
been eisenhowers fate 
carters stance as an outsider and his ill never lie to you 
campaign seemed just the antidote to the disillusionments of 
vietnam and watergate but plagued by events beyond his control 
the iran hostage crisis and the oil embargo he left office 
condemned as ineffective 
lately building on his peacemakers reputation forged in the 
camp david accord carter has been winning fresh respect for his 
selfless pursuit of a better world 
in eisenhowers case he was much loved by a people he did not 
much lead 
his presidency says brinkley mirrored the success and 
complacency that characterized much of american life during the 
1950s the i love lucy era 
genial ike war hero played golf and bridge and palled around 
with rich businessmen despite his popularity historians had begun 
finding fault with his record even before he left office 
throughout the 1960s and much of the 1970s scholars dismissed 
eisenhower as a bland mediocrity a model of what a 20th century 
president should not be brinkley says 
a 1962 poll of historians ranked eisenhower 22nd out of 33 
presidents just above chester a arthur the charge was that he 
failed to govern or inspire historians saw him as passive 
ineffective even vaguely stupid brinkley recalls 
by the end of the 1970s however a new verdict was taking hold 
partially because the eisenhower papers had become available to 
scholarship 
no longer seen as the stumblebum ike now was regarded as 
decisive and skillful articulate informed and commanding 
in a new poll in 1982 historians ranked him ninth above john 
f kennedy 
this was postvietnam and postwatergate ike was seen as having 
shrewdly known the limits of american power 
the evaluation arose from the profound disillusionment with 
social activism that began during the late 1960s the association 
of liberalism with vietnam with economic instability with racial 
conflict and with the disappointing results of social policy 
initiatives brinkley says 
what doomed ike to condescension had been his refusal to 
accept the idea that government had a great and compelling 
mission says brinkley 
what raised him in estimation were those same qualities he 
says at a time when many americans came to question the 
desirability of a powerful president and the feasibility of a large 
and active government 
nothing in dwight d eisenhowers uneventful presidency 
ensures him an important place in political history he was not a 
lincoln or wilson or roosevelt who led the nation through great 
crises says brinkley he was not a kennedy or johnson or 
nixon who for better or worse charted new paths and left the 
nations public life forever altered 
brinkleys verdict ikes reputation will remain a hostage to 
americans fluctuating expectations of their leaders and their 
state

kay orr made history in 1986 when she 
became the nations first republican woman to be elected a 
governor but democrats eyeing her low job approval ratings hope 
her tenure itself soon will be history 
mrs orr whose troubles began in 1987 when she pushed through a 
tax overhaul that turned out to be a tax increase acknowledges she 
has problems but says they can be overcome 
we need to get across our message and our record of 
accomplishment she said in a recent interview were working 
on it 
four democrats in a field of seven are in a tooclosetocall 
race for their partys nomination in the may 15 primary 
mrs orr 51 faces only token primary opposition but 
nonetheless is running nononsense television commercials and has 
raised nearly 1 million in campaign contributions 
in one tv ad she acknowledges the political faux pas on the tax 
package and says i made a mistake 
the governor and her pollster dispute a recent omaha 
worldherald poll that put her job approval rating at 39 percent 
the lowest in the 20year history of the poll she said her own 
polling showed her with a 52 percent approval rating statewide 
state gop chairman norm riffel contends that mrs orrs 
political strength will prove ample once she has a single opponent 
to run against rather than seven democratic foes training their 
fire on her 
democrats seeking to unseat her include former omaha mayor mike 
boyle omaha attorneybusinessman ben nelson lincoln mayor bill 
harris and bill hoppner of lincoln a businessman and former top 
aide to sens bob kerrey and jim exon 
mrs orr appeared to be on an historic roll when she was elected 
in 1986 she defeated democrat helen boosalis in the nations first 
gubernatorial race in which both major party candidates were women 
another political first had come in 1982 when she was elected state 
treasurer and thus became the first woman elected to a statewide 
constitutional office 
an early and ardent supporter of former president reagan mrs 
orr was cochairman of the platform committee at the 1988 
republican national convention president bush and vice president 
dan quayle both have visited nebraska in recent months to campaign 
for her 
mrs orr came under fire when she pushed through a rewrite of 
the states income tax system in 1987 along with major legislation 
giving tax breaks to business for job creation and new investment 
critics said at the time it was a tax increase for lower and 
middleincome nebraskans mrs orr who had campaigned on a pledge 
to fight new or higher taxes first argued that it wouldnt be a 
tax increase period she later acknowledged that the tax burden of 
some would increase but the overall income tax rewrite would be 
revenue neutral she was wrong again 
mrs orr is hoping to turn the tax issue around and use it to 
her benefit now that the 1990 legislature has overridden her veto 
of a bill to raise state sales tax and income tax rates to help 
reduce property taxes 
she presents herself as having learned a lesson in 1987 and 
being thus dedicated to protecting taxpayers from a program she 
says wont guarantee property tax relief 
on the democratic side harris and hoppner have raised questions 
about nelsons connections direct or indirect with the junk bond 
industry nelson said his specialty was ensuring that companies 
complied with government regulations in that area 
to criticize me is like criticizing the fireman for the 
fire he said

here is the text of remarks by president bush 
and former hostage robert polhill during a ceremony monday at the 
white house 
president bush well let me say the purpose of all of this is 
simply to welcome mr and mrs polhill to the white house i just 
had a chance to tell him how pleased we are that he is free and 
of course this comes at a very special moment because mr reed is 
now free and i expect to be talking to him as soon as he finishes 
that initial contact and debrief over there hopefully within the 
next hour or two 
but i do want to take this opportunity to thank syria for its 
role in not only bringing mr polhill home but its role in the 
reed release similarly to thank iran for its role and simply to 
say that i hope this is a forerunner to the release of the other 
american hostages and the others from other countries held against 
their will things seem to be moving on this 
and mr polhill welcome to the white house and i just cant 
tell you how overjoyed barbara and i are to have both of you here 
mr polhill thanks very much president bush i feel very badly 
that i cant talk to you quite as well as id like to be able to 
because there are a lot of things i want to say to the american 
people 
but the most important thing i think now to say is to reinforce 
what president bush has just said that i am at this moment truly 
as happy for frank and fifi reed as i was eight days ago for ferial 
and myself and for both families i sincerely hope that frank is 
step two in what will be a continuing release of hostages and 
bringing us all back from american hostages through all of the 
other countries who may be involved 
the warmth and sincerity of the welcome ive received everywhere 
i have been from damascus to wiesbaden to washington has been 
truly thrilling frank reed is going to feel the way i felt because 
the american people are behind us and have been behind our families 
throughout this ordeal and were deeply grateful to you for that 
im not going to try to say very much more because i know even 
with the help of this device youre not going to get very much 
more so ill even though im a bit of a ham you see id like 
to be able to do better but youll have to work with my sons i 
think thank you so much 
q mr president will israel now cut a deal for the remaining 
shiite prisoners 
president bush i have no knowledge of anything of that nature 
q would it help 
q mr president why do you think that iran and syria are 
cooperating at this point 
president bush well because i hope there is a realization that 
holding people against their will is not the way to effect 
political change im not suggesting in reply to your question 
that syria and iran are the ones that are holding the remaining 
hostages but i cant explain the rationale but i can express a 
certain gratitude that things seems to be moving and what i feel in 
my heart about the return of now these two americans is in a 
sense overwhelming but i dont think any american can totally 
rejoice until the rest are free and indeed we cant limit our 
concern and our feelings to just the americans in my view 
so we will just keep on track and when as now theres a reason 
to say thank you certainly well do that but beyond that i 
just hope that the process if this is process i hope it 
continues and i dont want to make mr polhill speak again but i 
feel confident i speak for him and for his wife and you heard what 
he said beautifully about mr reed and we feel that way about all 
the rest of them too 
q is there any way possible at this point to return the goodwill 
gesture 
president bush were as ive said we cant you know in 
terms of overall relationship between countries expect normalcy 
until or expect vast improvement until all americans are freed 
were not in a piecemeal basis bidding for human life holding out 
hopes only to have them dashed one american family or another 
that is not the way i see certainly my responsibilities but when 
a step is taken that goes toward that day when all hostages are 
released i should say thank you but beyond that i cant say that 
i that i can be happy i try to put myself in the place of the 
other families and say hey how about my loved one 
and so this is a tough business and i just want to conduct the 
policy of this country in a way to facilitate the continuation of 
this process if indeed it is a process and i dont know that 
and i dont expect mr polhill knows it either ive got time 
for a couple of more and i dont want to keep this tired man 
make him even tireder yeah

q mr president can you tell us what it is that iran did that 
youre thanking them for and whether youve had any further 
information on whether they aided in mr polhills release 
president bush well we did hear from syria that iran had been 
helpful and it is that that im saying thank you for it is 
q and for mr polhill 
president bush yes 
yes 
q is it time for israel to perhaps make a deal to release 
sheik obeid or the 400 shiites or would you object if they didnt 
president bush i dont there is certainly no objection and 
that is a matter for others to determine ive stated that holding 
people against their will is not a way to facilitate political 
change or any other kind of change so thats it last one yeah 
ellen 
q mr president are you rejecting or holding out any type 
of a goodwill gesture towards iran and syria at this time until all 
the americans are released 
president bush ive said that we cannot have normalcy as long 
as any american is held against his will and i think everybody 
understands that that in terms of expressing appreciation to 
those who facilitated the release of mr polhill or the release of 
mr reed certainly im prepared to do that ive done that here 
today but that i cant say that thats an overwhelming 
expression of good will because i have on mind those other six 
americans that are held 
but look if its beginning to work and if indeed theres a 
process i expect i speak for all americans when i say i rejoice in 
that but thats about where weve got to leave it ellen weve 
got to see every american returned and thats the way its going 
to be and im very pleased that this polhill release has been 
facilitated and you heard him express his joy for the reeds and 
all id say to that is amen thank god 
several questioners speak at once 
president bush i cant take any more questions we i cant do 
it laughs 
q mr polhill audio break anything that could be done to 
return the goodwill gesture at this point 
mr polhill no im not conversant you may be surprised but i 
really dont know very much about what was going on around me so 
i dont think i can offer a lot of help to anyone the only thing i 
can suggest is that the american people continue to show as 
hostages continue to be released on a regular basis how much we 
are wanted back and i think that message might get across very 
clearly 
president bush thats a good point thats a good point 
q are you carrying a message to the president are you carrying 
a message from the hostagetakers 
mr polhill they said i was 
president bush deal with these guys youll be out here all 
night laughter

an american defector who traded texas for moscow 
says he and his family have been warmly welcomed but that hes been 
surprised to find himself defending socialist ideals from criticism 
by soviet reformers 
arnold lokshins comments carried in mondays editions of 
pravda offered a rare glimpse into the life of one of the few 
westtoeast defectors 
since leaving the united states 3 years ago lokshin has 
declined to speak to american reporters and has dropped from the 
sight of the foreign community 
pravda said he runs a government cancer research laboratory and 
lives with his wife and three children in a threeroom apartment on 
novocheremushkinsky street in southern moscow 
his wife lauren keeps house and looks after the children 
jeffrey in ninth grade michael in second grade and jennifer a 
student in the mikhail lomonsov chemical institute the communist 
party daily said 
the article did not say how the lokshins were coping with the 
hardships and consumer shortages of life in the soviet union 
in the pravda interview lokshin voiced political views that 
appeared conservative in the context of the reform movement 
sweeping the country 
he stood up at a political meeting in moscow last week and said 
we are often asked what did you find in the soviet union that 
you least expected the report said 
we never expected that an american family in the soviet union 
would be defending the october revolution socialism and the 
teachings of lenin pravda quoted him as saying vladimir i 
lenin led the october revolution that forged the soviet state in 
1917 
we arent tourists here we came a long time ago and we are 
getting our feet on the ground therefore we feel like part of 
your society and not sideline observers lokshin said 
at the same time we realize perfectly well that we do not 
have the right to interfere in your internal affairs after all we 
are still citizens of the united states lokshin said 
lokshin then 47 fled with his family to the soviet union in 
october 1986 saying he had been a communist party organizer and 
had been fired as head of st joseph hospitals cancer research 
institute in houston because of his political views 
his former employers said he was fired because of job 
performance 
when we came to the soviet union we had no illusions 
lokshin said our departure from the usa was necessary an 
extreme step and we did not expect to find such a heartfelt warm 
welcome in the soviet union 
we now have quite a few friends among the soviet people with 
whom we can openly discuss the most varied problems agreeing 
with some disagreeing with others lokshin said 
and he regretted that some people with whom it was impossible to 
discuss politics unfortunately still hold positions of 
responsibility unfortunately bureaucratism is still strong

communications problems with a circling us air 
force gunship may have hampered efforts by american commandos to 
seize a civilian airport at the start of the panama invasion 
janes defense weekly reports 
four navy seal commandos were killed and eight wounded in the 
first stages of the december invasion as they tried to secure the 
civil airfield at paitilla on the southeast coast of panama city 
janes reported that the sea air and land commandos could not 
communicate with the ac130 gunship which could have provided 
valuable intelligence and fire support 
excerpts of the article came in a magazine release monday ahead 
of the issues publication saturday 
it said the aircrafts sensors and night vision equipment might 
have been able to spot panamanian defense forces troops and alert 
the seals it said the seals could also have called upon the 
gunship for highly accurate targeted firepower to suppress the 
panamanian troops 
janes said in a report from washington that a force of 48 seals 
was ordered to secure the airport where panamas thenleader gen 
manuel antonio noriega kept his private plane 
american officials feared noriega who was wanted on drug 
charges in the united states would flee in the plane 
the magazine said the seals encountered snipers almost as soon 
as they landed at the airport it said they achieved gunfire 
superiority within five minutes and disabled noriegas aircraft 
by firing antitank rounds into it but still lost men 
the seal leadership is examining how the fatalities and 
casualties happened the magazine said 
it quoted an unidentified senior navy official close to 
operation just cause as saying the organization looked at 
whether the seals were adequately armed and whether the mission was 
appropriate for the relatively small number of seals deployed 
the magazine said the air force has told the navy it was able to 
communicate with all other units except the seals suggesting 
that the seals were the reason for the lack of communications 
it said the seals maintain they tried unsuccessfully to call the 
ac130 on every possible frequency and that the aircraft did not 
respond janes said that the next day the seals were able to 
communicate easily with other ac130s brought in to fly air cover 
it quoted the naval official as saying it was not known why 
communications with the gunship failed he was quoted as saying it 
was unclear whether there would have been fewer casualties had the 
seals been able to talk to the planes crew 
janes said the us navy and us special operations command 
have not provided public details of the gunfire exchange between 
the seals and the panamanian units 
noriega surrendered to us troops and was taken to florida 
where he is in jail awaiting trial on drug charges 
civilian guillermo endara who was winning an election in may 
1988 when noriega stopped ballotcounting now is president

francisca centenos blood ran cold 
as she listened to a contra rebel describe his part in a 1987 
attack on this cooperative farm that left her home a smoldering 
ruin 
he was all worked up telling how he set a truck on fire with 
his machine gun said the 28yearold mother of five an infant 
on her hip 
after attacking the las colinas cooperative three times since 
1984 the contras are back the sandinistaorganized project where 
60 familes cultivate corn beans coffee and bananas sits in the 
heart of security zone 1 
the zone is about 80 miles north of managua and is one of five 
unmonitored enclaves where the antisandinista irregulars are 
gathering for what is supposed to be their demobilization 
but the contras are refusing to heed calls from the new 
government to surrender their weapons and have threatened to resume 
the civil war that claimed some 30000 lives if sandinistas are not 
removed from positions of power in the military 
the contras behavior in las colinas has raised fears among 
members of the cooperative many of whom were landless peasants 
before the sandinistas organized the farm and who remain loyal to 
the leftist revolution 
residents say they fear the rebels will seize their homes and 
evict them 
such fears are part of the reason sandinista gen humberto 
ortega wants to retain control of the army until the contras 
disarm they also explain why the sandinistas passed out weapons to 
their loyalists in some parts of the countryside after violeta 
barrios de chamorro won the feb 25 elections 
in las colinas the sandinistas disarmed so the contras are in 
command 
were civilians they walk through here armed to the teeth 
and were afraid said mrs centeno 
she said the contra fighter who recounted the 1987 attack stood 
right at the stoop of her home and was belligerent and threatening 
it felt like my blood was freezing she said 
he said we should start looking for someplace else to live 
because they were going to take our houses and stay here for 
good she said tears coming to her eyes a mother with five 
kids doesnt want to become a rolling stone 
about 4000 of the ussupported rebels have arrived in zone 1 
the largest of the five enclaves 
hundreds are also camped within a mile or two of las colinas 
and contras can be seen walking the settlements dusty paths or 
sitting on the cement porches of the homes the walls of most of 
the homes are covered with sandinista slogans or campaign 
propaganda hailing daniel ortega who lost the feb 25 election to 
mrs chamorro 
a banner at the entrance to the settlement saluting residents 
who died in the nineyear civil war as heroes and martyrs was 
torn down by contras last week 
were sandinistas but we also love peace said one 
resident 20yearold ramon celedon 
celedon like all men of the settlement was part of the local 
militia but handed in his weapon on april 21 on the orders of a 
sandinista army officer 
i feel like i was tricked said celedon if they the 
contras dont hand in their guns then we handed ours in for 
nothing 
pedro aguilar said he feels humiliated when armed contras walk 
through the cooperative 
they walk through here and in an offensive way tell people how 
they won the war said aguilar thats a lie but it makes us 
feel humiliated his father benvenuto was one of seven members 
killed in a june 3 1987 contra attack 
as aguilar spoke a contra fighter with a rocketpropelled 
grenade launcher over his shoulder walked into his home the contra 
was obviously acquainted with aguilar and exchanged a few words 
with his wife 
if they dont disarm we are determined to defend the 
revolutions achievements aguilar said we would be willing to 
rearm because to allow oneself to be kidnapped or killed with 
impunity would be a sin 
on another porch two contras wilmer picado and francisco 
herrera quietly conversed with cooperative member santos aguilar 
and his wife maria 
santos aguilar no relation to pedro fought the contras in 1987 
when he served in the sandinista army 
we have to bury the past santos aguilar said 
picado agreed the goal now is that there be peace

it was the bang not the bite that 
had jerry dewitt jittery after tearing into an old vaccum cleaner 
bag 
dewitt found a 3footlong rattlesnake in the bag april 22 when 
he picked up an abandoned vacuum cleaner from a shed to toss onto a 
junk pile 
he killed the snake with a long spear more often used on frogs 
then opened the bag to make sure the poisonous creature had no 
friends 
instead dewitt discovered three tubes about 9 inches long that 
were labeled termanix highly explosive if armed he called 
authorities 
the snake didnt bother me if it had been a little bigger i 
would have skinned it dewitt said but the explosives kind of 
gave me a shock because i was beating on the bag trying to get the 
snake

american hostage frank reed was freed 
monday after being held for 43 endless months much of the time 
blindfolded by shiite moslem kidnappers in lebanon he was the 
second american freed in nine days 
id like to tell my family especially my son tarek that his 
daddy is well he is a little skinny but he will be home very 
soon the 57yearold educator from malden mass told staterun 
syrian tv after his release 
he flew from damascus to rheinmain air base just outside 
frankfurt west germany early tuesday aboard a us air force c141 
transport plane arriving in brilliant sunny weather 
he was boud for nearby wiesbaden where he was to undergo the 
customary medical checks at a us military hospital and a state 
department debriefing 
reed wearing a white shirt and a dark suit stepped off the 
plane looking sprightly he made no comments to reporters but blew 
them a kiss 
the former captive walked quickly across a red carpet that had 
been laid out in his honor and made the v for victory sign 
with both hands in the air a small crowd of military personnel 
nearby applauded 
at one point reed reached down and touched the ground on the 
way to a small van that took him to a waiting helicopter for the 
trip to wiesbaden an air force honor guard stood by 
in the boston suburb of malden reeds syrian moslem wife 
fahima fifi reed 39 saw her husband on television and 
exclaimed he looks great hes in a suit i want to see 
everybody happy as i am now 
she will join him in wiesbaden 
reed director of a private school in beirut and a beirut 
resident since 1977 converted to islam to marry fahima tarek is 
their 9yearold son 
reed was freed in beirut at 830 pm 130 pm edt syrian 
officials said and was driven to the syrian capital where foreign 
minister farouk alsharaa turned him over to us ambassador edward 
djerejian 
president bush hailed reeds release as bush welcomed former 
hostage robert polhill to the white house another us educator 
who was freed in lebanon on april 22 after 39 months in captivity 
bush thanked syria and iran for their help in securing the releases 
and said things seem to be moving but that there could be no 
rest until all hostages are free 
there are still 16 westerners including six americans held in 
lebanon 
the iranian newspaper tehran times said tuesday that unless 
washington answers the latest releases with goodwill gestures no 
more americans will go free 
sharaa said at a ministry briefing featuring reed i hope this 
second gesture of good will will be met with a similar gesture of 
good will during the process of releasing the rest of the 
hostages 
djerejian thanked syria for its active role in reeds 
release and made special note of the help from iran 
reeds kidnappers who called themselves the organization of the 
islamic dawn in a communique sunday that promised reeds release 
within 48 hours said he would carry a message to the us 
government 
but reed who appeared pale and had grown a white beard 
mentioned no such message and declined to answer reporters 
questions out of concern for those still held i do not want to 
say anything that could harm them 
the freed captive appeared in reasonable health he wore a dark 
suit and a blue tie his voice was husky 
reed said he hoped the other hostages will be freed soon but 
would not say if he saw any of them in captivity however reed 
referred to we while describing the conditions of his captivity 
after saying he had adequate food and fresh fruit and a chance 
to bathe and shower he said we were given fresh clothes fairly 
regularly washed and so on 
our problem was the passage of endless time we had no 
information we had no nothing we had no radio we had no news 
there were times i really did not even know what month it was 
we were given lots of books and allowed to watch tv but never 
the news however he later said i refused the books and tv i 
didnt want to be entertained when i lost my freedom 
he said on tv of his captivity it was lonely it was boring 
reed spoke haltingly at times his eyes downcast i havent 
talked much as a hostage he explained 
he said he did not hold the lebanese people responsible for his 
ordeal and he thanked syria for its efforts in helping me become 
a free man 
reed said he was blindfolded 24 hours a day during much of his 
captivity 
i feel odd that my blindfold is not here he said touching 
his face 
i hope godspeed that my colleagues somehow will be 
released soon reeds abduction was earlier claimed by the 
organization of arab revolutionary cellsomar mukhtar brigade 
in beirut reed was handed to officers of the syrian army 
contingent that controls east and north lebanon as well as moslem 
west beirut where reed was kidnapped on sept 9 1986 said the 
syrian officials who refused to be identified the syrian military 
presence dates from an arab league peacekeeping mandate in the 
15yearold lebanese civil war 
the officials refused to specify the release site 
most of the remaining hostages are believed held by shiite 
groups loyal to iran longest held is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
following polhills release by a shadowy faction calling itself 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine iranian officials 
and lebanese shiite leaders called for reciprocal releases of 
shiite fundamentalists held by israel and kuwait 
the tehran times said tuesday release of two american 
hostages without any preconditions and solely for humanitarian and 
islamic causes was an extreme gesture of good will and 
selfsacrifice by lebanese moslem groups 
the islamic republic used its maximum power and credibility 
for the release of the hostages naturally without an appropriate 
response from the west there is no chance for the continuation of 
iranian mediation 
now the ball is in the court of the us and the western 
countries said the paper which is close to iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani 
it said iran and the militants in lebanon expect washington and 
its allies to pressure israel to release a significant number 
of detainees specifically sheik abdulkarim obeid 
obeid is a shiite cleric with the proiranian group hezbollah 
he was abducted by israel from south lebanon on july 28 1989 
the proiranian hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for 
factions holding most of the hostages in lebanon 
besides tarek reed has two children jacqueline and marilyn 
from his first marriage they live in medford mass 
reeds 91yearold mother leota sprague said monday she never 
lost faith her son would be free one day 
i havent been able to cry for four years she said now i 
can smile and say thank god

the state department marked the 15th 
anniversary of the fall of saigon by saying vietnams troops in 
cambodia are hampering the administrations efforts to establish 
normal diplomatic relations with vietnam 
the formal precondition for normalization remains an 
acceptable political settlement in cambodia which includes 
verification of the complete withdrawal of vietnamese forces 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said monday 
the vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach said in an 
interview with time magazine last week that the united states was 
using cambodia as a pretext for not establishing diplomatic 
relations and that his government had met all conditions 
previously set 
those conditions he said included agreements on accounting for 
missing us military personnel reunification of vietnamese 
families split by the war and on ending human rights abuses in 
reeducation camps 
we would like to have normal relations with all countries in 
indochina including vietnam ms tutwiler said we have no 
philosophical objection to normalization of relations with 
vietnam 
she added as a practical reality the pace and scope of 
normalization will depend upon continued cooperation with us on the 
powmia and other humanitarian issues 
ms tutwiler declined to elaborate on what might constitute a 
philosophical objection 
the fall of saigon on april 30 1975 ended the vietnam war with 
a victory for communist north vietnam over south vietnam backed by 
the united states and the extinction of the south vietnamese 
government 
the united states and unified vietnam have not had normal 
diplomatic relations since

spina bifida a common and severe birth 
defect may one day be prevented by surgery to patch the fetal 
spine inside the womb a new study indicates 
the study conducted by johns hopkins university in baltimore 
suggests spina bifida may result in part from exposure of the 
spinal cord to the wombs amniotic fluid according to dr dan s 
heffez 
heffez assistant professor of neurosurgery at johns hopkins 
presented the studys findings monday to the american association 
of neurological surgeons 
spina bifida is caused by the failure of the spine and skin to 
form over the spinal cord and the most serious form occurs in an 
estimated one of 1000 births 
the study showed baby rats were paralyzed if the protective 
spinal cord covering was surgically removed while they were still 
in the womb but if skin was sewn over the wound within 24 hours 
the rats were entirely normal heffez said 
heffez said spina bifida damage may not occur until the 20th 
week of pregnancy when amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus 
changes in a way that may jeopardize an unprotected spinal cord 
but a hole in the spine can be diagnosed through blood tests and 
ultrasounds by the 18th week of pregnancy and fetal surgery has 
been attempted before 20 weeks to correct other problems heffez 
said 
years of research remain before such a procedure could be 
attempted on a human fetus according to heffez he said johns 
hopkins researchers are conducting studies to discover whether the 
damage is progressive in humans 
we need first to establish beyond a doubt that in man this is 
a progressive problem he said we have to follow fetal leg 
movements with ultrasound something we are trying to do right 
now 
the damage would be considered progressive if leg movements 
diminished over time in fetuses diagnosed with spina bifida heffez 
said 
spina bifida can cause paralysis of the legs loss of bladder 
and bowel functions and a malformed spinal cord the afflicted can 
live into adulthood but are more susceptible to infections because 
of the open wound and hole in their spine and they require 
lifetime care 
the longterm cost is enormous heffez said i dont think 
you can put a number on that cost or on the wasted potential

the united states has resumed relations with 
the leftist government of south yemen after nearly 21 years 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler on monday said 
the united states seeks a useful productive relationship 
south yemen has had close ties with the soviet union and is the 
only arab nation that has pursued marxist policies the united 
states has accused it of engaging in statesponsored terrorism 
ms tutwiler said south yemen has been intent on maintaining 
peaceful relations with its arabian peninsula neighbors and has 
begun liberalizing its economy and its political system 
its record on terrorism also has improved she said 
we hope to see continued good relations among the countries in 
that area contributing to regional stability and further economic 
progress she said 
south yemen continues to be on a us list of countries that 
engage in international terrorism because terrorist organizations 
have been allowed to maintain facilities there and south yemeni 
officials have provided refuge for airline hijackers she said 
however a state department report on terrorism made public 
monday asserts that south yemen has considerably reduced its 
support for terrorism since the early 1980s

republicans changed their minds and decided 
not to put president bushs 12 trillion budget for 1991 to a vote 
by the democraticcontrolled house today 
admitting he found the decision embarrassing rep bill 
frenzel of minnesota the house budget committees ranking 
republican said he made the decision monday after consulting with 
gop leaders 
nonetheless it seems to represent a concession that some 
republican lawmakers would prefer not to vote for a bush budget 
that some see as outdated and politically unattractive 
the house was expected to approve a democratic alternative today 
that spends less on defense and more on domestic programs than the 
president desires the senate budget committee plans to resume its 
sofar fruitless search for consensus on a package of its own 
the gops decision to avoid a vote on the presidents spending 
plan has little practical importance for todays house debate 
bushs budget was certain to be defeated in the house where 
democrats outnumber republicans 258176 
theres a feeling among republicans that the budget has been 
passed by economic and political events frenzel said of bushs 
spending plan to debate it is a waste of time we have to do a 
real job based on the realities of the day 
since bush unveiled his spending plan in january the economy 
has performed more weakly than anticipated and the soviet blocs 
military threat has deteriorated 
gop lawmakers had until now viewed bushs proposal as a rallying 
point and as a bargaining position in what they hope will be future 
budget negotiations between the white house and congress 
in his budget bush proposed spending 3037 billion for defense 
in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 that would be 7 billion more 
than this year but 32 billion less than needed for military 
programs to stay even with inflation 
but citing the warsaw pacts collapse house democrats want to 
cut defense to 2954 billion 
in further contrast with bush democrats are proposing spending 
2243 billion on domestic programs ranging from environmental 
cleanups to housing aid for the poor the president seeks 56 
billion less 
republicans have said for weeks that they would oppose the 
democratic package they argue that without bargaining between bush 
and congressional leaders any budget would be meaningless because 
the president would be sure to veto any cuts he opposes 
democrats predicted they had enough votes to adopt their plan 
despite qualms by some of their conservatives that the package is 
too harsh to the pentagon and lacks sufficient deficit reduction 
the grammrudman budgetbalancing law requires a maximum deficit 
next year of 64 billion under the laws procedures that would 
mean that at least 37 billion in savings must be found the 
democratic package hits that target but some lawmakers joined by 
the administration say even more savings are needed because of 
the slumping economy 
in the senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
has been unable to find enough democratic votes to adopt a spending 
plan republicans are opposing all plans offered arguing that 
negotiations between bush and congress are necessary

dry conditions and high winds fanned a brushfire 
that ravaged more than 5000 acres of everglades sawgrass and 
continued to burn uncontrollably early today park and forestry 
officials said 
lightning apparently sparked the blaze that quickly grew from 
about 60 acres monday said pat tolle spokeswoman for the 
everglades national park 
by early today the fire had burned about 3000 acres outside 
the park and about 2000 acres in the parks taylor slough area 
which consists of sawgrass wetlands and isolated stands of hardwood 
trees said forestry division duty officer phil deangelis 
its burning in some areas that havent seen fire as long as 
weve been keeping records ms tolle said 
drought conditions have left the everglades so dry that 
alligators and wading birds are traveling far from their natural 
habitats to find water most residents in central and south florida 
face water restrictions and levels in lake okeechobee which 
supplies much of the regions water have hit record lows 
no homes or park exhibits were directly threatened by the fire 
about four miles southwest of florida city but hazy smoke prompted 
the federal aviation administration to order planes not to fly 
below 2000 feet in a twosquaremile area around the fire 
firefighters from the national park service and florida division 
of forestry were battling the brushfire with help from a helicopter 
crew dumping water ms tolle said crews planned to set backfires 
overnight in an attempt to contain the blaze she said 
its a real problem fire we cant just stand back and let it 
burn itself out said forestry service duty officer john wagner 
park officials however had no immediate plans to call in 
reinforcements said ms tolle who sees some benefit in the blaze 
it has the potential to do quite a lot of good she said 
fire is essential to maintaining marsh habitat for wading birds 
and thats basically the type of habitat its burning through

on syrias role in his release i want to thank the syrian 
government for all their efforts in helping me become a free man 
on contact with the outside world during his captivity we 
had no information that was given to us about who was where where 
we are whos leaving we had no nothing we had no radio we had 
no news we had no time newsweeks to go by so we know nothing in 
fact there were times i really did not even know what month it 
was 
on his refusal of his captives offer at one point to watch 
nonnews programs on television i did not want to be entertained 
when i had lost my freedom 
on his treatment during captivity as far as the food goes 
that i had i had adequate food and fresh fruit i was given an 
opportunity to bathe shower we were given fresh clothes fairly 
regularly washed and so on 
on comments that he was blindfolded 24 hours a day during much 
of his 3year captivity i feel odd that my blindfold is not 
here 
on the fate of remaining hostages i hope godspeed that 
my colleagues that are still hostages somehow will be released

the hubble space 
telescope all 15 billion of it is back in working order today 
because a nasa engineer used a tinkertoy a lamp cord masking tape 
and glue to help solve a major problem 
the telescopes no 2 highgain antenna wedged in one position 
since last friday was free and sending data through relay 
satellites 
the national aeronautics and space administration expected 
calibration and other normal startup work to begin by tonight and 
to receive its first pictures from the telescope by next weekend 
the moral of the story is that there is no solution thats too 
humble said david skillman who built a model of the jammed 
antenna 
we were faced with a problem on the telescope that involved 
quite intricate geometry he said a number of us realized we 
could benefit greatly from a model someone suggested that even a 
tinkertoy model could be useful 
he drove to a toy store sunday afternoon and bought two boxes of 
the construction toy he got the other items in a drug store and 
put the model together in 15 minutes with another engineer john 
decker 
the telescope has two dishshaped highgain antennas that are 
designed to transmit science data to two orbiting relay satellites 
at speeds equivalent to sending the contents of a 30volume 
encyclopedia in 42 minutes 
the no 2 antenna jammed on friday when engineers were turning 
it left and right sensing something wrong and trying to prevent 
damage the telescopes computer shut down the whole system 
one engineer noticed that the inchthick electrical cable on the 
back of the antenna was slightly out of position with that in 
mind they looked at telemetry data for signs that the cable could 
interfere with the counterweights when the dish was turned to 
certain positions 
the model that skillman and decker built showed that to be the 
case and that in turn would cause the motors to work too hard and 
be automatically halted 
troubleshooters had eyed the cable as a possible problem after 
studying photographs of the telescope while it still was on the 
ground and nestled in the cargo bay of space shuttle discovery 
data from the telescope indicated the dishs position and said 
skillman when we set the model to angles in the computer screen 
we could see the interference in antenna parts and cable 
what they visualized with the model was matched with computer 
drawings at lockheed missiles and space co in california 
they didnt have the cable in them skillman said once we 
sketched in the cable they saw the interference 
armed with that knowledge computer commands were sent to the 
telescope directing exactly the way the dish should move to back 
out of its jam 
the antenna moved beautifully and easily out of its problem 
and back to normal said skillman many times a simple solution 
is the best solution 
until perhaps some day an astronaut goes to the antenna and 
bends the cable out of the way nasas solution also is a simple 
one it sent up commands to the telescopes computer ordering it to 
avoid the position where it could come in contact with the cable 
the antennas send their signal to one of two tracking and data 
relay satellites orbiting earth and store their information on tape 
recorders when they are not in communication with the satellites 
because of that said jean olivier one of the top nasa officials 
on the project the slight limits on the antennas movement to 
avoid contact with the cable will have only a small impact

in a rare revision of mormon ritual the 
church has dropped wording that required women to pledge to obey 
their husbands and portrayed the clergy of other religions as 
agents of satan 
women must now vow to obey god rather than their husbands in the 
endowment ceremony a ritual the church teaches is necessary to 
enable members to live with god after death the ceremony is 
performed only once for each person but a member may go through it 
countless times as a proxy for those who have died 
the revised ritual which took effect last month in ceremonies 
performed in the 43 temples of the church of jesus christ of 
latterday saints is being greeted with enthusiasm by church 
members who say it reflects greater sensitivity toward women and 
other religions 
the temple is an important part of my spiritual life and the 
changes have allowed me to go to the temple with renewed joy 
said lavina fielding anderson editorelect of the journal of 
mormon history 
mormons attending temple were read a statement from the 
governing first presidency informing them of the changes the 
statement said the revisions were unanimously approved by the 
threemember body and the advisory council of the twelve apostles 
bruce l olsen managing director of the churchs communications 
office said church leaders would not comment on the revisions 
because temple ceremonies are considered too sacred for public 
discussion 
but some church members praised the changes 
i think were gradually moving away from the subjugation of 
women said ross peterson coeditor of dialogue an independent 
mormon journal 
i think church leaders are developing a recognition that 
there are many highly intelligent independent capable and 
educated women in our ranks today who have a great deal to offer 
among other changes a theatrical portion of the ceremony that 
included a nonmormon preacher paid by satan to spread false 
doctrine has been excised 
the general consensus is that its a breath of fresh air 
peterson said you dont put down other churches or imply that 
they are satans children 
rebecca england a member of the planning committee of the 
independent mormon womens forum said the changes may boost temple 
attendance 
i know quite a number of mormons who stopped going to the 
temple because they found it demeaning she said and i think 
this revised ceremony addresses many of the concerns that they and 
i as a feminist mormon have had 
mormon women cannot become priests nor can they serve in the 
local lay clergy or the church hierarchy 
the mormon church based on revelations that joseph smith said 
were brought to him in the 1820s by heavenly messengers claims to 
have 73 million members with the largest concentration of church 
members in utah california and idaho 
the framework of the endowment ritual apart from editing to its 
current length of about 90 minutes and adoption of film to portray 
part of the ceremony has remained mostly intact since smiths day 
the endowment ceremony is considered a prerequisite for mormons 
goal of living with god after death in the celestial kingdom 
the highest stage of glory a church member can achieve 
the ceremony includes instruction in a theatrical setting on 
creation adam and eves expulsion from the garden of eden and 
gods plan of redemption 
members usually go through it at young adulthood before 
marriage or prior to embarking on a mission for the church it also 
is performed prior to young males receiving the melchizedek 
priesthood the churchs highest priesthood at age 19 
graphic depictions of penalties for breaking sacred covenants 
considered gruesome by some also were among the recent deletions 
its not as harsh peterson said of the new version its 
more uplifting its softer and gentler

the labor unrest is the most serious since 1987 when workers 
frustrated by years of repression and low wages and encouraged by 
democratic reforms shut down scores of major industries and won 
wage increases of about 50 percent 
however many workers still live in substandard housing and 
receive low pay and union activists are now seeking not merely 
higher wages by more power for unions

members the board of directors of the embattled covenant house 
program for runaway youths is trying to reassure donors that the 
charity will endure

with shelter residents and loaned charity funds to two former board 
members 
covenant house provides shelter for 25000 runaway youths in the 
us canada and central america 
the shelters board is investigating all the recent allegations 
reassessing program needs improving management practices and 
trying to solicit donations officials said

brother to replace ritter who is believed to be living in 
seclusion in new jersey

joined and three seats remain vacant 
board chairman ralph a pfeiffer said that the board generally 
left business up to ritters judgment 
we wish we had done more and known more said pfeiffer a 
former chairman of ibm world trade but were on the right track

fighting mounting political and labor 
turmoil president violeta barrios de chamorro is promising to 
replace the longtime sandinista military chief soon and open talks 
to disarm contra rebels 
the leader of the new usbacked government also said monday 
she is disbanding the secret police which the leftist sandinistas 
had controlled 
mrs chamorro speaking at her first news conference since she 
took office last week also gave an idea of the economic 
difficulties she faces 
she said the sandinistas had left just 3 million in the 
treasury and an 11 billion foreign debt 
that is why it is urgent that we apply severe measures that 
will allow us in the short term to stabilize the currency and 
prices to guarantee investment and the productive effort now that 
this years agricultural cycle is starting she said 
last week mrs chamorro devalued nicaraguas cordoba by about 
half the devaluation sharply increased prices causing more 
hardship in an already poor country 
mrs chamorro on wednesday succeeded daniel ortega after a 
decade of sandinista rule and nine years of war with usbacked 
contras rebels 
on monday she said she would pursue reform as soon as possible 
and appealed for support from both friends and foes 
her shaky new government faced new challenges today with two 
labor groups planning separate protests to mark international labor 
day 
a sandinista union has organized a protest to back demands for 
100 percent pay raises for all workers and the disbanding of contra 
rebels four antisandinista unions were to rally to demand the 
removal of gen humberto ortega as the armed forces chief 
at her news conference monday the president promised that 
ortega the brother of the former president will remain only 
temporarily as chief of the armed forces 
she also said she would hold talks wednesday with contra 
military chief israel galeano to ask him to disarm his forces 
mrs chamorros decision to serve as her own defense minister 
and keep ortega as commander split her own 14party united national 
opposition which she led to a landslide victory in elections feb 
25 
the contras promised to surrender their weapons and disband by 
june 10 then balked after mrs chamorro announced that gen ortega 
would remain military chief they say they want an end to 
sandinista control of the military and police 
at her news conference mrs chamorro said she understood how 
her supporters would like a drastic and immediate change in the 
armed forces but she added we need to do things well even if 
it means resuming temporary sacrifices to guarantee the tranquility 
and stability of the country 
she repeated that she had told gen ortega several times his job 
was temporary and she explained she kept him on to ensure the 
unity and discipline of the army while the contras disarm 
she announced that the powerful secret police force which was 
run by the sandinista interior ministry is being disbanded but 
she did not go into details 
she also said she was ending the use of exit visas which the 
sandinistas required that both nicaraguans and foreigners obtain to 
leave the country 
mrs chamorro further appealed to her vice president virgilio 
godoy to remain loyal he is engaged in a bitter power struggle 
with some of her close advisers on monday he was on an 
unexplained trip out of the country 
i trust that the vice president will accompany and support 
me with the total loyalty in the making of the great decisions and 
in the fulfillment of the complex tasks with which the people of 
nicaragua have entrusted us she said

maverick soviet reformer boris yeltsin 
was in good condition today after undergoing surgery for a slipped 
disc the doctor who performed the operation said 
his prognosis is frankly very good and we believe his recovery 
will be total although he will have to remain in hospital for 
three to five days dr josep llobet tapies of barcelona hospital 
said at a news conference 
yeltsin a member of the soviet congress of peoples deputies 
and a leading populist reformer arrived in barcelona late sunday 
to take part in a television debate 
on monday he canceled all activities after complaining of back 
pains 
the doctor said yeltsin came out of surgery awake and in good 
humor joking with medical staff 
he said delaying surgery would have risked paralysis of 
yeltsins right foot upon learning this the soviet deputy 
exclaimed go ahead and operate a future president of the soviet 
union cannot have a paralyzed foot llobet tapies said 
yeltsin who is seeking the presidency of the russian republic 
began to gather mass support in 1987 when he spoke out against what 
he considered the slow pace of president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms 
the criticism cost him his post as moscow communist party chief 
but he reemerged triumphant in march 1989 with election to the 
congress this spring he won election to the legislature of the 
russian republic

gov william a oneill has signed into 
law a bill designed to guarantee women access to legal abortions 
even if the us supreme court overturns its 1973 landmark roe vs 
wade decision 
the law effective oct 1 repeals the states unenforced 
criminal antiabortion statutes requires girls under 16 to get 
counseling before getting an abortion and encourages them to tell 
their parents 
oneill a roman catholic who has said he personally opposes 
abortion said the law strikes a balance between a persons right 
to privacy and state interests 
the connecticut law allows abortions late in pregnancy when the 
fetus is capable of living outside the womb only when the life or 
health of the mother is in danger 
it recognizes a right to choice by women the law also 
recognizes the state has an interest in fetus viability and 
properly recognizes that minors should be counseled before making 
the very difficult decision to abort a pregnancy oneill said in 
a statement 
the states leading antiabortion group the prolife council of 
connecticut lauded the law because of provisions on counseling and 
fetus viability 
this whole thing for us has been a major breakthrough because 
before we had nothing said regina smith the executive director 
of the council 
more strident abortion opponents have been critical of the bill 
prolife not only didnt get anything we are in a far worse 
position than we were before said republican state rep anthony 
nania who voted against the measure and has called for smiths 
ouster 
the bill cleared the state senate on friday on a vote of 323 
the house approved the bill the week before on a vote of 13612 
the measure has been described as the most aggressive 
abortionrights piece of legislation since the supreme courts 
decision last summer in a missouri case webster vs reproductive 
health services gave states greater power to restrict abortions 
connecticuts antiabortion laws were rendered unenforceable by 
roe vs wade they carried penalties of up to five years in prison 
and a 1000 fine for anyone performing an abortion and two years 
in prison and a 500 fine for women getting abortions except to 
protect the life of the woman 
oneill was named briefly last summer to a political hit list of 
antiabortion politicians compiled by the national abortion rights 
action league the group quickly took him off the list after 
learning that he did not favor significant restrictions on abortion 
the organizations kate michelman called the measure a 
fantastic bill 
the passage of this bill absolutely guarantees women of 
connecticut the right to choose she said 
new hampshire gov judd gregg vetoed a similar bill earlier this 
year describing it as too liberal

exxon corp assembled summer cleanup 
crews to return to the soiled shores of prince william sound today 
with no word on whether they may use chemicals that encourage 
oileating bacteria 
workers will stop short of using fertilizers until alaska and 
coast guard officials decide whether they should be allowed 
some state officials worry the chemicals in the fertilizers 
could be toxic alaska can veto their use but authority for the 
rest of exxons cleanup lies with coast guard rear adm david e 
ciancaglini who has approved parts of the plan 
state officials hoped to decide today or wednesday on the 
fertilizers used in a cleanup method called bioremediation said 
mike hilley of the alaska department of environmental conservation 
the cleanup from exxons march 1989 spill of nearly 11 million 
gallons of north slope crude was suspended last september and 
officials monitored conditions through winter 
the spill was the nations largest and coated hundreds of miles 
of shoreline killing hundreds of otters and thousands of birds and 
other animals 
exxon proposed sending eight mobile crews to clean shoreline 
still soiled from the spill three of the vessels already are at 
work in the sound and the gulf of alaska exxon spokesman fred 
davis said two more ships were to be launched today and the rest 
later in the week 
exxon plans to employ about 1100 people for the summer cleanup 
effort about onetenth the number it used last summer 
while the bioremediation debate continues crews today were to 
begin manual pickup and raking at the most environmentally 
sensitive shorelines ciancaglini said 
top priority will be sites considered important for commercial 
fishing and and recreation officials said 
ciancaglini has approved less controversial portions of the oil 
companys cleanup plan and said he hoped to make a final ruling on 
the rest by may 9 
exxon has said its studies of 574 miles of shoreline so far 
showed twothirds without any oil at all 22 percent with very 
light oiling and 13 percent with a narrow to wide band of 
weathered crude along sections 
the alaska department of environmental conservation said 79 
percent of the shoreline sites affected by the spill still had oil

centenarian henry stenhouse is running 
for congress after watching the country disintegrate during his 
lifetime 
in some respects youve gotta be a little bit off base to want 
to do anything for this country said the 100yearold eye 
doctor making his first electoral bid but doggone it god has 
saved me for something i feel like its an obligation 
early april found the ophthalmologist up to his elbows in 
correspondence he was trying to reach all the registered 
republicans in the 3rd congressional district in time for the may 8 
primary against two opponents 
this is the doggonedest thing he said with a sigh i 
dont think well get it all done i didnt dream that there was as 
many people registered republicans weve got pages and pages 
boxes full of them i dont think were half through 
when stenhouse filed for congress he was the lone republican in 
the race despite the longshot odds of winning stenhouse said he 
isnt worried about competing with two primary opponents who 
emerged later businessman don davis 60 and oil heater repairman 
ken brosman 39 
the winner will face democratic rep martin lancaster who is 
seeking a third term in a district that hasnt had a gop 
congressman since reconstruction 
stenhouses suit is wellworn his tie threadbare and his 
shoulders stooped but he holds his head erect and his pale blue 
eyes constantly dart about he shuns the seat belt in his car as 
another example of too damned much government 
his plaform 
hes opposed to welfare wants to rewrite the us tax code to 
levy a flat tax on everyone and expects women to stay home if they 
have children instead of putting them in subsidized day care 
the children of this country to start with they dont get 
discipline their homes are broken up he said and here we are 
paying women to breed and that is absolutely out for me 
stenhouse said children were not always neglected 
in a lifetime i have seen this country disintegrate he 
said when i got home from school my momma was there waiting for 
me id say well momma id like to go play and shed say 
all right go for half an hour what kind of trouble can you get 
in in a half hour 
aside from mailing fliers stenhouse does little campaigning 
he thought about taking a poll but in the confusion of all 
this i forgot it 
he also spurned an opportunity to address a church congregation 
they asked me to make a speech but i said no way i dont work 
on sunday 
yet the campaign has taken on a sense of destiny for stenhouse 
who hopes to shake up an entrenched congress you cant do it in 
a year you cant do it in a lifetime but i think we ought to 
start to pull in the reins he said 
and if he loses 
if i dont win i dont know what ill do he said maybe 
sit around this house huh but ive got a farm and that is enough 
to keep me busy

a pale but energetic frank reed 
the second american hostage freed in nine days checked into a us 
military hospital today and celebrated the end of his captivity 
with a beer and a large steak 
doctors said the 57yearold educator who said he was kept 
blindfolded for much of his 3year ordeal was weak and tired 
but otherwise feeling well and was reunited with his wife and 
9yearold son 
reed blew kisses waved and kissed his hand and touched the 
ground after arriving in brilliant sunny weather at nearby 
rheinmain air base from syria on a us air force c141 transport 
plane 
he stepped off the plane looking sprightly and waving the v 
for victory sign but looked tired after arriving by helicopter at 
the hospital for the medical tests and debriefing that have become 
a rite for freed hostages 
reed was released monday night into syrian hands in west beirut 
just as robert polhill was last week there was no doubt that iran 
which backs the shiite moslem fundamentalist hostagetakers had 
again played a role 
the whitebearded former captive was driven to the syrian 
capital of damascus where he described a lonely and boring 
ordeal in which he was treated reasonably well but kept ignorant of 
his fate 
wed know nothing reed told a crowded news conference in 
damascus we had no radio we had no news we had no time no 
newsweek to go by in fact there were times when i did not even 
know what month it was 
the remarks implied that reed who was kidnapped sept 9 1986 
was held with other hostages but he would not elaborate 
in washington president bush thanked syria and iran for their 
help 
he encouraged them to help free the six americans among 16 
westerners still believed held in lebanon by proiranian shiite 
moslem fundamentalists saying that only then can those countries 
expect normalized relations with washington 
a leading iranian newspaper the tehran times said today that 
irans leaders expect a reciprocal gesture of good will from 
washington if another hostage is to be freed that sentiment was 
echoed in damascus by syrias foreign minister farouk alsharaa 
bush said he would not object if israel were to release shiite 
prisoners as the lebanese kidnappers have demanded 
in a statement issued four hours after his arrival at the air 
force hospital doctors said reed had lost significant weight and 
muscle mass from a lack of exercise and a marginal diet during 
his captivity it said he was also weak and tired but 
otherwise feels well 
it said a preliminary examination in damascus found no major 
medical problems adding that reed would probably be at the 
hospital for two or three days and did not wish to meet with 
reporters today 
reed was reunited with his syrian moslem wife fahima 39 and 
their son tarek who had arrived from the united states where 
they had been staying in his hometown of malden mass 
he asked for a heineken beer and a large steak cooked medium 
rare and got what he asked for the statement said 
the freed hostage who had been principal of a private school in 
beirut since 1977 was to undergo further medical tests as well as 
questioning by a special state department team 
before leaving syria reed told state television that he was 
blindfolded 24 hours a day during much of his captivity 
i feel odd that my blindfold is not here he said in a husky 
voice touching his face 
reeds kidnappers who called themselves the organization of the 
islamic dawn in a sunday announcing that reed would be released 
had said he would carry a message to the us government 
the freed hostage would not comment on the message 
polhills former captors had said he would also be carrying a 
message and polhill delivered that undisclosed message to bush 
personally on monday about the time of reeds release polhill was 
the first american hostage to be freed in lebanon since november 
1986 
reed said he hoped the other hostages will be freed soon 
constantly using the plural to describe conditions of his captivity 
he said he had adequate food and fresh fruit and that we were 
given fresh clothes fairly regularly washed and so on 
our problem was the passage of endless time we were given 
lots of books and allowed to watch tv but never the news 
however he said i refused the books and tv i didnt want to 
be entertained when i lost my freedom 
he said on tv of his captivity it was lonely it was boring 
reed spoke haltingly at times his eyes downcast i havent 
talked much as a hostage he explained 
the tehran times which often reflects the thinking of iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani said today that iran and the 
militants in lebanon now expect washington and its allies to 
pressure israel into releasing a significant number of 
detainees specifically sheik abdulkarim obeid 
obeid is a shiite cleric with the proiranian group hezbollah 
he was abducted by israel from south lebanon on july 28 1989 
the proiranian hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for 
factions holding most of the hostages in lebanon 
the longestheld hostage is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
arriving at the wiesbaden hospital reed gave the thumbsup 
sign and smiled to reporters waving with both hands 
enthusiastically to about 170 military and medical personnel 
gathered on hospital balconies 
welcome back to the free world said one banner outside the 
hospital

the school board weighed jobs with junk food 
and voted on the side of potato chips and pop 
the los angeles unified school district decided unanimously 
monday to end a 10yearold ban on junk food as a way to counter 
cuts in federal food subsidies 
im ashamed of what happened tonight but we really dont have 
a choice board member roberta weintraub said after vote its 
a question of jobs versus junk food 
a 10 million deficit in the districts cafeteria fund and the 
prospect of laying off more than 100 cafeteria workers prompted an 
end to the ban officials said 
the school board hopes several million dollars a year will be 
generated through the sale of junk food in school cafeterias also 
lunch prices will be increased by 10 cents for some elementary 
students and 25 cents for some junior high and high school students 
to increase revenue 
the price increases will not affect the estimated 80 percent of 
the districts students who come from low income families and 
qualify for free or reduced price meals 
school board members said a policy that allowed studentrun 
stores on campuses to sell snacks undercut the cafeteria ban 
that destroyed our junk food policy ms weintraub said 
when kids could walk down the hall and buy candy and coke during 
lunch time we couldnt keep them in the cafeteria

eastern europe quietly celebrated its 
liberation from decades of communist ritual on may day 
substituting music festivals and picnics for the proletarian 
parades of the past 
in moscow a brief burst of the popular rage that swept 
communist leaders from power across eastern europe erupted in red 
square where the traditional parade was open to all for the first 
time in decades 
columns of demonstrators taunted soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and other top leaders with cries of shame they 
unfurled yellow red and green lithuanian flags and shouted 
antikremlin slogans 
with their stalinist leaders already overthrown thanks in part 
to gorbachevs reforms east europeans rejoiced peacefully in their 
new freedom to mark may day as they wish 
in budapest thousands of people turned out for a giant trade 
union picnic in the citys biggest park in prague where the 
shortlived joy of the prague spring reforms produced a raucous 
may day parade in 1968 crowds gathered to welcome back us 
activist allen ginsberg crowned unofficial king of the festivities 
22 years ago but then expelled by the communists 
ginsberg arrived in prague a few days ago to return his 1968 
crown and enjoy a rock fest that also will be briefly addressed by 
president vaclav havel 
romanians continued a 10day protest in bucharest calling for 
the resignation of interim president ion iliescu because of his 
communist past they prepared for rallies in at least two other 
cities 
despite its association with communist rule the may day holiday 
has deep popular roots across much of eastern europe where strong 
socialist traditions predate stalinism 
the meaning of may day changed in step with history polish 
president wojciech jaruzelski noted in a statement but the 
tradition of a workers celebration of this day has been deeply 
rooted in our polish customs 
even western countries such as france still celebrate may 
day romanian government spokesman cristian unteanu noted when 
asked why the holiday was not abandoned its a perfectly normal 
holiday 
the common traditions of western and eastern europe found 
symbolic expression in may day celebrations in west berlin where a 
crowd of 60000 outside city hall included thousands of east 
berliners who came through the brandenburg gate 
communist parties were reduced to a minor role in the 
festivities 
in czechoslovakia where the communist party still claims more 
than 1 million members leader vasil mohorita told a rally of some 
20000 people the party hoped for more than 10 percent of the votes 
in next months democratic elections 
hungarys communists roundly defeated at the polls last month 
ran a single beer stand at the city picnic that marked the 100th 
anniversary of a demonstration for an eighthour work day that 
still eludes many hungarians who often work two or three jobs to 
make ends meet 
tiny isolated albania was the only country to see more orthodox 
celebrations 
the state news agency ata quoted communist leader ramiz alia as 
reiterating his refusal to follow the reforms of the east europeans 
they are heading into a blind alley he reportedly told a 
workers rally they are jumping out of the frying pan into the 
fire 
in china which unlike other communist countries never had a 
tradition of giant may day parades a holiday mood prevailed in 
beijing 
but an armed police cordon around tiananmen squares monument to 
revolutionary heroes reflected official determination to avoid any 
repeat of the prodemocracy demonstrations that spread from there 
last spring to much of the country before being brutally 
suppressed 
elsewhere in asia hundreds of thousands of japanese workers 
gathered at may day rallies and heard promises of shorter working 
hours in the philippines at least 24000 people rallied near the 
us embassy in a rally called by militant labor groups to protest 
us military bases in the country

released from a clinic nearly a week after he underwent surgery to 
remove a malignant brain tumor a hospital spokeswoman said 
maher 74 was in good spirits upon his release monday from 
scripps clinic in la jolla scripps spokeswoman sue pondrom said 
in a prepared statement maher said he believed an outpouring of 
prayers in his behalf helped him in a miraculous recovery 
maher was admitted to the hospital april 23 after complaining of 
vision problems and a loss of equilibrium he underwent surgery 
april 25

of secessionist lithuania and shouted shame at the leaders 
who were standing atop lenins mausoleum 
gorbachev and other officials on the reviewing stand left after 
enduring the unofficial demonstrations for about 20 minutes some 
protesters booed and jeered as the leaders left and shouted 
resign festive music blared through loudspeakers around the 
square making the shouting only barely audible 
it was not clear whether gorbachev and the others left because 
of the huge outpouring of criticism unprecedented on red square 
even in the countrys tense political atmosphere 
during the protest gorbachev appeared impassive but was seen 
tapping his fingers on the parapet of the reviewing stand as he 
often does when he is impatient 
for decades the red square rally on may day has been an 
orchestrated show of support for official policies 
a subway worker attending the parade as an official guest said 
he was stunned 
a revolution is a revolution what else can i say said the 
worker who identified himself only as yuri 
at least one marcher today carried the soviet flag with the 
hammer and sickle cut out another sign called soviet leaders the 
kremlin ceausescus after the executed romanian dictator others 
said down with the empire of red fascism and today a 
blockade of lithuania tomorrow a blockade of moscow 
the protest was not shown on staterun television which ended 
its transmissions after the official march 
the wave of angry protesters continued to file through red 
square which holds about 50000 at a time for more than an hour 
after the leaders left police gradually and apparently gently 
moved them along a few thousand trekked about a mile to a square 
across from gorky park to renew their demonstration 
similar expressions of discontent were seen in leningrad the 
soviet unions second largest city and the birthplace of the 
revolution protesters sprinkled among progovernment marchers on 
palace square carried banners that read communism is a universal 
shame and freedom for lithuania according to leningrad 
journalist maxim korzhov 
some demonstrators he said shouted gorbachev resign 
soviets are upset with gorbachev because of the deteriorating 
state of the economy consumer goods are scarce and of poor quality 
they also are critical of him for championing democratic reforms 
but not submitting his own leadership to a test at the polls 
gorbachev was elected by lawmakers last month to a powerfully 
expanded executive presidency and critics say it puts a dangerous 
amount of power into the hands of a single leader 
the 59yearold soviet leader is also engaged in a bitter 
dispute with lithuania over its independence drive and moscow has 
imposed a blockade on many raw materials manufactured goods and 
food 
many soviet adherents of democracy say gorbachev should let the 
lithuanians restore the sovereignty they lost in 1940 when the 
soviet union forcibly annexed the baltic state 
gorbachev and the leadership were not immune from criticism 
during the official segment that came before the protest 
labor leaders speaking from atop lenins mausoleum demanded 
attention to their worries that economic reforms will lead to high 
prices and unemployment 
the may day celebration a major soviet holiday comes as the 
country faces secessionist demands in several of its 15 republics 
and economic deterioration government statistics show industrial 
production to have fallen by 12 percent in the first quarter one 
any given day during the period 130000 people were on strike 
the basic reason for the crisis situation is that the 
leadership of the party and the government have been chronically 
late in putting into effect cardinal political and economic 
measures said yevgeny kablov a technology researcher chosen to 
speak to a 30minute rally before the traditional parade 
yevgeny kuznetsov a union leader at the citys giant hammer and 
sickle steel mill said planned moves to a market economy would 
hurt workers 
many wise men of economics are calling us to plunge headlong 
into a market economy trusting in our luck he said but we 
wont be able to trust our luck if we dont beforehand take into 
account the consequences growth in prices a fall in the standard 
of living and unemployment 
the speeches from the mausoleum were met with less than 
enthusiastic applause 
gorbachev led government and communist party politburo leaders 
onto the reviewing stand before the proceedings in keeping with 
efforts to emphasize the government over the party he was 
accompanied by premier nikolai i ryzhkov and anatoly i lukyanov 
chairman of the supreme soviet legislature 
neither gorbachev nor any other member of the party or 
government leadership on the reviewing stand spoke at the rally 
also on the stand was newly elected moscow mayor gavriil popov 
a reformminded economist highly critical of gorbachev 
popovs supporters on the city council are pushing to turn much 
of the capitals retail trade into private hands 
gorbachev and his advisers began meeting a month ago to plan 
economic reforms that are expected to include the most radical 
economic reforms attempted in the soviet leaders more than five 
years in power 
but gorbachevs economic advisers acknowledge they can proceed 
with reforms only as fast as beleaguered consumers will permit

a plastics plant fire forced evacuation of 
about 2000 people after an emergency fire plan burned and left 
officials unsure of what to do the sheriff says 
nearby residents were allowed to return home once tests found 
the air safe following the fire monday at the lifelike plastics 
plant 
the blaze produced a cloud of black toxic smoke that could be 
seen 12 miles away officials said the smoke forced the evacuation 
of 1400 ozark public school students a nursing home and 350 
students at a vocationaltechnical school 
franklin county sheriff gordon mccain said the cause of the fire 
was not known the fire destroyed the plant and the damage was 
expected to run into the millions of dollars he said there were 
no injuries 
the plant made polystyrene packaging materials plant manager 
gary key said he said some of the products are made of pentane 
gas the material that most concerned emergency workers 
this stuff is not real toxic mccain said at first they 
thought it was what happened is the records of what to do in case 
of fire were in the plant and they burned up they ended up not 
knowing what to do 
state police spokesman mack hayden said officials contacted arco 
chemical co of newtown square pa for information about 
polystyrene which the chemical company manufactures 
officials were told that polystyrene was the main concern in the 
fire hayden said adding the polystyrene poses slight inhalation 
problems eye irritation and skin irritation 
the ozark fire department and a hazardous materials team from 
fort chaffee entered the ruins of the firegutted plant monday 
afternoon wearing air masks hayden said they erected a dike to 
stop molten chemicals from running out of the 52000squarefoot 
plant and into nearby gar creek officials said

bethlehem has become the latest city to 
require high school students to perform community service in order 
to graduate 
the school board voted 63 monday to require the class of 1994 
to perform 60 hours of community service after school on weekends 
and in the summer 
at the meeting school board president joseph mccarthy said the 
proposal was poorly thought out 
but board member robert thompson said the measure would 
encourage students to have an active concern for the community 
with the coming generation of adults we need to enunciate 
clearly a new set of values in contradiction to the consumer ideal 
of happiness and fulfillment thompson said 
in approving the requirement bethlehem followed the lead of a 
growing number of cities that have adopted some form of community 
service standard in the past several years 
in 1983 the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching 
issued a report calling for students to perform at least 120 hours 
of community service during their four years in high school

seven years in prison for shooting a black motorist to death and 
the victims sister said she was satistifed with the outcome of the 
racially charged case 
alex gonzales 25 was sentenced monday in the oct 31 killing 
of ida lee delaney a 50yearold newspaper janitor he was 
convicted friday of voluntary manslaughter and could have faced up 
to 20 years in prison 
janice myles ms delaneys sister said she was pleased with 
the sentence but she said gonzales is still better off than her 
sister 
you know shes gone ms myles said the only thing i can 
do is go talk to her at her grave but they can go visit him 
mike howard president of the houston police patrolmans union 
said he was disgusted by the jurys verdict 
its an indictment on the whole police department howard 
said the line has been drawn and were going to fight this 
gonzales attorney mike hinton said this is not good for 
offduty officers to now be thinking that they can be confronted 
with the sort of ordeal that alex gonzales encountered 
gonzales who is free on bond will appeal the verdict 
he and fellow offduty officers robert gonzales who is 
unrelated and alexander romero were returning from a birthday 
celebration when they encountered ms delaney on a freeway about 
530 am they said ms delaney cut in front of their unmarked car 
and later fired shots at them 
during a 12mile chase ms delaney pulled her truck over to the 
side of the road near a highway department vehicle apparently 
seeking help 
she fired at gonzales after he ran to her truck gun in hand 
and punched her in the face a road maintenance worker testified 
critically wounded he returned gunfire killing her 
gonzales was intoxicated at the time of the shooting tests 
showed he had a bloodalcohol level of 19 nearly twice the amount 
to be considered legally drunk in texas 
the case sparked protests from blacks and other community 
leaders both in houston and in dallas who said they did not think 
an allwhite jury would convict gonzales 
charlotte ragsdale a member of the ida delaney justice 
committee said the sentence is at least a step in dallas 
obviously there was enough information and evidence to bring 
some form of justice and that was critical in my opinion ms 
ragsdale said the family was looking for hope in the system in 
they were able to find it

the dalai lama said today that chinas 
lifting of martial law in his homeland was a public relations 
exercise 
in a statement issued by his new delhi office the tibetan 
spiritual leader said the problems of tibet will never be resolved 
through intimidation and superficial changes he called for a 
fundamental change in how chinese leaders view tibet 
china imposed martial law in the tibetan capital of lhasa on 
march 8 1989 after three days of antichinese rioting the 
government claimed 16 people died but tibetan and western 
travelers said about 30 were killed 
the rioting marked the fourth time since 1987 that communist 
chinese security forces moved to crush antichinese uprisings 
the dalai lama who won the 1989 nobel peace prize for his 
advocacy of peaceful resistance in tibet said the lifing of the 
martial law monday was a public relations exercise in view of the 
growing international criticism of china 
he said that over the weekend a large public trial was held in 
lhasa quoting an official radio lhasa report he said 43 tibetans 
were publicly tried and sentenced on vague criminal charges he 
claimed the trial was conducted to intimidate tibetans before the 
lifting of martial law 
human rights agencies including the londonbased amnesty 
international and the usbased asia watch have condemned china 
for alleged human rights abuses in tibet china has been accused of 
torturing tibetans and denying them basic rights such as that of 
free assembly and religion 
countries have limited themselves to urging restraint on the 
chinese because all of them back chinas claims to sovereignty over 
the vast himalayan region 
many tibetans resent chinese rule and reject chinas claims that 
tibet has been part of china since the 13th century 
the dalai lama who fled to india after an aborted uprising in 
1959 has called for an autonomous tibet where beijing would still 
control defense and foreign relations 
china has rejected the proposal saying the dalai lama is trying 
to subvert national unity 
in his statement the dalai lama urged beijing to negotiate with 
tibetans on the future of tibet

thousands of east germans marked their first 
free may day with protests against the widespread joblessness they 
fear will be the price of unification with west germany 
border guards dispensed with passport checks as crowds of people 
carrying balloons beer and bratwurst swarmed back and forth 
through new openings in the berlin wall 
nearly 60000 germans from both sides of the border crowded 
around the reichstag the former parliament building on the west 
german side of the wall they heard speakers demand employment and 
social service protection as east germany moves from a socialist 
economy to the free market 
economists have predicted that 500000 to 2 million east germans 
could lose their jobs as inefficient stateowned enterprises are 
closed and others are forced to compete with western businesses 
but west germans as well have expressed fears about the economic 
impact of unification 
unemployment will be bad in both countries as factories close 
in the east the east germans will come here and compete for jobs 
with west germans said claudia gerlach a 27yearold west 
berliner 
west german labor leaders meanwhile warned that western 
businesses may seek to move to the east to take advantage of lower 
wages 
while some germans rallied against unemployment hundreds of 
thousands of others enjoyed the warm spring day at a huge may day 
festival on east berlins main avenue unter den linden 
only a few thousand gathered in another part of town for a rally 
held by the former communist party a retooled group now calling 
for democratic socialism 
thousands of extra police were put on duty in both east and west 
berlin to guard against the rampages by radicals and hooligans that 
occur annually in west berlin on may day evening with the newly 
opened borders authorities feared the mayhem would spread to the 
east 
no violence was reported 
may day rallies were held in cities in both germanys with calls 
for job protection the central theme of each gathering

scientists using a robot diver to 
explore two war of 1812era wrecks let schoolchildren across north 
america in on the expedition 
the underwater look monday at the merchant schooner hamilton and 
its sister ship the scourge was televised live to 13 museums 
four youngsters watching got to operate the robot using a computer 
joystick hooked up by satellite 
the cold fresh water of lake ontario and the 300foot depth of 
the wrecks helped preserve the two ships which were pressed into 
battle service by the united states during the war of 1812 
cannons railings and an elegantly carved figurehead could be 
seen as the blackandwhite television image panned slowly 
robert d ballard the expeditions leader and other scientists 
gave a running narration and took questions from viewers at the 
museums in the united states and canada and at the canadian 
football hall of fame in hamilton a city 25 miles west of st 
catharines that has title to the wrecks 
the ship is in immaculate condition we can see the caulking 
in the planks ballard said theres no suggestion that they 
suffered any damage due to the sinking itself they just got 
flooded and went down very gently 
the hamilton and the scourge sank during a storm aug 8 1813 
killing 53 sailors they had taken part in several battles against 
british forces in southern canada 
however the wrecks narrowly escaped damage from large ships 
that dragged their anchors across the lake bottom ballard said he 
said the furrows caused by the anchors were plainly visible near 
the wrecks 
the wrecks remained undisturbed six miles off st catharines 30 
miles south of toronto on the lakes southern shore until their 
discovery in 1975 since then scientists such as french underwater 
explorer jacques cousteau have used submarines and remote cameras 
to explore them but ballards expedition was the most 
technologically sophisticated yet 
in an interview by shiptoshore telephone ballard said the 
childrens participation was the most significant part of the 
program he said the remote control setup had never been used 
before 
ballard said the twoweek expedition would produce a detailed 
map of the wrecks that hamilton officials could use in deciding 
whether to raise them someday 
ballard director of the center for marine exploration at the 
woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts led the 1985 
expedition that discovered the wreck of the titanic the storied 
ocean liner sank in the north atlantic after ramming an iceberg in 
1912

down the thermostat to slow decomposition of the bodies paid all 
his bills cashed all his checks and left a note for the milkman 
telling him he wouldnt be needed for a while

his mother when she asked what the noise was and then each child 
as they returned from school he left a note for his pastor and

mentally deficient at the time a product of a strict lutheran 
upbringing with the values and ethics of the 19th century 
list had written to his pastor that he killed the family out of 
fear for their souls and out of economic distress 
his attorney told jurors that on the day list killed his family 
he entered hell with his eyes open 
defense attorney elijah miller wanted wertheimer to allow the 
64yearold list to serve any sentences simultaneously 
miller said another option would be for wertheimer to sentence 
list to life imprisonment on just one of the five murder 
convictions 
under penalties in place when list killed his family in 1971 
the maximum sentence for list is five consecutive life sentences 
which will keep him in jail for the rest of his life 
if he had been sentenced to five concurrent life terms however 
he would be eligible for parole in 14 years 11 months

armed jewish settlers honored a supreme court 
deadline today and left the compound they occupied for almost three 
weeks in the christian quarter of jerusalems walled old city 
a district court judge meanwhile sentenced settler leader 
rabbi moshe levinger to five months in prison for killing a 
palestinian 
levinger shot and killed kayed hassan salah 42 on sept 30 
1988 he was initially charged with manslaughter which carries a 
maximum jail term of 20 years as part of a plea bargain he 
admitted to the lesser charge of causing death by negligence 
salah a shoestore owner was standing at the entrance to his 
shop when he was shot during a stonethrowing incident in the west 
bank town of hebron 
at least 29 palestinians have been slain by settlers since the 
start of the uprising nearly 29 months ago according to israeli 
human rights advocates besides levinger only one other settler 
has been sentenced to jail 
in the christian quarter after heated arguments between 
settlers and clergymen a sixmember church delegation was allowed 
to inspect the complex to confirm that all the settlers who were 
supposed to leave had done so 
they evacuated the settlement except for 20 people said 
avraham sochovolsky an attorney for the greek orthodox church 
which owns the 72room complex near the church of the holy 
sepulcher 
the 20 israelis who stayed after the noon deadline were acting 
as caretakers for the panamabased sbc company which holds the 
lease that the church contends is invalid the supreme court ruled 
last thursday that 20 of the 150 settlers could stay pending 
settlement of the tenancy dispute 
the settlement in the fourbuilding st johns hospice provoked 
outcry from church groups washington and other governments when it 
was established april 11 it also fueled protest among 
palestinians both christian and moslem 
the old city is divided into zealously guarded christian 
moslem jewish and armenian quarters and the slightest changes 
have historically resulted in conflict 
in the past few days reporters and photographers saw settlers 
leave the building in small groups apparently to avoid a mass 
exit that would look like a retreat 
earlier today the settlers turned back a halfdozen priests who 
tried to enter the compound to confirm the evacuation claim and 
also barred reporters 
dan aviyitzhak a lawyer for the 50 families who took over the 
building during easter week celebrations said the settlers also 
gave a declaration to police that they had left the building 
shmuel eviatar a settler spokesman read a statement as bells 
from the church of the holy sepulcher and other nearby churches 
pealed loudly 
no there is no feeling of failure eviatar insisted 
honor for the court and a desire to fulfill not only the 
letter but the spirit of the law have led us to maintain only 20 
tenants in the building holding the keys 
minutes after the noon deadline expired a halfdozen bearded 
clergymen dressed in black cloaks came to the settlement and 
engaged in a 10minute shouting match with the settlers spokesman 
informed that the settlers had left they pointed to a woman who 
could be seen through a window inside the building settlers said 
she was a cook 
on friday christian clergy closed holy sites throughout the 
holy land to protest the settlement 
there have also been protests from the united states greece and 
arab countries over the move into the old city which was captured 
from jordan in the 1967 middle east war and annexed by israel 
the settlers had sublet the property from an armenian christian 
they argued jews should be allowed to live anywhere especially in 
the capital of the jewish state 
the move into the christian quarter was seen as part of a 
broader campaign by rightwingers to push new settlement activity 
in the israelioccupied lands taking advantage of a political 
vacuum 
on march 15 the labor party left the government led by prime 
minister yitzhak shamir in a dispute over us peace proposals 
shamir now leads the caretaker government and is trying to form a 
cabinet 
the us government has criticized settlements as an obstacle to 
peace

a former playboy model accused of evading 
taxes on money she received for having sex with an elderly 
millionaire was a kept woman a former accountant who prepared 
her tax returns said today 
prosecutors say lynnette harris 35 and her twin sister 
accepted more than 1 million in cash and goods from businessman 
david kritzik of suburban shorewood he died last year at age 89 
her sister leigh ann conley of milwaukee is charged with four 
counts of failing to file federal income tax returns in the same 
alleged scheme she is scheduled to stand trial in june 
the government alleged the money was paid in exchange for sex 
dennis coffey ms harris attorney said kritzik gave the money as 
gifts 
former accountant william g domer who now operates a wholesale 
bakery said he met ms harris in february 1985 when she consulted 
with him about her taxes showing him four 1983 checks from kritzik 
totaling 100000 and 1984 checks totaling 25000 to 30000 
the 1983 checks were not reported to the internal revenue 
service as income domer said 
i had assumed and i had a conversation with mr kritzik that 
led me to feel those amounts were a gift he said 
domer said ms harris told him the money was for a facial 
reconstruction she underwent in california 
the 1984 checks were listed on ms harriss tax return as 
other income domer said he said he had no reason to think the 
checks in 1984 were gifts 
when asked what he thought of ms harris relationship with 
kritzik domer said the word kept pops into my mind 
before ms harris jury was selected monday us district judge 
thomas curran rejected an internal revenue service affidavit in 
which kritzik characterized her as a prostitute was inadmissable 
loss of the affidavit as evidence may make the governments case 
more difficult to prove because it is believed to be the only 
statement from kritzik implicating the twins in the sexformoney 
arrangement 
ms harris a former actress and model faces two counts of tax 
evasion and two counts of failure to file income tax returns the 
charges carry a maximum penalty of 12 years in prison and 625000 
in fines 
in opening statements us attorney mel johnson said government 
documents and witnesses would show that the payments were 
taxable she knew it and willfully evaded it 
coffey told the jury the evidence would prove that many of the 
governments witnesses are serving their own interests by 
testifying 
the identical blonde twins who appeared nude together in two 
movies and in a 1981 edition of playboy allegedly spent alternate 
nights with kritzik for more than five years until june 1987 
irs agent james ansier who interviewed kritzik in december 1987 
at his palm springs calif home testified monday that kritzik 
told him the checks he wrote to ms harris were payments for 
services 
he said it was not a gift ansier said he was clear and 
convincing in everything he said 
in throwing out the affidavit curran said he believed an 
unexpected visit by an irs agent strikes fear in the heart of any 
reasonable person 
curran said it was safe to assume kritzik thought the irs was 
investigating his own financial affairs and had sufficient 
motivation to claim these payments were for services 
rendered 
the court is of the position that mr kritzik found himself 
between the proverbial rock and a hard place the judge said 
curran also said he suspected kritzik answered the questions 
without realizing he might place ms harris in a difficult 
position

the bush administration will consider 
returning iraq to its list of countries that sponsor international 
terrorism secretary of state james a baker iii told congress 
today 
baker said iraqs efforts to develop a nuclear program was 
particularly disturbing iraq was removed from the list in 1984 
i think we have to take a look at this issue and we will be 
taking a look at this issue baker told a senate appropriations 
subcommittee a day after the state departments annual report to 
congress on terrorism 
that report cited six nations for sponsoring international 
terrorism including syria and iran which won praise from 
president bush on monday for their help in the release of american 
hostage frank h reed in lebanon 
countries on the list are denied advanced american technology 
and us support for various international bank loans in addition 
to syria and iran the list includes libya cuba north korea and 
south yeman 
sen robert kasten rwis told baker that whatever the 
administrations decision he would promote legislation in congress 
to put iraq on the terrorism list 
baker said the administration was considering several sanctions 
against the iraqi government including a denial of credits for 
agricultural purchases but he cautioned we ought to be at least 
conscious if we take that action our allies will be very quick to 
pick up our market there he said 
the state department terrorism report credited syria and libya 
with showing some improvement and it said iran had a slight 
decline from 32 incidents of supporting terrorism in 1988 to 28 
last year 
the report released monday recorded a sharp drop worldwide as 
well as among american victims sixteen us citizens were killed 
and 19 wounded compared with 192 killed and 40 wounded in 1988 
the bombing of pan american flight 103 over lockerbie scotland 
accounted for most of the 1988 deaths 
overall the number of terrorist incidents fell off nearly 38 
percent from 856 in 1988 to 528 last year 
syria and iran remain on the state departments list of 
supporters of terrorism though syrias willingness to help 
liberate western hostages and a pledge by president hafez assad to 
punish perpetrators were noted 
on the other hand syria continued to provide support and safe 
haven for a wide variety of groups engaged in terrorism the report 
said among them is the militant hezbollah group with which 
holders of the six remaining american hostages in lebanon are 
considered linked 
iran meanwhile was accused in the report of continuing to use 
terrorism after the death of the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in 
june in pursuit of its foreign policy goals 
examples cited by the report included a call for the death of 
salman rushdie author of the satanic verses and increased 
attacks against interests of saudi arabia including explosion of 
two bombs during the islamic pilgrimage to mecca 
president hashemi rafsanjani sometimes credited with taking a 
moderate stance was criticized for exhorting palestinians to kill 
americans and other westerners in order to avenge palestinians 
killed during the rebellion against israel on the west bank and in 
gaza 
rafsanjani also publicly encouraged the hijacking of airplanes 
and the blowing up of factories the report said 
libya while listed as a sponsor of terrorism was credited in 
the report with continuing to show public signs of moderation 
there were no incidents throughout the year directly attributable 
to the north african country led by col moammar gadhafi the 
report said 
with the level of terrorism in sharp decline worldwide the only 
spectacular operation was the bombing of a french airliner over 
niger last september causing 171 deaths 
also the afghan government curtailed its terrorist campaign in 
neighboring pakistan and operations by groups associated with the 
palestine liberation organization sharply declined after chairman 
yasser arafat publicly renounced terrorism in december 1988 the 
report said 
a change in accounting by the state departments 
counterterrorism office also contributed to the dropoff for the 
first time violence by palestinians against palestinians on the 
west bank and in gaza is not considered an act of international 
terrorism 
the reason the report said in a footnote is that the attacks 
are a form of intraethnic violence meaning within the same 
group this helped bring the overall total down 
the 528 incidents of terrorism recorded by the state department 
resulted in 390 victims killed and 397 wounded fourteen terrorists 
were killed and 23 wounded 
in 1988 by contrast 638 victims were killed and 1125 were 
wounded 
most of the attacks occurred in the middle east followed by 
latin america and western europe

panamanian president guillermo endara went 
today to capitol hill where a bill containing 420 million for his 
country inched its way through a tangle of unrelated amendments in 
the senate 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he hoped 
to complete the supplemental money bill today and send it to a 
conference with the house to work out differences between competing 
versions 
endara who met with president bush on monday conferred with 
house speaker thomas foley dwash and members of the house 
foreign affairs committee he planned later meetings with mitchell 
and senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
at the same time secretary of state james a baker iii 
chastised congress for delaying the aid package i really worry 
that we have succumbed to the temptation to play politics with the 
future of freedom and democracy in central america he told a 
senate appropriations subcommittee 
prospects for the bill brightened late monday when the senate 
accepted by voice vote two provisions that had been road blocks 
dealing with abortions and the death penalty in the district of 
columbia 
senators agreed to allow use of dc funds to pay for abortions 
for poor women and permit the death penalty for drugrelated 
murders in the district with the understanding that final wording 
would be worked out in negotiations with the house 
they also agreed to limit additional amendments to a list 
including lithuania cuba and aid to south american countries 
trying to halt drug production 
but if the abortion payment provision remains in the bill bush 
has vowed to veto it which would lead to further delay 
ive asked and asked again that our aid package to the newly 
liberated people of panama be passed and passed swiftly and still 
it waits and with it the future of the fledgling democracy bush 
said endara at his side after the two leaders met for 2 hours on 
monday 
endara was installed as president last dec 20 after us 
invasion forces toppled the government of gen manuel antonio 
noriega bush is seeking a quick infusion of us aid to help 
restart the countrys economy stalled by us economic sanctions 
and damage from the invasion 
the aid measure also includes 300 million that bush requested 
for the new democratic government of nicaragua along with hundreds 
of millions in spending added by congress for domestic programs 
ranging from food stamps to veterans benefits and pet local 
projects 
during endaras white house visit bush announced plans to 
nominate the first panamanian to manage the panama canal gilberto 
guardia fabrega 60 president of a panama city architectural and 
engineering company the 1978 panama canal treaties call for a 
panamanian to be put n charge ths year subject to senate

a former argentine general accused of 
ordering mass murders has been ordered to pay damages totaling 89 
million in three lawsuits but its possible none of the money will 
ever be collected 
lawyers for plaintiffs who blame carlos suarez mason for 
atrocities in argentine military prisons believe he possesses 
hidden wealth but they have been unable to find it 
in a ruling made public monday us district judge lowell 
jensen ordered suarez mason who was extradited to his homeland to 
pay 8 million to two former argentines whose relatives were 
tortured and killed in the 1970s 
the plaintiffs now residents of alexandria va sought a total 
of 40 million in damages 
two earlier damage awards included 21 million to a lawyer who 
was tortured repeatedly during four years imprisonment and 60 
million to the relatives of three men who were killed 
suarez mason commanded the first army corps in buenos aires 
under the military government from 1976 to 1979 
he was arrested in a san francisco suburb in january 1987 and 
extradited to argentina in may 1988 to face 39 murder charges all 
involving the killing of prisoners by soldiers under his command 
he remains jailed in buenos aires awaiting trial 
as suarez mason awaited extradition several former argentines 
living in the united states sued him for damages those complaints 
were filed under laws allowing suits for international human rights 
violations committed by a foreigner who has come under the 
jurisdiction of a us court 
suarez mason did not file answers to the suits and was held in 
default 
jensen said one of the plaintiffs in his ruling debora 
benchoam was held without charges from july 1977 to november 1981 
he said she was tortured and sexually abused several times and 
robbed of her jewelry by forces under suarez masons control 
she also was forced to watch as the soldiers twice shot her 
brother reuben who was later beaten and murdered according to the 
judge 
jensen awarded her 3 million for pain and suffering and 3 
million in punitive damages 
the second plaintiff alfredo forti and his mother and four 
brothers were abducted by suarez masons soldiers held for a week 
without charges and robbed of most of their belongings jensen 
said he said forti was separated from his mother who was never 
seen or heard from again 
in an earlier ruling in the case jensen ruled that causing the 
disappearance of fortis mother was a violation of 
international law subject to a damage suit in this country fortis 
lawyer said it was the first such ruling by a us court 
jensen awarded forti 1 million for emotional distress and 1 
million in punitive damages

defense secretary dick cheney extended the 
pentagons freeze on military construction projects today and 
ordered that 207 projects including four controversial navy ports 
in texas alabama mississippi and new york be reviewed for 
possible cancellation 
cheneys action will cause consternation on capitol hill which 
has been locked with cheney in a tense debate over slashing the 
defense budget and some lawmakers attempts to protect local jobs 
cheney in a statement issued at the pentagon said the order 
affects more than 7 billion in new construction contracts in 
the united states western europe and the pacific 
the 207 construction projects to be reviewed are valued at 12 
billion and include four of the sites identified by the navy as 
strategic home ports in ingleside texas mobile ala pascagoula 
miss and staten island ny the statement said 
the secretary said he was forced to continue the freeze 
instituted in january through june 15th because of possible 
budget cutbacks ordered by capitol hill and the sweeping changes in 
international events 
in light of the enormous uncertainty over the level of funding 
that congress will approve for future defense budgets including 
the budget for fiscal 1991 i have no choice but to extend the 
construction freeze cheney said 
citing changes in the world situation and increasing budget 
limitations cheney said signifcant opportunities exist to 
reduce the cost and size of the future infrastructure for the 
department of defense 
some of these actions may not be popular with members of 
congress who want to cut the defense budget even as they plead to 
save the projects in their own states and districts he said 
but when tight budgets force dedicated soldiers to turn in their 
uniforms and leave the service i cannot put construction projects 
ahead of people 
the house was scheduled to vote today on a house budget 
committee proposal that would significantly reduce defense spending 
from president bushs proposed 3033 billion for fiscal 1991 
the secretarys order directs that no new construction contracts 
be awarded for projects financed under the military construction 
budget approved by congress 
the 207 construction projects will be candidates for 
rescission which means cheney may recommend that congress revoke 
the funding approve for earlier projects 
the statement said deputy defense secretary donald atwood will 
review the departments construction plans for possible 
cancellation and submit a proposed list of rescissions to cheney by 
june 1 
the statement said that besides the four ports the review will 
also include the items 
110 million for the large rocket test facility at arnold tenn 
60 millin in improvements at fort hood and red river army 
depot in texas 
37 millino for the consolidated maintenance facility at

the government will restart the first of three 
tritium production reactors at its south carolina atomic weapons 
plant in december and resume producing plutonium triggers by next 
july at a colorado plant energy secretary james d watkins said 
today 
watkins told a senate armed services subcommittee that four 
plants including three reactors at its savannah river complex in 
south carolina will resume producing nuclear weapons components by 
the end of 1991 
the three reactors have been shut down since mid1988 over 
environmental and safetyrelated concerns us nuclear weapons 
production has ground to a halt in the past several months because 
of that and suspension of operations at the rocky flats plant in 
colorado last november over similar concerns 
watkins said the k reactor at savannah river is tentatively 
scheduled to reopen with lowpower testing on dec 10 followed by 
fullpower production in late december or early january 
the p reactor at savannah river is to be restarted next march 
with production of weapons components scheduled to resume in april 
he said 
the l reactor at savannah river will be restarted in september 
1991 watkins said 
in addition he said two facilities at the rocky flats plant for 
producing the plutonium triggers in atomic warheads will resume 
operations in june and july 
at this time there does not seem to be any alternative for 
the nation other than keeping rocky flats on line to deal with 
warhead management watkings told the strategic forces and 
nuclear deterrence subcommittee 
environmental and antinuclear groups and organizations of local 
residents living near the plants asked watkins at a meeting monday 
to request a moratorium on weapons production 
but members of the senate panel said the country cannot afford 
to go without weapons production indefinitely 
i wish i could say we dont need any production of weapons 
material said subcommittee chairman j james exon dneb that 
is not the case the soviet union is going to be relying on its 
nucelar deterrent as a strategy than ever before 
watkins repeated his monday assertion to the coalition of 
environmental and antinuclear groups that the president congress 
and the secretary of defense determine the need for weapons 
production 
its my job to deliver the goods he told the coalition 
called the military production network 
lisa crawford of the fernald residents for environmental safety 
and health which recently won a 78 million court settlement 
against the energy departments former contractor at the fernald 
uranium processing plant in ohio said the government must be more 
open about operations at nuclear weapons factories 
the folks who live around these facilities are really 
disillusioned she told watkins she said she and others who 
lived near the fernald plant learned in 1985 they had been drinking 
from a uraniumcontaminated well since 1981 and that the 
government had known but did not tell them 
the department has agreed to a wide study of the environmental 
impact of weapons plant modernization but has not said this would 
affect its schedule for getting the main production plants back on 
line after lengthy shutdowns 
at a news conference before meeting watkins coalition leaders 
criticized him for failing to change the departments acknowledged 
record of improving weapons production at the expense of 
environmental protection and public health 
on watkins list of priorities like those of his predecessors 
production of new nuclear weapons comes first comes second and 
comes third environmental protection comes after that said 
elizabeth paul director of the snake river alliance an 
idahobased citizens group that opposes further arms production

the african national congress and 
the white minority government on tuesday cautioned against high 
expectations for their historic talks this week on removing 
obstacles to constitutional negotiations 
the public should not be misled the ancs press liaison 
officer patrick lekota said at a news briefing on the eve of the 
scheduled threeday discussions what is taking place tomorrow is 
talks about talks 
gerrit viljoen minister of constitutional development said the 
government realized the urgency of the talks because of widespread 
violence in south africa 
but we also believe it will take time to build trust and 
understanding as a foundation for finding mutually satisfactory 
solutions and for them to have a good chance of working he said 
both sides have predicted negotiations will be long and tedious 
with many major fundamental differences to be resolved 
the anc is demanding the government end a state of emergency and 
release all political prisoners as preconditions for full talks 
the government is demanding the anc renounce its armed struggle 
and help end political violence that has claimed hundreds of lives 
in recent weeks 
the talks scheduled to begin wednesday at the governments 
luxurious groote schuur estate will involve a cabinet team led by 
president fw de klerk and a delegation of exiled and internal anc 
leaders headed by deputy anc president nelson mandela 
the anc has been seeking talks with the government since it was 
formed in 1918 de klerk legalized the anc communist party and 
other opposition groups in february when he also freed mandela 
at the time he urged black leaders to negotiate the end of 
apartheid and help develop a new constitution that would give an 
equal voice in government to the voteless black majority while 
preserving the political economic and cultural rights of whites 
and other minority groups 
both sides have taken pains to emphasize that this weeks 
meetings are not negotiations but only talks aimed at removing 
obstacles and creating a proper climate for eventual discussions on 
a new constitution 
the government has promised its white constituency that it will 
negotiate only with groups that renounce violence de klerk has 
said the anc leaders continued calls for armed struggle hinder the 
chances for negotiations 
the government and the anc may not resolve all of their 
differences this week and further exploratory talks may be 
necessary according to government officials no date has been set 
for fullscale negotiations 
lekota said members of the anc delegation protected at an 
exclusive hotel by security police and anc marshals were busy 
tuesday refining their approach to the talks 
he read a statement in which the anc delegation said its morale 
was high 
the delegation is very enthusiastic and it is confident that 
it will match the governments side lekota said 
about 2000 people marched in mixedrace townships outside cape 
town tuesday in the first legal may day march at which the 
communist party flag was carried 
late last year the government declared may day a workers 
holiday in response to years of protests and illegal strikes by 
black trade unions 
police reported tuesday that six people had died seven were 
wounded and many houses and vehicles were damaged in unrest on 
sunday and monday 
police said four women including an 80yearold were burned to 
death near port shepstone on the southern natal coast where black 
factions have been engaged in a power struggle for the past two 
weeks 
six people were injured when police fired at violent groups or 
defended themselves against mob attacks police said

gov mike sullivan who came into office 
four years ago on a campaign to spur wyomings economy reiterated 
that pledge today in announcing his bid for a second term 
sullivan 50 a democrat who left his casper law practice in 
1986 to make his first bid for public office said he had succeeded 
if for no other reason than that the economy hasnt been the 
economic wasteland some predicted 
there is no question that weve made sacrifices that its 
been a lot of hard work and its been difficult times in 
wyoming sullivan told a crowd of supporters who gathered at his 
office to hear his announcement 
but some of the dire predictions the doom and gloom that was 
predicted four years ago has been averted 
the governor said he expects his likely opponent republican 
mary mead to challenge his claim that the economy has improved 
she is a jackson rancher the daughter of former gov cliff hansen 
sullivan is expected to face only token opposition in the aug 
21 democratic primary 
when sullivan ran for his first term wyoming was in the depths 
of a recession induced by the slump in its oil industry 
oil prices are a bit more stable now but remain low enough to 
discourage major exploration and production in wyomings oil fields 
without that production the sullivan administration has worked 
on increasing international trade and tourism 
among other things the governor has thrown his support behind a 
250 million lowinterest loan for use in enticing companies to 
build a natural gas pipeline from wyoming to california that will 
carry wyoming gas

congressional leaders today gave president 
bush strong support for his refusal to bargain for the release of 
american hostages in lebanon and expressed hope were seeing the 
beginning of the end of their captivity 
bush met at the white house with democratic and republican 
leaders one day after educator frank reed was released following 43 
months in captivity he was the second american freed in eight 
days following the april 22 release of robert polhill who was 
held for 39 months 
i think the president has strong support in his view that we 
cant bargain hostagebyhostage house speaker tom foley 
dwash said afterward 
the basic position that we dont bargain for the release of 
hostages is one widely shared by the congress as well as the 
executive branch he said 
expressing hopes for freedom of the six americans still in 
captivity foley said were seeing the beginning of the end of 
the hostagetaking and the hostageholding 
the speaker steered clear of discussing congress attitude 
toward the 400 shiite prisoners held by israel saying these are 
delicate matters foley said i think we want to do whatever is 
useful in encouraging the release of people who have been held 
without cause or without reason 
on monday bush gently nudged israel to release a shiite cleric 
sheik abdulkarim obeid and others as demanded by a tehran 
newspaper as a next step in the process 
bush said he had certainly no objection to such an action 
adding and that is a matter for others to determine in the 
past israel has freed hundreds of arab prisoners to attain the 
release of a handful of israeli captives 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater pressed to 
elaborate on bushs comment said israel is a sovereign nation and 
the united states will not tell it what to do however he said 
our policy is that all hostages should be released 
he refused to say whether the united states considers the 
shiites as hostages or prisoners of war 
meanwhile fitzwater said state department legal adviser abraham 
sofaer was in the netherlands at the hague for a regularly 
scheduled meeting of the iranus claims tribunal which is 
arbitrating legal and financial disputes between the two countries 
fitzwater said the meeting was not connected with the hostages 
release 
as he met with congressional leaders today bush said it is 
joyous news that reed was released he also noted that polhill 
had given him a secret message monday from his captors but refused 
to comment further on the hostages 
bush publicly praised syria and iran for exerting pressure on 
the kidnappers 
yet bush also prodded syria and iran to work for the release of 
more hostages emphasizing they should not expect normal relations 
or vast improvement until all americans are freed 
when a step is taken that goes toward that day when all 
hostages are released i should say thank you bush said but 
beyond that i cant say that i can be happy 
ive tried to put myself in the place of the other families 
and say hey what about my loved one so this is a tough 
business the president said 
appearing before a senate appropriations subcommittee secretary 
of state james a baker iii was asked what the united states might 
be asked to due in return for assistance by iran and syria in 
gaining release of polhill and reed 
i will not comment on what we are being asked to do directly 
or indirectly replied baker 
he went on to say that our policy is that we should not engage 
in dealmaking over hostages 
ignoring the advice of some advisers bush took no steps to 
postpone the release of a state department report on terrorism that 
criticized both syria and iran 
the report marring the two nations efforts to improve their 
reputations said iran still uses terrorism in pursuit of foreign 
policy goals and syria continues to support a variety of terrorist 
groups 
as reed was relishing his first hours of freedom in damascus 
syria bush met at the white house with polhill who has been 
undergoing treatment at walter reed army medical center here 
polhill suffering from a growth on his vocal cords spoke in a 
raspy whisper he said he could not offer much information about 
the other hostages 
during an hourlong meeting with bush polhill delivered a 
message from his kidnappers white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said the contents would not be revealed publicly because polhill 
had guaranteed his captors that it would be private and personal 
to president bush only 
the presidents words of praise for iran in reeds release were 
in sharp contrast to his reluctance to give tehran much credit when 
polhill was freed 
iranian officials were said to have been furious over what was 
perceived as a slight in the latest instance bush singled out 
iran for using its influence to help bring about this 
humanitarian step 
us officials said privately the words were intended as a 
reward for iran which after years of isolation from the west was 
seeking recognition for positive deeds 
iran meanwhile said no more americans would be released unless 
the united states reciprocated with a gesture of bushs oftstated 
promise that goodwill begets goodwill 
now the ball is in the court of the us and the western 
countries said the englishlanguage tehran times considered 
close to president hashemi rafsanjani 
asked if he was ready to make a goodwill gesture in return for 
the hostages release bush said all must be freed 
were not in a piecemeal basis bidding for one human life 
holding out hopes only to have them dashed for one american family 
or another he said

a state district judge today gave state lawmakers 
an additional month to reform school finance but said he also was 
appointing a special master to draw up an alternate plan in case 
legislators again fail 
earlier today judge scott mccown ruled that nearly 500 million 
in state education aid cant be paid to local school districts as 
scheduled on may 25 
in a second hearing mccown gave the state an extension until 
june 1 to develop a new school finance plan 
but mccown said the court will work concurrently with the 
executive and legislative branches by appointing a special master 
to draw an equitable school finance plan 
the courts plan will go into effect on sept 1 if the 
legislature doesnt have its own finance plan ready by then mccown 
said 
the present scheme of public school finance is a great 
wrong he said the poor have waited for too long 
state officials had asked for a 50day delay to give lawmakers 
and gov bill clements more time to work out a school finance 
reform plan 
with the state legislatures 30day session at an end house 
speaker gib lewis said clements would call lawmakers into another 
special session the third on education at 2 pm wednesday 
the states highest court last year called the 135 billion 
school system unfair to propertypoor school districts and ordered 
a reform plan by today but lawmakers and the governor are locked 
in a battle over increasing taxes to pay for reform 
mccowns ruling doesnt apply to nonstate sources of school 
funds including local and federal aid state officials have said 
they believe schools can remain open at least until may 25 when 
the 500 million monthly aid payment was due to go out 
the judge also said the state can pay the 27 million payroll 
for texas education agency employees that had been held up pending 
his ruling state comptroller bob bullock had said earlier that he 
intended to freeze education payments including payroll checks 
the legislature proposed a 555 million reform plan and a 
halfcent sales tax increase to fund it and pump more money to 
poorer school districts the proposal would boost the sales tax 
from 6 cents to 6 cents on the dollar but clements said he would 
veto the bill saying money is available elsewhere for a less 
expensive reform plan 
clements veto vow prompted about 300 teachers to picket the 
governors mansion monday he was out of town 
we want to send a message to the people of the state of texas 
as well as the governor that this is a serious issue that has 
reached a critical stage said shelley potter president of the 
san antonio federation of teachers 
texas is one of a dozen states where courts have overturned 
school finance systems deemed unfair to poor districts the others 
are kentucky new jersey kansas wisconsin california 
connecticut washington west virginia wyoming arkansas and 
montana 
texas has 1100 school districts more than 400 million in 
april state aid payments went to schools last wednesday bullock 
said the money he would withhold unless the judge intercedes 
included nearly 27 million in payroll checks due today for more 
than 1000 employees of the texas education agency 
but clements said monday the matter likely would have no 
immediate impact 
we dont really have a problem he said we have ample 
funds and the funds are in hand to pay the teachers until i 
believe its the last two days of the school year 
some school districts would not be able to meet financial 
obligations if state funding stops ms potter said 
thats a very serious situation it hurts the employees it 
hurts the kids she said theyve been playing around with the 
issue and using the kids as political pawns and were tired of 
it 
the predominantly democratic legislature and republican governor 
have had seven months to deal with the courtordered reform the 
supreme court on oct 2 1989 ruled the school finance system 
unconstitutional but clements didnt call the legislature into 
session to consider the matter until feb 27

a mathematician who filed a lawsuit so he can 
freeze his own head before he dies from a brain tumor said tuesday 
the odds of achieving immortality arent as bad as one might think 
we think that everyone should be immortal the purpose of 
medicine should be to bring about that immortality thomas 
donaldson said in a telephone interview from his home in sunnyvale 
a silicon valley town south of san francisco 
donaldson 46 said he wants his head quickfrozen while he is 
still alive using a process known as cryonic suspension hes 
betting that future scientists will discover a way to cure the 
tumor and attach his head to a healthy body 
in a lawsuit filed monday in santa barbara county superior 
court donaldson seeks to bar state and local officials from 
preventing his cryonic suspension before he is declared legally 
dead 
donaldson said the choice to file the suit in santa barbara 
about 250 miles south of his home was arbitrary 
its a nice area he said its really a case against 
the state of california 
cryonic suspension is a procedure in which all or part of the 
body is supposedly preserved in a deep freeze advocates of 
cryonics say waiting for legal brain death hurts patients chances 
of successful reawakening 
to date the procedure only has been performed after a patient 
has died of natural causes donaldson said he wants to secure the 
right to have the procedure before the tumor significantly damages 
his brain 
i am dying and want to be cryonically suspended so that i 
might later be revived and continue to live said donaldson a 
member of the alcor life extension foundation based in riverside 
in california legal death is defined as when a person would not 
show signs of brain activity as recorded by an 
electroencephalograph 
alcor gained national attention in 1987 when the head of an 
elderly woman was frozen after she died at the lab authorities 
questioned whether her head was removed before she died 
donaldson says radiation treatment has not affected his tumor 
which was discovered in 1988 court papers say that although the 
tumor is stable he has only a 40 percent chance of living to 
august 1993 
so hes filing suit now 
the court system cannot be depended upon to decide these 
things very fast he said 
donaldson a senior mathematician at mimd systems in belmont 
hasnt decided where if he succeeds to have his cryonic 
suspension done but he says the alcor lab in riverside about 55 
miles east of los angeles would be a logical place for suspension 
and storage 
in the procedure he would be anesthetized while his body 
temperature is reduced alcor surgeons then would replace his blood 
with glycol and other chemicals to minimize tissue damage caused by 
freezing 
donaldsons head would be surgically removed at the end of the 
operation then sealed in a vacuum container and maintained at 
minus 320 degrees fahrenheit the operation would cost him 35000 
a fullbody suspension costs about 100000 
donaldson said hes been planning on cryonic suspension since 
before he joined alcor in 1975 his wife kathryn woof is all for 
it shes a cryonicist too he said 
this is not a ritual were trying to improve the chances of 
revival of the person were suspending he said

borough president ruth messinger asked mayor david dinkins on 
monday to cancel city funds for the monument at the northeast 
corner of central park 
we think we can find a better use for the 450000 said 
messingers spokesman andrew breslau who also called the statue 
aesthetically suspect dinkins said tuesday the city actually 
planned to spend only 100000 for installation the rest is for 
improvements to a traffic island where the statue would be 
displayed 
the current sculpture is the third version by robert graham i 
dont know if this is the final one he said 
statue supporters sniffed at their opponents saying these are 
sophisticated ladies not tramps 
we chose the artist and we are very pleased with the statue 
pianist bobby short said i believe in it 
short helped to raise nearly 1 million in private funds for the 
monument 
grahams proposal is for a bronze staue nearly three stories 
high 
graham whose works are at such places as the museum of modern 
art and the whitney museum attracted some controversy at the 
olympic games in los angeles in 1984 with his two massive headless 
male and female nude figures 
the duke ellington society issued a statement beautiful women 
were always an important component in the life and work of duke 
ellington so naturally the sculptor made them an integral 
component of his work

vice president dan quayle called tuesday 
for savings from reduced defense spending to be channeled into 
spacerelated research 
investing in space is especially important in light of the 
decline in our military spending he told the american institute 
of aeronautics and astronautics in a luncheon speech 
the vice president recalled that much past investment in 
military research and development has had civilian benefits 
thanks to the promising trend toward a more peaceful and less 
threatening world it does appear our defense spending will 
decline said quayle who is the head of the national space 
council 
to ensure that we continue to benefit from research and 
development in advanced technologies we therefore need to continue 
and expand our investment in spacerelated research he said 
quayle praised the governmentprivate industry partnership that 
made possible the recent successful launch of the pegasus the 
pegasus is a payloadcarrying rocket launched from under the wing 
of an airplane 
soon small commercial satellites will open a trillion dollar 
industry supplying additional new informatin services from space 
services such as cellular telephones worldwide tv and computer 
services and much more he said 
think what this could mean to a developing nation it could 
skip the entire cost of stringing wires and other infrastructure 
expenses and still develop state of the art communications 
services 
the next century said quayle will provide new medicines and 
medical understandings from research and manufacturing in space 
material from the moon could enable us to supply many of the 
earths energy needs safely and cleanly from space he said the 
reference apparently was to helium3 in abundant supply on the 
moon which in gaseous form could be used to power fusion reactors 
on earth

the federal aviation administration and 
airline industry joined forces tuesday to oppose legislation that 
would increase the federal role in inspecting aging airliners 
anthony broderick faa associate administrator told a house 
hearing that the bill would increase government liability and could 
cost between 1 million and 2 million per aircraft 
it would take five years to hire and train the needed 
inspectors he said 
faa inspectors oversee regular checks and maintenance conducted 
by the airlines but dont routinely dismantle and inspect airliners 
themselves 
the hearing of the house public works aviation subcommittee came 
two years and two days after an 18foot section of the roof ripped 
off an aging aloha airlines boeing 737 in flight over hawaii 
sweeping a flight attendant to her death that incident prompted 
new concern about aging airliners and led to a governmentindustry 
task force that planned faa response to the problem 
the average us airliner is nearly 13 years old and more than 
onefourth of the planes are more than 20 years old thats 
expected to increase as growing demand keeps aircraft from being 
retired 
the bill proposed by democratic and republican leaders of the 
aviation subcommittee would require the faa to thoroughly inspect 
each airliner during the last year of its economic design life 
which could vary with each aircraft according to how it is used 
unless approved in an faa inspection planes would be grounded 
after they reach the predetermined design life 
the bill would fundamentally change the way faa works to ensure 
aviation safety replacing airline inspections with faa 
inspections broderick told the panel 
this proposed departure from traditional practices troubles us 
quite a bit he said 
he said the faa workload in the first year would be something 
almost impossible to contemplate conducting as we would be 
required to inspect over 1000 aircraft a task that is simply 
unrealistic 
broderick said the faa is already having a difficult time coping 
with its inspection duties because of rapid growth of the industry 
since the aloha accident the faa has changed its approach to 
airline aging from one of requiring frequent inspections to 
mandating changes of critical parts of aircraft when they reach a 
set number of cycles or takeoffs and landings 
i feel strongly that the agencys aging aircraft program 
represents the best thinking and cooperative efforts of government 
and industry broderick said 
robert e doll united airlines vice president who heads the 
governmentindustry task force said adding inspection duties for 
the faa could impinge other safety efforts of both the airlines and 
the government 
he said the possibility of increased liability for the 
government could bring extensive disassembly and exhaustive 
inspections of planes that would lead to repair costs so great as 
to provoke the premature retirement of airworthy airplanes 
that doll said could lead to a shortage of aircraft as the 
demand for air travel grows 
he said it would also be very difficult to determine the design 
life of each aircraft because some parts are sensitive to flight 
hours others to flight cycles and still others to calendar age 
doll proposed however that the faa increase its attention to 
new air carriers to ensure that they have adequate inspection and 
maintenance programs

tens of thousands of protesters in red square 
unleashed their fury at mikhail s gorbachev tuesday turning the 
traditional may day parade into an outpouring of complaints about 
the economy and the blockade of lithuania 
the soviet president has allowed free debate in the press and 
politics and endured public criticism but never before has he had 
to personally face such an outburst of discontent over his 
policies from both right and left 
the criticism included jeers to the faces of soviet leaders 
gorbachev 59 tapped his fingers on the parapet of the red 
granite reviewing stand during the protest showing his impatience 
but otherwise was impassive he and the other officials left after 
enduring the unofficial demonstrators for about 20 minutes but it 
was unclear if they were leaving in response to the protests 
neither gorbachev nor any of the other communist or government 
leaders on the reviewing stand spoke to the crowd 
dozens of the demonstrators carried the yellow red and green 
national flags of the breakaway lithuanian republic and shouted 
shame and freedom for lithuania 
some waved their fists at the leaders numbering about two 
dozen and shouted resign over the holiday music blaring from 
loudspeakers 
one caustic sign likened the soviet leadership to nicolae 
ceausescu the romanian dictator executed in december after a 
popular uprising kremlin ceausescus from armchairs to prison 
beds it read 
the leaders clearly expected some criticism they authorized the 
unofficial demonstration and took control of the traditional 
parade that preceded it from local communist party and government 
officials 
but they likely did not expect the tone to be quite so angry or 
the scale quite so large 
gorbachevs popularity has waned during his five years in office 
because his reforms have failed to resolve chronic economic 
problems many people believe supplies of food housing and 
consumer goods actually are worse under gorbachev 
he also is under fire for the blockade of oil raw materials and 
other goods he imposed on lithuania to force the baltic republic to 
back off its march 11 declaration of independence 
for decades the red square rally on may day has been an 
orchestrated show of support for official policies entry onto red 
square was rigidly controlled this year there was little of the 
usual polite praise just about anyone could join the march on the 
gray cobblestone stretching from the historical museum to the 
multicolored st basils cathedral 
we are all so very tired of these formal galas when long 
before the holiday the lists of demonstration participants were put 
out said the official news agency tass 
soviet leaders went on record this year as preferring a parade 
like those before the 1917 revolution when may day was marked with 
smaller spontaneous affairs aimed at voicing workers grievances 
about the czarist regime 
what they got instead were posters that declared down with 
the empire of red fascism and today a blockade of lithuania 
tomorrow a blockade of moscow the black flags of an anarchist 
group stood out in the sea of colors 
the wave of protesters continued to file through red square 
which holds about 50000 marchers for more than an hour after the 
leaders left police gradually and apparently gently moved them 
along a few thousand trekked almost a mile to a square across from 
gorky park to renew their demonstration 
the nightly newscast vremya noted briefly the raucous nature 
of the unofficial protest and showed some of the marchers 
including a woman who appeared to be shaking her fist at the soviet 
leaders 
the last minutes of the celebration were somewhat marred by 
the actions of certain people actions which were dissonant with 
the general mood the newscast said 
there were also protests in leningrad the soviet unions 
secondlargest city and birthplace of the revolution marchers on 
palace square waved banners that read communism is a universal 
shame and freedom for lithuania according to leningrad 
journalist maxim korzhov they also demanded gorbachevs 
resignation 
tass said marchers in the ukrainian capital of kiev expressed 
concern about the treatment of victims of the 1986 chernobyl 
nuclear power plant accident it said demonstrators in alma ata 
the capital of kazakhstan urged officials to close the 
semipalatinsk nuclear test site 
a subway worker attending the red square parade as an official 
guest said he was stunned 
a revolution is a revolution what else can i say said the 
worker who identified himself only as yuri 
even the official segment of the parade which lasted 75 
minutes featured banners and speeches critical of the leaderships 
policy especially its plans to introduce a market economy 
enough experiments lets work and democracy is not 
demagoguery two banners read 
the conservative tone of some of the banners and speeches in the 
official segment indicated that gorbachev faces criticism not only 
from reformers but from workers who fear the transition to a 
market economy will worsen their lives 
labor leaders demanded attention to their worries that economic 
reforms will lead to price increases and unemployment 
the basic reason for the crisis situation is that the 
leadership of the party and the government have been chronically 
late in putting into effect cardinal political and economic 
measures said yevgeny kablov a doctor of technology 
he appealed for strengthening staterun businesses facing 
competition from cooperatives the privately owned businesses that 
some accuse of blackmarketeering and pricegouging 
among those on the reviewing stand was newly elected moscow 
mayor gavriil popov a reformminded economist who is critical of 
gorbachev popovs supporters in the moscow city council are 
pushing to turn much of the capitals retail trade into private 
hands

the haze cleared from irelands buses and 
movie theaters tuesday as the government cracked down on smoking 
authorities outlawed smoking in cinemas and buses and ordered 
segregated smoking areas to be set up in government buildings 
trains schools libraries hospitals airports supermarkets 
restaurants and art galleries 
health inspectors will make spot checks throughout the country 
with the power to fine offenders up to 160 owners or managers 
failing to enforce the ban can be fined up to 800 
restaurateurs were angered that the ban does not apply to pubs 
or bars 
there seem to be two laws said henry oneill head of the 
restaurant owners association publicans pubkeepers have gone 
into food in a major way yet they are not restricted it is 
unfair 
ireland already bars tobacco advertising on radio and tv and 
the health department said it hopes the new laws will be the 
final pieces in the jigsaw of the governments antismoking 
policy 
patrick macnutt a galway university economics lecturer said he 
does not smoke but sees the ban as government interference 
an individual right has been relegated to an imposed rule 
macnutt said 
richard miller director of the dublinbased edmund burke 
institute which campaigns for individual rights doubted the ban 
would be enforced 
he said it was introduced to satisfy the demand for 
regulations and to enable ireland to look modern progressive and 
trendy 
irish smokers have declined to 27 percent of the population from 
45 percent in 1975 a pack of 20 cigarettes costs 320 of which 
the government takes 67 percent in taxes

up to 700 vietnamese children and young people 
living in southeast asian refugee camps will be granted political 
asylum in this country immigration and naturalization service 
commissioner gene mcnary announced tuesday 
the young people described by immigration authorities as 
unaccompanied by parents or adult relatives were all under age 18 
when they arrived at refugee camps some are now in their early 20s 
the ins will begin interviewing the applicants this month to 
screen them for political asylum mcnary said the first refugees 
from the group are expected to arrive in the united states in july 
and the rest by years end mcnary said in a statement 
immigration authorities said the young people were unable to 
qualify as political refugees when previously interviewed because 
they were too young or inarticulate at the time to provide evidence 
of political persecution 
many of these young people and children have families still 
living in vietnam including fathers who fought in the south 
vietnamese army during the vietnam war which ended 15 years ago 
their lives are in suspension and it seemed like an 
appropriate time to go back and reinterview those people in the 
most generous manner said ralph thomas deputy assistant ins 
commissioner for refugee asylum and parole 
we anticipate that the large bulk of them will be admitted as 
refugees thomas said 
most of the children and young people are living in refugee 
camps in thailand others are in the philippines indonesia and 
hong kong 
since the war ended more than 1 million vietnamese refugees 
have been admitted to the united states 
some of the 700 young people have relatives living in this 
country authorities said 
mcnary said he hopes the initiative will set an example for 
other nations to implement the comprehensive plan of action an 
international agreement for resettling indochinese refugees

a man who stole 2 million in federal 
housing funds and used the money to buy sports cars furs and 
jewelry was sentenced tuesday to six years in prison and ordered 
to pay 4 million in fines and restitution 
cy walker a 50yearold former montgomery real estate broker 
was ordered to report to prison june 1 for embezzling 2 million 
from an unwitting us department of housing and urban development 
during a 21month period in 198687 
us attorney jim wilson said walker was not connected to 
highlevel hud officials in any kind of conspiracy but he said 
the fact that walker could have pulled this off is indicative of 
the weaknesses of the hud program during the reagan 
administration 
it was a part of the hud scandal but it was done by an 
isolated operator said wilson 
us district judge joel dubina sentenced walker to five years 
in prison for one count of embezzlement of hud funds the judge 
sentenced walker to an additional year to run consecutively on a 
count of failing to pay income tax on the stolen hud money 
walker was fined 2 million on the first count and 25000 on 
the second the judge also ordered restitution to the government of 
2073499 in hud money which walker admitted using to bankroll 
lavish purchases such as 180000 worth of cars including a 
50000 mercedesbenz and an 18000 stingray speedboat 
his attorney david byrne said walker isnt able to pay the 4 
million he doesnt have any present resources to make 
restitution 
he said walker had no comment about the sixyear sentence at an 
as yet undesignated prison but he said walker expressed his 
sorrow for what he had done and most of all for the disappointment 
he caused his parents and loved ones 
walker a real estate broker who had a hud contract to handle 
closings of agency property in the montgomery region admitted 
embezzling the money between february 1986 and october 1987 
according to a hud audit he put agency property closing money in a 
personal bank account then falsified a banks wire transfer forms 
to make regional hud officials think it had been sent for proper 
deposit in a hud account 
when hud inspectors discovered the scheme walker depleted the 
account and closed down his office later as investigators pursued 
him he worked out a deal with prosecutors agreeing to serve as an 
informant in a drug sting operation his testimony led to the 
conviction of east alabama racehorse trainer freddie hyatt before 
the hyatt trial prosecutors agreed to let walker plead guilty to 
two counts in the hud embezzlement case 
the prosecutor said he felt the judge imposed a very fair and 
good sentence on walker particularly in requiring full 
restitution of the embezzled money and more than 2 million in 
fines 
were going to pursue these amounts said wilson whatever 
we can find and legally recover

the house on tuesday approved a bill to raise 
the pay of doctors dentists and nurses who work for the veterans 
affairs department 
the bill approved by voice vote and sent to the senate is in 
response to problems the department has had in recruiting medical 
personnel 
the legislation would increase typical physicians pay from just 
under 100000 to a maximum around 130000 depending on 
experience and specialities 
dentists earning about 65000 would see their pay increase to a 
range of 70000 to 100000 with most toward the lower end 
salaries for health executives could go up by 45000 
the pay structure governing the more than 10000 nurses and 
15000 nursing assistants in the veterans care system also would 
be revamped including a provision allowing local area 
administrators to increase pay to attract adequate staff the 
actual salaries would vary widely depending on experience training 
and region 
the congressional budget office estimates the bill would add 
nearly 60 million in costs to the government in 1991 rising to 
108 million in 1995 
instead of including some method for paying for the increases 
the legislation includes a provision exempting the va health care 
system from the grammrudman deficit reduction law

country music star hank williams jr has 
asked the us supreme court to strike down feelgood 
jurisprudence that gave his halfsister a claim to the estate of 
their famous father 
williams lawyers contended in the filing last month that the 
state supreme court gave a share of the late country music hank 
williams srs estate to his illegitimate daughter jett williams 
even though the estate had been closed since 1975 
williams also asked the court to hear an appeal of a new york 
appeals court that relying on the alabama case gave ms williams 
a share of continuing music royalties stemming from songs written 
by her father 
hank williams sr died five days before his daughter was born in 
1953 to bobbie jett the alabama court noted that her paternity was 
not suggested to her until 1974 when she was a 21yearold 
university of alabama student 
for the next few years her efforts to get documents from the

when rock n roll fans will have a townshend other than his big 
brother pete to admire 
i did my work in the same way that pete did the 29yearold 
guitarist said as he prepared for a club date in nashville 
a lot of people think that was a gift that pete passed onto 
me he said noting it takes more sweat than favors to get a 
musical career off the ground i intend to prove myself however 
long it takes 
his big brother is a tough act to follow pete is a guitarist 
for the who and as composer of such rock classics as tommy 
simons mainstream rock band has an album partly recorded in 
nashville nearing release 
simon was 14 when he began his music career by recording when 
im a man for warner bros in england 
a friend of my dads said why dont we put simon in the

for the first time in years theres more 
than one person running for the lowly office of tree warden but 
its not exactly what youd call a heated contest 
a 66yearold retiree and a 34yearold construction worker say 
they think theyve got the timber for the job but neither seems to 
be overly concerned about winning the may 15 election for the 
700ayear job 
i aint running no campaign at all the other fellow hes not 
campaigning either said edward yagodzinski a retired 
groundskeeper and truck driver 
his opponent brent higgins took an equally dispassionate 
approach a few people said why dont you put your name in for 
it so i said all right 
higgins said he has some experience cutting down trees in his 14 
years as a construction worker but he wasnt willing to say 
whether hed make a better tree warden than yagodzinski 
whoever wins wins he said 
trees are an important part of the rural charm of this town of 
3500 just outside northampton in the western part of the state 
the warden is responsible for maintaining trees along the streets 
and organizing public hearings before any cutting takes place 
like higgins yagodzinski seemed ready to face the prospect of 
defeat 
if i get in all well and good if i dont im not going to 
worry about it ill do more fishing up in vermont he said

didja hear the one about the cop who tried 
a little standup comedy routine before giving a motorist a 
speeding ticket 
a montana teenager wants you to michelle kessinger of columbia 
falls offered a bill in a mock student legislature that would 
require police officers issuing speeding tickets to tell a little 
joke to break the tension 
or else 
the bill mandates law officers start off with a joke to 
lighten the mood when issuing speeding tickets that would 
alleviate tension and reduce the chance that a nervous motorist 
carrying a firearm will do something dangerous she said 
the bill would appropriate 5000 to educate all law officers 
on comical anecdotes and humorous jokes that are in good taste 
nonoffending and somewhat pertinent to the situation 
the humor could be a little forced however officers who fail 
to tell jokes could be fined 10 and up per ticket

the state departments 1 billion program to 
upgrade embassies around the world could run into trouble with 
shrinking budgets and new demands in eastern europe and central 
america officials said tuesday 
our biggest challenge in the 1990s may be working within the 
shrinking budget arthur fort assistant secretary of state for 
administration told a congressional panel 
we have identified an unfunded capital backlog in the program 
of approximately 25 billion for construction requirements to 
which we must add new demands in central america and eastern 
europe forte said 
he said those changes will place increased demand on our 
facility requirements we must respond to these new challenges with 
a fresh look at what we do and how we do it 
soaring maintenance costs high land prices in some areas and 
construction problems in other areas are also straining the budget 
officials told the panel 
rep olympia snowe rmaine asked for instance why the 
department is buying 14 acres of land in kuwait for 32 million a 
price she said seemed exorbitant 
fort agreed its a staggering price but said real estate 
prices in the oilrich persian gulf nation dictated the cost 
costs of land in kuwait are about the highest in the world 
said richard dertadian deputy assistant secretary for foreign 
buildings 
and they said if the state department fails to sign a contract 
by july the price could soar to over 40 million the united 
states cant remain where it is past 1996 because the current 
embassy site is leased 
rep mervyn dymally dcalif chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on international operations said the existing 
us embassy in kuwait is a security risk 
dymally said he recently traveled to kuwait and said that from 
his hotel room he could have shot the no 2 official in the 
embassy with a pistol 
the embassy is a ripe target for terrorist activities he 
said 
the officials told the hearing that about half of the 1 billion 
that congress allocated to the department for the worldwide embassy 
project remains unspent but they said they expect that money to be 
in the pipeline by the end of 1991 after that the department faces 
a crunch they said 
the officials said the department has 47 construction projects 
underway around the world in a renovation program that began in the 
mid1980s 
eighteen projects are in construction 18 are being designed and 
11 are in site aquisition 
the program stemmed from a worldwide review of embassy sites by 
an advisory panel looked at the condition of buildings and their 
vulnerability to attack

weekly boxoffice figures supplied by movie 
studios are sometimes as accurate as an oldfashioned chicago vote 
count say insiders including some who admit to fudging the 
numbers to get ahead 
making movies is more competitive than ever these days and the 
charts that rank them as hot or flops represent free and some 
think persuasive advertising 
so why not crunch the numbers extra hard 
its gotten really out of hand said an executive at one 
major studio who spoke on condition of anonymity i used to think 
that the independents were the only people who cheated but 
thats not true anymore 
heres how it works 
big studioslike paramount and disney and independents such as 
miramax and new line base their weekend grosses on surveys of about 
75 percent of north americas movie houses the polling for the 
most part is conducted by telephone by entertainment data inc 
but driveins spanishlanguage theaters and some small theaters 
and movie houses in hawaii are not surveyed and thats the key 
lets say ghostbusters 27 the revenge of casper collected 
45 million at the screens surveyed by edi honey i enlarged 
the kids made 43 million edi says 
estimating ticket sales from the 25 percent of theaters not 
surveyed by edi ghostbusters could report a correct final take 
of 5 million the makers of honey not wanting to land in 
second place could rewrite the figures for the 25 percent for 
their movie to show it received 51 million 
and just like that honey ads appearing in newspapers the 
next day read the nations no 1 movie 
there is a lot of temptation to want to be in the top five 
said art murphy who analyzes boxoffice figures for the trade 
publication variety 
he believes that tinkering has become commonplace but that any 
largescale manipulation would be easily detected 
said an executive from one top studio its just a little 
game you want to have a film in top 10 but its better to 
have it in the top 5 its an independent promotional vehicle 
said another studio numbercruncher sometimes the pressure is 
incredible 
every monday the studios figure up their admission estimates 
the numbers are compiled by edi and exhibitor relations co which 
relay them to a variety of news organizations including the 
associated press 
its not our job to police the studios final numbers 
said phil garfinkle edi senior vice president 
at the very least a high boxoffice placement keeps a title in 
the publics eye oscar voters might forget a film thats no longer 
on the leader board ancillary markets can be affected too a 
producer pushing a film for home video can say to prospective video 
distributors but when perry met polly did 1 million its 
first weekend 
the box office grosses are very important today as a 
promotional tool because there is a tremendous amount of public 
interest in what is hot said martin grove business columnist 
for the hollywood reporter 
creative accounting is a staple of hollywood bookkeeping but 
the boxoffice figures had always been somewhat sacred like the 
nielsen tv ratings or publishings bestseller lists 
when taurus reported not long ago that the lowbudget 
exploitation film angel town made 300000 in its opening 
weekend the figure looked strange the movie was making more 
perscreen 5455 than driving miss daisy or the steven 
seagal hit hard to kill 
how did taurus explain the films gross i added the numbers 
up seven times and i always got a different figure so i just said 
300000 said a taurus executive who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
he said the film had done solid business in driveins and 
spanishlanguage houses 
universal and fox locked horns in late february when universals 
born on the fourth of july and foxs nightbreed nearly tied 
for fifth place with born winning on the final tally both 
studios insisted the numbers were fair and cried trickery 
explained one studio executive anybody in this end of the 
business can go down those numbers and tell you whos exaggerating 
and whos not and by how much theyre exaggerating

the bush administration opened the door to a 
new more restrictive policy toward el salvador on tuesday 
agreeing in principle to link future us aid to specific progress 
toward peace and human rights 
at a senate hearing and later in private meetings with 
lawmakers secretary of state james a baker iii said the 
administration would be willing to attach strings to future aid 
including progress toward bringing to justice the killers of six 
jesuit priests their housekeeper and her daughter 
this case has got to become a turning point in the history of 
el salvador baker told the senate appropriations subcommittee on 
foreign aid our assistance is going to be affected by the way 
this case is handled its fair to say the government of el 
salvador understands that 
the secretary expanded on that offer in later private meetings 
participants said opening talks with congress aimed at crafting a 
bipartisan us policy toward el salvador where a civil war with 
leftist rebels has raged for a decade 
the administration is willing to involve themselves in 
applying some pressure to both the fmln rebels and the 
government said rep david bonior dmich a member of the 
house majority leadership that is heartening 
i think the elements for an agreement are there said rep 
william broomfield rmich the senior gop member of the foreign 
affairs committee we are very close to an agreement there is 
agreement that conditionality is important 
while participants said baker offered no specific numbers an 
administration source said he might agree to making 25 percent of 
military aid contingent on human rights and peace progress 
bakers gesture was an indication that the administration 
recognizes a growing movement on capitol hill to restrict aid to el 
salvador which amounts to 3154 million this year of that 85 
million is military aid bush has asked for 375 million next year 
90 million of it in military assistance 
a primary impetus has been the jesuit slayings nine military 
officials have been charged in the nov 16 murders but a house 
democratic task force reported monday that the investigation has 
come to a virtual standstill and that salvadoran authorities are 
reluctant to follow leads that point to involvement of higherups 
in the military 
the house foreign affairs committee voted last week to withhold 
half the military aid the aid could be restored if the fmln fails 
to work in good faith toward peace at unsponsored negotiations 
it could be cut out entirely if the government fails to make 
similar goodfaith efforts 
bonior said that formula was generally agreeable to the 
administration and to members of congress in both parties we 
agree that pressure should be applied to both sides to keep them at 
the table he said after an hourlong meeting with baker 
both sides agreed that whatever is done the us policy must be 
compatible with the unsponsored peace talks and must lead to the 
creation of political space that would allow the fmln to 
participate in national elections next march bonior said 
further meetings will be scheduled as the two sides seek to work 
out an agreement similar to the bipartisan accord that revamped 
us policy toward nicaragua a year ago

a female police dispatcher has won 
150000 in damages for years of sexual harassment by a male 
superior who once allegedly pulled down her clothing so another 
officer could photograph her bared breast 
sydney brauer 38 of macomb countys bruce township said the 
harassment by sgt robert white began in 1981 with unwanted neck 
massages then escalated into tickling unhooking of her bra and 
the 1984 photo incident 
i didnt do anything wrong brauer said but i was trying 
to change things since 1981 when it started 
an attorney for white said the incidents were goodspirited 
horseplay 
the jury award monday includes 90000 from white for harassment 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress and 30000 from 
romeo for letting the incidents continue 
the macomb county circuit court jury also ordered retired police 
chief paul uerling to pay 30000 for retaliating against her by 
criticizing her work when she filed a complaint in 1987 
the jury also awarded 11000 to anne graber 25 of romeo a 
former dispatcher who testified that white threw coins down her 
blouse and that on her birthday in 1986 white grabbed her and 
tried to kiss her passionately 
white who refused to comment about the verdict denied both 
womens charges he said the photographing incident occurred when 
he had his hand on brauers shoulder and her blouse accidentally 
slipped baring the womans breast 
brauer a 17year employee and another officer douglas wills 
testified white intentionally exposed brauers breast 
charles gerlach brauers attorney said the physical sexual 
harassment stopped only after brauer announced she was pregnant 
but verbal harassment ensued 
gerlach said white a 23year veteran of the force who lives in 
romeo made crude remarks about brauers weight gain and eating 
habits and berated her for being a working mother 
defense attorney mary cauley characterized the alleged 
harassment as horseplay 
the breast incident ended it because sergeant white thought it 
was getting out of hand cauley said it was goodspirited 
horseplay between friends she didnt object 
romeo a community of about 3500 people is about 30 miles 
north of detroit

israeli officials on tuesday offered to free 
arab prisoners in exchange for three israelis held captive in 
lebanon but indicated they would not make a deal for western 
hostages alone 
president bush said monday he had certainly no objection to 
israel freeing some of the thousands of prisoners it holds a 
goodwill gesture suggested by a tehran newspaper 
but avi pazner a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir 
said israel had received no us request for a prisoner release he 
responded certainly not when asked if he viewed bushs remarks 
as pressure 
the united states has ways to convey its opinions to us we 
are in close touch always we havent been told anything of this 
he said 
asked if israel refused to free arab detainees unless captive 
israelis were released pazner said he did not want to phrase his 
comments in a negative way 
our policy is to get our prisoners back and for that purpose 
we are ready to consider the release of people detained here he 
said 
danny naveh spokesman for foreign minister moshe arens said 
israeli captives were israels first priority our interest is to 
release our hostages he said 
three israelis were captured in lebanon in 1986 and are believed 
held by radical shiites linked to the proiranian hezbollah 
militia six americans and 10 other westerners are held hostage in 
lebanon 
the israelis are ron arad a navigator shot down over sidon and 
soldiers yossi fink and rahamim alsheikh of the armys elite givati 
brigade captured in an ambush in southern lebanon 
privately officials said they interpreted bushs comments as an 
appeal suggesting he could not make a more direct approach without 
appearing to violate his stated policy of not making deals with 
terrorists 
some also indicated shamir was feeling increasing pressure to 
assist the united states in ending the hostage ordeal the us 
government gives israel 3 billion a year in aid and they have a 
strategic cooperation agreement 
but there was no sign israel was prepared to make such a move 
it is inconceivable that israel would agree to give up on any 
of its assets in hand without israeli prisoners being part of the 
deal a senior israeli official told the mascirculation yediot 
ahronot 
a decision to free arab prisoners without getting israelis in 
return could stir angry protests as shamir tries to form a 
government that depends on rightwing nationalist and religious 
factions 
yediot ahronot quoted an arab weekly newspaper as saying israel 
had told washington there would be no release of shiite prisoners 
without a package deal that includes the captured israelis 
the most prominent prisoner israel holds is sheikh abdulkarim 
obeid a shiite moslem cleric belonging to hezbollah israel 
captured obeid and two assistants on july 28 
israel holds more than 5000 palestinians detained during the 
28month uprising against israeli rule in the occupied territories 
about 1300 are being held without trial in the ketziot prison 
located in the negev desert 
in addition more than 300 arab prisoners are held by the 
israelibacked south lebanon army at alkhiam just north of the 
israelilebanese border 
most of the alkhiam inmates are shiite moslems the bestknown 
is jawad kaswi captured in 1988 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity said israel pressured 
sla commander antoine lahd to cancel a planned release of prisoners 
for the id alfitr holiday april 26 because of publicity linking it 
to the western hostages 
apparently for the same reason israel refrained from freeing 
palestinian prisoners the release is customary during moslem 
holidays 
in recent years israel has engaged in lopsided prisoner 
releases to gain the freedom of captured soldiers the most 
controversial was the may 1985 exchange worked out with the 
prosyrian popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command 
israel won the release of three soldiers by freeing nearly 1100 
arabs many of them convicted terrorists who have since been 
rearrested for antiisraeli activism

we cannot help taking strong measures against the labor 
protests which have political overtones prime minister kang 
younghoon said tuesday after a meeting with aides and leaders of 
the governing democratic liberal party 
kang and other officials expressed concern that the already 
slumping korean economy might suffer further unless the unrest 
eases a prolonged labor dispute in 1987 slowed exports and led to 
increased unemployment 
korean exports shrank 14 percent in the first quarter this year 
and share prices on the korean stock market took the biggest 
singleday plunge ever on monday hitting an 18month low 
wages are not a main issue in the current protests workers are

slacks to press their demand for freer labor activity 
the capitals subway workers declared a twoday protest 
refusing to sell tickets and giving passengers free rides

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
tuesday that palestinian arabs would hold talks with israel only 
with the acquiesence of the palestine liberation organization 
but baker told a senate appropriations subcommittee he was not 
trying to force israel to deal with yasser arafats group 
we are not involved in a process to bring the israeli 
government into a dialogue with the plo baker said 
testifying on a wide range of foreign policy problems baker was 
questioned closely by sens robert kasten rwis and arlen 
specter rpa on whether he is trying to involve the plo in 
mideast negotiations 
that is not the case baker said 
however he added it is our view that a dialogue will not 
take place between palestinians and israel unless it is aquiesced 
in by the plo 
bakers description of only limited plo involvement in his 
efforts to arrange the talks apparently left kasten and specter 
two of israels strongest supporters in congress unconvinced 
if pressure were not applied on israel on the plo issue we 
could move ahead specter said 
he also told baker he believed the administration hoped the plo 
could be involved in some way 
i disagree baker said 
at the same time he said he intended to press on with his 
effort to arrange israelipalestinian talks 
on monday baker criticized israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir for not accepting his formula for the talks through his 
spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler baker said shamir had missed an 
opportunity to promote peace and his own initiaitve 
shamir proposed last may to hold elections among palestinians on 
the west bank and in gaza the baker formula the prime minister 
refused to endorse involved having palestinians who were ousted 
from the west bank or who resided in east jerusalem in the 
delegation 
the israeli government split over bakers approach and then 
collapsed bakers vow to keep trying to find a solution coincides 
with a continuing attempt by shamir to form a new government

rep james traficant believes us officials 
pressured a german rocket scientist to renounce his american 
citizenship rather than face charges of nazi war crimes a 
spokesman said tuesday 
arthur rudolph renounced his citizenship in 1984 under an 
agreement with the justice department rudolph said his citizenship 
was illegally obtained agreeing to leave the country and never 
return 
traficant spokesman h west richards said the ohio democrat 
believes pressure was put on rudolph to renounce his 
citizenship 
neal sher head of the office of special investigations at the 
justice department called the allegation absurd 
sher said rudolph renounced his citizenship after much 
deliberation after consulting at length with his lawyer and after 
signing an agreement in which he specifically conceded his 
involvement in nazi persecution 
the 84yearold ruldoph lives in hamburg west germany his 
supporters in huntsville ala have scheduled a may 12 event at 
which traficant will speak 
traficant is the one man in congress who has opened his eyes 
to the methods used by the osi and called them into question the 
friends of arthur rudolph said in a statement 
rudolph was brought to the united states with more than 100 
other german technicians and scientists after world war ii to help 
the united states develop space and armament programs 
he became the manager of the saturn 5 rocket program at the nasa 
space center in huntsville the rocket was used to send astronauts 
to the moon in 1969 
from 1943 to 1945 rudolph was production manager of a v2 
rocket factory attached to the doranordhausen concentration camp 
slave labor from the camp was used in the factory 
rudolph told the osi in 1983 that he knew that prisoners he 
chose to work in the underground factory died of maltreatment 
the osi contends rudolph participated under the direction of 
and on behalf of the nazi government in germany in the persecution 
of unarmed civilians because of their race religion national 
origin or political opinion 
the osi is looking into the files of other former participants 
in the rocket program to see if any of them lied about their past 
supporters in alabama some of them former nazi scientists say 
rudolph served the united states loyally and when he was no longer 
needed was intimidated and harassed until he left the country 
traficant also is championing the cause of john demjanjuk a 
retired clevelandarea auto worker condemned to death in israel 
after being convicted of committing nazi atrocities

armed settlers left a compound in the christian 
quarter of jerusalems old city before a court deadline tuesday 
and a judge sentenced the settlement movements founder to five 
months in jail for killing a palestinian 
jerusalem district court judge shalom brenner also handed rabbi 
moshe levinger a sevenmonth suspended sentence for fatally 
shooting shoestore owner kayed hassan salah on sept 30 1988 
levinger was initially charged with manslaughter which carries 
a maximum term of 20 years in prison as part of a plea bargain he 
said he was guilty to the lesser charge of causing death by 
negligence 
salah 42 was standing at the entrance to his shop when he was 
shot during a stonethrowing incident in the west bank town of 
hebron 
israeli human rights advocates say settlers have killed at least 
29 palestinians since the start of the uprising nearly 29 months 
ago only one other settler besides levinger has been sentenced to 
jail since the insurrection began in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
in jerusalems old city settler spokesmen said 50 jewish 
families had complied with a supreme court order to vacate the 
72room st johns hospice which is owned by the greek orthodox 
church 
i believe they will be back i believe in justice settler 
spokesman shmuel eviatar said as bells from the church of the holy 
sepulcher and other nearby churches pealed loudly 
greek orthdox bishop areopulos christodulos pledged to 
continue in all the courts until all the settlers get out of the 
building 
after heated arguments between the settlers and clergymen in 
black cloaks a sixmember church delegation was allowed to inspect 
the complex to confirm that all settlers who were supposed to leave 
had done so 
they evacuated the settlement except for 20 people said 
avraham sochovolsky an attorney for the church 
reporters and photographers saw settlers leave the building in 
small groups over the past few days apparently to avoid a mass 
exit that would look like a retreat 
the supreme court ruled thursday that all but 20 of the 150 
settlers who moved into st johns hospice on april 11 should leave 
by noon tuesday 
the remaining settlers act as caretakers for the panamabased 
sbc company which acquired the lease that the church contends is 
invalid the court let them stay until the tenancy dispute is 
decided 
the caretakers were later seen in the windows which were draped 
with the blueandwhite israeli flags they also unfurled one flag 
over the street 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek and senior police officials have 
warned that the settlers presence threatened to provoke violence 
in the old city which is divided into jealously guarded christian 
moslem jewish and armenian quarters 
the old city was captured from jordan in 1967 and annexed by 
israel most nations including the united states do not recognize 
israels claim to sovereignty 
major christian sects joined in an unprecedented closing of holy 
sites throughout israel on friday to protest the settlement 
the move into the old city was seen part of a broader campaign 
by rightwingers to exploit israels present political vacuum and 
push new settlement activity

the airline industry boosted a government 
program to fight aviation terrorism tuesday increasing rewards for 
information that helps stop airliner sabotage to 3 million 
the air transport association representing us carriers 
announced it would match any government reward up to 1 million if 
it involves a threat or attack against a us airline 
morris d busby state department ambassador for 
counterterrorism said rewards already have been paid in the 
governments 2 million program but he said details of the 
payments would not be disclosed 
anyone who provides information that leads to the arrest 
conviction or thwarting of an aviation terrorist could get up to 3 
million officials said in a joint news conference with 
representatives of ata state department the federal aviation 
administration and the fbi 
the reward program also includes an offer of relocation and 
other protection for witnesses officials said 
this should be a powerful incentive for people within or 
close to terrorist organizations to reveal plots before they are 
hatched said robert j aaronson ata president 
he said it would also apply to past acts including information 
about the december 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over 
lockerbie scotland that killed 270 people 
aaronson said us airlines would each contribute a share of the 
reward that would be tied to the state department reward program 
which was increased by congress last year from 500000 to 2 
million the atas 1 million also would be available through the 
fbi to match rewards designed to combat domestic air terrorism 
aaronson said 
james b busey faa administrator said the increased rewards 
send a strong message to terrorists that the united states and 
the aviation community are fully committed to this battle against 
terrorism 
bruce smith a pan american pilot whose wife ingrid died in 
the flight 103 bombing had proposed the rewards 
smith said at the news conference more has to be done to stop 
statesponsored terrorism and to get other countries to cooperate 
in antiterrorist efforts 
william baker fbi assistant director said the bureaus 
investigators are meeting every day with foreign authorities in an 
effort to keep the pressure on to solve the lockerbie bombing 
there have been no arrests or charges in the incident but 
authorities have said they believe middle east terrorists planted 
the plastic explosives inside a radio cassette player that became 
part of checkedin luggage

convicted colombian drug kingpin 
carlos lehder rivas has written manuel noriega urging the deposed 
panamanian leader to plead guilty to drug charges but pledging not 
to testify against him 
your lawyers are telling you stories to get your money you 
would be wise to talk to your old friends and formalize a 
declaration of guilt showing dignity and a sense of reality the 
letter said 
lehder 40 who prosecutors said worked with colombias medellin 
drug cartel was convicted of smuggling cocaine and is serving a 
life term plus 135 years at marion federal prison in illinois 
noriega 51 is confined in the federal metropolitan 
correctional center near miami facing drug charges which include 
accepting 46 million in bribes from the cartel 
lehder sent the associated press a copy of his letter to 
noriega dated april 18 the spanish language letter received 
tuesday bears his recognizable signature and a fingerprint and 
the envelope bears a marion ill postmark and a prison stamp an 
accompanying letter authorized release of the noriega letter 
however noriega might never see the letter mel collins an 
assistant warden at mcc said that without authorization one 
federal prisoner may not write to another and any such letter 
would be rejected at that prison 
diane cossin a spokeswoman for the us attorneys office in 
miami said prosecutors had nothing to say about the letter its 
personal correspondence from one person to another and we would 
have no comment she said 
frank rubino noriegas lead defense attorney was in trial and 
not immediately available for comment his receptionist said 
the letter chastises noriega for his onetime cooperation with 
the drug enforcement administration on several occasions noriega 
deported drug suspects to the united states even though not 
required to under panamanian law 
it is a sign of greatness for a man to recognize his errors 
the sorrow of the men of your race whom you turned over to agents 
of the dea destined for the awaiting prisons of the usa 
lehder said 
despite the criticism lehder said he will not help noriegas 
prosecutors 
i will not testify against you because despite your sins we 
are of the same fraternal latin race the letter said 
lehder also cites federal penal codes to show noriega he has no 
chance of escaping justice saying the us force that invaded 
panama on dec 20 had the right to capture and prosecute him 
you were arrested not kidnapped as i was wrote lehder who 
was seized by colombian troops in february 1987 and immediately 
flown to jacksonville to face drugsmuggling charges following a 
7monthlong trial lehder was convicted on all counts

education programs to discourage federal 
inmates from resuming drug habits after their release are being set 
up at eight federal prisons the justice department said tuesday 
as many as 975 inmates at eight federal prison facilities will 
participate in the two programs that will also provide postrelease 
supervision said michael quinlan director of the bureau of 
prisons 
the only effective drug treatment is treatment that is offered 
toward the end of the sentence and is tied into the community 
integration process quinlan told reporters 
the approach is being taken because prison officials decided 
we have a unique captive audience and we ought to take advantage 
of it quinlan said 
additionally all new federal prison inmates who have a history 
of drug abuse will be required to complete a drug education 
program quinlan said 
new inmates who refuse to participate in this program will be 
denied privileges extended to other prisoners and will be eligible 
for only the lowestpaying jobs in work programs quinlan said 
the number of federal inmates with a history of drug use has 
grown dramatically in the last decade quinlan said currently 45 
percent of the 56200 federal inmates had drug abuse problems when 
they were sentenced to prison he said 
in all the bureau of prisons expects to spend 6 million on 
drugprevention programs during the current fiscal year up from 
225 million last year quinlan said 
the new programs were announced at a press briefing a day before 
the senate labor and human resources committee was scheduled to 
question justice department officials about a cutoff of 5 million 
in drugtreatment funds to state and local prison systems 
the money which was available last year in grants to state and 
local officials was shifted to other programs during the current 
fiscal year 
clifford j white iii deputy assistant attorney general in the 
office of justice programs and gerald regier acting director of 
the bureau fo justice assistance were scheduled to be questioned 
on wednesday 
the new programs for federal prison inmates completing their 
sentences are based on the notion that a person is addicted to 
drugs regardless of whether the sentence may interrupt the ability 
to get that substance quinlan said 
if people do not learn to deal with that addiction they are 
going to return to the same life style quinlan said 
intensive 1000hour drugeducation programs have already been 
set up at federal facilities in butner nc and lexington ky an 
identical program is also planned for the federal prison in 
tallahassee fla quinlan said 
a total of 350 inmates in the last 15 to 24 months of their 
sentences will participate in the programs he said 
in september 500hour education programs will be offfered at 
prisons in sheridan ore seagoville texas rochester minn 
oxford wis and fairton nj 
the programs at each of those facilities will serve 100 to 125 
inmates each year with counseling and individual therapy

president bush asked key members of congress 
to support his 158billion space exploration package tuesday but 
was told the money will be difficult to come by in the current 
fiscal squeeze 
leaders of the committees that deal most directly with the space 
budget were supportive of bushs plans to develop the space station 
and send missions to the moon and mars but were less positive 
about prospects for the money to finance such missions 
participants said 
one said bush was told we cant make you any promises 
we have got to find a way to finance space sen howell 
heflin dala told reporters after the meeting youre going to 
have to have some identifiable sustainable source of revenue 
people are strongly supportive of space but next year and the year 
after they might not be 
heflin said that space exploration should not have to compete 
as it does now for funds that also are sought for environmental 
housing and veterans programs 
heflin mentioned user fees as one way to raise money for an 
expanded space program participants said bush was noncommittal 
about that idea 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater characterized the 
suggestions as a way to provide longterm continuous support for 
the space program as opposed to the annual appropriations process 
sen barbara mikulski dmd and chairman of the appropriations 
subcommittee covering space exploration called on bush to go 
beyond bumper stickers and big promises to support the space 
initiative 
she said congressional leaders want to meet with bushs key 
budget personnel to look for a sustainable revenue source that 
would keep the space program from having to compete in the budget 
battle every year 
in a budget that is funded year to year its very hard to 
allocate those resources that are for mission to planet earth the 
space station and then a moonmars initiative which could take 30 
years of funding she said 
bush called the meeting the first such presidential gathering 
of all the congressional leaders on financing the space program 
congress next month begins the process of writing the fiscal 1991 
federal budget 
bush made a pitch for support of his proposal to increase this 
fiscal years financing for space activities by 29 billion to 
158 billion 
vice president dan quayle the chairman of the presidents space 
council spoke with the congressional delegation about bushs 
proposal to return americans to the moon and then send a manned 
mission to mars 
separately quayle said in a speech in arlington va that 
savings from lowered defense spending should go for spacerelated 
research 
investing in space is especially important in light of the 
decline in our military spending he told the american institute 
of aeronautics and astronautics

a droughtfed brush fire was contained tuesday 
after it blackened 5500 acres of everglades grassland a park 
spokeswoman said 
it looks good said pat tolle of everglades national park 
its been confined to a few isolated areas and there are no 
active flames 
afternoon winds were light aiding forestry officials efforts 
to dump water from helicopters on the hot spots firefighters also 
were building firebreaks around the burned area 
most of the acreage burned outside the park in south dade 
county but about 1600 acres of parkland were blackened by the 
lightningsparked blaze she said 
periodic fire is critical to maintain the marsh habitat she 
said without periodic fire the hardwood trees encroach and it 
no longer functions as a wading bird habitat 
but this fire alarmed park officials because a twoyear drought 
has left vast stretches of the wetlands almost bone dry 
conditions are so extreme we want to confine it she said 
if it gets into the pinelands a fire would be very damaging 
because its so dry 
drought conditions have left the everglades so dry that 
alligators and wading birds are traveling far from their natural 
habitats to find water 
most residents in central and south florida face restrictions on 
lawn watering and home car washing and water levels in lake 
okeechobee which supplies much of the regions water have hit

three psychics and a 50000 reward didnt work 
in the end it was a veterinarian walking her dog who found the 
bones of a harvard student who vanished in 1981 
the discovery of the remains of joan webster also renewed 
questions about the role of the infamous leonard the quahog 
paradiso a smalltime hood doing time for another slaying 
paradiso never was charged in the webster case in which essex 
county district attorney kevin burke said he became a suspect 
almost immediately after webster disappeared from logan 
international airport 
the case was revived after veterinarian karen wolf last month 
stumbled across part of a skull in the woods in hamilton a wealthy 
community 25 miles north of boston 
more bones were found after that 
confirmation that the remains were websters was made monday 
authorities said the cause of death was blunt trauma to the 
head and that webster was a homicide victim 
that is some measure of relief george webster said of the 
identification he said he and his wife terry had long believed 
their daughter had been slain 
joan webster was last seen at the airport on nov 28 1981 the 
native of glen ridge nj and syracuse university graduate was 
headed back to the harvards school of design after a thanksgiving 
visit with her parents 
webster was a successful and active student who had made the 
deans list at syracuse she liked skiing sailing tennis and 
photography and had traveled widely her parents said 
the search for webster turned up her wallet 300 feet from where 
20yearold marie ianuzzis body was dumped in 1979 in saugus 
saugus is 15 miles from where the bones were found paradiso was 
convicted of ianuzzis murder in 1984 
after webster vanished her family and friends offered a 50000 
reward shortly after the disappearance three psychics came 
forward including one who said he envisioned her body was in a 
pond in manchester about five miles from where her bones were 
later found 
it was close said beverly police capt gordon richards who 
was among the investigators in 1982 
in 1985 attention focused on paradiso after a former cellmate 
alleged that the onetime fish merchant claimed involvement in 
killing webster 
timothy burke who was suffolk county prosecutor at the time 
said in an affidavit that paradiso told an informant he forced 
webster onto his 26foot cabin cruiser the malafemmina italian 
for bad woman with a fake 357caliber magnum 
according to the account he hit her on the head with a whiskey 
bottle and dumped her body in boston harbor 
many people now want to talk to paradiso 45 formerly from 
revere 
paradiso who has defended himself in the media in the past is 
not talking much he did not return a phone call tuesday and a 
spokesman for the department of correction said the walpole inmate 
refuses to speak to reporters 
it could not be immediately determined if he was currently being 
represented by an attorney his convictions include rape and 
attempted murder of a hitchhiker in 1975 as well as the 
strangulation of ianuzzi in 1979 
he was also found guilty on federal bankruptcy fraud charges for 
claiming to be worth 10 when he was working at a lobster company 
and had 10000 in the bank 
when the prison informant linked him to websters disappearance 
paradiso denied the allegations he protested his innocence in 
writing to newspapers the district attorney police and even 
websters parents 
now do you think a highclass smart girl like joan webster 
from a good family with money is going to get into a car with a 
guy like me smelling of fish he told a newspaper six years ago 
he sued boston magazine for 3 million saying he was libeled in 
a story linking him to the webster case that suit was dismissed in 
1987 by a judge who said paradisos reputation was so bad he was 
libelproof 
kevin burke the essex county prosecutor indicated paradiso 
wasnt ruled out even though finding the bones in the woods seems 
to discount the boston harbor theory 
shards of metal and glass stuck in paradisos index finger 
thought to be part of the fake gun became the subject of a 
protracted and much publicized legal battle over the inmates right 
to keep the contents of his injured finger secret he underwent 
forced surgery but it yielded no new evidence

a 4yearold boy is facing a tricky 
procedure of using umbilical cord blood from the birth of his 
sister on tuesday to help treat his rare form of leukemia doctors 
said 
michael sancilios form of leukemia afflicts less than 1 percent 
of childhood leukemia victims children with this disease 
generally survive less than a year after diagnosis said stephen 
rodgers the familys pediatrician michael was diagnosed with 
chronic myelogenous leukemia in midmarch 
normal treatment is a bone marrow transplant rodgers said but 
the chance of quickly finding a bone marrow match from a donor is 
statistically slim with so little time doctors are gambling on 
the umbilical blood transfusion 
thats where christina grace sancilio comes in she was born by 
caesarian section tuesday morning at virginia beach general 
hospital dr leslie l wasserman who delivered both christina and 
michael said the newborn is healthy and doing well 
using a syringe wasserman made two collections of umbilical 
blood one with the placenta still attached the other with the 
placenta delivered the one cup of blood is en route to indiana 
university scientists who will check to see if christinas blood 
matches michaels 
wasserman said the procedure was difficult because the surgery 
team had to ensure that none of the mothers blood contaminated the 
umbilical cord blood wasserman said a caesarian section was 
performed because of 33yearold denise sancilios difficulties in 
delivering michael 
physicians put the chances for a match at 1in4 far better 
than the 1in20000 chance of a match in the general population 
rodgers said this was the first time the experimental procedure 
would be tried for a leukemia patient 
umbilical blood contains special cells called stem cells which 
develop bone marrow in babies in their first nine months rodgers 
said christina already has the necessary stem cells to develop bone 
marrow 
if the blood matches michaels the cells will be grown in a 
laboratory at the university which pioneered the procedure for the 
treatment of some forms of anemia once scientists have grown the 
cells they will be transfused into michael after all his diseased 
bone marrow has been killed by radiation 
the cells are injected into the patients heart and act as if 
they were in a newborn heading straight for the bone to produce 
bone marrow 
we dont know what all the problems might be at this point 
said rodgers its all going to take several months and michael 
will be close to the end of his disease when we try the 
transfusion 
even if the procedure is successful rodgers said the child 
faces a lifetime of treatment to ensure the body does not reject 
the new bone marrow 
with sons michael and tony in his arms anthony sancilio 35 
tried to express his joy and hope at seeing his daughter im 
speechless im thankful the baby is healthy and hopeful that we 
will have a match he said 
tests of 7yearold tony showed he was not a compatible donor 
for his brother

defense secretary dick cheney raised the ante 
in the pentagon budget battle tuesday by extending a worldwide 
freeze on military construction and ordering 207 projects 
including navy ports in texas alabama mississippi and new york 
be reviewed for possible cancellation 
theres serious doubt about whether or not we will get the 
levels of funding from congress that will allow us to go forward 
with these programs cheney said 
the move is expected to fuel the debate between those in 
congress who want to squeeze pentagon spending and lawmakers who 
want to protect local jobs 
cheney said the freeze order which he imposed in january and 
now will last until june 15 affects more than 7 billion in new 
contracts the 207 construction projects to be reviewed are valued 
at 12 billion he said 
at a news conference cheney accused some members of congress of 
a certain amount of hypocrisy because they publicly advocate 
smaller pentagon budgets even as they lobby him in private to 
protect homestate military programs 
some of these actions may not be popular with members of 
congress who want to cut the defense budget even as they plead to 
save the projects in their own states and districts cheney said 
but when tight budgets force dedicated soldiers to turn in 
their uniforms and leave the service i cannot put construction 
projects ahead of people 
the 207 sites under study include strategic home ports in 
ingleside texas mobile ala pascagoula miss and staten 
island ny 
the majority of the projects under review are overseas many in 
west germany planned improvements or construction of hangars 
maintenance facilities family housing projects schools for 
military dependents and medical units are among the items targeted 
but several of the domestic sites targeted for study carry 
bigmoney pricetags 
the statement said that besides the four ports the review will 
also include a 110 million project at a rocket test facility at 
arnold tenn 60 million in improvements at fort hood and red 
river army depot in texas and a 37 million project at a 
consolidated maintenance facility at tooele utah 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo chairwoman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on military installations and facilities 
said she was pleased with cheneys announcement because he targeted 
overseas work she has opposed 
in recent weeks cheney has taken steps to pare the defense 
budget including cutting from 132 to 75 the number of b2 stealth 
bombers it proposes buying and sharply reducing other warplane 
programs 
citing changes in the world situation and increasing budget 
limitations cheney said significant opportunities exist to 
reduce the cost and size of the dods infrastructure 
cheneys order directs that no new construction contracts be 
awarded for projects financed under the military construction 
budget approved by congress 
the 207 construction projects will be candidates for 
rescission which means cheney may recommend that congress revoke 
the funding approved for earlier projects 
a dod statement said deputy defense secretary donald atwood will 
review construction plans for possible cancellation and submit a 
proposed list of rescissions to cheney by june 1 
cheney said that if those lawmakers who are advocating slashing 
20 billion from president bushs 3069 billion request for budget 
authority get their way more than 207 projects would have to be 
canceled 
cheney said he took the action because the freeze ran out monday 
night not because the house had scheduled a vote on a budget 
committee proposal to reduce bushs defense budget request 
on capitol hill schroeder and rep charles bennett dfla 
introduced legislation that would close the home port on staten 
island and freeze funds for construction at five other home ports 
in everett wash ingleside texas pascagoula miss mobile 
ala and pensacola fla 
the ports in everett and pensacola werent included in cheneys 
review because they are nearly completed pentagon officials said 
the gao in testimony last month before the house armed services 
subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical materials that 
bennett chairs recommended freezing spending on new home ports 
until the navy decides what it needs 
at the hearing new york mayor david dinkins said his city does 
not want the home port and cannot afford it eleven of the 
14member new york city congressional delegation and 16 members of 
the new york city council also opposed the project

president bush gave congress the final report 
tuesday on the nowlifted us sanctions against nicaragua 
calculating down to the last penny how much it cost to wage 
economic war against managuas former leftist government 
bush said it cost taxpayers exactly 130978348 for salaries 
for personnel at the departments of state and treasury and the 
national security council who administered a state of national 
emergency against nicaragua from may 1 1985 through march 13 1990 
the national emergency was declared by thenpresident ronald 
reagan who imposed tough economic sanctions against nicaragua 
including a ban on all us imports to managua and exports from 
there 
the action helped cripple the countrys economy and spawn 
dissatisfaction with the regime of daniel ortega 
bush removed the sanctions and lifted the declaration of 
national emergency on march 13 following the upset victory of 
usbacked candidate violeta chamorro in presidential balloting 
bush said her election ended the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united 
states previously posed by the policies and actions of the 
sandinista government headed by ortega

a state judge on tuesday gave texas until 
june to enact a plan to overhaul the financing of its poorer 
schools or have a plan written for it 
the 30day reprieve by district judge scott mccown freed 500 
million in state aid to schools in may and guarantees schools will 
stay open through the school year but mccown said time is running 
out 
he said the state must help the propertypoor school districts 
that challenged the current 135 billion a year system as unfair 
and won a 90 ruling from the texas supreme court 
the present scheme of public school finance is a great wrong 
the poor have waited for too long mccown said as he extended 
the state supreme courts may 1 deadline for action until june 1 
state education commissioner william kirby said the ruling gives 
the legislature and the governor one last opportunity to get 
together and come up with a plan 
kirby said he feared another legislative failure would lead to a 
courtwritten plan 
i dont think the court has the ability to put additional 
revenue into the system kirby said theres no question that 
were looking at robin hood youre really talking about taking 
from the rich giving to the poor 
lawmakers and gov bill clements failed in the second attempt to 
overhaul the current system the lawmakers proposed a halfcent 
sales tax increase to finance the overhaul and clements plans to 
veto it 
the legislatures second 30day special session on education 
ended tuesday clements immediately called another session to 
convene wednesday afternoon 
the democraticcontrolled legislature approved a 555 million 
reform plan to pay for it they proposed 114 million in budget 
cuts and raising the state sales tax from 6 cents to 6 cents on 
the dollar 
clements a republican said money should be taken from other 
state programs to fund school finance reform 
since the state failed to enact a new school system mccown 
could have stopped state payments to schools on tuesday instead 
he extended the deadline 
should clements and lawmakers fail a third time mccown also 
issued a complex set of instructions that guarantee that a new 
system of school finance is operating by sept 1 those 
instructions included 
appointment by the judge of a special master who will begin 
work this month on a finance plan of his own 
a requirement that the judge approve any state spending for 
schools after june 1 if no reform plan has been approved by 
clements and the legislature 
a june 25 judicial review of either the states plan or the 
special masters plan 
after mccowns ruling clements said he was more confident than 
ever that budget cuts not a tax increase will be used to pay for 
the plan 
i think the legislators have a different view of the situation 
than they did before because they know they cant override my 
veto clements said 
but some lawmakers sharply criticized the governor who is 
retiring sen carl parker said clements was passing the buck so he 
can leave office at the end of the year without approving a tax 
increase 
it passes the real buck the outofpocket buck to the local 
taxpayer because what we dont spend at the state level right now 
will come out of the hides of the homeowners and small business 
owners said parker chairman of the senate education committee 
texas with 1100 school districts is one of a dozen states 
where courts have overturned school finance systems deemed unfair 
to poor districts the others are kentucky new jersey kansas 
wisconsin california connecticut washington west virginia 
wyoming arkansas and montana

tens of thousands of people rallied 
nationwide tuesday to demand the removal of us military bases 
and more than 30 people were injured and scores arrested in clashes 
with police 
the protests organized by the leftist may first movement were 
the most extensive against the us bases since president corazon 
aquino took power in a popular uprising that ousted president 
ferdinand marcos in 1985 
the largest gathering was near the us embassy in manila and 
attracted 50000 protesters 
there will be no peace and democracy in the country as long as 
the us bases are here crispin beltran the movements

to march on the embassy to serve a notice of termination for 
the bases 
manila mayor mel lopez defused the situation by persuading 
protest leaders to allow him to deliver the eviction notice two 
people were arrested before lopez intervened 
opposition to the bases has been growing because many filipinos 
view them as an infringement on national sovereignty mrs aquino 
says she has not yet decided whether to support extending the lease 
after it expires in september 1991 
us and filipino negotiators will begin talks may 14 on 
extending the lease on the bases 
in angeles 50 miles north of manila filipino troops charged 
into a crowd of nearly 5000 protesters who tried to enter the gate

the head of ethiopias relief agency showed no 
interest in a military truce that would allow food supplies to 
reach starving people in his country according to a congressman 
who met with him tuesday 
rep tony hall dohio chairman of a congressional hunger 
committee said he was disappointed by his meeting with yilima 
kassaye head of ethiopias relief and rehabilitation committee 
i got the impression they care very little about their own 
people hall said in an interview it was not a good report 
clearly they put military victory above saving the lives of 
people 
kassaye told hall the sovietbacked ethiopian government 
initiated air raids on the port of massawa where food supplies 
have been blocked after rebels captured the city on feb 11 
the rebel eritrean peoples liberation front has been fighting 
for independence from ethiopia for 29 eyars 
a series of seemingly random attacks on massawa by the ethiopian 
air force began april 4 
hall said he proposed to kassaye that there be a food truce 
for three weeks so relief agencies to bring food to starving people 
in the north 
kassaye responded in essence that there was no wiggle room 
to get food through the port 
it was not a good report hall said

after a week of delays the senate on tuesday 
approved a 34 billion emergency spending bill that includes 
720 million in aid president bush wants to help the new 
democracies in panama and nicaragua 
the action on a voice vote sent the spending package to a 
conference to work out differences with a 24 billion housepassed 
version 
bush has threatened to veto the measure if negotiators leave 
intact a senate provision that would allow the district of columbia 
to use local funds to pay for abortions for poor women 
most of the new foreign aid would be offset by cuts in this 
years pentagon budget representing the first major application of 
a peace dividend from reduced eastwest tensions 
bush complained again tuesday about congress failure to enact 
his aid package saying both the house and senate had padded the 
bill with irrelevant pet spending projects and controversial 
matters 
none of it related to nicaragua none of it related to panama 
all of it related to other priorities they had the president 
told a group of small business owners at the white house 
panamanian president guillermo endara in a speech at the 
national press club was more understanding this is the price we 
pay for democracy he said of the delays its the best system 
and we want a democracy even with all the delays 
endara said his country would use the 420 million in aid to 
rebuild its battered economy and repair damage from the december 
us invasion which installed him in power but answering a 
question he said panama will not ask for more us economic aid 
next year 
by using part of the money to pay off pastdue loans to 
international banks panama would again become eligible to meet 
future financial needs through new development loans he said 
endara strongly defended the us invasion saying that human 
rights abuses by former dictator manuel noriega justified the 
intervention and he harshly criticized members of the organization 
of american states saying we were really let down when they 
did not stand up to noriega 
they were intimidated by outmoded doctrines of 
nonintervention theres a more important principle that a 
nation should be determined by the will of the people endara 
said 
during the final day of consideration the senate adopted a 
series of amendments adding 5 million to the un environment 
program 4 million to an education program for gifted and talented 
students and 5 million for the agriculture departments food 
safety inspection service 
senators also voted 73 to 24 for a nonbinding provision urging 
bush not to send to congress for approval a ussoviet trade 
agreement until moscow rescinds economic sanctions it has leveled 
at the independenceminded republic of lithuania 
in addition to the 300 million for nicaragua and the 70 
million for refugee programs bush had sought the bill already had 
become the vehicle for a host of unrelated provisions lawmakers 
added hundreds of millions for disaster relief fighting forest 
fires food stamps veterans benefits and other domestic programs 
the package also included authorization for 400 million in loan 
guarantees for israel to build housing for newly arriving soviet 
emigres 
before the measure was approved however senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan raised a series of questions about the housing 
program which he said he supported but needed to be justified for 
taxpayers 
he noted that israel already receives 3 billion a year in 
direct aid making it the largest recipient of us largesse and 
in addition gets more than 600 million in other side benefits 
dole asked whether israel should get a break on fees for the 
loan guarantees which would save the israeli government an 
estimated 25 million or more over the 30year life of the loans 
whether requirements for eligibility for the housing should be 
waived as proposed in the bill and whether the money also would 
be used to build roads and parks and pay consultants

the bush administration backed a measure 
tuesday that would triple civil fines for employers who violate 
workplace safety laws but gave only limited support to legislation 
that creates new criminal offenses 
if enacted the higher civil penalties for occupational safety 
and health administration violations would be the first increase in 
osha fines in the agencys 20year history 
labor secretary elizabeth doles call for higher fines was 
viewed by organized labor supporters as a sign shes committed to 
worker safety and that the bush administration is improving osha 
organized labor considered the agency neglected under the reagan 
administration 
it was the first time osha has taken a stand on increased 
penalties 
at a senate hearing on proposed osha changes sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio urged assistant labor secretary gerard scannell 
to reconsider the agencys opposition to his plan that creates new 
felonies for willful violations that result in serious bodily 
injury or recklessly endanger human life 
metzenbaums plan also increases from six months to 10 years the 
jail term for willful violations that result in a workers death 
metzenbaum chairman of the senate labor subcommittee called 
the current sixmonth jail term an absurdly low penalty that 
sends a message to potential violators 
it says do not worry treat worker deaths and injuries as 
just another cost of doing business metzenbaum said 
osha supports changing the crime for a violation that results in 
a death from a misdemeanor to a felony but agency officials 
believe sentencing should be left to the courts scannell said 
in addition osha objects to the two new felonies metzenbaums 
measure creates because civil penalties which often result in 
employers quickly correcting workplace hazards are easier to 
settle than criminal penalties scannell said 
the creation of two new felonies he said would damage the 
departments ability to get businesses to quickly correct those 
hazards because more employers would appeal 
expansion of the criminal provisions will come at a very high 
price not only the price of diminished civil enforcement but even 
more tragic the higher price of delayed elimination of the 
hazards scannell said 
osha also announced support for helping state and local 
prosecutors in enforcing state criminal statues in relation to 
workplace injury or deaths 
scannell said osha supports a threefold increase in civil 
penalties to bring them in line with inflation 
under a plan by sen frank lautenberg dnj the 10000 fine 
for knowingly violating osha laws would increase to 30000 while a 
lesser violation set at 1000 would increase to 3000 
business groups testified against the measures to strengthen 
osha laws saying they were vague and would harm innocent 
businessmen 
decent and respectable employers will have greater exposure to 
criminal penalties than bank robbers drug dealers and common 
criminals said kirk fordice president of the associated general 
contractors of america 
fordice complained that the legislation did not address drug use 
by employees or acknowledge the need for workers to be 
accountable for meeting minimum standards of responsibility 
an estimated 10000 workers are killed each year on the job and 
about 70000 others are permanently disabled by workplace 
accidents according to aflcio figures

frank reed malnourished but 
energetic after his 3year ordeal as a hostage in lebanon 
celebrated his freedom tuesday with a beer a large steak and a 
longawaited reunion with his wife and son 
a special state department team began questioning the 
57yearold educator at the us air force hospital in wiesbaden 
hoping for clues about the 16 remaining western hostages in 
lebanon six american hostages are still held 
reed who said he spent much of his captivity blindfolded is 
the second american hostage freed since april 22 
in malden mass reeds daughter said he told her he had been 
held with american hostages terry anderson and thomas sutherland 
but was separated from them about a year ago anderson and 
sutherland are among the six remaining us hostages in lebanon 
he was disturbed that they werent out he thought for sure 
they would have been released said marilyn langston 33 she 
said reed called her early tuesday from the military hospital in 
west germany 
mrs langston said her father said he lost 60 pounds during his 
43 months in captivity 
at the hospital reeds doctors performed xrays and blood tests 
and said the former captive showed no initial signs of serious 
medical problems 
reed lost significant weight and muscle mass from a lack of 
exercise and a marginal diet the doctors said in a statement 
they added reed is weak and tired but otherwise feels 
well and is talking with family and medical staff the hospital 
said reed had indicated he did not want to meet with reporters 
tuesday 
reed was reunited at the hospital tuesday morning with his 
syrian moslem wife fahima 39 and their 9yearold son tarek 
who had arrived from the united states where they had been staying 
in his hometown of malden mass 
military officials said reeds wife and son went on a quick 
shopping tour to buy new clothes for him at the nearby us lindsey 
air base 
reed displayed a healthy appetite and a strong thirst for beer 
according to the hospital staff 
for lunch reed requested a heineken beer and a large steak 
cooked medium rare and the freed hostage got what he asked 
for the hospital statement said 
he spent the afternoon sleeping and was to have dinner with his 
family hospital officials said 
in washington president bush called reeds release joyous 
news but said he wouldnt be satisifed until all the remaining 
hostages are freed 
bush who met at the white house tuesday with democratic and 
republican leaders praised syria and iran for exerting pressure on 
the shiite moslem fundamentalist hostagetakers 
but the president also prodded the two countries to work for the 
release of more hostages emphasizing they should not expect normal 
relations or vast improvement until all americans are freed 
when a step is taken that goes toward that day when all 
hostages are released i should say thank you bush said but 
beyond that i cant say that i can be happy 
anderson the chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longestheld western hostage in lebanon he was 
abducted march 16 1985 
bush said he would not object if israel were to release shiite 
prisoners as the lebanese hostagetakers have demanded 
israeli officials reacting to the indirect us appeal 
insisted that israel wanted three israeli soldiers captured in 
lebanon in 1986 to be part of any deal the three are believed held 
by radical shiites linked to the proiranian hezbollah militia 
a leading iranian newspaper the tehran times said tuesday that 
irans leaders expect a reciprocal gesture of good will from 
washington if another us hostage is to be freed 
the newspaper said iran and the lebanese militants expect 
washington and its allies to pressure israel into releasing a 
significant number of detainees specifically sheik abdulkarim 
obeid a shiite cleric abducted by israel in southern lebanon in 
july 
bush met monday with former hostage robert polhill who was 
freed on april 22 the president said polhill had given him a 
secret message from his captors but refused to disclose its 
contents 
reeds kidnappers who called themselves the organization of the 
islamic dawn announced before reeds release that he would be 
carrying a message to president bush 
reed who had been principal of a private school in beirut since 
1977 refused to comment on any message he was kidnapped sept 9 
1986 
he was released monday night into syrian hands in west beirut 
and then escorted to damascus just as polhill was last week 
reed blew kisses flashed a v for victory sign to 
wellwishers and touched the ground in undisguised elation after 
arriving in brilliant sunny weather tuesday at rheinmain air base 
from syria on a us air force c141 transport plane 
he was then flown by army helicopter to the hospital in nearby 
wiesbaden 
reed still bearded and wearing a dark suit and white shirt 
walked with relatively brisk steps from the helicopter smiling 
broadly 
he gave a thumbsup to reporters and about 170 military and 
medical personnel waiting for him at the hospital 
banners draped over the hospital balconies proclaimed welcome 
back to the free world and welcome home mr reed 
at the hospital reed was provided with a new pair of reading 
glasses officials said 
after his release reed said that during his lonely and 
boring captivity he had been shut off from news of the outside 
world and sometimes didnt even know what month it was 
officials said reed would probably remain at the hospital for 
the next two to three days before returning to the united states

the report released on the eve of a congressional hearing on a 
bill to pay benefits to agent orange victims produced no new 
evidence rather it reviewed existing studies 
lawmakers pushing the benefits praised the study by the agent 
orange task force seven scientists assembled by the american 
legion vietnam veterans of america and the national veterans legal 
services program 
it is not only appropriate but it is scientifically correct 
to award compensation to vietnam veterans exposed to the 
dioxincontaining defoliant said sen john kerry dmass a 
vietnam veteran and sponsor of senate legislation to award 
compensation 
the report said proof exists of a significant statistical 
association between herbicide exposure and nonhodgkins 
lymphoma softtissue sarcoma chloracne and other skin disorders 
early liver disease and porphyria cutanea tarda a metabolic 
disorder 
the scientists also said there was enough evidence to give the 
benefit of the doubt in awarding compensation to veterans who were 
exposed and suffer from hodgkins disease neurologic and 
reproductive problems and developmental problems with their 
offspring 
they say theres limited evidence of an association between 
exposure and a large number of cancers as well as immunological 
abnormalities and psychological problems 
a senate bill has been passed and a house bill introduced to 
provide benefits to veterans who claim their diseases were a result 
of exposure the bills differ in cost 36 million for the senate 
version and 89 million for the house version length of coverage 
and number of diseases covered 
a veterans affairs subcommittee was scheduled to hear testimony 
wednesday on the house bill sponsored by rep lane evans dill a 
cochairman of the vietnamera veterans in congress 
both bills would create an independent panel of scientists under 
the auspices of the independent national academy of sciences to 
review herbicide studies critics say the government has 
intentionally tried to influence the evidence on agent orange to 
avoid paying benefits 
va secretary edward j derwinski has decided to award benefits 
to nonhodgkins lymphoma sufferers who served in vietnam that 
decision was made march 29 as the result of a study by the centers 
for disease control 
about 35000 veterans have filed claims asserting a connection 
between exposure and a variety of ailments only a handful those 
for chloracne have been granted 
about 240000 veterans believe they may have been exposed to the 
herbicide and have requested physical examinations va says a 
total of 12 million gallons of agent orange was sprayed during the 
war to remove ground cover and crops 
agent orange is a phenoxyacetic herbicide contaminated with 
dioxin during manufacture dioxin is the main diseasecausing 
suspect 
the environmental protection agency has labeled dioxin a 
probable human carcinogen 
the scientists on the panel say an influential private study of 
nitro wva monsanto workers exposed to dioxin has been 
discredited because of allegations of scientific fraud so has an 
important study of industrial workers in ludwigshafen west 
germany they said 
the scientists were especially critical of the va and cdc for 
ignoring animal studies especially because agencies such as the 
epa gives them such strong consideration 
va scientists say the animal dioxin studies are less reliable 
because of the variety of reactions from species to species and 
because there is documented human exposure said va spokeswoman 
donna st john 
the two bills cover only a few of the ailments nonhodgkins 
lymphoma softtissue sarcoma melanoma and chloracne the house 
version adds melanoma and basal cell carcinoma 
oliver meadows the chairman of the vas outside environmental 
hazards advisory committee dismissed criticism in the new report 
that it ignored a large number of studies and that it used a 
simplistic tallying system to weigh data 
the panel has only examined the connection between agent orange 
and nonhodgkins lymphoma the new report covers all the possible 
ailments 
the panel found in november that an association cannot be proved 
or disproved the va panel meets later this month to consider other 
cancer studies 
the cdc study of six kinds kinds of cancer found an increased 
risk of only one nonhodgkins lymphoma among vietnam veterans 
it found no such increase in soft tissue sarcoma hodgkins 
disease and nasal nasopharyngeal and primary liver cancer 
the study looked only indirectly at agent orange exposure

riot police on horseback and on foot charged 
a may day march near the center of mexico city with clubs swinging 
leaving several demonstrators bleeding with head wounds 
the marchers represented a group of independent unions headed 
for the main plaza or zocalo as a larger demonstration by 
progovernment unions was dispersing 
police held up the march apparently waiting for the other 
groups to leave then charged it was not clear what set off the 
attack during which some marchers hurled bricks and rocks at 
police 
the procession later left for the plaza as demonstrators carried 
away the wounded the number of injured was not immediately clear 
the mexican government news agency notimex said three policemen 
and four journalists mostly mexican photographers were injured 
but associated press reporters saw several others who had been 
beaten 
in the plaza the marchers hauled down from a building a huge 
banner from a progovernment labor group and set it afire 
at least three major labor groups declined to join the official 
rally of the mexican labor federation in the zocalo several 
independent unions held separate marches to the plaza 
among the chants shouted was aware worker dont give up 
dont sell out 
ranks of members of progovernment unions had marched around the 
huge square past the national palace to greet the president carlos 
salinas de gortari then marched out unofficial estimates put the 
number of marchers at around 200000 
some in the mexican labor federation demonstration said they had 
to attend it is forced said a worker from an automobile brake 
plant who demanded anonymity if you dont go they will discount 
two days from your salary 
about 10000 other marchers from nongovernmentaligned unions 
headed for the zocalo as the mexican labor federation demonstration 
dispersed 
two groups marched past the us embassy shouting gringo 
thieves to the firing squad 
we are hungry read a banner carried by workers in the 
treasury department 
the mexican electrical workers union said it would not take 
part in the ctm rally because it did not want to risk incidents 
resulting from the unrest there is among the workers the 
weekly proceso said monday the revolutionary workers federation 
was boycotting to protest what it said were low wages 
the teachers union mexicos largest said it would stay home 
but a dissident movement that claims support of about half the more 
than 1 million members called one of the three separate 
demonstrations 
behind the demonstrations walked 10 city sanitation workers with 
brooms and bright orange uniforms one of them domingo rendon 
sighed the day of the worker means more work for us 
for decades fidel velazquez the 90yearold head of the 
mexican labor federation and a stalwart of the governing 
institutional revolutionary party defused labor unrest and turned 
out the vote for the party 
with national economic crisis workers have lost ground and with 
it patience with their leaders and the system 
the labor federation has at various times claimed a membership 
of as many as 5 million labor analysts estimate it at about half 
of that

the bush administration wants to forgive some 
of the 117 billion owed by more than 70 countries for us food 
aid officials told congress tuesday 
it has still to decide how much would be forgiven and which 
countries would benefit 
william c ramsay deputy assistant secretary of state for 
energy resources and food policy said they would be the poorest 
countries if they have promised the world bank or the 
international monetary fund to undertake new policies 
the last requirement would exclude egypt for example which 
owes the most 26 billion egypt has been negotiating with the 
fund for years but has so far found its terms too difficult 
south korea which still owes over 600 million is too well off 
for debt forgiveness according to an official of the us agency 
for international development 
most of the beneficiaries would be african countries to which 
bush has already promised forgiveness of 1 billion worth of other 
debt ramsay said poor countries outside africa such as bangladesh 
and haiti may also win forgiveness of the food debt 
bangladesh owes over 1 billion for food aid as do indonesia 
and pakistan 
ramsay also asked for authority to make more grants of food aid 
instead of loans on generous terms many countries in urgent need 
of food aid have such large debt service burdens and weak economies 
that they can no longer afford even these generous terms he said 
ramsay testified before the subcommittee on international 
economic policy of the house foreign affairs committee which is 
considering bills that would allow the debt forgiveness envisioned 
by ramsay 
the chairman of the subcommittee rep sam gejdenson dconn 
said he was sympathetic to the administrations plans for debt 
forgiveness

the government tuesday offered to meet 
opposition parties threatening to boycott romanias first free 
elctions in more than 50 years 
the move follows the accusation by five major opposition parties 
that the national salvation front which dominates the provisional 
governing coalition is monopolizing power the opposition parties 
on monday threatened to boycott the may 20 elections 
the government offer also comes as a roundtheclock 
antigovernment protest in bucharest entered its 10th day 
the goverment said claims that the national salvation front was 
harassing opposition activists and using facilities left by the 
deposed communist party can be discussed with representatives of 
the government to eliminate any kind of suspicions and to 
improve some organizational aspects of the elections 
the statement said the goverment would guarantee the equality 
of chances from a technical point of view for all parties 
contesting the election 
the five opposition parties that are threatening to boycott the 
elections are the national peasants party the national liberal 
party the social democrat party the free democrat party and the 
socialist liberal party 
there was no immediate response from the parties to the 
goverment statement 
in bucharest 8000 protesters gathered in downtown university 
square to protest against the government of interim president ion 
iliescu which they claim favors preserving communism iliescu is a 
former communist official who became a critic of ceausescus in 
recent years 
organizers of the anticommunist protest said they have 
collected 4 million signatures for a petition to exclude all former 
communists from politics and government there was no way to 
independently verify their claim 
the national salvation front began ruling as an interim 
government shortly after the december revolution that deposed 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu it then brought in opposition 
figures to form a coalition government but remained the dominant 
force 
on tuesday the crowed stood singing and chanting under a giant 
banner that read iliescu go back to where you came from 
twentyone people said they had started a fast to enforce the 
rallys demands 
nicolae trifu a bank official from ploeisti 30 miles north of 
bucharest said the government should end its control of the 
staterun network 
television should no longer be subordinated to the government 
and to iliescu in particular he told the crowd 
his comments were greeted with a sea of v for victory signs 
and chants of resign resign and down with iliescu 
opposition parties have long complained that the national 
salvation front has an unfair advantage in the elections because of 
its domination of the television network 
reporters in the western city of timisoara where the revolution 
began said about 1000 antiiliescu demonstrators assembled 
tuesday for a protest there were no other details

advocates of a centralized 
commandandcontrol economy hiding behind the green mask of 
environmentalism are threatening to undermine americans self 
confidence and pioneering spirit budget director richard darman 
warned tuesday 
even though the conflict between western democracies and 
communist bloc nations is in decline different economic ideologies 
both labeled environmentalism will continue to compete for 
dominance darman said in a speech at harvard university a text of 
which was released in washington 
he identified two kinds of environmentalism progrowth 
marketoriented pluralistic environmentalism and antigrowth 
commandandcontrol centralistic enviromentalism 
because so many people are selfproclaimed 
environmentalists the label is no longer a meaningful 
characteristic it is a green mask under which different faces of 
politicoeconomic ideology can hide he added 
the budget director said americans must counter the tendency 
to become a riskophobic society because prudent risktaking is 
central to the us spirit and standard of living 
if we were to regulate houses with the same principles we now 
apply to our food and air for example we would all have to live 
in singlestory homes for fear of falling down stairs he said 
darman along with white house chief of staff john sununu are 
viewed as the two senior white house aides most skeptical of 
strengthening regulation of the environment and have argued in 
support of toning down presidental statements on global warming and 
other environmental problems

the purchasers in the biggest savings and loan 
bailout of 1988 are enjoying millions of dollars of riskfree 
profits and regulators should renegotiate the deal sen howard 
metzenbaum said tuesday 
the ohio democrat said a federal home loan bank of dallas memo 
obtained by his senate judiciary subcommittee on antitrust shows 
taxpayers likely would have been better off if regulators 
liquidated first gibraltar bank of houston rather than bailing it 
out in december 1988 
the federal home loan bank board then the chief regulator of 
thrift institutions estimated it would have cost 5 billion to 
shut down the five bankrupt thrifts that were combined to form 
first gibraltar 
however a memo prepared in february 1989 by analyst jeff potter 
in dallas said the liquidation cost was grossly overstated by 
about 16 billion metzenbaum said indicating the sale may have 
been unnecessary 
instead of liquidating the bank board pledged 5 billion in 
future aid and 12 billion in tax benefits to new york financier 
and revlon chairman ronald o perelman and other investors who put 
up 315 million 
including the tax benefits first gibraltar now the largest 
thrift in texas and among the 20 largest in the nation enjoyed the 
best return on investment of any thrift in the nation last year 
according to metzenbaums aides 
it received 461 million in federal assistance in 1989 enabling 
it to post a profit of 129 million the senator said 
these overly generous payments are government guarantees that 
give little incentive to manage the assets of the sampl profitably 
they also suggest that the government drove a very poor bargain 
for taxpayers metzenbaum said in a letter to l william seidman 
chairman of the resolution trust corp which has assumed 
responsibility for reviewing the 1988 bailouts 
metzenbaum said the findings of his staff which reviewed 35000 
documents related to the 1988 deals dramatically underscore 
the need to renegotiate the first gibraltar sale and other 
transactions 
our investigation has found evidence that bidding on several 
deals was irregular and done in haste billions in federal 
subsidies and thrift assets were juggled in a rush to close as many 
deals as possible before the end of 1988 he wrote 
first gibraltar chairman gerald j ford defended his 
institutions deal with the government saying it was concluded 
after a vigorous and highly competitive auction 
he said his sampl has restored stability and depositor confidence 
to the texas thrift industry through a forwardlooking program of 
assets management branch consolidation and operating 
efficiencies 
federal regulators at the time of the 1988 deals defended the 
transactions as the best they could do because they lacked the 
cash to pay off depositors they were forced to keep insolvent 
institutions afloat by pledging future assistance they said

about 10500 soviet jews arrived in israel in 
april the largest monthly figure since the start of a mass soviet 
immigration to the jewish state last year an official said tuesday 
it was the first time israel published a figure for soviet 
arrivals since early march when such statistics were censored in 
response to arab guerrilla threats to attack immigrants 
gad ben ari the spokesman for the quasigovernmental jewish 
agency which is partly responsible for resettling the immigrants 
said 10500 arrived in april he added israels goal is to bring 
the maximum amount of people in the minimum amount of time 
before april the monthly immigration figure for soviet jews was 
between 4000 and 6000 israeli and foreign reports said in 1989 
12000 soviets settled in israel and in 1988 only 2000 arrived 
the relaxation in the censorship of immigration statistics 
appears to be a result of pressure from overseas fundraisers 
particularly those in the united states fundraisers say they need 
the immigration figures in their drives to raise money to absorb 
the newcomers 
israeli officials estimate up to 300000 soviet jews will 
emigrate to israel in the next few years the influx comes because 
of a loosening of immigration procedures in the soviet union and 
tighter restrictions on us immigration

an angry judge ordered zsa zsa 
gabor to perform 60 extra hours of community service tuesday 
saying fund raising at her belair mansion was not the way to serve 
time for slapping a policeman 
if there is any violation of probation county jail will be 
the sanction warned municipal court judge charles rubin 
he asked miss gabor if she accepted his decision 
yes what can i do miss gabor said 
you could go to jail do you want that the judge shot back 
yes i accept miss gabor said referring to the community 
service hours 
its outrageous the former hungarian beauty queen later 
told about 80 reporters 
miss gabor 72 was sentenced last year to 120 hours of 
community service on her conviction of slapping a beverly hills 
motorcycle policeman who stopped her rollsroyce last june for 
expired registration tags 
rubin originally ordered her to do the service at the lower 
income elderly united community assistance program in venice with 
the time to be completed by march 30 
rubin ordered tuesdays hearing after he received a sparse 
account from the shelters executive director vera davis about 
how miss gabor spent her time 
davis said miss gabor spent about 50 hours at the shelter and 
the rest of the time working from her belair mansion organizing a 
june 8 fundraiser for the shelter 
its clear to me the defendant had a rather lax attitude about 
it rubin said 
it means nothing to miss gabor buying community service 
hours she is a wealthy person rubin said after meeting with 
miss gabor and her attorney harrison bull for 3 hours the 
primary motive was miss gabors promotion and not fund raising 
i repeated numerous times at the original sentencing that 
she perform community service at the center 
miss gabor later told reporters i served food why do i have 
to promote myself im so damned famous its sickening 
rubin gave miss gabor credit for 34 hours of community service 
time from her 120hour sentence he ordered her to serve the 
remaining 85 hours plus 60 penalty hours 
miss gabor must now document her community service time and 
there will be random inperson verification the judge said 
the remaining 145 hours must be completed by sept 28 and the 
hours will be served at several agencies 
you may not do any fund raising as a part of the community 
service the judge ordered 
i dont have any qualms with miss gabors assistance and fund 
raising said deputy district attorney elden fox but there is 
an aspect of humility that goes along with this 
he said community service usually includes handling telephones 
or serving food

millions of students interested in mathematics 
have dropped out for other careers a national research council 
report said tuesday in calling for renewed commitment to math 
education 
the attrition rate for students in the mathematical sciences 
is 50 percent per year the highest among all scientific fields 
said the report renewing us mathematics critical resources 
for the future 
bright young people are discouraged from pursuing careers in 
the mathematical sciences because they find their career prospects 
are dim 
the report said there were about 36 million ninth grade 
mathematics students in 1972 by the time they entered college as 
freshmen in 1976 the number had dropped to 294000 in 1980 11000 
won bachelors degrees in mathematics two years later 2700 
masters degrees were awarded and 400 doctorates were bestowed in 
1986 
professors must show students that the mathematical sciences 
offer both intellectual excitement and attractive career 
prospects said the report providing intellectual excitement 
is the responsibility of the mathematical sciences community 
to perceive attractive career prospects students must see in 
their own mathematics departments active successful research 
enterprises that involve graduate students young faculty and 
senior researchers all supported at levels competitive with those 
in the other sciences and engineering 
a key recommendation of the report is that federal support of 
mathematics education increase to 250 million annually from 133 
million over the next three years 
the report is a follow up to a 1984 study which called for 180 
million a year the committee that produced the report said that 
inflation had pushed that amount to 225 million 
the money should be used mostly to increase the numbers of 
senior junior and postdoctoral researchers and graduate research 
assistants the committee said 
edward david jr chairman of both the 1984 and the present 
study committee said that i think we would be much closer to 
realizing the goal of president bush and the nations governors of 
becoming first in math and science if all of the 1984 suggestions 
had been carried out 
the chances are very good that the new report will be fully 
supported because of the attitude of the president congress and 
the governors said david we got everybody on our side and 
chances are very good

lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene 
said tuesday that the cities of moscow and leningrad have agreed to 
help lithuania ease the pressure of the soviet unions economic 
embargo on the rebellious republic 
she did not say what practical help was offered but the baltic 
republic of 38 million people sent a delegation to leningrad last 
week to talk with local officials about a direct exchange of goods 
either for hard currency or barter 
mrs prunskiene told reporters outside the ontario legislature 
that reform municipal councils in leningrad moscow and elsewhere 
in the soviet union offered to assist lithuania because they rely 
on it for food supplies 
because of the kremlins blockade we have taken the intiative 
for direct contact with these cities she through an interpreter 
these people think the way we do and we consider them our 
friends not only do they support our independence initiatives but 
they also want to cooperate with us in practical terms because they 
receive many of their food supplies from us 
mrs prunskiene is in canada as part of a north american swing 
to ask for more economic ties with her republic she is to meet 
thursday with president bush at the white house 
lithuania has struggled for two weeks since the soviets cut 
supplies of fuel medicine and other goods following lithuanias 
march 11 declaration of independence 
the kremlin does not recognize the declaration saying lithuania 
must follow soviet law on secession 
lithuania was forcibly incorporated into the soviet union in 
1940 
mrs prunskiene said she is confident lithuania will get help 
from other soviet republics and regions 
the only way that this could be prevented or stopped would be 
by armed intervention but it is very doubtful whether any nation 
can solve its economic problems with the use of force she said 
at a luncheon of ontario government officials with ontario prime 
minister david peterson 
mrs prunskiene said she is in canada with a trade delegation 
seeking to establish closer economic ties not to look for charity 
peterson said the province will likely send a trade delegation 
to lithuania this year 
on monday in ottawa mrs prunskiene said her government is 
prepared to suspend some items in its independence declaration to 
open negotiations with the soviet union she made clear on tuesday 
that lithuania will not sacrifice its goal of independence 
the act of independence is untouchable she said 
since lithuania declared its independence canada has urged 
negotiations and dialogue between the two sides 
mrs prunskiene returns to lithuania on saturday

a federal judge said tuesday he would allow 
sworn videotaped statements from two key defense witnesses in the 
philippines to be introduced at imelda marcos fraud trial 
mrs marcos attorneys say one of the witnesses orlando dulay 
will testify that he was present when ferdinand marcos recovered a 
hoard of gold known as the yamashita treasure and that he helped 
transport the gold to marcos home 
the yamashita treasure was a huge cache of gold supposed to have 
been hidden in the philippines by gen tomoyuki yamashita the 
japanese military commander stationed there in the closing days of 
world war ii 
marcos who died in exile in hawaii last september claimed that 
the gold was the primary source of his wealth no evidence of the 
gold has ever been found 
proof of this serendipitous discovery would be offered to 
refute the governments contention that marcos amassed his wealth 
through systematic plundering of the philippine treasury us 
district judge john f keenan said in a written ruling 
the judge also approved the taking of a deposition from fransico 
tantuico who was in charge of the philippine audit organization 
between 1976 and 1986 tantuico will testify that reports prepared 
by his department disprove allegations of corruption by the 
marcoses 
mrs marcos 60 is accused of helping her late husband loot the 
philippine treasury of more than 220 million to buy new york 
properties and support lavish living 
her codefendant saudi financier adnan khashoggi is charged 
with helping the marcoses conceal their ownership of four new york 
buildings and artworks purchased with the allegedly stolen funds 
keenan said lawyers for mrs marcos can interview the witnesses 
in the philippines during the second week of june when the trial 
will be in recess the videotaped statements will then be shown to 
jurors 
the judge denied a motion to allow mrs marcos to go to the 
philippines with her attorneys he also ruled against allowing her 
lawyers to interview president corazon aquino who ousted marcos 
and numerous other potential defense witnesses 
keenan said defense claims that the us and philippine 
governments were hectoring and intimidating potential defense 
witnesses in the philippines appear exaggerated 
the aquino government has refused to let mrs marcos return 
since she and her husband left the country after marcos defeat as 
president in february 1986 
testimony tuesday focused on the alleged embezzlement of funds 
in the philippines 
one witness said the chief of the agency that handled japanese 
war reparations to the philippines took commissions that were 
deposited into swiss bank accounts held by marcos 
andres genito a former employee of two japanese trading 
companies said he made the payments to gen eugenio balao a close 
marcos associate who was in charge of the war reparations 
commission from 1966 until it expired in the mid 1970s 
i jokingly told him general balao that this is a large sum 
of money is it for you he said are you kidding this goes to 
president marcos said genito who now owns a liquor store in 
los angeles 
the witness testified that he accompanied balao on numerous 
occasions to hong kong where the general converted the commissions 
from japanese yen to us dollars genito said balao told him he 
deposited the money into swiss accounts held by marcos 
genito said he made the payments during all the years balao 
served on the reparations commission but he did not say how much 
money was involved

the house on tuesday adopted the democrats 
12 trillion federal budget for next year making deep cuts in 
president bushs defense plans and channeling much of the savings 
into social programs 
before the vote democrats taunted the republicans for 
abandoning the administrations own spending plan 
meanwhile senate budget committee chairman james sasser finally 
lined up enough votes for his committee to approve a budget of its 
own a congressional source said 
until now solid gop opposition and several balking democrats 
have prevented the panel from drawing up a spending package but 
sen charles robb dva told sasser he would support a plan that 
claims to reduce next years deficit by 43 billion said the 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
that would produce a majority on the panel for the proposal 
which could approve a budget as early as wednesday the plan would 
allow 294 billion for defense spending officials said 
on a 218208 largely partyline vote the democraticcontrolled 
house adopted a plan that would provide 2955 billion for next 
years military programs that is 83 billion less than bush 
proposed and 115 billion below the amount needed to keep pace 
with inflation a step supporters said was merited by eased 
tensions with the soviet bloc 
the budget here provides for a transition from a cold war 
economy to a peacetime economy and that is what we need to do for 
the future said the plans chief architect house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
republicans opposed the package en masse with all 174 gop 
lawmakers who cast ballots voting against it they criticized it as 
weak on defense and argued that any budget will be meaningless 
unless negotiations with the white house first yield agreements on 
its components 
they were joined by 34 democrats who voted against the measure 
this is the dukakis platform this is the mondale platform 
this is the carter presidency this is the mcgovern movement 
said rep newt gingrich rga the no 2 gop leader recalling the 
ghosts of the recent democratic past 
but much of the debate centered on the republican decision not 
to offer bushs own spending blueprint for a vote reversing a 
customary practice rep bill frenzel of minnesota ranking 
republican on the house budget committee revealed the change of 
heart late monday saying the presidents package had been passed 
by by economic and political events 
perhaps that speaks louder than even offering the presidents 
budget said panetta to govern is to choose not to run and 
hide not to cop out 
frenzel replied in our judgment leadership required meeting 
with the president two months ago to negotiate a compromise 
budget 
realizing they would not be able to rely on any gop support 
democrats brought speaker thomas s foley dwash to the floor 
he rallied his members by asking them to show that we can march 
not drift into the next century 
aiming to reshape bushs defense plans the democratic budget 
places longrange constraints on pentagon spending 
the plan shrinks defense budget authority to 283 billion 24 
billion less than bush budget authority is the amount of spending 
the pentagon can commit itself to for programs that may last 
several years such as the purchase of a warship limiting that 
figure would necessitate future cuts in defense 
the house package would spend 2243 billion 56 billion more 
than bush on dozens of domestic and foreign aid programs ranging 
from grants to scientists to protecting abused children 
the plan seeks to slash 36 billion from next years deficit 
the same amount proposed by bush but with a different mix both 
sides would rely on 139 billion in new tax receipts but the 
president wants higher savings from benefit programs while 
democrats rely more on defense cuts 
this years shortfall is expected by the nonpartisan 
congressional budget office to reach 158 billion but under the 
budget processs peculiar mathematics the proposed cuts would 
enable lawmakers to meet the grammrudman laws requirement for a 
1991 budget gap of no more than 64 billion the 1991 fiscal year 
begins oct 1 
the government will have to pay 183 billion in interest next 
year on the 3 trillion national debt nearly 15 percent of all 
federal spending 
before final passage the house rejected by 33490 a budget 
offered by the liberal congressional black caucus it would have 
limited defense spending to 2795 billion and boosted spending for 
housing education and other domestic programs 
the budget maps the governments fiscal plans for the year but 
leaves binding spending and tax decisions for later bills

message to gorbachev on the occasion of the may day workers 
holiday ms kalendra said and noted with irony that some

impossible without the support and help of republics within the 
soviet union 
later tuesday she said new reform city governments in leningrad 
and moscow have offered to help lithuania with the embargo 
not only do they support our independence initiatives but they 
also want to cooperate with us in practical terms because they 
receive many of their food supplies from us she said through an 
interpreter 
the leader of latvias promoscow communist party alfred 
rubiks told a may day rally that the party was alarmed at recent 
calls for secession from the soviet union riga radio reported

and their leaders are heedless of the tragic consequences of such a 
step for the fate of the peoples of latvia they are heading for an

the united states needs a policy to help 
keep the lights burning in hong kong because chinese leaders 
want firm control over the city rather than prosperity when they 
take over from britain outspoken hong kong legislator martin lee 
said tuesday 
when chinese leaders feel insecure as now they want to 
control the country first and likewise to control hong kong so 
the economy becomes of secondary importance he said in a speech 
at the heritage foundation a conservative policy research and 
advocacy group 
lee a member of the hong kong legislative council has been 
giving a pessimistic forecast on hong kongs future at meetings 
with us government officials and members of congress and in 
lecture and television appearances 
britain and china in 1984 agreed that the british colony will 
rejoin china in 1997 when britains lease expires but retain its 
private enterprise economy and certain other autonomy for at least 
50 years 
with british influence waning and emigration from the colony 
swelling there needs to be a us policy upholding democracy 
human and economic freedoms for hong kong he said 
if you allow the lights to be switched off in 1997 im afraid 
it will affect not only hong kong and china but also the pacific 
rim he said it would be better for the free world to keep 
this international city afloat to keep the heart beating in hong 
kong well beyond 1997 rather than being faced with having to take 
our people as refugees because that is a distinct possibility 
the chinese democracy movement crushed last june and the 
collapse of communist regimes in eastern europe have prompted grave 
concern by the chinese leadership for its own security already 
reflected in a hardline stand in framing the post1997 basic law 
for hong kong recently approved in beijing he said 
china is quite happy to see hong kong being an outlet for her 
products and a window to the free world where she can convert her 
currency he said but in beijings view thats good enough 
hong kong need not be such an important place as today when it 
ranks as the worlds 11th largest trading entity 
in the view of the chinese leadership if hong kong should 
lose its prosperity it doesnt matter provided it doesnt pose a 
threat said lee

torture of civilians by burmas security forces is 
widespread and anyone criticizing or even suspected of opposing the 
military government is at risk amnesty international said 
wednesday 
the worldwide human rights organization said it had new evidence 
from recently released political prisoners refugees and other 
sources that torture thought to have been limited to areas of armed 
ethnic conflict is rife throughout the country 
in its may newsletter amnesty international said at least six 
military and civilian security agencies operating in more than a 
dozen centers have been routinely torturing detainees for two years 
the security forces seem to have almost unrestricted authority 
to carry out arbitrary arrests to detain prisoners incommunicado 
for months without charge or trial and to interrogate them using 
torture amnesty international said 
it said thousands of people have been killed in prodemocracy 
demonstrations and following the september 1988 military coup 
thousands more were arrested for nonviolent political activities 
burmese authorities have not responded to repeated requests by 
amnesty international to visit the country to discuss its concerns 
the organization said 
amnesty international said the torture usually takes place early

a federal judge tuesday night halted the 
scheduled execution of twotime killer bobby lewis shaw a few 
hours after the u s supreme court declined to intervene in the 
case 
shaw had been scheduled to die by injection at 1201 am 
wednesday at potosi correctional center 
however us district judge edward l filippine issued a stay 
at the request of shaws lawyer don wolff the judge said wolffs 
petition contained 12 grounds for relief and that he needed time to 
review the issues 
given the unique circumstances surrounding the filing of this 
petition the nature of the issues raised and the volume of the 
material that must be reviewed a stay of execution is necessary 
he said 
the nations highest court earlier voted 54 against stopping 
the execution 
on tuesday afternoon the missouri coalition against the death 
penalty asked gov john ashcroft to give shaw a reprieve because 
the prisoner does not comprehend the charges against him said 
the groups spokeswoman martha schieber 
its in the interest of the common good that no death penalty 
be imposed on a person that suffers from a mental disease or 
defect ms schieber said there is evidence that mr shaw 
suffers from a mental disease or defect 
ashcrofts spokesman bob ferguson said his boss referred the 
application for a reprieve to the state parole board ashcroft 
supports capital punishment and has not previously stopped an 
execution 
wolff said a psychiatrist and a psychologist who examined shaw 
at the potosi correctional center on monday agreed that the 
38yearold st louis man suffers from mental disease or 
defect they found shaw suffers from dementia memory loss and 
doesnt understand the penalty he faces or the arguments in his 
case the attorney said 
wolff had prepared briefs for state and federal courts 
incorporating the psychological findings and other arguments 
i am so busy i havent had time to be optimistic or 
pessimistic wolff said 
shaw would have been the 124th person executed since the 1976 
us supreme court ruling allowing states to resume carrying out 
the death penalty 
missouri has executed two people since that ruling sixtynine 
other men and two women are under death sentence in missouri 
elsewhere an execution in florida scheduled for wednesday was 
delayed for a man convicted of the 1976 slaying of a florida 
highway patrol trooper and a canadian constable us district 
judge lenore nesbitt on tuesday issued a 48hour stay for jessie 
joseph tafero 43 the governors office immediately rescheduled 
the execution for 701 am friday 
shaw had no visitors scheduled tuesday and he had not asked for 
any family or friends to serve as witnesses to the execution 
prison spokesman dale riley said 
he is very quiet almost what i would call a flat 
personality riley said he hasnt made any real expressions at 
all no statements for public release 
lawyers have argued that shaw has an iq of 73 and has spent most 
of his adult life behind bars he has a history of borderline 
intellectual functioning wolff said 
but courts ruled shaw was fit to stand trial for the july 16 
1979 stabbing death of walter farrow 61 a guard at the missouri 
state penitentiary in jefferson city during the attack on farrow 
with two butcher knives shaw injured a second prison employee 
he was already serving a life sentence for the 1975 murder of a 
man who had been his sisters boyfriend

customs agents investigating the development of a 
suspected super gun for iraq made further arrests tuesday 
british customs officials said 
two british companies involved in the investigation sheffield 
forgemasters ltd and walter somers ltd both confirmed that 
employes had been picked up for questioning 
the questioning and arrests sparked an outcry in the house of 
commons by lawmakers from all parties and there were several calls 
for prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government to 
make a statement 
a customs office spokesman who spoke on condition he was not 
identified said the arrests took place in northern england but 
refused to identify those arrested or to say how many people were 
detained government sources said four people were arrested 
in the house of commons opposition labor party lawmaker richard 
caborn said he understood 14 people from forgemasters and walter 
somers were taken in for questioning three were arrested and six 
other forgemasters executives were in police stations giving 
statements 
conservative lawmaker sir hal miller said he had been told that 
peter mitchell managing director of walter somers had been 
arrested and initially denied access to a lawyer until his wife 
intervened i should like a government minister to make a 
statement on how this comes to pass he said 
eight giant tubes manufactured by sheffield forgemasters were 
seized by british customs officers on april 12 at the port of 
middlesbrough and military experts later said they could be used as 
the barrel of a giant gun 
the iraqi government and the company have said they were 
intended for a petrochemical plant the company has said it had 
government permission to sell the pipes to iraq 
trucks heading for iraq with steel forgings from walter somers 
were stopped in turkey and greece late last month and greek 
authorities arrested the british driver 
caborn said the contracts they were being questioned about 
were cleared by the department of trade and industry and 
demanded the government answer a series of questions about the 
affair 
miller said he had evidence supporting both firms claims of 
being innocent in the affair 
a week before the april 12 seizure of the steel tubes iraq 
placed an urgent order with walter somers for a component that the 
company fears may have been an aiming device the order was refused 
britain imposed an arms embargo on iran and iraq during their 
eightyear war and has not lifted it because no formal ceasefire 
has been signed 
customs officers have said the tubes built by sheffield 
forgemasters could be assembled to make a 131foot long gun barrel 
with a 39inch bore 
the company has said that 44 sections of tubing have already 
been delivered to iraq and there has been speculation that an even 
longer barrel may have been intended

current law aimed at protecting endangered sea 
turtles could cause widespread embargoes of imported shrimp next 
year a bush administration official told congress tuesday 
the law approved last year forbidding shrimp imports after 1991 
from countries that are lax about turtle protection may be 
unrealistic said edward e wolfe deputy assistant secretary of 
state for oceans and fisheries affairs 
there is little chance that these countries will be able to 
meet the standards required by the law in the time allowed no 
matter how genuine the effort said wolfe in testimony before the 
subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the 
environment of the house committee on merchant marine and fisheries 
wolfe told the panel widespread embargoes may be inevitable 
without an extension of the may 1 1991 deadline requiring foreign 
countries to be as tough on shrimpers as the united states 
panama honduras guatemala and costa rica are sure to be 
affected by such an embargo wolfe said 
it has long been the bipartisan policy of the united states 
to support efforts aimed at promoting economic development and 
political stability in central america he said 
now when the region will be looking more than ever to the 
united states to support its democratic efforts we are preparing 
to impose trade sanctions totaling more than 115 million for these 
four countries alone 
mexico brazil and venezuela likely would be hit by an embargo 
also wolfe said 
but shrimpers support such action against countries that do not 
have strict conservation laws said harris lasseigne president of 
the texas shrimp association 
imported shrimp worth 17 billion accounted for more than 75 
percent of all shrimp consumed in the united states in 1988 wolfe 
said the largest suppliers are mexico china and ecuador 
lasseigne said imported shrimp are a severe problem for us 
shrimpers 
dumping of foreign shrimp into the us market directly 
affects the price the american producer receives for his product 
lasseigne said the us producer is forced to compete with much 
lower operating costs in foreign countries 
lasseigne and other shrimpers called for a loosening in 
regulations that require the use of turtle excluder devices in 
their nets which they say cause them to lose up to 70 percent of 
their catch 
last year the enforcement of regulations requiring those 
devices prompted shrimpers to blockade ports in texas and other 
states

president bush sent congress legislation 
tuesday to overhaul the federal civil service pay system 
if enacted the bush initiative would scrap the current 
general schedule of pay scales and erect a new twotier pay 
system for professional and clerical jobs 
it would install a new higher pay scale for the professionals 
and others in hardtofill administrative posts and allow the 
government to vary pay for clerical jobs by the prevailing wages in 
different regions 
it would eliminate automatic step increases for the 
professionals and top administrators substituting instead pay 
increases on merit 
the office of personnel management planned to release full 
details of the pay plan at a news briefing wednesday 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said in a written 
statement the proposal will provide several interim measures to 
address the most serious recruitment and retention problems and 
then over the next several years will initiate broader reforms of 
the paysetting machinery 
fitzwater said these changes will help make the system more 
flexible in responding to the labor market and will strengthen the 
ties between pay and performance

president carlos menem of the 
peronist party which for decades advocated a blend of capitalism 
and socialism said tuesday that capitalism is the only solution to 
argentinas economic problems 
his comments came as 40000 may day demonstrators rallied and 
cheers leftist leaders who denounced menems recent bills to 
restrict the right to strike and to regulate employment 
in opening a session of congress menem said we hope to 
construct capitalism that is humanized decent efficient 
competitive 
menems open support of capitalism was his clearest break with 
his partys traditional support of state control of industry 
he argues he has no choice argentina is beset by triple digit 
inflation and more than 30 percent unemployment the national 
currency the austral has lost nearly all of its value against the 
dollar in recent months and foreign aid was unobtainable 
menem 59 was elected in may 1988 promising pay raises for 
workers and a productive revolution that would spur employment 
and economic growth 
but since taking office in july menem has presided over budget 
cuts layoffs the lifting of controls on prices and foreign 
exchange the partial deregulation of the oil industry and the 
pending sale of state companies 
let no one be mistaken menem told the senators and deputies 
gathered under the immense stainedglass dome of the congress 
the transformation of the state the sale of public companies 
the elimination of regulations and the cleaning up of fiscal 
accounts are necessary to recover the sovereignty of our 
state 
applause was modest 
menems proposals are radical in a nation where onequarter of 
all workers are public employees historically wages and prices 
were controlled imports restricted foreign investment discouraged 
and domestic investment subsidized tax evasion was widespread 
virtually every government since that of party founder juan 
peron in the 1946 had supported government regulations and control 
of industries peron nationalized major industries and created 
state enterprises but also permitted private businesess to operate 
since the 1940s argentina has fallen from being one of the 
worlds richest nations to an economic nightmare

party and other leftist groups rallied to celebrate labor day a

officials expressed concern tuesday over 
israels growing friction with the united states which stems from 
disagreements over middle east peace policy jewish settlements in 
the occupied lands and us hostages in lebanon 
referring to the state departments sharp criticism of israel 
for rejecting us proposals for a palestinianisraeli dialogue 
foreign minister moshe arens said it has to worry me and it has 
to worry all of us 
on monday the state department accused rightwing prime 
minister yitzhak shamir of missing an important opportunity for 
peace by refusing to agree to us terms for talks with 
palestinians in cairo 
the shamir government rejected the talks saying they could lead 
to backdoor negotiations with the palestine liberation organization 
adding to the strain is washingtons pressure on israel to stop 
building jewish settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip and to free shiite moslem prisoners to help win the release 
of us hostages in lebanon 
israel has resisted both demands and shamirs caretaker 
government has even stepped up settlement construction in recent 
weeks 
the haaretz daily reported tuesday that shamir agreed to push 
plans to create settlements approved by previous governments and 
listed 14 sites under consideration the us has repeatedly said 
that settlements are an obstacle to peace 
president bush made an indirect appeal for a prisoner release 
saying he certainly had no objection if israel made such a move 
as a goodwill gesture 
but shamir spokesman avi pazner said israel had not received any 
request for a prisoner release and said the united states was 
certainly not pressuring israel over the issue 
he stressed that israel was seeking the release of three israeli 
servicemen held by radical shiite moslems in lebanon 
but pazner and other officials gave no indication that israel 
would free abducted proiranian shiite cleric sheik abdulkarim 
obeid or about 300 arabs most lebanese shiites held by an 
israelibacked militia in south lebanon to encourage the release of 
us hostages 
shamir is now trying to form a rightwing coalition government 
without the centerleft labor party labor collapsed the joint 
laborlikud government in march when shamir refused to endorse us 
peace proposals 
arens a close shamir ally said tuesday that shamir would stick 
to a peace initiative adopted by the likudlabor coalition in may 
1988 
you will find that in the policy guidelines of the new 
government it will be written that we have to advance the peace 
program of may 1988 and it will be advanced arens said in an 
interview with israel television 
the government peace program calls for palestinian elections and 
limited autonomy in the occupied territories

the united states will suffer a sharp loss of 
influence in europe if it withdraws its troops from the continent 
west german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg said tuesday night 
nuclear forces of the north atlantic treaty organization should 
remain in germany and elsewhere in europe but that their numbers 
should be greatly reduced he said 
all nuclear weapons in west germany belong to and are controlled 
by the united states though france and britain have nucleararmed 
forces elsewhere 
nato officials might move toward replacing groundbased nuclear 
weapons with airlaunched missiles when they meet next week in 
canada he said in a speech to the american institute for 
contemporary german studies of the johns hopkins university 
stoltenberg rejected soviet opposition to a unified germany 
remaining in nato and said he saw hope that the soviet union would 
agree to it 
he said it was conceivable for nato troops to be restricted to 
what is now west germany after unification and that other german 
forces not assigned to nato could then be present in what is now in 
east germany 
it gives me great satisfaction to add that the foreign 
ministers of czechoslovakia poland and hungary supported this 
position at the latest meeting of the warsaw pact foreign 
ministers stoltenberg said their support might help persuade 
moscow to accept german membership in nato he added 
stoltenberg said the united states might be able to reduce its 
forces on the central european front beyond the 195000 troops 
proposed by president bush but americans should maintain a 
substantial military presence in europe he said 
in the past american cooperation and influence on european 
policy was helpful and in future american policy and influence in 
europe can be helpful stoltenberg said 
but without any soldiers or significant numbers of soldiers 
your influence in all matters of security policy will sharply 
decline he added and i doubt whether this is desirable 
stoltenberg laughed at a suggestion that the american dominance 
of the security structure of nato was an infringement on german 
sovereignty and thus was comforting to france 
to avoid war between germany and france we dont need nato 
he said

the ruling democratic party has 
asked the government to tolerate the establishment of opposition 
parties a statement read on national television monday night said 
the former french colony has been ruled since independence in 
1960 by the democratic party the nations constitution permits 
opposition parties but opposition groups have always had their 
requests to form political parties rejected on technical grounds 
and their leaders have been harassed 
the statement said the country had remained a oneparty state 
because the people preferred such a system but the communique 
added that the government was invited to authorize the formation 
of new political parties 
today the national consensus on which the democratic partys 
leadership had been built seems broken since some of our 
compatriots have demonstrated to show their desire to create their 
own parties the statement said 
the government usually approves party decisions 
last week the government indicated opposition parties would be 
tolerated when it said anything is possible as long as order 
is maintained several opposition groups have already applied to 
form political parties 
the government has been under growing pressure to accept 
opposition parties since mass student demonstrations in march 
protesting austerity measures and following democratic reforms by 
several other west african and central african nations 
the march riots forced the closing of the nations schools for 
the rest of the year and led to calls for the resignation of 
president felix houphouetboigny 
the traditional may day parade was also canceled tuesday because 
of the march demonstrations said the government newspaper

the battle monday came during what the chadian embassy to france 
described as moppingup operations against the islamic legion 
rebels opposed to the chadian government 
a communique released by the embassy made no mention of 
government losses it claimed that the government troops captured 
several pickup trucks equipped with rocket launchers 
the statement did not say where the fighting took place 
the rebels launch attacks into its territory from bases in the 
sparsely populated darfur province of western sudan where the 
khartoum government exercises virtually no control 
chad claims the islamic legion is armed and trained by libya 
tripoli denies the force exists and terms the conflict a purely 
chadian affair 
in a statement from the official libyan news agency jana libya 
accused chad of hostility and said president hissene habre 
hopes to distract attention from a failing economy by stirring up 
war hysteria 
libya has no connection with the armed confrontation between 
chadians and we have no intention of aggression said the jana 
communique monitored in rome we are still hoping for dialogue 
and depending on it 
the latest round of battles in the sporadic civil war was 
touched off in march when rebels seized two border posts 
france the former colonial power added a company of 
paratroopers an extra transport plane and a medical unit to its 
military contingent after the takeover 
chadian foreign minister ibn oumar said in paris last week that 
attempts to negotiate its longstanding territorial dispute with 
libya over the mineralrich aouzou strip have failed 
the two countries agreed last year to confirm a ceasefire they 
also agreed to exchange prisoners of war and submit the territorial 
dispute to international arbitration

prelude to a kiss the bewitching fantasy by 
craig lucas has made the journey from offbroadway to broadway 
with most of the magic intact 
the big question for the play which opened tuesday at the helen 
hayes theater was what would happen to it once leading man alec 
baldwin left to do a movie and was replaced by timothy hutton 
well the verdict is not yet in on hutton he undoubtedly will 
get better in the role but right now the actor is giving a tense 
and tentative performance concentrating more on his lines than on 
his character once hutton relaxes he should do fine he has a 
boyish bewilderment that seems exactly right considering the odd 
but sweet plot 
the play itself is just as charming as ever and the rest of the 
original cast is even more accomplished than when prelude to a 
kiss first opened in march at offbroadways circle rep 
the story is a modern new york romance boymeetsgirl 
boylosesgirl and then boyfindsgirl in the strangest of 
circumstances it starts as a romantic comedy with peter played by 
hutton meeting rita marylouise parker at a party they fall in 
love visit her parents in new jersey and then get married 
the play builds to the wedding scene where the bride is kissed 
by a mysterious old man played by barnard hughes suddenly they 
have exchanged souls much of the evenings pleasure comes from the 
realization that hughes in a funny touching performance is now 
the young woman and parker the elderly gent and lucas dialogue 
is unerring perfectly capturing the cosmic transfer of these two 
very different personalities 
but there is a darkness around the edges of this fairy tale 
lucas also deals with the transitory nature of life and love 
especially as peter begins to realize the girl he has married is 
not the woman he thought she was it makes him wonder just what 
love is merely a physical attraction or something more 
parker is especially endearing particularly in the early scenes 
when she displays a goofy offcenter sense of comedy larry 
bryggman and debra monk excel as her understandably worried 
parents and there is an expert comic cameo by john dossett as the 
young mans sardonic best friend 
director norman rene a longtime lucas collaborator handles 
the play with a light playful touch that never turns preachy even 
in its more serious moments prelude to a kiss celebrates the 
unexpected nature of romance its that sense of adventure that 
makes the play such a delight

soviet ambassador alexander zotov said 
tuesday the arabisraeli conflict and the buildup of weapons in the 
middle east would be a top priority issue at the may 30 to june 
3 superpower summit 
he told reporters the situation in the middle east is 
dramatic there are many weapons stockpiles of the most destructive 
kind and much violence too and something must be done about it 
speaking at a news conference two days after president hafez 
assad returned from talks in moscow with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev zotov reiterated moscows support for syria 
the threat by iraq another soviet friend to use chemical 
weapons against israel in the event of an israeli nuclear attack 
has added to tension in a region already bristling with advanced 
weapons 
zotov said washington and moscow have conducted very 
constructive contacts on the subject of peace in the middle east 
prior to the coming talks between president bush and gorbachev he 
did not elaborate 
but he said peace in the region was being held back by israeli 
reservations to entering into a peace process and complained 
the united states has not shown enough firmness with the 
israelis to push matters forward 
zotov stressed moscows continuing commitment to bolster syrias 
armed forces but added 
it is the general policy of the soviet union to reduce the 
level of military conflict everywhere including the middle east 
and the emphasis is on a reasonable defensive capability 
assad says middle east peace is impossible unless syria achieves 
strategic parity with israel 
assad concluded an agreement in moscow for continuing soviet 
military aid no details have been divulged 
western reports say moscow has been stressing to assad that he 
abandon his drive for stategic parity with israel and has reduced 
the volume of advanced weapons it traditionally supplied damascus 
the londonbased flight international magazine reported last 
month that the kremlin turned down a syrian request for sa10 and 
sa11 antiaircraft missiles zotov did not deny this report or 
similar ones but again stressed moscows continuing commitment to 
syrias security 
analysts estimate that syria owes the soviet union 15 billion 
soviet officials in damascus have said the debt is only 4 billion

two men who say they helped soviet master spy 
george blake break prison in 1966 won a high court order tuesday to 
delay their trial 
lawyers later said they could not recall any recent similar 
exercise of the high courts powers to suspend a criminal trial 
judge sir derek hodgson ordered the trial of patrick pottle and 
michael randle halted while their application proceeds for a 
judicial review the trial was to have started at the old bailey 
central criminal court wednesday 
his ruling overturned judge sir william macphersons decision 
friday at the old bailey against granting a permanent suspension of 
the trial 
pottle 52 an antiques dealer and randle 56 a researcher 
said it would be oppressive and an abuse of the process of 
the court to prosecute them for something that happened 24 years 
ago 
their plea raised an important legal issue as to whether 
decisions of crown court judges in such circumstances are open to 
judicial review 
hodgson said their plea should be considered quickly by the high 
courts divisional court the hearing will be on may 16 
blake now 67 and living in moscow was a double agent jailed 
for 42 years in 1961 he admitted spying for the soviets while 
working for british intelligence 
blake escaped from londons wormwood scrubs prison in 1966 
pacifists pottle and randle said in their 1989 book the blake 
escape that they helped him because of the cruel and inhuman 
sentence they say authorities knew of their involvement by 1970 
but prosecution began only when their book appeared 
pottle and randle are charged with aiding and abetting blakes 
escape which carries a sentence of up to five years in prison and 
with two conspiracy charges with a maximum sentence of two years 
or an unlimited fine 
pottle and randle said tuesday they were pleased with hodgsons 
ruling and wanted the case settled 
we dont want it hanging around any longer it is a bit of a 
strain randle said

the general assembly on tuesday adopted a 
declaration calling on industrialized nations to devote 07 percent 
of their gross national product to the development of third world 
nations 
the 106nation assembly adopted the declaration by concensus to 
avoid an open split between western and developing nations 
the united states opposes the idea of setting targets for the 
amount of aid contributed and it is was unclear whether many 
industrialized nations would abide by the nonbinding declaration 
the declaration is expected to provide general guidelines to 
helping underdeveloped nations 
i am grateful for the spirit of harmony and compromise which 
made it possible to reach agreement assembly president joseph 
garba of nigeria said in a statement 
bolivian ambassador hugo navajasmogro speaking for developing 
nations called the declaration and session landmarks in a new 
chapter in the economic history of the united nations 
this is a message of hope and opportunity for the poorest 
sectors of the world the developing countries for twothirds of 
mankind 
us envoy edward marks senior adviser to the economic session 
told the assembly this declaration represents an important new 
step in the way we all look at economic development 
but he also said the united states opposes the idea of aid 
targets believing that each state should be responsible for their 
own development 
the international economic environment while important plays 
a supporting role marks said 
one us diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
we feel we should not be forced to give relief we wish to keep 
flexibility in giving debt relief within our broader government 
interests 
a large proportion of international aid goes toward servicing 
developing nations foreign debt 
the document calls on industrialized nations to devote 07 
percent of their gross national product to aiding underdeverloped 
countries and 015 percent to the least developed countries 
developed countries should enhance the quantity and quality of 
their aid the document says 
us officials have said that foreign aid is given to further 
national policy and insists that the multilateral lending 
institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary 
fund bear the primary responsibility for aid to the third world aid 
the united states has also demanded economic reforms in the 
third world so development aid is not wasted 
the document says aid to eastern european nations should not 
come at the expense of help to developing nations 
the most important challenge for the 1990s the declaration 
says is the revitalization of economic growth and social 
development in the develoment countries which calls for sustained 
growth of the world economy and favorable external conditions

in a rare revision of mormon ritual the 
church has dropped wording that required women to pledge to obey 
their husbands and portrayed the clergy of other religions as 
agents of satan 
women must now vow to obey god rather than their husbands in the 
endowment ceremony a ritual the church teaches is necessary to 
enable members to live with god after death the ceremony is 
performed only once for each person but a member may go through it 
countless times as a proxy for those who have died 
the revised ritual which took effect last month in ceremonies 
performed in the 43 temples of the church of jesus christ of 
latterday saints is being greeted with enthusiasm by church 
members who say it reflects greater sensitivity toward women and 
other religions 
the temple is an important part of my spiritual life and the 
changes have allowed me to go to the temple with renewed joy

andy gustafson wears two wedding rings 
one from his new marriage one from the marriage that ended in 
murder 
two and a half years ago gustafson 36 a smalltown lawyer 
returned home and found his wife raped and shot to death and his 
two children drowned in separate bathtubs 
a 17yearold neighborhood youth was arrested two days later and 
eventually sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 
murders the teen had apparently been in the house when mrs 
gustafson and her son returned home the daughter was killed when 
she came home later 
i was too afraid of going to look for my children because i 
was afraid id find them dead gustafson said of that day it 
was so shocking and unbelievable i screamed i wailed 
except for his moving eulogy at his familys funeral and his 
oneday testimony at the murder trial gustafson has remained out 
of the public eye 
he has not remained a victim 
on jan 1 1989 a date chosen to signify a new beginning 
gustafson remarried he has known his second wife carol 42 since 
they were married to others and both couples attended the townsend 
congregational church her husband died of a brain tumor in 1984 
after 15 years of marriage 
it certainly would have been much more difficult without 
her he said sitting in his booklined study i dont know 
whether i would have made it or not without her now i have a 
reason to get up in the morning something to live for 
rather than erase the past they make a point to remember both 
wear two wedding bands their new ones on their left ring fingers 
and the others from their first marriages on their right hands 
at their wedding carols first husbands father gave her away 
andys dead wifes brother sang carols matron of honor was her 
former sisterinlaw they had two ministers with ties to both of 
their first spouses 
your life is about your relationships when you lose them you 
lose your life in a way andy said you either get stuck or you 
go on and make a new life 
they both considered whether they were getting married too soon 
there were a few people in this town that were just aghast 
said carol a warm petite brunette but when youve gone through 
this kind of loss youre just glad the sun is shining every day 
life becomes more precious to you we didnt want to waste it 
the couple live in carols 10room yellow clapboard colonial on 
the townsend common the center of a picturebook new england town 
about 45 miles northwest of boston near the new hampshire state 
line 
the house is three doors from the church where the funeral was 
held for the gustafson family and where he married carol and just 
a few hundred yards from hillside cemetery where his family is 
buried 
andy has resumed his law practice just across the common 
starting over has not been easy 
his life was shattered in the late afternoon of dec 1 1987 he 
had just closed a big real estate deal and phoned his wife 
priscilla 33 to see if she could get a baby sitter so they could 
go out to dinner and celebrate 
when no one answered the phone andy drove the mile to his 
familys rustic house set on an isolated knoll in the woods he 
saw priscillas car in the driveway but the house was eerily dark 
he found his wife who was several months pregnant dead in 
their bedroom she had been sexually assaulted and shot twice in 
the head 
he doesnt remember everything that happened after that the 
trauma was such that he couldnt sleep through the night for six 
months 
he remembers going into the kitchen to call the police and his 
parents too afraid to look for his children because he feared he 
would find them dead 
when the police arrived andy sat in one of their cruisers an 
officer came out and told him his daughter abigail 7 and son 
william 5 had been drowned 
you lose total track of time he said the shock gives you 
the adrenaline to get through it at first but then it wears off 
after the murders andy stayed with his parents then rented an 
apartment in townsend but within a few months he moved back to his 
familys home 
i had to emotionally reclaim it he said i had to go back 
in there and be all right the house became a source of strength 
for me with the memories of my family the love that occurred 
there was much stronger than the death there 
the first months were difficult despite dinner invitations from 
friends who made sure he would not be alone andy said he joined a 
support group for the survivors of homicide victims 
its a roller coaster with no highs just different depths 
he said its a struggle just to get through each day 
first you sob all the time then you set goals like you say 
today im going to go shopping you dont want to go out and 
deal with people but then you go ahead and feel better because you 
did it 
self pity was not his strong suit 
you always think why me but you realize soon enough why 
not me if you live with your eyes open you know life isnt 
fair 
he gravitated to carol who understood better than most in their 
circle of friends from church what it meant to lose someone 
from the start they both said theyve talked out their mutual 
grief andy in particular still has his bad days

after 500 years of being roman 
catholic in public and keeping their jewish traditions alive in 
private the jews of belmonte are cautiously leaving their 
selfmade ghetto of secrecy 
the community of about 300 in this hilltop village in the heart 
of portugal dates from the late 15th century 
it was then that thousands of sephardic jews chose conversion to 
catholicism as an alternative to expulsion torture or death at the 
hands of the inquisition 
the jews became known as marranos a word believed to derive 
from the old spanish for pig and still an insult in the belmonte 
community and defied their roman catholic persecutors by 
practicing their religion clandestinely 
portuguese monarchs eager for tax revenue and jewish talent 
had protected the thriving sephardic community in their own country 
and offered shelter to jews persecuted in neighboring spain 
sepharad is the hebrew name for the area now comprising spain and 
portugal 
after 1496 however king manuel i forced about 80000 jews to 
convert to catholicism in order to seal a royal alliance with 
spains powerful rulers ferdinand and isabella four years 
earlier isabella had signed an edict expelling from spain all jews 
who refused to convert 
manuels successor john iii decided to hunt out heretics and 
hidden jews portuguese inquisitors ordered the first burning of a 
heretic in 1543 and the last occurred in 1765 
even 169 years after portugal formally abolished the 
inquisition belmontes jews find it hard to be open about their 
religion 
they still attend mass with their catholic neighbors at the 
village church where for so many generations they have been 
baptized married and buried under marble tombstones 
theyve lived on the outside like christians on the 
inside in their houses they were not christians they were jews 
and they have transmitted this from father to son said colette 
avital israels ambassador to portugal 
jewish leaders still hesitate to tell outsiders their story 
licinda melo a village official said jewish community 
leaders have asked me to tell tourists even tourists from israel 
that there are no more jews living here that its just a legend 
the reluctance is reflected in suspicions that remain between 
jews and the 3000 or so catholics in belmonte the village is in 
one of europes poorest regions the mountains of lower beira 
province and many families live on the equivalent of less than 
200 a month 
antonieta garcia who has worked with belmontes jews for 20 
years and is married to the mayor said other villagers resent the 
relative wealth of some jewish families 
most jews are tradesmen at the regions bustling country fairs 
and markets and some own textile factories belmontes economic 
mainstay 
tumbledown drywall stone houses that once formed the villages 
jewish ghetto now are occupied by employees of the factories most 
of whom are catholics 
illiteracy and superstition common in the region contribute to 
tensions between catholics and jews 
an elderly villager who would not give her name said she often 
had seen jews dressed in white dancing by the river under a full 
moon 
i dont know what theyre afraid of what theyre ashamed 
of she said we roman catholics are not ashamed of our 
religion 
sammuel swartz a polish jew working in the area as a mining 
engineer discovered the belmonte community in 1917 and wrote 
they were completely ignorant of the existance of other jews with 
different religious rites to the new christians 
the old women who acted as keepers of the faith did not 
recognize swartzs hebrew prayers and rejected him 
today confidence is slowly growing and leaders of the community 
are beginning contacts with other jews 
in 1988 president mario soares met jews in an old ghetto in 
nearby castelo de vide and formally apologized for the inquisition 
after centuries of clandestine meetings in attics and darkened 
rooms belmonte jews now gather to pray in a small twostory house 
off the main square 
elias nunes elected president of the jewish community says 
plans exist to build a synagogue with financial support from jews 
in europe israel and the united states 
he hopes the synagogue and a cultural center will be built 
beside an olive grove the probable site of a jewish temple in the 
12th century 
belmontes jews are accustomed to their own version of judaism 
and may have difficulty adapting to a more orthodox religion 
they had no rabbis or books and their jewish traditions rituals 
and prayers have been passed on by women through generations 
taking on many aspects of the catholic surroundings 
jewish prayers and religious services in belmonte are led by 
women in portuguese 
as the sabbath begins at dusk on friday small oil lamps the 
lords lamps flicker in jewish homes instead of the more 
traditional white candles 
the jewish festivals of pesach and yom kippur are kept but on 
days differernt from those in the jewish calendar pesach has been 
renamed pascoa portuguese for easter 
during pesach the jews beat the waters of the zezere river with 
olive branches to symbolize the parting of the red sea and the 
exodus from egypt 
they also celebrate the christian festival of ascension as one 
of their holiest days when the community gathers to sing and dance 
in the open air 
late in december they have a festival called natalinho little 
christmas 
younger jews are more open in supporting a return to orthodoxy 
some young men have been circumcised the men are taking over 
dominant roles in religious services and a there is stricter 
adherence to the sabbath ban on work 
whats needed is a cemetery for jews said moises abrantes 
looking up at the granite crucifix above the church he frowned 
im in my 80s he said ive not got much time left and i 
dont want anybody putting any cross over me after ive gone

dr douglas ratner believed so strongly that 
health care costs neednt rise in perpetuity that he set out to 
prove it his program has improved health bolstered morale and 
yes cut costs 
people respond to incentives to personal responsibility he 
says lamenting the scarcity of such elements in most group health 
insurance plans his wealth from health organization includes these 
and more 
it is longrange costeffective healthenhancing the benefits 
of good health seem capable of making a big longterm dent in 
costs but it has immediate benefits too for the individual 
employer insurer country 
simplified it awards favorable health behavior or practice with 
credits or points applied to a wealth from health account which 
the individual can use in many ways such as to lower deductible 
insurance payments 
points are awarded in various categories in the wealth from the 
heart category for instance an employee might earn points for 
losing weight lowering blood pressure or cholesterol and improving 
aerobic fitness 
the point system may be as varied as desired wealth from 
knowledge wealth from a healthy family wealth from practicing 
safety first wealth for following doctors orders generally 
simple tests confirm improvements 
the individuals approach to work and lifestyle must change 
says ratner workers must accept responsibility for affecting 
change rather than relying on some other party lifestyle he 
declares is the basic costdeterminant 
ratner 37 tested his program in april 1988 implementing it in 
conjunction with the mount vernon hospital a suburban 
notforprofit facility where he is associate director of the 
internal medicine residency program 
calling it the health responsibility program he offered it to 
the hospitals nonunion fulltime employees on a voluntary basis 
with each garnered point equaling 1 
seventythree percent of those eligible or 163 participants 
enrolled the results said the doctor exceeded our wildest 
expectations 
fortyeight percent initially were overweight but more than 
half had lost an average 73 pounds by the oneyear check point 
sixtyone percent of those initially found hypertensive had 
normalized their blood pressure through diet or medicine at the 
threemonth check point 
fifteen percent of those who smoked quit during the two months 
between the programs orientation and its inception and 26 percent 
of those who still smoked had quit completely at the oneyear mark 
costs were cut the personnel department found that program 
participants lowered their medical claims to 41170 per person in 
1988 from 68606 in 1987 meanwhile nonparticipant costs soared 
to 153284 from 79887 
those figures it should be noted do not include savings that 
might be attributed to decreased absenteeism increased 
productivity or lessened pressure on the future cost structure by 
fewer claims 
based on our breakthrough experience here at the mount vernon 
hospital the time is now for bold innovative measures says 
ratner who feels he has demonstrated several assumptions 
especially the lifestyle factor in costs 
and more that employees will adapt to the system because it is 
fair and it works because it involves personal responsibility is 
incentive based goal oriented and intuitively as well as 
historically sound 
after viewing the results ratner himself took the bold measures 
he called for structuring the health responsibility program and 
its unique point system into a package that can be utilized in any 
companys flexible benefits system 
working with robert thurston of the human resource consulting 
group a salt lake city marketing operation points from ratners 
program can be committed in myriad ways to customized health 
benefit packages offered by employers 
what will the points buy you name it good health to be sure 
but dollars too or more vacation time or lower insurance 
deductibles for example in fact a catalog of possibilities 
already has been developed 
ratner father of two sees the incentives as a way to promote 
not just worker health but that of entire families since family 
members often affect health insurance costs as much or more than 
workers themselves 
americas job he says is to refocus the entire american 
psyche to become aggressive against the enemy of rising costs 
and to beat them he wonders he says how we have remained so 
passive in view of the threat

in an upcoming true life cable movie 
about the watts riots as experienced by the los angeles times 
first black reporter heres what you wont see 
the firing of reporter trainee robert richardson the same 
month the times won a pulitzer prize for its coverage of the riots 
richardsons battle with alcoholism and arrest on a theft 
charge and the tragedy and turmoil that followed the inexperienced 
journalists brief tenure at the times 
debates over the accuracy of docudramas have created as much 
controversy as the events they recreate 
a 1987 madefortv nbc movie about the billionaire boys club 
prompted an outcry from defense attorneys who claimed it 
jeopardized bbc leader joe hunts right to a fair trial hunt was 
convicted of murdering a con man who threatened the getrichquick 
scheme hunt hatched with some ivy league pals 
a 1985 dramatization of the atlanta child murders started an 
uproar over its sympathetic portrayal of wayne williams who still 
was appealing his 1982 conviction when cbs broadcast the show 
blending truth and fiction for the sake of compelling television 
is a little like playing god truth is what the producer and 
screenwriter say it is 
in heat wave now in production for ted turners tnt cable 
network here is the truth you will see 
blair underwood of la law playing richardson a 
24yearold black messenger in the classified advertising 
department who is promoted to the newsroom after phoning in the 
looting and burning that leveled watts in august 1965 
the inability of the allwhite times news staff to get inside 
until richardson who lived in the area volunteered his help it 
was richardson who told times readers that rampaging youths were 
screaming burn baby burn 
a postscript to the movie that says the times went on to win a 
pulitzer for its watts coverage and richardson went on to become 
the papers first black reporter 
but richardson did not ride off into a journalistic sunset in 
may 1966 nine months after his promotion and in the same month the 
times was awarded its pulitzer richardson was fired 
heat wave screenwriter michael lazarou said that detail and 
richardsons subsequent troubles are irrelevant to the script 
we are talking about an extraordinary set of circumstances in 
which the los angeles times was hamstrung lazarou said what 
happened to bob richardson later doesnt matter what is important 
is that the lessons of the watts riots went largely unlearned that 
is whats relevant 
although richardson is the lead character and was paid a fee for 
his story rights heat wave to be televised in august is 
really about watts lazarou said 
pressed about richardson lazarou refused further interviews in 
two memos he refused to answer more questions about the script or 
richardson who he said is now a close friend 
in one memo lazarou wrote though alcoholism played a role in 
a misdeameanor conviction later dropped which ended his career at 
the times richardson went on to work for local radio stations 
lazarou continued as bob will openly admit his life has 
certainly had its highs and lows but his courage and his 
contribution to the los angeles times during its hour of need 
cannot and should not be minimized 
richardson could not be located for an interview hes not 
available right now said turner spokeswoman alison hill he is 
not listed in the los angeles phone book times reporters who 
worked with him during the riots said they have not talked with him 
in 25 years 
it was not working out for him to be a reporter he was let 
go he never functioned as a reporter he did not go out and cover 
the riots he did contribute stuff but it was kind of personal 
reflections said eric malnic a times reporter who helped cover 
the riots 
those reflections included this description i had to do all 
of my telephoning from streetcorner booths in gas stations you 
have no idea how naked you can feel in an exposed lighted 
telephone booth 
but i was hep at that time whenever a group of negroes 
approached to look me over i knew what to do you open the door 
stick your head out and shout burn baby burn then you are 
safe 
lazarous script was approved by the times former times editor 
bill thomas who was city editor during the riots also signed off 
on the script which uses his name 
this stuff is dredging up memories that are really dim 
thomas said he was an inexperienced reporter and there were some 
problems with that but i dont remember too many details 
richardson was seen in march at a skid row residential program 
for alcoholic men said a salvation army employee who wouldnt let 
his name be used i had seen him there about a year before i 
guess he had reentered the program the employee said 
he was such a nice man my impression was that this was 
someone who had had a very interesting journalistic career but had 
had some very bad times

a quartercentury before the lower 
mississippi delta development commission started roaming that 
region to chart solutions for its misery a similar agency had a 
similar mission to ease similar misery 
in 1964 president lyndon b johnson announced a national war 
on poverty from a front porch in inez ky the next year 
congress set up the appalachian regional commission which 
incorporated many of the poverty programs to help appalachia catch 
up with the rest of the nation in jobs health services education 
and transportation 
today improvements have been made but many of the 205 million 
people in the 13 states of appalachia still live in wretchedness 
in homes little more than shanties with no sewer systems and no 
running water 
the creeks around keystone are so dirty and dotted with toilet 
paper that locals have dubbed the result the charmin trail 
richard mullins a 44yearold unemployed miner who receives 
744 a month in government benefits lives with his wife and three 
children under a patchwork roof that leaks into one bedroom when it 
rains the floors are full of holes and sinking the paint is 
peeling and rats run about the house at will 
were still trying to find something better because this house 
is really not worth the 50 we pay a month said mullins wife 
darlene 
the appalachian region encompasses all of west virginia and 
parts of virginia kentucky tennessee north carolina south 
carolina georgia alabama mississippi ohio new york 
pennsylvania and maryland 
monroe newman senior economist for the appalachian commission 
asserts that the region as a whole is vastly better off with 2 
million more jobs than it had 25 years ago mainly in the service 
industries and with improved health care education and highways 
but better off is relative according to the latest data 
available from the appalachian commission based on the 1980 
census 14 percent of the regions people live below the poverty 
level nationally 124 percent of the populace is below that level 
their personal income per capita in 1987 averaged 12453 
compared to 15484 nationally last years average unemployment 
rate ran 59 percent sixtenths higher than the national average 
the poverty has spawned a host of social problems including 
drugs gangs and teenage pregnancies among youth who have little 
to do in some areas for instance it is a 40mile round trip to a 
movie 
the hardest hit towns are in the coaldominated counties of west 
virginia virginia kentucky and southeastern ohio newman said 
more than 100000 jobs have been lost in the appalachian coal 
fields since 1978 in some counties in these states unemployment 
runs more than twice as high as the national average 
they aint enough jobs for nobody said clady johnson of 
trammel va if kids graduate here they got to leave to get a 
job 
she knows firsthand her son gregory 23 enlisted in the army 
when he couldnt find a job mrs johnson who is divorced lives 
on 386 a month in government benefits 
the commission on religion in appalachia says that in spite of 
the obvious effectiveness of antipoverty programs the war was not 
won poverty rates remain unacceptably high and the risk of 
poverty is much greater for some regions and population groups than 
others 
it is bleak said jim sessions executive coordinator of the 
commission a coalition of 17 religious denominations formed to 
fight poverty survival is the name of the game 
sessions said things did improve in the late 1960s and through 
the 1970s with the economy rebounding and the building of 
hospitals clinics community colleges and highways 
but in the recession of the early 1980s he said appalachia 
lost 2 manufacturing jobs for every single job gained in the prior 
decade he especially noted coal jobs lost in west virginia and 
virginia steel jobs in pennsylvania and textile jobs throughout 
the tennessee valley 
in terms of employment and income all the progress we made 
was wiped out in two years at the beginning of the reagan 
administration and weve not regained it yet and probably wont 
sessions said weve moved our industrial base to a service 
resort and recreation economy which at best pays minimum wage

for nearly a decade states in the mississippi delta region have 
pursued tough education reforms and they are starting to get 
results 
last month kentucky gov wallace wilkinson signed legislation 
that will overhaul public education the changes were enacted after 
the state supreme court in june found the public school system 
inequitable and unconstitutional 
spending varied district to district from 1800 to 4200 now 
a state minimum 2900 has been established in addition the new 
kentucky law calls for committees of parents teachers and 
principals to make daytoday school decisions 
in mississippi gov ray mabus also signed legislation in april 
continuing education reforms begun in the early 1980s that have 
raised standardized test scores for the last four years and 
increased accountability by requiring district report cards 
one measure commits 182 million to curriculum improvements in 
the next three years another calls for 800 million in bonds to 
replace aging school buildings and buses mabus has said hell call 
a special legislative session in june to work out how to finance 
the plan 
arkansas education reforms have reduced class sizes added 
support personnel and expanded the curriculum particularly 
language science and math courses 
a 1cent sales tax hike and a teacher testing policy were among 
reforms pushed by gov bill clinton in 1983 
since then his office says 1400 people who failed the teacher 
tests are out of the classroom 17000 more students are taking 
foreignlanguage classes than in 1983 15 percent more students are 
attending college dropout rates have improved and test scores are 
up 
in tennessee a draft of gov ned mcwherters 1991 package 
spells out 12 major goals from requiring kindergarten to better 
preparing college freshmen to do collegelevel work 
the plan also calls for performance audit teams in the state 
education department 
reforms in louisiana have included reducing classroom size 
rewarding successful schools and raising teachers pay though hard 
times in the states petroleum industry have cut revenues one 
effort gov buddy roemer is pushing is a 30 million computerbased 
reading lab 
the states still fall behind much of the nation in perpupil 
spending 
according to the national center for educational statistics in 
washington the national average expenditure was 4243 in 198788 
the last year for which complete figures were available 
the comparable state figures were kentucky 3011 
mississippi 2548 arkansas 2989 tennessee 3068 and 
louisiana 3138

decades of racism economic failure and 
indifference have sapped the mississippi delta region of

the majestic steel bridge tall as an 
office tower and wide as a freeway was supposed to tie the 
lessdeveloped west bank of the mississippi river to the east 
banks world of industrial plants jobs and development 
but no traffic crosses the 81 million structure on the west 
bank below trash is heaped in weedchoked fields and shanties sit 
on squat pillars of red brick near the rivers edge a concrete 
pier a hundred feet tall holds up nothing but the clouds 
the gramercywallace bridge you see never was completed it 
was in the works for nine years but louisiana ran out of money and 
construction was halted in 1987 before access ramps were built 
so it goes in the mississippi delta today the unreachable span 
is a bleak symbol of just how difficult it is to bridge the gap 
between poverty and prosperity 
all we can do is hope and pray that they will finish the 
bridge and things will come better said jessie allen owner of 
allens bridgeview grocery store 
until the bridge is completed probably not until 1994 rusting 
and sometimes unreliable ferries fight the swift river current to 
move a handful of cars and a pittance of commerce across the river 
the nearest bridge is 30 miles upriver 
here as elsewhere up and down the impoverished delta region 
which includes parts of arkansas illinois kentucky louisiana 
mississippi missouri and tennessee the muddy river itself is at 
times a barrier blocking growth 
without good transportation plants have located elsewhere 
without jobs residents rely on food stamps and welfare without 
hope they move away or resign themselves to the heritage of 
poverty 
the mississippi river divides the region instead of unifying 
it said stan hyland a memphis state university anthropologist 
hyland has worked with the lower mississippi river delta 
development commission which has studied the region for 18 months 
its probably a quirk of history hyland said the unique 
history of the region the richness the river has worked against 
it its a great irony 
state and local leaders say reversing the deltas misfortunes 
will take improvement in education economic planning political 
relations among blacks and whites and building bridges and 
highways for development 
lake providence la has no bridge across the river its only 
claim to fame these days is that it has the highest unemployment 
rate about 18 percent in the state with the nations highest 
unemployment rate 
the river is a wall said ed dauphine president of the 
louisiana delta bank in lake providence across the river from 
mississippi 
we are a welfarebased economy and part of that is because i 
dont have any opportunity to sell any product in the state of 
mississippi theres not a nickels worth of commerce were dealing 
with over there 
the irony here as elsewhere in the delta is that the rich 
farmland may hold people back more than it helps them 
locals black and white say the few white families who own the 
land blocked development efforts for fear of raising the cost of 
farm labor high unemployment means an ample supply of cheap hoe 
hands seasonal laborers to chop cotton and tend fields 
its colonial said wilbur hawkins executive director of 
the delta commission the welfare system supports the poor and 
the rich and its going to take everyone working together to 
reverse that 
olly neal led boycotts of whiteowned businesses and established 
a health clinic for the poor in marianna ark in the early 70s 
today conditions are different neal said but not necessarily 
better 
i certainly dont believe that economically africanamericans 
are any better off he said we have no ownership in financial 
institutions for example and unemployment rates are comparable to 
the 70s 
now an attorney neal continues his fight but through the 
political process he was one in a group of blacks that 
successfully sued the state claiming arkansas legislative district 
boundary lines discriminated against blacks 
a federal judge ordered some lines redrawn and neal now 
believes the delta will have more than one black representative in 
the arkansas statehouse 
politics is the only place i think substantial change can come 
here in the delta and that change only comes by africanamericans 
being more insistent he said we have to insist on having an 
adequate share of the political offices 
change though doesnt come easy 
its much too slow for me neal said half the population 
here in the deep delta is africanamerican and almost none of 
the leadership that cuts out half of the ideas half of the 
enthusiasm 
half the population here is a drag on the other half half the 
team is sitting down not by choice but by acquiescence in part 
and by insistence of the white population 
most agree that improvement in the delta will be slow 
the problems of the region didnt get like this overnight and 
we cant fix them overnight either hawkins said we didnt 
plan to fail we failed to plan 
in a report to congress on may 14 the commission will recommend 
developing tourism as a means of economic growth along with 
regional cooperation on marketing delta products it will seek 
greater federal funds to help the poor and programs to help with 
education reform 
education is the key we know it said louisiana gov buddy 
roemer there are 8 million people in the delta and one 
characteristic stands out too many of us are not equipped 
educationally 
annie brown daughter of a sharecropper is already trying to 
make a difference 
in a palegreen classroom that was a sheriffs office six 
adults sing the alphabet to a rap beat before too long youll be 
picking up speed before you know it youll be able to read 
these students some unable to write their names when they 
enrolled are part of a volunteer literacy program in rolling fork 
miss run by mrs brown the program has attracted 242 residents 
in five years and 27 have passed highschool diploma equivalency 
tests 
her effort is being copied in other parts of the delta and 
commission members cite it as an example of the change that must 
come to improve the future 
im saying to the community lets educate our parents 
mother cannot read father cannot read so theres no reinforcement 
for the children mrs brown said in the black community nine 
out of 10 times if you find illiteracy the whole family is 
illiterate 
with little funding and only volunteers to help hers is a 
lonely battle one that typifies how difficult it will be to bring 
about change 
were trying to break the cycle mrs brown said the 
cycle must be opened up

indias version of the fbi already 
swamped by corruption investigations has stretched itself thinner 
by joining the fight against separatist movements 
the central bureau of investigation has been in the news most 
often for probing deals made while prime minister rajiv gandhi was 
in office gandhi lost his job in novembers elections to 
anticorruption candidate vp singh 
now the bureau also is handling routine murder cases in troubled 
jammukashmir state pursuing antiterrorist investigations in 
violent punjab and looking into a tribal revolt in faraway assam 
the man with his finger in the dike is rajendra shekhar 
director general of the bureau a 55yearold career policeman from 
the western desert state of rajasthan 
im losing weight he said in an interview were the 
busiest weve ever been 
shekhar looked worn out these days he drinks jasmine tea with 
lime which is supposed to improve his appetite 
faced with local police forces that are too busy too frightened 
or too partisan shekhar directed his agents to take over 
investigations in kashmir at least 300 people have been killed in 
the northwestern state since the government cracked down on a 
moslem separatist movement in january 
just south of kashmir bureau agents are investigating 
separatist violence by sikh extremists in punjab state 
many punjab police are virtually confined to their barracks 
because they are favorite targets of sikh extremists who have 
killed more than 5800 people in punjab since 1987 
in assam a remote northeastern state bureau agents are looking 
closely at the bodos an animist tribe that believes spirits live 
in rocks and trees the bodos want a separate state within india 
and have attacked assamese hindus 
the real work of shekhars agency however is fighting 
corruption 
indias british colonial rulers established the central bureau 
of investigation soon after world war ii to investigate links 
between indian businessmen and the government that work continued 
after independence in 1947 
of the 1200 cases filed by the bureaus 3907 agents every 
year about 1000 are corruptionrelated shekhar said 
corruption is the grease of south asias wheels 
traffic cops routinely take baksheesh small cash payments 
to ignore violations businessmen consider payoffs and kickbacks 
part of the job 
shekhar said the problem has been growing 
industrialization inflation development unemployment all 
contribute to it he said and the facets that give impetus to 
corruption are getting more and more pronounced 
preliminary charges have been filed in three cases involving 
members of gandhis government two concern alleged payment of 
bribes by europes airbus industrie consortium and 
hawaldtswerkedeutsche werft a west german submarine manufacturer 
a former highlevel civil servant was charged in connection with 
a 147 billion airbus deal for 38 planes and a former defense 
secretary was named in a case involving four west german subs worth 
334 million 
the agency also has filed preliminary charges related to a 14 
billion artillery contract with the swedish arms manufacturer ab 
bofors bureau investigators have charged bofors with cheating 
india out of 37 million and indian government officials not 
identified with criminal misconduct 
charges related to an alleged political dirty tricks campaign 
against the son of prime minster singh are expected soon 
western diplomats say the growing scope of bureau responsibily 
is a sign local police cannot cope with the level and complexity of 
crime in india 
it also indicates they say that the central government does 
not trust local officials 
under these circumstances its easy for the law enforcment 
process to break down a diplomat said on condition of 
anonymity the bureau is stretched too thin they dont have good 
relations with local police and the crooks keep committing crimes 
critics say many of the bureaus investigations are politically 
motivated 
charges of corruption haunted the gandhi administration singh 
formerly gandhis finance minister quit the government when his 
corruption investigations were stymied 
diplomats say there appears to be vindictiveness in the 
investigations and cite the one concerning the prime ministers 
son 
by forcing the bureau to concentrate on what many consider a 
minor case singhs administration is using law enforcement to 
fight its political battles another western diplomat said 
shekhar denied his bureau could be used for political purposes 
our work has nothing to with politics he said if we 
think the case is legitimate we investigate 
shekhar made his mark late in his career when he led the 
investigation of one of indias biggest bank robberies the theft 
of 335 million from the punjab national bank in 1987 
ten of the original 24 suspects wound up dead but shekhar says 
the police didnt kill them 
several others disappeared and only a few were convicted and 
jailed in the indian context the case was considered a success 
the director general looks at his current post in a similar 
light incremental steps can be taken but no major changes should 
be expected 
if we can set an example with one or two corruption cases i 
suppose we are doing our job shekhar said but then again 
nobody could pay any attention

most of the increase would benefit the food stamp program 
described by frac as our best and most consistent line of defense 
against hunger 
as written the bill also provides increases of 70 million in 
each of the next two fiscal years for the commodities program known 
as tefap temporary emergency food assistance program 
this temporary emergency program began eight years ago and was 
formalized in 1983 as the reagan administration began using 
nonprofit agencies to distribute butter and cheese acquired under 
the dairy pricesupport program 
along with reducing stockpiles the primary objective tefap 
also played a key role in expanding the nonprofit food network 
critics call it a poorly targeted handout program lacking 
nutritional goals supporters point to the delivery of 65 billion 
pounds of food much of it high in protein to feeding programs 
otherwise largely dependent upon food industry waste 
the mickey leland bill also continues through 1995 current 
funding levels of 32 million a year for private soup kitchens 
which will still be necessary despite increased public spending 
the nation will not see a major difference in terms of soup 
and bread lines says j larry brown chairman of the physician 
task force food stamps will reach more people and last a little 
longer but people will still run out of food stamps because the 
basic level is so inadequate to begin with 
brown and others worry that nonprofit programs are becoming a 
way for the government to hand off responsibility permanently 
many of todays federal nutrition programs food stamps women 
infants and children wic school lunches and breakfasts and 
senior nutrition were started or expanded to fight an epidemic of 
hunger discovered in the late 1960s within a decade domestic 
hunger had been greatly reduced 
but during the 80s spending cuts dramatically diminished the 
scope of these and other safety net programs at a time when 
high unemployment a downscaling of wages and rapidly rising 
housing costs left millions of americans below the poverty line 
the epidemic returned 
a thousand points of light do not hold a candle to 
wellmanaged and adequately funded public programs the main 
argument for not improving these programs and stamping out domestic 
hunger is a financial one that priorities must be set for 
government spending in the face of the budget deficit says rob 
fersh fracs executive director 
if emergency food programs represent a gain for the poor thats 
acceptable says sociologist janet poppendieck director of the 
center for the study of family policy at new yorks hunter college 
if they begin to substitute either for individuals or at the 
level of public policy theyre destructive 
the new york city interfaith hunger task force in 198788 found 
many nonprofit agencies serving substantial numbers who may 
have been eligible for public assistance but were not adequately 
or consistently informed of their availability some 
ineligibility and delayed benefits resulted from bureaucratic 
inertia 
only 12 percent of 1970 clients surveyed in 1987 at new york 
food pantries were experiencing actual emergencies 
massive cuts in food stamps are a major factor behind the long 
lines at soup kitchens and food pantries between 1982 and 1985 
the program lost 7 billion 13 percent of its budget 
benefits average less than 57 cents per person per meal and 
reach 19 million people per month only about half of the number 
who are eligible for them participation dropped from 68 out of 100 
people at or below poverty in 1980 to 59 out of 100 in 1985 and 
nationwide studies have shown that many households run out of food 
stamps five to 10 days before the end of the month 
with the cuts came administrative crackdowns churning 
recipients from the rolls for minor offenses food stamp recipients 
may have to fill out application forms that can run 18 pages and 
require complex calculations

poppendieck who analyzed depressionera food policy in her 1986 
book breadlines kneedeep in wheat sees the reliance on 
emergency programs as a dramatic reversal in the direction in 
which social provision had been evolving in the united states 
that direction toward an increased federal role resulted in 
greater standardization of benefits safeguarded recipients rights 
and enabled them to buy their own food just like their neighbors 
by contrast volunteer programs vary from city to city and state 
to state regardless of how well they may be treated clients 
have no enforceable rights whatsoever poppendieck says 
and far from making the lives of poor people similar to those 
of the rest of society emergency food programs tend to segregate 
the poor into separate programs available only to those who assert 
their poverty 
unlike federal programs nonprofit efforts are fragile and 
fragmented heavily dependent on volunteers donations and good 
will poppendieck says many lack adequate facilities and are 
subject to neighborhood opposition how long can we reasonably 
expect churches and other nonprofits to keep up the enormous 
effort required to respond to the emergency 
in some quarters there is talk of closing soup kitchens and 
food pantries to force government to do more 
some days says nancy amidei i would want to shut down 
all the soup kitchens and food pantries in america 
if that sounds too cruel every time someone walks through a 
door needing food i would want the first action to be to call a 
congressman and say i have a woman here with two children she 
cant feed where should i send her 
put the onus back on them 
christina walker who recently resigned as executive director of 
the new york food and hunger hotline worries about the possible 
legacy of continued reliance on emergency services 
we are creating a large disenfranchised population that may 
never find its way back to mainstream american life people are not 
going to live on handouts all through childhood then go to work 
for citicorp 
for nonprofit agencies the struggle to keep up with demand for 
food leaves little time for advocacy you wont have to change 
much in society if those people never have the time to raise their 
voice says michael lipsky a political science professor at the 
massachusetts institute of technology 
for some service providers competition for funding leads to 
compromises that may not always serve clients interests 
to get more bang for your buck you need bigger programs 
says bill bolling executive director of the atlanta community food 
bank 
but the bigger the program the more dehumanizing it is if 
youre feeding 50 people a day you can have an accountable 
relationship if youre feeding 500 a day nothing can happen 
marc thibodeau a former boston food bank board member calls 
the 80s the decade of the sidewalk the soup kitchen lines now 
its the 90s and people cant believe these people are still 
there the trend is to turn away 
meanwhile a new generation is coming of age 
im now teaching students who have grown up with soup kitchens 
and food pantries and who consider such emergency provisions to 
be the normal way of dealing with destitution says poppendieck 
as she walks the streets of new york christina walker finds 
herself thinking about the children of the 90s what will their 
picture of this country be when they grow up it will be a 
different country yet kids will grow up and think this is the way 
weve always been 
i think we did the right thing in the beginning in thinking 
we must get these people in off the streets but now its 
snowballed out of control 
a storefront pentecostal church in a poor neighborhood with 50 
congregants themselves dirtpoor scrounging food of questionable 
nutritional value from a bunch of sources thats become our 
safety net 
there really is a big irony here one that lots of people are 
wrestling with in setting out initially to fix something weve 
become part of whats broken

western europe waited for the 
germans in spring 1940 but france felt safe behind the maginot 
line and holland hoped to stay neutral the dutch army drafted 
cornelius stam and gave him an 1895 rifle 
we didnt do a damn thing really stam recalled last month 
we were just sitting in the sun when adolf hitlers death 
machine rolled west on may 10 1940 casting western europe into 
what winston churchill called a long night of barbarism 
the onslaught by bombers tanks and 2 million wehrmacht and ss 
soldiers caught the victims unprepared 
nazi germany needed only four days to conquer the netherlands 
which had been neutral in world war i hitlers legions swept the 
patchwork defenses aside and destroyed the dutch fighting spirit 
with carpet bombing of rotterdam 
two decades of peace in europe had ended nearly eight months 
earlier with the german invasion of poland britain and france 
declared war on germany as a result but there had been little 
combat in the west 
when the germans invaded officers had us march around at 4 in 
the morning toting our rifles on our shoulders out of sheer 
madness stam said in an interview 
at dawn may 10 german bombers destroyed major military 
airfields in holland and hitlers troops poured across the border 
tanks directed by field marshall gerd von rundstedt began a sweep 
through belgium luxembourg and northern france to the atlantic 
meeting little resistance 
belgium surrendered may 28 after 6552 civilians and 6236 
soldiers had been killed luxembourgs government fled to london on 
the invasions first day 
unlike wilhelmina the dutch queen king leopold iii of belgium 
decided to remain in his country under german occupation leopold 
ultimately became so deeply compromised that he was forced to 
abdicate in 1950 
soon after belgium capitulated german troops turned south 
toward paris 
about 70000 french soldiers were killed in the futile 
sixweeklong attempt to halt the german advance more than all the 
americans killed in vietnam 
france relied on the maginot line along the german border a 
static defense system based on the tactics of world war i the 
tanks of german panzer divisions swept around the northern end into 
france by cutting through the ardennes forest 
the dutch depended on the water line last used successfully in 
the 16th century war for independence from spain which involved a 
ring of flooded land around amsterdam rotterdam and the hague the 
germans sent waves of paratroopers against whom flood was no 
defense 
it was a very fine morning said arie dekker who was a 
15yearold office boy near rotterdam when the paratroopers came 
the pilots were waving at us theyd been told they were 
protecting us from the british 
queen wilhelmina and her government fled to london on may 13 
the next day when organized resistance was all but crushed the 
luftwaffe returned to rotterdam for a preannounced bombing raid 
that leveled its central district and killed about 800 people 
the sun totally vanished said dekkers wife cornelia 
whose family lived in krimpen aan de lek a nearby town at 
first we thought it was a thunderstorm 
in four days the german offensive had killed 2600 dutch 
civilians and 2000 soldiers it began a fiveyear occupation 
horror of starvation slave labor and deportations to death camps 
as holland fell von rundstedts tanks linked up with another 
german army group from the north to encircle british and french 
troops near the port of dunkirk in northern france 
despite concentrated german air and artillery attacks 340000 
allied soldiers escaped to england over a 10day period most of 
them in small boats commandeered for the rescue 
brig gen charles de gaulle who later commanded the free 
french forces from england led one of the few french 
counteroffensives near abbeville in the northwest the germans 
bombed abbeville to rubble may 20 
there was nothing left after the bombing said louis 
werheim who was 6 at the time 
werheim and his family fled before the raid when they returned 
he said there were bodies of french soldiers in our courtyard 
theyd been shot by the germans 
on june 22 france agreed to an armistice twothirds of its 
territory was occupied and a collaborationist government under 
marshal henriphilippe petain the world war i hero ran the 
unoccupied southeastern sector 
about 15 million french soldiers were taken prisoner and held 
until the end of the war 
civilian hardship followed military surrender 
men were shipped from the occupied countries to work as slave 
labor in the german war industry the netherlands then primarily 
an agricultural economy was gradually stripped of food to feed the 
conquerors 
starvation spread through the country the hunger winter of 
1944 is one of the dutch peoples strongest collective memories 
nazi officials used the dutch penchant for keeping meticulous 
records to track down the countrys 150000 jews and shipped them 
to death camps only 6000 survived 
the most famous war victim in the the netherlands was anne 
frank a jewish teenager born in germany whose diary written in 
hiding with her family is perhaps the most poignant memorial to 
the death camps 
most of the jews in belgium luxembourg and france also died in 
the camps 
antinazi underground movements were organized in the occupied 
countries 
after the dutch surrender stam used his position with the 
nazirun amsterdam labor bureau to obtain ration cards for jews and 
resistance fighters in hiding and to hamper deportation of workers 
for slave labor 
dekker the office boy was 18 when the germans sent him to 
hamburg to work in a shipyard he spent three years there and 
returned after the war with a busload of dutch jews who survived 
the neuengamme concentration camp near hamburg

fifty years ago hitlers blitzkrieg overran 
belgium the netherlands and france now they are partners of 
germany but cautious about the prospect of a unified powerhouse 
next door 
the french whose maginot line could not stop the germans now 
lead an effort to guarantee them a central role in a singlemarket 
western europe 
french belgian and dutch officials say the closer the ties the 
better suggesting a nonaligned germany would cause greater 
concern 
i have always believed the arbitrary division of germany was 
senseless said foreign minister roland dumas of france but 
the situation inherited from the war cannot be improved without the 
participation of other countries 
west germany is the largest trading partner of all three 
countries conquered by german forces in a sixweek onslaught that 
began may 10 1940 its relationship with france is particularly 
close encompassing everything from military cooperation to 
cultural television programming 
frenchgerman friendship is more alive than ever president 
francois mitterrand once a german prisoner of war said at the end 
of a harmonious twoday summit in late april with chancellor helmut 
kohl 
in normandy which was devastated by the battles that followed 
the allied invasion of june 1944 dozens of towns have established 
twin city relationships with german municipalities 
stateowned aerospatiale of france recently began a joint 
helicopter production project with messerschmittboelkowblohm 
which made many of hitlers warplanes 
among the most vivid symbols of frenchgerman reconciliation is 
a joint army brigade 2100 soldiers from each country being 
deployed in west germany 
brigade officers have overcome language difficulties and even a 
potential wardrobe dispute the men will wear frenchstyle blue 
berets but tilt them to the right in accordance with german custom 
klaus becher and ingo kolboom of the research institute of the 
german society for foreign policy have proposed stationing 
additional frenchgerman brigades in east germany after 
unification to replace soviet troops 
the frenchgerman relationship dates to a treaty signed in 1963 
by president charles de gaulle and chancellor konrad adenauer the 
governments have closer and more systematic consultation on 
political military and economic matters than any other two in 
western europe 
polls indicate the french and germans consider each other their 
closest foreign friends kohl and mitterrand embodied this 
sentiment in 1984 when they joined hands at verdun the world war i 
battle site in dedicating a plaque consecrating the reconciliation 
of france and germany 
there appear to be few plans for marking the 50th anniversary of 
the german entry into paris june 14 or the french surrender june 
22 
the french dont like to celebrate defeat said dominique 
moisi associate director of the french institute of foreign 
relations he suggested the french would focus on de gaulle who on 
june 18 1940 made his first radio appeal from england to his 
countrymen to resist the occupation 
moisi said in an interview that fear of a powerful united 
germany is based more on the french lack of confidence in their 
ability to compete than mistrust of germany 
political analyst pierre lellouche wrote in le point magazine 
in paris where they officially pretend to rejoice at german 
unity they worry in private about its consequences 
some french officials anticipate the development of a german 
superpower that would reduce france to a secondary role he 
said 
wolfgang bergsdorf a kohl adviser cited a poll recently 
indicating 68 percent of french people favored german unification 
unhappily the politicians in france in contrast to the 
general population are reticent now that german unity has become 
more than a sacred wish bergsdorf said 
the belgian and dutch economies are even more intertwined with 
west germany than the french the dutch guilder exchange rate 
closely follows the deutschmark and hollands interest rates are 
virtually based on the west german central banks prime rate 
queen beatrix and her mother juliana are married to germans 
both husbands gained acceptance by learning dutch and trying to 
understand the country but the dutch tend to view germans as 
arrogant and authoritarian 
resentment of the wartime occupation is largely responsible and 
german tourists who assume everyone speaks their language and 
accepts their currency reinforce the attitude 
shopkeepers in the border city of enschede asked west germans to 
stay away may 5 the anniversary of liberation from the nazis 
we dont think its appropriate to be confronted with germans 
then especially for older people who have been through the war 
a spokesman ba sassen told the amsterdam newspaper de telegraaf 
hollands european cup soccer victory over west germany in 1988 
inspired much antigerman emotion teenagers born decades after 
the war took to the streets chanting how the krauts are silent 
and revenge at last 
a reporter asked a dutch official at a european economic 
community meeting in december why his delegation seemed reluctant 
to mention world war ii 
we have certainly not forgotten the war he said but you 
must understand that with germany being a major partner we cannot 
say these things publicly so we let the russians say them

the french thought the next war would be as static 
as the last and built the maginot line to be an impregnable 
defense so the germans changed the rules and bypassed it with 
tanks and planes 
a generation of officers on both sides learned in world war i 
that unprotected infantry had little chance against artillery 
barrages and machinegun fire 
the french decided they needed fortifications against which 
german divisions would hurl themselves until they weakened and 
could be driven back the germans decided to go around and over 
fortifications with new forms of attack paratroops dive bombers 
and above all the battle tank 
frances line was named for andre maginot defense minister in 
192932 and stretched along 200 miles of the border with germany 
it included artillery protected by concrete 10 feet thick 
railroad tracks sunk into concrete formed barriers to stop tanks 
until gunners could blow them to pieces 
many fortifications were underground connected by a 
subterranean railway tens of thousands of soldiers could live in 
the vast bunkers 
we are always the invaded we are always the ones who suffer 
we are always the ones to be sacrificed said maginot who was 
wounded in world war i he died after eating bad oysters at a new 
years banquet in 1932 
his fortifications were strong but not long enough 
an agreement made before world war i committed france to defend 
belgium if it was attacked french politicians felt extending the 
line to the english channel would imply their generals preferred 
hiding in bunkers to defending belgian territory 
that left a doorway 200 miles wide including some of the most 
tankfriendly country in europe if hitler chose to violate belgian 
neutrality 
when france and britain declared war on germany after it invaded 
poland most of frances army waited in the maginot bunkers for a 
german attack that never came 
nine months of phony war eroded morale and readiness a 
politician who visited the maginot line wrote of being greeted by a 
senior officer wearing bedroom slippers 
french headquarters fell into despair after belgium and the 
netherlands collapsed the subsequent evacuation from dunkirk left 
the coastal plains of northern france wide open 
field marshal heinz guderians panzers breached the somme in 
force june 5 within a week 49 german divisions had crushed 
virtually all defenses in northern and eastern france 
on june 13 the wehrmacht turned on the maginot line and 
captured it from the rear more than 500000 men were taken 
prisoner most without firing a shot at the enemy and france 
signed an armistice june 22 
some of the bunkers now are open to the public as relics of 
military history others are used as mushroom farms

a congressman who opposes smoking says 
television networks are breaking the law against broadcasting 
cigarette advertisements by showing billboards at sports events 
somewhere someone decided that congress didnt mean it and 
that this is not a statute that is going to be enforced rep 
thomas luken dohio said monday nobody seems to care 
the justice department has said in the past they dont believe 
it is the best use of scant prosecutorial resources to run these 
things down 
lukens comments came after a hearing at which he accused the 
networks of colluding with the cigarette industry to skirt the law 
capital citiesabc and rjr nabisco makers of winston salem 
and camel cigarettes jointly own espn cable television he said 
loews which owns all of lorillard tobacco makers of kent 
newport and true also owns about 25 percent of cbs 
the networks make a lot of money broadcasting sporting events 
sponsored by cigarette companies whose logos continually show up on 
the screen said luken chairman of the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials 
if the tv camera cant avoid the logo the network shouldnt 
broadcast the event he said 
executives from nbc cbs and abc all said that displaying 
billboards during sports coverage is often unavoidable and they 
dont consider it against the ban on television cigarette 
advertising that has been in effect since 1971 
in auto racing for example arenas are adorned with ads that 
the vehicles continually drive by said richard gitter nbc vice 
president of standards and practices 
the tobacco companies make the deal to display their logos with 
the arena and the network must either accept the event with the 
advertising or not broadcast it said gitter 
alfred schneider abc vice president for policy and standards 
said his network tries to keep such billboards off camera 
the only references to the cigarette company which we permit 
are for the purpose of identifying the event by its proper name 
said schneider 
luken also said the television industry isnt doing enough to 
publicize the health hazards of smoking even when the public 
pushes for it 
he noted that the excise tax on cigarettes in california was 
raised on public demand to pay for antismoking advertisements on 
television 
these ads are controversial and one network capital 
citiesabc has refused to run one of these ads luken said 
all the executives said their networks had broadcast warnings 
about cigarette smoking 
but gitter said nbcs priority right now is alcohol and drug 
abuse schneider said abc is concentrating on antidrug abuse and 
literacy messages 
beth waxman bressan a cbs vice president said her network fed 
affiliates 2200 public service messages last year on a wide 
variety of topics including alcohol abuse aids the environment 
and smoking and health 
under questioning from luken however she said she did not know 
how many actually aired

prices received by farmers last month rose 07 
percent from their march average according to preliminary figures 
released by the agriculture department 
the april increase lifted the departments prices received 
index 2 percent above the yearearlier average 
but revisions reported monday also showed the index has declined 
about 2 percent from the record level set in january a month ago 
preliminary figures for march showed an increase in the price 
index instead there was a decline from february to march 
john buche of the departments national agricultural statistics 
service said the downward swing in the march index instead of the 
increase initially reported a month ago was due primarily to price 
declines for vegetables and some other crops in the last half of 
the month 
preliminary prices are reported mostly on the basis of midmonth 
averages and then updated the following month thus the 
preliminary april figures will be revised in the may report 
according to the latest revisions the index rose 34 percent in 
january from its december average before dropping 13 percent in 
both february and march 
prices of raw agricultural products can swing widely during a 
single month and for that reason and others are not considered 
reliable indicators by themselves of overall food price trends at 
the consumer level 
higher prices for oranges corn potatoes and cattle were mostly 
responsible for the overall price increase from march the 
departments agricultural statistics board said in its preliminary 
report 
lower prices for tomatoes milk eggs and broilers partly offset 
the gains for the other commodities most prices are midapril 
averages that will be revised next month 
new quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet 
expenses were up 11 percent from january and averaged 34 percent 
more than in april 1989 
since january higher prices for feeder pigs and feeder cattle 
and calves were moderated by lower fuel and energy prices the 
report said 
prices of cars and trucks farm chemicals tractors and 
selfpropelled machinery were generally up from last years 
surveys most retail seed prices were lower than a year ago 
usda economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990 may 
be in the range of 54 billion to 58 billion compared with about 
53 billion in 1989 the record was 572 billion in 1988 
net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left 
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash 
expenses it includes government payments and proceeds from crops 
grown previously but sold during the year 
another method taking into account changes in inventories 
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that 
1990 net farm income may be in a range of 45 billion to 49 
billion compared with 49 billion last year 
consumer food prices are forecast by usda economists to rise 3 
percent to 5 percent this year after posting an average gain of 57 
percent in 1989 the sharpest rise since 1981 
based on the preliminary figures the april price index for 
livestock and poultry dropped 12 percent from march but still 
averaged 97 percent more than a year earlier 
milk prices dropped an additional 60 cents in april to an 
average of 1310 per l00 pounds even so the preliminary april 
price was up 70 cents from april 1989 the farm price of milk rose 
to a record 16 per hundredweight in december 
crop prices overall rose 31 percent from march but averaged 7 
percent below the yearearlier level fruit prices led by oranges 
and grapefruit were up 11 percent from march and by the same 
margin of 11 percent from a year ago 
the index for commercial vegetables dropped 13 percent from 
march and averaged 28 percent below the yearearlier level 
reflecting abundant tomato supplies and low prices 
tomato prices were reported at 16 per 100 pounds down from 
3280 in march and 5580 in april 1989 onions however rose to 
23 per 100 pounds from 1960 in march and 1090 a year earlier 
prices of potatoes and dry beans which are measured 
collectively increased 14 percent from march to april and were up 
13 percent from a year earlier 
the report said 
cattle averaged 75 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally 
up from 7420 in march and 7010 in april 1989 those are 
averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 5290 per 100 pounds compared with 5130 in 
march and 3690 a year earlier 
corn at 252 a bushel was up from 237 in march but was 
just short of the 256 yearearlier average 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 351 per bushel compared with 349 in march and 403 a 
year earlier 
rice averaged 726 per 100 pounds compared with 750 in 
march and 674 in april 1989 
soybeans were 562 per bushel compared with 565 in march 
and 729 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 648 cents per pound up from 
641 in march and 587 a year earlier 
eggs were 714 cents per dozen compared with 793 in march and 
661 in april 1989 
milk was 1310 per 100 pounds down from 1370 in march but 
above the average of 1240 a year ago 
broilers were 332 cents per pound live weight down from 364

baxter international inc a hospital supply 
company that was on the arab leagues blacklist was taken off the 
list after selling a plant in israel and opening another in syria 
a newspaper reported today 
baxter executives have denied that the company sought to curry 
favor from the league by selling the plant in israel a move that 
would violate a us law forbidding american companies from 
participating in a foreign boycott the wall street journal said 
the plants in israel and syria both synthesize intravenous body 
fluids 
jewish leaders are demanding an explanation from baxter 
a memorandum on file in the arab leagues boycott office in the 
syrian capitol of damascus suggests the sale and the delisting were 
linked the newspaper said 
a washington businessman and former baxter official dr richard 
fuisz gave the journal a copy of the memo and documents about 
baxters middle east operations 
fuisz had sent another memo copy to the baxter directors 
the memo says baxter sought removal from the blacklist through 
its swiss subsidiary baxter ag it also says that another 
subsidiary international medical technologies provided 
documentation of the sale of baxters israel plant and promised not 
to do any more business with israel the journal reported 
baxter senior vice president and general counsel g marshall 
abbey said international medical technologies did not supply 
information directly to the leagues committee he also said the 
company has not violated the law 
the company said it never contacted the boycott committee to ask 
to be taken off the list the journal said 
abbey said the directors audit committee has hired a lawyer 
from the new york firm of calwalader wickersham amp taft to conduct 
an independent investigation 
neither the commerce department nor the securities and exchange 
commission which are reviewing the companys middle east 
activities would comment 
jess n hordes washington director of the antidefamation 
league of bnai brith said the circumstances raise serious 
questions about the process baxter went through in getting off

construction spending fell in march for the 
first time this year the government said today down 14 percent 
as the weather returned to normal and mortgage interest rates 
continued to rise 
the commerce department said residential nonresidential and 
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 4325 billion after jumps of 32 percent in 
february and 24 percent in january 
the decline was the largest since a 15 percent fall in february 
1989 
despite the drop spending was 38 percent above that of march 
1989 when it totaled 4168 billion 
david berson chief economist for the federal national mortgage 
association had said after the february report that construction 
spending would begin to lose its seasonal benefit in march 
we expect it to start leveling off if not decline because it 
will no longer have the seasonal boost and also because of 
increasing interest rates he said 
after the fourth coldest december on record january broke the 
record as the warmest february also was unseasonably warm and 
temperatures during both months induced builders to get 
construction under way early 
mortgage rates which started the year in the single digits 
ranged between 1022 percent and 1034 percent during march when 
temperatures also returned to normal 
residential building continued to rise in march up 18 percent

soybean futures prices surged this morning on the 
chicago board of trade leading the grain markets higher in a rally 
that reflected thin market conditions due to the may day holiday in 
europe 
with the early spurt the soybean market resumed the upward 
trend that characterized the market last week amid signs of slow 
brazilian soybean exports and fears of a hot dry summer in the 
midwest 
those factors have been largely discounted though and analysts 
said todays surge suggests few players are willing to sell a 
market that has recently been so strong 
theres a vacuum of sellers at the moment thats the best 
explanation you can give said anne frick senior oilseeds 
analyst at prudentialbache securities inc 
frick also noted that many overseas markets are closed today for 
may day making for thin trading conditions and increased 
volatility 
in early trading wheat futures were cent lower to 5 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in may at 373 a bushel 
corn was cent to 2 cents higher with may at 284 a bushel oats

president bush wants federal deposit insurance 
corp chairman l william seidman to resign the washington post 
reported today quoting unnamed administration sources 
bush in a meeting with the top sampl bailout official two weeks 
ago reportedly suggested now would be a good time for the 69year 
old seidman to leave the newspaper said he had been appointed by 
president reagan in 1985 and his term expires in 1991 
seidman in a telephone interview from michigan declined to 
comment on the story today and said he had promised not to divulge 
what he discussed with the president however he noted that in the 
past he has said he planned to leave his post after getting the 
bailout agency off to a good start 
a month ago he announced ambitious plans to sell or close 140 
sampls by the end of june and seidman said today that would be a 
good start 
an industry source who spoke to the associated press on 
condition of anonymity said white house officials confirmed that 
they would not stand in seidmans way if he leaves 
the chairman of the fdic serves independently and cannot be 
fired by the president but the post quoting two administration 
sources familiar with the meeting said bush wants to name his 
own chairman 
its no secret we would not be upset if he leaves its not 
like were trying to talk him into staying the newspaper quoted 
a source present at the meeting as saying 
white house press spokesmen did not immediately respond to a 
request for comment 
seidman who enjoys strong support from both democrats and 
republicans in congress has been dropping hints for nearly a year 
that he would not serve out his term 
he has feuded with deputy treasury secretary john robson and 
white house chief of staff john sununu over the conduct of the 
bailout however he also has given no indication of leaving 
immediately 
the chairman of the fdic is considered the most powerful banking 
regulator although the chairman of the federal reserve board has 
more influence over the economy 
the fivemember fdic board administers deposit insurance funds 
for both commercial banks and savings and loans the agency is the 
chief federal regulator of statechartered banks and backup 
regulator of sampls and federallychartered banks the board also 
manages the resolution trust corp which supervises the sale and 
closing of insolvent thrifts

corp bonds said it plans to elect two additional directors to the

in a row

675 percent junior preferred stock said in a filing with the

its right to add two directors to the 11member board

are missed according to texas air parent of eastern airlines and 
continental airlines 
painewebber is the second party to give such notice to the sec 
last week mark schwarzman a connecticut investor said he 
controls 68 percent of the same class of preferred stock and may 
seek representation on the board

admitted inside trader dennis levine whose 
arrest led to the fall of ivan boesky and other wall street 
figures said his values eroded in the dealcrazy 1980s when 
milliondollar profits seemed insignificant 
i will regret my mistakes forever the former investment 
banker said in a firstperson article in the may 21 issue of 
fortune magazine which was released tuesday 
no one led me down the garden path levine said for 
the hard work and creativity i brought to my investment banking 
career i was well rewarded when i broke the law i was punished 
the system works 
it was levines first public comment on the illegal dealings 
that ended with his 1986 arrest since he was released from federal 
prison last year levine repeatedly has refused interview requests 
levine has set up his own mergers and acquisitions advisory firm 
and has lectured on ethics at top business schools including 
columbia and new york universities and the university of 
pennsylvanias wharton school 
a fortune spokeswoman said levine was paid to write the article 
she declined to specify the amount but said it was a normal 
freelance fee 
in the article a repentant levine traces his rise from a 
middleclass queens ny neighborhood to a managing directors 
suite at drexel burnham lambert inc from which he helped major 
takeover deals 
levine was involved in some of the 1980s biggest deals 
including ronald perelmans takeover of revlon inc and carl 
icahns proxy fight against phillips petroleum co 
the daily exposure to such deals the pursuit of larger and 
larger transactions and the numbing effect of 60 to 100hour work 
weeks helped erode my values and distort my judgment levine said 
in this unbelieveable world of billions and billions of 
dollars the millions i made by trading on nonpublic information 
seemed almost insignificant he said 
in his illicit dealings levine parlayed 39750 much of it 
borrowed from family members into 115 million over seven years 
using illegal tips on upcoming deals he set up offshore bank 
accounts and left instructions on how his trades were to be handled 
to avoid detection 
levine had a network of sophisticated insiders with whom he 
would swap deal information levine said boesky the former stock 
speculator would call him at home well before 6 am to ferret 
out information before trading 
levine said he would have gotten 24 million for supplying 
boesky with information but never received a penny because he 
was arrested first levine served 15 months in a federal prison 
camp in pennsylvania 
using information supplied by levine federal investigators 
nailed boesky who paid 100 million in penalties and pleaded 
guilty to one felony to settle insider trading charges boesky was 
released from federal custody in april after serving two years of a 
threeyear term 
levine said his scheme began crumbling when several bank 
executives were detected mimicking his trades which were executed 
via a swiss bank in the bahamas 
with the government in hot pursuit levine said he drove around 
manhattan in his bmw frantically calling his family and lining up 
an attorney on the car phone his unsuspecting wife laurie was 
furious he said 
pleading guilty to four criminal charges before a federal judge 
was a humbling experience perhaps as difficult as watching his 
daughter learn to walk in a prison waiting room he said 
levine said he has formed adasar group an advisory firm he 
named after his children adam and sarah though barred for life 
from working for a securities firm levine is allowed to advise 
companies 
levine said his clients are smaller than they used to be 
but he said his reentry into the business world has been met with 
fairness and compassion

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed 
mostly lower tuesday on the chicago board of trade paced by a late 
break in the soybean market after a technically inspired rally 
drove prices to new ninemonth highs 
the heavy trading volume and whipsaw action recalled the drought 
summer of 1988 when soybean prices swung wildly after each new bit 
of weather data said jerry zusel manager of balfour maclaine 
corps floor operations at the board of trade 
but unlike two years ago tuesdays rally was driven almost 
entirely by bullish technical patterns he said 
i havent heard any good fundamental explanations for why we 
ran up zusel said 
soybeans for may delivery touched 655 a bushel the highest 
price for a nearmonth soybean contract since july 28 before the 
rally ran out of steam 
the buying dried up the selling picked up and the lower you 
got the more selling you ran into zusel said 
he said the grain markets basically followed soybeans higher 
then retreated as soybean prices fell 
at the close of trading wheat futures were 6 cents lower to 2 
cents higher with the contract for delivery in may at 368 a 
bushel corn was 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher with may at 284 
a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents lower with may at 163 a 
bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with may at 629 a

the us industrial sector expanded slightly 
during april for the first time in a year led by sharp gains in 
new orders and exports the nations purchasing managers said in a 
survey released tuesday 
economists said last months data although stronger than 
expected hardly pointed to an economic rebound most of the 
surveyed manufacturers remained reluctant to add new jobs or expand 
their inventories they said 
in addition a government report released tuesday showed the 
recent rise in interest rates was depressing construction a major 
component of economic growth spending for residential 
nonresidential and government building fell 14 percent in march 
to a 13month low the commerce department said 
i still think were dealing with an economy that is kind of 
sputtering said robert a brusca chief financial economist for 
nikko securities co international it may not look like a 
recession but you have to draw the line well short of calling it 
vibrant 
the national association of purchasing management said its 
economic index rose to 502 percent in april from 488 percent the 
previous month a reading above 50 indicates the manufacturing 
economy generally is expanding below 50 that it is generally 
contracting 
the april reading followed 11 straight monthly declines and was 
the highest since last aprils 527 percent level the group said 
in a news release from its tempe ariz headquarters 
the index has averaged 481 percent for the first four months of 
1990 consistent with a 13 percent rise in the gross national 
product the group said 
robert j bretz chairman of the trade groups business survey 
committee and director of materials management at pitney bowes 
inc said the improvement reflected a significant gain in new 
orders particularly in exports 
the rebound should be sufficient to sustain solid production 
growth for several months and buoy the entire economy over the 
balance of the second quarter he said 
some economists werent as optimistic 
we think growth in the second quarter could be less than it 
was in the first said carol stone a senior economist for nomura 
securities inc businesses are still showing a cautious 
attitude 
stone said manufacturers have kept their inventories low and 
have been reluctant to permanantly fill jobs 
brusca said a significant portion of the growth reported in the 
april purchasing managers report came from the volatile automobile 
sector 
the report said new orders expanded for the third consecutive 
month during april the new orders index jumped to 555 percent 
from 504 percent in march 
new export orders were up for the 28th consecutive month as the 
seasonally unadjusted index rose to 605 percent from 595 percent 
the report said 74 percent of the groups members exported last 
month up from 71 percent in march and a three year high 
imports increased for the fourth consecutive month but at a 
slower pace than march seventysix percent of all members imported 
in april down from 78 percent the group said 
the production portion of the survey gained ground for the third 
consecutive month during april although growth was at a slower 
level than the previous month 53 percent vs 544 percent 
declining for the 14th consecutive month was the employment 
portion of the survey with the index falling to 451 percent from 
452 percent members continued to report they were hiring 
temporary workers and working overtime to handle increasing 
production activity rather than hiring new employees the group 
said 
inventories weakened for the 17th straight month that index was 
unchanged from march at 416 percent the secondlowest level 
since december 1986 
supplier deliveries were faster in april for the 12th 
consecutive month but 12 commodities were in short supply 
including bearings electric motors timber and some chemicals the 
group said 
meanwhile prices of goods rose after falling for 10 consecutive 
months about 17 commodities had higher prices up from 11 in 
march the group said 
the purchasing managers report is based on a monthly survey of 
purchasing executives at over 300 industrial companies most of the 
figures are adjusted for seasonal factors

bristol myerssquibb co shareholders on 
tuesday overwhelmingly defeated a proposal that would have banned 
the consumer products giant from peddling infant formula directly 
to the public 
but the measure received enough votes to remain on the agenda 
next year 
the infant formula resolution sponsored by 11 religious 
investors and supported by many pediatricians received 1656 
million votes or 49 percent of the total at the companys annual 
meeting in wilmington 
more than 3209 million votes were cast against with 3112 
million absentions the measure needed to gain at least 3 percent 
of the votes to remain on the ballot at the next annual meeting 
a substantial part of the threehour meeting was dominated by 
debate over the infantformula resolution which has aroused 
considerable interest as a contentious shareholder activist issue 
in the 1990 annual meeting season 
the measures supporters said bristol myerssquibb is misleading 
the public by suggesting that its infant formula marketed though 
gerber products co is as nutritious as breast milk 
they say it departs from the industry tradition of promoting 
formula only to physicians since last october television ads for 
the formula end with the phrase if it doesnt come from you 
shouldnt it come from gerber 
how can you persist in this commercially driven charade 
said dr frank a oski chairman of the department of pediatrics at 
johns hopkins school of medicine and a representative of the 
american academy of pediatrics 
he urged adoption of the resolution which would make bristol 
myerssquibb and gerber stop marketing the formula directly to 
mothers 
richard gelb the companys chairman and chief executive 
officer defended the marketing campaign by saying the 
advertisements make it clear that breast milk is superior to baby 
formula 
we support breastfeeding as we have said but we dont believe 
its quite as cut and dried gelb told reporters after the 
meeting concluded 
shareholders also defeated measures that would have forced the 
company to provide information about animal testing sever all ties 
to south africa and create oneyear terms for directors 
bristol myerssquibb based in new york is the result of the 
merger of the bristol myers and squibb companies last year it is 
the nations 50th largest industrial corporation with revenue of 
more than 94 billion in 1989

emerson electric co said tuesday that profits 
and sales both rose 56 percent in its second quarter but that 
earnings were reduced because of the companys guilty plea to 
overcharging the pentagon 
the increases came from continued strength in emersons capital 
goods markets which include assembly line machines motors and 
drives and gains made by various foreign subsidiaries and in 
overseas sales the company said 
profits for the period ending march 31 were 156 million or 70 
cents a share up from 148 million or 66 cents a share in the 
second quarter of 1989 
sales were 19 billion up from 18 billion for the same 
period in 1989 
emerson officials said earnings were reduced by more than 14 
million because of tuesdays guilty plea to making inflated cost 
estimates for electronic equipment it sold to the pentagon 
the settlement which included a 40000 fine and a 14 million 
civil settlement is about twice the amount that emersons 
subsidiary electronics amp space corp overcharged the pentagon 
from 1983 to 1987 
the guilty pleas to four counts of filing false statements ended 
a twoyear investigation by the us attorneys office in st 
louis the defense criminal investigative service the defense 
contract audit agency and the defense logistics agency 
the settlement resolves a number of open issues many of 
which preceded the investigation company chairman and chief 
executive charles knight said in a statement 
emerson owns companies that make tools for sears roebuck co 
skil power tools ceiling fans ladders and other products the 
company is also a leading supplier of compressors for 
refrigerators computer power systems and electric motors 
for the first six months of 1990 emersons profits were 298 
million or 134 a share up 47 percent from 285 million or 
127 a share for the first six months of 1989 
sales for the first half were flat 355 billion this year vs 
352 billion last year 
our capital goodsrelated businesses have record level 
backlogs and expect continued good sales performance as do our 
international operations knight said 
we are concerned however about the prospects for rising 
interest rates and softness in the domestic economy which will 
continue to impact our consumerrelated businesses he said

union texas petroleum holdings inc is 
considering putting itself on the auction block or taking other 
action to enhance the value of the nations secondlargest 
independent oil company 
if sold analysts say the company could fetch 225 billion 
the announcement monday of a possible sale came after kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co a leveraged buyout specialist said it may 
sell its 40 percent holding in union texas petroleum 
if the oil company is sold for 25 a share kohlberg kravis 
could earn a profit of about 750 million on stock it bought five 
years ago for 750 a share analysts speculated that kohlberg 
kravis agreed to the sale because it needs to shore up some souring 
investments 
kohlberg kravis owns safeway duracell and rjr nabisco which it 
took private last year in a 25 billion leveraged buyout the 
largest in history 
allied signal inc an aerospace and automotive parts 
conglomerate which owns 40 percent of union texas petroleum has 
previously said it wanted to sell its holding in the oil company 
if it decides to put itself up for sale union texas petroleum 
said it does not expect the sale to be completed before november 
a sale could mean lost jobs for many of the companys 1900 
employees including 900 in houston if a major oil company buys it 
and consolidates operations or if union texas petroleum assets are 
sold separately 
high prices paid recently for oil and natural gas assets are the 
key to the board of directors decision said carol l cox a 
spokeswoman for union texas petroleum 
houston oilman roy m huffington last month sold his extensive 
indonesian natural gas interests for an estimated 600 million to 
an affiliate of taiwans national oil company the deal also 
included about 50 million in houston real estate 
huffington was a partner with union texas petroleum in an 
indonesian partnership that is the largest gas producer in 
indonesia one of the hottest exploration areas in the world 
union texas petroleum owns about 38 percent of the partnership 
union texas petroleum also has crude oil production and 
exploration operations in the north sea and the gulf of mexico and

chrysler corp said tuesday its first quarter 
profit tumbled 798 percent from last year and wall street 
analysts said that without a company costcutting program the slide 
would have been even worse 
a slumping auto market and the soaring costs of incentives aimed 
at reviving sales helped push chryslers net income down to 71 
million or 32 cents a share in the first three months of the year 
that was down from 351 million or 150 a share in the 
yearearlier quarter but it bettered analyst estimates that 
chrysler earnings would be around the breakeven point 
it shows the leanness and meanness of management hammering 
home on the costcutting front auto analyst john kirnan of 
kidder peabody amp co of new york said of the earnings report 
firstquarter revenue dropped to 756 billion from 966 
billion in the same period last year 
chrysler stock finished up 75 cents at 1525 a share tuesday on 
the new york stock exchange mondays close had been a 52week low 
last october chrysler began a program to slice 15 billion 
from its 26 billion annual budget by the end of this year partly 
by eliminating about 2500 whitecollar jobs 
some of the expense stemming from the cuts such as severance 
pay was written off in the fourth quarter chrysler lost 664 
million during that quarter due largely to a 577 million writeoff 
that covered plant closings and some of the costcutting expenses 
analysts have predicted that earnings would fall more than 75 
percent for general motors corp and ford motor co which report 
their results later this week 
chrysler appears to be heading toward its costcutting target 
analysts said estimating the automaker had cut 200 million in 
costs during the first quarter 
in a statement chrysler chairman lee iacocca said the companys 
cost cutting is certain to become a major competitive advantage 
for chrysler 
he said the company spent nearly twice as much on buyer 
incentives in the first quarter than it did a year ago chrysler 
offered a 1000 rebate on its popular minivans during january the 
first time for an incentive on the vehicles 
that boosted the sales rate for minivans but cut into profits 
furthermore since the january sales surge sales of chryslers cars 
and trucks including minivans have nosedived 
through the first quarter of the year chryslers domestic car 
and truck sales were 56 percent behind last years pace 
despite that analysts said they were encouraged by the 
longrange effects of the companys budgetcutting program 
i think it is encouraging to see how successful management has 
been in controlling costs kirnan said people still want to 
see the product side improve 
chryslers next major product change comes to market in the fall 
when the companys new minivans hit dealer showrooms chrysler 
derives much of its profit from minivan sales 
this summer chrysler will be shutting down both of its minivan 
assembly plants for four weeks apiece for retooling that could 
spell trouble for the companys second and thirdquarter profits 
i would not be surprised to see a red number for the third 
quarter said analyst david healy of barclaysbzw of new york 
but the second quarter should be profitable probably a good bit 
better than the first quarter 
the company said its chrysler financial corp subsidiary posted 
an 89 million profit for the first quarter up from 86 million in 
the fourth quarter of last year

said traders bought in case any bullish news emerges from an opec 
meeting wednesday

demand in the spot market for gasoline which spurred buying in the 
gas pits on the new york mercantile exchange 
it was a productled rally today said jerry samuels a vice 
president and energy broker at shearson lehman hutton inc it was 
not heavy volume 
the contract for june delivery of unleaded regular gasoline 
jumped 119 cents to 6103 cents a gallon after slipping 033 cent 
on monday contracts for later delivery also posted significant 
gains the may contract expired monday 
among other refined products traded on the new york merc home 
heating oil for june delivery advanced 152 cents to 5297 cents a 
gallon following mondays rise of 070 cent subsequent contracts 
ended with slightly smaller gains 
the june contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil rose 27 cents to settle at 1881 a 
42gallon barrel the contract had ended unchanged monday at 
1854 contracts for delivery during july through september

the opec meeting wednesday preoccupied oil traders as ministers

million barrels a day to shore up sagging world crude prices 
the cartels president algerian oil minister sadek boussena 
called the meeting to discuss curbing production prices have 
dropped by more than 20 percent since january 
energy analysts doubt opec will achieve enough of a production 
cutback to have a significant impact on prices

coast and in the houston area reflecting temporary needs of 
refiners samuels said this boosted futures buying interest

opec needs cut to oil production by as much as 15 
million barrels a day to help crude prices recover from their 
recent slide opecs president said tuesday as cartel ministers 
arrived for an emergency meeting 
the cartels president algerian oil minister sadek boussena 
called the meeting for wednesday to try to curb overproduction and 
boost prices that have dropped by more than 20 percent since 
january 
at issue is whether the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries should lower its official production ceiling or 
alternatively cut its output thus officially acknowledging 
violations of individual member quotas 
another issue is whether quota violators should bear the burden 
of any reduction or whether all 13 members should contribute 
equally 
analysts say violations by saudi arabia kuwait and the united 
arab emirates have pushed opec output above the cartels 
selfimposed ceiling of 221 million barrels a day for the first 
six months of the year 
on arriving in geneva iraqi oil minister issam alchalabi said 
opecs daily output currently was between 237 million barrels and 
24 million barrels 
overproduction has caused a glut during a time of seasonally 
slackening demand in the second quarter that has depressed prices 
well below opecs minimum reference price of 18 a barrel 
the average price of seven crudes monitored by opec stood at 
1537 per 42gallon barrel last week 
north sea brent blend the most widely traded international 
crude oil fetched a spot price of 1645 a barrel late tuesday in 
london unchanged from late monday 
the june contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude settled at 1881 a barrel tuesday on the new york 
mercantile exchange the nearmonth contract traded at more than 
24 in late january 
boussena said the single target is clear how to eliminate 
the surpluses existing in the market in order to allow a price 
recovery it is a single target and im certainly hopeful we can 
achieve that target 
asked how much output needed to be cut he responded it 
certainly is something between one and one and a half million 
barrels a day when asked if such a cut would come from current 
production he replied affirmatively 
chalabi said he was willing to consider reducing the official 
production ceiling through the end of june and that all members 
should contribute to an output cut 
he added we are not exceeding our quotas we are good guys 
the united arab emirates oil minister mana saeed otaiba 
maintained that his country was observing its daily quota of 1095 
million barrels analysts believe the uae is producing about twice 
that 
the ministers hadnt been expected to grapple with their 
official quotas and minimum reference price until they held their 
full regular midyear conference on june 25 
indonesias oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita said opec 
needs to solve its problem of overproduction quickly those 
overproducing will have to cut 
one oil trader who didnt want to be identified said he wasnt 
optimistic that decisive cuts would be achieved the meeting could 
give prices a psychological boost of 50 cents a barrel but they 
then should fall back a dollar a barrel he said 
officially the gathering is for opecs eightmember monitoring 
committee which only reviews markets and makes recommendations 
but all 13 members are expected to attend which means a full 
emergency conference can be called immediately 
opecs members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

the chairman of troubled defense group ferranti 
international plc said tuesday the company will writeoff very 
substantial assets during the year because of fraud at a us 
subsidiary

against earnings on the 198990 accounts would affect trading and 
extraordinary items but he did not specify an amount

the british electronics and defense equipment maker is 
struggling to recover from an alleged 353 million fraud involving 
phantom contracts at its us subsidiary international signal and 
control ltd based in lancaster pa 
discovery of the fraud led ferranti to write off about 300 
million and forced the company to arrange special shortterm 
credit facilities with its bankers 
in january ferranti agreed to sell its mostprized defense 
business its radar division to its main rival general electric 
co plc for 508 million gec is not affiliated with the similarly 
named us company 
at the companys general meeting anderson said the majority of 
the writeoffs will have no immediate cashflow implications 
we will diligently pursue recovery of past losses arising from 
the alleged isc fraud through appropriate legal processes he 
said 
ferranti has filed suit against four former isc executives 
seeking 1985 million the british company alleges were illegally 
siphoned off it has also filed suit in britains high court 
against its former auditors kpmg peat marwick mclintock for 
negligence 
anderson who replaced sir derek alunjones in february in an 
attempt to turn the company around said ferrantis performance 
over the past few years has not been satisfactory 
he told shareholders that a thorough strategic review was 
under way 
anderson said the companys board was reviewing stock values 
reassessing profits or losses and making adequate provisions for

emerson electric co pleaded guilty tuesday to 
making inflated cost estimates for electronic equipment it sold the 
pentagon and agreed to pay 14 million in fines and penalties 
the company pleaded guilty in federal court to four felony 
counts of filing false statements us attorney thomas dittmeier 
said 
the company admitted that between 1983 and 1987 it gave false 
and inflated cost estimates for equipment it sold the defense 
department as a solesource contractor 
as a result of inflated estimates the government was 
overcharged for equipment it bought from emerson dittmeier said 
emersons plant located in suburban ferguson was raided by 
federal agents in february 1988 emerson said it was told the 
action was related to the alleged use of parts for us military 
vehicles on equipment that it was selling to egypt 
emerson had contended following the raid that it transferred 
equipment to vehicles it was assembling for egypt under a borrow 
and pay back agreement with the government the claim however 
was disputed by prosecutors 
dittmeier said emersons plea agreement called for the payment 
of double damages for overcharges rather than the triple damages 
that normally would have been assessed 
under an agreement emerson subsidiary electronics amp space corp 
will pay 40000 in fines in addition to the 14 million settlement 
the false statements were on four military contracts for 
automatic test equipment 
dittmeier said no emerson officials were penalized individually 
because of what appears to be a very institutionalized way of 
doing business 
he said the settlement lets the public know that we did the 
right thing and lets the defense industry know that were looking 
at them 
the guilty plea caps a grand jury investigation of fraud 
allegations against emerson which makes electronic components for 
several weapon systems 
emerson entered its plea before us district judge john f 
nangle who ordered the company to pay the 14 million within five 
days to the justice department 
the probe was conducted by the us attorneys office in st 
louis the defense criminal investigative service the defense 
contract audit agency and the defense logistics agency 
the justice department also said it found evidence that emerson 
charged the government for parts it used on other contracts but 
that this activity was not covered by the plea 
under the agreement emerson is required to submit accurate 
complete and current cost and pricing data and its best estimates 
of future costs in order to enable the government to negotiate fair 
and reasonable prices

accelerate and that the federal reserve would in turn push 
interest rates higher 
bond prices which had been up in early trading surrendered 
their gains in response to the purchasing managers report and the 
stock market initially followed suit

the food and drug administration on tuesday 
approved irradiation of poultry to control salmonella and other 
bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses but the industry said it 
had no plans to use the procedure 
the fda said irradiation is safe and effective in eliminating 
most bacteria in chicken turkey and other fresh and frozen birds 
making poultry safe for longer periods under refrigeration 
poultry companies however said they do not plan to use the 
technology because of consumer opposition and because the 
consumer can achieve the same thing by cooking the chicken said 
stephen pretanik science director at the national broiler council 
which represents the commercial broiler chicken industry 
there does not appear to be wide consumer acceptance for any 
food irradiation he said 
although cooking chicken thoroughly kills illnesscausing 
bacteria a lot of the sickness coming from chicken is coming 
from crosscontamination when raw poultry comes in contact with 
other food said george pauli consumer safety officer at fda 
irradiation of food was first approved in 1963 when the fda 
allowed its use to control insects in wheat and wheat flour later 
the fda approved its use to control insects spoilage and parasites 
in other grains fruits vegetables spices and pork 
irradiation of poultry is the first approved use aimed at 
controlling bacteria in food that cause illness in humans 
so far the process has been used infrequently because of 
consumer opposition food industry officials said when foods are 
irradiated they must be labeled that have been treated that way 
the fda on tuesday emphasized that the process does not make 
the food radioactive and as a result does not expose consumers to 
radiation 
but michael colby director of food and water inc a group that 
researches food safety and environmental issues said the fdas 
action was an outrage to consumers and to anyone who cares about 
safe food products 
he said scientific evidence that irradiation is safe is lacking 
and that by approving irradiation the fda is allowing poultry 
growers and processors to speed up their operations without having 
to clean up their facilities 
the problem with salmonella comes from the condition of 
poultry facilities and theyre filthy colby said the fda is 
proposing a toxic solution to a toxic problem 
colby also said the states of new york new jersey and maine 
prohibit the sale of irradiated foods 
in its approval the fda limited the amount of radiation that 
can be used on poultry to 3 kilogray doses of 1 to 10 kilogray are 
considered medium levels of radiation 
approval of irradiation for poultry was sought by the us 
department of agriculture which is responsible for inspecting meat 
and poultry products and radiation technology inc of rockaway 
nj a firm providing radiation treatment 
from 1973 to 1987 poultry accounted for 96 percent of the 
foodborne illnesses in outbreaks for which a food source was 
reported the fda said 
officials said there were no estimates on the incidence of 
foodborne illnesses in the united states but some estimate that 
nearly everyone gets sick from food every couple of years these 
illnesses range in severity from a stomach ache to death 
radiation could be used to control such bacteria as salmonella 
yersinia and campylobacter which are common in poultry and can 
cause gastrointestinal illnesses contamination can occur through 
other foods or when the poultry is not cooked thoroughly 
the fda said it based its approval on studies in which 
laboratory animals were fed diets containing irradiated poultry 
the study found the treatment to be effective and the treated foods 
to be safe

soybean futures prices fell moderately tuesday on the chicago 
board of trade after a sudden reversal in a technically inspired 
rally that had driven prices to new ninemonth highs 
grain futures followed the soybean market and ended mostly lower 
on other commodity markets energy futures rose sharply copper 
futures surged precious metals advanced and livestock and meat 
futures were mixed 
soybean futures settled 4 cents to 6 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may down 5 cents at 627 a bushel 
wheat futures settled 6 cents lower to 2 cents higher with may 
at 367 a bushel corn was 2 cents lower to 2 cents higher with 
may at 283 a bushel oats were cent lower to cent higher 
with may at 164 a bushel 
soybeans for may delivery touched 655 a bushel the highest 
price for a nearmonth soybean contract since july 28 before the 
rally ran out of steam 
analysts linked the early runup to chart patterns that indicated 
to many traders that prices were likely to continue their recent 
strong advance 
the upswing in prices that began about two weeks ago was 
underpinned by strong demand and relatively tight supplies but 
those factors had been known for long enough that analysts 
discounted them as a reason for tuesdays action 
prices peaked before noon then fell amid heavy selling that 
accelerated in the final hour of trading 
the buying dried up the selling picked up and the lower you 
got the more selling you ran into said jerry zusel manager of 
balfour maclaine corps grain trading operations 
the unusual volatility may have been a function of thin market 
conditions due to the may day holiday in europe with european 
markets closed there were fewer players in the soybean market and 
prices fluctuated more freely 
oil futures rose on the new york mercantile exchange largely on 
speculation that opec ministers meeting wednesday in geneva will 
agree on measures to firm up crudeoil prices 
as cartel ministers arrived tuesday for the emergency meeting 
opec president sadek boussena of algeria said opec needs cut to oil 
production by as much as 15 million barrels a day to help crude 
prices recover from their recent slide 
crude oil values have fallen more than 20 percent since january 
us supplies of crude oil and refined products fell last week 
according to the weekly american petroleum institute stocks report 
released after the close of trading 
the trade group reported a relatively modest decline of 473000 
barrels of crude oil and steeper drops of 15 million barrels of 
gasoline and 21 million barrels of petroleum distillates 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 13 cents to 27 cents 
higher with june at 1881 a barrel heating oil was 103 cents to 
152 cents higher with june at 5297 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 85 cent to 119 cents higher with june at 6103 cents 
a gallon 
copper futures rose sharply on new yorks commodity exchange 
reflecting continuing concerns about tight supplies copper settled 
29 cents to 52 cents higher with may at 1221 a pound 
gold futures rose moderately nearly erasing mondays losses 
while silver and platinum futures posted strong gains 
on the commodity exchange gold futures settled 130 to 160 
higher with may at 370 a troy ounce silver was 8 cents to 84 
cents higher with may at 5013 a troy ounce 
platinum futures ended 560 to 590 higher on the new york 
merc with july at 47970 a troy ounce 
cattle futures were mixed on the chicago mercantile exchange 
pork futures rose sharply reflecting strong cash markets and 
bullish technical signals in the pork bellies which climbed the 
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound for the second straight 
day 
live cattle settled 30 cent lower to 27 cent higher with june 
at 7322 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent lower to 42 
cent higher with may at 8255 cents a pound live hogs were 10

dallas and houston were the top two 
cities for corporate relocations in 1989 as cheaper costs made the 
southwest a hot spot to move companies according to market 
research by a top relocation firm 
according to a study of 37000 corporate moves handled by phh 
homequity chicago slipped to fifth place from third and new york 
to fourth from second last year new york lost the most families to 
other cities the company said 
one of the things is the cost of doing business there for 
different types of industry theyll find that moving to dallas 
will be better for them it just makes sense said keith bisogno 
a spokesman for phh homequity 
he said the average appraised value of house home in new york 
was 295513 compared to 142590 in dallas 117057 in houston 
and 116379 in denver 
jc penney co inc moved 1200 employees to dallas from new 
york in 1988 while exxon corp announced last year it was moving 
200 to 300 people to dallas both cited costs as a factor 
basically it was a variety of reasons the nearness of a major 
international airport the favorable business climate in dallas 
and the various amenities in terms of lifestyle cost of housing 
and such exxon spokesman bill smith said 
were saving about 60 million a year in administrative 
costs jc penney spokesman duncan muir said we owned the 
building in new york but just occupancy costs and labor costs

a federal judge on tuesday allowed 
torchmark inc to continue a proxy fight aimed at gaining control 
of its bigger insurance rival american general corp 
us district judge thomas a wiseman said a tennessee state 
commissioner overreached his authority when he ordered an end to 
the proxy battle monday the state immediately appealed the ruling 
to the 6th us circuit court of appeals in cincinnati 
the judge said the order by revenue commissioner joe huddleston 
interfered with the rights of stockholders to vote their shares at 
houstonbased american generals annual meeting wednesday 
regulating insurance companies is one thing regulating how 
people vote their stock is quite another wiseman said in the 
ruling 
representatives of torchmark based in birmingham ala also 
said an indiana superior court judge rl milan had delayed an 
administrative hearing on the proxy battle in that state until next 
monday 
huddleston said torchmark violated state law by soliciting a 
majority of proxies designed to elect five new members of the 
15member american general board of directors 
torchmark attorney william leech said torchmark wants five 
directors on the board who will listen to discussions about merging 
the two companies he said election of onethird of the directors 
falls short of a takeover 
tennessee is one of 10 states in which american general is 
considered domiciled because of operations there regulators in 
texas and new york as well as tennessee have questioned the 
legality of torchmarks proxy solicitation missouri california 
and virginia have approved the process 
american general has assets of 32 billion torchmark with 
assets of 5 billion has set aside 15 million for the proxy fight 
testimony during the hearing showed the proxy strategy was 
adopted after american general directors rejected torchmarks offer 
of 50 in cash and 50 in torchmark stock for each share of 
american general stock 
huddleston was designated to hear the case for state commerce 
commissioner elaine mcreynolds who recused herself because she is 
a former assistant vice president of american general life amp 
accident insurance co a subsidiary with 1500 employees in 
nashville 
huddleston said state insurance law said no company or holding 
company can seek to control a tennessee company without prior 
approval of the state department of commerce and insurance

the us ambassador to japan asserted tuesday 
that japanese consumers will be among the main beneficiaries of 
easing barriers against american goods 
michael armacost also said progress has been made toward 
lowering japanese trade restrictions but the united states should 
continue to firmly press our requests on trade issues 
weve covered a fair amount of business in the past six or 
seven weeks armacost told a news conference its been 
satisfying to get some of these issues laid to rest 
armacost a career diplomat who was named ambassador a year ago 
was in seattle to speak to a japanamerica society meeting 
he said a developing consumerism movement in japan has resulted 
in more unhappiness at trade practices that keep prices of imported 
goods in japan artificially high 
theres a growing realization that these reforms are good for 
them he said 
lowering tariffs on wood products for instance raises the 
possibility that japanese could buy better housing armacost said 
there are enough benefits to be shared he said this should 
not be regarded as a oneway concession 
president bush last friday declined to cite japan under a 
section of us trade law that provides for economic retaliation if 
offensive trade barriers are not removed 
administration officials said targeting japan could provoke a 
public backlash against the united states and make it far more 
difficult for prime minister toshiki kaifu to reform japans 
trading system 
bushs decision was denounced by many members of congress who 
said the united states 49 billion trade imbalance with japan is 
bleeding american jobs and capital 
the bush administration last year cited japan under the 
socalled super 301 provision of the trade laws for barriers to 
usmade supercomputers satellites and wood products 
but in the past month us and japanese negotiators have 
reached agreements toward opening markets in all three of those 
areas 
the wood products agreement has been criticized by many 
northwest lawmakers and by small mill operators in the region as 
not going far enough but us trade representative carla hills 
said the agreement should boost us wood products sales by 1 
billion in 1991 
armacost said the agreements on computers satellites and wood 
products undoubtedly were hastened by a deadline for action set by 
the bush administration 
but he said the accords are a gesture of good faith from the 
japanese government that they are willing to resolve trade 
issues it would be inappropriate to impose super 301 now he 
said

thousands of germans demanded protection 
against unemployment tuesday and labor leaders warned that western 
businesses are eager to exploit east germanys lowpaid work force 
in the west german capital bonn negotiators from both germanys 
met in an effort to complete by friday a plan for merging the 
economies and social institutions of the two nations 
an estimated 600000 workers held 700 rallies in both nations 
during may day gatherings tuesday 
in west berlin bands of mostly leftist radicals hurled 
firebombs and rocks tuesday night and police responded with tear 
gas and nightsticks more than 50 people were arrested after 
darkness fell in the tense kreuzberg district of the city west 
berlin police reported there were no immediate reports of injuries 
in the east german city of leipzig a group of leftist youths 
brawled with a band of neonazi youths in the market square the 
government news agency adn reported 
three suffered minor injuries and 21 were arrested the agency 
said 
authorities have feared that the newly opened borders between 
east and west germany would result in clashes that wold spread into 
east berlin as of late tuesday there were no reports of violence 
in east berlin 
in an earlier west berlin rally attended by 60000 bannerwaving 
east and west germans speakers voiced the fears that unification 
could bring high unemployment and an erosion of workers rights 
ernst breit head of west germanys federation of trade unions 
said some west german businesses and politicians view east germany 
as a new lowwage land with possibly less social security fewer 
controls and weak unions 
one east german listener 19yearold maria hoensch asked 
what sort of future will i have nobody knows what will happen 
economists have predicted that 500000 to 2 million east germans 
could lose their jobs in the next two years as inefficient 
stateowned enterprises are closed and others are forced to compete 
with western businesses 
government officials in both germanys say the effects will be 
temporary as western businesses flood into the east creating jobs 
and raising living standards 
the two germanys expect to complete agreement this week on the 
terms of an economic and social union that will go into effect on 
july 2 
differences remain between the governments on how much financial 
protection west germany will give east germans during the 
unification process 
officials from both countries met again in bonn to discuss the 
issues and planned to hold more meetings thursday and friday in 
east berlin 
both sides say they hope to have a final plan finished by friday 
for absorbing east germanys economy public sector and social 
welfare system 
the negotiators want the plan ready before east germans vote in 
their first free local and state election sunday voters had their 
first democratic national elections on march 18 
west germans fear higher taxes inflation and competition for 
jobs may be the cost of bailing out east germanys decimated 
economy 
west german chancellor helmut kohl who faces reelection in 
december denied that taxes would be raised and dismissed fears 
that inflation would result from replacing the nearly worthless 
east german mark for the powerful west german currency 
in an article to be published wednesday in the west german 
newspaper die welt kohl said the west german mark will remain 
the most stable and desirable currency in the world 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere wants some job 
housing and social subsidies retained at least temporarily to help 
ease his nations transition from four decades of heavily 
subsidized socialism 
west german officials have agreed to exchange most east german 
marks at a 11 rate for west german marks when the western currency 
is circulated in the country in july 
the west german proposal calls for a 21 exchange for personal 
savings of more than 2300 but east germany is demanding a higher 
ceiling

a us plan to cut worldwide subsidies to 
farmers deals only with subsidies for exports and not with costly 
domestic price supports french agriculture minister henri nallet 
complained 
the 12 nations of the european community want to negotiate on 
all kinds of support to farmers nallet said tuesday 
subsidies on farm products cost taxpayers and consumers tens of 
billions of dollars a year not only in the united states and europe 
but in many other countries governments generally agree they 
should be reduced but the ec rejects the us goal of eliminating 
them completely 
nearly 100 governments taking part in the uruguay round of 
trade talks are trying to get agreements by the end of the year on 
many kinds of trade subsidizing farmers is a key issue 
i dont think that even in 10 or 20 years or even when were 
all dead that well be able to come to the point where theres no 
assistance given to farmers whatsoever nallet told reporters 
after a day of talks with us leaders 
he said us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter showed him an 
interesting plan for what is called tariffication under it 
many kinds of subsidies and other barriers to trade would be 
converted into a single barrier customs duties on imported farm 
products 
once governments agreed on such a conversion it would be 
simpler to reduce the barriers 
we can agree on tariffication as long as all subsidies are 
included nallet said the american plan would deal only with 
export subsidies not with domestic price supports 
he praised the work of the organization for economic and 
cooperation and development which groups the governments of the 
major industrial countries in calculating the value of their farm 
subsidies it showed new zealand giving the lowest subsidies 
amounting to only about 10 percent of its products value 
australias subsidies are only a little greater he said 
subsidies given by other major countries go from 27 percent by 
the united states to about 70 percent for japan the rate for the 
ec which has a joint farm policy was put at 38 percent 
every government gives subsidies nallet said were all 
in the same boat 
he said he had found in washington a new readiness to talk 
realistically and to put all the elements on the negotiating table 
agreement is within our grasp he added im against 
people who keep saying how difficult it all is
