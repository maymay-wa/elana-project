president bush is turning up pressure on 
congress to quickly enact his aid request for panama and nicaragua 
as the houseapproved measure faces delay in the senate 
the house voted 36259 tuesday for a 24 billion spending bill 
that provides 720 million for the two new central american 
democracies the measure includes nearly 17 billion in other 
spending most of it for domestic programs such as disaster relief 
food stamps and forest service firefighting 
the bill is partly funded by a 18 billion cut from the 
pentagon budget that amounts to the first use of a peace 
dividend from lessened eastwest military tensions 
bush called his appeal a laserlike request to help panama and 
nicaragua and state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said failure to pass the package quickly would threaten the 
fledgling democracies and be like playing with dynamite 
but while the senate prepares to consider a companion bill 
authorizing aid programs for the two countries it seems in no rush 
to take up the money bill itself 
we have a problem lighting a fire under the senate to move the 
bill said a senior administration official speaking on 
condition of anonymity there is an alarming lack of enthusiasm 
to get this through the senate 
an aide to sen robert c byrd dwva chairman of the senate 
appropriations committee said the senator believes the 
administration is sending too much money to panama and nicaragua 
and not enough to emerging democracies in eastern europe 
that means bushs thursday deadline for passage of the money 
bill apparently will not be met and that the measure will be 
before the senate when congress returns from its 12day easter 
recess later this month 
the administration sent its ambassador to panama deane hinton 
before the senate foreign relations committee on tuesday to argue 
for the urgency of aid 
that money is desperately needed and needed now hinton 
said he said panamas government is bankrupt and dealing with 30 
percent unemployment and that the public has high expectations 
following decembers us invasion that ousted dictator manuel 
antonio noriega 
investors lack confidence until they see what the united 
states is going to do hinton said 
in nicaragua presidentelect violeta chamorro will take office 
april 25 faced by a litany of immediate problems ms tutwiler said 
she will inherit an economy that is bankrupt and a country 
that will run out of oil as early as july hundreds of thousands of 
nicaraguans will be returning to their country former contras and 
their families demobilized soldiers and refugees from 10 years of 
war the state department spokeswoman said 
congress must decide whether these nicaraguans will return as 
an army of the unemployed unable to feed or support their 
families or as citizens of a democracy in which jobs and 
opportunities are available she said 
in the house the supplemental money bill for the balance of 
fiscal 1990 easily survived attempts to strike out or trim foreign 
aid sections but the attempts drew derision from the bills 
supporters 
i am amazed at the number of flatheaded members in this house 
who are all too happy to spend whatever it takes to support wars 
but wouldnt spend a penny to prevent the necessity to fight 
those wars in the first place said rep david obey dwis 
rep james traficant dohio sought to cut 5 percent from the 
foreign aid portions of the bill charging the measure was 
busting the bank before we ship money overseas lets take 
care of our own country first 
rep mickey edwards rokla countered this amendment shows 
why people are fed up with congress because were looking at the 
little bitty did i get mine instead of taking care of the 
security of our people 
the house bill includes bushs full 300 million request for 
nicaragua but it trims 80 million from the 500 million he sought 
for panama diverting 30 million of that to aid african countries 
20 million to caribbean nations and 30 million to refugee 
programs

the debate over tougher air pollution controls 
shifts to the house with senate approval of a sweeping clean air 
bill imposing new emission curbs on automobiles factories and 
electric power plants 
the senate voted 8911 late tuesday to approve a farreaching 
bill aimed at reducing urban smog toxic industrial chemical 
releases and acid rain pollution 
the house energy and commerce committee was working behind 
closed doors today on the house version of the bill a final 
committee vote is expected by the end of the week 
president bush called the senate action a historic vote that 
will affect generations to come as we work to build a cleaner 
safer america the last time either the senate or house approved 
changes in federal clean air laws was 1977 despite growing concern 
in recent years about dirty air 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine who 
unsuccessfully sought over the past decade to change federal clean 
air laws called the senate bill a tremendous victory and a 
significant improvement over current air pollution requirements 
we can no longer delay the american people want action they 
demand action mitchell said 
the lopsided senate voted capped weeks of jockeying among 
senators over the legislation which was a compromise with the 
white house 
senators from the northeast and california sought to toughen 
auto pollution controls but failed in narrow votes several 
attempts to cushion the midwest from the high cost of acid rain 
controls also failed as did an effort to help coal miners who 
could lose their jobs under new pollution requirements 
many senators expressed concern over the bills cost estimated 
at about 21 billion a year when it takes full effect toward the 
end of the decade 
mitchell acknowledged the new emission controls would be 
expensive to industry but he argued the costs of inaction will 
be higher than the cost of this bill 
health experts estimate air pollution may account for 50000 
premature deaths every year and add 40 billion a year to health 
care costs he said 
but to many senators particularly from the midwest the vote 
represented an agonizing choice between cleaner air and concern 
about the measures impact on employment and electric bills back 
home 
this bill will absolutely decimate my state of illinois 
declared democratic sen alan dixon whose state has utility plants 
that rely on highsulfur coal as well as miners whose jobs would be 
jeopardized by new measures to combat acid rain 
dixon was among the 11 senators who voted against the 
legislation four were from states that would be hard hit by 
stringent acid rain control provisions 
i cannot vote for legislation that will destroy the livelihood 
of thousands of hardworking men and women that will bring 
economic ruin to communities throughout appalachian and midwestern 
states said sen robert byrd dwva who unsuccessfully sought 
financial help for coal miners affected by the bill 
among key provisions of the bill are 
tighter automobile tailpipe emission controls requiring that 
new cars run cleaner and reduce smogcausing pollutants cleaner 
fuels would be required for fleets and automobiles in most polluted 
cities as well as for urban transit buses 
a reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions from coalburning 
utility plants by 10 million tons a year curbing acid rain 
reductions through the installation of the best available 
control technology of toxic chemical releases by industry 
including controls on about 200 chemicals linked to cancer nervous 
disorders and birth defects 
the bill would require states to implement specific pollution 
control plans to clean up urban smog and establish requirements to 
cut pollution by 3 percent a year until federal air quality 
standards are achieved 
the timetable for cleaning the air of urban smog ranges from 
five years to 15 years for most of the nations cities because of 
the severity of its problem los angeles is given 20 years 
supporters of the legislation noted government figures that 150 
million people breathe dirty air in more than 100 cities from 
lewiston maine to los angeles 
industrial plants release an estimated 27 billion pounds of 
toxic chemicals including carcinogens into the air each year and 
acid rain pollutants are endangering streams and lakes across much 
of the northeast and midatlantic states

the agriculture department is launching a 
quackdown on duck growers who call their birds long island 
ducklings even when theyre raised as far away as wisconsin or 
pennsylvania 
the action comes after a fivemonth investigation into alleged 
mislabeling of ducks it was prompted by a complaint from rep 
george hochbrueckner dny whose eastern long island district 
includes some of the regions last duck farms 
were not looking for anything other than fairness doug 
corwin a fourthgeneration duck farmer said tuesday from 
aquebogue ny 
im objecting to the bogus address which gives the 
restaurateur or the consumer the misconception hes getting a long 
island product which in fact he isnt 
on march 21 the agriculture department sent letters to five 
duck processors telling them it found their labels false or 
misleading said jim greene a spokesman for the departments food 
safety and inspection service 
department investigators doing what greene called basic gumshoe 
work found that some duck farmers only connection to long island 
was a post office box yet their products carried such labels as 
pride of long islands south shore or genuine long island 
distributed duckling 
the issue is simply that in order for it to be labeled long 
island duck or duckling the animal has to have been raised or 
slaughtered on long island greene said 
he identified the five as concord farms inc of concord nc 
joe jurgielewicz amp sons ltd of shartlesville pa culver corp of 
middlebury ind maple leaf farms inc of milford ind and maple 
leaf duck farm inc of franksville wis 
the five have 60 days to respond to the agriculture department 
then if the ruling becomes final and they continue to put long 
island labels on their ducks the agriculture inspector at the 
plant wont let the birds off the premises greene said 
barbara bender marketing director for concord farms said 
long island duck is merely a marketing phrase 
its not a breed its a place she said 
even when they sell restaurants north carolina duck the 
restaurants still list it on the menu as long island duckling she 
added 
but on long island corwin said the mislabeling has cut into his 
market particularly in places like florida and texas 
our problem comes in markets where we are not wellknown he 
said say if we were asked for a bid we could not outbid a plant 
in the midwest that had lower costs and yet the bids would specify 
genuine long island products 
those outofstate farmers also are trading on long islands 
reputation for raising leaner meatier ducks said joe gergela of 
the long island farm bureau 
long island produces about 2 million ducks a year down from 
about 5 million to 6 million 30 years ago corwin said production 
has declined steadily over the years as land development high 
taxes and escalating utility costs squeezed out farmers 
at one time long island had nearly 100 duck farms now there 
are about a halfdozen 
corwin whose greatgrandfather began raising ducks in 1908 
produces about half the islands annual total 
id like to keep growing ducks out here for a few 
generations he said

angered by a new book picturing lyndon b 
johnson as a selfcentered politician obsessed with power admirers 
of the 36th president are gathering here this week to celebrate his 
large and generous vision of america 
the occasion is a reunion recalling the 25th anniversary of 
johnsons inauguration as an elected president on jan 20 1965 
on tuesday a new 30minute documentary filmlyndon baines 
johnson a remembrance was previewed at the motion picture 
association of america theater 
produced by academy awardwinning documentary maker charles 
guggenheim of washington the film presents an image of johnson 
hardly recognizable to readers of means of ascent the second 
volume of robert caros lbj biography 
the book portrays johnson in his youth as willing to do almost 
anything to satisfy an allconsuming political ambition caro has 
said a subsequent volume will show more positive qualities that 
johnson displayed as senator and president 
the film made up of black and white still photographs and the 
voices of former johnson associates concentrates on johnsons 
labors on behalf of civil rights legislation and touches briefly on 
the troubles that the war in vietnam brought to his administration 
it ends with journalist bill moyers who was one of johnsons 
press secretaries saying he was many things proud sensitive 
impulsive flamboyant sentimental earthy mean at times bold 
euphoric insecure magnanimous but temperamental melancholy and 
strangely ill at ease he has such a large and generous vision of 
america in his best moments as a prosperous caring just society 
this was a mind not given to rest and neither i think he would 
say should we 
on friday organizers say approximately 1000 former white house 
staffers ambassadors telephone operators and others from the 
johnson white house will gather for a social event to launch a 
book lbj the white house years by harry j middleton 
director of the johnson presidential library with photographs by 
the late white house photographer yoichi okamoto 
i find it far more skillful and i think useful than mr 
caros said jack valenti president of the motion picture 
association of america and a former johnson aide 
joseph califano a johnson aide who later became secretary of 
health education and welfare in the carter administration asked 
to comment on caros book said of johnson was he a tough 
politician sure he was could he be a bareknuckles fighter sure 
were no holds barred absolutely but what is totally missing from 
caros book is any sense of what drove the man of the vision that 
he had 
the observance is scheduled to wind up saturday with panels of 
journalists discussing in search of lbj under auspices of the 
national press foundation and the lbj foundation and former 
johnson administration officials discussing social welfare issues 
from the 1960s to the 1990s

seminar at the lbj ranch near johnson city texas

in some agriculture department circles the 
buzz words these days are africanized honeybees 
not killer bees mind you thats all beeswax dreamed up by 
hollywood and the news media the usda has a new backgrounder 
report to straighten things out 
africanized honeybees from mexico are expected to arrive in 
texas sometime during 199192 by natural spread although some 
swarms may arrive sooner the report said 
the early arrivals could be occasional swarms coming from south 
and central america aboard ships those are a concern but they 
are not major threats to americans or the us beekeeping 
industry it said 
some domestic beekeepers are fearful that the spread of 
africanized bees could jeopardize the us industry which includes 
commercial crop pollination services as well as honey production 
it has been a long trail for the africanized honeybees 
descendants of 26 african swarms imported by researchers in brazil 
in 1956 who were trying to develop more productive models than the 
traditional european honeybee 
as the africanized swarms multiplied and spread into neighboring 
south american countries they also marched north across the 
continent gaining an evil reputation by the early 1980s they were 
in panama and it was obvious their march would take them into 
mexico and into the united states 
researchers named them africanized honeybees the report 
said however as a result of widely publicized stinging 
incidents the name killer bee was picked up by the movie 
industry and the media to describe the africanized honeybee 
the report said everyday risks such as auto accidents pose a 
much greater risk statistically than death from beestings 
according to routes indicated by the report the bees are 
expected to make their us entry near the southernmost tip of 
texas 
the africanized bee is more dangerous than its larger european 
cousin which incidentally was introduced into north america by 
european settlers or maybe it isnt it depends how many are 
involved 
unlike the docile european honeybees common in the united 
states the africanized honeybee quickly defends its hive and will 
pursue intruders longer distances the report said the venom 
from one africanized honeybee sting is no more potent than the 
venom of a single european honeybee sting 
one of the widely reported characteristics of the africanized 
bees is their defensive behavior in which hundreds or thousands 
quickly and aggressively respond to an intruder each carrying a 
potential sting to the victim 
even though mass stinging attacks are terrifying and could be 
lifethreatening they are not common the report said the 
best defense for avoiding stings from all stinging insects not 
just honeybees is common sense 
the report added if you find yourself near large numbers of 
honeybees calmly and quickly move away from the area

two steel companies paid employees expenses 
to travel here against their unions wishes to rally against a 
cleanair bill that the industry opposes according to company and 
union officials 
the united steelworkers of america which supports the bill 
used memos and telephone calls to try to hold down the size of 
tuesdays demonstration members of a steelworkers local in 
pennsylvania decided not to come because the union leadership 
advised against it 
still the demonstration on the capitol steps was attended by 
about 150 workers many from usx corps steelmaking plants in 
gary ind and fairless hills pa and the companys ore facility 
at mountain iron minn 
usx paid the expenses of its workers who attended said 
spokesman ernie glenn 
ltv corp also sponsored some of its steelworkers from cleveland 
and warren ohio so they could come according to spokesman chuck 
hess 
we look at this as sponsoring a rally for employees who have 
expressed concern about this legislation and what it might mean for 
them and their families glenn said im not going to comment 
on what the international the union says or does 
when he heard about the rally at the end of last week 
steelworkers president lynn williams sent a memorandum to union 
directors nationwide 
the steel companies are attempting to take advantage of our 
basic steel local unions by planning an allexpenses companypaid 
rally in washington the memo said it is not a rally which the 
united steelworkers of america supports the steel companies are 
not themselves opposing the act but are using our members to front 
for them 
charlie grese president of the union local at the usx plant in 
clairton pa said in a telephone interview that he changed his 
mind about attending after speaking to williams and other union 
officials on the phone 
theres no question we were about ready to come down grese 
said i told the company i would have to take this past the 
international union and would not come down without authorization 
from the international president 
grese said he decided not to go after being told by the unions 
chief lobbyist that the rally would do little good because it was 
too late to change any minds the senate approved the bill 
8911 tuesday night 
demonstrators at the rally opposed a requirement in the bill 
that people living near steel plant coke ovens could not be exposed 
to a cancer risk of more than one in 10000 over 70 years 
the demonstrators expressed concern that such a guideline was 
unrealistic and could force the mandatory shutdown of dozens of 
coke ovens coke which comes from coal is a raw material of 
steel coke ovens can emit benzene a carcinogen 
billy gray a coke oven worker at the gary plant said concern 
about shutting down coke ovens led him to attend the rally even 
though he knew the union leadership backed the legislation its 
a big union a democratic union he said 
while the major steel companies oppose the bill the union says 
the measure provides enough time and leeway for steelmakers to 
avoid hardships 
under the bill steel producers that make extraordinary efforts 
to control leakage from coke ovens would be given until 2020 before 
noncomplying ovens would be closed 
the union believes the industry duped workers in a crude 
campaign of deception by making it seem there is a possibility of 
immediate job loss from the bill said union spokesman gary 
hubbard

the jury in john poindexters irancontra 
trial is being sequestered until it reaches a verdict after two 
members told the judge they were contacted by the news media 
the panel of eight women and four men was returning to the us 
courthouse today to consider the criminal charges against the 
former national security adviser 
members spent tuesday night in a hotel after us district court 
judge harold greene ordered them sequestered 
it was disclosed in court tuesday that washington post reporter 
nora boustany had telephoned juror leroy witherspoon at home after 
mondays first day of deliberations witherspoon said he hung up on 
her twice 
juror william harris said he was contacted monday evening by a 
woman identifying herself as a reporter he hung up and she didnt 
call back 
greene said the irresponsible behavior of the press leaves me 
no alternative but to have the jurors taken by the marshals 
to a hotel each night 
i certainly dont want to have a mistrial greene said 
both jurors will remain on the panel because they were alert 
and intelligent and didnt allow any conversation about the case 
to take place said greene poindexter lawyer richard beckler said 
he had no objection to the two jurors staying on the panel 
washington post editors instructed boustany to find out how to 
get in touch with witherspoon after the verdict said robert 
kaiser the posts assistant managing editor for national news 
she did this by calling him up to ask him said kaiser 
adding that she had made a mistake 
the judge said the posts explanation was that the reporter 
just came from lebanon and didnt know the rules 
kaiser said the second juror was not contacted by a post 
reporter 
also on tuesday greene denied jurors request for copies of 
5000 messages which were deleted from poindexters computer system 
days before he resigned the messages were preserved on a backup 
computer tape and some of them have been admitted as evidence 
many however remain highly classified and were not introduced at 
the trial 
the deletion of the computer messages is specified in the 
indictment as part of poindexters alleged effort to obstruct 
congress on the iran initiative poindexters lawyers say it was 
routine for departing national security council employees to purge 
their computer systems 
poindexter who was national security adviser to thenpresident 
reagan from late 1985 to november 1986 is charged with conspiring 
to obstruct congress two counts of making false statements to 
lawmakers and two counts of obstructing congressional inquiries 
into the irancontra affair 
he is accused of covering up oliver norths secret contra 
resupply operation and the us role in a november 1985 shipment of 
hawk missiles to iran

education secretary lauro cavazos says hes 
convinced that some house democrats are playing politics with the 
presidents bill to improve us schools 
the bottom line is simple some people just have a difficult 
time giving the president any credit for the efforts and leadership 
he has taken in improving and restructuring our nations schools 
said cavazos 
he chastised the house education and labor committee for not 
advancing the administrations 15 billion bill to upgrade 
education an alternative offered by chairman augustus hawkins 
dcalif is a ploy to sidetrack the presidents bill cavazos 
said 
i am disappointed that the administration legislation has 
been treated in a highly partisan fashion cavazos told the 
subcommittee on elementary secondary and vocational education 
it is not a partisan bill it is an education reform bill 
however many education leaders testified in favor of hawkins 
bill including keith geiger president of the national education 
association franklin smith of the council of the great city 
schools and gordon ambach director of the council of chief state 
school officers 
the subcommittee however became embroiled in a partisan war of 
words 
rep william f goodling rpa who introduced the 
administrations bill with 98 cosponsors complained that the 
democrats bill was 177 pages thrown together in two weeks with 
not much thought and very few details on how various sections 
would be implemented 
rep william d ford dmich took exception to cavazos claim 
of partisanship and accused him of schizophrenic rhetoric that 
praises bush for his educational programs while criticizing the 
democrats for theirs he also said the president is seeking a 2 
percent cut in the education budget 
rep harris fawell rill estimated that the democrats 
version would cost 50 billion in five years and said nobody in 
the budget committee could begin to take it seriously 
the senate in early february voted 928 to approve and send to 
the house the excellence in education act initially submitted by 
bush last spring 
the bill seeks to combat drugs in public schools establish a 
presidential merit schools program and increase aid to schools 
seeking to reduce dropout rates one controversial section would 
award 25 million in federal funds over three years to the recently 
established national board for professional teaching standards 
hawkins bill would increase by 1 billion the authorized amount 
for head start for fiscal 1991 fully fund the special supplemental 
food program for women infants and children by 1994 and expand the 
even start program it also would increase aid for dropout 
prevention deterring drug abuse and assisting the handicapped 
illiterate and disadvantaged 
ambach of the council of chief state school officers said 
hawkins bill includes the presidents key initiatives other 
congressional initiatives and expansion of several current 
programs in a comprehensive approach to federal action toward 
national priorities and goals for education 
smith superintendent of the dayton ohio public schools said 
hawkins bill pays particular attention to balancing the twin 
concerns of excellence and equity issues that are of vital 
interest to urban schools and the children they must serve 
but lawrence patrick jr president of the detroit board of 
education testified that with passage of the administrations 
bill we truly believe we can become a significant point of light 
an urban star shining bright illuminating successful quality 
educational reform across the nation

the bush administration facing growing 
congressional opposition to the costly b2 stealth bomber is 
weighing plans to scale back production of the aircraft says air 
force secretary donald rice 
in his first public comments on the pentagons review of major 
weapons systems rice said the defense department is examining 
other options to the current plan to buy 132 bombers at a cost of 
more than 70 billion 
we think there are some alternate profiles with some very 
modest effect on the total cost of the program rice told the 
senate appropriations subcommittee on defense tuesday 
major concerns in the pentagon center on the possibility that 
purchasing less than the full fleet will force up the cost of a 
single radarevading bomber now estimated at about 530 million 
rice said pending legislation that would stop production at the 
15 bombers currently being built would mean a total program cost of 
33 billion to 34 billion based on those numbers a single plane 
would cost more than 2 billion he noted 
defense secretary dick cheney has been reviewing the 
alternatives rice said the air force has scheduled another 
briefing for the pentagon chief on the b2 on thursday 
president bushs 307 billion defense budget for fiscal 1991 
which begins oct 1 calls for 55 billion for the stealth bomber 
program including the purchase of five planes and other expenses 
but in the mid1990s the administration is projecting purchases 
of 10 planes and later 24 in a single year with annual costs of 
nearly 10 billion 
rice said the most efficient production rate for the planes 
manufacturer northrop corp is 29 planes a year but the air 
force secretary conceded that it will be difficult to persuade 
congress to spend almost 10 billion a year on a single weapons 
program 
pressed for the options the pentagon is weighing rice said i 
cant give numbers except to say several billion dollars a year 
less than peak funding level of close to 10 billion 
it would inevitably get up to a lower production rate on the 
order of twothirds perhaps threefourths what had been peak 
rate rice said in reference to the 29 bombers a year 
democrats and republicans on the panel made it clear that the 
b2 program for which the government has invested more than 23 
billion faces an uphill fight in congress 
sen robert kasten rwis a proponent of the stealth bomber 
questioned rice on the alternatives to the full fleet of 132 
bombers a total that many lawmakers say is unlikely 
im trying to help you guys with this weapons system kasten 
said today its hard to help 
the ranking republican on the subcommittee sen ted stevens of 
alaska wondered whether the air force had considered abandoning 
the next generation of programs such as the b2 bomber the c17 
cargo plane and the advanced tactical fighter 
stevens said several of his colleagues were thinking about 
sticking with the weapons and planes currently in use and looking 
ahead several generations to other programs 
we have a lot of backburner people on this committee 
stevens said of his colleagues who want to set aside the air 
forces hightech programs you know it and we know it

if americans are to continue paying less for 
food than anyone else in the world target prices set by the 
government for crops must be tied to production costs say five 
senators working on the pricesupport section of the 1990 farm bill 
us consumers today spend just 104 percent of their 
disposable income on food the lowest level in history and less 
than consumers in any other country sen robert kerrey dneb 
said tuesday 
but the producers share of each dollar spent on food has 
dropped to an alltime low he said at a news conference called 
to outline legislation expected to be the basis of the target price 
and income support section of the senate farm bill 
meanwhile tuesday a house subcommittee approved a dairy program 
for the house version of the massive legislation that congress 
designs every five years to set agriculture policy 
under the house dairy program the government would buy up to 7 
billion pounds of milk products at 1060 per hundred pounds if 
they cant be sold on the open market farmers who produce more 
than their share of the governments limit would get a sharply 
lower amount 
the key to the legislation is reducing butter production which 
because of low consumer demand is ending up in government 
warehouses 
the senate has not yet acted on dairy 
kerrey was joined by sens james exon dneb tom daschle 
dsd tom harkin diowa and kent conrad dnd to push for 
raising target prices on socalled program crops wheat corn 
cotton soybeans and rice 
the legislation would cost about 12 billion annually said 
kerrey who has led the fight against a bush administration 
proposal designed to lower target prices 
the government sets target prices to assure farmers a certain 
income if the market price does not reach the target price the 
government pays the farmer the difference 
the senators said their plan would protect family farms which 
an aide to daschle mark ulvensaid was important as a guard 
against higher supermarket prices if agricultural production were 
in the hands of just a few corporate farms food prices would also 
be under their control he said 
kerrey said the plans aim is not to heavily subsidize farmers 
he said the democrats are interested in seeing farmers produce for 
the market not government subsidies 
but he said recovery is fragile and the government should 
assure that farmers production costs are covered 
provisions in the proposed legislation include 
tying target prices to increased production costs 
raising loan rates which help determine market prices by more 
than 20 percent next year and setting a floor on the loan rate of 
210 for corn and 275 for wheat 
establishing a normal crop acreage base for each farm that is 
the total of the farms current cropspecific bases plus the 
average acreage planted to soybeans during the last five years 
raising income support levels on oilseeds oats and barley to 
levels comparable with wheat and corn

in the first survey of its kind homosexual 
members of the staffs of american newspapers say their papers do a 
poor job in the way they treat news about gays or of concern to 
them 
the gay journalists said their papers treat them fairly and give 
them opportunity to advance but rarely call on their insights into 
gay lifestyles in the same way black reporters are asked to help 
guide coverage of black issues 
and some newsrooms harbor a palpable undercurrent of bias a 
summary of the findings concludes one respondent commented that 
her colleagues who make snide homophobic comments and jokes are 
the same people who write those sensitive stories and 
editorials 
the survey was being made public today at the annual meeting of 
the american society of newspaper editors it was undertaken in 
response to outgoing asne president loren ghiglione who asked 
whether antigay discrimination infects todays newsrooms 
when word circulated that the survey was to be undertaken 205 
homosexual members of the staffs of us newspapers volunteered to 
respond threefifths said they were openly gay and twothirds 
signed their questionnaires 
ninetytwo percent said they knew other people on the staff who 
were gay and the majority of them estimated that fewer than 20 
percent of the homosexuals on their papers were openly gay 
many experts estimate that one american in 10 is gay 
why does it matter asked leroy f aarons an executive of 
the oakland calif tribune who coordinated the project he said 
the subject is important because more than ever before editors 
are grappling with a swirl of social and political currents around 
alternative lifestyle issues 
domestic partners legislation gay adoption 
antidiscrimination laws fundamentalist attacks on the gay 
lifestyle morality and public responsibility and of course the 
stillraging aids epidemic have brought onceeasily ignored issues 
into demanding focus he said 
the respondents gave especially low ratings to the way their 
papers treated gay lifestyles community events and politics and 
only slightly better ratings to treatment of violence against gays 
civil rights issues and legislation 
as for terminology nearly a third said they found the term 
homosexual to be prejudiced explaining that it refers narrowly 
to sex whereas the term gay refers to lifestyles or issues 
another report at the meeting looked at what happens to 
newspapers when they are taken over by nonlocal ownership a 
majority of the editors said firms owning multiple newspapers are 
more interested in profits than in the communities they serve and 
that freedom of the press is in more jeopardy when the ownership of 
papers is concentrated in fewer hands 
some editors said that group ownership was likely to enrich a 
local paper because the group brought greater resources to it some 
said group ownership led to homogenization 
editors of 234 newspapers half groupowned and half 
independent took part 
the report noted that 50 years ago there were 1559 
independent locally owned dailies and only 319 under group 
ownership but now there are only 389 independents and 1233 
groupowned papers 
groupowned papers the report said were likely to offer 
better career opportunities more sharing of ideas less pressure 
from advertisers and special interest groups greater overall 
financial resources and access to outside experts to help solve 
problems and train staff 
independent papers on the other hand were likely to offer 
larger newsroom budgets better understanding of the local 
market more flexibility in making decisions greater involvement 
in the community less turnover of key personnel few levels of 
bureaucracy and a tendency to be peculiar 
the asnes annual survey of minority employment on newspapers 
showed that 786 percent of newsroom editors reporters and 
photographers were members of racial minorities a scant increase 
from last years 754 percent 
when the survey started in 1978 blacks hispanics asians and 
american indians constituted 395 percent of the news staffs the 
figure has risen gradually each year 
in these tough economic times perhaps any increase in the 
percentage of people of color should be applauded said ghiglione 
said 
but merv aubespin chairman of the asne minorities committee 
said the slight gain was embarrassing for our industry which 
prides itself on putting the spotlight on the ills of society 
the survey said minorities make up 46 percent of newsroom 
supervisors 8 percent of copy editors 87 percent of reporters 
and 107 percent of photographers

some 15 million households nationwide 
received no census forms because the census bureau failed to print 
post office box numbers on the mailings officials said 
each form will have to be delivered by census workers to the 
homes instead of to the boxes before the census can be completed 
gail kremenec spokeswoman for the regional census office in the 
chicago suburb of westchester said tuesday 
officials were unable to estimate the cost of the foulup but 
said they dont expect any significant delay in completing the 1990 
census 
about 106 million forms were mailed nationwide in the last week 
of march but forms destined for people who have their mail sent to 
box numbers went out without the numbers and the postal service 
was unable to deliver them census officials said 
were getting them back by the mailbag its pretty widespread 
across the country rural and urban areas i think weve gotten 
back about all were going to get said judith petty chief of 
the census processing staff in jeffersonville ind 
the jeffersonville office is the clearinghouse for all 
undelivered census forms 
ms petty said each bag must be sorted by hand and the forms 
redistributed to district offices so they can be delivered by 
census workers 
ive got about 30000 forms to handdeliver said don 
leadill manager of the census bureaus peoria office 
the postal service checked the census bureaus mailing lists 
before distributing the forms but the post office box problem was 
not discovered because addresses with box numbers werent checked 
ms kremenec said 
ms kremenec said census employees hired to do doortodoor 
surveys next month will be pressed into service to deliver the 
forms we already have the staff on board to go to every house 
that we didnt get a response from she said 
however in at least two central illinois districts extra census 
employees will have to be hired at 6 per hour to deliver the 
forms leadill said he will hire people for the task as will jerry 
harder district manager in bloomington 
we have about 15000 forms being returned to us as 
undeliverable said harder whose largely rural district includes 
13 counties but he said we dont consider it a big problem 
its no big deal

president bush is planting saplings and 
shaking money trees as he travels a transcontinental 1000hotdog 
circuit to raise cash for fellow republicans 
i am president at a fascinating time we are republicans at a 
fascinating time bush tells audiences of contributors who have 
paid a grand apiece sometimes for no more than a frankfurter to 
see him in person 
for a handshake and a photograph and perhaps a few personal 
words from the chief executive the price of admission rises to 
5000 
although bush may have what texas gop gubernatorial candidate 
clayton williams calls wonderful coattails his main help to 
candidates this early in the election cycle is as a drawing card to 
help fill campaign war chests 
and with his high ratings in the public opinion polls bushs 
success at bringing in the green is all but unsurpassed his stops 
this week for candidates in ohio indiana and michigan raised about 
1 million per stop 
consequently bush a former republican national committee 
chairman plans to do more fund raising for other candidates than 
any president in history white house aides say 
white house political operatives and the rnc so far have blocked 
out 25 days of political travel for the president through the end 
of august 
thats really 50 events since we try to do two every day 
said white house spokeswoman alixe glen 
and that doesnt take into account september and october when 
campaigns really heat up and when bush will be on the campaign 
trail almost constantly ms glen said 
bush will campaign for at least 15 gop senate candidates and 16 
gop gubernatorial candidates ms glen said the president will 
leave most house candidates to vice president dan quayle and 
members of the cabinet but will do some campaigning in key 
congressional races she said 
the president uses events like tuesdays treeplanting ceremony 
in a downtown indianapolis park to help defray the costs to 
candidates and to state gop parties 
taxpayers pick up part of the tab when the president includes a 
nonpolitical event with a campaign stop 
you know two weeks ago i told an audience that id been 
planting so many trees all over the country that i might have to 
open a branch office he told the indianapolis audience which 
groaned in unison at his pun 
i knew it he said i tried it once before and got the 
same groan this one is going out of the speech from now and 
evermore 
at a fundraiser monday night in cincinnati for gop 
gubernatorial candidate george voinovich a dance band with an 
accordion struck up hail to the chief and somehow made it sound 
like a polka 
now it isnt often that you hear hail to the chief the 
presidential march on an accordion but its one of the things a 
president has to get used to when hes out on the campaign trail 
wealthy cincinnati republicans in expensive suits furs and 
diamond jewelry stood around stuffing dripping chili dogs into 
their mouths and straining to catch a glimpse of bush 
most seemed delighted to be there although some grumbled 
quietly about the food even the president seemed apologetic 
these are the most expensive hot dogs in the state of ohio he 
exclaimed 
although usually the food fare is more upscale than hot dogs 
the fundraisers basically follow the same formula 1000 for the 
basic ticket 5000 for a more intimate grip and grin session 
that either precedes or follows the main event 
the fundraisers all contain a standard stump speech by the 
president praising the local candidate praising the state 
saying a particular race will be among the most crucial in 
america saluting the nearest major league baseball team and 
remarking on prodemocracy changes in the world 
opportunity is the freedom to root for the team of your 
choice to vote for the candidate of your choice or to eat the 
vegetable of your choice he told a fundraiser in dearborn 
mich tuesday night 
bush also bashes democrats in each speech a guaranteed 
crowdpleaser 
theres another part of the formula that bush follows at all the 
fundraising luncheons banquets and hot dog fests 
he never eats instead he usually tries to sneak out afterward 
and sample a local restaurant

gold whose value skyrocketed as it sat on 
the sea bottom for 133 years has lured columbia university into a 
court battle over the wreck of the ss central america 
the trial that opened tuesday originally pitted the 
columbusamerica discovery group a group of 100 investors with 
exclusive rights to search the ocean bottom for the wreck and the 
45 companies who claim ties to the ships original insurers 
but it was complicated by an announcement that columbia was 
entering the fray the ivy league university contends one of its 
researchers provided data used to locate the goldladen wreck that 
is valued at 450 million to 1 billion 
the exact location of the ship which sank in 1857 about 160 
miles off charleston sc is contained in files sealed by us 
district judge richard b kellam 
columbias attorneys maintain a 1984 sonar survey by dr william 
ryan a columbia oceanographer was the basis for the wrecks 
discovery that survey was funded by harry john who once held 47 
percent of the stock in miller brewing co and jack grimm a texas 
oilman 
according to the school ryan later shared the data with thomas 
g thompson president of columbusamerica without realizing 
thompson would use the material for his own ends 
thompson and his company recovered a ton of gold from the wreck 
last summer company officials believe two tons remain 
thompson agrees that the wreck was located near the point ryans 
data would indicate but denies ryans data was used to locate it 
richard t robol an attorney for columbusamerica an 
ohiobased company described the universitys claim this way 
its a lot like an astronomer taking a picture of the sky that 
picture might contain an unknown planet but the astronomer never 
sees it then 30 years later after exhaustive research a second 
astronomer identifies the unknown planet and the first tries to 
claim he found it 30 years earlier 
columbusamerica officials say columbia in any case lacks the 
equipment to excavate the wreck which lies 1 miles down 
before columbia stepped in the trial was a simple matter over 
whether the wreck had been abandoned the insurance companies 
contended that although their corporate predecessors paid off 12 
million in claims for the disaster they never abandoned claims to 
the gold 
attorneys for columbusamerica argued that the companies did not 
own the treasure just because they insured it 
the ss central america ran into a hurricane and sank on sept 
12 1857 as it sailed to new york from california reports at the 
time put the number of dead at between 362 and 423 of the 578 
people on board 
among the cargo were three tons of gold bars and freshly minted 
double eagle gold coins from the san francisco mint that gold 
was worth 16 million at the time and would be worth about 450 
million at todays prices 
in addition many passengers were carrying fortunes they had 
made in california and columbusamerica officials believe the 
total treasure could be worth up to 1 billion 
the gold recovered last summer is being held by us marshals in 
an undisclosed location

the us court of appeals says it agrees with 
a lower court that the seven bell operating companies cannot enter 
the longdistance or telephone equipment businesses 
however tuesdays ruling reopens the possibility that the 
socalled baby bells can sell electronic information services to 
homes and offices 
the decision means that us district judge harold greene must 
consider anew whether the bell companies may be allowed to develop 
socalled electronic yellow pages allowing consumers to shop 
and bank among other possibilities via cheap easytouse video 
terminals 
a prototype system in france called minitel already serves 5 
million homes and offices and offers 8000 different services 
the threejudge appeals panel found that greene ruled correctly 
when in his 1987 triennial review of the american telephone 
and telegraph co antitrust settlement he sustained the original 
order barring the seven spinoff companies from competing with their 
onetime parent in the longdistance and telephone manufacturing 
arenas 
but appeals judges abner mikva harry edwards and laurence 
silberman faulted greenes legal reasoning when as part of that 
same review he only partially opened the door for the operating 
companies to expand into computerbased information services 
greene allowed the bell companies to offer computer gateways and 
access menus for databases and services offered by other firms 
but not to generate those services themselves that precluded them 
from pursuing a us version of frances governmentoperated 
minitel system 
kenneth pitt media relations director of bell atlantic 
expressed excitement over the appellate ruling though he conceded 
greene could still rule against the bell companies offering a 
variety of prospective services that include banking home 
shopping news real estate listings and medical monitoring

a federal appeals court has ordered 
speededup handling of the case of robert alton harris who would 
have been the first person executed in california in 23 years if 
not for a reprieve 
the us supreme court on monday voted 63 to leave intact a 
stay of execution issued by a lower court that prompted 
predictions from prosecutors that the case would sit for months in 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
but before attorney general john van de kamp could request 
quicker handling of the case the appeals court tuesday ordered it 
the first written arguments from harris lawyers normally due 
in 40 days must be submitted by april 13 remaining briefs from 
both sides will get an additional 17 days rather than 44 and the 
hearing is two weeks later may 14 
no deadline is set for the court to make its ruling 
the panel consists of judge john noonan who issued the order 
last friday blocking harris execution and judges arthur alarcon 
and melvin brunetti 
harris 37 convicted of the 1978 murders of two san diego 
teenagers stood to become the first person executed in california 
since 1967 
he has come within four days of execution twice in 1982 and 
again friday when noonan granted on stay to consider whether 
harris received competent psychiatric assistance at his trial 
hours after he was to have been executed at 3 am tuesday 
harris was removed from a special cell near the san quentin gas 
chamber and returned to death row 
noonans stay of execution centered on whether the psychiatrists 
hired by harris lawyer at his 1979 trial should have tested him 
for brain damage or other mental disorders 
a psychiatrist and psychologist retained by current defense 
lawyers found brain damage symptoms of fetal alcohol effect and 
other disorders and concluded that the previous experts were 
incompetent for failing to test for those problems 
van de kamp contends the us supreme court in a 1985 ruling on 
the issue did not intended to allow a newly hired psychiatrist to 
evaluate the work of earlier experts noonans order would also 
open the door to a wave of attacks on cases in which the 
defendants mental state was at issue van de kamp said

house speaker thomas s foley says he will 
vote against a constitutional amendment to protect the flag if the 
supreme court throws out the federal law against flag burning 
by tradition the speaker of the house rarely votes and foley 
has not done so since becoming speaker 10 months ago but foley 
said he would come off the speakers podium and vote no if the 
house considered a constitutional amendment 
foley last year supported passage of the law against flag 
burning but he said amending the constitution and especially the 
first amendment definition of elemental freedoms of this 
country was not justified 
the first amendment is the most sacred part of the 
constitutional document and to amend it for these reasons would be 
extraordinarily unwise foley said i think the judgment of 
history would be unkind on the congress or the state legislatures 
if that were to occur 
the supreme court has scheduled oral arguments for may 14 on 
whether it will uphold the judgment of two federal courts that the 
flag burning statute passed by congress last year is 
unconstitutional 
foley has promised a house vote on a constitutional amendment 
within 30 days if the court rules against the statute

attorney general dick thornburgh says he will 
direct the justice departments internal disciplinary unit to 
review the results of an fbi leak investigation 
thornburgh said tuesday the office of professional 
responsibility will review the inconclusive results of an fbi 
inquiry into leaks about a criminal investigation involving alleged 
financial irregularities in the office of rep william gray iii 
dpa 
the leak to cbs news at a crucial time while gray was running 
for house majority whip last spring produced a storm of criticism 
from democrats on capitol hill who charged it was politically 
inspired 
it forced the justice department to take the unusual step of 
saying that gray was not a target of the investigation and that he 
was cooperating with the fbi 
the extensive leak investigation ordered by thornburgh failed to 
identify the source with certainty 
the attorney generals decision in december not to refer the 
matter to the opr for possible disciplinary action was criticized 
by several lawmakers including sen joseph r biden jr chairman 
of the senate judiciary committee 
at a hearing of the panel tuesday thornburgh told biden that he 
would ask opr to review the report produced by the fbi 
investigation

ann richards is offering no apologies for 
her campaign tactics after former gov mark white likened her 
behavior to that of gestapo chief heinrich himmler 
stopping short of endorsing attorney general jim mattox over ms 
richards in the april 10 democratic runoff for governor white on 
tuesday said he would vote in that race but not for ms richards 
i will never endorse ann richards i will never support ann 
richards and i will never vote for ann richards said white 
whose comeback bid collapsed when he finished a distant third in 
last months democratic primary 
ive always thought he mattox was one of the toughest 
campaigners ive ever seen but what ann richards has done would 
make himmler blush white said 
during a campaign stop in san benito ms richards said well 
thats too bad i really dont think that its like mark white 
to call anyone a nazi 
the republican nominee for governor oilman clayton williams 
had courted white hoping to win the exgovernors endorsement 
williams press secretary bill kenyon said 
were happy with the governors statement we think it 
illustrates that moderatetoconservative democrats have no real 
choice in this runoff and the general election we believe that they 
will be attracted to clayton williams 
white criticized ms richards the state treasurer for tv 
commercials and speeches in which she alleged that he had profited 
from public service and helped his old law firm obtain state bond 
business while he was governor 
white said ms richards willfully and knowingly smeared me 
with false accusations that she knew at the time to be untrue 
she didnt do it just once in the heat of an argument she did 
it with inexcusable regularity in the last days of the campaign 
white 
ms richards campaign manager glenn smith said the campaign 
stands by its tv commercials critical of white 
ann richards fulfilled the pledge she made when she announced 
her candidacy she said she would run a positive campaign until 
she was attacked and she was by both her opponents smith 
said like all of us mr white should support any candidate he 
chooses and im sure hell let his conscience be his guide 
meanwhile mattox charged tuesday that he has signed statements 
from witnesses alleging ms richards has used illegal drugs in the 
past 10 years he faced three reporters alone because ms richards 
declined to attend the debate citing a previous commitment 
mattox said he has proof from the perspective of individuals 
that have said to me that ann richards has used certain drugs 
mattox refused to identify his informants 
ms richards a recovering alcoholic has been under fire for 
weeks for refusing to say whether she ever used illegal drugs she 
has said only that she has not used any moodaltering drugs in 
10 years

the labor deparments crackdown on child labor law violations 
was called nitpicking by one businessman and criticized by 
others who said it contradicted the governments goal of finding 
jobs for teenagers 
nearly 3 million in fines have been levied on fastfood 
restaurants and other businesses for nearly 11000 violations cited 
in a threeday federal sweep labor department officials said 
tuesday 
most of the violations involved teenagers working more hours or 
later hours during the school week than is allowed under federal 
law others were illegally employed in dangerous jobs such as 
using powerdriven meat slicers dough mixers and paper balers the 
department said 
most of the companies fined agreed violations had occurred but 
said they were petty and unavoidable 
the crackdown seemed to contradict labor secretary elizabeth 
doles recently expressed concern about jobs for youngsters said 
deborah jackson president of morgan memorial goodwill industries 
inc a boston affiliate of goodwill that was fined 6000 for 
various violations 
on the one hand the dol is citing an organization as fine as 
goodwill and on the other hand elizabeth dole is making a 
statement and the two dont seem to be in concert jackson said 
one of the violations charged that youths illegally packaged 
plastic toys in boxes she said 
if not this kind of job im not sure how they intend to 
provide opportunities she said frankly the jobs safe enough 
for my 9yearold 
reams food stores in utah were fined about 20000 for 
violations involving about 80 youngsters 
the violations were not flagrant at all in most cases they 
involved kids working 10 minutes beyond their three hours said 
general manager dick cheney we feel that weve obeyed the spirit 
of the law and that theyre nitpicking theyre on some kind of 
crusade 
dozens of companies were listed from around the country 
including individual restaurants that are part of the mcdonalds 
taco bell jack in the box and burger king chains 
nearly half the fastfood restaurants and other businesses 
targeted in the sweep were found to be employing children 
illegally said william brooks an assistant labor secretary of 
the 3776 firms investigated violations were found at 1750 he 
said 
the largest fine 29050 was levied against gff foods a 
moore okla supermarket where juveniles operated a paperbaler 
used to smash cardboard boxes 
gary pierson an attorney for store owner truman talley said 
i dont believe my client had any intent to do anything illegal 
or to risk the health of any employees 
mike doty a 19yearold deli employee at gff who has worked at 
groceries since he was 14 said the store seemed strict about use 
of hazardous machinery 
the box crusher has signs all over it saying anyone under 18 
is not supposed to use it and here they keep a pretty close eye on 
it he said 
dole defended the crackdown saying new findings reinforce our 
belief that the trend toward violations is growing 
companies have the right to appeal the fines they think are 
unfair 
federal law forbids 14 and 15yearolds from working more than 
three hours on a school day or 18 hours a week during the school 
year eight hours are permitted on weekend days and 40hour weeks 
are permitted in summer and during vacations

life choices are limited in this 
small dusty town and jose manuel marquez hernandez was among the 
young people who looked to the united states for a better future 
for marquez 24 the immigrants dream of prosperity ended on 
march 25 in a fire at the happy land social club in new york city 
he and six other young hondurans were buried this week in el 
progreso a town of 30000 
they were among 87 people killed in the fire at least 78 were 
hondurans most from the northern atlantic coast region 
the local victims came from poor families and had few choices a 
lowly job at one of the us fruit companies that made honduras the 
original banana republic a deadend job in san pedro sula a 
coastal industrial center of 600000 people or immigration to new 
york a promised land of jobs education and opportunity 
marquez left six years ago 
he wrote me last month said gregorio hernandez his uncle 
he had gotten his high school equivalency diploma he was 
applying to go to college 
meanwhile marquez worked at a factory cutting leather to make 
clothing handbags and shoes even at minimum wage he earned 
enough to survive and send money home to his mother 
i wrote him back hernandez said i said become a 
professional a professional never goes hungry a professional 
lands on his feet anywhere life throws him 
hernandez was the first person in his family of nine children to 
finish high school my three older brothers only finished the 
eighth grade because back then there wasnt a high school here and 
my father didnt have the money to send them to san pedro sula 
hernandez said 
the brothers worked for the tela railroad co a subsidiary of 
chiquita brands which has extensive banana plantations in honduras 
hernandez became a supervisor at a textile factory in san pedro 
sula and assumed the leadership of the extended family because of 
his education and job in the big city 
wanting something better for his own children and those of his 
brothers and sisters he sent his daughter and marquez to new york 
to live with relatives 
he never once failed with his monthly money for his mother and 
his brothers and sister said hernandez 
when marquezs older sister one of four children started 
college in san pedro sula marquez sent her a new typewriter when 
he came home for christmas he brought gifts a book for an aunt 
sunglasses for his twin younger brothers a small stereo for the 
family and money for his mother who has been separated from his 
father for years 
he was her sole support said hernandez 
marquezs christmas visit was the first since he left el 
progreso 
last sunday he returned in a slateblue coffin on a red cross 
charter jet that carried the bodies of 47 other hondurans as well 
the hernandez clan and neighborhood friends met him as they had 
at christmas 
weve had to borrow money to pay for the funeral and the plot 
in the cemetery about 1200 lempiras 300 said hernandez 
were not rich but we had to give him a proper burial 
at the crowded cemetery in el progreso a boyhood friend jose 
cardenas 24 perched on one of the simple cementcovered graves 
painted pink blue and white and overrun with weeds and dust from 
unpaved streets 
cardenas had also gone to new york but was deported last year 
as an illegal alien 
leaving here for new york is a change of life for the better 
because there is nothing here he said as marquezs funeral 
procession arrived 
you stay here and do this he said pointing to a ragclad 
grave digger or you go to new york

he was impish indignant humorous 
uncompromising and of course long on words another typical 
evening for president fidel castro 
and his message was clear cubas revolution at age 31 is 
stronger than ever thanks in no small measure to the patriotic 
feelings stirred up by tv marti transmissions by the united states 
the scene was tuesday night at the palace of conventions where 
castro regaled more than 200 foreign and local journalists for more 
than two hours he held their attention throughout and was mobbed 
afterward 
castro even found good in the collapse of oneparty communist 
rule in eastern europe saying cuba will be able to benefit from 
the mistakes committed by the regions ousted communist leaders 
cuba chose the right path castro said because capitalism has 
brought to the rest of latin america rampant disease inflation 
unemployment and illiteracy he said cuba had virtually eliminated 
those problems 
he brushed aside a question about predictions of his demise 
saying only god knows and feigned indignation when a mexican 
reporter said he looked tired 
castro invited journalists from all over the world to visit cuba 
this week as it engages the united states in a war of words and 
electronics over voice of america telecasts to cuba 
the transmissions known as tv marti began march 27 and cuba 
immediately began jamming them this week cuban officials have 
been showing off their jamming operations to the foreign reporters 
while denouncing the trial us telecasts in the strongest 
terms castro said tuesday that they play right into his hands 
this war this aggression this hostility far from weakening 
the revolution is strengthening it it exalts the patriotic 
feelings of the people their honor their pride he said 
the more they attack the revolution the more stupidities they 
go on doing the stronger the revolution will be 
cubas official news agency prensa latina paraphrased castros 
comments and the news conference and said he warned that cuba 
can also carry out surgical operations and remarked that such a 
us action could end in war thus far despite many predictions 
by cuban officials of a strong response castro has been content 
just to jam tv marti transmissions 
the stated us goal is to bring entertainment and balanced news 
to cuba but castro calls the project a gross instrument of 
subversion 
he suggested that a future target may be another us broadcast 
operation radio marti which cuba has allowed to function 
relatively unfettered since 1985 
castro said it would be wrong to assume that cuba will allow the 
united states to beam radio waves at the island indefinitely 
the ideal solution he said is to allow cuba the same radio 
access to the united states but he did not see that as a strong 
possibility 
the united states cannot refrain from pursuing its feeling of 
being the owner of the world castro said 
on monday president bush hailed tv marti as the latest us 
effort to broadcast the truth to communist countries the 
television station is named after jose marti a hero of cuban 
independence 
one result of ussoviet detente said castro is an 
increasingly aggressive american attitude peace for the 
superpowers but not for countries on the us enemies list 
united states policy implies the right to intervene in latin 
america or anywhere in the world castro said citing us 
military actions in such countries as panama libya and the 
philippines

the clock back on contract talks between striking drivers and 
greyhound which says it wont negotiate until a week passes 
without violence

officer said today 
earlier tuesday a southeastern trailways bus was hit by sniper 
fire on interstate 65 about 50 miles south of louisville ky 
neither the driver nor the lone passenger was injured 
a greyhound spokesman steve scarpino said the gunmen attacking 
southeastern may be confusing the independently owned line with 
other trailways lines greyhound owns 
greyhound which has offered a 100000 reward for evidence 
against snipers who have fired on at least 30 buses since the 
strike by 6300 union drivers began march 2 called off talks set

chinese are being warned not to wear black 
armbands or white flowers of mourning on thursday the annual 
holiday when chinese honor their dead and a potential time for 
antigovernment protests 
chinese sources said today that some offices and factories in 
beijing were advising workers against displays of mourning on 
qingming when chinese traditionally sweep the graves of their 
ancestors 
the beijing city government has issued orders that ban organized 
group visits to cemeteries unless permission is received from 
authorities 
overseas dissident groups have called on students to stroll 
through tiananmen square on thursday in a silent memorial to the 
hundreds of people killed when the military crushed the 
prodemocracy movement last june 
a similar appeal to stage protest strolls on sunday was 
thwarted when police closed the square to the public ostensibly 
for daylong ceremonies to promote civic enthusiasm for the asian 
games 
the games are to be held in beijing in september 
the government wants to avoid a repetition of the 1976 qingming 
festival when thousands streamed to tiananmen to honor premier 
chou enlai who had died earlier in the year and protest the 
partys leftist leaders 
suppression of the protesters helped lead to the downfall of the 
leftists 
beijing citizens are also being told by officials at work and 
school to stay away from tiananmen square the focal point of last 
years demonstrations factory leaders have been warned they will 
be held responsible if workers are involved in any protests 
a source on one university campus said some students planned to 
go to the square on thursday but that most were frightened and 
would stay away they have been told they face expulsion or 
assignment to work in a remote rural area if caught protesting 
police and military presence around the 100acre square has been 
particularly heavy in the past week partly because the national 
peoples congress chinas parliament is holding its annual 
session in the great hall of the people west of the square 
today 300 to 400 police clearing the square for the closing 
session of the congress pushed and struck with clubs people who 
were slow in leaving a foreign witness said it was not clear if 
anyone was injured 
since sunday two americans a reporter and a student were 
detained for an hour or more by police for photographing police or 
soldiers on the square they were told taking photos of people 
without police permission was not allowed

king baudouin a devout catholic 
stepped down temporarily today rather than sign into law a bill 
ending the countrys 123year ban on abortion 
after relieving the king as head of state the government 
enacted the abortion bill and asked parliament to restore him as 
monarch at a special session on thursday 
the highly unusual move made at the kings request let the 
government enact legislation to allow abortion in the first 12 
weeks of pregnancy and relieved the king of his constitutional duty 
to sign into law a bill he strongly opposes parliament adopted the 
bill last week 
the royal suspension came after prime minister wilfried martens 
centerleft government consulted with the 59yearold king who 
insisted he could not sign the legislation 
the kings powers are largely ceremonial he has no real 
legislative powers but under the constitution he signs into law all 
the bills 
in practice the king also plays an active role behind the 
scenes consulting regularly with government ministers he has 
repeatedly acted to defuse disputes between dutch and 
frenchspeaking political parties which often are locked in 
linguistic disputes 
in public speeches he also has urged belgiums 6 million dutch 
and 4 million frenchspeakers to be more considerate of one another 
the government made clear king baudouin insisted on finding a 
compromise on the abortion legislation 
judging that his conscience did not permit him to sign the 
abortion bill the head of state asked the government and the 
parliament to find a legal solution in which the need of the good 
functioning of parliamentary democracy can be reconciled with the 
right of the king not to act in violation of his conscience it 
said in a statement 
the statement said the royal suspension was legal under the 
constitution which provides for the removal of the monarch if he 
or she is deemed to be in the impossibility of executing his 
functions 
that clause had only been applied once before 
in 1940 king leopold iii baudouins father was suspended 
after he was taken prisoner by nazi germany 
after the war leopold could not return home because of a 
controversy over his wartime conduct his brother prince charles 
became regent and was succeeded by king baudouin in 1950

a colorado stockbroker has offered to set up a charitable trust 
for wealthy people who dont have heirs a special education 
professor said he will donate up to a year of his time and a 
virginian gave the group suggestions on how to set up a 
fundraising network 
people do care said carol van noy a member of the school 
committee that placed the ad but our millionaire hasnt come 
forth im hopeful we really do need 10 million 
thats what riverview school superintendent karen forys 
estimated as the cost to replace the current high school and middle 
school complex which is overcrowded 
the ad which ran thursday will be run once more for free on 
thursday because the newspaper misspelled the districts name as 
riverside 
well be checking the mailbox everyday said committee

a suburb is having a devil of a time with its new 
voting precinct number 
deer park council members approved a resolution tuesday asking 
the commissioners of harris county to renumber precinct 666 because 
some religious folk view the number as symbolic of the antichrist 
deer park is a fairly conservative religious community and 
its just a stigma they dont want said harvey petree a deer 
park city councilman 
i had never heard that the three sixes had any religious 
connotation said county commissioner jim fonteno if i would 
have known then what i know now i would have just asked the clerk 
to skip a number 
election officials redrew precinct 470 in august because it had 
grown to include 3200 residents fonteno said the county splits 
any precinct with more than 3000 residents each august with the 
new numbers taking effect in march 
when the deer park districts were split the new jurisdiction 
got the next available number 666

but the leader lawmaker simranjeet singh mann also added 
sikhs are being massacred our constitutional rights are being

a drug used to treat genital herpes has been 
found to speed up childrens recovery from chickenpox a university 
of minnesota study says 
acyclovir reduced the number of itchy blisters and shortened by 
a day the normal fiveday course of chickenpox in 50 twin cities 
children who received the drug according to a report in this 
months journal of pediatrics 
acyclovir is a safe and effective treatment for the illness 
which almost every american gets sometime during childhood said 
dr henry balfour the pediatrician who headed the study 
balfour said tuesday that the finding is important because most 
complications develop near the end of a typical fiveday infection 
he said some doctors may delay prescribing acyclovir until 
results of a larger 10city study are released probably later 
this year 
other doctors may limit the use of acyclovir to youngsters 11 
and older who tend to have the most severe cases of chickenpox 
balfour said but he predicted that its use eventually will be 
widespread 
chickenpox is caused by the varicellazoster virus a member of 
the herpes family of viruses so it was natural to try the herpes 
drug against it he said 
about 35 million americans a year develop chickenpox about 
4000 children are hospitalized each year from complications of the 
disease which include skin or ear infections pneumonia and brain 
infections balfour said 
no chickenpox vaccine is licensed for use in the united states 
but vaccines are being tried in other countries he said 
in the study within a day of developing their first chickenpox 
sores 50 youngsters got a syrup containing acyclovir and 52 others 
got one with no medication in it 
the children getting the acyclovir ended up developing an 
average of 336 skin lesions compared with more than 500 lesions 
for those who didnt get it 
healing started within a day after the youngsters got acyclovir 
compared with two days for those who didnt get it 
blood tests a year later indicated that acyclovir didnt 
interfere with the youngsters developing immunity to this virus a 
process that normally prevents a person from having a second case 
of chickenpox 
the study sponsored in part by burroughs wellcome co 
manufacturer of acyclovir was carried out from february through 
june 1987 testing for immunity and analysis took two years

a decade ago governors in the northeast were 
riding a wave of economic growth to political heights but hard 
times have plunged them into the depths of a political depression 
as well as an economic one 
vermonts madeleine kunin on tuesday became the third 
northeastern governor to decide against reelection this year 
announcing she wont seek a fourth twoyear term her states 
budget has been sharply cut while a 12 percent increase in the 
personal income tax has been proposed 
all three of the retiring governors are democrats whose 
political futures cascaded with the economy and failed legislative 
programs 
theres economic depression and also depressions in the 
political world i think were in one said frank bryan 
associate professor of political science at the university of 
vermont in burlington one of the symptoms of political 
depression is the candidate says the hell with it it isnt worth 
it to fight through this anymore 
the governors apparently are tired of the burdens and negative 
reaction they would face in reelection bids next fall 
this is really a typical pattern for difficult economic 
times said larry sabato a professor of government at the 
university of virginia who follows governors closely when a 
egion is in trouble economically governors are simply encouraged to 
retire they get tired of the burdens and also realize they might 
be defeated they dont want to go out that way 
that apparently was the case with govs michael s dukakis of 
massachusetts and william a oneill of connecticut 
dukakis won the 1988 democratic presidential nomination partly 
on the strength of the massachusetts miracle that economic 
takeoff began unraveling even during dukakis white house campaign 
dukakis announced more than a year ago that he would not seek a 
third consecutive term his state faces a deficit of at least 780 
million 
two weeks ago oneill said he would not seek a third full term 
after his standing in the polls dropped his unpopularity 
apparently stemmed from nearly 1 billion in tax increases he 
approved last year 
the big question is if there are going to be any exceptions to 
this process said paul watanabe head of the political science 
department at the university of massachusetts at boston 
watanabe said political analysts will be watching whether gov 
mario cuomo of new york a potential democratic presidential 
candidate is able to buck the trend 
in some respects so far he has said watanabe i think 
hes been effective in indicating his ability to manage a crisis 
within new york and his ability to do so is going to significantly 
effect perceptions of him as a viable national figure 
cuomo is facing his third consecutive year of budget deficits 
and is talking about 1 billion in higher taxes he has said he 
expects to seek reelection to a third term but has made no formal 
announcement 
the gop has branded cuomo the michael dukakis of new york 
but the republicans have not put up a strong candidate of their 
own independent polls still give cuomo high ratings 
cuomo said tuesday that being a governor has become more and 
more difficult largely because the federal government is shifting 
more financial responsibility to the states 
the economic woes thus far have not derailed the plans of the 
regions three republican governors to seek reelection 
gov judd gregg of new hampshire has overcome a 160 million 
deficit the legislature cut services laid off state employees and 
raised taxes on cigarettes beer gasoline rooms and meals 
business profits and real estate transfers gregg opposes a general 
sales and income tax 
maine is facing a 210 million deficit but gov john r 
mckernan said he is not abandoning his reelection campaign he has 
strong opposition from his predecessor democrat joseph e brennan 
who has made the budget problems a key issue 
even though rhode island gov edward d dipretes popularity in 
a recent brown university poll dipped to an alltime low of 30 
percent he is seeking his fourth twoyear term diprete is saddled 
with a 100 million deficit and has made cuts in social programs

israels second experimental satellite is 
orbiting the earth every 90 minutes and will remain in space for 
about 60 days israel space agency officials said today 
until now all funcitons are working as planned and we are 
very satisfied with it space agency administrator moshe barlev 
told israel radio 
the 350pound satellite ofek2 was launched tuesday by a 
threestage rocket developed by israel 
barlev said the satellite had circled earth 16 times so far and 
that scientists are able to contact it the every time it passes 
over the country 
the director of the space agency yuvall neeman said the ofek2 
was lifted into space by the shavit hebrew for comet 
launcher which was developed by the israel aircraft industries 
it has two stages that are big rockets and a third and last 
stage which is really a small engine used to put the satellite into 
its proper orbit he told the associated press 
he said the engine was a slightly modified version of the shavit 
rocket that lifted israels first satellite ofek1 into space on 
sept 19 1988 ofek1 remained aloft for four months 
the yediot aharonot and the alhamishmar newspapers quoted 
foreign reports as saying the shavit was a modified version of the 
launcher designed to propel the jerichoii a surfacetosurface 
missile with a range of 1375 miles 
earlier foreign reports said the ofek1 was also launched by the 
rocket that propels the jerichoii 
neeman said he had no information of the jericho missiles and a 
spokesman for the israel aircraft industries said he knew nothing 
about any such missile

premier li peng said today that the chinese 
leadership is united and strong and he rejected the possiblity 
of a comeback for his disgraced predecessor zhao ziyang 
in a 90minute news conference his first meeting with foreign 
reporters in almost a year li said i dont think im extremely 
capable or extremely rich in political experience or entirely up to 
this job 
but he added that he was somewhat more confident than when i 
was nominated to the post in 1988 for a fiveyear term 
also today the national peoples congress or parliament 
closed its annual session after passing bills on hong kong and 
joint ventures aimed at reassuring a doubtful world the doors to 
china remained open 
the 2700 deputies to the 15day session also approved a work 
report by li that said china would never yield to threats against 
its socialist system 
in the report chinas version of a stationofthenation 
address li hailed the victory over the prodemocracy 
movement which troops crushed in june in an assault on central 
beijing that claimed hundreds of lives 
but at the news conference lis first appearance before the 
foreign press since june he refused to specify who ordered the 
crackdown saying that force was used only after a long period of 
patient waiting and after the nation and its socialist system was 
jeopardized by anarchy 
the 62yearold premier appeared relaxed and confident but his 
responses were generally vague 
the core of leadership with communist party chief jiang 
zemin as the nucleus is united and strong and i believe it 
commands the support of the chinese people said li who declined 
to speculate on his own political future 
he said the decision by parliament tuesday to name jiang to 
replace senior leader deng xiaoping as chairman of the state 
central military commission confirmed the army was under the 
absolute leadership of the party 
he said jiangs appointment to the last official post the 
85yearold deng had held would contribute to political 
stability 
jiang was named head of the 48millionmember communist party in 
june after zhao was purged for allegedly supporting the 
prodemocracy students and dividing the party 
li said zhao who has not been seen in public since may was in 
good health living at home in beijing and had not been imprisoned 
zhao who was stripped of all his party posts remains a party 
member but investigations into his activities continue li said 
he doubted whether zhao who still commands a wide silent 
following in china because of his reformist policies could stage a 
political comeback i dont think that is the prediction of the 
majority of the chinese people 
li said the justconcluded parliament session would inspire 
the chinese people to work with one heart and one mind to promote 
political and social stability 
the congress wields little political power in chinas 
partydominated system 
in his stateofthenation report delivered on parliaments 
opening day li said economic sanctions imposed by western nations 
after the crackdown would fail and china would stand firm against 
any foreign and domestic hostile forces trying to subvert 
communist party rule 
all proposals submitted by parliament chairman wan li were 
passed by overwhelming majorities 
the two key bills approved today define the basic law for hong 
kong after it reverts to chinese rule in 1997 and amend the joint 
venture law to further protect foreign investors in china 
the basic law provides that hong kong will have a high level of 
autonomy on all matters except national defense and foreign affairs 
after 1997 and that its capitalist system will be untouched for 50 
years 
it also says the legal system adopted under british colonial 
rule will in general be kept and that hong kong will remain an 
international financial center and free port 
political activists in the colony have expressed misgivings 
about the basic law saying it will impede democratic reform in 
hong kong and give beijing arbitrary powers to declare a state of 
emergency 
the amendments to the 1979 joint venture law were seen as a 
gesture to foreign investors wary of doing business in china after 
the crackdown 
they stipulate that the lifetime of a joint venture previously 
limited to 30 years can be openended and guarantee that such 
ventures will never be nationalized under normal circumstances 
the law was also amended to say a foreign partner could be 
elected chairman of the venture previously the chinese side 
headed the board even when the foreign partners equity share 
exceeded 50 percent

in an unusual but not unprecedented move the 
smithsonian institution will charge fees for a temporary exhibit 
opening next week 
smithsonian undersecretary dean anderson said the charge for 
dinamations dinosaurs alive and in color was an experiment 
that will allow the museum to display an exhibit that otherwise 
would be too expensive to produce 
the exhibition on dinosaurs at the museum of natural history 
will cost 4 for adults 2 for children under 12 and will be free 
for children under 3 
we pride ourselves on being free to the public we have a 
sense that coming to the smithsonian is tantamount to an exercise 
of citizenship only if were doing something very special does it 
make sense to charge a fee anderson said 
the smithsonian joined with dinamation international inc of san 
juan capistrano calif in a joint venture to develop and show 
the smithsonian will receive a share of the profits of the show 
which runs through sept3 
anderson noted that the museum charges admission for its 
planetarium and films at the air and space museum and officials 
said the smithsonians arts and industry museum charged 25 cents 
for an exhibit on drug abuse in the early 1970s 
the national zoo also run by the smithsonian will test an 
admission charge for another dinosaur exhibit officials said

restorers cleaning michelangelos last 
judgment have decided not to remove changes another artist made 
to cover images deemed offensive in the sistine chapel fresco 
vatican museum officials said 
in 1564 pope pius iv after siding with some 16thcentury 
church officials shocked by nude figures in the 60by30foot 
painting on the wall above the chapel altar ordered artist daniele 
da volterra to cover up the most indecent nudes 
fabrizio mancinelli directing the cleaning of michelangelos 
sistine chapel frescoes told a news conference tuesday that 
instead of painting over michelangelos creation da volterra 
substituted his own fresco after first removing michelangelos 
since the additions are in fresco removing the original 
fresco there is no real choice to take away those portions 
said kathleen weilgarris brandt a new york university art 
historian who is a consultant on the sistine chapel project 
mancinelli and ms brandt said a conference of 54 international 
specialists who met last week at the vatican decided there would be 
no attempt to remove the additions 
michelangelo painted the last judgment more than 20 years 
after he finished the ceiling which he worked on between 1508 and 
1512 the painting now hidden by scaffolding depicts a forceful 
christ standing in judgment surrounded by apprehensive saints 
angels and mythological figures 
mancinelli said the work to clean the masterpiece the last 
phase of the sistine chapel restoration will take about four 
years including the time needed for scientific evaluation of the 
painting and the cleaning methods to ensure the work is not damaged 
in the process 
the chapel restoration has been been surrounded by controversy 
critics led by james beck a columbia university art historian 
charged that the restorters were removing some of michelangelos 
retouchings and altering the colors of the frescoes 
mancinelli said the team left michelangelos work intact 
removing only a dirty gluevarnish that had been added by restorers 
in the 17th and 18th centuries 
to protect the newly cleaned frescoes and still allow them to be 
seen by thousands of visitors each day the vatican is regulating 
the humidity and has installed antidust carpets

cambodian government troops 
backed by tanks and heavy artillery today retook a strategic town 
held by noncommunist guerrillas according to guerrilla and 
western sources 
the district capital of tmar pouk fell late this morning after 
continuous heavy attacks that began the previous day the sources 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
tmar pouk is in northwestern cambodia close to the thai 
frontier it was held by the two noncommunist guerrilla factions 
opposing the vietnameseinstalled phnom penh government the khmer 
peoples national liberation front and fighters loyal to former 
monarch prince norodom sihanouk 
government troops backed by sovietmade tanks and artillery 
attacked tmar pouk from positions to the south that had been 
retaken over the past weeks a senior liberation front official 
said 
guerrilla sources also reported a heavy government attack on a 
liberation front military headquarters at boueng trakuan opposite 
the thai town of taphraya 30 miles north of aranyaprathet 
western relief workers in taphraya said the shelling across the 
border was so heavy it shook houses in the town 
as many as 5000 refugees have fled the fighting to the giant 
site 2 refugee camp about 60 miles north of aranyaprathet western 
relief officials said 
western diplomats said there were reports that thousands more 
civilians had fled tmar pouk to take refuge in remaining 
guerrillaheld areas inside cambodia which the guerrillas call 
liberated zones 
the diplomats expected government troops would continue their 
push northward to the last remaining liberation front stronghold of 
banteay chamar 
this spells the end for the liberated zones the only 
remaining stronghold of banteay chamar will now fall for sure 
one of the diplomats said 
a senior liberation front official said the fall of tmar pouk 
occurred because a shipment of chinese weapons failed to arrive 
china is a main backer of the guerrillas 
western relief workers also said there were reports of heavy 
government attacks on khmer rouge positions opposite the town of 
trat on the southernmost part of thailand border with cambodia 
these had occurred over the past few weeks but the sources had no 
more details 
the government launched a major counteroffensive in late 
february and has succeeded in retaking much of the area seized by 
the guerrillas shortly after vietnam said it had withdrawn all its 
progovernment troops in late september 
the vietnamese invaded cambodia in late 1978 to stop border 
attacks by the communist khmer rouge which controlled cambodia 
from 19751978 during that time hundreds of thousands of 
cambodias 8 million people died from khmer rouge executions 
famine and civil unrest 
the vietnamesebacked cambodian government has been fighting a 
coalition of three major cambodian resistance groups the khmer 
rouge the khmer peoples national liberation front and followers 
of sihanouk for control of the country international peace 
efforts have so far failed 
earlier today sihanouk returned to bangkok from beijing en 
route to his home in a liberated zone in oddar meanchey province 
north of tmar pouk a spokesman for the prince ek sereywath said

east germanys major political parties today 
resumed talks on forming a government on the eve of the opening 
session of the countrys first freely elected parliament 
the major powerbrokers in the coalition talks said they were 
optimistic that a new government could be formed soon but not 
before the middle of next week 
the conservative alliance for germany which won the most 
parliament seats in the march 18 elections is trying to form a 
coalition with the social democrats who finished a distant second 
the major parties met separately today after meeting together 
the day before spokesmen later said it was unlikely a new 
government would be formed this week 
the talks are crucial to the formation of a cabinet that will 
lead negotiations with west germany and the former world war ii 
allies on unification of the two german states 
the alliance for germany led by lothar de maiziere the likely 
premier of the nation favors rapid reunification while the 
leftleaning social democrats want a gradual melding of nations 
the negotiations took on an air of urgency this week after west 
germanys central bank recommended a 21 conversion of east german 
marks to west german marks as part of a currency union 
east german parties united in opposition to that proposal and 
called for a direct 11 conversion to ease the withdrawal pains of 
unemployment and high prices as east germany sheds it socialist 
system 
but the social democrats still are opposed to the more 
conservative elements in de maizieres coalition much of the 
wrangling has been over the distribution of cabinet posts in a 
newly formed government 
there are indeed as before substantial differences but these 
are not insurmountable lawmaker richard schroeder leader of the 
social democrat faction in parliament said tuesday 
social democrat spokesman guenther krug said there would not be 
a coalition if the social democrats positions were not adequately 
represented in a coalition platform expected to be hammered out 
during negotiations 
the first openly elected lawmaking body in the nations history 
is to convene on thursday in what will likely be a ceremonial 
session with little substantive political action 
since east germans toppled the hardline government of erich 
honecker in october a communist caretaker has been running the 
economically troubled nation 
the talks have been hamstrung over allegations that many members 
of the new parliament cooperated with or worked for the former 
secret police of the old stalinist leadership 
social democrat leader ibrahim boehme resigned over the weekend 
because of such allegations although he has denied involvement 
de maiziere has denied similar allegations

the city board of supervisors is 
considering a resolution to urge the legislature to pay for testing 
in san francisco of the french abortion pill 
a group of doctors has formulated a plan to test the pill 
called ru 486 at three san francisco hospitals it is estimated 
that clinical trials involving some 200 women would cost 60000 to 
100000 
the proposal introduced by supervisor terence hallinan on 
monday was developed at the urging of former city supervisor carol 
ruth silver she heads an organization aiming to make ru 486 
available to women in the united states 
the federal food and drug administration has indicated it would 
not approve clinical trials of the drug because of the bush 
administrations objections to abortion moreover antiabortion 
groups oppose the pill 
testing in california could be conducted under state legislation 
originally passed to help speed testing of aids drugs 
however fda spokesman jeff nesbit said tuesday california 
law for testing only involves drugs that are made tested and sold 
in california if the drug is imported it triggers fda 
jurisdiction 
the fda has allowed only one group of us researchers at the 
university of southern california to import the drug for a limited 
trial

the martin luther king jr federal holiday commission counts 46 
states going on 47 as having an official state holiday honoring 
the late civil rights leader but not everyone agrees on that count 
arizona new hampshire and montana will be the only states 
without a king holiday with the governors promised signature of a 
bill approved last week in idaho according to margie hollums of 
the commission staff 
but north dakotas holiday isnt paid and louisianas is by 
proclamation rather than legislation and some of the king day 
states give employees other holiday options 
three states have established the holiday as a day other than 
the third monday in january louisiana makes it jan 19 maryland 
jan 15 and new jersey the monday after jan 15 
backers of the king holiday sometimes have argued that it is not 
official unless it is adopted by legislation as a paid holiday on a 
weekday under that logic the number of states with a holiday will 
be no more than 45 and as few as 43 depending whether the dates 
set by louisiana and maryland fall on weekdays in any given year 
washington dc puerto rico guam and the virgin islands have 
a paid holiday the first two by legislation and the latter two by 
executive order

threats to water supplies created by a fuel 
spill in the allegheny river waned as the slick snaked along the 
ohio river toward ohio and west virginia 
in our tests were seeing a marked dissipation in the amounts 
of fuel throughout the rivers said betsy mallison spokeswoman 
for the pennsylvania department of environmental resources 
the concentration of petroleum 5 feet deep in the ohio river at 
west view dropped from 75 parts per billion at 1 pm to 25 parts 
per billion six hours later ms mallison said 
the spill which stretched 14 miles through the river in 
industrial beaver county early today came from at least 75000 
gallons of diesel gasoline and kerosene seeped from a severed 
interstate pipeline into an allegheny river tributary friday after 
a mudslide near freeport in rural armstrong county the allegheny 
flows into the ohio river at pittsburgh 
the spill at one time had threatened the water supplies of up to 
1 million people along the allegheny and ohio rivers 
the midland water authority about five miles east of the ohio 
and west virginia state lines closed its intakes at 11 pm 
tuesday and the spills leading edge passed about 2 hours later 
plant manager john uccellini said the authority serves 11700 
beaver county residents in midland ohioville and industry 
uccellini said state environmental officials would test the 
water for oil concentrations and the intakes likely would be 
reopened later today 
across the ohio border officials in east liverpool were testing 
the water but had detected no trace of oil as of 845 am said 
joe miller chief of the east liverpool filtration plant 
the water authority in east liverpool which serves about 7000 
customers closed two intakes near the surface of the water but 
hoped to continue drawing water from an intake at the bottom of the 
river miller said 
the state national guard offered 100 water tankers to midland 
area residents said russell chiodo director of the beaver county 
emergency management agency 
i pray that we dont need them he said 
the spill was no threat to other water systems serving beaver 
county because those systems draw well water chiodo added 
freeport the first city to stop drawing water over the weekend 
reopened intakes that were closed for 3 days ten water plants 
along the allegheny had resumed use of river water tuesday night 
ms mallison said 
about 20000 residents of harrison township were asked to boil 
water to kill bacteria that might have grown in the system when it 
was empty she said 
nine oilcollecting booms on the allegheny were removed because 
they werent necessary said federal environmental protection 
agency spokeswoman carrie deitzel sixteen other booms remained in 
the river 
the state is calculating environmental and lostwater costs to 
be charged to the owner of the severed petroleum line 
allentownbased buckeye pipeline co said mark mcclellan the 
department of environmental resources deputy secretary 
the company also could face fines for delaying notification of 
the spill to the state he said

for more than half of the nations 20000 
hemophiliacs the aids virus is a fixture of daily life just like 
the blood protein supplements that both keep them well and gave 
them the dangerous infection 
like ryan white the indiana teenager whose fight against aids 
bias made him a national symbol most hemophiliacs became infected 
during the early 1980s before anyone knew that the virus was 
spreading silently by means of their medical treatment 
hemophilia is an inherited disorder in which blood fails to clot 
properly to prevent uncontrolled bleeding hemophiliacs need 
infusions of factor viii a bloodclotting protein that their 
bodies lack the substance is refined from the blood of many donors 
the treatment became tainted with hiv the aids virus between 
1978 and 1984 better cleansing techniques eventually made factor 
viii free of hiv but by then thousands of hemophiliacs were 
already infected 
the national hemophilia foundation in new york now estimates 
that about 55 percent of the nations 20000 hemophiliacs carry 
hiv the uncertainty of when or if they will develop aids is a 
simple fact of life for these people 
about 1200 of the 125000 aids victims since the epidemic began 
have been hemophiliacs but those numbers are likely to grow 
perhaps substantially 
this is what scare us the most said alan brownstein 
executive director of the hemophilia foundation all of these 
people were infected at least six years ago as we learn more about 
the incubation period we know we are getting closer and closer to 
a time when even more people with hemophilia will get aids 
to help forestall this the drug azt is now recommended for 
infected hemophiliacs whose blood counts fall below a certain 
level however some doctors say that many outwardly well 
hemophiliacs are reluctant to begin routine treatment with this 
medicine 
in fact despite their high risk hemophiliacs often appear 
reluctant to face up to the possibility that they might die from 
aids brownstein said that in some parts of the country onethird 
of hemophiliacs have not been tested to see if they are infected 
some say this denial is simply another facet of going through 
life with a disease that makes routine chores and pleasures 
hazardous for people with severe hemophilia a fall or a cut can 
cause dangerous bleeding 
there are strong denial elements that exist for many 
hemophiliacs if they didnt have denial skills from early 
childhood they never would have taken the training wheels off 
their bikes said dr richard lipton of long island jewish 
hospital 
dr bruce furie of new england medical center in boston said 
some infected hemophiliacs seem to take comfort from the fact that 
physicians cannot tell them with 100 percent confidence that they 
will get aids 
they are living normal and productive lives he said they 
went through their crisis three or four years ago when they found 
out they were infected most of them are still going along with 
their activities but with the knowledge that they are playing 
russian roulette and dont know when or if the gun will go off 
making factor viii free of hiv was expensive and the cost of 
therapy has increased 10fold since the discovery of aids routine 
treatment of a patient with severe hemophilia can now range from 
50000 to 100000 a year

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
today there are indications the soviet union may be considering a 
referendum in lithuania as a way of shaping the future of the 
independenceminded baltic republic 
but baker also registered a degree of concern about the 
lithuanian situation as he prepared to begin three days of talks 
with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
baker is hoping shevardnadzes visit will produce a plan for a 
peaceful settlement in lithuania as well as a date for the next 
superpower summit meeting and progress on ussoviet arms control 
accords 
at the state department baker said lithuania will be at the 
very top of the issues we will be discussing talking to 
reporters after a meeting with west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher he said we are anxious to see these 
developments proceed peacefully and be resolved through dialogue 
baker was buoyed by the meeting alexandr n yakolev a close 
adviser to gorbachev held in moscow on tuesday with a delegation 
of officials from lithuania 
there would appear at least to be the beginnings of such a 
dialogue baker said we are encouraged as well that we see 
references coming from both sides to the concept of the possibility 
of some sort of a referendum approach 
a soviet foreign ministry official appearing on abctvs good 
morning america reaffirmed the kremlins pledge to deal with the 
secessionists in a peaceful way 
mr shevardnadze will certainly describe our attitude and 
reiterate our intention to work toward resolution of the situation 
through dialogue and in a peaceful manner said vitaly churkin 
an adviser to the foreign minister 
last thursday lithuanian leaders informed the kremlin they were 
ready to discuss the issue of a referendum on secession if 
gorbachev agreed to talk with them the soviet leader having 
demanded the nullification of a march 11 declaration of 
independence did not respond immediately 
but the meeting with yakolev indicated the two sides may be 
trying to find a way out of the impasse created by the declaration 
and gorbachevs refusal to accept it bakers remarks today 
suggested he shared in that judgment 
also on the agenda is the war in angola between the sovietarmed 
government and usaided rebels baker is trying for a ceasefire 
but insists on a commitment from the luanda government that it will 
share power with the unita guerrillas led by jonas savimbi 
before the opening round beginning late this afternoon us 
officials had no word on whether shevardnadze brought a reply from 
gorbachev to bushs letter last week reiterating us hopes for a 
peaceful settlement in lithuania 
but the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
they hoped gorbachev and shevardnadze would spell out how the 
soviets plan to come to grips with the secessionist movement in the 
baltic republic 
arriving here tuesday shevardnadze likened events in lithuania 
to an earthquake but he also pledged to engage in honest 
dialogue with the independence movement 
while the foreign ministers remarks had a conciliatory ring he 
also emphasized the importance the kremlin attaches to the soviet 
constitution and soviet laws 
you must understand the importance of that question for the 
soviet union and the soviet people shevardnadze said 
bush and baker have no intention of scrapping plans for the 
summit over lithuania officials said the selection of a precise 
date in june depends on the soviets scheduling a peoples congress 
in moscow the same month 
bush and gorbachev hope during the summit to sign an accord to 
limit their longrange nuclear missiles bombers and submarines 
however claims that the overall cutback would amount to 50 percent 
came under challenge on tuesday 
a senior administration official declining to be identified 
told the associated press the united states would wind up with only 
slightly fewer deployed warheads than in the current arsenals when 
warheads kept in storage are taken into account he said the us 
total actually would exceed the current level 
the official said that from the us standpoint the principal 
virtue of the treaty would be to force a reduction in longrange 
soviet ss18 missiles 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said the 
treaty would cut the ss18 force in half and also reduce the total 
of deployed soviet missiles by about half 
the treaty is based on equality she said reading from a 
statement since soviet force levels exceed our own in the most 
dangerous and destabilizing systems their reductions will be 
somewhat larger

president virgilio barco today said the 
leader of the medellin cocaine cartel will not be extradited to the 
united states if he turns himself in 
it was the first time barco had made such a promise to a drug 
trafficking suspect since he ordered a government crackdown on 
traffickers in august 
barco made the offer to the medellin leader pablo escobar in 
an interview with the colombian radio network rcn 
mr escobar has said that he is going to give himself up and 
i say that if he surrenders i guarantee the judges will judge him 
with complete impartiality barco said referring to colombian 
courts 
in the last seven months the barco government has extradited 15 
trafficking suspects to the united states 
like all other trafficking suspects escobar faces no drug 
charges in colombia he does face several murder charges including 
one for the slaying of a newspaper publisher guillermo cano 
cano was killed in a submachinegun attack in front of his 
bogota daily newspaper el espectador on dec 17 1987 the

a transplant of insulinproducing cells enabled 
a woman with diabetes to go without daily insulin injections for 
more than two weeks say researchers at washington university 
however after that period the womans body began to reject the 
transplant doctors said 
researchers david scharp and paul lacy said tuesday that the 
case was the first time transplanted cells temporarily eliminated 
the need for insulin injections in a patient with juvenileonset 
diabetes researchers previously had only been able to reduce the 
need for insulin they said 
the results were announced in the april issue of the journal 
diabetes 
the 36yearold patient was one of several given a pancreatic 
islet cell transplant during pilot clinical trials at washington 
university school of medicine and barnes hospital in st louis 
islets are pockets of hormoneproducing tissue that release 
insulin 
the transplanted cells injected into the patients liver were 
removed from the islets of two cadaver pancreases 
jay s skyler vice president of the american diabetes 
association and professor of medicine at the university of miami 
said the study was promising but he cautioned that it was only one 
step toward a cure 
we still have a ways to go skyler said now weve got to 
figure out why its only temporary 
skyler noted that researchers have been able to reverse diabetes 
in rodents using this procedure since 1972 but until now had been 
unsuccessful in applying it to humans 
its an exciting step one thats been elusive for a very long 
time skyler said it was almost getting to the point that many 
people were getting totally discouraged that the corner would ever 
be turned 
scharp also warned that it might be years before islet cell 
transplantation became a routine treatment for diabetics 
we are immensely pleased that the grafted tissue was able to 
satisfy all of the patients insulin requirements before it was 
rejected said scharp who conducted the transplant our first 
trials in 1985 were designed to determine that islet transplants 
were safe in this study our primary goal was to determine if we 
could isolate purify and transplant enough islets to bring a 
patient completely off of insulin 
within 10 days of the transplant the patient no longer required 
daily insulin injections according to hourly bloodsugar tests 
she remained independent of insulin until the 25th day when 
evidence of tissue rejection appeared and she began to require 
gradually increasing amounts of supplemental insulin 
the case shows that islet transplantation is a feasible 
approach to controlling insulindependent diabetes and clearly 
establishes the need to move on to larger clinical trials said 
lacy a pathologist at washington university who devised many of 
the techniques used to isolate and purify human islet cells 
lacy said the researchers hope to draw on previous research to 
find ways to combat rejection of the cells

mcdonalds and other fast food chains should 
give customers a break and reduce saturated fats in their products 
said fullpage ads placed today by a multimillionaire who lobbies 
against heartthreatening foods 
advertisements appeared in the wall street journal the new york 
times usa today and at least 10 other major newspapers 
proclaiming mcdonalds your hamburgers have too much fat 
phil sokolof an omaha businessman who has waged a oneman 
campaign against highly saturated fats in processed foods called 
on mcdonalds corp and other restaurants to reduce the fat content 
of their hamburger meat by 10 percent 
about five newspapers declined to run the ad sokolof said in an 
interview the ad singles out mcdonalds because it is the industry 
leader but burger king and wendys also use too much fat he said 
in an interview 
the los angeles times rejected the ad because it violates a 
policy of not accepting advertising that is a direct attack on 
another company or individual said laura morgan a spokeswoman for 
the newspaper 
mcdonalds reacted with outrage 
i think this kind of advertising is sensational ridiculous 
and i think its reckless mcdonalds senior vice president dick 
starmann said from oak brook ill 
im surprised that mcdonalds is singled out because over the 
years we are the ones who have led the way in reducing fats in our 
menus he said we think we have the leanest hamburger meat 
available today 
mcdonalds serves 22 million people a day and has 11000 
restaurants in 52 countries 
a burger king spokeswoman said sokolof praised that company four 
years ago when it began frying onion rings and fish in vegetable 
oil 
the only product that we use a combination of animal fat and 
vegetable oil is french fries because our customers say they prefer 
it that way cori zywotow said 
sokolof 67 blames high cholesterol for a nearfatal heart 
attack he suffered 24 years ago he started the national heart 
savers association in 1985 and it is supported largely through his 
own contributions 
after he launched a national advertising campaign in 1988 nine 
major food processors including nabisco kelloggs pepperidge 
farm and keebler agreed to begin phasing out cholestorolelevating 
fats from products such as crackers cookies candies cereals 
cooking ingredients and tv dinners 
todays advertisement said more than half of all americans have 
too much cholesterol in their blood and 25 percent have dangerously 
high levels 
it said a mcdonalds big mac with french fries contains 25 grams 
of saturated fat while a lean beef sandwich has only 3 grams of 
saturated fat 
starmann countered that a big mac with french fries contains 
about 19 grams of saturated fat mcdonalds uses a combination of 
beef tallow and vegetable shortening to cook its fries but is 
testing cholesterolfree vegetable shortening that would eliminate 
beef tallow he added

genecin asked 
five dollars apiece watkins replied 
watkins who left the group in 1987 testified at sharptons 
fraud trial in manhattan state supreme court 
a 67count indictment against sharpton alleges that he stole

dinner watkins said he would tell me thats my money and i 
do what i want with it 
under cross examination by defense attorney alton maddox 
watkins an administrative assistant at the army recruitment 
division said he joined the movement in late 1985 and faded 
away in early 1987 
he said he was paid 75 a week or about 4500 in all but did 
not report the income on his tax returns he denied that he was 
promised leniency in exchange for his testimony 
watkins disputed sharptons claims that the national youth 
movements 20000 members provided antidrug rallies voter 
registration drives and employment services through 15 offices 
nationwide 
watkins testified that he knew of no members outside about 10 
staff people and of no office other than one at st marys hospital 
in brooklyn

soviet and lithuanian officials were heartened 
today by a more than threehour meeting of representatives of the 
breakaway republic and a top aide to soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
the soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri d gremitskikh 
called the meeting tuesday night between a lithuanian delegation 
and alexander yakovlev a progressive member of the presidential 
council and the communist party politburo a positive sign 
it was the first highlevel contact between lithuania and the 
kremlin since the day after the republic declared itself 
independent march 11 
i think its very important that lithuanian representatives 
are aware of the ideas and thoughts that are held here in moscow 
gremitskikh told reporters at a briefing today our colleagues in 
lithuania just have to tear themselves away from their narrow views 
and look at all these problems through the prism of the fact that a 
new basis for the federation is being created 
in a separate news conference ivan d laptev the new head of 
the soviet of the union one of two chambers of the soviet 
legislature said im convinced there will be a successful 
dialogue 
a decision will be found that will be satisfactory to both 
sides said laptev the progressive editor of izvestia 
lithuanian legislator egidijus bickauskas said of the meeting 
we are very very encouraged 
if there are people who at least want to listen to us its 
very good bickauskas said 
the clash of wills over lithuanian independence has included an 
order from gorbachev for lithuanians to relinquish all weapons the 
arrest by soviet troops of some lithuanian deserters the takeover 
of several vilnius buildings by soviet soldiers movements of army 
reinforcements and a sharp war of words 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze was in washington 
for talks with president bush and secretary of state james a baker 
iii and said the kremlin intended to hold honest dialogue with 
the lithuanians 
an expected meeting this morning with soviet interior minister 
vadim bakatin did not occur according to a spokeswoman for the 
lithuanian office in moscow she was unable to say if it had been 
canceled or postponed 
the lithuanian legislature which began meeting in the late 
afternoon was scheduled to respond today to gorbachevs decree 
that the republic renounce its declaration of independence before 
any talks begin 
suggestions by some lithuanian communists that the small baltic 
nation suspend its declaration of independence for six months in 
hopes of appeasing gorbachev were adamantly opposed by members of 
the sajudis proindependence movement according to anatole lieven 
of the times of london one of the few correspondents not expelled 
from vilnius by soviet authorities 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis and the overwhelming 
majority of lithuanian citizens interviewed by the associated press 
over the past two weeks said soviet military intimidation had not 
ebbed their determination for independence 
if somebody expects lithuania to renounce its independence 
act there will be no such answer bickauskas said 
sajudis planned proindependence rallies in several lithuanian 
cities tonight but spokesman yuri romanenko said one scheduled for 
vilnius was canceled to prevent a clash with an antiindependence 
meeting set for the same spot in front of the parliament building 
90 minutes earlier 
as with earlier antiindependence demonstrations in the 
lithuanian capital publicity was handled by the soviet army which 
dropped announcements from a military helicopter on tuesday 
romanenko said 
gremitskikh also said today that soviet officials had never 
halted their dialogue with lithuanians and he specifically cited a 
visit to vilnius by several members of the national parliament 
the only such trip was taken by a group of democratically minded 
deputies who strongly supported lithuanias bid for independence 
and called on gorbachev to end his intransigence and start 
negotiating 
on tuesday the supreme soviet parliament approved a bill 
setting procedures for secession from the soviet union the soviet 
constitution allows republics to secede but until the legislation 
was passed there was no legal mechanism for beginning the procedure 
the law which becomes effective when it is published in the 
soviet press requires twothirds of a republics voters to approve 
secession in a referendum and calls for a subsequent waiting period 
of up to five years while the soviet union and the republic 
negotiate terms of secession 
bickauskas said lithuania had no means of implementing its 
proclaimed independence if soviet soldiers continued to interfere 
in the republic 
we have declared independence but we very well know that 
tanks are moving on our soil every day and night and they take 
over one building after another he said 
we realize the soviet union has economic political and 
military interests in lithuania that cannot be cut all at once 
these problems involve not only the soviet union and lithuania but 
europe and the whole world so we need to talk we want somebody to 
hold a dialogue with us bickauskas said 
on saturday gorbachev said secession talks could take place if 
lithuania renounced the independence declaration landsbergis 
responded monday that lithuania did not intend to rush toward 
freedom and invited a moscow representative for talks in vilnius

west german foreign minister hans dietrich 
genscher opened a round of meetings with top us officials today 
rejecting a soviet proposal to neutralize a reunited germany 
emerging from a meeting at the state department with secretary 
of state james a baker iii genscher repeated his nations stand 
that a unified germany should remain a partner in the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
a neutralized germany would not contribute to stability in 
europe he said on the contrary it would increase 
instability 
we want to see german unification making a contribution to 
stability in europe he said 
baker then escorted genscher to the white house for a meeting 
with president bush 
genscher and baker told reporters that the timing of the 
socalled twoplusfour meetings on german unification depend on 
the organization of the east german government following its recent 
national elections 
the participants in the negotiations include both german nations 
plus the four nations that emerged victorious after world war ii 
the united states britain france and the soviet union 
the formula still under discussion is a device to compromise the 
soviets initial demand for neutralization of its world war ii 
enemy and to allay concerns among germanys neighbors who sufffered 
devastation at the hands of the nazis 
genscher has taken the lead in promoting the continuation of a 
unified germany in nato with a concession to the soviet union that 
western troops would not be moved into what is now east germany 
the west german foreign minister offered his governments thanks 
to the united states for its support of the german unification 
process 
he said west germany is determined that the process proceed with 
full openness and with complete consultation with his nations 
allies and neighbors 
we dont want to act behind the backs of others genscher 
said 
we are interested in and we intend to see german unification 
making a contribution to civility in western europe he said 
baker said he and genscher discussed a wide range of issues 
including the problems posed by german unification conventional 
arms control and the possibility of a 35nation summit meeting this 
year as proposed by soviet presidzent mikhail s gorbachev 
the bush administration already has endorsed the summit idea 
but only if a treaty now being negotiated between nato and the 
warsaw pact to reduce troops tanks and other nonnuclear weapons 
in europe is ready for signing

approved the distribution of chlorine bleach for cleaning needles 
to slow the spread of aids among intravenous drug users 
the council vote was unanimous tuesday after an emotional 
hearing in which one unidentified man was escorted from chambers 
when he tried to shout down supporters of the program 
the 25000 allocated for distribution of kits containing bleach 
and condoms was part of an 85000 aids prevention and education 
program the bleach kills the aids virus on needles which drug 
addicts often share 
the money also establishes a central aids treatment and 
information center 
san francisco is the only other governmental agency in 
california that distributes bleach to clean needles new york also 
distributes bleach and recently withdrew from a program to 
distribute clean needles 
critics of the programs charge they promote drug abuse 
supporters say drug abuse will continue regardless of whether 
needles are sterilized to prevent aids 
dave johnson the citys aids policy and program coordinator 
estimated that 7 percent of intravenous drug users in los angeles 
county carry the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
the city administrative office said the 25000 will pay for 
50000 to 62000 bleach and condom kits city officials said they

today on charges that he conspired with a city councilman to extort 
payoffs from developers in exchange for approving zoning changes on 
properties 
gov bob martinez on tuesday suspended both martinez and 
councilman andres mejides without pay after they were indicted by a 
federal grand jury following a fiveyear investigation into the 
operation of the states fifthlargest city 
these are extremely serious charges that go to the very 
essence of trust in government and the people of hialeah deserve 
to know that their officials have the publics best interest in 
mind at all times said the governor who is not related to the 
mayor until these charges can be resolved these two officials 
should not hold their positions of trust 
both city officials and were scheduled to appear this afternoon 
before a federal magistrate 
martinez obtained benefits including money and property for 
himself and others by expressly using and threatening to use the 
powers of his office as mayor of the city of hialeah the 
indictment said 
raul martinez 41 was named in two racketeer influenced corrupt 
organization counts along with seven extortionrelated counts and 
faces a maximum 180 years in prison and fines of 225 million 
said marcella cohen first assistant us attorney 
keep the faith and at the end i am going to prevail because i 
am innocent raul martinez said in a message to constituents 
tuesday 
mejides 51 also was named in the two racketeering counts 
along with four counts of obtaining property by extortion and 
faces maximum penalties of 120 years and fines of 15 million 
the government also claims that martinez must forfeit 900000 
in property and cash that he allegedly obtained from racketeering 
activities mejides must forfeit 24000 in property the 
government said 
city council president julio martinez who is not related to 
either the governor or suspended mayor was sworn in late tuesday 
as acting mayor 
former city council candidates paulino nunez and evelio medina 
who were the highest unelected votegetters in the last city 
election were sworn in to fill the resulting council vacancies 
the indictment tuesday also named several other current and 
former hialeah officials as unindicted coconspirators the 
indictment charges that between 1981 and 1987 half of the citys 
eight elected officials repeatedly shook down developers and 
builders seeking to rezone property in hialeah 
raul martinez has been mayor of the predominantly hispanic 
workingclass city of more than 200000 residents since 1981 he 
was handily reelected to a fifth term in november after a campaign 
in which opponents raised the issue of his real estate dealings 
the mayor replied that he had been under federal scrutiny for 
years but apparently without any finding of wrongdoing he has 
charged the investigations were politically motivated

march 30 
el paso texas heraldpost on child care 
george bush has promised to veto any childcare bill that 
discriminates against religious or churchbased day care his 
forthright commitment emboldens us to hope that good sense will 
prevail on this contentious issue despite the inscrutable ways of 
congress 
purists on the separation of church and state see this as a 
matter of principle let a tax dollar flow to a religious 
childcare center and calvins geneva is just around the corner 
in fact the use of childcare vouchers to pay for religious 
care would no more threaten the first amendment than the hugely 
successful gi bill which covered veterans costs at public and 
sectarian colleges alike 
if even a fraction of eligible parents find in church 
congregations an extended family to help nurture their children 
should the government discourage them 
whatever childcare bill emerges from the house of 
representatives vote the white house should scrutinize the process 
of reconciling house and senate versions bush should restate his 
insistence that parents have a right to choose religious day care 
and follow up his pledge with a veto if need be

the clarionledger jackson miss on the sampl bailout 
while some of the nations observers are running around saying 
what are we going to do about sampl failures and bailouts 
several congressmen are doing something about it they have 
introduced legislation to limit compensation packages at federally 
insured depository institutions 
enacting this one relatively minor adjustment could save 
taxpayers a substantial sum 
in some cases the failure of financial institutions is attended 
by bailouts for high officers perhaps the best example is the top 
management of drexel burnham lambert inc a wall street securities 
firm which handed out some 350 million in bonuses just before 
filing for bankruptcy 
creditors rather than taxpayers were hurt by that payoff but 
the potential is there for institutions backed by federally insured 
deposits the proposed legislation would limit such golden 
parachutes at those institutions 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman william siedman told a 
house subcommittee that his agency needs more authority to prevent 
excessive compensation at weakened institutions that are still 
operating 
the fdic should be given all the authority it needs to protect 
taxpayers and then congress and the president should make sure it 
uses it effectively toward that end

for years the simple wisdom of conserving something that is in 
limited supply escaped america 
it was too complex for ronald reagan his administration was 
determined to foil a 1975 law mandating higher fuelefficiency 
standards 
thanks to white house clout and reagans backward thinking the 
standard congress originally planned for 1985model fleets wasnt 
in place until the 1990model cars 
the victory went to detroit lobbyists the loss went to a nation 
that is increasingly dependent on imported oil and increasingly 
swaddled in air pollution it was a commitment to waste in a world 
that must learn to conserve finite sources of energy and develop 
renewable ones 
corporate average fuel economy standards had a beneficial effect 
despite the best efforts of ronald reagan and the detroit lobby 
higher standards kept 360 million tons of carbon dioxide out of the 
air just in 1989 according to the sierra club 
higher fuelefficiency standards are like finding an oil well 
they save resources and blunt arguments about how the nation must 
sacrifice every wilderness for the sake of oil exploration they 
reduce both pollution and the need for oil imports for consumers 
they could lower operating costs or at least help offset the 
higher gas taxes looming on the horizon 
there isnt room in an environmentally conscious nation for any 
more coddling of automakers who cling to outofdate ideas 
congress has to look out for the best interests of the nation 
and provide a real incentive for car makers to offer truly 
efficient cars higher fuelefficiency standards are a simple easy 
strategy in a nation that needs to remember that conservation means 
more than just doing without

statesman journal salem ore on water shortages 
as the state enters its fourth drought year california 
officials have imposed new mandatory conservation rules to preserve 
water the rainy season is about over and snowpack levels are at 
less than 63 percent of normal 
although california makes the headlines it shares with east 
coast states and big cities in texas and arizona and new mexico a 
problem that goes beyond a few drought years the problem is that 
population and wasteful lifestyles are using up in a few years 
aquifer water reservoirs that took thousands of years to fill 
in some areas sucking up the pure underground water to drink 
fill swimming pools irrigate crops flush toilets wash cars has 
created a vacuum that allowed sea water to seep into the aquifer 
thus even the diminishing supply of good water is contaminated 
misuses of water and excessive population growth have disturbed 
political stability in many areas of the world the most volatile 
is the middle east where the scramble for more water has upset an 
already unstable region 
no single approach will solve the impending water crisis 
holding down the rate of population growth is critical so are new 
irrigation techniques a new subsidy policy that discourages 
irrigation for crops that can be grown elsewhere and incentives 
and penalties that encourage citizens and industry to conserve

chinas legislature gave final approval today to 
the basic law by which beijing will govern hong kong after 1997 
but hong kong politicians immediately demanded it be amended 
the national peoples congress which largely rubberstamps 
decisions by top leaders made no changes of its own in the law 
which was thrashed out over the past five years by a special 
chinesehong kong committee 
under the law hong kong which has been ruled by britain since 
1842 is promised a high degree of autonomy within china and 
protection of its capitalist economic system for at least 50 years 
however many of hong kongs 57 million residents fear the 
guarantees are not strong enough and they already are emigrating 
to escape coming under communist rule 
the law provides for a 60seat local legislature in which 20 
members could be directly elected at first 24 members in 1999 and 
30 members in the year 2003 it also sets up a complicated 
splitvoting procedure that gives appointed legislators power to 
veto controversial bills 
after hong kong residents loudly supported last years massive 
prodemocracy protests on the mainland china added provisions for 
declaring a state of emergency in hong kong and banned subversive 
activities and contacts between hong kong and foreign political 
groups 
hong kong residents greeted the drafts publication in february 
with protests and demands for greater democracy 
the colonys legislature voted 206 today to ask china to change 
the law before 1997 chinas national peoples congress must 
approve any changes 
hong kong legislator martin lee an outspoken proponent of 
democratic reforms said the law as passed was a regression 
from earlier versions because of the antisubversion clauses 
chinese leaders have said repeatedly they will not allow hong kong 
to become a base for chinese dissident activity 
tens of thousands of hong kong residents already have emigrated 
because of fear about life under communist rule and the pace has 
stepped up sharply since china used its army in june to crush the 
prodemocracy protests a survey in august found that two out of 
every five residents want to leave 
chinas senior leader deng xiaoping however has praised the 
basic law as a masterpiece of creativity that can ensure 
stability after 1997 he said general elections and western 
democracy were not suitable for hong kong 
the national peoples congress which approved the basic law by 
a vote of 2660 to 16 with 29 abstentions and eight deputies 
failing to vote also decided to set up a 400member joint hong 
kongmainland committee to prepare for the 1997 transfer

winstonsalem nc journal on the idaho abortion bill 
abortion activists tossed gov cecil andrus of idaho a hot 
potato by threatening a boycott of the states most famous crop 
if he didnt veto a bill that would have given that state the 
nations most restrictive abortion law 
the governor a longtime abortion foe caved in he claimed 
the veto reflected his objection to the laws harsh provisions on 
rape cases and its unlikely prospects before the supreme court the 
risk of ruining his states economy must also have played a part 
however 
theres no question that abortion is both a wrenching moral 
issue and a legitimate subject for political debate but some of 
the tactics employed by zealots on either side of the issue 
threaten to go beyond free speech or even civil disobedience they 
threaten to undermine the democratic process 
in the last two presidential races candidates for the nations 
highest office have faced a constant barrage of heckling and 
disruption from abortion foes now that the webster decision has 
transferred much of the action to the state level political 
discourse is being held hostage in state races 
those involved in the issue argue that the fate of some crop is 
small potatoes alongside the lives of women or the deaths of the 
unborn but that misses the point 
no matter how important the abortion issue is to those caught up 
in it the tactic in idaho threatened to ruin the livelihoods if 
not the lives of potato farmers they were innocent bystanders who 
had no connection to the debate other than the accident of 
depending for their income on a product that could be turned into a 
convenient symbol 
a tactic that attempts to make a political point by ruining the 
lives and fortunes of victims selected more or less at random isnt 
democracy in action or noble protest its a species of terrorism

it also notes that these deaths could be prevented at low cost 
if the nations of the world have the will to address the problem a 
host of proposals that unicef says could save millions of lives a 
year would come with a 25 billion annual price tag the figure is 
equivalent to what soviets spend on vodka what american companies 
spend on cigarette advertisement in a year and 10 percent of the

akron ohio beacon journal on the nuclear threat 
the threat of war between the united states and the soviet union 
has diminished but not the threat to world order from other 
sources 
a reminder of that came with the arrest in britain of six 
people who were trying to smuggle a triggering device for nuclear 
weapons into iraq 
this is the new world threat as tensions ease between the big 
powers the increasing spread of weapons of increasing 
destructiveness can mean that regional conflicts will be 
international concerns or that smaller terrorist nations can hold 
large powers hostage on their demands 
it is time to put tighter controls on the spread of nuclear 
weapons technology and to expand and enforce nuclear proliferation

beloit wis daily news on japan and the us economy 
according to a japanese newspaper a list of 80 suggestions to 
improve the united states economy has been delivered from tokyo to 
washington 
the japanese suggest the united states impose a valueadded tax 
abolish income tax deductions on home mortgage loans build 
highspeed trains to reduce the demand for automobiles and even 
limit the number of credit cards us citizens can possess 
the object is to cut the multibilliondollar us trade deficit 
with japan 
the united states isnt a basket case just yet and doesnt need 
lectures from the land of the rising sun 
the japanese flush with the economic success of recent years 
shouldnt forget just how dependent their industries are on the 
american marketplace presumptuous pronouncements of this type just 
feed an existing american resentment of japanese economic policies 
it also glosses over a key point in the trade deficit situation 
namely tokyos protectionist policies which thwart us companies 
efforts to compete in japan 
there may come a day when tokyo has the economic power to humble 
the united states and dictate fiscal policies but dont bet on it

imelda marcos lawyer says the real estate deals 
that led to fraud and racketeering charges against her were 
originally suggested by george bush and that the cia knew all 
about them 
defense attorney gerald spence also announced in opening 
arguments at mrs marcos trial tuesday that he will try to call 
president bush as a witness and will seek a sworn statement from 
philippine president corazon aquino 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
refused to comment on spences allegations 
a lawyer for mrs marcos codefendant saudi arabian arms 
dealer adnan khashoggi said today in his opening statement that 
his client had committed foolish acts in his business dealings 
but was innocent of fraud charges 
if this wasnt such a serious charge this would be funny 
james linn said in opening arguments it is not the sinister 
thing that the government makes it out to be 
linn admitted that khashoggi had many personal dealings with 
marcos and that khashoggi had signed one fake document involving 
the buildings but said this was intended to help a marcos 
associate not to defraud anyone 
khashoggi 54 once described as the richest man in the world 
was trying to head off moves by creditors to foreclose on the 
properties linn said 
on tuesday a prosecutor portrayed mrs marcos as an 
uncontrolled spender who treated the philippine national bank as 
her personal piggy bank 
the former philippine first lady and her husband ferdinand 
were indicted in 1988 on charges of stealing millions of dollars 
from their homelands treasury to buy new york city real estate 
jewelry and art marcos died in exile in hawaii in september 
mrs marcos 60 broke down in tears as spence described her as 
a devoted wife determined to clear the name of her late husband 
he denied that mrs marcos had any part in the dealings on which 
the charges are based mrs marcos never wrote a check in her 
life she never paid a bill in her life spence told the jury 
spence sought to trace the origins of the new york real estate 
deals to cia concern in the early 1980s that the philippines 
would fall to the communists 
according to spence bush then vice president visited manila 
in 1981 and urged marcos to abandon negotiations with libyan leader 
moammar gadhafi on an oil investment deal and put the money instead 
into american property 
the evidence in this case is that the cia was aware of every 
transaction that took place in this case spence said 
earlier assistant us attorney debra livingston charged that 
the marcoses were partners in crime who used accomplices fake 
documents and 13 shell corporations to steal 168 million in 
philippine government funds and defraud us banks of 165 million 
more she said the couple used some of the money to buy four 
expensive pieces of new york real estate and other luxury items 
she said mrs marcos treated the new york branch of the 
philippine national bank as her own personal piggy bank every 
time she descended on new york she cracked it open taking 
bundles and bundles of cash 
livingston said khashoggi 54 entered the picture after mrs 
aquino replaced marcos in 1986 and her government won a us court 
order to prohibit any further transactions involving the four 
buildingss 
khashoggi she said committed fraud and obstructed justice by 
fabricating documents showing that he not the marcoses had owned 
the buildings for several years 
if convicted mrs marcos could get up to 50 years in prison and 
a 1 million fine khashoggi once described as the worlds richest 
man could receive up to 10 years in prison and a 500000 fine if 
convicted 
spence said mrs marcos never lost sight of her humble origins 
she was beloved by the people he said if she took 30 
minutes to dress for a head of state she took an hour to dress for 
the little people 
spence said mrs marcos had been unfairly treated for having had 
more than 1000 pairs of shoes left behind in manila 
one thing that made up this woman is how long she was 
barefoot he said he added however that most of the shoes were 
given to her by local shoe manufacturers and most of them didnt 
fit

the general medical council took disciplinary 
action wednesday against three doctors involved in a case in which 
four healthy people sold their kidneys for transplant operations 
the harshest action was taken against dr raymond crockett the 
council struck him from its register meaning he may not prescribe 
medicine until he is readmitted to the register he is eligible to 
reapply in 10 months 
the councils professional conduct committee found crockett and 
surgeons michael joyce and michael bewick guilty of serious 
professional misconduct but crockett was the only one struck off 
the register 
joyce and bewick were found to have failed to comply with 
guidelines on making checks on the histories of the patients and 
donors 
joyce was banned from taking part in kidney transplants for two 
years 
bewick was ordered to confine his services to the governments 
national health service for the next three years and to submit 
detailed records of every transplant operation in which he is 
involved 
they have 28 days to appeal 
this whole case has been about the limits to which it is 
permissible for a doctor to go to save lives thats all i have 
ever tried to do crockett said after the hearing my concern 
was with four of my patients who were going to die without an 
urgent transplant 
the committee chairman sir robert kilpatrick told crockett his 
conduct brought disgrace upon yourself and dishonor upon medical 
practice in the united kingdom 
during a 35day hearing the board heard allegations that 
crockett arranged for kidneys to be transplanted from four healthy 
turks into patients in london 
turkish authorities said the donors were paid 3200 to 5600 
ata nur kunter who has been identified as the broker in the 
transactions was not called to testify 
everybody knows if you have money you can buy a kidney 
kunter said in an interview wednesday with press association 
britains domestic news agency 
the gmc obviously dont want to hear my story and i have 
always suspected that there must be a reason kunter said 
the gmc accuses me of being a kidney broker and of lying and 
none of it is true kunter added 
a spokesman for the medical council who was not identified 
said the committee had been advised by attorneys that it would be 
inappropriate to call kunter to testify 
kunter introduced the four donors ahmet koc ferhat usta 
natice anutkan and coskun yenici to crockett and said crockett 
paid him to act as an interpreter 
four willing turkish donors were presented to me and were 
fully assessed as fit and willing to give one of their kidneys 
crockett said the general medical council found all these donors 
freely consented 
crockett said he believed his actions were correct right 
before my patients and right before my peers 
i believe the question of money was largely irrelevant 
crockett said and i do not accept in any regard that i was 
guilty of misconduct in any form

the albuquerque nm tribune on lithuania 
in shaping a response to the soviet unions secession crisis 
george bush has wisely avoided the mistake of excessive 
interference but his moderation leads him to err in the opposite 
direction 
bush has been so discreet in expressing sympathy for the cause 
of lithuanian independence that one would hardly guess he endorses 
the american policy of 50 years standing that the soviet unions 
forcible annexation of the baltic states lithuania estonia and 
latvia through a secret deal with hitler was never legal 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev says he is committed to 
transforming his government into one based on law and consent if 
so president bush will do no harm by reiterating what our country 
has always stood for 
the brave lithuanians suffered foreign domination for 50 years 
now they have elected a parliament that voted unanimously for 
independence their government is acting with dignity in their 
vastly unequal faceoff with the soviet union they deserve the 
moral support of the united states

the los angeles times on capital punishment 
a few minutes after 3 am tuesday in the darkest watch of the 
night the penalty imposed long ago for robert harris callous 
murder of two teenage boys finally would have been carried out 
but mondays decision by the us supreme court to uphold a stay 
granted by the court of appeals stopped the clock at least for 
now at 1 minute to 3 
for more than 20 years california has kept a kind of death 
watch of its own those who favor capital punishment as 78 
percent of californians do and those who oppose it as the times 
does have waged a wrenching often bitter struggle over this 
divisive issue 
but had this scheduled execution gone forward what would 
have been accomplished beyond robert harris death the two young 
men he murdered will not be returned to life nor will the hearts 
of their families and friends be made whole 
would others have been deterred from murder by this killers 
execution according to a global survey of capital punishment 
conducted in 1988 by the united nations the evidence as a whole 
gives no positive support to the deterrence hypothesis that is 
one reason among many why no other western democracy maintains an 
active death sentence 
finally all that can be said is that life dealt cruelly with 
robert alton harris that he dealt cruelly with others and that the 
state may yet deal cruelly with him reasonable people will differ 
on whether there is any justice in that but none can say there is 
either goodness or mercy

the jury will remain out for some time on president george

victory in the great broccoli debate 
no the president hasnt swayed the nation to his side in hating 
the bouquetlike vegetable in fact the broccoli consortium that 
delivered five tons of the veggie to washington claims that bushs 
stink about being fed broccoli every time he boards air force one 
has actually made the veggie more popular in recent days 
that was the first part of bushs trilogy of victory another 
part is that those five tons of broccoli is going to feed dcs 
hungry the final part is the gem that this nonnews story has 
become polls show that bush beginning his second year in the oval 
office already is as popular as any president in us history his 
lighthearted approach with the able assistance of the equally 
popular first lady only increase his approval among voters 
indeed bush has turned the great broccoli debate into a public

negotiators for el salvador and the leftist rebels 
opened unmediated peace talks today and signed a declaration 
saying a truce in the nations 10yearold civil war is their 
initial objective 
the accord said the parties would try to end the armed 
conflict through political means as speedily as possible 
the declaration also said the negotiators hoped to promote moves 
toward democracy and respect for human rights in el salvador and 
toward integrating the guerrillas of the farabundo marti national 
liberation front into society 
the document also was signed by un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar who held brief separate meetings with the two 
sides today 
todays session the first peace talks on el salvador since 
october was the first time the united nations has sponsored such 
negotiations 
the civil war has killed 72000 people since 1980 
the two sides also agreed on the format for future talks 
they can either be facetoface negotiations mediated by perez 
de cuellar or his personal representative or involve un envoy 
bargaining separately with government and rebel delegations 
according to the accord 
the simple fact of agreeing on the procedure for the 
realization of the negotiating process is a considerable advance 
alvaro de soto perez de cuellars special envoy told reporters 
negotiators for el salvador and the rebels shook hands before 
signing the accord at todays public ceremony de soto later talked 
with the two sides to discuss procedures for the negotiations un 
officials said 
the parties then adjourned no date or location for the next 
session of talks was announced the teams were led by el salvadors 
justice minister oscar santamaria and rebel commander shafik 
handal 
de soto has been working to resume a dialogue between the 
government and the rebels since president alfredo cristiani of el 
salvador met with perez de cuellar in new york in february 
negotiations between the two sides were last held in october 
they were suspended after a union headquarters was bombed in 
november and the rebels opened an offensive in san salvador in 
which more than 1000 people died 
the agreement to resume peace talks came at a time of rising 
hopes for peace in central america 
chances for ending the el salvador conflict got a boost with the 
defeat five weeks ago of the leftwing sandinista government in 
nicaragua which has channeled weapons from cuba to the rebels 
according to us officials 
cristianis rightist government also has been hurt by falling 
prices for coffee a major export and a drop in us economic aid 
handal said the unsponsored dialogue must include issues such 
as restructuring the army and police judicial reforms and the 
reform of el salvadors electoral system 
we are optimistic now because these negotiations are in the 
framework of the united nations the rebel leader told a news 
conference this gives them a greater degree of seriousness and 
weight than in the past 
the salvadoran rebels in an open letter to this weeks summit 
of central american leaders in nicaragua proposed a plebiscite on 
constitutional reform to reduce the size of the countrys armed 
forces 
the proposed reform would also purge the military of rightwing 
elements and subject it to civilian authority 
the rebels urged that the plebiscite be held jointly with the 
1991 elections for a new national assembly in el salvador the 
letter said the rebels were willing to become peaceful political 
parties if an agreement was reached

despite the collapse of communism 
elsewhere in europe greek communists are hoping to share power in 
an alliance with the socialists after elections sunday 
the most recent polls predict the communistled coalition of the 
left and progress will win 105 percent of the vote down from 11 
percent it scored in november elections 
the conservative new democracy party is expected to remain at 46 
percent and the panhellenic socialist movement or pasok at 40 
percent 
if the conservatives fail to win a majority in the 300member 
parliament the communists may be able to share power again as 
they have for the last 10 months 
they teamed up with the conservatives after inconclusive 
elections in june and then with the socialists in an allparty 
government in november meanwhile communist regimes in eastern 
europe were being toppled in popular revolutions 
the greek people will not judge us because of the myths that 
existed in eastern european countries said mimis androulakis 
the communist partys key strategist and reformer they have 
judged us by our decades of struggle for democracy and progress in 
greece 
the greek communists were outlawed from 1947 to 1974 and 
political scientist mihalis spourdalakis says this may have saved 
them 
in greece the communist left has always been identified with 
the struggle for civil rights for parliamentary democracy on the 
other hand we have had an authoritarian anticommunist tradition 
communism is therefore not identified with authoritarianism but 
rather with progress he said 
menia mendrinou a longtime communist party organizer said the 
partys supporters may have been numbed by events in eastern 
europe but they wont vote for any other party they still believe 
that the party will protect their interests 
the communists contend that their jettisoning of the hammer and 
sickle emblem when they formed the coalition in march 1989 and 
their alliance with the conservatives in june were precursors of 
broader changes elsewhere 
we knocked down the walls before they were knocked down in 
europe communist party secretarygeneral grigoris farakos is 
fond of saying 
opponents however believe that it is this ideological 
disintegration that has damaged the communists 
the coalition of the left and progress was formed in march 1989 
comprising the communist party dissidents who had left the party 
and some former supporters of the socialists 
the coalition is going through a crisis of policy said 
angelos hagios a prominent communist party member who broke away 
after the party joined with the conservatives in june these 
contradictions working first with new democracy then with both 
then with pasok show a lack of independent leftist policy 
even androulakis who is hoping to retain his parliamentary seat 
in the port city of piraeus acknowledges the party has a fight 
ahead of it he points out that a slight drop in popularity could 
cost the coalition some of the 21 seats it has in parliament and 
its strength as a power broker 
hagios a candidate for the newly formed leftist popular 
opposition believes his party may win a seat in parliament at the 
coalitions expense 
pollster panayote dimitras expects the communists may be further 
damaged by a burgeoning environmentalist movement the 
environmentalists may improve on the one seat they won in november 
attracting voters who blame the three major parties for the 
10month political stalemate 
if they win a second or third seat everything changes they 
become the key to power dimitras said 
a recent decision by the coalition to field joint candidates 
with the socialists in five constituencies has led to heated 
protests from some supporters the move may block a new democracy 
majority in parliament by denying it of two of the three seats it 
holds in these areas 
opponents of the joint candidacies say it is incomprehensible 
that the communists cooperate with socialists the 
conservativecommunist coalition indicted former premier andreas 
papandreou and members of his eightyear socialist administration 
on corruption charges last year 
the communists counter that a new democracy government would 
change the electoral law in favor of larger parties closing the 
door on further coalition governments they also say it would adopt 
strict austerity measures in a bid to revive the economy 
analysts however point out that the communists are already in 
danger of losing their reason to exist they have recently accepted 
greeces role in the european community after seeing the former 
communist states of eastern europe seek ties with the ec 
people will soon be voting communist only for sentimental 
reasons said spourdalakis

they may not chomp on pizza and fight teenage 
hoods but they do live in new york citys sewers dankdwelling 
snapping turtles have been pulled out from sewage treatment plants 
their diets sometimes consist of cold cuts 
some of the turtles recovered from the bronx and manhattan 
plants have weighed 50 pounds or more according to tina casey a 
spokeswoman for the citys department of environmental protection 
theyre big enough to do serious damage to any hoodlum she 
said but not quite the size of the characters of the new hit 
movie teenage mutant ninja turtles 
the last time any of the big snappers came out of a new york 
sewer was 1988 when two were found lean mean and on screens 
intended to sift tree limbs and other large objects from sewage 
casey said periodically younger snapping turtles or other 
smaller breeds are found 
workers at the bronx screening station have kept a few of the 
greenishbrown reptiles around as pets feeding them cold cuts and 
meatballs she said 
when a monster turtle surfaces the department has the 
american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals take it 
to upstate new york and set it free but they have to be handled 
carefully the turtles powerful jaws can easily put a nasty 
dent in your body casey said 
casey ran across the sewer turtles existence two years ago 
while researching the mythical blind albino alligators that dont 
inhabit the city sewers after supposedly being flushed down 
toilets while the sewers are too cold and too sparse of alligator 
food they seem to be all right for freshwater turtles she said 
alligators look tougher but turtles really know how to 
survive in new york she said theyre real new yorkers 
two theories about how the turtles got into the sewer system get 
the most credence at the department one suggests they are 
backwashed into outlet pipes from the bronx river or maybe the 
east river casey said the other is that the turtles hatch in 
ponds at the bronx zoo or central park zoo and crawl out to find 
their way into the sewer system 
besides turtles eels pythons and other creatures have shown up 
in the citys sewage 
look for them if they make a sequel

mikhail s gorbachev phoned the 
president of estonia today and sharply criticized the baltic 
republics drive for independence estonian media reported 
arnold ruutel president of estonias supreme soviet parliament 
told official television that gorbachev used strong words and was 
generally very angry during the conversation 
in a later radio interview ruutel said gorbachev criticized 
estonias supreme soviet for declaring the republic an occupied 
state 
when i heard of your resolution i was completely beside 
myself you must declare the resolution null and void it is an 
invalid one ruutel quoted gorbachev as saying 
it seems to me that i have to introduce similar measures as 
those taken in lithuania he quoted the soviet leader as saying 
ruutel did not elaborate on those remarks when asked by the radio 
interviewer 
soviet soldiers and tanks moved into lithuania after officials 
in the republic refused to back down on their claim of 
independence but moscow has repeatedly said it would not use force 
there 
ruutel said that after he explained estonias position and that 
it would not give up its desire for independence the soviet 
president calmed down the television report said without 
elaboration 
no further details were available from the reported phone 
conversation 
estonia said last week it would seek to reestablish 
independence at the end of a stillundefined transition period but 
unlike their baltic neighbors in lithuania the estonians are 
taking a more careful line on secession and have called on moscow 
to start negotiations 
the estonian parliaments deputy speaker marju lauristin one 
of the leaders of the peoples front political movement said she 
was pleased with the conversation despite its beginning 
in spie of this first negative reaction it is a contact and 
every contact is needed for negotiations she said 
lauristin said gorbachev demanded from ruutel a full report on 
the situation in estonia she said the report was being prepared 
and would be sent to the soviet president as soon as possible 
gorbachevs call followed appeals from nonestonian 
nationalities to moscow to protect the rights of soviet citizens in 
the republic 
estonia declared support for lithuanias march 11 declaration of 
independence and called on gorbachev in a parliament resolution to 
halt army pressure and stop political provocations against 
lithuania 
the baltic republics of lithuania estonia and latvia were 
independent from the end of world war i until soviet annexation in 
1940 
meanwhile edgar savisaar elected the republics premier on 
tuesday said his government would focus on restoring independence 
economic reforms and attempts to avoid conflicts among estonias 
ethnic groups 
ethnic estonians make up only about 60 percent of the republics 
16 million people slavs and other nonestonian nationalities have 
voiced fears that the republics move toward independence would 
hurt their interests 
the area where this will be solved is economic savisaar 
said with politics we cant make them happy we cant improve 
it but the russians are also interested that the material side 
of life begins to grow better 
savisaar the chairman of the peoples front said following his 
election he would cooperate with all ethnic groups he said a list 
of cabinet members would be presented next week 
his statements today appeared to confirm reports from sources 
who said the new government was unlikely to include any of the 27 
legislators representing the interests of the nonestonian 
population in the 105member parliament 
in another development a bomb damaged a soviet t34 tank put up 
as a monument to soviet soldiers who died in world war ii near the 
estonian city of valga the soviet news agency tass reported 
hours after the bomb attack tuesday night about 20 youths armed 
with clubs pushed away a soldier guarding the damaged tank tore 
off a tarpaulin covering it and left police officers standing 
nearby did not intervene tass said

cambodian troops bombarded a 
strategic guerrillaheld town in the northwest wednesday after 
retaking another town the guerrillas and western sources said 
government forces took the district capital of thmar puok on 
tuesday with heavy rocket tank and infantry assaults said ok 
serei sopheak a spokesman for the khmer peoples national 
liberation front 
the front one of three guerrilla groups fighting the 
vietnamesebacked phnom penh government had held the town 
the government forces struck from positions to the south retaken 
in recent weeks another front official said 
other guerrillas said the town fell wednesday 
there was no way to explain the discrepancy or verify the 
reports 
guerrilla and western sources also said government forces on 
wednesday were shelling banteay chmar a district capital near 
thmar puok they said it was expected to fall soon 
if banteay chmar falls the government will have retaken every 
major position the guerrillas seized after vietnam announced last 
september it had pulled all its troops from cambodia 
both towns are in banteay meanchey province and close to the 
thai border 
guerrilla sources also reported a heavy government attack on the 
fronts military headquarters at boueng trakuan across the border 
from the thai town of ta phraya 
some of the rounds strayed into thailand western relief workers 
in ta phraya said the shelling on the other side of the border was 
so heavy that houses shook 
as many as 5000 refugees fleeing the fighting have gone to the 
giant site 2 refugee camp about 60 miles north of aranyaprathet 
western relief officials said 
western diplomats cited reports that thousands more civilians 
had fled thmar puok to remaining guerrillaheld areas inside 
cambodia which the guerrillas call liberated zones 
the noncommunist front is allied with two other guerrilla 
groups forces of former monarch prince norodom sihanouk and the 
communist khmer rouge the khmer rouge ruled cambodia by terror and 
famine until vietnams invasion ousted it from phnom penh more than 
a decade ago 
western relief workers said there were reports of heavy 
government attacks in the past few weeks on khmer rouge positions 
opposite the thai town of trat on the southern border with 
cambodia no details were immediately available 
the guerrillas have blamed the recent reversals on an 
interruption in arms shipments from china their main supplier and 
on what they claim is the reintroduction of thousands of vietnamese 
soldiers in cambodia

disease and also against ignorance and fear ryan has helped us 
understand the truth about aids and hes shown all of us the

there have been patients who have been this ill and have

the navy secretary and chief of the services 
operations on wednesday discounted a recent proposal by former navy 
secretary john lehman that called for greater reliance on reserve 
forces as a costsaving move 
i wont begin by saying nonsense but a lot of it is adm 
carlisle ah trost said of lehmans recommendation a member of 
the house armed services subcommittee on seapower and strategic and 
critical materials gave trost an account of lehmans testimony 
lehman who during his tenure in the reagan administration 
presided over one of the largest naval buildups told the armed 
services panel last week that the navy should use more reserves and 
reduce tours of duty for active forces 
the former navy secretary proposed manys ships and planes manned 
50 percent by active and 50 percent by weekend warriors 
but in the first public response by the navys top brass trost 
said the service has had difficulty attracting people of the 
necessary skills and the necessary numbers to the reserves 
the result has been that we man our naval reserve ships with a 
higher number of active duty personnel than we would like he 
said 
trost who serves as the chief of naval operations said that 
during the first nine months of his current assignment he did not 
recall lehman making those points offered in his recent testimony 
perhaps im missing something he said 
navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii who also disagreed with 
lehmans statements said that savings realized from relying on the 
reserves would be no greater than 10 perent or 15 percent 
expansion of naval reserve should be limited to areas where 
its cost effective mutual support can be provided to the active 
force because this navy needs to provide for this nations 
deterrence garrett said 
the navy secretary said in fiscal 1990 26 ships will be moved 
to the reserves the fiscal 1991 defense budget calls for putting 
40 ships in reserve he said 
questioned about the possibility of a 450ship navy garrett 
said he would fight any effort in the bush administration to reduce 
the force 
we will continue to argue our case with congress and the 
defense secretary he said there are no plans in the 
fiveyear plan to go to a 450ship navy

the state must give welfare recipients 
enough money to afford housing new yorks highest court ruled in a 
decision hailed as a victory for the homeless 
a schedule establishing assistance levels so low that it 
forces large numbers of families with dependent children into 
homelessness does not meet the statutory standard the court of 
appeals declared tuesday 
the court ordered a trial to determine whether new york states 
welfare shelter allowance is inadequate welfare advocates had 
argued the shelter allowance was set far below market rates for 
even the cheapest housing 
the case was brought by barbara jiggetts a new york city woman 
who complained her shelter allowance forced her to choose between 
housing and food for her children 
state social services commissioner cesar perales in a 
statement said the ruling established a requirement for a 
reasonable housing allowance but did not conclude the states 
welfare grants were inadequate 
the new york state department of social services is preparing 
for a trial on that issue perales said 
but lawyers for jiggetts said they believed the court of 
appeals strong language would make it hard for a lower court not 
to order increased welfare rates 
its a great decision and its very important for the welfare 
population of new york said allan gropper of the state bar 
associations project for the homeless of the city he said studies 
have shown as many as onethird of the homeless people in new york 
city had been evicted 
courts in massachusetts and other states have made similar 
rulings recently poverty law experts said 
jiggetts a single mother of three sued new york city social 
service officials in 1987 when she was being evicted from her 
apartment shes since found housing but other families joined the 
lawsuit and the state became the defendant said matthew diller a 
lawyer for the new york legal aid society 
new york state has more than 450000 welfare recipients 
twothirds in new york city 
christopher lamb another legal aid society lawyer said the 
shelter allowance for a family of four in new york city is 312 a 
month the department of housing and urban development reports the 
average market rate for a twobedroom apartment for poor people in 
new york city is 566 
people shouldnt be sent out into the new york city market and 
be told you have to find an apartment for a family of four at 312 
a month lamb said its like hitting your head against the 
wall 
welfare advocates supporting the lawsuit contended that in 
1987 more than 60 percent of aid to families with dependent 
children recipients living in private housing were forced to pay 
rents higher than their shelter allowances

after seven years of trying the government 
thinks it finally has an accurate count of how many secrets it 
creates 68 million a year 
thats a 35 percent decrease from the previous count but nearly 
all the drop came when the navy decided it really didnt originate 
more secrets than the rest of the government put together 
its still just an estimate but it appears that the top 
secret secret and confidential stamps were wielded 
6796501 times in the fiscal year which ended last sept 30 
it appears that this unprecedented drop is primarily the 
result of more accurate counting rather than an actual tremendous 
decrease in classification activity said steven garfinkel who 
has spent the past seven years trying to get the government to 
produce fewer secrets and count them more accurately 
garfinkel heads the information security oversight office 
created in 1982 when thenpresident reagan rewrote all the rules 
for classifying documents 
in his annual report to president bush released tuesday 
garfinkel praised the navy for finally figuring out what he has 
been trying to count each year 
the government doesnt actually count its secrecy decisions each 
year it samples the number of times some offices decide to 
classify information then it projects those numbers to reflect the 
number of decisions in all offices 
moreover there are two kinds of secrets original secrets of 
which 500000 were produced last year and derivative secrets of 
which 63 million were created for example an official creates an 
original secret by deciding that all photographs from a spy 
satellite will be kept secret another official creates a 
derivative secret each time he stamps one of the photos top 
secret 
a derivative secret also is created when one official copies 
another officials original secret into a new document the 
government equivalent of the friend who says dont tell 
soandso but i just learned that 
for 1987 and 1988 the navy reported creating far more original 
secrets than the rest of the government combined as garfinkel put 
it in his report to bush both the defense department and his 
office expressed skepticism about the accuracy of these data 
in 1989 the navy learned what went wrong some of its sample 
offices were reporting the number of all classified documents on 
hand not just classification decisions that they had originated 
garfinkel said 
fixing that error knocked about 35 million off the number of 
secrets created last year 
garfinkel said it didnt hurt that the navy sampled seven times 
more offices than before conducted its samples for almost half a 
year and provided all sample offices with extensive instructions 
and training 
of the four agencies the defense state and justice 
departments and the cia that create nearly 99 percent of the 
secrets only justice created more secrets in 1989 than 1988 not 
only that justice reported significant increases in the number of 
overclassified and mismarked documents 
but garfinkel said that was far from a failure at justice 
he said the number of secrets rose because more fbi agents are 
assigned to catch spies and fbi field offices are keeping better 
records the bureau creates more than 90 percent of justices 
secrets 
in addition garfinkel praised the fbi for starting to review 
actual documents as well as surveying agents which he said is how 
the bureau found the misclassified items thats a commendable 
effort to achieve better quality control he said 
overall in 1989 garfinkel said the strides were modest but 
whats most important is we finally have the defense department 
count in the ball park these numbers can provide a benchmark to 
look at future activity

nasa said wednesday testing of the 
15 billion hubble space telescope is taking longer than expected 
but that should not delay next weeks launch aboard space shuttle 
discovery 
the space agency had said testing of the telescope would have to 
be completed by midnight wednesday for discovery to lift off as 
planned tuesday that deadline was extended to thursday morning 
tests are going fine there are no problems but its going 
slower than we expected said george diller a spokesman for the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
a 52hour check of the telescopes scientific instruments was 
interrupted monday by a power outage that knocked out air 
conditioning and forced the shutdown of heatsensitive computers 
testing resumed tuesday evening after technicians switched over to 
a newer backup power system capable of withstanding an electric 
failure 
to accommodate the extra testing time nasa has rearranged 
launch preparations moving up certain things that normally would 
not have been done until later diller said 
charging of the telescopes nickelhydrogen batteries 
temporarily interrupted by the power outage also continued 
wednesday the batteries will be charged until two days before 
launch when the shuttles payload bay doors are closed 
technicians planned to close out the shuttles rear engine 
compartment this week that involves making final inspections 
removing protective covers for flight installing lastminute items 
and cleaning the area 
no extra time to solve problems is left and any further 
complications will delay the mission diller said nasa on saturday 
moved the launch from april 12 to april 10 because preparations 
were ahead of schedule 
discovery is scheduled to lift off at 847 am tuesday with 
five astronauts who will put the telescope into orbit on the second 
day of the fiveday mission 
once deployed the hubble will orbit 380 miles above earth for 
15 years free of atmospheric distortion it will be capable of 
detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater 
clarity than the best groundbased observatory 
astronomers will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant 
that their light has been traveling to earth for 14 billion years

el salvadors government and leftist rebels met 
for unmediated peace talks wednesday in a new effort to end 
their civil war but disagreement quickly surfaced on the issue of 
a ceasefire 
both sides and un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
agreed to seek a truce as an initial objective on the way to a 
negotiated settlement but shafik handal chief delegate of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front guerrillas made plain 
his group links acceptance of a ceasefire to progress on political 
reforms 
the rightist usbacked government of president alfredo 
cristiani says suspension of fighting must have priority 
the two sides signed a unsponsored declaration committing 
them to seek a ceasefire and a definitive end to the armed 
conflict through political means as speedily as possible 
the accord called for promoting moves toward democracy and 
respect for human rights in el salvador and reintegrating the fmln 
fighters into the nations shattered society 
the talks then recessed until may no date or location was 
announced for the next round 
el salvadors civil war has killed some 72000 people since it 
began in 1980 
the rebels have come under pressure since the defeat of the 
leftwing sandinista government in nicaraguas feb 25 election 
nicaragua helped the fmln for more than a decade us officials 
say nicaragua also was a transit point for cuban weapons shipments 
to the salvadoran guerrillas 
during a rebel offensive in november a soviet appeal for ending 
the bloodshed contrasted sharply with unflagging support for the 
guerrillas by cuban president fidel castro 
on wednesday fmln representatives and salvadoran government 
representatives led by justice minister oscar santamaria shook 
hands before signing the accord 
the sides held brief separate talks with perez de cuellar at the 
un building in geneva and met with alvaro de soto the un 
special envoy for central america to discuss procedure 
both sides agreed that future talks can either be facetoface 
or involve shuttle diplomacy by the united nations between the two 
delegations 
the simple fact of agreeing on the procedure for the 
realization of the negotiating process is a considerable advance 
de soto told reporters 
peace talks were last held in october they were suspended after 
a union headquarters was bombed in november and the rebels launched 
their offensive in san salvador more than 1000 people died in the 
fighting 
de soto has been working to resume a dialogue between the 
government and the rebels since cristiani met perez de cuellar in 
new york in february 
handal said the new talks must include issues such as 
restructuring of the army and police judicial reform and reform of 
el salvadors electoral system 
we are optimistic now because these negotiations are in the 
framework of the united nations the fmln official told a news 
conference this gives them a greater degree of seriousness and 
weight than in the past 
the salvadoran rebels in an open letter to this weeks summit 
of central american leaders in nicaragua proposed a plebiscite on 
constitutional reform to reduce the size of the countrys armed 
forces the proposed reform would also purge the military of 
rightwing elements and subject it to civilian authority 
the rebels urged that the plebiscite be held jointly with the 
1991 elections for a new national assembly in el salvador the 
letter said the rebels were willing to become peaceful political 
parties if an agreement were reached

actor burt reynolds testified in a lawsuit 
brought by the family of a veteran stuntman who was killed when his 
motorcycle plunged down a 40foot embankment while filming a movie 
in the arizona desert 
reynolds a former stuntman himself told a jury tuesday that 
remote filming locations should have helicopters or some other form 
of transportation available 
a film made by reynolds hooper included a character based 
on stuntman dar robinson who was 39 years old when he died of 
massive internal injuries in the 1986 accident 
his reputation was that he was the best in the business 
especially for high falls said reynolds 
robinson died while filming a highspeed motorcycle chase for 
million dollar mystery 
the multimillion dollar wrongful death lawsuit filed against 
dino de laurentiis entertainment group and productions ltd alleges 
that robinson died because an ambulance was not available it took 
two hours to get him to the nearest hospital 
defense attorneys maintain there was no ambulance on the set 
because robinson felt it was bad luck and felt it was an insult 
to his stunt abilities 
reynolds 54 testified in superior court that an ambulance was 
present on the set of stick a film in which robinson performed 
a fall from a 16story building without a protective airbag or net 
it is my understanding that if you are doing a major stunt 
there should be an ambulance present said reynolds who also 
directed the film

four years ago a new test that seemed to detect 
all forms of cancer from tiny blood samples appeared destined to 
revolutionize the way doctors screen people for the disease 
now many specialists doubt the method will ever live up to its 
promise for reasons they cannot explain the test seems to work 
only in the hands of the physician who invented it 
in 1986 dr eric t fossel of bostons beth israel hospital 
said he had found a way to tell whether a patient had cancer simply 
by examining a bit of his blood in a nuclear magnetic resonance 
scanner or nmr it would detect tumors too small to feel or spot 
on xrays 
fossel continued to work on the method and reported more 
encouraging results as he tested thousands of blood samples the 
discovery was so important that many other doctors hurried to try 
it out apparently without reported exception they failed 
two studies published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine the journal that first described fossels apparent 
breakthrough add to the mounting evidence against it 
we were unable to determine whether or not a person had cancer 
based on the blood test said dr paul okunieff of massachusetts 
general hospital 
carefully mirroring fossels methods okunieff tested blood from 
79 people with cancer or precancerous diseases and 66 people in 
the hospital for other reasons the test could not tell them apart 
terje engan directed a norwegian group from the university of 
trondheim that conducted a similar comparison of blood from 104 
cancer patients and 164 healthy people when the people studied 
were the same sex and age the test could not distinguish those 
with cancer from those without 
in his report okunieff reviewed 18 studies including his own 
that have used nmr to diagnose cancer only six all by fossel 
worked 
in one those studies published last year doctors from the west 
german cancer center in essen sent blood samples to fossel from 54 
men with testicular cancer 88 men who had been successfully 
treated for the disease and 57 healthy men the same age 
fossel who had no information about the patients status 
conducted the nmr tests and sent back the results the german 
doctors found that fossels findings were 90 percent accurate 
so the question remains how can a test work for one person but 
nobody else 
i honestly dont know what went wrong but there is this big 
difference between what hes getting and what other people 
reported commented dr robert shulman of yale university school 
of medicine 
fossel refused to discuss the latest reports but issued a 
statement implying that others have not duplicated his results 
because they failed to faithfully follow his methods 
clearly the nmr cancer blood test requires close adherence to 
the specified techniques he wrote but when carried out 
correctly this method is a candidate system for detection of 
cancer as well as for monitoring cancer therapy 
the controversy is reminiscent of the debate over cold fusion 
after a university of utah team announced the spectacular discovery 
of nuclear fusion in a lab jar a year ago other scientists have 
had trouble duplicating their findings the utah group responded by 
saying that the others had failed to precisely follow their 
techniques 
at the national cancer institute which has financed some of 
fossels research dr roger aamodt said he is reasonably sure 
that the test will not be suitable for general cancer screening 
however he said it might still be of some benefit in checking the 
progress of treatment or recurrence in some individual cancer 
patients 
aamodt said no one knows why the test seems to work only for 
fossel while its possible that the reasons have something to do 
with differences in techniques or the patient populations studied 
the explanations are essentially all supposition and 
speculation 
aamodt and okunieff said they thought fossel had honestly tried 
to obtain accurate results 
we are still in a position where it is up in the air said 
aamodt this has been a controversial area since the first 
finding a lot of people looked at this and said it didnt make 
sense all along there have been questions what you are seeing is 
science in action

when that first fuzzy satellite picture of the 
earth arrived just over 30 years ago weather experts were overjoyed 
now there was no way that any storm anywhere in the world 
would go undetected john w townsend jr director of nasas 
goddard space center recalled on wednesday 
and none has though people sometimes ignore the warnings that 
weather forecasters issue when storms are reported he noted at a 
news conference commemorating three decades of weather satellites 
the 90s is turning out to be the decade of the climate the 
point to be made today is that weve been around for 30 years 
measuring climate from space were not a johnnycomelately 
said russell koffler of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
satellites have revolutionized the science of weather 
prediction added j e keigler chief scientist for ge astro 
space which builds the tiros weather satellites 
he recalled meteorologists saying that the original machine 
would be worthwhile if it produced just one picture 
tiros 1 went on to produce 22000 pictures during its 
threemonth lifetime which began april 1 1960 
and since then theres always been a tiros in orbit he 
added referring to the series of lowlevel weather satellites that 
still circle the globe measuring the climate and weather every 
place on earth twice a day 
the lowlevel satellites marking their 30th anniversary are 
generically called tiros which is an abbreviation for television 
infrared observation satellite 
these days the public is more familiar with the goes satellites 
that hover in place over the equator looking down at the whole 
earth from 22300 miles in space 
but still a pair of tiros satellites zoom around the globe at a 
mere 700 or so miles getting a close look so far 32 of these 
satellites have been built and launched with an average lifepsan 
of 2 years 
and while the first satellites were limited to pictures of what 
is visible land water and clouds now they measure much more 
air and seasurface temperatures are taken snow and ice cover 
is tracked ozone is measured cloud cover measured water vapor in 
the air recorded and the radiation arriving from the sun and 
departing from the earth is tracked by these satellites explained 
koffler 
even the amount of vegetation on the land is measured from the 
satellites he added noting that this information is expected to 
be especially useful in assessing the response to any global 
changes in climate 
the satellites are operated by noaas national environmental 
satellite data and information service and are known by the 
designation noaa when in service a new noaa satellite is scheduled 
for launch in the fall

the sheriffs hall of fame

as sheriff and tax collector when he died in january 1933 
apparently had her picture removed soon after by a lawman who 
thought she didnt belong in the gallery 
but the current sheriff joe price brought her back to the 
gulfport courthouse tuesday after the huggins family offered him 
the portrait 
i feel she should be up there like anybody else who served the 
duties of sheriff price said 
mrs huggins ran against six opponents for the job of sheriff in 
march 1933 but lost by 500 votes to a former sheriff a man 
the truth is a lot of people hungered for the job of 
sheriff said her son cleveland huggins jr 73 it was a 
pretty good job then with the potential of making a lot of money 
price said she probably would have been elected if it had been 
a different era 1933 was a little early for a woman

a molten flow from the kilauea volcano 
surged beneath a house today destroyed it within an hour and 
threatened other residences in an 82home subdivision 
it was the first kalapana gardens home destroyed since lava 
enter the subdivision tuesday and the first destroyed by molten 
rock since a december 1986 flow wiped out dozens of homes in the 
subdivison 
tenants of the rented house moved out monday said ed torrison 
whose home was 50 feet away in the path of flow the lava passed 
within several feet of two homes tuesday and moved on to threaten 
two others besides the one engulfed at 6 am today 
like his neighbors torrison moved belongings out of his home 
that done he sat back to await the verdict of pele the hawaiian 
volcano goddess 
everybodys nervous but nobody wants to admit it said 
resident dennis gregory people dont freak out here this is 
hawaii everybody is taking it slow and easy 
residents cheered the thunderous explosions of methane from 
inside the flow and the flames that flashed through trees as the 
lava cut a swath through the dense foliage 
several people watched the approaching lava from the balcony of 
the closest home occasionally pitching beer bottles into the 
molten rock and laughing at repeated jokes about declining property 
values in the neighborhood 
its a party atmosphere said craig heiser a neighbor 
helping to evacuate residents you cant do anything about it so 
just enjoy it 
the authorities said residents of 57 homes had been evacuated 
and the entire community was on alert meaning an evacuation order 
could be issued within 72 hours in addition to the subdivision 
homes there are 43 other houses in the area 
whats happening now is the worstcase scenario said hawaii 
county civil defense administrator harry kim 
the lava late tuesday overran a rock wall into the backyard of a 
home and filled the sevenfoot gully in the yard its edge stopped 
just four feet from the home before it stopped moving sideways and 
moved down a gully 
the flow moved 100 yards down the gully overnight to threaten 
three more homes 
lava had come within 20 feet of one of those three homes by 
early today it surged forward burned a backyard tool shed then 
stopped as it built up a crust but it could liquefy and surge in 
another direction 
another flow to the east was about a halfmile above the 
subdivision kim said it appeared the flow would not threaten homes 
for at least another day 
civil defense and red cross officials opened a shelter at a 
community center 12 miles to the east 
other kalapana residents brought their families to view the 
destruction and creation 
people who live here are emotionally prepared for it but you 
still hope its not going to happen said donna olson whose home 
was destroyed in the 1986 flow she lives with her three children 
in a rented house threatened by the flow 
i feel very emotional about this but i also know theres a 
balance to pele i know everything here has been born from the 
lava its a circle

if dealmaking really is art then the bidding 
for bonwit teller that ended in a deal today was the aesthetic 
equivalent of finger painting 
a bankruptcy court hearing monday turned into a corporate casbah 
as attorneys frantically arranged offers for the failed department 
store chain not over the typical wall street power lunch but 
within earshot of a federal judge 
deals came together fell apart and came together again bidders 
changed sides an 11thhour proposal by a wouldbe savior failed a 
lawyer played auctioneer as two sides upped offers 1 million at a 
pop 
i need 250000 from each of you and i need it now donald n 
david a lawyer representing dealmaster donald trump implored 
members of a group bidding on five of the 16 bonwit department 
stores 
david got an icy stare from one participant who refused to 
raise his ante a representative of trump whose eponymous gold 
tower on fifth avenue houses bonwits flagship store and two 
other groups contributed the difference the deal lived 
the trump groups bid was accepted by the seller today and the 
bankruptcy court indicated it would approve the plan 
bankruptcy court is becoming a home away from home for american 
big business in the 1990s as companies stumble under the weight of 
junk bonds and other takeoverrelated and expansionrelated 
problems from the 1980s the decade of debt 
a new era of restructuring means more proceedings like the one 
monday in a steamy bankruptcy courtroom overlooking new york harbor 
amid shouting cajoling the toot of the staten island ferry and 
pounding of a jackhammer six floors below bonwits was carved up 
lawyers constantly pleaded for another minute as they huddled to 
cut a deal 
the nearly 10hour ordeal took place in open court where judges 
rarely tolerate more than one person speaking at a time let alone 
protests and open bidding 
ive never seen anything like it before david said tuesday 
i think if it werent for that informality they wouldnt have 
raised anywhere near the amount of money they did for the estate 
lj hooker corp bonwits atlantabased parent held the 
auction to raise the liquidation value of the upscale store chain 
it bought three years ago hooker had received just one bid for 
five stores before the auction 
the take for hooker creditors rose by millions 
a first round of bidding included offers from a french retailer 
a florida department store a buffalo chain a canadian investor 
and a group that included trump and the womens apparel store the 
limited 
as the second round began the trump group booted the limited 
and embraced pyramid cos a syracusebased shopping mall developer 
and owner that made the fivestore bid 
when it became apparent the group needed to raise its 2025 
million offer or lose out the haggling intensified david hustled 
about seeking more money he got it in 20 minutes the bid rose 
by 15 million collapsing once in the process 
the court looked like sothebys when two bidders battled for a 
bonwit store in exclusive palm beach fla lawyers for frances 
brewster inc a florida retailer and ralph hibbard a canadian 
investor called bids from opposite sides of the courtroom raising 
the price to 22 million from 16 million 
sounds like an auction bankruptcy judge tina brozman said 
to laughter 
after the hibbard group conceded hooker lawyer sheldon hirshon 
serving as impromptu auctioneer said going once going twice 
 
the final drama was provided by the days hopedfor white knight 
hooker lawyers had wanted to preserve the chain in the morning 
they had announced that a group led by bonwits former ceo william 
ruben was planning a bid for 13 stores in the midafternoon they 
said the deal was off 
around 630 pm lawyers told the judge it was on again ruben 
said his 36 million bid could make bonwit viable again all he 
needed was one day to arrange financing 
furious david said reopening the bidding would violate an 
agreement and make a fool out of everybody here hooker 
attorneys eventually acquiesced fearing they could lose all bids 
if the ruben group collapsed 
attorney alan hyman said hooker decided to resort to the heady 
and cerebral theory that a bird in the hand was worth two in the 
bush david an hour after pacing angrily and saying its 
off gave associates two thumbs up

recognizing it is in serious political trouble 
prime minister margaret thatchers government has moved to blunt 
the impact of its unpopular new local government tax 
but even though the socalled poll tax has provoked protest and 
a demonstration that turned into a riot saturday the government 
shows no sign of backing down 
instead mrs thatcher is taking a gamble that she can make the 
tax palatable by the mid1992 deadline for the next election and 
that even close aides acknowledge is an uncertain prospect 
thats the question and i dont know the answer said a 
thatcher aide speaking on condition of anonymity it is not easy 
to be popular when you are taxing 17 million more people 
on tuesday environment secretary chris patten ordered 20 
highspending local authorities to impose lower taxes and cut their 
budgets for the current fiscal year he said the move would reduce 
the bills of 4 million people by 50160 a year 
the tax that took effect april 1 averages 592 a person a year 
about onethird higher than the government target it must be paid 
by most of the 38 million adult britons previously only some 12 
million property owners paid local government taxes 
but the immediate effect of pattens capping of the 
highspenders was to exacerbate the controversy 
the opposition labor party was angered that no authorities ruled 
by mrs thatchers conservative party were on the list 
the targeted authorities claimed they would have to cut services 
and accused the government of being vindictive some threatened to 
fight the measure in court 
patten who is in charge of the tax is dropping hints of 
further finetuning but mrs thatcher says she will not abandon 
the community charge as the tax is officially called 
she introduced the reform believing a head tax was fairer than a 
property tax because it would net everybody not just homeowners 
she also believed that once the bills came in taxpayers would 
blame them on labor highspenders 
instead the blame is falling on her and the patten refinements 
appear to consist largely of spending more central government money 
to bring down the levels of the poll tax 
thats precisely what mrs thatcher did not want it smacks of a 
retreat and prevents her from cutting income tax and boosting 
oldage pensions health spending and other preelection favorites 
the furor over the tax is worsened by economic problems 
a year ago the tories were claiming to be whipping inflation and 
turning the economy around now interest rates have hit 15 percent 
inflation is heading above 8 percent and the tories have fallen 20 
points behind labor 
it is not possible to claim economic miracles one year and 
then be forced to put interest rates up to historically high levels 
the following year and retain a reputation for competence said 
john cole a political analyst for the british broadcasting corp 
but what has made this doubly difficult is the prime 
ministers own identification with the poll tax he wrote in the 
weekly listener 
saturdays riot appeared to be the work of groups of extreme 
leftists and anarchists it shocked britons and temporarily 
distracted from the tax itself 
but the issue shows no sign of dying and in the end it comes 
down to the personality of the 64yearold grocers daughter she 
wont be moved on an issue she believes is right and the poll tax 
is such an issue 
she has never been popular and her greatest strength is she 
has never actually aspired to be popular said the thatcher aide 
she has never wanted to be loved and that is the overriding 
quality of a successful statesman

compromises have allowed wyoming and idaho to join the movement 
toward national acceptance of a holiday honoring the rev martin 
luther king jr and by wednesday 22 years after his death only 
three states were holdouts 
i think it shows that we are making headway lloyd davis 
executive director of the king federal holiday commission said 
tuesday 
he expressed confidence that arizona new hampshire and montana 
would not hold out much longer amid what he sees as dramatic 
applications of kings nonviolent philosophy as far away as the 
philippines china poland and east germany 
whats happening around the world shows the universality of 
king davis said in a telephone interview from washington 
king was assassinated april 4 1968 at age 39 while leading a 
nonviolent movement for racial equality in 1983 after 
considerable debate congress created a holiday to honor king on 
the third monday in january around his jan 15 birthday 
martin luther king jr day first celebrated nationally in 1986 
is an official state holiday in some form in most states idaho is 
about to become the 47th 
wyoming which calls itself the equality state because it was 
the first to give women the vote had legislators who supported a 
holiday commemorating equal rights but didnt want it in kings 
name a compromise created martin luther king jr wyoming equality 
day 
idaho legislators gave final approval friday to an official 
state holiday honoring king but only after a compromise added 
idaho human rights day to the designation the bill has gone to 
gov cecil andrus who called for its passage in january 
new hampshire legislators have voted down holiday proposals 
first introduced in 1979 after losing in 1989 supporters said 
they would try again in 1991 the next time legislative rules allow 
it 
there are times when new hampshire can feel pride in its 
unique posture state rep deborah arnie arnesen said 
tuesday however i feel that our unique status visavis this 
holiday does not suggest a badge of courage but rather a badge of 
intolerance and prejudice 
edward dupont new hampshires senate republican leader says 
the proposal wont succeed if the holiday is meant to honor king 
alone he suggested a day to honor king as one of many civil 
rights contributors including presidents kennedy and johnson 
rather than going along with national practice 
we always have the distinction of being the last or the 
first he said montanas legislature in 1987 approved a bill 
making jan 15 a day of observance and creating heritage day a 
floating holiday to be designated by the governor this year gov 
stan stephens used it to create a long thanksgiving weekend 
causing no controversy in a state whose black population was 
counted at 1786 or a fifth of a percent in the 1980 census 
arizona is the most populous state without a king holiday but 
it hasnt attained that status without contortions 
former gov evan mecham a conservative who opposed his 
predecessors creation of a limited paid holiday in kings honor 
proclaimed a martin luther kingcivil rights day for the third 
sunday in january instead 
last year the legislature approved king day as a paid holiday 
for state employees and gov rose mofford signed the bill but 
opponents petitioned to prevent the law from taking effect unless 
its approved in a referendum in november 
some of the opponents were upset by revelations about womanizing 
by king or were persuaded by the ku klux klans repeated efforts to 
tar king as a communist others had nothing against honoring king 
but were upatarms that the legislature made room in the budget 
for king day by dropping columbus day as a paid holiday 
the legislature took that course because republican members 
didnt like two alternatives 1 combining the lincoln and 
washington birthdays into one presidents day as the federal 
government did or 2 springing for an additional holiday 
while a holiday costs overtime pay for indispensable workers 
mofford and other democrats and some moderate republicans argued 
that not having one could also be expensive the state has faced a 
sporadic boycott especially as a convention and meeting site 
when the national football leagues owners awarded the 1993 
super bowl to the phoenix area march 13 norman braman head of the 
site selection committee said if there is a smear on the martin 
luther king holiday of any kind i will personally lead the effort 
to rescind the super bowl we wouldnt want to go there 
phoenix and suburban tempe where the game would be played have 
their own king holiday

president bush on wednesday called the 
emigration of soviet jews a modern exodus and some he met at a 
white house passover ceremony said antisemitism was increasing in 
the soviet union 
natasha stonov a physician whose husband is still in the soviet 
union said that the jewish people in the soviet union are in 
panic and its massive panic 
during my life a long life i feel there is the highest level 
of antisemitism i may compare it with the germany in 1938 i 
think the situation for the soviet jew is even worse she said 
speaking in english with reporters on the white house driveway 
asked whether soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev was making 
matters worse by encouraging a sense of soviet nationalism she 
said i think so i think in the soviet union nothing is 
spontaneous everything is organized 
bush invited a group of soviet jews many of whom will resettle 
in israel to a white house ceremony honoring passover the 
eightday celebration beginning monday night that commemorates the 
exodus of jews from egypt 
bush called passover a poignant occasion in the year that has 
seen freedoms lights begin to glow all over the world in eastern 
europe in central and south america in africa and even in the 
soviet union 
this is a special time of rejoicing for the more than 15000 
soviet jews who have made their way to israel this year bush 
said 
the modern exodus is a great event for all those who delight 
in human freedom he said 
joining him at the ceremony was vladimir raiz and his wife 
karmella raiz permitted to leave the soviet union late last month 
after 18 years of trying was praised by bush as a brave symbol 
for all refuseniks 
he wished the dissident and his wife and your children many 
years of happines in your new home in israel 
karmella raiz told reporters afterwards that the ability of her 
husband to finally leave the soviet union was a big victory of 
the united states government 
but she noted so many people are still waiting in russia to 
be free 
she said that as a lithuanian she was particularly sensitive 
to the struggles of that baltic state to win independence from 
moscow i feel pity for the people their country cannot be 
free she said 
bush in his white house remarks said the united states would 
continue to apply pressure on the soviet union to allow more soviet 
jews to emigrate including pressing for direct and indirect 
flights to israel 
the soviet jews remaining in the soviet union against their 
wills are not forgotten bush said

the 24 black members of the house introduced 
their proposed fiscal 1991 budget on wednesday a plan that would 
dramatically alter president bushs priorities for defense and 
domestic spending 
the congressional black caucus proposal offered on the 22nd 
anniversary of the assassination of the rev martin luther king 
jr would slash bushs request for pentagon spending and shift 
money into social programs 
the caucus has been offering such budgets for a decade congress 
has never adopted the proposals but they are generally seen as the 
liberal expression of how federal resources should be divided up 
we can provide for a proper national security defense posture 
and increase spending for vitally needed social programs said 
the caucus chairman rep ronald v dellums dcalif 
the black caucus would slash military spending to 280 billion 
24 billion below the level bush wants 
it rejects the 55 billion in cuts bush has requested in 
medicare aid to the elderly and handicapped it boosts federal 
welfare programs by 53 billion and adds 4 billion to the 45 
billion bush is seeking for education and job training programs 
the plan would raise 198 billion in new tax revenues 59 
billion more than bush by placing a 10 percent surcharge on the 
countrys topearning corporations and by raising the tax rate on 
the nations wealthiest individuals 
the house and senate budget committees hope to finish work on 
the 1991 budget later this month

sen alfonse damato rny said wednesday 
he will try to enter lithuania without a soviet visa to show the 
soviet union that the united states opposes the use of force in the 
baltics 
i think its incumbent upon the united states our congress 
our people and those people who cherish freedom throughout the 
world to stand and to say if you want trade concessions mr 
gorbachev if you want access to our technological achievements if 
you want to have the normalization of relationshps then you make 
sure you dont suppress the rights of lithuanians and others 
damato said at a news conference 
damato planned to leave wednesday night on a commercial flight 
to warsaw poland he was traveling with several senate staffers 
at least one translator and several reporters 
in poland the group was to be met by the lithuanian foreign 
minister and other lithuanian government officials who planned to 
accompany them on the attempted border crossing probably friday 
damato who holds a lithuanian visa had been invited into the 
country by lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis 
the senator admitted it was not very likely hed succeed in 
crossing the border which the soviets closed tuesday but he said 
the trip would be a success anyway because his message would get 
to the lithuanian people 
neither the white house nor the state department tried to 
discourage him from making the trip damato saidnesday 
therefore he suggested he had the administrations unspoken 
permission to play the heavy on lithuania while president bush 
continued a moderate stand 
if you want to say bad cop good cop then we should be the 
bad cop he said

south korea has formally agreed to a 
us plan to cut 7000 of the 43000 american troops stationed in 
the country by 1993 the defense ministry announced wednesday 
the ministry said the two countries also agreed to change their 
joint command system to give south korea more control over its 
military 
we have reached full agreement on a gradual us troop 
withdrawal which will initially affect 7000 noncombatants a 
ministry statement said 
the announcement had been expected since february when defense 
secretary dick cheney disclosed plans to close three of the five 
us air bases in south korea to save money 
in talks with seoul officials us officials indicated they 
would pull out 5000 ground troops all noncombatants and 2000 
air support personnel in several years 
the ministry said american troop withdrawal from south korea 
would be made in three stages with the first stage affecting 7000 
soldiers in the 199093 period 
after the first stage officials of the two countries will 
review the situation on the korean peninsula including north 
koreas war capability to decide whether to push further cuts in 
the 199495 period it said 
thirdstage cuts if needed would take place after 1996 it 
said 
the ministry said the two countries also have agreed to alter 
their joint command system to give south korea more control over 
its armed forces the ministry said 
currently most of south koreas 650000member armed forces 
remain under the operation control of a fourstar us general in a 
combined command system officials say is aimed at maximizing combat 
efficiency 
the system has been criticized by radical korean students and 
dissidents as an example of american infringement upon south korean 
sovereignty 
the ministry said the system would be changed in the 199495 
period allowing south korean generals to command their units in 
peacetime in wartime the joint command system would be restored 
it said 
details of the change would be discussed at annual security 
consultative talks to be held in washington in november ministry 
officials said 
other issues under discussion between the two countries include 
appointment of a south korean general to head the united nations 
command in armistice talks with north korea replacing a us navy 
admiral they said 
the command consists of the united states and 15 other free 
world countries that fought on south koreas side during the 
195053 korean war 
also under discussion is the replacement of us troops guarding 
the border village of panmunjom and its vicinity with south korean 
soldiers the officials said 
nearly all of the 155mile border with north korea is guarded by 
south korean troops the 2nd us infantry division the only 
american combat division in south korea is based away from the 
border

three powerful house democrats said thursday 
aid to zaire should be eliminated because president sese seko 
mobutu is corrupt and abuses human rights 
no bill that bears my name will have any money for that 
turkey said rep david obey dwis referring to mobutu 
obey chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee on 
foreign operations was joined by reps howard wolpe dmich 
chairman of the house africa subcommittee and stephen solarz head 
of the house asia subcommittee in seeking to slash all but 
development aid to zaire 
the time has come to cut this character off said solarz 
who compared mobutu to ousted dictators like ferninand marcos in 
the phillippines and nicolai ceausescu in romania 
solarz said conservative estimates put mobutus personal fortune 
at 25 billion some of it siphoned off from the state for 
instance some 400 million in mineral revenues is missing from the 
zaire budget according to the world bank 
mobutu reportedly has a 16th century castle in spain a 32room 
palace in lausanne switzerland a 750000 apartment in paris and 
luxurious estates in portugal italy and several african countries 
solarz said 
wolpe said he backed eliminating all military aid to zaire and 
requiring that aid for food development and health programs be 
given to private nongovernmental groups instead of to the 
government congress required that provision last year 
he said he wanted to end the assistance because most 
governmenttogovernment economic aid as well as military aid such 
assistance condones government corruption 
human rights violations are commonplace in zaire wolpe said 
the state department said in its annual human rights report that 
security organizations harass detain and physically mistreat the 
governments political opponents 
secretary of state james baker iii visited zaire last month and 
reportedly brought up the case of two american human rights lawyers 
who were attacked and robbed in kinshasa wolpe said 
the united states has long view zaire as an ally and uses the 
mineralrich former french colony as a transit point through which 
to ship weapons to anticommunist rebels in angola wolpe has 
called for an end to the covert program in angola 
the bush administration is seeking a total of 53 million in aid 
to zaire including 4 million for the military 33 million for 
development and 16 million for food

<TEXT>
the united states called wednesday for a 
roundup of firearms passed out to civilians by nicaraguas 
sandinista government after its election defeat in february

civilians in recent weeks would help create conditions of 
confidence that would further the demobilization process state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler told reporters 
she said that for demobilization of military forces to proceed 
in nicaraguait is essential that an expanded united nations 
observer force be deployed at once to verify a mutual ceasefire 
between sandinista forces and the antisandinista contra rebels

it must be solved on the ground with adequate security 
guarantees and verification mechanisms

presidentelect violeta chamorro and the sandinista government 
states that all weapons should be in the hands of the armed forces

labor party leader shimon peres said wednesday 
he had enough support in parliament to form a ruling coalition and 
requested a special session to approve the new government 
peres refused to name the members of the proposed government he 
said secrecy was necessary as he tried to recruit more lawmakers 
into a broader government but radio reports questioned whether the 
labor leader actually had the needed votes 
i said we have a majority more than that i wont say peres 
said on israel radio 
if peres succeeds the new government may move toward accepting 
us proposals for starting middle east peace talks yizhak 
shamirs refusal to accept the proposals led to the fall of his 
government march 15 
peres labor party had accepted compromise proposals by 
secretary of state james a baker iii for opening a dialogue with 
palestinians as a step toward israeliproposed elections in the 
occupied territories 
conservatives in the coalition government that was headed by 
shamir refused to go along creating an impasse that led to a vote 
of noconfidence against shamirs government 
peres notified president chaim herzog that he had succeeded in 
getting majority backing in the 120member parliament or knesset 
to replace the coalition 
he said he had appealed to the speaker of parliament to convene 
the legislature as soon as possible preferably by sunday to 
approve the new government 
peres and other labor leaders refused to provide details on the 
composition of the new government 
i have time until the knesset convenes to make the list and 
divide portfolios there is still work before us peres said 
until earlier wednesday peres had only 60 assured votes he 
needed at least one more legislator to vote with him or abstain 
staterun israel and army radio stations quoted sources from the 
rival likud bloc as saying they doubted peres had the needed votes 
they speculated he was simply trying to lure more supporters 
other reports said peres succeeded in enticing a defector from 
the rightwing likud led by shamir 
yossi sarid of the leftwing citizens rights movement identified 
the legislator as avraham sharir a former tourism minister sharir 
could not be reached for comment 
sarid and leaders of two other leftwing parties mapam and 
shinui questioned the wisdom of bringing a defector into the 
government they said it was not certain whether they would join 
such a cabinet 
we see this as a problem that goes to the very core of israeli 
democracy said amnon rubinstein of shinui i resigned from the 
government over peace but democracy is also important to me 
however the leaders of the three parties said they might vote 
in support of such a coalition during the special knesset session 
their 10 votes would still allow peres to form the government 
labor legislators chaim ramon and moshe shahal said the party 
had decided on secrecy concerning the composition of the government 
because it did not want to expose defectors or parties willing to 
join a labor government to pressure from likud 
the political system is full of pressure on all those who want 
to support this government ramon said on army radio 
with the parliament vote not likely until sunday likud has time 
to try to lure potential labor coalition partners back into its 
fold 
if peres wins the vote of confidence in parliament it could be 
the first time since 1977 that labor rules without likud the two 
parties have shared power in coalition governments since 1984 
following inconclusive elections 
peres was prime minister from september 1984 until october of 
1986 
peres said he and his labor colleagues had worked with a 
candle at our feet in order to form the new government before 
the beginning of passover on april 9 
if we didnt succeed in putting together the government before 
passover we would have stood for long weeks without a functioning 
government without the defense ministry manned with waves of 
immigrants to be absorbed and with serious economic problems 
peres said 
shamirs coaltion formed in december 1988 fell at a crucial 
time as israel faced key questions on the peace process and on how 
to handle a wave of soviet jewish immigrants 
the baker compromises that split labor and likud called for 
israel to accept palestinian negotiators in preliminary talks who 
were deported from the occupied territories or who have ties to 
arab east jerusalem 
hardliners in the rightwing party argued the two steps could 
bring the palestine liberation organization into the peace process 
they also said the moves might raise questions about israels hold 
over the eastern half of jerusalem which it captured in the 1967 
middle east war 
israel considers the plo a terrorist organization and refuses to 
deal with it

hungary on wednesday dropped the last 
of its holidays celebrating communist rule ceasing to mark april 4 
as the day the red army freed hungary from nazi germany at the 
conclusion of world war ii 
although hungarians did not perceive their liberation as 
solving their problems april 4 was officially marked the past four 
decades as the greatest hungarian national holiday accompanied 
by much pomp and ceremony 
but wednesdays issue of the trade union daily nepszava said the 
liberation of hungary by the soviet army at the end of the war 
failed to stop the suffering in the country 
out of the blood and filth the suffering and tragedy not 
freedom not independence not democracy were born but the 
occupation and oppression of the nation by soviet troops the 
paper said 
let us bid goodbye to a holiday and to an empire celebrated 
under duress it added 
soviet troops have been in hungary since the end of world war 
ii associated mostly with the bloody crushing of the 1956 
anticommunist uprising for more democracy and a multiparty system 
moscow agreed to withdraw its troops in the initial days of the 
revolt but instead of departing the red army poured in 
reinforcements to quash the uprising 
under a historic bilateral agreement last month to remove all 
soviet soldiers from the country by mid1991 the first red army 
troops began to leave hungary on march 12 moscow has about 49000 
troops stationed in hungary 
on march 25 hungarians went to the polls for the first free 
multiparty elections in more than 40 years and voted the communists 
and their successors the socialists out of power 
last year parliament abolished nov 7 the day of the 
bolshevik revolution in russia as a national holiday 
it was replaced by march 15 the anniversary of the abortive 
1848 revolution for independence from austrian habsburg rule

logging must stop across a large section of 
national forests in the pacific northwest to keep the northern 
spotted owl from becoming extinct a government panel of scientists 
said wednesday 
environmentalists hailed the recommendations as an important 
step toward listing the owl as a threatened or endangered species 
but industry leaders said the panels proposals could devastate the 
regions timberbased economy 
the interagency committee led by us forest service biologist 
jack ward thomas recommended in a report a reduction of about 25 
percent in the allowable cut in national forests and a 30 percent 
to 40 percent reduction on bureau of land management areas 
we have concluded that the owl is imperiled over significant 
portions of its range because of continuing losses of habitat from 
logging and natural disturbances the report said current 
management strategies are inadequate to ensure its viability 
the panels recommendation is expected to weigh heavily in the 
us fish and wildlife services decision on whether to list the 
owl as a threatened or endangered species the service which must 
make a decision by june 23 extended its public comment period 
until april 11 to receive the panels recommendation 
make no mistake about it this is a very influential 
document said rep les aucoin dore heres the bluest of 
blueribbon committees yet put together and it has recommended a 
logging reduction they say thats the minimum necessary to 
sustain a population of owls 
the owl lives primarily in the neverlogged oldgrowth of 
western washington and oregon its population has been reduced by 
about 60 percent since 1800 the report said 
thomas said during a congressional hearing wednesday that if 
future federal harvests continued at current levels there would be 
a dramatic reduction in the owls population especially on 
washingtons olympic peninsula 
certainly we would see local extinction ultimately i think 
we would see overall extinction i dont know how long it would 
take he said 
thomas said there currently are about 1700 breeding pairs of 
owls in the northwest he said if the panels proposals are 
implemented the number could grow to 2200 pairs within 100 years 
if everything went right 
the study recommends current timber sales on federal lands 
continue as scheduled through the end of september the end of the 
fiscal year 
the report was delivered wednesday to a joint meeting of the 
agriculture subcommittee on forests family farms and energy the 
interior subcommittee on national parks and public lands and the 
merchant marine and fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and 
wildlife conservation 
f dale robertson chief of the forest service said his 
calculations indicated the recommendations would reduce timbersale 
programs on national forests with owls by 1 billion to 13 billion 
board feet that would be 30 percent to 40 percent below an 
alreadyreduced harvest level that resulted from a compromise 
worked out last year to ease the immediate threat to the spotted 
owl 
national forests gross revenues will decline resulting in a 
loss of payments to counties although these reductions may be 
offset with a rise in prices because of log shortages he said 
robertson said the recommendations would affect 27 million 
acres of the forest services commercial timber base including 
about 19 million acres in oregon and washington and about 800000 
acres in northern california 
robertson said thomas predicted more than 6 million acres would 
be affected overall but that many of those acres already are being 
protected 
cy jamison director of the bureau of land management said the 
total cut on blm lands in western oregon would drop about 335 
million board feet or between 30 percent and 40 percent if the 
proposals were adopted

twentyfive inmates surrendered at 
devastated strangeways prison on wednesday and authorities 
negotiated individually with others in an attempt to end a 
4dayold uprising 
our tactic is to persist in patient negotiations to bring this 
dreadful event to a successful conclusion said terry bone 
deputy director of the north region of the prison service 
solicitor barry cuttle a member of the negotiating team said 
20 to 25 prisoners remained inside the victorian prison which was 
severely overcrowded when the rioting began sunday 
a lot of them are very keen to come out and never wanted to 
have anything to do with this he said i cant say whether 
they were stopped from coming out or remained from some misguided 
sense of loyalty 
one prisoner derek white died tuesday of injuries suffered in 
the first day of the disturbance white was awaiting trial on 
charges of assaulting three children 
british media have speculated that up to 30 prisoners died in 
the rioting mainly sex offenders who are despised by other 
inmates cuttle said he had seen no bodies dozens of prisoners and 
guards were injured in the chaos 
bone said the authorities were trying to make sure facilities 
for the remaining inmates were reduced to an absolute minimum 
though water was available from prison tanks 
it is still a very confused situation and it is possible that 
some food has been taken out of the kitchen and other areas of the 
prison bone said 
prison governor brendan ofriel who characterized the uprising 
as an explosion of evil told reporters more than 1500 inmates 
had been caught up in the violence and vandalism 
cuttle characterized the attitude of the remaining inmates as 
calm more reasonable listening to the prison officers side 
theyre seeing sense 
he said negotiators were moving through various parts of the 
prison to speak with individual prisoners who asked to negotiate 
asked why the prisoners had rioted cuttle said theyve all 
got their own personal reasons 
prison authorities apparently hoped snowy weather would drive 
the inmates out of their unheated and unlighted quarters but 
bright sunshine lured many inmates to the roof from where they 
could see as many as 300 supporters standing outside by late 
afternoon most had gone inside 
the editor of the manchester evening news who spent 10 hours 
inside the prison tuesday as a neutral observer requested by the 
prisoners said inmates complained of mental and physical 
brutality misuse of drugs in controlling prisoners poor food and 
cramped conditions 
strangeways was built in 1868 to hold 970 men but held 1648 
prisoners when the riot broke out it contains inmates of all 
categories from extremely dangerous to low risk 
in a story in wednesdays edition of the news editor michael 
unger said the areas he saw were devastated 
strewn around the stenchfilled wings were smashed toilets 
wrecked television sets rippedout telephones and huge steel 
doors ripped off their hinges water was pouring down and the 
stink of burning was almost too much to bear unger wrote 
ofriel told reporters wednesday morning that the standoff was 
a delicate and difficult situation 
my hope is that these negotiations will result in a peaceful 
end to this incident he said 
following the death of her husband whites pregnant 
24yearold wife jean called for the inmates to end the siege 
i want them to know that my child will grow up without knowing 
its daddy mrs white said now they have nothing to gain and 
should give themselves up 
whites attorney basil herwald said his client had been 
refused bail even though prosecutors indicated he would face trial 
on only one of eight charges herwald said whites death was an 
example of how the system fails the innocent 
strangeways was a filthy inhumane system for the innocent and 
the guilty herwald said

reducing production of the b2 bomber will 
raise the cost of a single plane to more than 1 billion says a 
congressional study that several lawmakers on wednesday called 
grounds for canceling the flying fort knox 
it confirms my very worst fears that if you stretch out the 
b2 program it simply adds billions of dollars to its costs said 
sen patrick leahy dvt as he joined with a bipartisan group of 
b2 opponents in releasing the congressional budget office report 
leahy and sen alan cranston dcalif introduced legislation 
to stop procurement of the stealth aircraft at the 15 planes now in 
production 
the bush administrations plans call for building 132 of the 
radarevading aircraft by 1996 at a cost of more than 70 billion 
air force secretary donald rice told a congressional panel tuesday 
that the bush administration is weighing alternatives to that 
proposal 
according to the cbo study canceling the program would save 
415 billion 
what we ought to do is have the guts now to say enough is 
enough and stop at the 15 that are in production leahy told a 
capitol hill news conference 
legislation to kill the b2 garnered just over 30 votes in the 
senate last year leahy and cranston said they have picked up 
strength but declined to provide numbers on the opponents 
however rep jim slattery dkan said wednesday that a head 
count in the house indicates that 195 members oppose the bomber 
the cbo report concluded that if the air force reduces its 
planned buy of 132 to 66 the total cost of the program which the 
agency estimates is about 75 billion will be reduced by 186 
billion 
however the cost of a single plane now estimated at 530 
million will rise to 860 million 
if the administration decides to buy 33 planes at a rate of 
three per year the bomber would cost 17 billion a copy 
the stealth is a budgetary black hole it attracts and 
devours public funds like a condensed star attracts and devours 
light said sen joseph lieberman dconn who joined leahy 
cranston and sen mark hatfield rore at the news conference 
further complicating the b2 issue is the annual cost of the 
program in the mid1990s the pentagon plans to buy 10 planes in a 
single year and 24 the next year budget requests would then total 
nearly 10 billion a year 
leahy pointed out that last year defense secretary dick cheney 
urged congress not to nickel and dime to death the program 
because stretching out the program would drastically increase the 
cost 
hes right the cbo report shows hes absolutely right 
leahy said of cheney 
the vermont senator added that if we stretch it out as some 
who are trying desperately to save this flying fort knox that 
assumes two or three years from now that well find 8 billion or 
9 billion in the budget for that years procurement alone 
nobody in their right mind thinks that were going to find 
that much money in any one year 
cranston said the pentagon is on notice the b2 wont fly in 
congress not 132 not 66 not even 33

the governor said wednesday that being 
stripped of a veto power that enabled him to strip letters from 
words of bills would not stop him from altering the meaning of 
unacceptable legislation 
absolutely not gov tommy g thompson said a day after 
voters approved by 62 percent a constitutional amendment curtailing 
that power named after wheel of fortune letterturner vanna 
white 
im not going to hold back on vetoes at all 
elsewhere voters in kansas city mo rejected a curbside 
recycling program that would have cost households 189 a month 
st louis voters approved a 35 percent hotelmotel tax increase to 
help build a 70000seat domed stadium 
thompson once used his veto to change the amount of time a 
juvenile could be held in detention crossing out 48 hours 
along with selective letters to make the time read ten days 
the veto was criticized by opponents who said it gave the 
governor unconstitutional power to change the meaning of 
legislation 
im not overly excited about it but the people had a choice 
and i will live by it thompson said adding he would not use the 
vanna veto on the 221 bills pending on his desk 
the amendment still allows the governor to delete numbers words 
or sentences with a veto a lawsuit is pending in federal court 
that challenges his right to strike numbers and decimals from 
legislation 
state rep david travis a democrat who backed the amendment 
vowed to seek further limits on the veto power 
we wanted it to be power to turn something down not create 
it travis said 
wisconsin voters also reelected supreme court justice donald 
steinmetz to a second 10year term despite claims by steinmetzs 
opponent a deaf appeals judge that the high court was not working 
hard enough 
steinmetz received 52 percent of votes to challenger richard s 
browns 48 percent according to unofficial returns steinmetz 
acknowledged that brown may have raised valid concerns about the 
court 
chief justice nathan s heffernan declined wednesday to say how 
the election campaign might affect the court 
im not about to say that the reputation of the supreme court 
was enhanced or hurt by the election heffernan said it might 
have helped criticism is always good for people as well as 
institutions 
in northern wisconsin state rep jim holperin defeated 
challenger brian sherren in the states first legislative recall 
election in 58 years holperin was targeted by those opposed to 
allowing chippewa indians to exercise treaty rights to go

janis t gabay of san diego teacher of the 
year with a crystal apple and a presidential salute to show for it 
says she once thought of quitting because she saw such lack of 
respect for her profession 
but ms gabay declared herself optimistic about us education 
wednesday as president bush and his wife barbara honored her at 
the white house 
the kind of people jan represents are ambassadors to the most 
powerful province mankind might command that great undiscovered 
realm right under your hat bush told a crowd that included 11 
members of ms gabays family 
for almost 40 years the teacher of the year program has 
singled out the few really because they represent the many he 
said the programs goal is really not to identify the best 
teacher but the best in all teachers 
fighting back tears the petite high school english teacher 
accepted the award from bush and a kiss from the first lady 
thanking officials for giving a credible and assertive voice to 
this nations concerns about education 
earlier in an interview she said it is very easy to become 
disillusioned from all that we hear outside of education itself it 
feels like oftentimes we are not supported were not acknowledged 
were seen as those people who do those tasks rather than as 
professionals 
that disappoints me and personally even affected me at one 
point where i really stopped to reconsider whether i was in the 
right profession said the high school english teacher 
ms gabay said she is happy she was able to shake the doubts 
im very optimistic about education she said i cannot be 
a teacher without being an optimist i have great faith in the 
abilities of our students thats my job to tap that to elicit 
that to bring out that performance every student is full of 
marvelous potential 
she said teachers must be seen as professionals who if given 
the support and resources can push students to become top 
achievers 
gaining respect is no problem for her personally according to 
one student at san diegos junipero serra high school where she has 
taught 10th and 12th grade english the past 10 years 
steve nguyen 17 said wednesday i am vietnamese and in my 
culture the teacher has absolute power and respect here teachers 
dont get much respect but ms gabay gets it from her students no 
one ditches this class 
to ms gabay there is no wrong answer thats why she really 
can bring out the critical thinking in all of us the student 
said 
ms gabay 39 was born in hawaii and came to san diego as a 
child a graduate of san diego state university she has been a 
teacher for 17 years in all 
as 1990 national teacher of the year she said i stand for 
the superior teaching that does in fact occur in hundreds of 
classrooms across the country 
an innovative teacher ms gabay in 1983 helped organize a 
program with the san diego union in which students review for 
pay childrens and young adult books for the newspaper 
in passing on her love of writing and literature to her students 
and colleagues she said her focus is on the entire range of 
human experience 
i offer my students as many ideas as i can by showing them 
through literature that there is nothing that has not already been 
felt experienced or thought but much to be discovered in a new 
way 
she was chosen from among the nations more than 25 million 
elementary and secondary public school teachers by a special panel 
formed by the council of chief state school officers 
as teacher of the year ms gabay said she will encourage 
various groups during her yearlong ambassadorship to work 
together to bring about quality education 
gordon ambach executive director of the school officers group 
which sponsors the program in partnership with encyclopaedia 
britannica inc said the program has taken on an international 
focus as last years winner mary v bicouvaris of hampton va 
recently visited the soviet union and both the 1988 and 1989 
winners visited japan 
the other finalists this year were rachel s moreno a spanish 
teacher at flowing wells high school in tucson ariz billy dean

settlement proposal which includes 18 million to buy about 400 
homes nearest the refinery and 5 million for the establishment of 
a settlement fund 
the company proposed the settlement without admitting fault or 
liability 
while the settlement must be approved by a federal judge 
scheduled to hear the case june 5 attorneys for the refinery said 
the proposal is one of the largest corporate settlements ever 
recorded in an environmental contamination lawsuit 
similar cases involved government money the evacuation of homes 
built atop tons of chemical waste at love canal in niagara falls 
ny and the virtual abandonment in 1982 of times beach mo 
which was tainted by dioxin 
although residents had fought for years for a solution to the 
problems brought by the orangetinted water many are sad about the 
thought of leaving homes that have built up a lot of memories over 
the past quarter of a century and they worry about finding places 
to live that they can afford after selling their old homes 
weve been in the same house for 36 years said cecil 
landis 62 from his service station my yards been sinking 
we have a cellar we cant go into because of the fumes and i 
bought the house on account of the cellar 
my grandson says lets not move granny mrs barnett 
said i lost my only son and my husband 16 months apart a while 
back so its got a lot of memories 
veda lamb who is bedridden said she and her husband roy will 
have a hard time finding a home within their reach 
we cant go too high because were not rich she said 
there aint no rich people that live around here 
most of the people who live in the area tend to be of retirement 
age and low to moderateincome said chamber of commerce 
information secretary cheryl flink 
much of the area which one resident called the low rent 
rendezvous of ponca city is lowlying and susceptible to 
standing water during heavy rain ms flink said 
residents are not the only ones affected by the proposed 
settlement 
family discount pharmacy no 2 owner ron terry said his business 
will be affected 
a lot of business comes from that area terry said if 
those 400 homes are moved out that will be approximately 1600 
people 
theyll have to go to the east or west side of town he 
said it will definitely change the way were doing business down 
there 
but terry who has owned the drugstore since 1981 said hes 
glad for the residents 
ben delaney a former conoco employee whose house faces the 
refinery said he doesnt blame his former employer 
you cant just point the finger at one and say its their 
fault said the 64yearold retiree i made a living with them 
for better than 30 years 
still delaney said hes not looking forward to leaving the 
neighborhood hes lived in for so long 
ive known these people my kids grew up with them some have 
passed away he said itll be difficult but i think i can 
live through it

a private group said in a lawsuit filed 
wednesday that the pentagons biological warfare research program 
should be halted because potential environmental dangers havent 
been adequately examined 
the foundation on economic trends is seeking preliminary and 
permanent injunctions in us district court to terminate the 
program until the pentagon assesses possible harm from the research 
in greater depth 
an army analysis completed last year fails to analyze safety and 
security measures and emergency medical procedures at research 
sites around the country the lawsuit alleges 
the army study is grossly inadequate in assessing the 
nature of the severity of the impacts the research may have on 
human health and the environment said the lawsuit by the 
nonprofit group and its president jeremy rifkin 
laboratory research with biological materials is potentially 
hazardous concluded last years study but over the years 
elaborate controls have been developed to assure adequate 
protection for the environment 
the army said last year that the process of working with deadly 
toxins has actually become safer over the years 
better containment equipment and facilities became available 
and more effective biosafety protocols were developed 
the pentagons biological defense research program is conducted 
at more than 100 military university and private laboratories in 
27 states and eight foreign countries 
some 90 million was spent on the program in 1989 the lawsuit 
said last year the pentagon estimated the figure at 60 million 
annually 
chuck dasey public affairs officer for the us army medical 
research and development command at fort detrick md declined to 
comment saying he had not seen the lawsuit 
fort detrick is one of the biological research facilities

rightwing christian militia gunners 
knocked rebel gen michel aouns television station off the air 
wednesday night in renewed fighting and clergymen appealed for a 
ceasefire in the 2monthold power struggle 
twenty maronite catholic bishops met for three hours then 
issued a statement after meeting with patriarch nasrallah sfeir at 
his mountain seat in the bkirki monastery north of beirut 
samir geagea leader of the lebanese forces militia announced 
acceptance of an unconditional ceasefire in his continued showdown 
with aoun for control of the christian enclave north of beirut 
but there was no immediate word from aoun whose troops were 
locked in escalating artillery battles with geageas forces 
earlier geagea called on president elias hrawis army 
commander gen emile lahoud to move his 22000 moslem troops to 
take over aouns bases 
but there was no sign the syrianbacked hrawi would use his 
poorly equipped forces to move against aouns battlehardened 
veterans 
aouns command said the antenna at his tv station in the 
mountain town of beit meri took direct hits in the bombardment by 
geageas forces 
the generals headquarters reported the station went off the air 
at 7 pm when it was hit in a sudden bombardment aimed at 
silencing the voice of truth but it will be back on the air soon 
the statement was broadcast by aouns radio lebanon which 
continued to function 
the maronite clergymen who represent lebanons main christian 
sect met behind closed doors with sfeir as artillery barrages 
thundered in the hills 
their statement also called for a withdrawal by both forces to 
barracks a halt to propaganda warfare an exchange of prisoners 
the reopening of all roads and for aoun and geagea to work out a 
settlement that guarantees the existence of the christians and 
their rights 
fifteen ceasefires negotiated by various parties since jan 30 
have all collapsed 
the bishops told aoun and geagea both maronites that if they 
could not halt the fighting then it is our duty to tell you both 
that your persistence in shouldering the responsibility means 
persistence in wrecking the christians 2000yearold existence in 
lebanon and thus the destruction of lebanon 
geagea said he ordered the media under his control to stop all 
antiaoun propaganda at midnight 
were ready to facilitate all security and political solutions 
on the basis of the unity of all political and military 
establishments under the helm of legitimacy geagea said in a 
statement 
but the fighting continued 
earlier an apartment block in east beirut was set afire by 
phosphorus shells fired by aouns troops in the daylong clashes in 
the christian sector of the divided capital and the kesrouan 
mountains to the mortheast 
but police reported no casualties since the families living in 
the fivestory block were hiding in their basement shelter 
nor were there any reports of casualties in other sectors of the 
christian enclave including the kesrouan mountains where the two 
sides clashed with howitzers mortars and machine guns 
by police count at least 839 people have been killed and 2295 
wounded since jan 30 when aoun moved against geagea in a bid to 
crush the main challenger to his claim to be the sole authority in 
the enclave 
police estimate that about 250000 people onequarter of the 
enclaves population have fled to safer areas in lebanon or left 
the country since the fighting broke out 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
committees report referred to hrawi as the legitimate head of 
state and described an arab leaguebrokered peace plan to end 
lebanons 15yearold civil war as a way leading to peace 
aoun has rejected hrawis election nov 24 to implement the 
peace accord worked out by lebanese lawmakers in the saudi arabian 
resort of taif last october 
the general also rejects the accord because it does not 
guarantee the withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops from lebanon 
they entered lebanon in 1976 under an arab league peacekeeping 
mandate but aoun has branded the syrians an occupation army that 
has sided with his moslem foes 
hrawi is also a maronite the christian sect that has dominated 
key government and military posts since independence from france in 
1943 
aoun refuses to accept hrawi as president because he was elected 
under terms of the peace plan which aoun also rejects his 
opposition focuses on the failure of the plan to include a 
timetable for the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon

some mexican cattle will be given fasttrack 
clearance to enter designated us feed lots because 
droughtshriveled pastures have been reduced to starvation levels 
the agriculture department said wednesday 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said the agencys usual import 
regulations have been temporarily set aside so the cattle can be

tuberculosis 
the usual requirement is that imported animals must come from 
herds that have been tested for the diseases no less than three 
months before the date of us entry with the special waiver the 
mexican cattle will be able to enter approximately three months 
sooner 
the droughtstricken pasture lands in parts of mexico cannot 
support the cattle glosser said by bringing the animals 
temporarily to us quarantined feed lots under strict movement 
restrictions we can avert starvation of the animals and still 
protect the health of us livestock 
glosser said the cattle will be taken directly to quarantined 
feed lots in usdasealed trucks or rail cars they will not be sold 
to any us buyer and will return directly to mexico from the feed 
lots the animals will be kept apart from us cattle while in the 
feed lots which are mostly in texas 
all the cattle imported from mexico still must be found free of 
tuberculosis and all except vaccinated cattle under 24 months of 
age will need to test negative for brucellosis glosser said 
there was no estimate of how many mexican cattle may be imported 
under the special program said agency spokeswoman anita brown

jurors in john m poindexters irancontra 
coverup trial deliberated a third day wednesday without a verdict 
on charges that the former national security adviser lied to 
lawmakers and obstructed congress 
the jury of eight women and four men sent no notes to us 
district judge harold greene that would indicate how the 
deliberations were proceeding 
poindexter 53 a retired navy rear admiral who was president 
reagans national security adviser from late 1985 until he resigned 
as the irancontra affair unraveled in november 1986 is accused of 
five felony counts of conspiracy obstructing congress and making 
false statements 
the indictment charges that poindexter falsely assured congress 
the national security council was not covertly assisting the 
nicaraguan contra rebels at a time when us military aid had been 
banned by congress 
poindexter is also accused of lying by stating that he did not 
learn of us involvement in a 1985 shipment of israeli hawk 
missiles to iran until two months after it occurred 
prosecutors argued that poindexter lied to conceal a politically 
embarrassing presidential finding signed by reagan that 
authorized the arms deal as part of an effort to trade weapons for 
american hostages 
the judge meanwhile denied a defense request to clarify an 
instruction he had given to the jury on tuesday when it asked to 
review more than 5000 copies of electronic messages stored in 
poindexters white house computer backup copies were found in the 
white house computer system 
the indictment charges that poindexter deleted the messages from 
his computer just days before he resigned 
greene told the jury it could not review them because the 
messages known as prof notes had not been admitted into evidence 
in a court filing poindexters lawyers urged greene to clarify 
this instruction saying it may mislead the jury into believing 
that it cannot base its decision upon other evidence about the 
notes 
the judge also denied the defense request that he tell the jury 
that the prof notes were not admitted into evidence because they 
contained classified information 
in a response prosecutor dan k webb said that greenes remarks 
tuesday were sufficient but that he did not object to further 
instructions out of an abundance of caution 
but the language webb proposed for the additional instruction 
contained no mention of the fact the notes were kept out of the 
case because they contained classified information 
the defense is trying to persuade jurors that poindexters 
actions was just a normal security precaution to protect classified 
documents 
in his closing argument last friday defense attorney richard 
beckler said poindexters deletions were the electronic 
equivalent of clearing out his desk 
prosecutors argued that at the time the files were deleted 
poindexter did not know that he would be resigning his job in the 
wake of the irancontra affair

president bush lobbied for senate passage of 
an emergency aid package for panama and nicaragua this week but 
senate majority leader george mitchell left the white house 
wednesday indicating that timetable wont be met 
bush invited more than a dozen senators to the white house to 
congratulate them on wednesdays passage of tougher clean air 
standards 
afterward he summoned mitchell senate minority leader bob dole 
and sen patrick leahy dvt who chairs the senate appropriations 
subcommittee that dispenses foreign aid into the oval office to 
lobby for the panamanicaragua package 
mitchell who on monday accused the administration of taking a 
jigsaw puzzle approach to foreign aid told reporters 
theres no point in worrying about something that we cant get to 
until we deal with the authorization bill 
the authorization bill separate legislation that must first be 
passed before congress can appropriate or actually disburse funds 
isnt moving because republican senators have so far been 
unwilling to permit us to proceed without amendment and in a short 
time limit said mitchell 
weve gotten democrats to agree but republicans have not 
agreed to refrain from offering amendments mitchell said 
we first want to see action on the authorization bill all 
else is speculation said mitchell when we get action on the 
authorization bill then well consider the next step 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater declined comment on the 
meeting calling it private 
bush has been prodding the senate to appropriate up to 800 
million for panama and nicaragua before it leaves thursday on an 
easter recess until april 18 
the house voted for 720 million in aid to the countries 
tuesday panama is rebuilding following the us invasion that 
ended the noriega dictatorship in december and nicaragua will end 
sandinista rule and install democratically elected violeta chamorro 
as president april 25 
mitchell sent secretary of state james a baker iii a letter 
monday asking for a multiyear plan on how the united states should 
spend its entire 14 billion in foreign aid 
i didnt ask for a multiyear bill i just asked for a plan 
that would set forth the context in which this and other requests 
will be considered and its relation to the overall budget said 
mitchell

saudi financier adnan khashoggi was portrayed by 
his lawyer wednesday as a naive businessman who was taken in by a 
deal involving a shipload of gold proposed by former philippine 
president ferdinand marcos 
in his opening arguments at the fraud trial of khashoggi and 
imelda marcos attorney james lynn said his client had committed 
foolish acts in his business dealings but didnt commit any 
crimes 
he used the neverrealized gold deal to explain why khashoggi 
made frequent trips and phone calls to the deposed philippines 
leaders home in exile in hawaii 
khashoggi 54 is charged with mail fraud and obstruction of 
justice for allegedly helping the marcoses hide their ownership in 
manhattan real estate after the philippine government won a us 
court order in march 1986 to prohibit any further transactions 
involving the properties 
linn conceded that khashoggi had many personal dealings with the 
late marcos and that khashoggi had signed one fake document 
involving the buildings but said this was intended to help a 
marcos associate not to defraud anyone 
khashoggi once described as the richest man in the world was 
trying to head off moves by creditors to foreclose on the 
properties linn said 
marcos had offered khashoggi 10 percent of a shipload of gold if 
khashoggi could find a safe port for the vessel preferably in an 
arab country linn said marcos later told khashoggi he had made 
other arrangements for the gold he said 
prosecutors say khashoggi had been in contact with marcos to 
discuss faking documents to show that he not the marcoses had 
actually owned four manhattan buildings allegedly bought with more 
than 160 million stolen from the philippines treasury 
linn said khashoggi was innocent of the charges and had merely 
shown poor judgment in his dealings with the marcoses 
if this wasnt such a serious charge this would be funny 
he said it is not the sinister thing that the government makes 
it out to be 
linn said he would call a handwriting expert to testify that 
khashoggis initials were forged on other documents 
mrs marcos 60 has pleaded innocent to charges of 
racketeering racketeering conspiracy mail fraud and obstruction 
of justice if convicted she faces up to 50 years in prison and 1 
million in fines khashoggi faces up to 10 years in prison and 
500000 in fines if convicted 
the prosecutions first witness a former real estate broker 
with sothebys auction house testified about an art collection 
that marcoses allegedly bought with the embezzled funds 
thomas bryan of fairfax va said the collection of paintings 
furniture and antiques had been housed in the manhattan apartment 
of art collector leslie samuels who hired sothebys to sell both 
the cooperative apartment and its contents after his wife passed 
away 
under questioning by assistant us attorney charles labella 
bryan said mrs marcos first saw the collection in 1981 on a tour 
of the apartment with gliceria tantoco a marcos associate who 
owned a philippine department store 
mrs tantoco and her husband who had been the philippine 
ambassador to the vatican fled after being charged with the 
marcoses 
samuels personally showed them around the apartment and later 
invited them to dinner at his new residence at the waldorf towers 
where mrs marcos also was staying bryan testified 
later that evening after the party had moved to mrs marcos 
rooms for entertainment bryan said mrs tantoco approached him and 
said we are very interested in purchasing the contents and the 
apartment itself 
they negotiated a deal with samuels and agreed on a tentative 
price of 8 million for the apartment and just under 6 million for 
the art collection he said 
at a later meeting bryan said he told mrs tantoco and mrs 
marcos that the apartment could not be bought by a corporation but 
only by an individual who was to be the principal user after the 
two women held a brief discussion he said mrs tantoco asked if he 
would be willing to put his name on the contract 
i said it was not possible due to my current financial 
situation and salary and because the board would have a hard time 
understanding how i came up with the money bryan said prompting 
laughter he said his salary at the time was 27000 a year 
bryan said the art collection was purchased by a corporation 
but the apartment fell through because mrs tantoco was rejected as 
a buyer by the cooperatives board 
when he expressed his regret to mrs marcos about the boards 
denial bryan testified she told him she had purchased another 
piece of real estate that day the genesco building that 
building now called the crown building is one of the four 
properties named in the indictment

the exhibits stretched more than a block in 
two large white tents on the national mall as corporate america put 
its best environmental face on display wednesday 
but some environmentalists werent impressed and members of 
greenpeace were escorted from one of the tents after several 
handcuffed themselves to a support poll near the du pont chemical 
co exhibit 
the us park police said 19 greenpeace members were arrested 
and charged with demonstrating without a permit 
the organizers of earth tech said more than 100 companies 
brought exhibits to the fiveday environmental technology fair 
being held as part of the numerous activities marking earth day 
april 22 
the exhibit and a series of technology forums designed to 
attract members of congress and other government officials were 
estimated to cost about 1 million with participating companies 
paying most of the bill 
the participants included fortune 500 companies such as du pont 
and atampt but also some unknowns such as oil stop inc which says 
it has invented a new type of boom to capture oil spills the 
selfenergizing oil containment system 
its so compact says company official richard lazes that a 
5000foot spool could be put on a tanker and unwound within 
minutes that much boom would have surrounded the exxon valdez 
he says 
while several oil companies are excited about it theyve made 
no commitment yet he said 
producers of solar thermal and windgenerated energy were 
especially prominent as were companies in the rapidly growing 
industry of waste management and disposal and of course 
recycling 
the nature of many of the businesses as well as their 
environmental track record brought criticism from 
environmentalists several conservation groups also put up exhibits 
including the wilderness society and the izaak walton league 
workmen near some of the exhibits were still putting up banners 
including a huge one proclaiming aluminum recycling americas 
environmental success story when across the street members of 
greenpeace denounced the industry effort 
corporate america has begun a campaign to paint themselves 
green said peter bahouth executive director of greenpeace usa 
a nearby banner read dont be fooled industry greenwash 
later several of the greenpeace members entered one of the 
exhibit tent handcuffed themselves a support poll and were cut 
loose by security officers and escorted away 
at the du pont exhibit displays touted the companys efforts to 
push for plastic recycling 
a dummy mr re cycle made of recycled beverage milk and 
detergent bottles sat on a woodlike bench made of recycled 
plastics du pont officials also talked of their efforts to develop 
substitutes for cfcs or chlorofluorocarbons which are damaging 
the stratospheric ozone layer 
greenpeace has been among the environmental groups that have 
criticized du pont and others for not pushing for a replacement of 
cfcs earlier and charge the company is only doing so now because 
the government will ban cfcs anyway 
fair organizers maintained that many of the exhibits demonstrate 
the interest of businesses both large and small to push for 
environmental improvements 
i dont think that you can make anything these days without 
using energy or polluting the environment the question is how 
much said sen john heinz rpa cochairman of the fairs 
organizing committee 
among the exhibits were those that approached the exotic a 
solarpowered car that had traveled across the country a model of 
a wind plant to show that wind power already is generating 
millions of kilowatts of power in parts of california and the 
18electric bulb that lasts seven years wont break and uses 
onefourth less energy than a conventional bulb 
thats equivalent to not burning 400 pounds of coal over the 
life of the bulb said steve waxman of philips lighting co the 
earth light isnt available in hardware stores yet but may soon 
be he said

west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher said wednesday that the soviet union eventually may agree 
that a unified germany should be in nato 
genscher said at a news conference after meeting with president 
bush that he expected international agreement would be completed on 
german unification this year and that the first elections in a 
unified state could take place next year 
he said he expected the soviets would raise their opposition to 
unified germanys membership in the north atlantic treaty 
organization when east and west germany meet with the four major 
world war ii victors in coming weeks 
but genscher said it is my belief that the opinions in the 
soviet union about nato membership have not been finalized and 
that the soviets could be persuaded that it will serve their 
security interests to have a unified germany in nato 
the western allies are convinced it will make europe more stable 
to have germany in nato and that a neutral germany would create 
uncertainty and lead to instability he said 
also countries like poland czechoslovakia and hungary will 
have an influence on the forming of the soviet opinion in this 
respect he said the soviet union will see how this can 
preserve their own security 
genscher said the two german governments were determined that 
unity would threaten no other country and that the legitimate 
security interest of the soviet union will be taken into 
consideration to the fullest 
he reiterated his support for developing a security framework 
for all of europe the united states and canada by working through 
the process built on the 1975 helsinki accords of 35 nations 
pledging themselves to security and cooperation in europe 
but genscher said the german support for such a framework did 
not undermine germanys commitment to nato 
the western alliance will not be in any way abandoned he 
said there is no doubt that the alliance will last a long time 
genscher said the europe economic community also would play a 
major role in fostering stability for the region 
we are more and more convinced that the european community 
will become more and more an anchor of stability in europe he 
said adding that poland czechoslovakia hungary bulgaria 
romania and even the soviet union want the closest possible ties to 
the community and that some even want to become members 
bonn and washington are in complete agreement on all the 
basic issues he said 
one area of difference between the two governments has been over 
us insistence that west germanbased shortrange lance nuclear 
missiles be modernized the west germans say the weapons are 
pointless because they can only hit eastern europe which no longer 
poses a threat to the west 
genscher said the lance didnt come up in his talks 
genscher asked whether soviet reaction to moves for 
independence by lithuania would affect german unification said 
we hope that through responsible actions of all parties involved 
we will get a responsible solution

the doctor treating lee atwater for a brain 
tumor said wednesday the growth is aggressive and dangerous 
and will require chemotherapy in addition to radiation treatment 
in a statement issued through the republican party headquarters 
dr paul l kornblith said that working in atwaters favor were the 
facts that he was in excellent health and the lesion is quite 
small and has been detected early in its development 
atwater was in montefiore medical center in new york city where 
a team of physicians led by kornblith implanted radioactive 
isotopes into the tumor tuesday in an effort to kill the growth on 
the right frontal lobe of atwaters brain 
the procedure took approximately four hours and was 
uneventful said kornblith he added that it was completed 
without apparent impairment to any neurological functions 
although it is obvious that this tumor is aggressive and 
dangerous mr atwater has many factors working in his favor 
kornblith said 
a party official said the 39yearold atwater was receiving 
numerous visitors in a new york hospital wednesday though they had 
to stand behind a lead shield because of radioactivity 
party chief of staff mary matalin said the radioactive device 
would be removed on friday and that recuperation was expected to 
take several weeks 
atwaters wife sally who is expecting to deliver the couples 
third child on monday was in new york with him 
kornblith said the growth known as a astrocytoma was the most 
common primary brain tumor 
it does not spread to other parts of the body but can cause 
damage to brain tissue by pressure and by invasion the doctor 
said 
a brain tumor undergoing unrestrained growth would cause 
pressure within the closed skull this pressure would kill normal 
brain cells thus bringing eventual death by destroying vital 
functions 
brain tumors can also spread by extension into other parts of 
the central nervous system and displace normal cells during such a 
process there would be a progressive loss of function as normal 
brain cells associated with memory thought muscle control and 
even heart beat and respiration are lost 
kornblith said that in order to assure that any tumor cells 
peripheral to the main lesion are destroyed he will be receiving 
chemotherapy as well 
this particular form of chemotherapy is given orally once 
every six weeks and will not limit his activities or functions 
the doctor said atwater will be able to be discharged from the 
hospital in a few days and may well be able to return to work in 
some degree within a couple of weeks 
he will need to be followed closely and may need to have 
additional therapies in the future for the present we are 
delighted with his progress

west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher said wednesday that the soviet union eventually may agree 
that a unified germany should be in nato 
genscher said at a news conference after meeting with president 
bush that he expected international agreement would be completed on 
german unification this year and that the first elections in a 
unified state could take place next year 
he said he expected the soviets would raise their opposition to 
unified germanys membership in the north atlantic treaty 
organization when east and west germany meet with the four major 
world war ii victors in coming weeks 
but genscher said it is my belief that the opinions in the 
soviet union about nato membership have not been finalized and 
that the soviets could be persuaded that it will serve their 
security interests to have a unified germany in nato 
the western allies are convinced it will make europe more stable 
to have germany in nato and that a neutral germany would create 
uncertainty and lead to instability he said 
also countries like poland czechoslovakia and hungary will 
have an influence on the forming of the soviet opinion in this 
respect he said the soviet union will see how this can 
preserve their own security 
genscher said the two german governments were determined that 
unity would threaten no other country and that the legitimate 
security interest of the soviet union will be taken into 
consideration to the fullest 
he reiterated his support for developing a security framework 
for all of europe the united states and canada by working through 
the process built on the 1975 helsinki accords of 35 nations 
pledging themselves to security and cooperation in europe 
but genscher said the german support for such a framework did 
not undermine germanys commitment to nato 
the western alliance will not be in any way abandoned he 
said there is no doubt that the alliance will last a long time 
genscher said the europe economic community also would play a 
major role in fostering stability for the region 
we are more and more convinced that the european community 
will become more and more an anchor of stability in europe he 
said adding that poland czechoslovakia hungary bulgaria 
romania and even the soviet union want the closest possible ties to 
the community and that some even want to become members 
bonn and washington are in complete agreement on all the 
basic issues he said 
one area of difference between the two governments has been over 
us insistence that west germanbased shortrange lance nuclear 
missiles be modernized the west germans say the weapons are 
pointless because they can only hit eastern europe which no longer 
poses a threat to the west 
genscher said the lance didnt come up in his talks 
genscher asked whether soviet reaction to moves for 
independence by lithuania would affect german unification said 
we hope that through responsible actions of all parties involved 
we will get a responsible solution

weapons if israel did the same and signed the 1968 nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty an official said 
the egyptian official speaking on condition of anonmymity said 
tareq aziz of iraq made the offer when he met behind closed doors 
with other foreign ministers of the arab cooperation council the 
egyptian attended the talks 
the organization formed in february 1989 has iraq egypt 
jordan and north yemen as its members 
earlier aziz reiterated accusations that israel is preparing to 
attack iraq and other arab countries 
his comments came after president saddam hussein of iraq 
declared baghdad has binary chemical weapons and will use them 
against israel if attacked 
saddams disclosure monday followed arrests in london last week 
of people accused of trying to smuggle nuclear bomb triggers to 
iraq baghdad denied it is trying to build a nuclear bomb 
the london incident occurred during international clamor over 
the march 15 execution of a londonbased journalist on spying 
charges 
israels motive in this antiiraq campaign is to harm the 
reputation of iraq terrorize us besiege baghdad and then prepare 
to launch an attack on us and other arab nations aziz said 
aziz arrived in amman in response to a call by jordan to hold an 
emergency meeting of council foreign ministers to discuss a 
possible israeli assault on iraq 
the egyptian official said aziz told the ministers iraq was 
willing to give up its arsenal of chemical weapons acquired for 
purely defensive purposes if israel does the same and like iraq 
agrees to sign the nonproliferation treaty 
the egyptian said jordan north yemen and egypt welcomed the 
iraqi proposal 
iraq has signed the 1968 treaty israel believed to be the 
middle easts only nuclear military power has not

foreign ministers of the 22member arab league to discuss the 
details of the tricky game

jordan esmat abdelmeguid of egypt and abdelkarim aleryani of

a bill introduced in congress on wednesday 
would give the bush administration an opportunity to remove aids 
from a list of contagious diseases used to prevent foreigners from 
entering the united states 
the bill was sponsored by rep j roy rowland dga on behalf 
of the national commission on aids the administrations position 
on the bill was not clear 
the federal centers for disease control recently recommended 
that aids be stricken from the list along with several other 
diseases that recommendation is under review by the department of 
health and human services but officials say the department lacks 
authority to remove it 
the bill would give hhs explicit authority over the list 
sponsors said 
the entry restrictions have prompted dozens of international 
organizations and agencies to call for a boycott of the sixth 
international conference on aids in san francisco in june france 
and switzerland also have said they wont send official delegations 
to the meeting 
it seems such a compelling thing said dr june osborn 
chairwoman of the national commission on aids whose members were 
appointed by congress and the white house 
the us is being looked at with such astonishing horror by 
officials and organizations in other countries she said 
under a law passed in 1987 by congress infection with the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids was added to the 
list of contagious diseases for which foreigners can be barred from 
entering the country 
administration officials have said they do not have the 
authority to eliminate the restriction and have done all they can 
within the limits of their power including expediting waivers for 
those who want to attend the conference but they have said that 
since congress directed that aids be put on the list congressional 
action would be required to remove it 
rep henry waxman dcalif one of the cosponsors of the bill 
said that while he believes the administration already has the 
authority to act the legislation would make that authority 
absolutely clear 
the measure would give the hhs secretary authority to decide 
which diseases pose a threat to the public health and would require 
exclusion from the country it does not mention hiv or aids 
we should let health officials make the health decisions 
waxman said that is what we did before 1987 and that is what we 
should continue to do

the soviet union shuffling the top level of 
its foreign service is expected to send a new ambassador to 
washington in time for the june summit meeting betweem president 
bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev administration 
officials said wednesday 
aleksandr a bessmertnykh would replace yuri v dubinin who has 
headed the soviet embassy here since 1986 
dubinin is slated to become the new soviet ambassador to france 
said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
bessmertnykh an urbane experienced and welltraveled 
56yearold expert on the united states canada and the middle 
east is the first deputy foreign minister 
dubinin 59 who came to washington fluent in spanish and 
french swiftly developed facility in english and oversaw the 
opening of the embassy to news conferences and other sessions with 
diplomats and reporters under the glasnost or openness policy of 
gorbachev 
the wavyhaired smiling envoy was a selfdescribed 
popularizer of perestroika the gorbachev program for 
restructuring the soviet economy but he could also take on 
assignments with a hard edge 
as the soviet ambassador to the united nations dubinin in 1986 
blasted the reagan administrations slashing of the soviet staff 
there from 275 to 170 as largescale political sabotage 
bessmertnykh an arms control specialist and a graduate of the 
moscow state institute of international relations is considered 
particularly close to soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze who began three days of talks wednesday with 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
a specific date for the bushgorbachev summit to be held in 
washington is expected to be decided upon during shevardnadzes 
visit 
bessmertnykh who confers regularly in moscow with us 
ambassador jack f matlock jr accompanied shevardnadze to 
washington for the talks which will culminate friday with a 
meeting with bush at the white house 
his prospective reassignment as the soviet ambassador to 
washington is part of a revamping of the principal overseas 
assignments in the soviet foreign service it is not considered a 
reflection on dubinin who succeeded longtime soviet ambassador 
anatoly f dobrynin both envoys were known for their affability 
dubinin who entered the soviet foreign service in 1965 
evidently was not accorded the special status by the reagan and 
bush administrations that dobrynin enjoyed in the nixon years 
dobrynin was used by secretary of state henry a kissinger also 
the national security adviser during the detente era of the 1970s 
as a special channel to the kremlin 
bessmertnykh who served here from 1970 to 1983 is responsible 
in the foreign ministry for canada and the middle east as well as 
for us affairs he was named chief of the foreign ministrys 
usa department in 1983 and was elevated to the post of first 
deputy foreign minister in october 1988

lair the armed forces high command said in a statement over 
state radio chad 
trucks with loudspeakers rolled through the capital calling on 
chadians to assemble thursday to condemn the libyan aggression 
the islamic legion has been attacking chad from sudans darfur 
province an area over which the sudanese government exercises 
virtually no control 
the radio played military music following an initial

the government on wednesday formally introduced 
its controversial bill that would grant british citizenship to an 
estimated 225000 hong kong chinese 
it faces stiff opposition and possible defeat by a rare union of 
the socialist labor party which considers the bill elitist and 
rightwing legislators in the governing conservative party opposed 
to mass immigration 
the bill was presented to parliament hours after prime minister 
margaret thatcher said britain had a solemn duty to the colony 
before it reverts to china in 1997 
thatcher said that giving key people a safety outlet was 
essential to prevent a crippling brain drain over the next seven 
years and to keep the prosperity going in hong kong 
but former conservative party chairman norman tebbit said as 
many as 80 rightwing tories have threatened a revolt against the 
government 
the labor partys leadership on wednesday night voted 
unanimously to oppose the bill deputy leader roy hattersley said 
it granted citizenship on the basis of wealth power and 
influence and would not achieve its objective of keeping key 
people in hong kong 
hong kong is subject to british rule under a 99year lease with 
china signed in 1898 hong kong will revert to chinese control on 
july 1 1997 under terms of a joint declaration signed by britain 
and china in 1984 
the british nationality or hong kong bill allows the home 
secretary to grant citizenship before june 30 1997 up to 50000 
hong kong residents recommended by the governor of hong kong under 
a selection scheme to be approved by parliament 
citizenship also will be granted to the spouses and young 
children of the key residents foreign secretary douglas hurd has 
estimated this will bring the total to 225000 people 
under the bill hong kong governor sir david wilson will appoint 
a committee to advise him on the citizenship issue most of the 
50000 will be chosen on a points system 
the measure was given a formal first reading in the house of 
commons but the first major test will come in the second reading on 
april 19 
home secretary david waddington said he was confident the bill 
would be adopted 
i am sure we will persuade enough members of parliament to 
carry the measure waddington told channel 4 tv news 
but conservative opponents already were gearing for battle 
the government are about to do something which i never thought 
i would live to see legalizing an activity which was criminal 
namely creating a market in passports said robert adley 
chairman of the britishchinese parliamentary group 
the employment market will be distorted by jobs to which 
british passports are attached this scheme is going from the 
bizarre to the bazaar adley said 
in 1989 42000 people left hong kong and 55000 are expected to 
leave in 1990 he said 
about 325 million hong kong chinese now have british passports 
but no residence rights

surgeon general antonia novello said wednesday 
it is important that adolescents be taught about aids but 
communities must decide for themselves how to do that 
what is good for iowa might not be good for new york she 
said you always have to take into consideration the state 
where they live what is the morality of that particular community 
and what is the incidence of aids in that community 
she said that while some parents object to aids education 
because they feel their children are not at risk at least some 
education has to be going on 
you at least have to have the data out there she 
said but you have to make sure its done with sensitivity 
and in the cases in which monogamy and abstention doesnt 
work then the adolescent should know that the condom in the 
absence of a vaccine might be the most common available form of 
prevention 
novello also said an educational aids brochure discussing condom 
use a project begun more than two years ago at the department of 
health and human services will be released soon critics had 
charged that conservatives in the department were trying to derail 
the publication because it discussed condoms 
jim brown a spokesman for the surgeon general said the 
pamphlet has been reviewed by all levels at the department and is 
on its way to the printer 
novello a pediatrician and the first woman and hispanic to 
become surgeon general met with reporters and answered questions 
on a range of public health issues on many issues though she 
said she has not formed an opinion since she has been on the job 
only about a month 
on questions about abortion she toed the bush administration 
line saying it should not be allowed except in cases of rape 
incest or danger to the life of the mother 
she also stood by the department of health and human services 
ban on federal funding of fetal tissue transplantation research 
saying that such research could increase the incidence of abortion 
she said she will add her voice to that of hhs secretary louis 
sullivan in campaigning against smoking she said she does not 
favor banning tobacco advertising because advertising is 
freedom rather the industrys ads need to be countered with 
prevention messages she said 
novello said she also is worried that women might get too 
complacent about the risk of aids since far fewer women have 
acquired the disease than men 
from june 1981 through february 12370 cases of aids in females 
have been reported compared with 112614 cases in men according 
to the centers for disease control

pan am took more than eight months to correct 
serious security lapses at west germanys frankfurt airport after 
the bombing of flight 103 top federal aviation officials testified 
wednesday 
the chairwoman of a presidential commission looking into the 
december 1988 bombing that killed 270 people at lockerbie 
scotland sharply criticized the federal aviation administration 
for allowing the problems to persist for so long 
ive never seen anything like this in my life chairwoman 
ann mclaughlin told faa administrator james busey who said part of 
the problem was that the faa was leaderless during part of the 
period after the bombing busey took office in july 
ms mclaughlin said that was an absolutely unacceptable 
excuse for failure to get pan am to correct problems at frankfurt 
where the bomb may have been placed aboard the flight the faa is 
responsible for overseeing security of us airlines in the united 
states and abroad 
pan american world airways chairman thomas plaskett who also 
testified at the commission hearing said the airline followed 
inspection procedures approved by the faa the airline is 
contesting 630000 in fines levied by the faa last september for 
security lapses related to flight 103 and five other european 
flights around the same time 
the latest allegations however have never been the subject of 
fines 
faa security chief ray salazar and associate administrator monte 
belger testified that frankfurt inspections after the bombing 
revealed security problems that werent corrected until september 
1989 
salazar denied sworn statements in depositions by pan am 
officials that he gave them permission to xray checked luggage as 
an alternative to requirements that it be matched to passengers at 
frankfurt 
investigators believe a bag was loaded at frankfurt containing 
the bomb that blew up the airliner after the flight changed planes 
in london 
belger said he was extremely frustrated by repeated 
inspections at frankfurt that continued to show uncorrected 
problems in checking personnel who service pan am airliners and 
other lapses 
but he said that after top faa and pan am officials met in 
august and sent a team to frankfurt the airlines security at the 
airport became a model for the industry

a new study shows that the drug widely used 
to treat genital herpes is effective in treating chickenpox in 
children but one doctor cautions that its side effects should be 
weighed heavily 
according to a report in this months journal of pediatrics 
acyclovir reduced the number of itchy blisters and shortened by a 
day the normal fiveday course of chickenpox in 50 twin cities 
children who received the drug in pioneering trials 
but dr john f modlin of johns hopkins university school of 
medicine in baltimore said he was worried that rare and toxic 
reactions to the drug would become widespread in chickenpox 
patients the reactions include kidney failure and neurological 
disorders such as slurred speech disorientation and seizures 
i want to stress all in all that acyclovir is a very safe 
drug modlin said its a good drug and largely nontoxic but 
when you give it to thousands of children there will be some who 
develop unusual toxicities 
the most important question that has to be asked is how 
important is it to treat chickenpox in otherwise healthy children 
with a drug 
dr henry balfour the pediatrician who headed the university of 
minnesota study said the study found no serious side effects and 
he predicts eventual widespread use of the drug which is also used 
to treat genital herpes 
balfour said there is room for dialogue about the treatment 
but he said the burden is on the skeptics to prove whether 
risks outweigh benefits 
we dont know about rare side effects and that is true 
balfour said but what there is to lose is definitely less than 
what there is to gain 
he said doctors shouldnt wait for federal drug administration 
approval of acyclovirs specific application for chickenpox 
because acyclovir already has fda approval as an antiviral drug 
doctors are free to use it as a chickenpox treatment based on 
research 
the drugs effectiveness in shortening the normal duration of 
chickenpox is important because most complications develop near the 
end of a typical fiveday infection balfour said 
about 4000 american children are hospitalized each year from 
complications of the disease which can range from skin or ear 
infections to pneumonia or brain infections balfour said about 
100 to 200 die from the disease each year according to data from 
the centers for disease control 
you cant tell at the outset which child is going to be the 
one of every 4000 that get hospitalized balfour said im 
more over on the extreme that you should treat all the children 
he said some doctors may delay prescribing acyclovir until 
results of a larger 10city study are released probably later 
this year other doctors may limit the use of acyclovir to 
youngsters 11 and older who tend to have the most severe cases of 
chickenpox balfour said 
the study sponsored in part by burroughs wellcome co 
manufacturer of acyclovir was carried out from february through 
june 1987 testing for immunity and analysis took two years

panama lashed out at its latin 
american neighbors on wednesday accusing them of flagrant 
intervention in calling for new presidential elections 
seven countries told panama last week that it should schedule 
elections to legitimize the government of president guillermo 
endara 
endara became president in december when a us invasion ousted 
gen manuel antonio noriega who annulled last years election 
results when it was clear endara was beating noriegas candidate by 
a 3to1 margin 
president endaras regime doesnt emanate from that military 
action it comes from the will of the panamanian people foreign 
minister julio linares said wednesday at a news conference 
no country has the right to dictate the rules of the game to 
us he added 
foreign ministers of mexico colombia venezuela peru uruguay 
brazil and argentina meeting as the rio group in mexico city sent 
panama a communique friday calling for elections respect of 
hemispheric diplomatic asylum accords and limits on foreign army 
activities within its borders 
linares said the request is a flagrant act of intervention in 
our affairs 
i dont think any selfrespecting country would recognize 
it he said 
he called the latin countries request unjust and 
unconnected with the truth 
linares said panama plans a referendum on constitutional reforms 
that will demonstrate the acceptance of the government the vote 
could be scheduled in january or february he said 
eightyfive people sought asylum in foreign embassies during the 
invasion and panama has denied safeconducts to five linares said 
the five are wanted for killings and misuse of funds he said 
urging the rio group to recognize panamas right under multilateral 
accords to deny asylum on those grounds 
he also said it is up to panama to decide about foreign troop 
movements within its territory where the united states has bases 
linares comments last week deepened a rift between mexico and 
panama over each governments legitimacy 
after the rio groups demand endara told mexico that its ruling 
party the institutional revolutionary party uses electoral fraud 
to maintain power that provoked a protest on monday from mexicos 
foreign ministry 
in the latest exchange wednesday panama told mexico that both 
countries should get over their differences but blamed mexico for 
starting the fight 
the unjustified attacks to which the legitimate and legally 
constituted government of endara has been subjected and his 
reaction to them were the cause and effect of situation that both 
sides should overcome panama said in a letter to the mexican 
embassy

the nations press is too comfortable too 
wellpaid too much part of the establishment for the countrys own 
good the president of the american society of newspaper editors 
told colleagues wednesday 
we often think of ourselves as davids fighting the 
establishment but the public sees us more and more as statusquo 
establishment goliaths said loren ghiglione publisher and 
editor of the southbridge mass news 
he cited a poll showing most people think that news 
organizations are under the influence of powerful people and 
organizations 
ghiglione addressing the societys 67th annual meeting 
proposed that editors each adopt an institution that makes us 
uncomfortable a prison a mental institution a noisy 
overcrowded bigcity school an aids hospital ward and try to 
work in that world or at least understand it 
he told of his own experieces removing his glasses his belt 
his watch and his shoes as he was admitted to a number of prisons 
in the past year while taking part in an asne study of prison 
journalism each time he said he vowed not to do it again but 
in an era of lawandorder electricchair politics i know i 
should go back 
while we say we comfort the afflicted and afflict the 
comfortable we need to guard against looking at the world 
increasingly through the eyes of the comfortable ghiglione said 
arguing that newspapermen have lost touch with their readers 
one poll showed that half of newspaper journalists earn over 
40000 a year but only 18 percent of the public does he said 
and many of us live in almost exclusively white middleclass 
worlds and send our children to private or suburban public 
schools 
he argued that the world needs editors who will fight he 
said that newspapers need to examine their own failings should 
hire fact checkers like those who work for magazines and have 
reporters check their stories with sources for accuracy and he 
said the press should quit participating in societys lies 
through such devices as printing pseudoscientific horoscopes as 
news you can use 
another speaker david halberstam an author and prizewinning 
reporter told the editors that the demands by owners of newspapers 
and newspaper company stocks for everrising profits are putting 
newspapers in jeopardy 
theres a question of how much water you can bring out of the 
stone halberstam said at what point are you taking out more 
than youre putting in 
i think the threat to us is not from the outside not from the 
government not from television it is from ourselves 
in another report roy aarons an executive with the oakland 
calif tribune presented the results of the first survey ever 
undertaken of homosexuals on the news staffs of us papers he 
said 205 openly gay newspaper people volunteered to take part 
but only 13 percent agreed to be publicly identified 
by overwhelming majorities these journalists find that 
coverage of gay and lesbian issues other than aids is at best 
mediocre aarons said 
like other minorities before them they would like to see gay 
coverage veer from the sensational and toward portrayal of gays as 
part of the fabric of our communities he said 
just as newspapers failed to employ blacks to report on the 
black community until the riots of the 1960s erupted he said 
todays papers are not taking advantage of the viewpoints of their 
reporters who are gay while scrambling to stay on top of this 
rapidly evolving social issues 
domestic partners legislation gay adoption 
antidiscrimination laws fundamentalist attacks on the gay 
lifestyle morality and public responsibility and of course the 
stillraging aids epidemic have brought onceeasily ignored issues 
into demanding focus aarons wrote in his report of the survey 
nearly a third of the participants said they found the term 
homosexual to be prejudiced explaining that it refers narrowly 
to sex whereas the term gay refers to lifestyles or issues 
many newspaper editors are homophobic one reporter told 
aarons asne committee their antigay opinions however subtle 
or private are a reflection of their systematically antigay 
upbringings most of the rest are afraid to publicly challenge the 
status quo how else to explain the scarcity of openly gay 
newspaper executives editors and columnists the insufficient 
number of articles on gay people and the epic silence that follows 
every civil rights setback for gay people america would rather 
keep homosexuality invisible and americas newspapers are 
complicit 
another participant wrote that she heard reporters and top 
editors on her paper make snide homophobic comments and jokes 
regularly and added that they were the same people who wrote 
those sensitive stories and editorials

secretary of state james a baker iii told 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze on wednesday that 
how moscow deals with the drive for independence in lithuania holds 
very important consequences for superpower relations 
bakers strong statement at the conclusion of a 3 hour session 
at the state department at the opening of a new round of 
ussoviet talks elicited a public assurance from the 
shevardnadze that the kremlin would find a peaceful solution in the 
baltic republic 
let me tell you very authoritatively and seriously i have no 
doubt we will be able to find a solution to that situation that we 
will find a wise and fair solution shevardnadze said 
he added without elaboration that it would be in the interests 
of the lithuanian people the entire soviet union europe and peace 
at the conclusion of the first of three days of scheduled talks 
baker said shevardnadze had brought a letter for president bush 
from soviet president mikhail s gorbachev baker declined to 
disclose any of the contents saying that was up to bush who will 
meet with shevardnadze at the white house on friday morning 
the two ministers also discussed nuclear missiles they hope to 
agree on the extent of the limitations to be placed on 
nucleartipped cruise missiles in a treaty bush and gorbachev would 
like to sign at a summit meeting here in june 
but the dramatic disagreement between lithuanians determined to 
have their own nation and a kremlin determined to avoid splintering 
the soviet union drew most of the public attention 
this is a very very important matter baker said i have 
pointed out to the minister how very important it is in terms of 
the relationship between the united states and the soviet union 
baker said there was no disagreement with shevardnadze with 
respect to its importance and with respect to the importance of 
resolving it through dialogue and through peaceful means 
earlier baker told reporters he was encouraged that the soviets 
seemed to be considering a referendum in lithuania to determine its 
future 
a referendum is of course one way for parties to express 
selfdetermination baker said before he escorted shevardnadze to 
his 7th floor office 
we will be exploring the question of the degree to which there 
is in fact the beginning of some dialogue in moscow baker said 
baker said he intended to ask shevardnadze about the 
cancellation of scheduled meetings between lithuanians and 
officials of the soviet interior ministry shevardnadze however 
seemed to be unaware of such scheduled meetings 
what happened today i have no information yet the foreign 
minister said through an interpreter 
later neither baker nor shevardnadze gave any indication how 
the matter was resolved 
but responding to a question before his meeting with baker the 
foreign minister insisted the soviets had not used force to deal 
with the secession movement in lithuania 
of course he said in any country in any state measures 
are taken in order to have order in order to have a normal 
situation and this is this elementary order that is being 
established 
the state department lobby was cordoned off and dozens of 
uniformed guards and security agents in civilian garb kept watch a 
guard with a german shepherd dog stood at the entrance 
on capitol hill lawmakers pushed bush to take a stronger stand 
on lithuania 
house members voted 4163 to approve a resolution urging the 
president to reaffirm his commitment to an independent lithuania 
and take steps to normalize diplomatic relations between washington 
and lithuania 
the resolution which carries no legal weight is similar to one 
passed earlier by the senate 
meanwhile 31 senators told bush in a letter that us warnings 
against the use of military force in lithuania have not been 
effective the administration the letter said must spell out the 
consequences moscow will face if more force is used 
the bakershevardnadze sessions are expected to produce a date 
for bushs washington summit meeting with soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev us officials said several options were being 
considered for holding the summit before the soviet peoples 
congress in moscow in early july 
were pretty flexible on dates fitzwater said 
the administration has been banking on a peaceful solution to 
tensions between lithuania and the kremlin over the independence 
movement 
a referendum is a starting point on the road to independence 
which we support said a us official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
a law passed by the supreme soviet on tuesday provides that the 
first step in a secession process would be for a republic to hold a 
referendum if the referendum gets the necessary twothirds 
approval a transition period of no more than five years ensues 
the soviet constitution itself has allowed secession but 
without a legal mechanism to carry it out 
the official said the new procedure could give the lithuanians 
and the soviets time to resolve economic and political questions 
raised during the independence drive and that it might not take 
five years 
baker was buoyed by the meeting alexandr n yakolev a close 
adviser to gorbachev held in moscow on tuesday with a delegation 
of officials from lithuania and the pledge of an honest 
dialogue by shevardnadze in an arrival statement tuesday 
there would appear at least to be the beginnings of such a 
dialogue baker said we are encouraged as well that we see 
references coming from both sides to the concept of the possibility 
of some sort of a referendum approach 
lithuanian leaders told the kremlin last week that they were 
ready to discuss the issue of a referendum on secession if 
gorbachev agreed to talks the soviet leader having demanded the 
nullification of a march 11 declaration of independence did not 
respond immediately

president bush called on the black majority in 
south africa on wednesday to follow the example of slain civil 
rights leader martin luther king jr and renounce violence 
in a speech on the anniversary of kings 1968 assassination 
bush also predicted that one day not far off a black person 
will be president of the united states 
when that day comes the most remarkable thing about it will 
be how naturally it occurs he said in remarks to the 20th 
anniversary dinner for the joint center for political studies a 
nonprofit research organization that focuses on blacks in politics 
and society 
he used the occasion to call for an end to the state of 
emergency imposed by south africas white minority government and 
the freeing of all political prisoners there 
most of all there must be an end to the tragic cycle of 
violence a task that demands great courage and resolve from all 
south african leaders black and white bush said 
most tragically the senseless violence perpetuated by blacks 
against blacks has become a major impediment to rapid progress 
toward a negotiated settlement he said all sides should 
follow the spirit of mare senatepassed measure to the presidents desk 
for his signature 
president bush is expected to sign the measure which would 
require the justice department to keep data on crimes related to 
victims race religion sexual orientation or ethnic group it is 
supported by a variety of civil rights ethnic and police groups 
actually the house already had passed the measure and this time 
merely consented to minor changes made when the senate approved the 
bill on feb 8 
crimes that would be counted are murder nonnegligent 
manslaughter forcible rape aggravated assault simple assault 
intimidation arson and destruction damage or vandalism of 
property 
first proposed in 1984 by rep barbara kennelly dconn the 
legislation grew from a series of arson incidents at synagogues in 
kennellys central connecticut district 
authorities were never able to determine that racial or religiou 
prejudices led to the crimes 
some supporters say the measure is needed because of a rising 
tide of hate crimes on the part of neonazi skinheads and other 
such groups although there is no certainty that such offenses are 
on the increase 
a may 1988 justice department report said an accurate count is 
not available but it said these types of offenses are far more 
serious than comparable crimes that do not involve prejudice 
because they are intended to intimidate an entire group 
estimates of the cost to collect the information have ranged 
from 1 million a year to 10 million a year the justice 
department has said it would have no trouble making hate crimes 
part of its annually published uniform crime reports 
the bill was brought to the floor tuesday night and debated but 
the vote was delayed until wednesday there was no debate on 
wednesday 
the only lawmaker to rise in opposition to the bill was rep 
william dannemeyer rcalif who portrayed it as a concession to 
the gay community 
believe me whether we like to accept it or not there are 
persons outside this chamber who are crowing namely in the 
homosexual community he told the house 
he said homosexuals now have something in the law which they 
have sought diligently for the last 20 years whereby they will 
equate homosexuality on a part with the traditional coverage of the 
1964 civil rights act

former president jimmy carter praised plo chairman 
yasser arafat at the end of two meetings wednesday for what he said 
were arafats efforts to advance peace in the middle east 
he has done everything possible these last months to promote 
the peace process carter said after a 90minute private meeting 
at the hotel crillon hes explored all the possibilities to make 
progress toward a total peace settlement 
a jovial arafat told reporters the peace process was given a new 
impetus by the crillon meeting with carter and one earlier 
wednesday that included president francois mitterrand 
i met the former president of the united states the architect 
of camp david who constructed the peace treaty between the largest 
arab country egypt and israel said the leader of the palestine 
liberation organization he consulted with president bush 
before coming 
arafat described carter as a personality of great stature 
he said carter offered no new proposals but their talks touched on 
all mideast issues 
carter spokeswoman melissa montgomery denied reports in the 
french press that carter was on a special mission for bush 
carter accused middle east leaders of dragging their feet on the 
peace process 
the problem is among the leaders who dont adequately 
represent the concerns of the people for peace in israel among 
the palestinians the syrians the jordanians the lebanese 
carter said 
he called peace inevitable 
the former president accompanied by his wife rosalynn shook 
arafats hand as they left elysee palace following the meeting 
including mitterrand 
at his news conference arafat delivered a stinging attack on 
the emigration of soviet jews to israel 
israeli leaders predict hundreds of thousands of soviet jews 
will arrive in israel the next few years the plo fears they will 
settle in the occupied west bank and gaza strip where the plo 
hopes to establish an independent state 
holding aloft a crudely drawn map of a jewish state expanded by 
immigration and extending into saudi arabia arafat said a 
greater israel would be an obstacle to peace no one can stop 
jews from emigrating from the soviet union but we are opposed to a 
massive transfer he said 
he praised advice given to israel by bush and secretary of state 
james a baker iii to keep occupied territories offlimits to 
soviet jewish immigrants 
carter and arafat arrived for overnight visits arafat is 
expected in rome on an official visit thursday and his third 
meeting with pope john paul ii carter was going to oslo norway 
carter told reporters that he arafat and mitterrand discussed 
delays in the peace process and how it could be rejuvenated we 
had a common hope that these delays might now be overcome 
arafat said wednesdays meetings proved that peace initiatives 
are not only palestinian that they are international 
jewish leaders objected to arafats meetings in paris the head 
of a coalition of french jewish groups jean kahn demanded a 
meeting with carter saying he wanted him to explain his talks with 
arafat 
police vans lined the place de la concorde and at least 200 riot 
police stood guard near the hotel on the edge of the place where 
arafat was staying 
about 50 youthful jewish demonstrators clashed with a halfdozen 
hecklers at the place during rushhour traffic at least one person 
was injured but there were no arrests 
we are against the visit of the terrorist arafat here said 
edwin sberro a student and member of the betar tagar zionist 
movement carter shouldnt talk with a terrorist like arafat 
israel regards the plo as a terrorist organization and refuses 
to negotiate with it 
a meeting between arafat and carter had been expected for days 
but mitterrands office made a surprise announcement wednesday that 
the french leader would play host for initial talks 
arafat last came to paris in may 1989 when he met mitterrand 
and declared that the pl0 charter was caduc a french word 
meaning either outdated or null and void 
as president carter oversaw the negotiation of the 1979 camp 
david accords that led to peace between israel and egypt carter 
recently concluded a middle east tour of israel syria egypt and 
jordan

one of space shuttle atlantis fuel 
cells probably was damaged because excessive pressure was exerted 
when the unit was being prepared for removal nasa said wednesday 
the extent of damage was not immediately known said dick young 
a spokesman for the national aeronautics and space administration 
there are enough other fuel cells in the system for flight and 
any damage will not affect atlantis next mission in july atlantis 
returned to kennedy space center on march 13 following a secret 
pentagon mission to send a 500 million spy satellite into orbit 
fuel cells provide electrical power to space shuttles through a 
reaction between liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen 
one of the fuel cell units 96 individual cells had failed a 
voltage test during a postflight checkout march 31 young said 
nasa decided to remove the entire unit and return it for repair 
to the vendor international fuel cells of hartford conn young 
said the unit had been purged with gaseous helium following the 
march 31 test and residual gas pressure was being vented out 
wednesday 
as the operation proceeded it became apparent that the oxygen 
vent was working but the hydrogen vent was not nasa said in a 
statement issued wednesday night it was discovered that a cap 
had been placed on the vehicles hydrogen vent port possibly as a 
conclusion of the march 31 electrical test 
the procedure was halted immediately and the area was cleared 
of workers as a safety precaution young said 
the oxygen and hydrogen sides of the fuel cells are divided by a 
plate an eighth of an inch thick containing potassium hydroxide a 
corrosive chemical used as an electrolyte pressure normally is 
kept higher on the oxygen side of the cell to keep the potassium 
hydroxide from seeping through 
young said the potassium hydroxide likely was forced into the 
oxygen side of the cell causing the difference in pressure on 
either side to exceed allowable levels that could affect the fuel 
cells operation and corrode the oxygen piping he said 
the fuel cell will be removed as soon as possible young said 
young said nasa planned to appoint a review board to investigate 
the matter he declined to comment further

key members of the house energy and commerce 
committee negotiated behind closed doors late wednesday in an 
attempt to craft a compromise on the acid rain provision of a clean 
air bill 
a day after the senate approved a sweeping air pollution control 
bill of its own the focus of the debated shifted to the house 
where the committee is trying to work out final details of similar 
legislation 
rep john dingell dmich the panels chairman said he hopes 
remaining issues can be settled this week and a final committee 
vote taken that might lead to house floor action on the bill early 
next month 
rep philip sharp dind floated a revised proposal aimed at 
helping midwest utilities cope with tough new acid rain pollution 
controls the proposal involved a complex system of pollution 
allowances and was similar to a provision already in the senate 
bill according to committee sources 
but as of 10 pm edt the measure was still being discussed and 
sources said it was unlikely a final agreement could be reached 
before thursday 
the senate voted 8911 late tuesday in favor of a sweeping clean 
air bill that imposes new emission controls on automobiles 
factories and electric power plants the bill was a product of a 
compromise agreement between senate leaders and the white house 
president bush at a white house meeting congratulated senate 
leaders for helping us at last break the legislative logjam on 
clean air but called it only a first step 
more progress is going to be needed if were to achieve the 
balanced bill that is essential bush said he said the white 
house would keep pushing in the house and in the eventual 
conference committee for changes to ensure cleaner air without 
major job loss 
neither industry nor environmentalists have been happy about the 
senate legislation with environmental groups calling it inadequate 
to solve urban smog problems and industry charging its toxic 
chemical controls and acid rain provisions are too expensive 
senate majority leader george mitchell meeting with reporters 
on wednesday said he would have preferred that it were stronger in 
some areas including tougher secondround controls on automobile 
emissions 
but mitchell called the bill strong and comprehensive 
mitchell said he knew early on that he did not have enough votes to 
stop a filibuster on the original senate bill and concluded the 
only way to enact the legislation was to work out a compromise with 
the bush administration 
we did what was necessary to pass the bill said mitchell 
mitchell indicated that he intended to push for some 
improvements he favored when the bill goes to a conference 
committee to be reconciled with the eventual house legislation 
much of the fight in the house however was expected to revolve 
around the strong acid rain control measures included in both the 
house and senate legislation 
both bills call for a 10 million ton reduction in the annual 
releases of sulfur dioxide from coalfired electric power plants 
the curbs will hit midwest utilities especially hard because they 
rely heavily on highsulfur coal and have some of the dirtiest 
plants 
a group of congressmen led by rep philip sharp dind has 
sought to include in the house bill a cost sharing measure to 
ease the financial burden of cleaning up the midwest plants 
the senate provided some help by allowing midwest states special 
pollution allowances that could be sold to other utilities but 
generally rejected as has the white house further costsharing 
ideas 
dingell has proposed some costsharing options and sharp was 
continuing to pursue a proposal calling for a fee on industrial 
polluters of sulfur dioxide which are not covered by the acid rain 
provision to offset the costs to utilities 
if the acid rain issues can be resolved there appears little 
impediment on getting the bill out of committee before congress 
goes on its easter recess at the end of the week a congressional 
source suggested dingell said he hoped for a final vote thursday 
or friday

bill aimed at easing the nations aids crisis 
this ones for you ryan sen edward m kennedy dmass 
said in a telephone conversation with whites mother jeannie 
after the labor and human resources committee approved the 
comprehensive aids resources emergency act the bill which has 
bipartisan support would provide an additional 600 million a year 
for two years to combat acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
whites physician dr martin b kleiman said there was still 
cause for hope 
hes holding on his status deteriorated in the first day or 
two and then reached a plateau kleiman said any patient who 
is critical must stabilize before he can recover and ryan has 
stabilized 
there have been patients who have been this ill and have 
recovered the doctor said we can maintain patients at this 
level for prolonged periods of time 
white is on a lifesupport system he has been unconscious and

an object of scorn in his hometown of kokomo into an international 
spokesman for aids patients he fought a successful court battle to 
attend school and helped reinforce the message that aids cannot be 
spread through casual contact 
i was stunned when i heard he was back in the hospital said 
kokomo resident ron shanks i just figured hed keep on living i 
hope he can pull through 
i hope he pulls out of this said david rosselot the 
attorney hired by a group of western middle school parents to keep 
white out of school 
in 1985 rosselot pressed a lawsuit that relied on a state law 
barring children with communicable diseases from attending school 
the attempt of the parents at that time was not to keep ryan 
white out of school the intent of the lawsuit was to keep acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome out of school he said 
rosselot said he would not take a similar case today 
i dont think that anybody in kokomo feels good about what 
happened said art peirce an 18year resident of kokomo 
i think its something that had to happen he said the 
fear had to be expressed and if hadnt happened here it would have 
happened somewhere else

a confident smiling premier li peng asserted 
wednesday that chinas leadership is united and strong and that the 
public does not want a renewal of the massive prodemocracy 
protests of last year 
lis comments to reporters were his first since the protests 
were crushed last june also wednesday the chinese parliament 
wrapped up its twoweek annual session with measures calling for 
freer business practices but tougher law and order policies 
the 3000seat national peoples congress which largely 
rubberstamps decisions by top communist party and government 
officials also gave final approval to the basic law under which 
hong kong will be governed after britain returns it to china in 
1997 
legislators in hong kong immediately said the law was not 
democratic enough and asked that it be amended 
li was among top leaders on the rostrum at the congress final 
meeting in the great hall of the people afterward he told the 
annual postcongress news conference that the session was 
inspiring and heartening 
the army killed hundreds and possibly thousands of people in 
june while crushing the prodemocracy movement 
while other officials have lost their tempers while answering 
foreign reporters questions about the killings li merely smiled 
and refused to answer 
isnt this question out of date he said when asked who gave 
the army the order to shoot at protesters 
li predicted that beijings tiananmen square at the center of 
the protests would remain peaceful thursday that is when chinese 
celebrate the qing ming festival a day to honor the dead 
exiled chinese dissidents had urged beijing residents to mourn 
those killed in june by strolling in the square thursday they 
urged similar action last sunday but chinese authorities closed 
the square to the public all day and held an official rally there 
and on thursday police again cordoned off tiananmen square on 
the nearly deserted 100acre square authorized groups of 
flagwaving schoolchildren joined soldiers for rites marking 
chingming while police guards kept out the general public 
we do not hope to see a repeat of last years chaos nor do 
the chinese people hope to see a repeat of it li said wednesday 
we believe tiananmen square will pass the day in an orderly way 
some beijing work units have barred employees from wearing black 
armbands or white flowers of mourning thursday the city has 
limited the number of people who can visit crematoriums where the 
ashes of the dead are stored 
li asked about his chances of being reelected in 1993 said he 
did not consider himself extremely capable but said rumors in 
hong kong that he was in political trouble were bad guesses 
the core of leadership in china with party general secretary 
jiang zemin as its nucleus is united and strong and i believe it 
commands the support of the chinese people he said 
he rejected a political comeback for zhao ziyang who was ousted 
as general secretary in june for allegedly supporting the 
prodemocracy protests he said zhao was still being investigated 
by the party but had not been stripped of his membership zhao is 
living at home in very good conditions and in good health li 
said 
zhao who favored negotiations with the protesters was last 
seen publicly on may 19 when he visited the demonstrators in the 
square 
before adjourning the national peoples congress amended the 
joint venture law to allow foreigners to become joint venture 
chairmen and ruled out nationalization china hopes the changes 
will attract more foreign investment which has fallen since the 
army crackdown 
the legislature also passed a resolution calling for 
strengthened public security national unity and education in 
patriotism collectivism socialism and national defense 
under the basic law for hong kong the territory ruled by 
britain since 1842 is promised a high degree of autonomy within 
china and protection of its capitalist economic system for at least 
50 years however many of hong kongs 57 million residents fear 
the guarantees are not strong enough and they already are 
emigrating to escape communist rule 
the colonys legislature voted 206 on wednesday to ask china to 
change the law before 1997 chinas national peoples congress must 
approve any changes the hong kong legislature wants faster 
progress on direct elections and eventual direct election of all 60 
members of the hong kong legislature 
the law provides for a 60seat local legislature in which 20 
members could be directly elected at first 24 members in 1999 and 
30 members in the year 2003 it also sets up a complicated 
splitvoting procedure that gives appointed legislators power to 
veto controversial bills 
after hong kong residents loudly supported last years massive 
prodemocracy protests on the mainland china added provisions for 
declaring a state of emergency in hong kong it also banned 
subversive activities and contacts between hong kong and foreign 
political groups

hundreds perhaps thousands of people killed when the military 
stormed the city last june to wrest control of tiananmen from

police said wednesday they are checking 
into reports that the fiery crash of a small plane may have been 
the result of a suicidebound passenger who struggled for control 
of the craft 
the cessna 421 golden eagle streaked over the foothills west of 
boulder on sunday slammed into a tree then destroyed a vacant 
house four garages and six parked cars engulfing a large section 
of the residential block in flames killed were gordon larry hood 
45 and the pilot james wilford bill layne 56 police said 
eyewitnesses reported that the plane flipped onto its side and 
went into a power dive behavior that might reflect a struggle 
going on in the cockpit said police spokesman david grimm 
was the pilot overpowered was the pilot shot was the pilot 
stabbed we just dont know grimm said as far as we can tell 
right now the pilot just happens to be the unfortunate person who 
got hired that day 
police asked the national transportation safety board to allow 
them back into the crash site after two outofstate acquaintances 
told investigators that hood was suicidal grimm said 
the sources gave us information when we spoke to them that 
there were indications made to them that mr hood was potentially 
contemplating suicide and in a manner similar to what occurred 
grimm said 
we thought we were investigating an air accident and it has 
turned into something else 
authorities released hoods identity wednesday saying he is 
believed to be from atlanta but had recently moved to the denver 
area they believe hood was a photographer 
layne an employee of intensive air care a denverbased private 
charter company had taken hood to granby a mountain community 
about 80 miles northwest of denver and the two were returning to 
denver when the plane crashed 
we dont necessarily get the impression that there was 
physical struggle going on grimm said it could simply have 
been a struggle over control of the aircraft 
autopsy results released tuesday showed hood and layne died of 
injuries suffered in the plane crash and not from other causes 
according to tom faure chief medical investigator of the boulder 
county coroners office 
grimm said hood was seen carrying a briefcase into a post office 
in granby and investigators believe he mailed some cards or 
letters there 
police are asking anyone who may have received mail from hood to 
contact them

the government says it is finally getting a 
handle on how many secrets it creates each year 
its best guess is that the top secret secret and 
confidential stamps were wielded 6796501 times in the fiscal 
year that ended last sept 30 
that was a 35 percent decrease from the year before but the 
gains are somewhat illusory 
it appears that this unprecedented drop is primarily the 
result of more accurate counting rather than an actual tremendous 
decrease in classification activity said steven garfinkel head 
of the information security oversight office created in 1982 when 
thenpresident reagan rewrote all the rules for classifying

bush called his appeal a laserlike request to help panama and 
nicaragua and state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said failure to pass the package quickly would threaten the 
fledgling democracies and be like playing with dynamite

something as seemingly innocent as a prayer apparently can be 
explosive when involving the taut feelings of palestinians and 
israels jews that combustible mix has set off a holy week furor 
it was ignited by a prayer prepared by the middle east council 
of churches and distributed to us church leaders along with the 
councils request that it be read in palm sunday services this 
weekend 
the prayer seems to be extremely provocative recalling the 
worst uses of christian holy week as a club against jews says 
the rev elliott wright of the us national conference of 
christians and jews 
protests also came from jewish organizations the dutch council 
of churches and protestant churches in west germany reportedly have 
declined to approve use of the prayer 
the middle east council of churches embracing heavily 
palestinian denominations proposed this sundays prayer as the 
start of a 50day linking of world churches in prayers for holy 
land peace culminating on pentecost june 1 
the rev gabriel habib the councils general secretary said in 
a letter presenting the plan 
we hope that the solidarity in prayer will emphasize both 
the tragedy of the situation the denial of the rights and dignity 
of the palestinian people and the faith that the grievous 
wrongs can be righted 
as for wording of the opening prayer itself it probably would 
seem thoroughly innocuous to most christians even blandly typical 
at least on casual reading but critics point out its stickier 
connotations 
it is a thinly veiled attack on the state of israel in 
liturgical form said the american jewish committee adding that 
using the prayer would inject a divisive and polarizing element 
into christian services 
wright senior vice president of the national conference of 
christians and jews which for a half century has worked for 
interfaith partnership said the prayer could cause 
jewishchristian tensions in us communities 
it is a carefully constructed ideologically subtle 
document he added sentences and paragraphs do not always end 
up where you think they are headed 
he said some consider the prayer a propalestinian political 
statement combined with a narrow exclusive theological point of 
view 
rabbi a james rudin the ajcs interreligious affairs director 
and the associate director judith h banki said the prayer is 
filled with mischievous inuendos 
criticism of the 400word prayer focused mainly on three 
paragraphs one of them dealing by implication with a palestinian 
state but not specifying it saying in part 
we come to jerusalem and we see that people remain in 
agony and suffering strengthen those who have been deprived of 
the right to live in dignity free them from oppression 
restore to them the right to life and to independence in their own 
land 
rubin and ms banki said the wording makes the reckless and 
unjustified claim that palestinian arabs are being deprived of 
their very right to life by israel 
such language implies that the physical destruction of the 
palestinian community is the goal of policy of israel this is a 
malicious slander 
another criticized paragraph refers by implication to israelis 
without naming them saying in part 
we come to jerusalem and we see that there are those who 
live in fear free them from the illusion that depriving others 
of their rights or even eliminating them will provide security or 
reaffirm selfidentity 
the other criticized paragraph refers to jerusalem itself and 
projects its unity in one body equated with christianity 
saying 
when we neet in you jerusalem as one body carrying the 
good news and when we bring to realization your justice on earth 
then will jerusalem become the community of all believers 
rudin and ms banki pointed out that many noted christian 
theologians have publicly repudiated such religious 
triumphalism and added 
we strongly believe that jeruslaem is today in fact a 
community of all believers jewish christian and moslem 
the proposed prayer was distributed in this country to heads of 
denominations and to local ecumenical councils by the us national 
council of churches including most major protestant and eastern 
orthodox bodies 
but it stated in a covering memorandum that the material 
clearly reflects the perspective of the middle east council of 
churches and was being sent at its request 
wright said it was uncertain whether us denominations would 
pass the text on to congregations although indications were that 
some local councils planned events around the prayer 
i expect that everyone would agree that prayer is in order for 
peace between israelis and palestinians wright said efforts 
to counteract antisemitism in no way diminish concern for the 
palestinians and for a genuine and lasting peace in the area

in private the administration acknowledged 
long ago that there is no realistic prospect for the deployment of 
new shortrange nuclear missiles in germany but the project 
remains on the table a devalued bargaining chip in arms control 
talks abroad and budget negotiations at home 
in both settings rival negotiators know that the modernized 
missile plan is obsolete west germany doesnt want the weapons 
deployed on its soil and that will go double in a reunified 
germany 
on a redrawn postcold war political map they will be missiles 
without logical targets anyhow but the project remains in the 
budget at 112 million this year and a total cost estimated by 
the administration at 12 billion if it were to be completed 
the weapon involved would be a missile called fotl because it 
hasnt been issued a name of its own fotl means follow on to 
lance the lance is a shortrange missile now deployed in germany 
and four other nato nations it will be obsolete by the middle of 
the decade and the alliance has been talking about modernization 
the nuclear missiles were deployed to buttress outnumbered nato 
troops in the event of a soviet ground attack into western europe 
modernizing that missile force was a contentious issue even before 
the political upheavals that transformed eastern europe toward 
democracy brought down the berlin wall and effectively dismantled 
the old soviet satellite empire 
when president bush went to his first nato summit 10 months ago 
missile modernization was a problem bush proposed sharp cuts in 
conventional forces east and west and the alliance avoided the 
nuclear missile quandary by putting off a decision on modernization 
until 1992 
in addition the 1989 nato compromise calls for negotiations to 
reduce the battlefield nuclear missiles but not to eliminate them 
totally after there is eastwest agreement on reduction of 
conventional forces and those cuts have started to take place 
that shelved the question past the west german parliamentary 
elections scheduled late this year the compromise nearly a year 
ago avoided an issue that would have been a problem for chancellor 
helmut kohl antinuclear sentiment had been growing in west 
germany since the 1987 treaty to scrap intermediaterange missiles 
that pact left the shortrange missiles defined as those with 
ranges up to 310 miles as the only ones in the nato neighborhood 
and west germany is the site for almost all of them 
the current force of lance missiles has a range of about 70 
miles nato has 88 shortrange nuclear missile launchers the fotl 
project is to turn out missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads 
up to 280 miles with 1000 of the weapons planned at an expected 
total cost of 12 billion 
but all of that was drafted for use against a communist bloc 
that has been transformed new governments in eastern europe are 
pressing for soviet troop withdrawals and president mikhail s 
gorbachev has agreed to them east germans have elected a new 
government shaped to hasten the process of reunification 
the west germans didnt want nuclear missiles on their soil 
aimed at other germans even when the presumed targets were in 
communist territory they certainly arent going to accept them now 
the bush administration is said to be considering changes in the 
plan for new shortrange missiles a topic that will have to be 
dealt with when nato defense ministers meet next month in alberta 
canada 
there may not be many options short of dropping the whole notion 
the chairmen of the armed services committees in both the house 
and the senate have said congress wont appropriate more money for 
weapons the west germans wont accept 
a study by defense experts and members of congress in both 
parties concludes that the modernization plan should be dropped 
that report issued by the johns hopkins foreign policy institute 
says the funds could be better used elsewhere in the defense budget 
and the conservative defenseoriented heritage foundation 
advocates cancelling the missile program and relying on an 
airlaunched tactical missile to serve the battlefield purpose if 
necessary 
for one thing german opposition to having this weapon on 
german soil is mounting and may be nearuniversal the heritage 
study concludes for another the nato assumptions on which the 
need for fotl has been based are that nato conventional forces are 
inferior to the warsaw pact and that a clear front line exists 
between two germanies 
both assumptions probably will not be valid for long

when you set out to evaluate a mutual fund 
financial advisers say its useful to be aware that you are aiming 
at a moving target 
certainly a given fund you have in your sights may have been 
traveling the same course with the same stated objective for a 
long time with an extensive performance record to boast about 
but many things about a fund remain subject to unpredictable 
change its size and maneuvering ability for example or the 
identity of people manning its helm 
as a result funds cannot automatically be presumed to be fixed 
quantities with relatively interchangeable characteristics the way 
some other securities such as treasury bills or bank certificates 
of deposit can 
this point was driven home late last month when peter lynch 
manager of the enormously successful fidelity magellan fund 
announced plans to leave his job at the end of may 
though he has been running magellan the nations largest mutual 
fund with more than 13 billion in assets since 1977 lynch is 
just 46 years old 
it was easy for people in the moneymanagement business to 
assume that when you bought magellan shares you got lynch to manage 
your money for some indefinite period of time the resident star 
was unquestionably a prime reason for the funds allure 
so when lynch stepped down pleading a desire to do other things 
with his life that an everincreasing work load wouldnt allow it 
naturally caused a lot of commotion and uncertainty 
because of lynchs renown this has been the most celebrated 
case of its kind in recent memory but it is hardly the only one 
fund history contains many instances of star managers 
sometimes running funds set up specifically to package their 
reputed genius abruptly departing for other endeavors 
furthermore thats just one of several ways in which a fund can 
change important parts of its identity usually a fund prospectus 
sets out limits to this sort of thing by declaring that no 
fundamental switch in philosophy or objective can be made without a 
shareholder vote 
but even given such strictures changes of many types can happen 
routinely for example donoghues moneyletter of holliston mass 
recently deleted a couple of respected growth funds from its 
recommended list because they had raised their sales charges from 3 
percent to 475 percent 
though that kind of move may not concern existing shareholders 
much it could give pause to anyone making periodic new investments 
in a fund it is certainly worthy of note for anyone contemplating 
a firsttime purchase 
what to do when a development as dramatic as lynchs departure 
comes along most experts agree it is a matter of individual cases 
and preferences rather than blanket rules 
for magellan shareholders in particular says the bostonbased 
united amp babson investment report we suggest staying with it 
especially if you have been in the fund a while and thus would feel 
a sharp tax bite if you switched 
united amp babsons analysts recommend keeping a close watch on 
the results achieved by lynchs designated successor morris smith 
who has chalked up a winning record running another smaller 
fidelity fund 
meanwhile investors have seen a live demonstration of an 
enduring principle in mutual funds the game can change even when 
the name is the same

it was a public relations coup that would have 
made their late chairman proud 
the editors at forbes magazine tried to upstage competitor 
fortune this week by issuing a new and improved list of americas 
biggest companies the same day fortune trotted out its latest 
edition of the venerable 500 
it was the kind of rascality that made the late malcolm forbes 
famous he was no doubt smiling down on the effort which the 
forbes staff managed to pull off before the magazine containing the 
list was even off the presses 
not since forbes parodied its other main competitor business 
week by spoofing its cover for a 1987 issue on executive pay has 
the businessmag competition produced such high jinks 
forbes spokesman ray healey must have had tongue in cheek when 
he explained in a telephone interview that the simultaneous release 
of dueling forbes and fortune lists was simply a coincidence 
like its pure accident when time and newsweek have the same 
cover story on say madonna 
healey who handles press relations for forbes magazine was 
able to get the jump on the competition through a combination of 
slick packaging and logistical wizardry 
first the magazine distinguished its list of 500 big companies 
with a socalled super 50 described as the most powerful firms 
over a broad spectrum 
that was to differentiate the forbes list from fortunes a list 
of the 500 largest industrial firms ranked by sales forbes rated 
all public companies retailers financial services 
manufacturers you name it by sales profits assets and stock 
market value 
second healey crunched a version of the forbes list on his 
personal computer copied it to a computer diskette and dispatched 
press kits to the news media before the magazine was printed the 
information on the diskette could be dumped directly into a news 
agencys computer system eliminating the need to handpunch the 
data from the list 
fortune filling the role of tortoise to forbes hare sent 
copies of the actual magazine to the press along with other facts 
about the 500 in paper press releases 
the result both lists got the ink their creators sought 
although perhaps not in the manner they envisioned the associated 
press for instance led its story on the lists by noting the 
obvious competition between the two 
at least they agreed on whos on first general motors corp 
the only company with more than 100 billion in annual sales led 
both the fortune and the forbes rankings 
but you need more than fast footwork to make real news with a 
list while forbes grabbed a headline with its nifty 50 fortune is 
sure to have the last laugh 
fortune has been at the 500 for years and years its part of 
the language observed fortune managing editor marshall loeb 
forbes has been anxiously and eagerly trying to catch up with 
us he said but frankly ive never heard anyone in 
conversation say were part of the forbes 500 
the fortune editor is exactly right once something is 
established as a standard its hard to push aside thats why we 
still measure in feet not meters or why a coach advises a kid to 
eat his wheaties not total 
its not that the forbes list is any less ambitious or 
newsworthy than fortunes forbes in a sense does more than 
fortune by measuring companies on four separate scales 
its just that for some lists the franchise is locked up 
fortune has the 500 business week has its executive pay survey 
forbes for its part has the richest 400 americans no substitutes 
will do 
of course that wont stop the list purveyors from purveying 
more lists it seems as if every other issue delivers a fresh 
register for us to peruse 
some journalists would say the public is definitely overlisted 
but the appetite for such trivia appears insatiable malcolm 
forbes himself must share part of the blame for this lopsided 
demand curve he was the one at forbes several years ago who 
dreamed up the richest 400 against the vociferous protests of 
some forbes staffers healey notes 
three decades after fortune spawned the list business with its 
first 500 news magazines have turned the ranking of the biggest 
and richest into a cottage industry and lists have become the 
doritos of business journalism 
so crunch all you want theyll make more

the news from the nations capital was 
somewhat encouraging fewer people taken into police custody 
tested positive for cocaine but around the country law 
enforcement officials say they see no sign that drug abuse and 
trafficking are abating 
the situation is bleak in that cocaine is still readily 
available in the united states despite very significant and very 
effective law enforcement initiatives both domestically and in 
latin america said frank shults a spokesman for the drug 
enforcement agency 
a dea survey last september and october revealed that the price 
of cocaine at the kilogram level has increased slightly moving 
from 13000 to 14000 in los angeles he said 
unfortunately he said this doesnt mean theres a cocaine 
shortage 
we attribute it to price gouging at low and midlevel 
trafficking and individuals who are taking advantage of the users 
fear of a shortage shults said 
he said the fear stems from some significant law enforcement 
advances 
the colombian governments crackdown on drug trafficking has 
disrupted operations of the medellin cartel 
the price of coca leaf paid to farmers in bolivia and peru has 
dropped to 5 to 10 per hundred pounds far below the growers 
breakeven point of 30 per hundred pounds the price drop occurred 
because of the colombian crackdown an oversupply of leaf more 
efficient processing techniques and better controls of chemicals 
used to make cocaine he said 
the seizure of 20 tons of cocaine at one los angeles warehouse 
in the fall combined with several other major busts around the 
country 
nevertheless the purity of cocaine at the kilo level has 
remained high approximately 84 percent throughout the united 
states shults said at the street level there has been a slight 
decrease in purity but officials attribute that also to a 
perception of a shortage rather than an actual one 
as it turned out the decline in the percentage of washington 
dc arrestees who tested positive for cocaine was temporary 
justice department and local officials said the temporary drop may 
be attributed in part to the arrest of one major trafficker and the 
disruption of his operation 
law enforcement efforts have changed drug dealers tactics but 
there is no nationwide trend police officials say 
in some areas crack houses have given way to open air markets 
to reduce the amount of drugs and money that police can seize in a 
single bust 
in east st louis ill for example drugs were sold a few 
years ago primarily at homes known to locals as drug emporiums and 
all deals were done behind closed doors according to the chief of 
detectives lester anderson 
now he said money and drugs are exchanged onstreet corners in 
broad daylight known there as curb service 
even in los angeles where crack houses once dominated the 
market for that drug there has been a slight and recent trend 
toward deals on the street said sgt tim beard of the county 
sheriffs narcotics unit the reason to avoid detection and to 
implicate as few people as possible in the event of a bust 
but the reverse has happened elsewhere 
in washington dc law enforcement officials said dealers have 
closed some open air markets to avoid easy arrest 
in dallas onthestreet drug trafficking today is not as 
blatant as in past years when dealers were standing on the 
streets waving down customers said capt doug kolwalski who 
heads the police departments narcotics division 
efforts by officials to increase public awareness and encourage 
neighbors to report drug dealing have paid off he said as a 
result drug dealers have become more discreet 
the same is happening in new york city where dealers are 
becoming more selective in who they sell to said capt robert 
cividanes of the police narcotics division 
many move to offstreet locations and employ steerers the 
captain said 
in broward county fla were seeing smaller quantities on 
the street because the police are catching these people and the 
dealers dont want to lose large quantities said robert deak 
commander of the countys drug task force 
deak said dealers are adjusting their sales techniques depending 
on law enforcement tactics 
as we do more of the sweeps they do tend to move inside the 
buildings he said but as we do search warrants they move out 
of buildings 
john rothlein commander of the metro dade police narcotics 
unit described the ebb and flow of drug markets as a cat and 
mouse game 
in denver capt rudy sandoval of the police vice and narcotics 
bureau said weve still got crack houses but theyre 
underground theyre not on the street bothering people like they 
used to 
the street drug market in new orleans has changed but the 
overall situation hasnt improved said capt chuck ladell chief 
of detectives 
there are more of them now but they are more discreet 
ladell said 
despite some increases in prices for kilos of cocaine street 
prices have remained relatively stable averaging 100 a gram 
nationwide police said 
denver had some good news for those who believe cocaine use has 
at least stopped growing 
dr stephen dilts director of emergency alcohol drug and 
psychiatric treatment at denver general hospital said the number 
of patients showing up in the emergency room with cocainerelated 
problems appears to be leveling off after years of steadily 
increasing 
over the past few years weve seen an increase in the number 
of cocaine addicts but no particular increase in the last year 
dilts said

general motors corp was the titan of corporate 
america last year despite tough foreign competition and cutthroat 
rebates that squeezed the nations big three automakers according 
to fortune and forbes magazines 
with nearly 127 billion in sales and 42 billion in earnings 
in 1989 gm garnered first place on the fortune 500 and forbes 
super 50 lists released tuesday 
the fortune 500 as familiar on main street as on wall street 
ranks the nations largest industrial firms by sales forbes ranks 
all public companies by sales profits assets and stock market 
value 
both magazines have issued 500 rankings for years but tuesday 
was the first time in recent memory that the lists were released 
the same day in an effort to upstage its competitor forbes topped 
its rankings with a socalled super 50 which it described as the 
most powerful companies across all four categories 
the fortune 500 had a profit decline in 1989 after years of 
strong growth reflecting the slowdown in industrial america 
behind gm fortunes top 10 were ford motor co exxon corp 
international business machines corp general electric co mobil 
corp philip morris cos chrysler corp ei du pont de nemours 
amp co and texaco inc 
rounding out the top 10 of the forbes super 50 were ge exxon 
ibm ford philip morris american telephone amp telegraph corp 
mobil du pont and sears roebuck and co 
the fortune 500 list appears in the april 23 edition and is 
available on newsstands wednesday forbes released its ranking two 
weeks before it is to hit the stands in the april 30 edition 
its a horse race every year said forbes spokesman ray 
healey describing his magazines rush to beat its rival 
information of this kind is old in a matter of minutes as soon 
as we have it locked in solid we send it out 
marshall loeb fortune managing editor dismissed the 
competition 
fortune has been at the 500 for years and years its part of 
the language ive never heard anyone in conversation say were 
part of the forbes 500 
fortune 500 sales jumped 7 percent to a record 216 trillion in 
1989 but overall earnings fell 82 percent to 1056 billion in 
the previous two years profits among the big manufacturers had 
climbed an unprecedented 79 percent 
median profits fell in nine of fortunes 27 industry groups and 
only 264 of the top 500 companies had earnings growth down from 
327 in 1988 
pharmaceuticals had the largest median increase in earnings up 
196 percent followed by beverages 183 percent textiles 153 
percent food 14 percent and electronics 10 percent 
the motor vehicles and parts industry suffered the largest 
median earnings decline down 25 percent followed by aerospace 
down 125 percent petroleum refining down 118 percent 
transportation equipment down 94 percent and computers down 9 
percent 
fortune said six of the 10 largest industrial companies suffered 
doubledigit earnings declines including a 66 percent drop at 
chrysler whose ranking dropped a notch from 1988 
despite topping forbes earnings list gms profits fell 13 
percent last year fords profits fell 28 percent in 1989 to 384 
billion but still ranked as the third highest after gm and general 
electric forbes said 
in the 1960s and 1970s back before global competition became 
so intense and incessant the earnings of the 500 companies 
invariably rose as long as the domestic economy was growing not 
any more fortune said 
foreign competition especially from the japanese was 
particularly acute in the motor vehicles and parts industry which 
ranked as the poorest performer by nearly every measure of 
profitability according to fortune that sector also was hurt by 
high interest rates and rebates 
gm had by far the largest profit during 1989 while no 46 sun 
co an energy business had the biggest profit jump up 1300 
percent 
maxxam inc an alumunium products and lumber company which 
soared to 184th place from 485th had the biggest sales increase 
up 3667 percent according to fortune 
another big jump occurred because of time incs acquisition of 
warner communications inc for 14 billion the combined time 
warner fortunes parent company jumped from no 102 to no 59 
foreign takeovers bumped several companies off the list among 
the casualties were smithkline beckman corp which merged with 
britains beecham group plc in an 8 billion deal pillsbury co 
bought for 58 billion by britains grand metropolitan plc and 
combustion engineering inc acquired by swiss giant abb asea brown 
boveri 
among the 39 newcomers were lyondell petrochemical which 
debuted at 93rd on the fortune 500 list

forbes magazine has taken a shot at competitor 
fortune with a new list that forbes claims more accurately ranks 
the most powerful american corporations 
dubbed the super 50 the forbes list ranks the biggest us 
companies based on their acrosstheboard strength in sales 
profits assets and the market value of their stock 
the new list was introduced on tuesday the same day fortune 
released its venerable 500 list 
forbes derided the fortune list which is limited to industrial 
companies ranked by sales alone as onedimensional 
it claimed the super 50 best identified the companies 
financial as well as industrial with the capital the resources 
and the financial stamina to compete in world markets 
its a horse race every year said forbes spokesman ray 
healey describing his magazines effort to compete with fortune

digital equipment corp launched an 
assault on the computer industrys hottest market introducing its 
most powerful workstations slashing prices on other models and 
vowing to take the lead in open systems 
digital showed off over 20 new computers peripherals and 
software products tuesday including a 3d desktop workstation it 
claimed is the industrys highest performing model 
the maynard massbased company is playing catchup in 
riscbased workstations and systems based on nonproprietary 
open operating software but it took a feisty stand in the 
first major product announcement at its silicon valley facility 
in addition to price cuts on its entire family of riscbased 
workstations the cheapest is now 5950 along with servers and 
ultrix software the company said it has improved discounts and 
will offer finders fees for thirdparty sales 
all of this reinforces our primary message said donald 
gaubatz digitals group manager for workstations we intend to 
be number one in the open systems market and we are doing what it 
takes to achieve that goal 
wall street apparently liked what it heard and sent digitals 
recently depressed shares up 250 to 7962 the price was over 
100 last fall 
sales of workstations powerful desktop computers are 
expected to grow 35 percent this year to 81 billion according to 
san josebased dataquest inc 
leading companies like sun microsystems inc hewlettpackard 
co digital and big newcomer international business machines 
corp have been bringing out new models and cutting prices relative 
to performance 
thats good news for the businesses banks and engineering 
companies that are the main buyers of workstations 
this market is going to be hotly competitive for a very long 
time said barry willman an analyst with new yorkbased sanford 
c bernstein amp co who attended digitals introduction 
the companies are prepared to aggressively defend the 
installed base theyve already developed and are aggressively 
focused on building that base he said adding that digital 
appears to be embarking on a price war 
given how aggressively digital was comparing themselves to 
hp sun and ibm i would expect those other vendors not to be 
silent in the face of that attack he said 
digitals pursuit of market share comes at a time when it also 
needs to bolster profits analysts predict the companys revenues 
for the fiscal year ending june 30 will barely exceed last years 
127 billion and earnings will drop for the second year in a row 
this time by 70 percent 
the new products most of which are ready for shipment arent 
expected to have an impact on revenues until the 1991 fiscal year 
the company has been cutting overhead with a severance program 
aimed at reducing its 126000 employees by 8000 
until last year digital was ambivalent about its commitment to 
open industry standards such as american telephone amp telegraph 
cos unix software and risc or reduced instruction set computers 
now the company says that segment of its business will soon 
match its vax workstations and proprietary vms software lines 
domenic lacava digitals vice president for low end systems 
said the company expects incremental growth in its vax 
workstation business and that over time the ratio of risc 
workstations to vax workstations will level out 
over this next year we should see something approaching 
5050 he said the risc line is starting to take off 
dramatically we have seen the order rate double and triple in 
weekly orders over the last three or four months 
computer hardware analyst kevin landis of dataquest was 
impressed but not overwhelmed by the capabilities of digitals new 
5000 series workstations which start at 14995 
it doesnt cleanly leapfrog everybody but its good said 
landis its a significant step for them to go to open systems 
and step away from their traditional line theyre making a lot of 
tough choices it represents a strategic leap for them 
willman said the new computers peripherals and software 
significantly broaden their product line from a performance 
standpoint and also significantly improve their price 
competitiveness in the market 
digital cites research by international data corp in 
framingham mass that shows digital is only slightly behind 
workstation market leader sun microsystems and ahead of 
hewlettpackard which recently bought apollo computer inc 
dataquests kathleen hurley says digital holds just under 20 
percent of the market and is third behind hewlettpackard 
in any event all of the big three workstation leaders have to 
contend with a potentially invasive rival ibm 
ibm last month brought out a line of workstations it said would 
snare a major share of a market in which it never had success 
the machines called the risc system6000 represented the first 
time ibm has wholeheartedly embraced the unix operating system

half of the new core management team at general 
motors corp comes from the productside of the automobile 
business a change that should help the company rebuild its market 
share analysts say 
the team led by chairmanelect robert stempel takes control 
aug 1 the day after roger b smith retires as gms 10th chairman 
smith said tuesday 
stempel now the companys president also will become its chief 
executive officer in august 
i think mr stempel will take a very hands on interest in the 
north american turnaround said auto analyst scott merlis of 
morgan stanley amp co of new york there will be a lot of 
continuity in that 
smith who became chairman on new years day 1981 and stempel 
who became president on sept 1 1987 have worked closely over the 
past few years trying to fend off an assault by archrival ford 
motor co and japanese companies on the companys north american 
market share 
stempel said tuesday that defending and recapturing the lost 
share was his top goal 
there is no higher priority in general motors than increasing 
our market share profitably he said 
joining stempel 56 in top leadership positions will be 
lloyd reuss 53 executive vice president in charge of north 
american auto operations he will succeed stempel as president 
john f smith 51 executive vice president in charge of gms 
international operations he will become one of two vice chairmen 
robert j schultz 59 gms executive vice president in charge 
of the companys gm hughes electronics corp electronic data 
systems corp and gms technical staffs he will become the other 
vice chairman 
no one will assume stempels title as chief operating officer 
there currently are no gm vice chairmen 
in a sense this whole thing is kind of a reassignment of 
titles said auto analyst david healy of the brokerage 
barclaysbzw in new york i think its probably notable for how 
little change there is rather than how much 
its also notable that it is product guys rather than 
financial types or marketing types who really have pretty much all 
the top jobs now he added 
i thought it was very important to have this organization 
stempel said of his team and recognize the importance i attach 
personally to our technical operation eds and hughes and 
worldwide operations and then of course the strength we have in 
north america 
during the nine years of smiths reign gms share of the north 
american car and truck market has fallen to 346 percent at the end 
of last year from 441 percent in 1980 
but there are other problems stempel must tackle immediately 
i guess the one thing that one has to do if one is ascending 
to the top of gm is lower expectations said analyst joseph 
phillippi of shearson lehman hutton in new york bob stempel 
hasnt got any magic bullet that he can whip out of his holster and 
point and solve the problem of market share 
what hes going to have to do is set a leadership tone that is 
going to get that organization turned around 
a key to gms hopes for market share recovery is its 
muchballyhooed saturn corp the division is scheduled to begin 
production this summer in spring hill tenn of a compact car 
aimed directly at japanese models 
the 3billion project also is serving as a laboratory for new 
manufacturing and labor relations techniques 
but perhaps the most significant test in stempels first days as 
chairman will be this summers negotiations with the united auto 
workers 
we remind mr stempel that gms single most valuable resource 
is a capable and dedicated work force that seeks to build the best 
products it is capable of building uaw president owen bieber and 
vice president stephen yokich head of the unions gm department 
said in a statement 
merlis and other analysts have long urged gm to look to its 
successful european operations for leads in turning around its 
north american business 
stempel joined gm in 1958 as a senior detailer in the oldsmobile 
divisions chassis design department he rose through the ranks in 
oldsmobile and pontiac until he was appointed managing director of 
adam opel ag in west germany 
the key message here is that gm has a fivemonth new car 
waiting list in europe and has nothing but product successes 
there merlis said now your chairman and vice chairman john 
smith have had experience in europe 
theyre well positioned to crossfertilize the lessons learned 
overseas to north america

a shareholder upset by the last temptation 
of christ is urging other holders of mca inc stock to tell the 
company not to make films that might offend religious groups 
the proposal was included in proxy materials sent to 
shareholders this week ahead of a vote at the companys annual 
meeting may 8 in chicago 
a supporting statement for the proposal says last temptation 
showed jesus as a disturbed man who frequents brothels 
hallucinates seeing snakes vows that he always tells lies acts 
only as a result of fearand feels tormented by god 
the proposal made by stockholder dean shahinian of alexandria 
va calls for shareholders to censure mca for antichristian 
effects 
we urge management to establish a corporate policy not to use 
corporate assets to falsely defame jesus christ or other major 
religious leaders it says 
mca urged shareholders to reject the proposal saying that 
censoring a film because it contains an unconventional religious 
viewpoint could stifle religious and creative expression 
noting that martin scorsese won a best director oscar nomination 
for temptation mca said the film was scorseses interpretation 
of a novel not the companys view of christ 
the proxy materials also disclosed that mcas top executives 
were awarded hefty compensation last year 
film chief thomas pollock was given mca stock worth 57 million 
in 1989 and stock options worth 78 million when issued last 
august 
pollock also was paid a base salary of 627000 bringing his 
total compensation to more than 14 million his salary was raised 
to 850000 this year 
sidney sheinberg president of the universal citybasedmovie 
tv music and theme park giant was issued stock worth 72 million 
last year his salary jumps from 729000 in 1989 to 900000 mca 
chairman lew wassermans salary also jumps to 900000 from 
559000 
the shareholders will vote on a new stock option plan under 
which pollock was given his options 
the plan authorizes the issuance of 5 million new shares 
600000 of which would become available to pollock at 55 a share 
over the next five years he may exercise 20 percent of the options 
once per year beginning this july 
mcas stock was trading at 68 a share when they were awarded 
last august it has since fallen in value closing at 5050 on the 
new york stock exchange tuesday at that level pollock would lose 
money by exercising his options 
mcas last stock option plan was approved in 1968 but never 
exercised the company said the new plan was needed to provide 
competitive compensation for mca executives 
that was a reference to corporations like the walt disney co 
whose chairman president frank wells made 724 million on the sale 
of stock bought through options in 1989

here are the key provisions of clean air 
legislation passed by the senate 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
requires states and local authorities to develop pollution 
control plans to reduce urban smog and bring air quality in more 
than 100 cities within federal health standards timetable for 
meeting the standards ranged from five to 15 years with los 
angeles getting 20 years because of the severity of its problem 
smogcausing pollutants or ozone are reduced through controls 
on automobiles and industry with annual pollution improvements of 
4 percent a year required over first six years 
automobiles 
tougher tailpipe emission requirements by 1995 cutting 
hydrocarbon releases by 22 percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by 
66 percent 
cleaner fuels for all automobiles in nine cities with the worst 
pollution the nine cities are los angeles houston new york city 
milwaukee baltimore philadelphia hartford conn san diego and 
chicago 
special canisters on auto fuel systems to reduce emissions 
during refueling 
industrial sources 
sources emitting 100 tons of smogcausing pollutants must 
install new smog control technology although a waiver may be given 
in some cases if pollution control costs exceed 5000 per ton 
current law requires controls on tailpipe emissions but curbs 
widely believed to be inadequate to meet air quality standards amid 
growing number of cars on the road despite law more than 100 
cities fail to meet federal air quality standards 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
requires industrial plants to install best available technology 
to control the release of about 200 hazardous chemicals linked to 
cancer nervous disorders and birth defects that affects a wide 
range of industries including oil refineries chemical plants 
smelters dry cleaners and paint shops 
the epa now regulates only seven chemicals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
requires annual sulfur dioxide releases to be reduced by 10 
million tons by 2000 roughly cutting such emissions in half 
it allows utilities to buy and sell pollution credits among 
themselves as long as total reductions in emissions are not 
affected extra allowances are given to midwest utilities and some 
clean plants to ease the cost burden and allow for future 
growth 
nitrogen oxide releases which also contribute to acid rain 
must be cut by 27 million tons 
it will affects 107 coalfired electric power plants with 
midwest utilities using highsulfur coal facing greatest pollution 
reduction burden and likely increases in electric rates

the first state to ban indoor smoking except 
for designated areas is now taking the lead nationally in trying to 
snuff out cigarette machines or at least keep them out of 
youngsters reach 
since the st paul suburb of white bear lake passed the states 
first ban on cigarette vending machines in october at least 20 
other minnesota cities have prohibited or restricted the machines 
the restrictions are part of a grassroots movement for a 
smokefree society said jean forster assistant professor in the 
university of minnesotas school of public health 
its captured the imagination of local communities she 
said its something they can do at their level there are a lot 
of places watching whats happening in minnesota 
a measure pending in congress sponsored by rep thomas luken 
dohio would ban cigarette machines in any location accessible to 
people under 18 
testimony at a hearing last year cited a national automatic 
merchandising association report that only 25 percent of teenage 
smokers buy their cigarettes from machines 
but advocates of cigarette machine bans say any percentage is 
significant 
it may not stop kids from smoking but it puts another 
roadblock in the way said white bear lake mayor jerry briggs 
a few other states and communities outside minnesota have 
instituted or are considering cigarette machine bans but angela 
mickel director of the tobaccofree america legislative 
clearinghouse in washington dc said the local campaigns in 
minnesota are the most widespread shes seen 
minnesota is looked at as a leader in health advocacy she 
said 
in 1975 the state passed the nations first clean indoor air 
act the law restricting indoor smoking was a model for laws across 
the country 
white bear lake and bloomington are among at least eight 
minnesota cities banning cigarette machines altogether 
others have enacted softer restrictions redwood falls bans the 
machines from public places preston restricts them to places 
licensed to sell liquor excelsior requires that machines be under 
constant supervision by employees 
the local measures were almost nullified last month when 
minnesota lawmakers considered a proposal that would have 
overridden local restrictions for the sake of consistent statewide 
regulation 
the bill that passed instead preserves local governments power 
to ban the machines while tightening restrictions statewide 
that measure which awaits gov rudy perpichs signature 
requires electronic locks on machines that a businesss employees 
can activate and requires that the machines be kept where workers 
can monitor their use 
walker merryman vice president of the tobacco institute a 
washington trade association for cigarette manufacturers said the 
tobacco industry has taken no position on the matter its an 
issue that pertains to the vendors he said 
but he added that the bans are no surprise minnesota has a 
certain history of being receptive to any antismoking 
initiative merryman said 
the vending machine industry argued unsuccessfully before state 
lawmakers that minors can be protected without a ban 
were looking for uniformity said tom briant lawyer for 
the minnesota coalition for responsible vending sales we think 
it would be in the public interest to regulate it on a statewide 
basis 
briant said about 275 people could lose their jobs by allowing 
bans throughout the state but antismoking activists say bans are 
the only way to keep minors from buying cigarettes from vending 
machines 
jordan cushing a 16yearold minneapolis sophomore said she 
knows many teenagers whose addiction began by purchasing 
cigarettes from machines 
its really really easy said cushing who has worked with 
antismoking groups if the machines are taken away it would 
make a big difference 
she said any potential loss of jobs is outweighed by health 
concerns their main argument is money but these are lives 
lives that havent really even had the chance to get started she 
said

steeply during the afternoon then narrowed its deficit by about 
350 points with a rally in the last 20 minutes of trading helped 
in part by arbitrage buying traders said 
a nomura securities trader attributed the indexs afternoon fall 
to broad declines in speculative shares that triggered selling of 
other issues and to profittaking from shares that had advanced in 
the past week the trader spoke on condition of anonymity 
prompted by growing concern that some speculators may be in 
financial trouble the nikkei index fell quickly as investors tried 
to get rid of speculative shares including some local bank issues 
he said 
betty wu an analyst with sbci securities asia ltd said the 
afternoons drop resulted in part from index selling as 
individuals were trying to curb their losses 
she predicted relatively quiet trading in the next few weeks 
because corporations have just closed their books on fiscal 1989 
which ended march 31 and are deciding future investment strategies

bank of japan governor yasushi mieno is to leave for the meeting 
in paris on friday 
some investors also sold the dollar for profittaking tabata 
said 
but the yens strength is likely to last only temporarily 
he added 
a dealer with the bank of tokyo who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the us currency rose in new york overnight 
because of speculation the us federal reserve board has halted 
its support for the yen in an attempt to pressure japan to make 
trade concessions in talks with the united states now under way in 
washington 
the rumor has been in the market for some time and it was 
brought up again in new york such speculation has been already

atlantabased contel corp said it planned a 
major restructuring of its telephone operations division that could 
eliminate about 600 jobs across the country 
the cutbacks which represent about 4 percent of contels 
telephone operations staff will take place over the next two 
years they are expected to be achieved largely through attrition 
and voluntary separation programs 
under the restructuring plan contel said it would combine the 
telephone operations from three regions and 12 divisions into six 
multistate operating groups reporting directly to headquarters 
the restructuring centralizes policy setting and allows 
decisions to be made at the local level said brian farley a 
contel spokesman 
although contel has not determined the cost of employee 
separation programs farley said the company does not expect the 
restructuring to have an impact on financial results

general development corp mired in legal and 
financial problems is closing its global network of homesite 
sales offices 
general development announced tuesday it was shutting 24 offices 
in this country as well as bureaus in europe canada and the far 
east and laying off about 1100 workers 
the company is trying to stay out of bankruptcy court and 
recover from a scandal involving a scheme to sell overpriced homes 
thomas d wood a coral gablesbased mortgage banker and 
attorney was named tuesday to examine general developments 
agreement to reimburse nearly 10000 victims of the overpricing 
scheme the agreement was part of a settlement of federal fraud 
charges against the firm 
us district court judge lenore nesbitt said woods role was to 
make the restitution pact acceptable workable and realistic 
general development said the closure of its offices would not 
affect the restitution plan 
the cost of generating sales in these offices no longer makes 
economic sense said company president charles simons also 
given the parameters of the proposed consent decree we are not 
confident that those guidelines are being met on a daily basis in 
many of our offices 
the company will continue to sell existing homes at its nine 
florida communities the focus of the us attorneys office 
twoyear probe into pricing practices 
a federal indictment accused the company and two former 
executives of an elaborate scheme to sell homes with highly 
inflated prices compared with similar florida dwellings the 
victims many from the northeast and midwest were deceived into 
purchasing homes an average of 40 percent higher than market value 
prosecutors said 
a week after the march 16 indictment attorneys for general 
development entered a guilty plea to one fraud count that could 
bring a maximum 500000 fine 
at the same hearing general developments former president 
robert ehrling and former chairman david brown also pleaded guilty 
to one fraud count each faces a maximum of five years in prison a 
250000 fine and some restitution payments sentencing is 
scheduled for may 22 
the plan which still needs final court approval covers general 
development homebuyers from jan 1 1983 to jan 1 1989 and 
establishes a complicated formula to determine how much money will 
be returned 
a courtappointed master will set the restitution amount by 
determining the difference between each homes net price and 
appraised value 
in cases of cash purchases for example the difference would be 
paid in installments over 25 years for those with a mortgage 
through the companys financial division the company would offset 
a portion of the monthly payment 
under the plan general development would pay restitution up to 
25 million a year for the first five years and a smaller portion 
later it would also be required to put up collateral valued at 
125 million by july 1 
discussions of restitution are complicated by cash shortages at 
general development which announced monday that negotiations for 
60 million in shortterm credit fell apart and it might seek 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
assistant us attorney norman moscowitz and company spokesman 
otis wragg iii declined to comment on how a bankruptcy filing would 
affect the restitution program 
meanwhile general development is the target of several 
burgeoning classaction suits stemming from the overpricing scheme 
and conditions in the florida communities in delaware a major 
shareholder has filed suit seeking to oust six company directors

takeover strategist carl icahn says spinning 
off usx corps steel division would increase shareholders returns 
by about 29 percent 
the new york financier told stockholders in a letter tuesday he 
estimated that shares in a separate energy company would be worth 
39 while stock in a steel unit would be worth 9 
usxs stock closed tuesday at 3712 a share up 150 in new 
york stock exchange composite trading 
usx spokesman william keslar declined to comment on the letter 
today saying the company was studying it 
icahn the largest stockholder of usx with 34 million shares or 
1329 percent has asked the shareholders for a nonbinding vote on 
a proposal to spin off the steel division and call the new company 
us steel 
fourfifths of the new company would become a dividend to usx 
shareholders who also would own marathon oil co and smaller usx 
interests 
the rest of the new company would go to new investors icahns 
plan would include no more than 15 billion in longterm debt 
incurred by the steel division 
the stockholders will vote on icahns proposal at usxs annual 
meeting may 7 
usx has opposed the plan executives said it would make marathon 
and us steel more vulnerable to slumps in either the energy or 
steel industries 
usx has said 65 percent of its revenue comes from marathon 
while 31 percent come from steel operations 
icahn who is the chairman of trans world airlines said in the 
letter usx could properly structure the division of its companies 
to make them essentially taxfree to the company and its 
stockholders the plan would preserve net operating losses of usx 
he said 
usx chairman charles a corry recently told wall street analysts 
icahns plan had pitfalls because the company could lose tax 
credits resulting from steel losses in the early 1980s

american airlines inc looking for ways 
to increase traffic and also eliminate free travel owed millions of 
travelers will let frequent fliers turn miles into money rebates 
on purchases from fast cars to fur coats 
the rebates ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars 
depending on the product and miles exchanged will be paid directly 
to customers from the product makers michael w gunn americans 
marketing vice president said tuesday 
the program also will help manufacturers such as automakers 
boost sales 
our customer research shows that while most members will still 
claim travel awards a significant number appreciate the option of 
savings on products and services gunn said at a news conference 
announcing a program called aadvantage extra 
most other major airlines said they were studying americans 
program but delta air lines spokesman neil monroe said the 
atlantabased carrier was pleased with its current frequent flier 
program and planned no changes 
gunn suggested the program would be hard to match because it 
took american 11 months to assemble 
but phillip j lederer a management professor at the university 
of rochester who follows the commercial airline industry said i 
would be surprised if the majors didnt follow 
some analysts have worried that the buildup of free miles could 
haunt the industry by slashing revenue as customers cashed them in 
the internal revenue service and accounting standards groups have 
been considering whether individuals or companies should be taxed 
or held liable for the miles 
randy patterson who publishes a magazine for frequent fliers 
praised americans program as a way to reward customers at the same 
time the company gets rid of the potential free travel 
i dont think they like the idea of having that liability on 
their books said patterson who estimated the company owes 
customers some 70 billion frequent flier miles last year american 
flew 735 billion revenue passenger miles which measures the total 
travel of paying customers 
gunn would not confirm pattersons estimate and refused to 
provide company figures neither would he reveal americans 
estimates of how many unused free miles the aadvantage extra 
program would eliminate 
gunn said american had more than 11 million members in its 
aadvantage program but less than half are active and only 2 
million will receive one of the slick catalogs listing the rebate 
items 
under the aadvantage extra program customers with more than 
20000 miles can trade some miles for cash rebates of up to 1500 
on three 1990 toyota models 1000 on a grid systems computer or 
1600 on a fox fur coat 
the largest awards were a 15000 rebate on an adolfo lynx coat 
from the fur vault in exchange for 120000 miles and with 90000 
miles a 10 percent discount on deck house homes costing more than 
100000 
college savings bank will also allow aadvantage extra users to 
buy certificates of deposit at a lower rate and higher yield than 
the general public quick amp reilly a discount stock broker will 
charge reduced commissions in exchange for aadvantage miles 
aadvantage members earn miles through flying on american 
airlines and some other carriers staying in certain hotels and 
using some rental cars miles also can be accumulated through using 
some charge cards 
generally the miles are then exchanged for free or reduced 
cost travel on american or other travel benefits

the house has approved antitakeover 
legislation considered the toughest in the nation meant to make it 
more difficult for corporate raiders to grab or threaten 
pennsylvania companies 
the 18210 vote tuesday sends the bill back to the senate where 
members must consider amendments added by the house several 
senators and aides predicted the bill backed by gov robert p 
casey would gain easy passage on its second trip through the upper 
chamber 
if enacted corporate takeover strategists would be denied 
shortterm profits from takeover attempts the provision would 
apply when a takeover artist tries to sell holdings within 18 
months of a failed buyout bid 
the bill also would deny raiders immediate voting rights and 
would require management to consider employee and community 
interests along with stockholder concerns in deciding takeover 
offers 
democratic representative fred taylor a supporter of the 
measure said it would protect pennsylvania jobs companies and 
communities 
were sending a message with this bill to corporate raiders 
who have gone into pennsylvania laid waste to companies and forced 
them to buy back their own stock practically bankrupting them 
taylor said 
were telling them pennsylvania is not the playground of wall 
street this doesnt outlaw takeovers all together but it is 
certainly going to make that proposition a lot more difficult to 
participate in he said 
opponents have said the measure would stifle investment in 
pennsylvania the chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission criticized the pennsylvania bill monday saying it would 
disenfranchise shareholders and leave incompetent managers free 
to run a company into the ground 
republican representative robert godshall who oppposed the 
bill said it would take away fundamental and basic rights of 
shareholders i dont think this is good for pennsylvania labor i 
dont think its good for pennsylvania industry and i dont think 
its good for the state of pennsylvania 
the house made some minor changes to the bill but the its 
sponsor republican senator noah wenger said it appeared largely 
intact wenger said he expected the senate to reconsider the bill 
in about two weeks the senate initially passed the bill in 
december 454 
in the long run it will strengthen not only employment 
oportunities but investment opportunites those people who make 
the big bucks in takeovers would naturally be opposed to those 
things wenger said 
the measure stems from an effort to help a prominent 
pennsylvania company armstrong world industries fight off a 
hostile takeover attempt by the belzberg family of canada belzberg 
holds more than 10 percent of the company stock and is seeking to 
put its candidate on the board of directors 
william a k titelman a harrisburg lobbyist who represents the 
belzbergs said the legislation was a form of corporate 
stalinism 
the effect of this bill can be summed up in one sentence 
regardless of competence or performance the top management of a 
publicly owned corporation shall not be changed except with their 
express consent and regardless of the wishes of the owners of the 
corporation he said 
more than half the states have enacted takeover laws but only 
indiana has a section similar to pennsylvanias proposal to 
diminish directors financial responsibility to stockholders 
under the legislation company managers would be able to decide 
to exempt their companies from the proposed law within 90 days of 
its enactment workers laid off 90 days prior to the completion of 
a takeover would be eligible for a lump sum severance of one weeks 
pay for each year of service up to 26 weeks

unsecured creditors of eastern airlines 
frustrated by the companys mounting losses and plans to reduce 
debt payments have agreed to seek the appointment of a special 
trustee to find a buyer for the carrier 
the unsecured creditors committee voted unanimously tuesday to 
reject easterns latest reorganization proposal which would give 
them only 25 cents for each dollar owed a majority of the 
creditors also voted to seek the appointment of a special trustee 
sources close to the committee said 
this group has had it and theyre not going to take it 
anymore one of the sources said 
the move puts the creditors in alliance with easterns unions 
which have sought a trustee since miamibased eastern filed for 
bankruptcy protection on march 9 1989 the chapter 11 filing came 
five days after the start of a crippling strike by pilots flight 
attendants and machinists 
until recently the creditors had been supportive of eastern 
efforts to rebuild the unions meanwhile have argued that a 
trustee should take over the management of eastern from frank 
lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp they accuse 
lorenzo of draining easterns assets into its sister carrier 
continental airlines and texas air 
in a meeting in new york tuesday with officials of eastern and 
texas air the committee of unsecured creditors rejected easterns 
plan to repay 25 percent of the 980 million it owes them the 
sources said 
the creditors committee authorized its attorneys to ask the 
us bankruptcy court to appoint a special trustee to sell the 
airline said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity the 
committee dropped an earlier threat to press for a liquidation of 
eastern 
the unsecured creditors include aircraft manufacturers such as 
boeing co and airbus industrie and jet engine makers like general 
electric co 
the plan presented today serves the creditors far better than 
any alternative transaction including liquidation or sale of the 
airline both of which are exceedingly remote said eastern 
spokesman robin matell in miami 
referring to the creditors move for a trustee he said 
assuming that is not a negotiating ploy there is no legal or 
policy basis for the appointment of a trustee 
separately tuesday us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland 
adjourned until may 9 consideration of the unions request for a 
trustee which previously had been deferred about half a dozen 
times 
the creditors committee could present its trustee demand at 
that time the creditors also may be hardening their stance in an 
effort to extract fuller payment from eastern 
last july eastern promised creditors full repayment of debts 
with interest it slashed that proposal in late january to 10 cents 
on the dollar in cash when the airline emerges from bankruptcy 
protection and another 70 percent over the following 10 years 
without interest 
after the creditors balked eastern reached agreement with them 
in midfebruary on a plan that would pay 50 cents on the dollar 
upon emerging from bankruptcy but eastern told the creditors last 
week it couldnt fulfill that agreement because of problems in 
attracting passengers and rebuilding its operations 
in response the creditors committee privately passed a 
resolution last week authorizing its attorneys to seek the 
appointment of a trustee to replace current management and to 
propose a plan of liquidation 
the creditors attorneys would take such action if texas air 
refused to cover easterns future operating losses according to 
the resolution 
at tuesdays meeting robert ferguson a vice president of texas 
air told the creditors the company would agree to cover only a 
portion of easterns losses the sources said 
the carriers latest plan called for paying 10 cents on the 
dollar in the form of eastern notes guaranteed by continental 
another 10 cents in texas air notes and the remaining 5 cents in 
cash the sources said 
this time the creditors responded by calling for a sale of 
eastern rather than a liquidation earlier speculation about a 
possible liquidation had hurt the airline by scaring away 
passengers and travel agents 
they took out the l word a source said 
the creditors have been soliciting possible buyers behind the 
scenes in recent weeks sources say 
the creditors committee also was concerned that calls for 
liquidation could jeopardize the proposed sale of easterns prized 
latin american routes to rival american airlines for 349 million 
proceeds from that sale are central to easterns plan to rebuild 
the transaction was approved by lifland last thursday but still 
must be approved by the transportation department a decision by 
the department is expected by friday 
a committee of the airlines preferred shareholders also has 
expressed disapproval with easterns reorganization and repayment 
proposals

higher in early trading today on the chicago board of trade 
extending gains posted in the previous session in the wheat and 
corn markets 
some of the buying was seen as a followthrough to tuesdays

early next week in us winter wheat country and to the agriculture 
departments announcement late tuesday that 100000 metric tons of 
us corn were sold for export to unknown destinations which often 
means the soviet union

complex trade negotiations with japan entered 
an unscheduled third day today as us trade ambassador carla hills 
warned that the japanese must make concessions or face growing 
prospects of economic retaliation by the united states 
the negotiations aimed at making broad structural reforms in 
the economies of both the united states and japan began monday 
with the arrival of a 64member delegation from japan 
while both sides are insisting that progress is being made the 
talks had originally been scheduled to conclude on tuesday 
however negotiators met for a third day of closeddoor bargaining 
at the state department talks on both monday and tuesday went late 
into the night 
hills denied that the lengthy negotiations indicated unexpected 
roadblocks had developed 
there is no deadlock we are making progress she told 
reporters following a speech to the national association of 
manufacturing we want to get it done 
hills told officials of the big industry lobbying group that the 
marketopening moves being proposed by the american side were in 
the selfinterest of japanese consumers who currently pay the 
highest prices in the industrial world for many products 
as she has done in the past she said that without trade 
concessions on the part of the japanese to correct the huge 
usjapan trade imbalance there would be growing pressure in this 
country to retaliate by raising the cost of japanese products 
if the japanese do not open up the second largest market in 
the world there will be enormous political pressure she told 
the manufacturing officials 
president bush was scheduled to meet today with former 
ambassador to washington nobuo matsunaga who was dispatched to 
washington as the personal emissary of japanese prime minister 
toshiki who has made resolution of usjapan trade frictions a 
top priority of his government 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said that we seem to 
have made good progress on trade disputes involving 
supercomputers and satellites in the twoandahalf days of talks 
with japan 
we still have differences we still have some difficult issues 
to resolve but at least we feel that a good starts been made 
fitzwater said 
after months of no progress with japan on trade there have been 
three agreements reached in the past 10 days on opening japanese 
markets for sale of americanmade telecommunications products 
supercomputers and satellites the satellite agreement was 
announced late tuesday 
even with the flurry of new agreements american business 
leaders urged caution noting that the japanese over the past 
decade have prepared a variety of trade packages which have not 
produced the promised results americas deficit with japan totaled 
49 billion last year close to half of the total 109 billion 
trade imbalance 
i still think it is up in the air whether the trade talks will 
yield any meaningful results said jerry jasinowski president of 
the national association of manufacturers which was to receive a 
progress report today on trade negotiations from us trade 
representative carla hills 
the bush administration last july launched discussions with 
japan aimed at removing broad structural barriers in both the 
united states and japan that were viewed as primary reasons for the 
trade imbalance 
under the format for the talks known as the structural 
impediments initiative both sides have presented their own list of 
the economic failings they would like to see corrected in the other 
country 
the united states has pushed for changes in japan that would 
expand opportunities for us and other foreign firms to provide 
products and services arguing that such proposals were in the 
selfinterest of the japanese because they would lower consumer 
costs 
japan has targeted various us failings that hurt americas 
ability to compete internationally the japanese would like to see 
more done by us officials to lower the budget deficit improve 
the educational system and get us businesses to focus on 
longterm goals rather than quick profits 
negotiators hope to have an interim progress report completed by 
midapril with a final report on structural barriers finished in 
july

the senate began debate today on president 
bushs choice as chief savings and loan regulator with democrats 
denouncing the nominee as unqualified for the job 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the senate 
banking committee said t timothy ryan jr a 44yearold former 
senior labor department official did not have the relevant 
experience needed to regulate the nations 2500 sampls at this 
crisis point in the industry 
this is an enormous job you want someone of towering 
capacity at a minimum you want somebody who has a 
wellestablished reputation as an expert in finance riegle said 
you cant settle for something less than what you need for 
the task at hand unfortunately that is what you have here 
nevertheless most senators and industry lobbyists predicted 
ryan will be confirmed by a narrow margin to a fiveyear term as 
director of the treasury departments office of thrift supervision 
republicans portrayed ryan as a strong manager and tough 
enforcement official who helped clean up the teamsters union as 
solicitor of the labor department 
management experts often recommend you bring in somebody from 
the outside if there was ever an industry that needs to be shaken 
up it is this one said sen jake garn of utah senior 
republican on the banking panel 
riegle said senators had not yet agreed when to vote on ryan 
but he said he expected two or three hours of debate which would 
put the vote late today 
both sides say ryans admission of past drug use will play 
little role in the senate debate as part of his background 
clearance ryan told the fbi that he had tried marijuana and 
cocaine in the early 1970s while he was in law school 
i just dont think we can hold people responsible for 
something they did in their younger years forever garn said 
i made my judgment based on the lack of qualification said 
riegle 
two democrats richard shelby of alabama and terry sanford of 
north carolina registered support for ryan last week when the 
senate banking committee endorsed the nomination on an 1110 vote 
if the administration can hold all 45 republicans in the 
100member senate it needs to pick up only three more democrats 
vice president dan quayle then could break a 5050 tie for the 
republicans 
such an outcome would not overly upset democrats said kenneth 
guenther executive vice president of the independent bankers 
association of america 
you have someone in office who you can point your finger to 
and say i told you so he said 
the administration is under pressure to appoint a thrift office 
director because of a judges ruling march 21 that officials of the 
agency lack constitutional authority to seize failing sampls an 
appeals courts suspension of the ruling expires april 11 
if ryan is defeated riegle has prepared legislation that would 
remove the basis of the legal challenge and allow acting thrift 
office director salvatore martoche to serve another 90 days 
democratic and republican senators discussed the nomination at 
private luncheons tuesday 
in the democratic caucus there was a lot of loud talk but 
the expectation was ryan will get by on a tight vote said one 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
i think hell be confirmed but i have no idea what the 
numbers will be garn said after the republican meeting 
many savings and loan executives are leery of ryan because at 
his confirmation hearing last week he said he was unsure if the sampl 
industry should survive 
however sampl trade groups say theyve been staying out of the 
battle not wanting to campaign against the man likely to be the 
industrys chief regulator 
charles h keating jr who as owner of lincoln savings and loan 
association is at the center the nations worst thrift failure and 
defendant in a 11 billion fraud suit filed by regulators wrote 
letters to all senators opposing ryan 
i submit this is hardly the time to shrink from the challenge 
of finding competent people to handle the important affairs of our 
government i fear for the future of the republic keating

sales of north americanmade cars and trucks by 
the big three automakers slipped 15 percent in late march compared 
with last year extending the downturn that began six months ago 
the companies said wednesday 
a severe drop in sales of chrysler corp vehicles and a smaller 
decline in ford motor co car sales more than offset a moderate 
sales gain by general motors corp 
the decline during the march 2131 period this year came against 
a relatively soft sales period last year 
altogether gm ford and chrysler which account for about 85 
percent of the domestically made cars sold in the united states 
reported that their cars and light trucks were bought at a combined 
average daily rate of 37623 during the period this year compared 
with a 38193vehicleaday rate last year 
car sales declined 43 percent and truck sales rose 31 percent 
there were no definitive reasons for the overall decline such 
as the presence or absence of incentives which often color 
yeartoyear comparisons the figures indicate that consumers 
either are hanging on to their cars and waiting for incentives 
later in the year or simply that demand is weaker than during the 
latemarch period last year 
through the first three months of this year the big threes car 
and truck sales were down 36 percent compared with the first 
quarter of last year 
normally sales pick up in march and april as consumers think 
more about road trips than they do in the winter months but last 
year and so far this year that trend hasnt held 
for march this year big three car and truck sales were running 
63 percent behind the rate last year 
gm said latemarch car sales were 39 percent ahead of last year 
and truck sales were up 109 percent combining for a 61 percent 
increase in vehicle sales the companys car and truck sales since 
january were down a slim 07 percent 
ford reported its cars and trucks were selling at a pace 38 
percent behind last year during late march with car sales down 81 
percent and truck sales up 29 percent 
for the first three months of the year fords vehicle sales 
were 63 percent behind last years pace 
chryslers vehicle sales were down 166 percent in late march 
with car sales falling 237 percent and truck sales dropping 94 
percent for the first quarter of this year chryslers car and

ivan boesky the disgraced wall street 
speculator who made insider trading a household term in the 1980s 
completed a threeyear prison sentence wednesday when he was 
released from a halfway house 
boesky 53 signed release papers and left the brooklyn house 
community corrections center at 505 am said richard luna a 
us bureau of prisons official in new york 
boesky was transferred to the facility dec 6 from a 
minimumsecurity federal prison in lompoc calif to finish out 
his term he ended up serving just over two years with time off 
for good behavior 
on nov 14 1986 boesky paid 100 million to the securities and 
exchange commission and agreed to plead guilty to one criminal 
count of lying to federal regulators to settle charges of rampant 
insider trading 
the penalty was a record at the time and boeskys confessions 
of a rats nest of illegal stock dealings using confidential 
information stunned wall street during its greatest boom time since 
the 1920s 
prosecutors used information supplied by boesky who cooperated 
in exchange for leniency to bring charges leading to a record 650 
million settlement by drexel burnham lambert inc and an indictment 
against drexel junk bond division chief michael milken 
court documents alleged that drexel which collapsed last month 
and milken had a secret arrangement with boesky that violated 
securities laws in at least 16 transactions from 1984 to late 1986 
boesky began his term at the lompoc federal prison camp in april 
1988 he was granted a monthlong furlough in new york last 
november when he was photographed by a new york tabloid with 
shoulderlength hair and a rip van winkle beard before his 
transfer to the halfway house 
starting feb 5 boesky lived outside the center reported in 
twice a week and called in daily luna said boesky now must to 
report to a probation officer regularly until september said 
eunice jones chief federal probation officer in new york 
boeskys lawyer robert mccaw declined to comment on where 
boesky has been living or what his plans are boesky owns a 75acre 
estate in westchester county north of new york city where he had 
lived with his wife seema 
while living outside the halfway house boesky was required to 
have a paying job although officials declined to say what that 
was halfway house staff members visited boesky once a week at his 
home and job luna said 
under his settlement with the government boesky is barred for 
life from the securities industry but a loophole in federal law 
reportedly could allow him to serve as an investment adviser for up 
to 14 people 
a source close to boesky said he did not believe boesky who 
wrote a 1985 book merger mania was compiling his memoirs the 
source said boesky would not grant any of numerous interview 
requests until he has finished his role as a government witness if 
then 
boesky is expected to testify against milken whose trial may 
not begin until 1991 and at the securities fraud trial of former 
stock speculator john a mulheren scheduled to begin april 30 
mulheren was a former business associate of boeskys who at one 
point was arrested for weapons possession and allegedly told police 
he planned to kill boesky 
the silverhaired boesky also still faces more than two dozen 
shareholder lawsuits and other litigation naming him his defunct 
partnership cx partners lp and affiliated entities such as drexel 
and milken the lawsuits are pending in us district court in 
manhattan before judge milton pollack 
mitchell kaplan a boston attorney for cx partners which was 
boeskys main stocktrading fund said information gathering is 
completed but the government has barred both sides from 
interviewing a list of about 200 witnesses presumably because of 
milkens pending trial 
under the first civil settlement of boeskyrelated cases 
reached in january the 46 investors in boeskys partnership will 
receive 248 million in liquidation proceedings

challenges wednesday to shareholder and creditor approval of 
northeast utilities takeover plan for bankrupt public service 
company of new hampshire 
judge james yacos refused to consider a bid by a lawyer 
representing a group of small power producers to have their votes 
counted as rejecting the plan he said the request came too late 
lawrence katz argued that the small producers claims arent 
adequately recognized in the northeast plan because its rate 
agreement says northeast will try to renegotiate contracts between 
public service and 13 of the small power producers 
but yacos said any future contract negotiations between a 
reorganized public service and the small producers would be a 
twoway affair and that the northeast plan does not deny any 
contracts outright 
this reorganization plan recognizes your claims said yacos 
in accepting the unsecured creditors approval of the plan 
the first half of wednesdays hearing was devoted to officially 
accepting ballot results yacos said he would consider objections 
raised by small power producers and stockholders when actually 
discussing confirmation 
a group of dissident stockholders led by robert richards of 
new york city told the judge that common stockholders arent 
getting enough money back in the deal and that voting by 
rankandfile stockholders was tainted 
but yacos said the 762 million figure was agreed upon after 15 
days of disclosure hearings in november and he found no reason to 
reverse his approval 
public service filed for bankruptcy protection in january 1988 
the largest public utility to do so since the great depression 
much of its financial problems stemmed from expenses associated 
with the seabrook nuclear plant which became a nationwide focal 
point of antinuclear opposition 
the majority of stockholders approved the 23 billion 
reorganization plan calling for seven annual 55 percent 
electricity rate increases

theres a mouse in the kitchen but 
call off the exterminator hes a familiar guy named mickey and 
all he wants is to expand the vast disney empire into restaurants 
walt disney co already has capitalized in the retail industry 
through stores at shopping malls selling clothing and other 
products adorned with its characters 
on april 28 the 50th disney store is to open at the montclair 
plaza mall 35 miles east of los angeles connected to it will be 
mickeys kitchen a prototype that will be duplicated around the 
country if successful 
the disney restaurant will be an exciting new concept 
featuring fast food in a fun setting says a mall sign seeking 
counter help and kitchen workers 
disney hopes store customers wont be able to resist stopping 
off for a quick bite to eat or a drink at the soda fountain next 
door disney stores range from 3000 to 5000 square feet the new 
connected store and restaurant will be about 12000 square feet 
with seating for about 150 at the counter and tables 
the restaurant is the latest experiment in crossmarketing for 
disney said harold vogel a securities analyst who follows disney 
for merrill lynch amp co 
theyre looking at all sorts of concepts vogel said 
wednesday he said the disney stores have been very successful 
because the disney brand name until recently anyway seemed 
underexploited 
chuck champlin a spokesman for disneys consumer products 
division said the restaurant will use disneys familiar characters 
in new ways he wouldnt say exactly how but noted that disney 
stores feature figures of the characters posed so they appear to be 
filming movies 
in a torrance mall for example the display takes the form of 
an outer space adventure with cameraman goofy filming donald duck 
in pursuit of a villain who has kidnapped minnie mouse 
despite the sign posted at the restaurant site and a restaurant 
logo that shows mickey holding a burger and milkshake disney wants 
to avoid the association with highfat highcalorie fare that the 
words fast food often summon 
were very concerned with the disney image that a restaurant 
with the disney name is safe for you so we want it to be healthier 
than in some fastfood places champlin said however he 
declined to reveal the menu saying it still was being finalized 
disney has extensive experience with restaurants in its theme 
parks and hotels champlin said 
no one at the mall thinks the idea is goofy said sonya bennett 
19 the assistant manager of the wild pair shoe store directly 
across from mickeys kitchen 
ive heard people talking about it she said they say 
they can hardly wait for it to open 
parents with small children and teenagers were the most 
inquisitive she said 
it took about six months for the first disney store to prove its 
viability after it opened in the glendale galleria in april 1987 
disney is making no promises regarding the restaurants 
the watchword is very slow development champlin said 
weve got the one restaurant now and we want to study carefully 
before going ahead with any more

italy vowed wednesday to dedicate its upcoming 
presidency of the european community to speeding up monetary 
economic and political union in order to keep up with the pace of 
change in eastern europe 
foreign minister gianni de michelis said integration of the 12 
ec countries needs to be accelerated as a result of the political 
upheavals throughout the soviet bloc and the process of german 
reunification 
he said italy will seek to play a pivotal role in the creation 
of a new europe when it assumes the ecs rotating sixthmonth 
presidency on july 1 
the events of the first months of this year are already 
compelling us to step up our pace in the wake of german 
reunification which is moving ahead of european unification said 
a working paper on italys ec agenda 
the document presented at a news conference by de michelis 
described 1990 as an era comparable only to the aftermath of 
world war ii 
common market leaders are scheduled to open a special conference 
in italy in december to rewrite parts of their founding 1957 treaty 
of rome the revisions will clear the way for economic and monetary 
union including creation of a regional central bank and a common 
currency 
de michelis said the monetary conference will begin dec 14 and 
should be concluded within the first six months of 1991 rather 
than the end of the year as originally envisioned 
he said italy wants a conference on political union to be held 
simultaneously with the monetary talks these negotiations would 
reform ec institutions extend the powers of the european 
parliament and strengthen political cooperation with the aim of 
shaping a common foreign policy 
de michelis said the political treaty could be implemented as 
early as the next european parliament elections in 1994 he gave no 
details of the new political structure which has been variously 
described as the european union or the european federation 
although british prime minister margaret thatcher has opposed 
monetary and political union de michelis said the prevailing 
opinion among ec members favors the unity programs and that on 
the whole the community is moving toward harmony and away from 
dissonance 
with the ec scheduled to become a single market by the end of 
1992 italy will seek to push through approval this year of most of 
the remaining provisions necessary to meet the deadline de 
michelis said the 12 nations have already approved 60 percent of 
the 279 directives but the italian working paper said a strong 
political will and a further stepping up of our pace is necessary

sales of north americanmade cars and trucks rose 
29 percent in late march compared with last year the automakers 
reported wednesday but the increase stemmed largely from gains by 
general motors corp 
auto industry analysts said the results were encouraging 
nonetheless they said it was unclear whether the 6monthlong slump 
was coming to an end 
vehicle sales by ford motor co and chrysler corp fell by 38 
percent and 166 percent respectively during the march 2131 period 
this year compared with last year 
gms latemarch car and truck sales rose 61 percent mostly 
because of its light trucks including minivans that were offered 
with buyerluring incentives for the first time 
on march 22 gm began offering 1000 rebates and on its 
threevehicle line of minivans the chevrolet lumina apv the 
pontiac trans sport and the oldsmobile silhouette the program runs 
until may 2 
combined car and truck sales for the nine major us automakers 
rose to a daily average of 43688 during the period this year 
compared with an average of 42451 during the same time last year 
car sales were up 27 percent and lighttruck sales rose 32 
percent during the period compared with a relatively soft period in 
1989 
however for all of march and for the first three months of this 
year with imported vehicles included sales lagged behind the 
corresponding periods in 1989 
combined domestic and imported car and truck sales of 1271465 
vehicles last month was 31 percent lower than the march sales 
figures last year for the first quarter of 1990 sales were 18 
percent behind last years pace 
for the first three months of the year fords car and truck 
sales were down 63 percent and chryslers were off 56 percent 
gms 3 percent decline in car sales was offset by a 4 percent jump 
in truck sales during the quarter 
during the threemonth period compact van sales increased 
41 percent over the same quarter last year due in large part to 
gms newly introduced apvs said ji stark executive director 
for gms worldwide vehicle operations 
the real story here as we end the first quarter is that a 
new trend has developed and gm is a marketshare gainer said 
auto analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co of new york 
chrysler with its dodge caravan plymouth voyager and chrysler 
town amp country has held a commanding lead in minivan sales since 
the vehicles were introduced in the mid1980s 
chrysler minivans sales are up 15 percent for the calendar 
year although there has been some dropoff following a record 
january chrysler said in a statement wednesday 
in january chryslers minivan sales received a huge boost 
through a 1000 incentive that program expired at the end of 
january and minivan sales since then have dropped 
nonetheless chryslers trucks with minivans included 
continued in late march to outsell the companys cars for the 
first three months of the year in fact chrysler sold 234665 
north americanmade trucks compared with 194879 cars 
in 1990 we see once again that chrysler is a super truck 
company merlis said i think the best is yet to come in the 
car area in some respects this is a transition year 
chrysler plans to introduce cars built from a new basic design 
in late 1992 
merlis said the slump in the auto industry that began in 
october as the 1990 model year got under way appears to have 
bottomed out 
sales have found a resting point he said theyve 
stabilized at this plateau its not a robust rate but it could be 
worse the strong income growth in job creation and a stable prime 
interest rate has created a nice underpinning for sales

pepsicola co is giving the phrase pop art a 
new slant with four jazzy new labels for cans of its flagship soft 
drink brand as part of a promotion to kick off the summer 
the nations secondlargest soft drink company is calling its 
special package designs cool cans the new packages are showing 
up in stores in the northwest and will be available nationally by 
early may the somers nybased company said 
one of the new designs features a drawing of a surfer in in an 
array of red yellow and blue colors along with the regular pepsi 
label 
in another a drawing of a womans face appears on the label 
with the pepsi logo reflected in her sunglasses 
a third design called neon uses a black rather than a white 
background while a fourth called party incorporates red white 
and blue streamers dots stars and diamonds into the label 
pepsi officials said 12 billion cool cans will be 
distributed during the promotion they will account for more than 
half of the pepsi cans on store shelves for the six to eightweek 
period which ends in june 
some package design analysts warn that it is a mistake to tamper 
with a longestablished label because loyal customers might 
mistakenly feel that signals a change in the product itself 
but michael simpson executive vice president for marketing and 
national sales at pepsicola said pepsi tried to avoid that 
problem by incorporating some element of the original trademark 
into the new designs 
he said in consumer tests of the new labels people clearly 
understood it was pepsi there is no missing the pepsi logo even 
the colors are consistent 
he said the new designs appeal to consumers of all ages 
its a very exciting contemporary look simpson said 
its fun interesting and consistent with the pepsi heritage and 
image 
the introduction of the design labels will be staggered every 
two weeks starting in midmay the company said 
in addition to the new labels the company is creating a 
promotion in which customers who find special markings at the 
bottom of the inside of their pepsi cans will qualify for 4 
million in prizes ranging from 25 to 20000 
the promotion will be backed by a commercial expected to be on 
network television by the end of april or early may featuring the 
grammy awardwinning rap artist young mc 
last month the nations biggest soft drink company cocacola 
co announced its own magic summer promotion 
cocacola is distributing 750000 cans of what appear to be 
regular cans of its flagship cocacola classic but actually 
contain prizes 
each specially designed can contains a mechanism that will 
spring up when the top is pulled and deliver up to 200 in cash or 
a certificate for other prizes 
the cans are designed so that the spring mechanism and the prize 
stay dry because they are separated by a barrier from liquid in the 
can bottom

higher coffee futures surged petroleum futures sank grains and 
soybean advanced andlivestock and meat futures were mixed 
copper futures settled 295 cents to 47 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in april at 1235 a pound 
the end of the peruvian strike was kind of a surprise said 
metals analyst stephen w platt of dean witter reynolds inc some 
observers had not expected the company to negotiate with the 
striking miners until after sundays presidential election 
platt said further selling was linked to the possibility of an 
economic slowdown in japan a fear fueled by the recent decline in 
the japanese stock market 
because copper is used heavily in construction and 
manufacturing a japanese slowdown could pull back on demand from 
one sector that has been quite strong platt said 
silver futures rallied strongly on the commodity exchange 
leading gold higher amid talk that japanese financial institutions 
were moving assets out of the stock market and into silver in a 
flight to quality 
silver futures settled 152 cents to 168 cents higher with 
april at 516 a troy ounce gold was 180 to 190 higher with 
april at 37710 a troy ounce 
coffee futures prices jumped on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange on talk that brazil is preparing to set a minimum coffee 
export price of 80 cents a pound further buying was prompted by 
strong roaster demand 
coffee settled 217 cents to 3 cents higher with may at 9499 
cents a pound 
petroleum futures sagged on the new york mercantile exchange 
amid selling that largely reflected tuesdays weekly american

lower with may at 1978 a barrel heating oil was 121 cents to 
15 cents lower with may at 5402 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 40 cent to 102 cents lower with may at 6486 cents a gallon 
wheat and soybean futures rose strongly on the chicago board of 
trade boosted by fears of a freeze this weekend in winter wheat 
country and by stronger overseas demand for soybean meal corn and 
oat futures also advanced 
wheat for may delivery rose sharply amid signs of tight 
available supplies for delivery against the may contract 
after the close agriculture department announced that 121000 
metric tons of us corn had been sold for export to unknown 
destinations which often means the soviet union 
wheat futures settled 2 cents to 8 cents higher with may at

ford motor co is paying 6 million to settle a 
suit that stemmed from the automakers failure to offer rear 
shoulder harness restraints for the trafficaccident death of a 
child and crippling injuries to his twin 
the settlement announced wednesday is the largest paid in a case 
involving the lack of rear shoulder harnesses said san diego 
attorney craig mcclellan he negotiated the settlement on behalf of 
the twins parents jim and patricia miller who also survived the 
nov 13 1988 accident 
this landmark settlement clearly demonstrates that 
manufacturers will be responsible for failing to install the 
shoulder restraints in pre1990 models said mcclellan dozens of 
similar suits filed throughout the nation are pending against ford 
and other automakers 
under federal regulations combination lap and shoulder safety 
harnesses in the rear are mandatory for all passenger cars as of 
this model year in 1992 the requirement will be expanded to 
include minivans 
ford admitted no liability in the settlement negotiated over 
the past two weeks before a superior court judge approved it 
the millers car a 1986 ford escort was equipped with lap 
belts only in the rear which both boys were wearing on the day of 
the accident 
reliable government studies show that lap belts in rear 
seating positions which have been installed on 140 million cars 
both ford and nonfords are effective in reducing the risk of 
death and serious injury in a collision ford spokesman mark 
miller said from detroit he is not related to the victims family 
certainly this is a tragic situation and ford sympathizes with 
the miller family at the same time ford was not responsible for 
the accident i think experts would agree it would be very 
unfortunate if people stopped using rear lap belts because they can 
enhance safety and reduce the risk of injury and fatality mark 
miller added 
the suit stemmed from a head oncollision on a notorious s 
curve on rancho santa fe road in carlsbad about 40 miles north of 
san diego in which a another car crossed into the wrong lane and 
crashed into the millers car the other driver also died 
on tuesday night the carlsbad city council approved a 550000 
payment to the millers to settle their claims the city also has 
realigned the curve to make the roadway safer 
the front end of the escort was nearly demolished in the 
accident but james and patricia miller survived with broken bones 
and bruises they were strapped in their front seats with shoulder 
harnesses 
mcclellan said the escorts rear compartment was left virtually 
intact but 11yearold james miller died in the crash and his twin 
brother richard suffered a fractured spine when he was pitched 
forward violently both of the boys were wearing their lap belts 
there is no question mcclellan said that james miller would 
have survived and richard miller would not have become a paraplegic 
if they had been wearing shoulder harnesses 
jim miller said had he been given an option he would have paid 
to have rear shoulder harnesses in his escort 
our experience clearly shows that anyone riding or driving in 
a car without rear shoulder harnesses should be concerned about the 
risk they are taking every time they go for a drive even buckled 
up jim miller said 
mcclellan estimated the additional cost at 12 per belt he also 
noted that ford has been installing rear shoulder restraints in 
escorts sold in europe since the early 1980s 
ford never offered the us market the rearset shoulder 
harness mandated by law in european escorts because of the expense 
12 per belt mcclellan said the miller family tragedy is a 
result of that conduct 
the attorney said fords own engineers told management years ago 
that a shoulder restraint system was more effective than lap belts 
in reducing the risk of injury or death in a collision and that any 
argument against their installation was outweighed by increased 
safety benefits

federated and allied department stores on 
wednesday projected no sales growth for the quarter beginning in

protection 
we clearly are doing better in chapter 11 than we expected 
james m zimmerman president of federated department stores inc 
and allied stores corp told the first meeting of the retailers 
unsecured creditors 
zimmerman and other executives said federated and allied dont 
know when they will complete a plan to repay creditors 
the two companies sought us bankruptcy court protection jan

campeau corp in the 1980s it was the largest bankruptcy filing in 
retailing history

bloomingdales chain the companies have no plans to sell 
subsidiaries to pay their debts

million for february

to have itself added to the chapter 11 filing 
the companies expect sales for the quarter ending in april to 
decline 3 percent compared with the previous year said karen m 
hugolet vice president for planning she said that in may june 
and july sales growth should be essentially flat reflecting 
recovery in bankruptcy 
allen i questrom chairman and chief executive officer of 
federated and allied said at the creditors meeting that 98 
percent of merchandise suppliers have resumed shipments to stores 
he said that with a courtapproved employee retention plan 
employee turnover is only slightly higher than last years 
in almost all areas of our operation we have restored 
normalcy he said 
zimmerman said streamlining measures since jan 15 have saved 
the companies 50 million he said their expenses were 5 million 
less than projected in february 
federated executives expect to decide within 30 days whether to 
take bloomingdales off the market 
lawyers for retired federated and allied executives who lost 
supplemental pension benefits when the companies sought chapter 11 
protection repeatedly asked the panel of executives when they would 
consider restoring payments the bankruptcy court stopped the extra 
benefits that were part of the executives contracts 
these are not issues we take lightly and im sure we would be 
moved by individual accounts of the retirees zimmerman said 
but our information tells us right now that such action would be 
counterproductive 
lewis rosenbloom a lawyer for the committee representing 
federated and allied merchandise suppliers said the retailers last 
week produced a list of suppliers left holding checks when the 
bankruptcy court froze federated and allied bank accounts 
rosenbloom said the suppliers have begun to research possible 
ways of seeking repayment before federated and allied issue their 
reorganization plan

house majority leader richard a gephardt 
joined new jerseys congressional delegation wednesday in seeking 
to protect a new jersey camera manufacturer from crippling foreign 
competition 
the lawmakers endorsed higher import quotas and tariffs saying 
500 manufacturing and distribution jobs at keystone camera corp in 
clifton nj were at stake 
the jobs are in the cliftonpaterson nj area which the 
congressmen called one of the most economically depressed zones 
in america 
keystone which describes itself as the sole remaining american 
manufacturer of conventional 35millimeter and 110 cameras filed a 
petition for trade relief march 29 with the international trade 
commission 
keystone requested tariff increases and quotas for five years on 
lowcost imported cameras 
the staggering increase in imports and product inventory which 
keystone revealed in its petition together with the resultant 
depressions of prices production profits and employment poses a 
compelling case for expedited relief the 13 house members and 
democratic sen frank lautenberg wrote in a letter to us trade 
representative carla hills 
sen bill bradley dnj a strong proponent of free trade did 
not sign the group letter instead he will send a separate letter 
urging mrs hills to give the case fair consideration 
spokesman michael jones said 
he didnt sign the new jersey letter because he believes the 
trade commission should arrive at its decision first and then hell 
take a look at that to see whether he agrees with what its 
conclusions were jones said 
this action was taken by us in response to a veritable flood 
of imports which began in 1987 and which drove prices to 
unreasonably low levels causing a succession of deep operating 
losses said myron j berman chief executive officer and board 
chairman of keystone 
the international trade commission must make a determination in 
the case by late july a recommendation to the president by late 
september and can provide relief within eight months the company 
said 
imports of 110 cameras under 20 35mm fixedfocus cameras with 
builtin flash and 35mm autofocus cameras retailing under 50 rose 
from 11 million in 1985 to 275 million in 1987 keystone said 
we earnestly believe that what has happened to keystone could 
happen to virtually any efficiently run us manufacturing

us and japanese negotiators insisting that 
they were making progress struggled wednesday to resolve final 
differences on an unprecedented agreement attacking the huge trade 
imbalance between the two nations 
the discussions which originally had been scheduled to end 
tuesday were taking much longer than planned 
us officials said the two sides would meet again thursday in 
the hope of wrapping up the talks which are aimed at altering 
fundamental economic and business practices in both countries to 
help reduce americas huge 49 billion trade deficit with japan 
us trade representative carla hills denied that the extra 
negotiating sessions indicated the talks had run into unexpected 
roadblocks 
there is no deadlock we are making progress she told 
reporters 
but in a speech wednesday to a us manufacturing group hills 
sounded a warning on the possible consequences if japan fails to 
agree to american demands to open its markets to more foreign goods 
there never has been a nation that benefited so greatly as the 
japanese from the freedom to sell and invest in foreign markets 
she said if the japanese do not open their second largest market 
in the world there will be enormous political pressure to restrict 
those opportunities that have given them so much it will kill the 
goose that laid their golden egg 
to emphasize the importance of the talks president bush met 
wednesday with nobuo matsunaga a former ambassador to the united 
states and deputy foreign minister hisashi owada personal 
emissaries from japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
after the meeting matsunaga told reporters he had stressed to 
bush that kaifu was making a maximum effort to ease trade frictions 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush was given a 
personal letter from kaifu which detailed the efforts the japanese 
government has made in the past month since bush and kaifu held a 
twoday summit conference to review trade problems 
in recent days the japanese have offered marketopening moves 
in the area of americanmade telecommunications products 
satellites and supercomputers 
fitzwater said that bush told the envoys that kaifu deserves a 
very large share of the credit for settling the specific trade 
issues 
both sides have a lot riding on the outcome of the current 
negotiations the japanese are anxious to stem a rising tide of 
antijapanese sentiment in their largest overseas market while the 
bush administration is seeking ways to reduce americas 49 billion 
trade deficit with japan nearly half of last years total deficit 
the latest round of negotiations began monday and had been 
scheduled to go only two days however it was extended because 
both sides found it impossible to cover all the issues even though 
the talks were lasting into the early morning hours 
the talks are unprecedented in their scope because they aim not 
at boosting sales of specific products but at correcting broad 
barriers to trade in both countries 
the effort has prompted japanese critics to charge that the 
united states was trying to remake their nation and scrap centuries 
of tradition in the process 
however the bush administration which began the discussions 
last july has maintained that its proposals would not only reduce 
the us trade deficit by expanding opportunities for american 
sales in japan but also lower prices paid by japanese consumers 
currently the highest in the industrial world 
negotiators this week were preparing an interim progress report 
outlining reforms each side is willing to make with a final report 
scheduled for early july 
among the changes expected to be offered on the japanese side 
were proposals to increase enforcement of antitrust laws to 
discourage bidrigging and other practices by japanese companies 
that us firms have claimed have kept them from cracking the 
japanese market 
the japanese were also expected to offer to boost spending for 
public works projects and to relax restrictions on the 
establishment of large retail stores 
us companies believe that allowing large stores in major 
japanese cities would expand opportunities for american retailers 
and for foreignmade products which are not readily available in 
the smaller stores that predominate in japan 
on the us side the japanese recently presented a list of 80 
proposals designed to boost americas ability to compete 
internationally the administration is not likely to agree to the 
most politically explosive ideas such as restricting americans use 
of credit cards boosting the gasoline tax and eliminating tax 
deductions for home mortgage payments 
however the bush administration was expected to point to 
efforts the president is making to provide expanded tax credits for 
personal savings improve the us education system and balance the 
federal budget

paul newman was alternately portrayed 
as an egotistical movie star who reneged on a promise and a modest 
philanthropist before the salad dressing suit brought by a 
delicatessen owner went to a jury wednesday 
there are people in the world who operate on a different 
level richard albrecht attorney for deli owner julius gold 
told jurors in his closing arguments some do so with grace and 
some do so with raw exhibition of power 
its the race car thing albrecht added referring to 
newmans love of racecar driving as the actor sat smirking in the 
back of the courtroom 
gold is seeking an 8 percent stake in newmans own inc and 
salad king inc claiming he spent four years advising newman and 
helping him establish the food businesses 
newmans lawyer portrayed the actor as an honest businessman who 
started the two companies as a way to raise money for charity he 
played down the portrayal of newman as a rich celebrity by 
referring to golds success as a businessman 
gold is not some poor little shopkeeper attorney w patrick 
ryan said its not david and goliath get that out of your 
head 
the sixmember jury began deliberations at midafternoon and 
were dismissed for the day about an hour and 45 minutes later 
gold said he was confident he would prevail 
i would think the longer the jury stays out in this case the 
better it would look for me gold said 
gold is suing newman writer ae hotchner and the two food 
businesses claiming they reneged on a promise to give him stock in 
return for his participation in the development and marketing of 
newmans own salad dressing 
an earlier trial ended in a mistrial in 1988 when the jury 
mistakenly received depositions that had not been admitted as 
evidence 
superior court judge george n thim told jurors they must 
conclude that gold had an oral contract with newman and the other 
defendants if they are to find in favor of gold 
newman who has been in court almost every day since the trial 
began march 20 contends that golds only participation was to sell 
some of the dressing in his westport store 
newman and hotchner started newmans own on a whim beginning 
with salad dressing that newman originally made in the basement of 
his westport home and later expanding into spaghetti sauce popcorn 
and lemonade 
all profits 28 million to date go to charity the companies 
had a record 42 million in sales last year up from 36 million in 
1988

occidental petroleum corp is justified 
in funding a museum to house the art collection of chairman armand 
hammer because it enhances occidentals image a lawyer for a 
shareholder group said wednesday 
the oil and chemical business is risky attorney william 
prickett said at a hearing before maurice hartnett vice chancellor 
of the delaware chancery court 
prickett cited the love canal toxic waste incident and an 
explosion that killed 167 workers on a north sea oil platform as 
examples of tragedies that have hurt occidentals reputation given 
those risks building a museum to house a prominent collection is a 
legitimate public relations expense for the company he maintained 
this is a unique chance for occidental to be favorably 
identified in the public eye he said 
prickett was defending a settlement the shareholder group has 
reached with occidental that allows the company to continue to fund 
the museum within certain limits 
the court proceeding was called to hear a challenge to the 
settlement by other shareholders who have filed two separate 
classaction lawsuits seeking to stop the company from spending 
money on the museum attorneys for these shareholders contended the 
museums main purpose is to enhance the reputation of occidentals 
91yearold chief 
the museum is a gift to armand hammer that raised more 
controversy and ill will than good will said californias deputy 
attorney general susan henrichsen representing the california 
public employees retirement system 
calpers the nations largest pension fund owns 06 percent of 
occidentals stock 
occidental has said it will cost about 95 million to build the 
museum and establish an endowment to sustain it construction 
already has begun on a site next to the companys headquarters in 
the westwood district of los angeles 
hartnett listened to both sides but did not rule and gave no 
indication when he would do so occidental is based in los angeles 
but incorporated in delaware 
pricketts shareholder group originally filed a lawsuit 
challenging the museum the group dropped its suit after reaching a 
settlement with the oil company that would limit its spending on 
the project and require occidentals name to appear on the museum 
as well as hammers the settlement also included a fee of 14 
million for prickett 
hartnett earlier called the proposed 14 million payment 
huge and prickett said he would not dispute the matter if the 
judge lowered the award 
the occidental chairman announced plans to build the armand 
hammer museum of art and cultural center after reneging on a 
promise to give his 400 million collection to the los angeles 
county museum of art he and the county museum had been embroiled 
in a dispute about how the art would be displayed 
prickett contended that a special committee of occidentals 
independent directors was justified in approving corporate funding 
for the museum he noted that delaware courts have been hesitant to 
intervene in cases involving business judgments made after 
reasonable consideration such as the timewarner merger 
grover brown a lawyer for the special committee defended the 
panels support for the project and said committee members had a 
combined 80 years experience in deciding what was best for 
occidental 
the egocentrism of dr hammer is not a matter for the court 
brown said

restructuring the company said 
until then the banks bondholders and american financial 
would defer all principal and interest payments on their 
respective obligations and waive any existing defaults under their 
current loan agreements circle k said

buy back at least 90 percent of its 510 million in subordinated 
debt circle k said terms of a buyback havent been determined 
yet it said 
the company said the standstill agreement is subject to approval

investor marvin davis has no intention of 
making a new bid for ual corp despite the companys invitation to 
do so sources close to the negotiations said wednesday 
the beverly hills billionaire bid 275 a share for the parent of 
united airlines last august about 62 billion he was topped by a 
300ashare offer for the chicagobased company by team that 
included ual management pilots and british airways 
that deal fell through last october for lack of financing 
however causing uals share price to plummet 
uniteds pilots mechanics and flight attendants unions recently 
have made a new bid estimated to be worth about 185 a share in 
cash debt and stock 
union spokesmen said they never believed davis would make a new 
offer even though ual last month called off a standstill agreement 
with davis freeing him to bid again for the company 
the ual move was seen as an attempt to avert a proxy war by the 
companys largest shareholder coniston partners coniston which 
owns 118 percent of uals shares supported the unions bid and 
said it would wage a proxy battle to take over the board of 
directors if the offer was not accepted 
crains chicago business reported this week that davis had 
suggested a concept to the ual board for a bid of about 220 a 
share the range the board has indicated would be acceptable 
but two sources with knowledge of the situation who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said wednesday that davis would not renew 
his bid for ual 
one source said the unions had made clear they would strike if 
davis or another investor challenged their bid 
no bank will lend into the face of a strike he said 
youve got the union trying to blackmail the board and they have 
the ability to keep anybody else from playing 
he added that the unions will have problems arranging financing 
themselves even at the lower bid level since no one outside has 
offered to help them 
theres no equity partner there so the banks arent willing 
to finance the deal he said
