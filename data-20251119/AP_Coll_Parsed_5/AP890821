when the world ends next week the few who 
are chosen will be able to park their cars in heaven says the man 
who also was predicting apocalypse about this time last year 
well be able to land our airplanes to drive our cars and park 
them said edgar whisenant the selfproclaimed prophet and 
then go on up into the clouds of the earth to the judgment seat of 
christ 
whisenant who predicted last year that the rapture would come 
sept 12 1988 has set a new date 
the end of the world is sept 1 give or take a day whisenant 
said 
he has mailed his paperback book the final shout rapture 
report 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 to preachers across the 
country 
but like the boy who cried wolf whisenant is having trouble 
finding believers this year the news and observer of raleigh 
reported sunday 
he blew his credibility last year said joanna hicks 
coowner of three sign of the fish bookstores in raleigh and nearby 
cary who sold more than a thousand of whisenants books last summer 
nobody thats naming the time and the date gets another chance 
if hes wrong mrs hicks said adding that there has been no 
interest in the new book 
the rapture in some christian theologies refers to the second 
coming of jesus when true believers will be taken to heaven and 
disbelievers will be judged many mainline christians believe jesus 
will return to earth but most are suspicious of prophets who try to 
name the date 
last summer christian radio station wpjlam in raleigh broadcast 
advertisements about the rapture paid for by local believers 
program director jim stephens said he sensed no interest in the 
rescheduled rapture 
people maybe felt like they were burned when the world did 
not end last year he said 
whisenant brushes aside such comments 
you cant have a scoffer until you have a true message being 
given said whisenant 56 and the scoffers are coming out of 
the woodwork this year 
whisenant acknowledged that he has been diagnosed as a paranoid 
schizophrenic but he said the illness had been controlled by 
medicine and has no influence on his predictions which are based on 
the bible he said 
a retired nasa engineer who lives in little rock ark whisenant 
said his calculations were off last year because he miscounted the 
number of years in the first century 
he is 96 percent certain the rapture will come in 1989 he said 
if it doesnt he places a 1 percent chance on each year from 1990 
to 1993 
no way is it going past 93 he said

killing endangered animals can mean prison but 
landowners may with impunity pluck or bulldoze the last specimen of 
the rarest plant on earth 
federal and state agencies keep lists of hundreds of endangered 
plants some discovered so recently they havent been given latin 
names yet laws that prohibit even molesting endangered animals 
regulate only those plants on public land and the theft or sale of 
rare flora 
we are pointing our fingers at the developing nations of the 
world saying how can you destroy your rain forests yet here we 
are allowing our own plant species to become extinct says jora 
young director of stewardship for the nature conservancy in florida 
the lack of concern for plants is ironic ecologists say since 
plants have been more useful than have animals besides providing 
most of the food we eat they produce morphine aspirin digitalis 
atropine alcohol mustard menthol quinine curare germicides 
pesticides and scores of other useful substances 
a lot of plants may not be important now but they may some day 
save lives says richard wunderlin president of the florida 
native plant society 
florida ranks third in the nation for the number of endangered 
plants behind california and texas wunderlin said it also boasts 
at least for now many rare species found nowhere else in the 
country or even the world 
in florida the problem is acute booming development is wiping 
out native plant habitats from the hardwood hammocks in the tropical 
keys to scrub land in central florida and pine woods along the 
apalachicola river 
the state has created an endangered plant advisory council but 
its powers are limited to placing species on a list that merely 
regulates their sale 
were adding more plants to the list all the time says 
council chairman dan austin a botany professor at florida atlantic 
university in boca raton but it doesnt protect the plants 
people can do just about anything they want and nobody outside can 
stop them 
many environmentalists have given up on crowded southeastern 
florida austin said only 1 percent of the native scrub land in palm 
beach county still survives in broward county it has all but 
disappeared the main battleground is now central florida where 
rare plant species are succumbing not only to development but to the 
spread of the citrus industry 
wunderlin points in frustration to a newly discovered species of 
the rattlebox plant that is so new it doesnt even have a scientific 
name it is known only in two locations both housing developments 
near avon park 
the species is disappearing lot by lot we will propose it be 
put on the federal protective list but its still on private 
property so that wont protect it at all each time we go into the 
fields more have disappeared 
the federal government lists only 27 plants for protection 
plants on the list cant be destroyed if they are found on a 
federally funded project such as a dam or public housing but that 
represents a tiny fraction of the development in most areas austin 
said the state does not have any similar prohibitions for the 139 
endangered and 280 threatened plants on its list 
placing a plant on the list isnt always easy because development 
and farm interests routinely oppose such efforts austin said it 
also gives landowners who find endangered plants on property they 
intend to develop an incentive to destroy them quickly to avoid 
later headaches thats perfectly legal 
if youre a developer and you own the last population of the 
big pine partridge pea you can bulldoze it said ms young as 
long as you dont steal if from a federal preserve or try to sell 
it youre ok 
plants have historically gotten short shrift under old english 
law animals which moved through the property of many people 
belonged to the crown making them in effect a public trust but 
plants remained on one spot and were totally the property of the 
landowner 
and people being animals themselves are subject to what ms 
young called the bambi syndrome 
if i talk about the impending extinction of the key deer 
people say oh thats terrible what can we do she said but 
if i say this little mint that occurs only in two places on the 
lake wales ridge is very close to extinction they just shrug and 
say thats too bad 
that prejudice she said is not based on reality besides their 
value to humans lower plants are often food for higher animals and 
their destruction can have unknown implications on the environment 
although state officials and environmentalists see little hope 
for a sudden broad shift in the legal and political climate there 
are some hopeful signs 
dade county has begun to protect some native trees although 
without protecting the habitat they need to survive said julia 
morton a university of miami biologist its only quantitative 
dealing with numbers 
another alternative ms morton found hopeful is transplanting 
rare species to exotic plant nurseries if the developing landowner 
agrees 
that approach while often the only realistic one is inadequate 
wunderlin said in the wild they are very variable genetically by 
removing only a few plants and cultivating them you are preserving 
only a very small proportion 
if they are reintroduced they cant resist extreme conditions he 
added 
environentalists and experts unanimously praised the nature 
conservancy which has bought 400000 acres of environmentally 
sensitive land around florida over the last 25 years it often acts 
as an agent for the state quickly buying the land and then holding 
it until the state bureaucracy is ready to buy it 
the conservancy recently bought a site along the apalachicola 
river that is the last refuge of an endangered evergreen tree it 
has preserved ancient dunes in the lake wales ridge area that are 
the only known home of endangered species such as the scrub plum and 
the pygmy fringe tree and it is buying hammock areas on key largo 
that harbor a variety of tree and plant species 
despite an increase in environmental consciousness austin said 
protecting animals while ignoring plants is like a watchmaker 
taking a watch apart and throwing half the pieces away then trying 
to put it back together 
each day environmentalists say more pieces of the watch are 
disappearing

beijing the hundreds of chinese who line up daily for visas to 
the united states are being questioned more closely by american 
officials since the government crushed the student democracy 
movement in tianamen square in june 
the americans concern is that those who get visas students in 
particular because they are young and usually single wont come 
back to china once the visas expire 
i challenge anyone to think that 1 percent of those applying 
for visas now wants to come back said embassy spokesman sheridan 
bell 
not only do chinese face closer police scrutiny when applying for 
passports and exit permits from their own government they also must 
convince us visa officers that they will return home 
zhang 23 with blue jeans and a fondness for american slang 
waited in line outside the embassy one recent morning with his 
letter of acceptance from a school in arkansas 
no sweat he said confident of his chances 
he came out two hours later 
no way he said glumly explaining he was turned down because 
he couldnt persuade a us official he would come home 
another student huang a government employee in his 30s was 
accepted into a west virginia colleges computer program 
why wouldnt i come back he said before seeing a consular 
official explaining why he should get a visa i have a beautiful 
baby and a wife and a relatively decent job 
like zhang he was on his second try in a month and like zhang 
he was rejected again 
i heard the record is 15 times huang said 
since junes crackdown the canadian embassy has issued student 
visas more freely than before as a humanitarian gesture it said 
the visa process also has been shortened by weeks 
but a us embassy source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said it is much harder now for students not sponsored by the chinese 
government to get american visas those whose tuition is 
governmentpaid have the highest return rate because their families 
are forced to pay if they fail to come home they make up most of 
the estimated 40000 chinese now studying in the united states 
spokesman bell said the consular section gave visas to 744 
privately funded students in june when the embassy was closed for 
two weeks and july he refused to say how many were rejected but 
said about 165 such students apply each day 
even allowing for days with low turnouts that would mean five of 
every six applicants have been turned away 
the application process is arduous it now takes about six weeks 
to get a passport and exit permit from the chinese governnment 
compared to about four weeks before the crackdown as police weed 
out those they regard as counterrevolutionaries 
applicants must bring letters from their chinese schools or 
employers certifying they did not take part in the student protests 
but getting a passport said one thin youth was easy compared 
with getting a us visa 
applicants sometimes wait outside for days to get a ticket for an 
interview they line up at 830 am on their appointed day to wait 
for their numbers to be called 
so intense is their desire to get to the united states that many 
applicants spend extra days outside the embassy huddled with other 
applicants endlessly exchanging tips 
i heard that students with full scholarships have a 90 percent 
chance of getting visas those with partial scholarships have a 50 
percent chance and those relying entirely on sponsors to pay have 
almost no chance said a man who was trying for the second time 
a dozen students listened intently 
nursing and teaching majors are no good he said 
authoritatively the united states is short of nurses and teachers 
and theyll think you want to stay it helps if you come from a 
name school or are going to a name school in the united states like 
yale 
the only topic of conversation is how to please the consuls whom 
everyone knows by room number if not name 
no 1 is a woman shes the easiest said the skinny youth 
no 2 we call lefthand because he writes with his left hand hes 
the toughest nos 3 and 4 are about average 
some say friday seems to be the easiest day to get a visa others 
recommend trying for an early morning interview before the consuls 
get tired and hungry a rich sponsor can help but not too rich 
advised one experienced applicant because the consul might think 
youll be tempted to stay 
many chinese expressed bewilderment that the us congress is 
planning to extend the visas of chinese students already in the 
united states fearing theyll be punished for supporting the 
protests but has not relaxed the rules for those who actually 
marched to tianamen square 
our government could close the door at any time said one 
woman whose husband is studying in the united states why does the 
united states say he can stay but not let me go see him

atlanta has long been a magnet for homosexuals in 
the southeast who felt theyd never be accepted in smaller towns 
its a little island of enlightenment in a sea of bigotry 
said gil robinson a lobbyist for several atlanta gay groups 
theyve never been forced to take to the streets to fight for 
equality here but with an estimated 300000 homosexuals in the 
metropolitan area the gay community has become a wellorganized 
potent political force nowhere has that been more apparent than in 
the race to succeed mayor andrew young 
i think gay and lesbian people here are becoming a real 
political power probably getting close to new york san francisco 
and los angeles said richard swanson administrator of the 
atlanta gay center 
fulton county commission chairman michael lomax and former mayor 
maynard jackson the two leading democratic candidates in the oct 3 
election until lomax dropped out this month vigorously campaigned 
in the gay community 
both had detailed platforms on gay issues promising to seek 
funds for housing for people with aids to appoint gay men and 
lesbians to city posts and to establish police task forces to combat 
unprovoked assaults on homosexuals 
the citys gay population has never before been courted so 
openly said jeffrey laymon executive secretary of the metropolitan 
atlanta council of gay and lesbian organizations we do have the 
numbers now the political situation has changed they have to pay 
attention 
even those who oppose affirmativeaction programs inclusion of 
homosexuals agree that atlantas gay population has developed some 
muscle 
i think its antifamily and its antigod said nancy 
schaefer chairwoman of citizens for public awareness which has 
fought to repeal a city ordinance amendment giving gay residents 
protection from discrimination atlanta has become a haven for 
homosexuals she said 
unlike san francisco or new york the rise of gay power here came 
not with a surge of militancy but rather gradually gay activism 
surfaced in america in the early 1970s and by the time atlantas 
homosexual population reached significant numbers much of the work 
had already been done 
by 1980 attitudes about equality had already changed or 
moderated across the country swanson said there probably 
wasnt a great need to get out and march were able to achieve much 
more with a lowerkey approach 
he cited atlantas status as a center of the civil rights 
movement and its southern gentility for the lack of confrontation 
over gay issuesa lot of gay and lesbian people tend to be from 
the smaller towns in the south they still have a lot of that 
traditional southern mentality 
midtown atlanta a hodgepodge of highrise office towers 
comfortable neighborhoods nightclubs and shopping centers is the 
center of gay life but its a lifestyle that has been quietly woven 
into the citys society 
were invisible said marie murray of the greater atlanta 
political awareness committee gapac we dont just care about gay 
issues were interested in all of the issues that everybody else 
is 
still many gay activists say their greatest victory was the 1986 
addition of sexual orientation to an antidiscrimination ordinance 
it has survived one repeal effort cpa is trying again to have the 
amendment thrown out 
mrs schaefer said she does not believe a sexual preference group 
should be considered a minority particularly in affirmative action 
programs she does believe that heightened gay political power bodes 
ill for the city 
it concerns me where the city is heading when the morals of 
the city start falling apart we will suffer the consequences she 
said adding that the suburbs will become conservative in reaction 
to gay clout within the city 
many gay men and lesbians own prosperous businesses with money 
to contribute to politicians and are active in one or more of the 
dozens of gay and lesbian organizations that rate politics high on 
their agenda 
jackson campaign spokesman angelo fuster said the gay population 
is very important in building a successful coalition with 
atlantas black majority to win a citywide election and many 
politicians no longer fear a backlash if they openly support gay 
issues although there is a lot of homophobia it has lessened 
considerably he said 
lomax recently reached out for the gay vote with a proposal to 
include gayowned businesses in a study of fulton countys 
affirmative action program 
les hough a specialist in southern politics at georgia state 
university said the proposal shows the role gay voters especially 
white ones play in predominantly black atlanta by appealing to 
the margins to the singleissue groups you can solidify your white 
support he said 
in a close race it can make a big difference 
the prominence of gay issues in atlanta shows the differences 
between city and country in georgia where no gubernatorial 
candidates mention gay rights as an important platform plank he 
said anyone who had ambitions of statewide office in georgia 
would downplay gay rights issues in any race 
swanson said gay men and lesbians have simply become part of the 
fabric of atlanta coming of age along with the fastgrowing city 
a high percentage of the gay people in atlanta now have 15plus 
years of being involved in the community all that is paying off 
now

the power struggle within the tamil 
minority claims new victims every night as gunfire reverberates 
throughout this warbattered town 
we are now so brutalized that revenge revenge and more revenge 
is our credo we are wiping out our own tamil youth said 
vellupillai balakumar general secretary of the eelam peoples 
revolutionary organization of students 
balakumars group known by its acronym eros is widely thought 
to have close ties with the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the 
most powerful tamil guerrilla group 
for the past 22 months the tigers have fought the indian 
peacekeeping troops who were sent to disarm them but they also are 
part of a shadowy war for supremacy within the tamil community 
nights in jaffna are shattered by gunfire and explosions 
visitors who ask the staff at the gnanam hotel one of the few 
jaffna hostelries still open what is going on receive a stock 
answer nothing sir somebody is doing some target practice 
the next morning the targets young tamil men are found lying 
in pools of blood in the streets of jaffna and surrounding villages 
we dont know who is killing whom but the dead turn up almost 
as a ritual every morning and the sounds of gunfires explosions 
crying and wailing are part of our daily nightlife a senior tamil 
newspaper editor said on condition of anonymity 
the brutalization has reached such an extent that it is part of 
our lives he said no one is interested even in knowing who a 
dead corpse is 
like many jaffna residents he blamed the bulk of the killings on 
the eelam peoples revolutionary liberation front whose members are 
permitted by the indian troops to carry arms openly 
the liberation front and two other tamil groups support the 
indian presence and have the most to lose if the indian soldiers 
depart leaving them to the mercy of the tiger guerrillas the 
front once a guerrilla organization has entered politics and 
controls the provincial administrative council 
tamil militants and civic leaders estimate at least 10000 people 
have died in predominantly tamil northeastern sri lanka since july 
30 1987 when indian troops arrived to enforce a peace accord 
designed to give the ethnic minority a measure of autonomy thats 
far above the estimate from sri lankan and indian government 
sources whose total since the tamil revolt began in 1983 comes to 
11000 
tamil rebels initially accepted the indiansponsored peace plan 
but the tigers soon reneged and began attacking the foreign soldiers 
sent to disarm them scoresettling and power struggles broke out 
among the erstwhile tamil guerrilla allies 
the tigers said they wanted a separate homeland not autonomy 
militants in the tamil community said they needed a separate state 
to preserve their hindu faith tamil language and combat what they 
said was discrimination by the islands sinhalese majority 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
sinhalese who are mostly buddhist and control the government 
account for 75 percent 
the violence that worries people in jaffna which used to have a 
population of 150000 but now suffers constant migration is 
reflected by the prevalence of bodies 
taxi drivers when asked if they know where to find any victims 
of the previous nights gunfire tend to respond as nadarajah 
sivagurunathan did when a passenger hopped in his 35yearold morris 
minor 
there are two bodies in kondavil one near nallur two others 
at kokuvil but one closer to jaffna town near the railway line 
sivagurunathan said reeling off a list of locations within five 
miles of downtown jaffna where shall we go 
by nightfall in the courtyard of the gnanam hotel a tamil 
crooner sings a love song 
the night scares me because you are not here by me 
why do you expose my vulnerability to a cruel world 
come here and hold my hand i am scared he sings to the 
hotel staff and a halfdozen guests 
suddenly his tamillanguage song is punctuated by the 
alltoofamiliar sound of machine gunfire and screams 
the singer pauses and reassures his listeners in english 
nothing sir only target practice

recently invited to visit by the north korean government as it shows 
signs of wanting to end its long isolation

blond blueeyed american soldiers 
with wolflike grins claws for hands and long hooked noses leer 
from the walls of the war museum in rural sinchon county 
the passage of 36 years has not softened north koreans attitudes 
toward the army they maintain was the aggressor in the 195053 
korean war between the chineseaided north and unbacked south 
in the 11 rooms of the sinchon museum north korea presents what 
it says is evidence that american soldiers of the un force killed 
35383 civilians while occupying the country for 52 days from 
october to dec 7 1950 
the claims never have been investigated by neutral parties nor 
have claims in south korean that northern forces committed similar 
atrocities there the sides divided at the end of world war ii when 
japanese forces withdrew remain technically at war the fighting 
was ended only by truce not a peace treaty 
sinchon museum guides tell the atrocity stories with impassioned 
conviction to about 1000 north korean visitors each day many of 
them schoolchildren reinforcing the prevailing image here of the 
united states as a warmonger bent on exterminating all koreans 
glass cases hold firecharred cloth shoes said to be from women 
and children locked in storehouses without food or water and 
eventually burned to death by the americans 
other cases hold swatches of black hair some still braided and 
caked with mud said to have been recovered from the corpses of 
women weighted down by stones and thrown into a reservoir 
there is a dagger said to have been used to cut out the eyeballs 
of civilians and a gasoline can with usa on the side that allegedly 
was used to start one of the massacre fires 
the horrific accounts are illustrated by artists reconstructions 
in which all the americans are blond with impossibly long hooked 
noses and evil grins 
the soldiers allegedly drove nails into a local official sawed 
off the head of a teacher and tied a worker to two horsedrawn 
carts then sent the horses in opposite directions 
the workers son chu sangwon then 5 years old is said to have 
been one of only two children who survived a mass burning of 400 
women and 102 children in two brick storehouses on dec 7 1950 the 
final day of occupation 
the younger chu now 43 and with three children of his own gives 
tours at the museum and daily retells the story of the burning 
i was covered by a thick blanket it was very cold chu 
said suddenly there was a big noise everything was burnt and i 
lost consciousness he said he was protected by the blanket and 
dead bodies his mother burned to death he said 
the short sunburned man told his story briefly with no sign of 
emotion i hate those who committed such a coldblooded 
massacre he said but not the american people 
the storehouses are near the museum and are part of the tour but 
contain little to convince a doubter one was completely rebuilt 
after being destroyed by a bomb later in the war the other has a 
new concrete floor and reinforced walls 
muddy blackandwhite photographs also are shown to support the 
stories but it is clear only that they show large numbers of 
bodies a few are crudely doctored with portions obviously drawn in 
or superimposed from other photos 
but the museum clearly exists not to convince skeptics but to 
hand down accounts that the north koreans accept as history 
there seems to be no interest in punishing the alleged killers 
museum vice chairman im kyonsun said they have not tried to track 
down the american officer they claim ordered his troops to bury 
alive everything in this county 
im identified the soldier as d madden harrison but said his 
rank and unit were not known he was very cunning said im who 
fought in the war as a private 
while the other americans retreated south by land in november and 
december 1950 before a north koreanchinese advance harrison 
escaped by boat to an island im said 
there he served as an intelligence unit commander and organized 
sending agents to korea then we dont know what happened to him 
the museum contains only one photo of the mysterious harrison 
and that of his back someone has drawn several links of a chain 
hanging from his pocket 
the museum was opened in 1958 but new exhibits have been added 
over the years among them are photos of an unusual group of 
visitors the crew of the us navy ship pueblo captured for 11 
months in 1968 on charges of spying

a handsome charismatic 19th century 
african named cinque is the rallying point for a group of history 
buffs who want to raise funds for a statue of the leader of mutinous 
africans who commandeered a slave ship 
if organizers can raise the needed 100000 cinques statue 
would be placed near city hall not far from where the old new haven 
jail once stood where the africans were housed after their ship was 
brought to port following their mutiny 150 years ago this week 
across the street is the new haven green where the africans were 
supposedly taken out for daily exercise drawing hundreds of curious 
onlookers 
the aug 26 1839 mutiny and its aftermath galvanized 
abolitionists and led to a us supreme court decision in 1841 
allowing their return to their homeland 
the story of the bid for freedom which began as they were being 
transported from one side of cuba to another is gripping said 
historian howard jones a university of alabama professor who wrote 
a 1987 book on the case mutiny on the amistad 
it is a real epic in that it is the only time in history blacks 
were put in slavery and made it back home jones said in a 
telephone interview 
but the supreme court ruling was no watershed decision because 
the blacks were freed only on the basis of a technicality he said 
the court held only that the spaniards in cuba seeking the return 
of the africans had failed to prove they were their property 
justice joseph story who wrote the courts decision made it very 
clear that if they were legally slaves he could not have freed 
them jones said 
abolitionists saw the decision as taking an important step in 
stamping out slavery jones said in fact it wasnt but the 
impression was it did 
the real importance lies in the opportunity the amistad affair 
gave abolitionists to rally behind the africans to advertise the 
horrors of the slave trade jones said 
abolitionists were determined to get them before the american 
people to show them they were not animals jones said 
the case generated a tremendous amount of publicity and 
curiosity many people in the region had never see a black jones 
said jailers were said to have charged admission to give people a 
glimpse of the detainees 
at first they thought they were barbarians but then they saw 
these people were human beings and were greatly amazed by them he 
said 
cinque whose name was appropriated in the 1970s by the leader 
of californias radical symbionese liberation army kidnappers of 
newspaper heiress patricia hearst apparently had a tremendous 
amount of charisma and was extremely handsome jones said 
an oil portrait of him by the brother of a leading abolitionist 
will be prominently displayed during the new haven colony historical 
societys exhibit on the amistad affair 
an african art show is currently going on and a wide range of 
activities is planned throughout the year including lectures a 
drama and a community banquet a historian is preparing booklets on 
the affair to be used in local schools this fall

gary dotsons life these past dozen years was a 
rollercoaster ride he didnt start and couldnt stop until a new 
dna test helped do what his accuser turned tearful recanter never 
could clear him of rape 
a book and a movie are being considered a civil suit against the 
criminal justice system that set dotsons torturous odyssey in 
motion is possible and college is another option on his suddenly 
expanding horizon his lawyer says 
but thomas breen the attorney says the most important matter at 
hand is to return the 32yearold dotson to sound emotional footing 
lets be honest breen said he wasnt the most sympathetic 
character in the world but it would have been impossible for almost 
anyone to toe the line he had to walk especially someone with a 
drinking problem 
on the other hand anybody who doesnt have compassion or 
sympathy for a kid that was jailed for part of his life for a crime 
that never occurred well that person has a bigger problem than my 
client 
dotsons problems began in 1977 when cathleen crowell webb then 
a high school student claimed she had been sexually assaulted and 
identified dotson as her attacker she said in 1985 after she had 
moved to new hampshire that she was never attacked and had wrongly 
accused dotson 
but by then he had been convicted of the rape and sent to tough 
state prisons where he ended up serving six years based on mrs 
webbs recantation he was granted clemency by gov james r 
thompson allowing him to leave prison in may 1985 but the rape 
conviction stayed on his record 
finally last monday he was cleared when cook county circuit 
judge thomas fitzgerald vacated the 1979 rape conviction and 
prosecutors said they would not seek a new trial fitzgerald said 
recent dna tests of evidence from the rape case would be admissible 
if a new trial were held defense lawyers said the dna 
fingerprinting tests which did not exist a decade ago 
indicated dotson could not have been responsible for the semen found 
in mrs webbs panties 
prosecutors suggested that a lack of corroborating evidence and 
mrs webbs testimony would be greater obstacles to a second rape 
conviction than the new dna test 
mrs webbs recantation is still shrouded in mystery and her 
actions since coming forward in 1985 have had a negative impact on 
her future reliability as a witness said assistant cook county 
states attorney gayle shines 
dotson walked out of fitzgeralds courtroom last week looking 
tanned more fit and confident than he had in recent years 
its over dotson told a crowd of reporters as they say 
this is the first day of the rest of my life as far as im 
concerned my name has been cleared 
he said he harbored no animosity against mrs webb i forgave 
her a long time ago he said 
the role of mrs webb now of harrisville nh is puzzling 
mrs webb said she concocted the tale of rape because she feared 
she had become pregnant by a teenage boyfriend a bornagain 
baptist and the mother of three children she said obedience to 
god prompted her to come forward and recant her accusations 
she encountered ridicule in many quarters failed to convince a 
judge or thompson of dotsons innocence and gained little but 
notoriety for all the time and money expended 
yet she was heartened by last weeks developments 
i wanted to see garys name cleared she said during a 
television interview at her new hampshire home thats done but i 
wont feel right until his life is restored to where it was before i 
pointed the finger at him 
dotsons initial trial and appeal lasted two years draining his 
familys meager resources 
the four years since his 1985 release found him battling an 
alcohol problem arrested a halfdozen times for traffic violations 
and another time following a domestic disturbance he was put back 
behind bars several times he got married became a father and 
almost as quickly separated from his wife 
celebrity was a millstone bringing taunts from strangers in 
taverns and on the street but he was unwilling to give up the 
struggle to clear his name 
dotson was granted a temporary pass to attend last mondays 
hearing from the drug and alcoholabuse center where he had been 
serving a yearlong sentence for a parole violation he plans to 
spend at least another month there on a voluntary basis 
dotson of suburban county club hills is hoping to build on the 
bitter years he said schooling was his most immediate concern 
followed perhaps by a career in counseling 
ive been through enough to relate to a lot of problems he 
said

frankly fritz the schnauzer doesnt know 
an arpeggio from a doggie bone but when he plinkplonks a few notes 
on the family grand piano his mistress beams admiringly as if van 
cliburn himself were tickling the ivories 
as far as shirley mae ross is concerned fritz is a doggone 
sensation 
he is by far my best student says mrs ross who gives piano 
lessons to children in the living room of her suburban washington 
home hes not a pet hes an artist 
twelveyearold fritz has been playing the piano since he was 
a pup to show off for visitors he leaps to the keyboard frowns 
his shaggy eyebrows at a book of beethoven sonatas and taps out a 
chord or two with his front paws 
fritz then races into the kitchen and wagging his stubby tail 
waits next to a cabinet door for his reward a dog biscuit 
he has to be paid immediately says mrs ross he belongs 
to the dog musicians union 
he gets a biscuit and a half for overtime presumably he plays 
ad nauseam she says its almost impossible to stop him 
this spring fritz became something of a celebrity when he 
appeared in a new book titled dogs and their women published by 
little brown and co there on page 15 is a picture of fritz 
seated at the piano with his mistress supposedly playing a duet 
get cracking shirley or we wont end together fritz is 
saying in the photo caption 
elsewhere in the book a testament in words and pictures to the 
love affairs between some women and their dogs is the woman who 
said she replaced a sixfoot swedish husband with a fivepound 
dog another is shown in her wedding gown kissing the dog who was 
her maid of honor flower girl best man and the one who gave me 
away 
mrs ross was grieving over the death of her previous schnauzer 
when her husband denwood f ross jr an official at the nuclear 
regulatory commission brought fritz home as a 6weekold 
replacement hes slept under the covers in my arms every since 
she said 
at the urging of her piano pupils mrs ross taught fritz how to 
play 
he loved to tear up kleenex tissues so i put some kleenex on 
the piano keys and when hed hit a note inadvertently id say 
oh fritz you wonderful dog and feed him a biscuit she said 
he was trained within a week he just loves to play the piano and 
he has perfect pitch 
fritz accompanies mrs ross to nursing homes and senior citizen 
centers where his keyboard performances are eagerly awaited he 
plays three movements interrupted by applause and munchies she 
says 
usually fritz plays an andante first then a largo for the 
second movement and he always ends with a presto she said he 
does cadenzas all over the place everything he does is cadenzas 
when fritz travels he carries his own suitcase packed with a 
jogging suit a plaid raincoat and a mink coat its fake of 
course but we mustnt let him know that mrs ross whispers 
when they visit her father in oil city pa at christmas time 
she says fritz wears a santa claus suit to perform at the nursing 
home 
he hates it because the cap flops down over his eyes when he 
plays she said

five months after he retired from a 16year 
career in congress missouri republican gene taylor reached into his 
old campaign fundraising account and took home 345000 
it was perfectly legal thanks to a decadeold law but even so 
taylors decision highlights a practice that is drawing criticism as 
ethics questions simmer in congress 
president bush has proposed outlawing the practice and the senate 
already has voted to ban it the debate could shift this fall to the 
house which has vigorously resisted such proposals because its 
members are the ones that would be affected and they have millions 
of dollars at stake 
it amounts to a special interestfinanced retirement fund 
complains susan manes of common cause a government watchdog group 
that advocates an overhaul of the system for financing congressional 
campaigns 
the ethics spotlight has been trained on congress said ms 
manes 
advocates of a change in campaign finance law say lawmakers may 
have to act on the issue soon to salve public concerns over ethics 
scandals in congress such as the one that led to the resignation of 
house speaker jim wright 
taylor belongs to an exclusive club of current and former house 
members permitted under a 10yearold law to take leftover cash from 
their reelection treasuries for personal use after they leave 
office 
according to records of the federal election commission taylor 
has converted more surplus campaign cash to personal use than any 
other former lawmaker but taylor bristles at the attention the news 
media have given his use of campaign donations 
i havent done anything wrong says taylor i do a lot of 
things out there for public service im going to use some of it for 
that 
the law allows house members in office before jan 8 1980 to 
convert excess campaign money to personal use 
currently 191 house members are covered by that grandfather 
clause and they had cash reserves of 39 million in their 
reelection accounts at the start of the year 
rep stephen solarz dny had 116 million at the end of june 
and rep dan rostenkowski dill had 101 million in his campaign 
account 
a senate rule prohibits current and former members from spending 
campaign money for personal use but practically speaking it cant 
be enforced once a senator leaves office house rules prohibit 
current members from spending campaign money for personal use 
any retiring house or senate member can contribute leftover 
campaign money to a political party other political campaigns 
charitable organizations or transfer the money to a trust or 
foundation for educational scientific or religious purposes 
some members return the money to contributors but former members 
have transferred at least 862000 in surplus campaign money to 
personal use after leaving office since 1980 according to a report 
earlier this year by congressional quarterly 
when taylor left office in january his campaign committee listed 
a balance of 457938 during the first six months of this year he 
contributed 64200 to churches and colleges in southwest missouri 
gave 2500 to political candidates and spent about 8600 on other 
items including automobile insurance and airline tickets 
at the end of june he transferred 345000 to himself by writing 
two personal checks campaign money converted to personal use is 
subject to state and federal taxation and taylor estimates nearly 
40 percent of the transfer will go for taxes 
last month the senate approved a bill to repeal the loophole 
when donors contribute to a political candidate they do so with 
an understanding that their money will be used to further the 
candidates campaign not to augment his or her personal wealth 
said sen richard shelby dala the sponsor of the repeal 
legislation 
president bush has offered another solution proposing to bar 
candidates from carrying over campaign money from one election to 
another a house task force also is studying the issue as it tries 
to develop an ethics and campaign finance package

the white house apparently will have to settle 
a dispute among federal agencies over whether to allow the sale of 
supercomputers to brazil india and israel which are known to be 
involved in nuclear weapons programs a congressional source says 
the pentagon and cia oppose the sales because intelligence 
experts believe the supercomputers could be used to help design 
nuclear weapons and missiles the source said on sunday 
the commerce and state departments favor the exports the source 
said 
there is a deadlock between the agencies and its going to come 
up to the white house for a political decision said the source 
who spoke sunday on condition that he not be identified 
israel brazil and india are without question pursuing 
activities related to either nuclear weapons or longrange missiles 
or both the congressional source said and with the facilities 
which they the supercomputers are going to there is ample reason 
to believe there are either direct or indirect connections to the 
weapons programs 
at issue are applications to export a cray research inc 
supercomputer to technion a technical university in israel an ibm 
supercomputer for the university of sao paulo in brazil another ibm 
machine for embraer sa an aircraft enterprise largely owned by 
the brazilian government and a cray computer for the indian 
institute of technology in bangalore 
you have the state department trying to smooth relations with 
friendly nations you have the commerce department trying to promote 
exports said the source who is closely involved with nuclear 
proliferation issues 
on the other hand youve got the intelligence community 
concerned no 1 about illicit uses of those computers and no 2 
about possible soviet access to some of those systems 
objections to the proposed supercomputer exports were voiced at 
meetings earlier this year held by the special nuclear export 
committee or snec a panel of senior federal agency staff members 
after snec failed to reach a consensus the issue was referred to 
a group of higherlevel officials from various agencies the policy 
coordinating committee chaired by reginald bartholomew 
undersecretary of state for security assistance science and 
technology 
gary milhollin a professor at the university of wisconsin law 
school and expert on the spread of nuclear weapons said the 
supercomputer dispute remains before the policy coordinating 
committee 
theyre kicking it around but they havent come to a 
decision he said cray has been lobbying very strenuously to 
get these exports approved and the commerce department is very 
sympathetic so its possible the commerce department could 
shortcircuit this policy coordinating committee and just decide the 
case on its own 
whatever course the administration takes on the supercomputer 
issue milhollin said it will have broad implications for future 
exports of other sensitive products 
i think that when the united states decides what to export by 
way of dualuse military and nonmilitary items one of the 
primary considerations should be the precedential effect of the 
export on us credibility milhollin said 
he pointed to a recent tightening of export regulations by west 
germany after us officials voiced strong concerns over the 
involvement of german firms with construction of a suspected 
chemicalweapons plant in libya 
when a really terrible export decision by a foreign country 
comes up were not going to have any credibility in trying to 
reverse it if we are going to send dualuse items to countries such 
as india israel and brazil milhollin said 
the nuclear proliferation expert said there currently is no 
evidence that these countries would get supercomputers from japan if 
the united states refuses to supply the machines 
my understanding is that the japanese are not competing for 
these sales milhollin said its conceivable that if we dont 
make these sales sometime in the future japan could make them but 
nobody knows whether the time will ever arrive

clayton yeutter may be a household name at the 
agriculture department but white house guards are pretty fussy 
about people who dont carry identification 
as secretary of agriculture he breezes in and out of usda with 
hardly a glance from the security guards 
but ron hall of the departments office of information says 
yeutter was looked over carefully a while back when he tried to 
enter the white house fitness center for an hourlong workout 
as hall tells it in the august issue of usda news a monthly 
publication for employees he accompanied yeutter his press 
secretary kelly shipp and photographer byron schumaker to gather 
background and pictures for an article about yeutters physical 
fitness drill 
three of the group flashed their usda identification cards but 
yeutter had grabbed his workout clothes and forgot his id 
no problem his three companions swore that yeutter was indeed 
yeutter and that he was secretary of agriculture hall said the 
guard was dubious the secretary was bemused 
finally hall remembered that he had an earlier issue of his 
publication which showed yeutter being sworn in by supreme court 
justice sandra day oconnor with president bush looking on 
hall showed it to the guard who studied the photo and studied 
it some more 
uhhh the secretary is the one in the center of the photo with 
his right hand in the air taking the oath of office hall said 
finally the guard looked up and said to yeutter is your first 
name clayton 
yes yeutter replied 
ok you can all go in the guard said 
hall reported that yeutter ran on a treadmill pumped iron and 
performed other physical feats that the 58yearold nebraskan uses 
to blow away the tension of his job 
yeutter who is 510 said that having grown up on a farm he 
likes meat potatoes and gravy as well as dessert especially 
anything chocolate 
thats why im here working out he said 
yeutter said his weight rose to 200 pounds before beginning to 
work out at the center when he was us trade representative and he 
wants to get down to 190 hes at about 195 now

the united states is still the leading supplier 
of chicken to japan but the margin may be narrowing a bit says an 
agriculture department report 
a strong yen and growing demand among fastfood restaurants 
pushed japans total 1988 chicken imports to a record 280000 metric 
tons the departments foreign agricultural service said 
imports of us chicken were reported at 118000 tons followed 
by thailand with 81000 tons other leading providers included 
brazil 34000 tons and china 21000 tons 
since increased domestic production is unlikely trade sources 
forecast chicken imports at 300000 tons in 1989 the report said 
but there is stiffer competition this year 
japans total chicken imports in the first four months of 1989 
rose about 15 percent from the same period of last year but the 
us share declined sharply the report said 
bryant h wadsworth us agricultural ministercounselor in

recent report that farm banks have been successful in augmenting 
and preserving a strong capital position despite large loan losses 
and low profits in the mid1980s 
by contrast he said nonfarm banks which continue to be 
affected by problems in energy related industries experienced a 
decline in returns on equity in 1988 for the fourth consecutive year 
returns for those banks dropped to 869 percent from 919 percent 
in 1987 and 1116 percent four years ago 
the farm bank study was compiled from data provided by the 
federal deposit insurance corp from 1982 through 1988 by 
association economist carlos veintemillas and was published in the 
associations journal of agricultural lending

mystery pilot thomas root who admits making 
more than 1 million helping investors get radio station licenses 
represented a new breed of broadcasters who wouldnt know hifi 
from hamburgers a critic says 
these wouldbe station owners are the offspring of reaganera 
deregulatory policies that made it easier to acquire a radio station 
license than grab a burger king franchise says andrew schwartzman 
executive director of the media access project a washington public 
interest group 
the new rules which opened the way for building hundreds of new 
stations under looser regulations have attracted investors who 
would rather buy and sell broadcasting rights than serve the public 
schwartzman says 
and the licenses are free 
as far as theyre concerned the only difference between a 
burger king franchise and a broadcast license is the one from burger 
king is not free schwartzman said in an interview friday 
schwartzman said he hopes new fcc chairman alfred sikes a former 
missouri broadcaster will understand the error of the ways of 
the past commission 
the commission has said it is considering using lotteries for 
granting station licenses in the future 
root a washington communications attorney drew public attention 
to this newage radio business when he crashed his small plane into 
the atlantic ocean on july 13 he had been on his way to a 
deposition in rocky mount nc on behalf of an fm station 
investment group he was representing before the federal 
communications commission 
root said he passed out at the controls and his plane ran out of 
gas in the bahamas after a sixhour flight from washington doctors 
in florida later discovered he had been shot in the stomach root 
says he doesnt know how and federal authorities are investigating 
root missed the deposition and the application was dismissed 
one of many dismissals he is alleged to have caused while 
representing more than 160 fm investment groups organized by sonrise 
management services of columbus ga 
sonrise later broke off its relationship with root and brought 
suit against him for allegedly failing to perform work and 
doublebilling 
sonrises former chairman ralph savage told reporters that some 
7000 investors pumped 25 million into sonrise operations although 
only one sonriserelated radio station has reached the construction 
phase 
the new era of buyandsell resulted from several fcc actions in 
the early 1980s including new rules that opened the way for more 
than 700 new fm stations nationwide schwartzman said 
these changes have brought in a new breed of broadcaster who is 
not concerned with serving the public but profiting from obtaining 
and selling licenses schwartzman said 
licenses are granted based on an applicants standing in the 
community and financial wellbeing while consideration also is 
given to those with minority or female ownership 
but the commission decided to allow stations to be sold as often 
as every year dropping the previous threeyear minimum period of 
ownership only general partners must disclose financial 
information while limited partners do not have to make such 
disclosure 
limits were lifted on how much money one applicant can pay to buy 
out another applicants bid for the same license 
the fcc also temporarily repealed rules requiring applicants to 
prove their financial qualifications although that requirement was 
reinstated in april 
the combination of these things made it possible to set up 
these deals where they were confident there wouldnt be intensive 
scrutiny and where they were confident that they could sell a 
license as soon as it was obtained schwartzman said 
sonrise advertising itself as offering management with a 
christian ethic brought together investors who wanted into fm 
radio 
sonrise said root was paid 19 million in advance and root told 
the washington post he received 16 million 
the fcc is investigating sonrise for possible abuse of commission 
rules and possible criminal conduct hearings are planned on whether 
sonrise illegally controlled some 40 partnerships and any 
information about possible criminal violations could be turned over 
to the justice department said agency spokeswoman mary catherine 
kilday 
sonrise officials have denied any wrongdoing

when youre the fifth greatgrandson 
of thomas jefferson and bear eerie resemblance to your famous 
forebear its sometimes hard to remember which century you live in 
just ask rob coles 
coles 36 is a living breathing spitting image of the man most 
americans know only from the pages of their history textbooks 
the sixfoottwoinch redhaired virginian resembles jefferson 
right down to the freckles and he has spent much of the last 10 
years impersonating his illustrious ancestor in a oneman show 
called meet thomas jefferson 
he was hospitalized for three months earlier this year for what 
he called a manic break when he thought he really was 
jefferson he said he takes lithium to help keep the delusion under 
control 
the similarities are remarkable 
coles hails from jeffersons hometown of charlottesville where 
he lives about four miles from the third presidents monticello 
home his lineage is impeccable descended on his mothers side from 
jeffersons daughter martha and on his fathers side from 
jeffersons secretary edward coles 
he shares jeffersons angular profile and speaks with the same 
virginia gentlemans accent 
hes remarkably like images and descriptions of jefferson 
says cinder stanton director of research at monticello 
but coles isnt exactly like the man who penned the declaration 
of independence 
whats underneath the red hair is the big difference said 
coles who flunked out of the university of virginia that his 
forefather founded 
jefferson obviously was sort of a genius he said i never 
did very well in school 
coles said he would like to know if jefferson shared any of his 
less weighty traits 
i would like to ask him about his college days coles said 
how much of a rowdy he was how much fun he had in college 
the other members of his family whose resemblance to jefferson 
is limited to their ruddy hair are little affected by their 
prominent progenitor coles said 
theyre all normal people and have normal jobs 
coles had never acted before he began playing jefferson 
depressed and looking for something to do after dropping out of 
college at age 26 he took up on a professors suggestion that he 
capitalize on his resemblance to virginias favorite son 
coles show which he has performed around the country includes 
family stories about jefferson that have been passed down orally 
through the generations as well as tales about jeffersons 
presidency and the years before his death 
i try to emphasize just how completely alien jeffersons 
society is to our society he said there were only four million 
people in the whole country which is the size today of greater 
philadelphia theyre two different worlds 
coles has spent enough time with his character that he sometimes 
feels as if he is jefferson 
there are times you get so immersed in what youre doing you 
forget what century youre in he said its hard not to get 
carried away with it 
but he says he has never thought of escaping his jeffersonian 
legacy by leaving charlottesville or finding a different vocation 
i think ill do it for the rest of my life he said what 
else can i do 
even so coles admits that he sometimes gets tired of being 
jefferson 
its just like anything else he said there are days you 
wake up and you feel like thomas jefferson and days you want to roll 
over and go back to sleep

a year ago when striking miners demanded 
restoration of solidaritys legal status the communist government 
rejected it right away today not only is the independent union 
legal but one of its leaders has been nominated prime minister 
i have been fighting for this for a long time and even a few 
days ago it was unrealistic solidarity leader lech walesa said 
after his aide tadeusz mazowiecki was picked saturday to lead the 
government 
what was once viewed as impossible has happened in poland 
for seven years people risked arrest for even showing the 
solidarity logo now members of parliament wear it on their lapels 
shoppers bear it on their tote bags and everyone sees it on a banner 
stretched across warsaws main square 
opposition activists jailed for daring to challenge to the 
government now are legislators all three of the men president 
wojciech jaruzelski considered for prime minister were put behind 
bars by his 1981 martiallaw crackdown 
walesa is seen daily on state television foreign broadcasts are 
not jammed and there are legal independent newspapers poles can 
legally buy dollars and private enterprise is encouraged 
to be sure there is much that has not changed there is no 
reason to believe the secret police have disbanded or the tapping of 
telephones has ended indeed communists remain entrenched in 
positions of political and economic power and censorship exists 
though it is much relaxed 
perhaps most painfully shelves are still empty not only of the 
typical trappings of 20th century life but basic commodities long 
lines for staples such as bread continue and poland with the 
worlds fourthlargest foreign debt at 39 billion has worsened 
economically 
despite the rapid pace of change mazowieckis first words after 
being nominated prime minister exhorted poles to believe in the 
future 
i think the most difficult task will be to make people think 
that it can be better he said 
the trickleturnedflood of change could hardly have been 
imagined 12 months ago let alone in the past 45 years since 
sovietbacked communists took power in postwar poland 
in january 1988 government spokesman jerzy urban dismissed 
solidarity as a historical monument and said walesa no longer 
represents the millions of members of the former solidarity 
who do not expect the leaders of an outdated institution to 
represent them 
on aug 26 1988 less than a week after telling strikers that 
legalizing solidarity was unrealistic the government pressed by 
widening labor unrest and increasingly aware it was unable to 
control the economy offered to negotiate with solidarity 
five months later the communist party completed a dramatic 
political aboutface and opened the way for restoring legal status 
to the independent movement it had spent eight years fighting 
walesa though watched in the west went virtually unmentioned in 
the official polish press except occasionally as a private person 
a former leader of a former union or a tool of foreign powers 
when necessary his face was edited out of group photos 
only in september did he enter newspaper pages and television 
screens he remained there during the roundtable talks with 
communist authorities that unleashed political and trade union 
reforms 
by june solidarity candidates were allowed to run for all 100 
seats in the newly created freely elected senate and 161 of the 460 
seats in the lower house or sejm they won all but one 
on july 4 walesa and jaruzelski were photographed sitting side 
by side in the parliament chambers as the first elected opposition 
delegation in the east bloc in four decades took its seats 
the changes have touched many other aspects of polish expression 
until april the government controlled all publications and the 
paper they were printed on independent thought was published in 
microscopic print on scrounged paper by underground journalists 
deliveries were made in secret 
now there are legal independent daily and weekly newspapers 
produced on government presses with an approved paper allocation 
in december 1987 when five demonstrators chained themselves to a 
lamp post on a warsaw shopping street chanting no freedom without 
solidarity a crowd gathered to watch the protest that took 
singular courage and was likely to bring serious trouble 
hardly a head turned in july 1989 when a banner proclaiming 
jaruzelski must go hung on the same street for two days 
only in january did poles receive the right to keep passports at 
home 
political activists were not allowed to travel and as recently as 
march 1988 walesa was denied a passport to attend a trade union 
congress in australia since december walesa has been to france 
twice to italy and belgium 
not only is the longtaboo world war ii massacre of scores of 
polish officers at katyn now discussed openly but the government is 
pressing the soviet union to accept responsibility for the crime 
in history books marshal jozef pilsudski a hero for 
establishing polish statehood in 1918 was officially repudiated for 
saying i rode the red streetcar of socialism but got off at the 
stop called independence now he is officially honored

a studentled initiative aimed at safer sex 
will allow university of minnesota students this fall to buy condoms 
from the same dormitory vending machines offering chocolate bars and 
pretzels 
id rather not see anyone die said joe westrup a university 
senior and dormitory resident who helped propose the initiative 
thats the main thing sex is a pretty scary thing now 
the university plans to stock and sell the condoms in packages of 
three for a dollar in snack machines in campus residence halls and 
student unions here 
some students say the idea will be difficult to get used to 
i think aids is a big problem that has to be stopped but to 
sell condoms in vending machines i think is going too far said 
junior choua vang i think they should be sold in drug stores 
getting condoms to students outside the walls of the campus 
health service is a goal many institutions are tackling 
the state of maryland distributes condoms free to university of 
maryland students and others through a three for free program 
ohio state university is selling condoms in cigarette machines 
and at bookstores in january it plans to phase out cigarette sales 
and will switch the condom supplies to candy machines 
the university of virginia sells condoms in public areas 
as much as anything i think theyre a symbol that the 
university cares about the students health said jim mitchell 
associate director of student health at the university of virginia 
students make their own choices were saying if youre going to 
be sexually active use condoms 
mitchell said administrators expected student controversy over 
the wider condom distribution on campus but have not discovered any 
kathleen matthews director of health education at minnesotas 
boynton health service said new evidence suggests the aids virus is 
becoming more prevalent on college campuses 
a random national sampling of college students released last 
spring showed 30 college students out of 16861 tested positive for 
the aids virus 
the 02 percent rate alarmed researchers said wally brewer 
project associate with the college health association which 
conducted the survey with the atlantabased centers for disease 
control 
the incidence was cause for concern it was higher than we 
expected brewer said 
dormitory leaders at the university of minnesota came up with 
their proposal during the 198788 school year they approached eight 
university residence halls for approval before presenting the plan 
to administrators 
westrup said students complained that it is difficult to find a 
pharmacy that is conveniently located or open late at night for 
impromptu condom purchases 
matthews said the condom vending packs also will contain 
informational brochures 
linda ellinger acting vice president for student development 
said the university supports the program 
we felt strongly that it was a student initiative our students 
wanted it and there is enough evidence of the seriousness of aids 
and its spread to warrant it ellinger said

woodstock anniversary celebrants packed up 
and left a muddy field here a final reminder of the rock n roll 
festival 20 years ago that for many defined a generation 
by sunday only about 3500 people remained of the more than 
20000 that showed up over the last three days the sloping alfalfa 
field 110 miles northwest of new york city was soaked by rain much 
as it was in august 1969 when 400000 attended the woodstock music 
and art festival 
police expect most of the revelers to be gone by today 
this is it said sullivan county sheriff joseph wasser 
pronouncing an end to a celebration that had no official backing 
from county or town authorities once people began arriving in large 
numbers however the town of bethel supplied portable toilets and 
water 
the gathering was marred when a man was stabbed in the abdomen 
during a fight saturday night 
joseph basto 39 of newburgh remained in critical condition 
today at harris community general hospital officials said sullivan 
county sheriff joseph wasser said no arrest was made and police were 
interviewing witnesses on sunday 
despite that incident and a few drugrelated arrests the 
anniversary like its predecessor was mostly peaceful the first 
people arrived weeks ago at the site 110 miles northwest of new york 
city which some consider hallowed ground 
this isnt being cosmic or crazy but whenever you walk on this 
land when theres no people here you can feel it said will 
hoppey one of the coordinators of the weekends entertainment 
when the wind is right and the grass is high you can kind of 
hear some of the old stuff the groups its always been special 
said steve bergkamp 
most said they were drawn by memories and the hope that some of 
the original concerts performers would return only one did 
melanie she sang two songs on a makeshift stage complementing the 
entertainment provided mostly by local musicians 
others made it a weekend camping trip and twoday beer party 
we had nothing to do for the weekend said 21yearold evan 
lubell we thought wed get a blanket and drink some beer 
cars buses tents tarps and campfires dotted the hillside that 
once held a mass of humanity medical personnel were swamped with 
drugrelated cases 20 years ago but over the weekend most people 
brought to a firstaid station were treated for cut feet and stubbed 
toes 
some just had too much to drink one man passed out facedown on 
the sloping field someone was thoughtful enough to place a 
fluorescent traffic cone next to his head 
some people looked as if they never left the 60s long hair and 
beards were in the majority and tiedyed clothing was the uniform 
of the day 
bergkamp who was here in 69 and wears his silver hair to his 
shoulders tried to convince his 15yearold son to come along 
he told me thats corny stuff thats old hippie stuff 
bergkamp said 
i said to him and you call me a drag

striking eastern workers rallied in the airlines 
largest hub to try to rekindle public support for their 5monthold 
walkout 
the rally by about 1000 people sunday was part of a motorcade 
that began aug 12 in miami and was billed by the striking 
machinists pilots and flight attendants as the longest picket 
line in american history 
the motorcade was to wind its way through various cities and end 
with a sept 6 rally in washington 
the strikers said they needed to put their plight back in the 
public eye and dispel the notion that easterns management was 
successfully rebuilding the carrier 
in recent weeks frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent 
texas air corp has won approval from creditors for a plan to 
revive the airline as a smaller more efficient carrier eastern 
virtually grounded at the outset of the strike in march has 
increased its flight schedule with the help of newly hired pilots 
and workers who have crossed picket lines 
atlanta easterns largest hub prior to the strike has been at 
the center of the rebuilding of the airline 
obviously people have forgotten about us said dick nellis 
a striking eastern pilot from atlanta who helped organize the 
georgia leg of the motorcade we havent done a good job in pr 
management is much more savvy about that 
we needed something like this for public awareness that 
were still out on strike 
the strikers who have charged that lorenzo is trying to 
dismantle eastern by selling off its assets raised a huge hotair 
balloon bearing the banner labor against lorenzo 
they also chanted antilorenzo slogans as they marched across the 
parking lot outside the atlanta civic center where a flatbed truck 
offered live music and series of speakers who urged the 
demonstrators to stick with the strike 
lorenzo is wrong and you are right and thats why youre going 
to win said democratic rep john lewis who also urged president 
bush to intervene in the strike 
bush he said can go to poland and stand with the workers of 
solidarity but you need to come home and stand with the workers of 
eastern 
in washington the leaders of the motorcade plan to present bush 
with a petition calling for the appointment of a federal trustee to 
manage eastern until the strike issues are resolved

nicholas hastings a british journalist for 
apdow jones a joint venture of the associated press and dow jones 
and co was aboard the marchioness when it sank sunday in the river 
thames here is his account 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was a perfect night for a party on the river 
and an unusually warm night which is probably what saved my life 
i had met with some friends and boarded the marchioness at 
charing cross pier as guests of a friend who had chartered the boat 
for his birthday party 
i was standing outside on the bow talking with my friends we 
had been sailing for about 20 minutes and we were laughing at 
various buildings we passed saying how awful they looked when 
suddenly there was a small jolt 
somebody screamed 
the first thing that ran through my mind was that we had hit 
something in the river but as i turned around i could see the 
enormous looming hull of the dredger that had hit us it was right 
on top of us 
as i did that somebody else yelled were going over and 
thats exactly what it did in a matter of seconds 
i was extremely lucky as i was standing on the lefthand side of 
the bow and the boat rolled to the right and as the boat rolled i 
was able to clamber over the hull and eventually found myself 
standing bonedry on top of the overturned keel 
i was the only person i could see everybody else had disappeared 
under the boat including two friends i was standing with 
i knew that my standing outside was what probably saved my life 
a colder day may have driven me below deck those below deck on the 
dance floor must have been dragged down with the marchioness 
but all of a sudden i realized that the boat was rocking back up 
slightly the first thought that came to my mind was that at least 
the others on board are going to be able to get out now but i 
realized it meant that i had to jump which i did 
i bobbed up some yards away from the boat and discovered myself 
being swept along in the very strong tidal current i realized there 
was no landing point nearby i knew i couldnt afford to go with the 
flow and decided to strike out for what appeared to be two moored 
barges and a glitter of a little patch of mud across the river 
luckily im a regular swimmer i jettisoned my glasses decided i 
didnt have time to get rid of my shoes 
after what seemed like a very long time i finally hit what felt 
like the bottom i stood in kneehigh water for the first time and 
what had been an eerie silence became the swiftly receding screams 
for help of the other passengers 
i then started shouting because i realized i couldnt get up the 
riverbank wall two police launches passed i screamed one stopped 
as if it had heard me then sped off again a man passed in a tiny 
skiff and didnt hear me 
by that stage i was fairly frantic id been in the water 10 or 
15 minutes and was getting cold 
i then saw two security guards from a building across the river 
running across the bridge they finally heard my shouts or caught 
sight of me 
they lowered a ladder and pulled me out of the water

japan became the worlds richest nation on paper in 
1987 surpassing the united states in national assets for the first 
time with 437 trillion worth of land factories stocks and other 
wealth a leading japanese newspaper said today 
the value of japans assets in 1987 jumped sharply from 283 
trillion worth of assets in 1986 said nihon keizai shimbun the 
countrys top economic daily quoting figures from the us federal 
reserve board and japans economic planning agency 
in 1985 japans assets were 196 trillion 11 trillion behind 
those of the united states the paper said it said the statistics 
at the end of 1987 were the latest available from the two countries 
officials of the economic planning agency said the statistics 
from japan and the united states were issued separately toward the 
end of last year but the agency did not make any specific 
comparison 
contributing to the rise in japans assets were soaring stock and 
land prices coupled with a nominal increase in the overall national 
assets due to the japanese currencys appreciation against the us 
dollar the report said 
on a yen basis japans national assets rose by 17 percent in 
1987 over the previous year mainly because of increases in stock 
and land prices while the yens value against the us dollar rose 
54 percent in 1987 the yen rose from about 160 yen to the dollar to 
about 122 yen from the end of 1986 to the end of 1987 the report 
said 
today the dollar closed at 14335 yen down 017 yen from 
fridays close 
national assets are the total value of financial assets such as 
stocks and deposits and insurance and actual assets such as 
production facilities housing land and inventories 
according to us federal reserve board figures the united 
states had 306 trillion in assets at the end of 1985 34 trillion 
worth in 1986 and 362 trillion in 1987 the newspaper said 
it said financial assets accounted for 53 percent of japans 
total national assets while the value of land made up 30 percent 
masaru yoshitomi chief of the economic planning agencys 
economic research institute told the paper that the scale of 
japans national assets shows japan has increased its position not 
only in industrial competitiveness but also in a very important 
part of the national power of financing 
the government reported last year japan had record net overseas 
assets of 240 trillion in 1987 making it the worlds largest 
creditor nation for the third year in a row

sinhalese radicals detonated a landmine 
under a sri lankan army jeep in the center of this island nation 
killing five soldiers and the civilian driver military officials 
said today 
the bodies of six other people five of them badly burned were 
found in the kandy hill district the officials added 
all 12 deaths occurred in a 24hour period ending at midday today 
in the same period government troops rounded up 645 suspected 
sinhalese radicals in a series of search operations in central and 
southern sri lanka the officials said speaking on condition of 
anonymity of these 440 were arrested in colombo and its suburbs 
the military officials blamed the latest killings on the peoples 
liberation front an ultranationalist sinhalese group that has been 
attacking the sinhalesedominated government the past two years the 
front accuses the government of making too many concessions to the 
tamil minority and of weakening the nations sovereignty by allowing 
indian peacekeeping troops to remain on the island 
however opposition politicians and front supporters have accused 
the government or governmenttolerated vigilante squads of 
responsibility for the charred bodies that turn up virtually every 
day in the sinhalese heartland senior government and military 
officials also have acknowledged privately that excesses have 
been committed in the governments fight against the sinhalese 
radicals 
the attack on the army patrol occurred sunday night in 
mahawehera about 85 miles northeast of colombo 
the bodies of the six other unidentified people were found after 
daybreak today in two locations in the district around kandy about 
55 miles northeast of colombo 
at least 4000 people have died in the sinhalese violence that 
started in 1987 while 11000 more have been killed in the tamil 
insurrection that began in 1983 in northeastern sri lanka 
sinhalese who make up 75 percent of sri lankas 16 million

the smithsonian institution failed to reach 
agreement with indian leaders on the return of indian skeletal 
remains to tribes for burial but officials said they laid the 
groundwork for a settlement 
i think were going to be able to make some progress rep 
ben nighthorse campbell dcolo said sunday by telephone from his 
ignacio colo ranch 
we have a gentlemens agreement to find a solution weve 
agreed on the direction of the talks but we dont have any firm 
language he said 
campbell said he met thursday in albuquerque with smithsonian 
secretary robert mccormick adams suzan harjo executive director of 
the national congress of american indians and walter echohawk a 
lawyer for the native american rights fund to listen in on 
negotiations 
i think generally the agreement were looking for is that if we 
can positively identify the remains as belonging to a tribal group 
or family or if we can locate where the remains were taken from 
then the smithsonian would be willing to return those campbell 
said 
many of the remains are untraceable however he said 
leslie logan of the smithsonians office of public affairs said 
one of the sticking points is whether the institution will return 
remains that were taken from certain locations but cant be traced 
to a particular family or tribal group 
the smithsonian has an estimated 35000 indian skeletons and 
other sacred objects and they have long been the source of 
bitterness among american indians who liken anthropologists and 
other collectors to grave robbers 
officials had hoped to announce an agreement on the remains 
saturday night during a reception at the wheelwright museum of the 
american indian in santa fe 
campbell and ms logan said officials would continue to meet 
during the next several weeks 
the national congress of american indians estimates the bones of 
25 million indians are held in public and private collections 
nationwide although museum spokesmen estimate the number is closer 
to 250000 
campbell said he hopes an agreement with the smithsonian will 
convince other museums and universities to return some remains from 
their collections 
ms logan said the smithsonian has agreed to negotiate in part 
because it is looking for support for its plans to build a national 
museum for the american indian in washington dc 
if approved by congress construction on the 175 million museum 
would begin in 1992 
meanwhile a sacred pole topped with a human scalp and said to 
symbolize tribal unity was presented to the omaha tribe in macy 
neb on sunday after being held 101 years in a boston museum 
the pole believed to more than 300 years old was entrusted to 
the peabody museum at harvard university by its last keeper yellow 
smoke because he doubted younger generations of omahas would 
cherish it tribal officials recently negotiated its return 
it will take up where it left off in 1888 tribal chairman 
doran morris said last month it is a central part of our lives 
it will influence our children and grandchildren

christian army commander gen michel aoun 
was quoted today as saying he was willing to hold a round table 
conference with moslem leaders to determine lebanons future 
government 
i am ready any time to discuss lebanons future at a round 
table with leaders of the other side aoun said in an interview 
published by the parisbased arabic magazine koll elarab 
he made no mention of his previous condition that any 
christianmoslem negotiations on political reforms should be 
preceded by the withdrawal of the syrian army from lebanon 
aouns remark was broadcast by christian and moslem radio 
stations as his 20000 mainly christian troops traded sporadic 
artillery and tank fire across beiruts dividing green line and in 
hills above the capital 
no casualties were reported by police count 784 people were 
killed and 2126 wounded since aouns confrontation with the syrians 
broke out march 8 
police said syrian gunners in moslem west beirut and in north 
lebanon pounded the coast of the christian port of byblos with 100 
shells and rockets overnight to turn back three ships carrying food 
to the beleaguered christian enclave 
the splinter moslem army command issued a communique today 
claiming its gunners scored hits on all three ships and prevented 
them from unloading arms and ammunition 
but sources at aouns command ridiculed the claim saying moslem 
army units in west beirut do not possess the longrange guns needed 
to hit byblos 20 miles north of beirut 
the poorly equipped moslem troops of the army estimated at 
22000 are largely scattered in remote areas in north east and 
south lebanon with only about 4000 in west beirut they have played 
no active role in the syrianchristian confrontation 
the syrians who maintain 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league are bent on preventing 
arms supplies from reaching the blockaded enclave home to 1 million 
christians 
beirut media reports said today that the dispatch of french 
warships to the eastern mediterranean was aimed at breaking the 
syrian siege 
the independent newspaper annahar quoted unidentified sources as 
saying the french flotilla would run the gauntlet of syrian 
shellfire and ensure the arrival of arms and fuel supplies to the 
enclave 
france has dispatched the aircraft carrier foch and destroyer 
duquesne to take positions off lebanons coast along with a navy 
hospital ship and fuel tanker for the declared purpose of evacuating 
7000 french passport holders from lebanon if the fighting worsened 
france is just giving a humanitarian excuse for its upcoming 
military intervention annahar quoted an unidentified 
highranking source in beirut as saying 
the french naval moves provoked a moslem uproar hezbollah or 
party of god irans main shiite moslem ally in lebanon has 
threatened antifrench suicide bombings 
druse warlord walid jumblatt whose 6000strong militia is 
backing the syrian army warned that a french intervention would 
hurt christian minorities throughout the middle east 
the revolutionary justice organization an underground group 
holding two american hostages warned in a statement released sunday 
night that their lives would be in peril if the french navy 
intervened in lebanon 
america which is spurring france on should realize that any 
foolhardiness by the french fleet will expose the life of its 
hostages to danger the statement said 
the group holds joseph cicippio 58 acting comptroller of the 
american university of beirut who was kidnapped sept 12 1986 and 
selfstyled writer edward austin tracy 58 who was abducted oct 21 
the same year 
in sidon provincial capital of south lebanon a freighter that 
has been smuggling food supplies and vegetables to the christian 
enclave was blown up by three bombs at the citys harbor at dawn 
today police said 
the vessel sank but its sevenman lebanese crew swam to shore 
unharmed according to a police spokesman 
this was the fourth freighter to be blown up in sidon for 
smuggling food to the christian enclave three were wrecked by 
similar explosions in june

forty years ago wesley brown became 
the first black man to throw his hat into the air at a us naval 
academy graduation 
his breakthrough didnt go unnoticed some people sent him hate 
mail but he also received 15 marriage proposals 
on saturday nearly 200 friends and family members honored brown 
at highland beach not far from where he won a personal and historic 
battle over racism letters of commendation including one from an 
old classmate and former president jimmy carter were read aloud 
the academy was 100 years old brown now 62 said i 
thought it was time 
when brown arrived at the academy in annapolis in 1945 he was 
the sixth black to enroll none of the others had made it past the 
first year though 
the first year was tough he said in his first semester he 
received 140 demerits 10 fewer than the limit before dismissal 
i didnt know if i got demerits because i was black or because 
i was a plebe said brown now a retired lieutenant commander with 
20 years of naval service behind him there are some times i got 
demerits i thought i didnt deserve 
he said he was not always treated unfairly someone once took 
apart his bedding to try to get him in trouble but the duty officer 
refused to punish him for it 
still brown roomed alone all four years when he sat down next 
to classmates they often stood up and left some refused to speak 
to him 
i didnt mind it so much brown said i had a goal i liked 
the navy i liked the naval academy 
i thought all the teachers and professors i had were certainly 
very fair he said and for the most part i got along with my 
classmates 
ensign dondi edwards 22 one of about 20 blacks who graduated 
this year said brown was a modernday hero without him there 
would have been no beginning for blacks at the naval academy 
where he stood 40 years ago now there are 237 black 
midshipmen edwards said there are about 4500 students overall 
at the academy 
browns wife crystal who blazed a trail of her own as one of 
only two black undergraduates at the university of vermont said she 
never doubted her husband would succeed 
these are things you did you were expected at that time to 
achieve she said we are all trailblazers today we are called 
minorities i never thought i was a minority i thought i was me 
thats how he is

there were mobs of teenagers pounding 
music and not enough toilets but pope john paul iis world youth 
day was far from your usual rock concert 
the celebration which actually lasted most of the weekend was 
intended as the highlight of a threeday papal visit to spain that 
ends today with mass at a mountain shrine in the northern town of 
covadonga 
on sunday the pontiff made his second call in five days for an 
end to 14 years of sectarian fighting in lebanon he appeared to 
refer to syrian soldiers and moslem militias when he said it 
seems that the intention is to destroy the city of beirut and in 
particular the zones inhabited by christians 
his comments came at the end of a mass at the vaticansponsored 
4th world youth day celebrations near santiago de compostela 
thousands of the estimated 400000 participants from 55 countries 
signed an appeal for peace in lebanon that was to be sent to the 
united nations 
the pope on sunday also visited a cathedral in the northern 
mining center of oviedo and spoke at a mass at a field outside the 
city 
world youth day marked one of the roman catholic churchs most 
spectacular efforts ever to reach young people featuring a 
glittering show with longhaired rock singers and an audience in 
blue jeans that clapped and danced most eventually camped out on 
big rectangles of plastic covering the orange clay of gozo mountain 
one participant from chicago 24yearold john kurt noted that 
americans marked the 20th anniversary of the woodstock concert in 
the same week as the huge papal gathering at an ancient pilgrim site 
people are going from dope to pope he quipped 
indeed many of those at the fourth world youth day celebrations 
came for one reason to see john paul 
he gives us such happiness its incredible remarked ramon 
verra 16 of mexico city 
in his farflung travels the 69yearold pope tries to use the 
force of his personality to convince young people of the importance 
of catholic values especially such unpopular ones as chastity 
but john paul had nothing less in mind this weekend than 
inspiring a new christianization for catholicisms third 
milennium and its estimated 860 million followers worldwide 
he reflected the churchs increasing emphasis on young people as 
protagonists in an effort to turn back secularization john paul 
urged young people to hold christian values rather than seeking 
economic success power or sexual gratification 
the popes message seemed popular with the crowd at gozo 
mountain which ranged from parish groups to conservative 
politicalreligious organizations to students trying to strengthen 
their religion 
he tells it like it is said mary sheehan 23 of washington 
vatican officials were trying to contact lebanese leaders to 
press john pauls peace effort but there were no announcements 
sunday about the popes earlier offer to visit lebanon 
more than 750 people have been killed since fighting broke out 
between the syrianled fighters and christian troops in march 
the pontiffs trip is his third to spain and the 43rd foreign 
voyage of his 11year papacy

cicippio and another american threatened to kill the hostages if the 
french navy intervenes in lebanon 
to prevent foreign intervention a lever in the hands of 
lebanons moslem combatants was the susceptibility of western 
governments visavis the hostage issue the abrar newspaper said 
in an editorial 
the progovernment daily assured the lebanese moslems that their 
struggle would culminate in the establishment of a state based 
on their will as the countrys majority according to irna

are shiite moslems lebanons largest single sect seeking to 
create an iranianstyle islamic republic to replace the 
christiandominated system 
iran has denied it has any direct control over the fate of the 
hostages 
urging the west against involvement in lebanons politics abrar 
referred to the 1983 attacks by shiite zealots against the french 
and american military units in beirut which killed nearly 300 
troops and led to the withdrawal of the multinational peacekeeping 
force from lebanon a few months later 
irna said the iranian newspaper described the withdrawal of the 
peacekeepers from lebanon as the escape of the american and french 
forces 
on sunday the revolutionary justice organization threatened to 
kill cicippio and edward austin tracy if there is intervention by 
france which dispatched two warships to the eastern mediterranean 
reportedly to evacuate 7000 french nationals from warbattered 
lebanon if the need arises 
america which is spurring france should realize that any 
foolhardiness by the french fleet will expose the life of its 
hostages to danger the shiite moslem group said in a statement

god have said france may be preparing for a military intervention 
to help christian forces who are fighting with the syrian army and 
its moslem allies

months 
at peak operation largo plans to make five to eight movies a 
year with budgets mirroring those of the major studios about 20

bethlehem mayor elias freij said today he has 
filed a complaint with israeli authorities over the alleged killing 
of a palestinian in the city by security officers disguised as 
tourists 
freij said in a telephone interview that the shooting incident 
saturday allegedly involving disguised officers is a very serious 
incident and i think the government is required to give an 
explanation 
the action he said could have a chilling effect on tourism in 
the holy land which already has been badly affected by the 20month 
uprising 
there were conflicting reports on the incident in bethlehems 
central market near the church of the nativity that marks the 
traditional location of jesus birth 
freij said bethlehem residents who witnessed the incident said 
two men and two women wearing backpacks and carrying cameras 
opened fire on demonstrators in the market killing radi mahmoud 
salah 18 
an army spokesman said soldiers opened fire after they were 
attacked with stones and that four palestinians were wounded 
the spokesman who cannot be identified under military rules 
said the army was unable to locate any body or to confirm reports 
that a palestinian had died 
a spokeswoman declined comment on the allegation that security 
forces posed as tourists 
doctors at king david hospital in bethlehem said salah was 
fatally shot in the chest 
as arabs we welcome tourists freij said it is our 
national duty to provide them with the best services but when 
elements with guns try to disguise themelves as tourists and kill 
people it could create suspicion among the arab community over who 
is a genuine tourist 
at least 540 palestinians have been shot and killed by israelis 
since the start of the uprising against israeli rule ninetyseven 
palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs and 38 israelis also 
have died 
freij noted israeli security forces have disguised themselves in 
the past in some cases by putting press signs on their cars but 
that this was the first reported incident in which they pretended to 
be tourists 
also today both the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
were shut down by a general strike called to protest an arson 
attempt on jersalems al aqsa mosque two decades ago hospital 
officials said troops wounded three palestinian children in a clash 
on the west bank 
shops and schools were closed and public and private 
transportation ground to a halt according to arab reports 
al aqsa mosque islams thirdholiest site was set ablaze aug 
21 1969 by a christian fundamentalist from australia who later was 
judged insane and deported to australia experts have spent years 
restoring the shrine and the work is still incomplete 
clashes erupted today between soldiers and stonethrowing 
palestinians in the tulkarem refugee camp and three children 
suffered gunshot wounds arab hospital officials said

attorney general dick thornburgh said the 
united states should consider offering military help to the 
colombian government in its fight against drug terrorism but the 
chairman of the senate judiciary committee opposed the use of troops 
i think we have to look at any request that we get for either 
law enforcement or military assistance seriously thornburgh said 
sunday on nbctvs meet the press 
you now see an aura of terrorism rather than simply 
narcotrafficking he said the assassination of a presidential 
candidate of the chief of police in medellin of other judges and 
top officials have really brought that country to its knees as far 
as enforcing its own laws is concerned 
i dont think we ought to respond as some suggest willynilly 
with a military response thornburgh said but i do think thats 
an option that we have to keep open 
sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the judiciary committee 
said today he would support sending some type of american police 
force to assist in colombia but he would draw the line at sending 
in us troops 
there should be absolutely no safe haven for these 
narcoterrorists and we know where they are most of the time 
biden said on nbcs today show 
the idea of sending down marines en masse to invade colombia at 
the invitation of the colombian government i cannot see biden 
said the idea of sending down if you will the international 
version of swat teams to help train and be part of operations to try 
to arrest to spirit these people away and bring them back to the 
united states for trial i can see 
the comments by thornburgh and biden followed a statement 
saturday by president bush that he was ready to meet with colombian 
president virgilio barco at the earliest convenient moment to 
consider a coordinated approach to the drug problem 
barco said friday he was using emergency powers to reinstate an 
extradition treaty with the united states so that colombian drug 
traffickers may be tried on drug charges originating in this country 
barco issued the order after sen luis carlos galan a leading 
presidential candidate was killed in a shotgun attack that police 
blamed on drug lords at least 10 other people were wounded in the 
attack 
the latest violence which also included the killing of a 
provincial police chief friday also led to the arrest of nearly 
10000 suspected drug criminals sunday in colombia 
the numbers of the major kingpins were looking at for 
extradition are a dozen or so thornburgh said sunday 
if in colombia they feel hypothetically that they may have 
reached the point where they can no longer operate under the rule of 
law and have to use the rule of force then theyre going to require 
all the help they need thornburgh said 
weve begun discussions with the state department and with the 
united states attorneys who are handling these particular cases so 
we will be in a position to act when any one or more we hope of 
these major cartel traffickers are taken into custody in colombia 
he said 
in another television interview today thornburgh said bushs 
drug strategy scheduled to be announced sept 5 will be directed 
to making the user of drugs far more accountable than we have in the 
past 
every cocaine sniffer or crack smoker in this country bears 
some responsibility for the assassinations that took place in 
colombia just as they bear responsibility for the crossfire that 
occurs in our streets here in the united states the attorney 
general said on cbs this morning 
without the demand for drugs here in the united states there 
would be no drug traffickers there would be no violence there 
would be no concern that has now become worldwide 
thornburgh also contended on meet the press that federal 
investigators have the right to examine the telephone records of 
reporters in an effort to find the source of leaked information from 
government sources 
thornburgh said investigators would be well within 
constitutional bounds if they sought reporters telephone records 
however he added im not going to comment on any particulars 
of any investigation 
thornburgh has ordered an investigation into leaks surrounding 
us rep william gray dpa shortly before he was elected house 
democratic whip gray was interviewed by fbi agents on memorial day 
triggering reports he was under investigation 
the justice department later said gray was not the subject of an 
investigation

egyptian president hosni mubarak today 
told african leaders beginning a fourday summit that the two main 
guerrillabacked groups in south africa should unite in their effort 
to end white rule 
mubarak chairman of the organization of african unity 
challenged the guerrillabacked african national congress and the 
rival pan africanist congress of south africa to become one 
liberation organization 
we stand ready to bring together both organizations in 
conditions acceptable to their leaders he told the oaus ad hoc 
committee on southern africa 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said 
mubarak was seeking agreement on a common african policy toward 
south africa possibly modifying some radical demands by the 
liberation movements as preconditions for talks with the pretoria 
government 
todays summit was scheduled to discuss proposals for a new 
approach to south africas racial policies from the two movements 
but no details of the written proposals have been released 
seven heads of state of the 13 african leaders normally 
represented on the committee attended the opening session in harare 
zimbabwes president robert mugabe said the leaders of south 
africas voteless black majority were ready to engage in serious 
negotiations with the whitedominated government 
but they and the people of free africa must be convinced that 
the regime is serious about wanting to negotiate mugabe said 
mugabe said mediation efforts to end conflicts in the 
blackgoverned former portuguese colonies of angola and mozambique 
had made positive progress 
but because of very difficult and delicate conditions these 
initiatives needed more backing from the 50member oau and other 
world nations the zimbabwean leader said 
the african national congress the main guerrilla organization 
fighting in south africa has in the past resisted calls for it to 
merge with the pan africanist congress to end long standing 
antagonism between the two groups 
both groups use armed resistance against the whiteled 
government however the pan africanist congress favors black 
selfreliance in the struggle for political rights while the anc 
supports a multiracial approach 
speaking for south african liberation movements president 
zephania mothopeng of the pan africanist congress said limited 
dialogue so far between south africas 26 million blacks and 6 
million whites who hold political power led only to cosmetic 
changes to apartheid 
at present that type of negotiation is out he said 
the summit also was expected to consider a proposed un 
resolution setting a framework for a south african settlement 
initiative along the lines that guided unsupervised independence 
elections in namibia scheduled for november 
some oau leaders are opposed to that idea believing it would 
minimize africas role in any settlement plan diplomats said 
the 16member ad hoc committee chaired by mubarak comprises 
algeria angola botswana cape verde congo egypt ethiopia mali 
mozambique nigeria tanzania zambia zimbabwe the african 
national congress the pan africanist congress and the southwest 
africa peoples organization of namibia 
on tuesday the eightnation special peace committee on angola 
will review efforts toward peace in that territory 
a summit of heads of five portuguesespeaking african states 
convenes on wednesday and the leaders of a ninenation economic 
grouping of southern african nations meets thursday in harare

several strong earthquakes shook 
ethiopia and caused some damage in neighboring djibouti officials 
said today 
there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties in 
ethiopia 
the first temblor registered 64 on the richter scale and 
occurred at 217 pm sunday about 320 miles northeast of addis 
ababa and 100 miles northwest of djibouti 
subsequent quakes registering up to 65 on the openended scale 
struck the same area today at 348 am 409 am and 450 am 
said dr gebreberhan equbaegzi of the university of ethiopias 
geology department 
the department is responsible for measuring seismic activity in 
ethiopia but gebreberhan said the quakes were too strong and too 
near to be assessed by their equipment 
the us geological survey in golden colorado said the second 
temblor this morning measured 65 on the richter scale 
in djibouti the geophysical observatory reported that although 
the quake epicenter was in ethiopia minor property damage was 
reported in the town of yoboki about 62 miles west of the capital 
and close to the ethiopian border no injuries were reported 
gebreberhan estimated the worst affected area in ethiopia would 
be in the province of wollo between dubti and serdo where the 
government runs five large commercial farms the area is sparsely 
populated and its flat dry landscape is dotted with occassional 
mountains 
a source at the ministry of state farm development said it did 
not yet have any reports from the farms but the highway to the port 
of assab had been blocked by rocks thrown off a mountain about 370 
miles northeast of addis ababa 
in 1961 an earthquake of similar severity hit the same region 
causing several buildings to collapse in karakore near serdo and 
dubti

thermal stress when cold water hit a hot 
pressurized steam pipe under manhattan may have caused a colossal 
blowup of steam and mud that killed three people a utility 
spokesman said 
the steam is going through at such a high pressure that 
anything might have affected the integrity of the pipe and caused it 
to break consolidated edison spokesman marty gitten said sunday 
the cold water could have come from the leaking water main that 
was under repair when the explosion occurred or from a nearby fire 
hydrant gitten said but it may be months before investigators know 
for sure 
its not unlike putting together a puzzle after an airline 
crash we have to literally put the pieces of damaged pipe back 
together and recreate the scene gitten said 
the blast from the 24inch steam pipe saturday night ripped open 
a manhattan street and sprayed steam and mud as high as 15 stories 
the steam is piped to buildings who use it for heating and 
sometimes to run machinery the utility has about 2000 steam 
customers in lower manhattan gitten said 
a woman sleeping in her thirdfloor apartment and a consolidated 
edison worker were killed in the blast a second con ed worker who 
was burned died overnight authorities said at least 18 other 
people were injured one critically and hundreds of people were 
evacuated from damaged apartments 
the pipe exploded as four con ed workers were opening one of its 
valves to restore the pipe to service gitten said it had been 
turned off as a precaution early saturday as the city repaired a 
water leak on the same block 
when the pipe ripped open it blasted chunks of asphalt rocks 
and mud over a oneblock area 
i actually saw the street rise said tom ritchford 27 who 
was with denise ozker 29 in a sidewalk cafe when the street blew 
open a few feet away when it came up i covered my face and 
stepped under the table and pulled denise under the table with me

about 1400 more east germans escaped 
to west germany over the weekend in the largest such flight since 
the hungarian uprising was crushed in 1956 officials said today 
the latest batch of refugees included 980 east germans who 
crossed illegally into austria from hungary according to austrian 
officials 
in west germany a spokesman for chancellor helmut kohl said 
hardline leaders of east germany could solve the problem by 
instituting reforms 
we would like to see the east german leadership move in the 
same direction of reform as their neighboring communist states 
hans klein said 
the opposition social democratic party made a similar appeal to 
east german leaders 
at least 500 of the refugees slipped through a border gate 
between hungary and austria that had been opened saturday for an 
event celebrating european unity 
austrian authorities said the weekend surge into their country 
was the largest outpouring they had seen since soviet troops put 
down the antistalinist uprising in hungary 
more than 10000 east germans have made their way to west germany 
in august according to manfred kersten a spokesman for a west 
german resettlement camp in giessen he said about 1400 more east 
germans arrived at the camp over the weekend 
the camp about 30 miles north of frankfurt has become so 
crowded in recent weeks that west germany has converted a military 
barracks near muenster for the overflow 
kohl returned to bonn today after a threeweek vacation in 
austria and immediately took up the refugee issue klein said he 
said kohl was expected to announce plans for dealing with the 
problem on tuesday 
the exodus of east germans is the largest since the berlin wall 
was built in 1961 more than 65000 east germans are estimated to 
have escaped or legally emigrated to west germany this year 
officials of the intergerman affairs ministry say they expect up 
to 100000 east germans to arrive in west germany this year 
many of the east germans who have fled to west germany recently 
have said they left because they saw little hope of social or 
economic reform at home 
the problem worsened after hungary took down fences at the 
austrian border in may leading to a crush of east germans crossing 
there 
the many east german refugees have overwhelmed west german 
diplomats who have closed their missions in east berlin and 
budapest 
representatives of east germany west germany and hungary have 
tried to find a solution east berlin authorities have accused west 
germany of encouraging the escapes 
west germanys ambassador to vienna dieter graf von bruehl told 
austrian tv that 660 east germans were taken in by the embassy on 
saturday and that another 160 had come to the embassy on sunday 
officials in the austrian border town of moerbisch reported that 
another 160 east germans crossed sunday night

conservationist george adamson was slain by 
bandits near the wildlife reserve where he and his late wife born 
free author joy adamson taught lions raised in captivity to live 
in the wild 
adamson 83 was killed sunday as he drove head on into a group 
of somali bandits who had robbed and beat his assistants shifta or 
roaming bands of somali tribesmen are believed responsible for most 
of the animal poaching in kenya 
adamson and his wife together helped popularize wildlife 
conservation joy adamson was killed in 1980 by a young servant in a 
wage dispute 
after hearing gunfire adamson and three workers drove about a 
mile from the kora national reserve to help the assistants director 
of wildlife richard leakey said today at a news conference leakey 
went to kora to investigate the incident 
arriving at the scene of the attack adamson ignored pleas to 
stop from other occupants in his car put his foot on the gas and 
drove straight at the bandits leakey said adamson and two of his 
assistants in his car died in the barrage 
george was a brave man leakey said at a news conference 
he said about 150 security personnel had been deployed in the 
region since the attack and an area an 80mile radius from adamsons 
camp had been cordoned off 
we intend to find the attackers and bring them to justice 
said leakey 
he said the government had been increasingly concerned about 
attacks by shifta since a major antipoaching effort pushed most of 
them out of kenyas game reserves 
however adamson refused any additional protection and did not 
want to be removed from kora where he felt well protected by his 16 
lions and more than half a dozen assistants leakey said 
it was due largely to activism by adamson who moved to kora and 
leased the area from a county council in 1971 that the government 
made it a game reserve three years later 
as a result of encroachment by nomadic somali tribesmen and their 
herds adamson pressured kenya into calling in paramilitary 
antipoaching troops to drive out the somalis 
in an interview with the associated press in 1983 adamson said 
he had been told of a plot by somalis to murder him in the hope that 
with him gone authorities would be under little pressure to police 
the reserve 
i think that george always was aware that that was a risk and 
that he was treading on somebodys toes said one of adamsons 
close associates 
adamson was game warden of kenyas northern frontier district in 
1944 when he married joy an austrianborn artist whose books would 
thrust him into fame 
after living apart from her husband joy moved to the game 
reserve in the late 1960s to work with leopards 
in 1956 her husband brought home three motherless lion cubs 
one which they named elsa became the central character of born 
free adamson served as technical director for a film adaptation 
that book and its sequels living free and forever free 
described the adamsons unique and controversial practice of taking 
lions born in captivity and teaching them to survive on their own 
before freeing them 
the government stopped the practice in 1980 after a mauling 
incident in kora in 1980 
adamson whose shoulderlength hair and goatee gave him a 
lionlike appearance kept a modest camp in kora and lived off a 
pension interest from a trust fund set up by his wife and 
donations from supporters 
he wrote two books of his own bwana game and an 
autobiography my pride and joy 
adamson was born in india in 1906 and first visited kenya in 
1924 he later moved to the east african nation and joined its game 
department in 1938 he retired as game warden in 1963 
he had no children

film producer toby halicki who won a cult 
following with carcrash movies was killed when a water tower fell 
prematurely during preparations for a stunt that local officials 
initially had tried to prevent 
halicki 48 of gardena calif was killed sunday during filming 
for the movie gone in 60 seconds ii tonawanda police officer 
michael thorp said 
the collapse of the 141foot water tower apparently caused an 
attached cable to snap and knock over a telephone pole which fell 
on halicki thorp said 
an emergency medical technician and a nurse worked to save 
halicki but he was pronounced dead on arrival at kenmore mercy 
hospital thorp said halicki died of internal injuries 
halicki who also was directing and starring in the film had 
fought with local officials for two months for permission to topple 
the water tower located in an abandoned industrial park he was 
allowed to go ahead only after obtaining 8 million worth of 
insurance 
tonawanda town supervisor ronald moline had accused halicki of 
flying by the seat of his pants 
in an interview with the associated press just hours before his 
death halicki denied his stunts were unsafe and said he thought 
town officials were out to make my life as miserable as they 
could 
this morning moline called the accident a tragedy adding im 
not one of those types of people to take any satisfaction out of 
what happened like i told you so 
however he said one of the ironies of this situation is that 
perhaps the halicki family will benefit from some of these insurance 
coverages he took 
halicki a native of nearby dunkirk was born henry b halicki 
but was known as toby 
he returned to the area three months ago to shoot segments for 
the sequel to his 1974 cult movie gone in 60 seconds in which 
halicki played a car thief the title refers to the time it takes a 
professional thief to steal a car 
the movie was called a cinematic demolition derby and more of 
the same kind of action was planned for the sequel 
halicki was filming a sequence in which a tractortrailer was to 
slam its way through a series of cars before ramming the water tower 
the scene was set up in an abandoned industrial park on the 
buffalotonawanda line halicki said tonawanda officials originally 
turned him down when he requested to film the stunt 
he sent back a letter that said we dont want you in our 
town period halicki said referring to moline 
i wound up furnishing them with 8 million worth of insurance 
and a 10000 cash bond to make sure id clean up after the 
debris which i understand theyve never done to anyone and im 
looking to sue them when im done because i dont think they had 
the right to do this to me on private property 
in the scene a tractortrailer was to run into the base of the 
water tower and cables attached to trucks were to help pull down 
the structure one of those cables apparently snapped and knocked 
the telephone pole onto halicki 
during filming earlier sunday halicki frequently shouted 
warnings to the crew and observers to stay clear as car crashes 
and accompanying explosions took place everybody clear out 
he yelled at one point theres going to be a big explosion 
he said he no longer did many of the dangerous stunts in his 
movies explaining that a close call while shooting his 1982 junk 
man had made him more careful 
ive had some very close calls he said i had a headon 
collision with an airplane on my last film we hit at a combined 
speed of over 200 mph and we crashed the plane and put about 80 
stitches in my head i was very lucky 
halicki said you can always have chase sequences where things 
go wrong you have to be careful we finetune it a great deal but 
we have to work in a margin of safety 
as was the case in the original halicki had financed the 
production of gone in 60 seconds ii himself and said he was 
looking to have it released through a major studio

hungary has begun allowing soviet jews to fly 
to israel through budapest becoming the second east european 
country to permit the transit of such immigrants the world jewish 
congress said monday 
the hungarian decision is a harbinger of the establishment of 
full diplomatic ties between israel and hungary in the coming weeks 
and of direct flights between the soviet union and israel in the 
future said wjc sources 
establishment of hungary as a third transit point in addition to 
austria and romania is also expected to ease the processing of an 
increasing flow of jews being allowed to leave the soviet union 
under the liberalized policies of mikhail gorbachev 
the first group of soviet jews a couple with two children 
came through budapest last monday and small groups have been 
arriving from the soviet union every day since said the sources 
who spoke only on condition they not be further identified 
the recently opened office of the world jewish congress in 
budapest pays for the emigres overnight stay gives them an 
orientation talk and puts them on a direct flight to israel the next 
day said the sources direct flight from budapest to tel aviv on 
the two countries national carriers el al and hungarys malev 
began several months ago 
some 50000 people most of them jews are expected to emigrate 
from the soviet union this year about 80000 are projected for 1990 
and larger numbers in the following years more than 80 percent of 
the emigres go to the united states 
but an increasing number is going to israel as they get turned 
away from the united states because of a budget crunch that limits 
refugee slots and a massive backlog in the processing of immigration 
requests in moscow 
romania the only eastern european country that did not break off 
ties with israel after the 1967 arabisraeli war has been allowing 
soviet jews to transit through bucharest for several years 
hungary renewed ties with israel last year at the consular level 
and is expected to become the first east european country to renew 
full ties probably in the fall

a few dozen union protesters set out 
monday to demonstrate against the chafin coal co but quickly ran 
into a problem the company they discovered no longer exists 
undeterred the demonstrators wound up marching in a drenching 
rain outside a bank with ties to the defunct companys owner who 
was nowhere to be found 
the demonstrators from the united mine workers joined by about a 
dozen members of the communications workers of america were 
protesting what they charged were unfair labor practices by chafin 
the company they said ceased mining operations in order to lay 
off union mineworkers and then subleased the mines to other 
companies that hired nonunion workers 
the protesters arrived at the former headquarters of chafin coal 
at about 9 am but found the stone building abandoned and nothing 
but a boat trailer in the parking lot 
the demonstrators paraded singlefile in front of the building 
for a while but eventually tired of that and moved on to the chafin 
building in downtown huntington they were told the building is not 
affiliated with chafin coal 
the 30 or so protesters finally landed at guarantee national 
bank where chafins former president john chafin sr is on the 
board of directors 
there was no indication that chafin was at the bank or even in 
huntington calls to his home telephone went unanswered a telephone 
at the home of john chafin jr a company vice president had been 
disconnected 
guarantee national bank president mark sprouse was not in his 
office a secretary said and could not be reached for comment the 
secretary said she couldnt figure out why the bank was being 
picketed 
gary white president of the west virginia coal association said 
the chafin coal building first picketed was the last known address 
for the company he said he did not know what had happened to the 
company 
one of the demonstrators fred o hartman a roof bolter who has 
been out of work for two years insisted that chafin has opened new 
mines but hasnt called back union workers 
they say that theyre not open anymore but you call and every 
time they answer the phone they say chafin coal co hartman 
said sounds like they are open to me 
however callers trying to reach chafin coal on monday were told 
its telephone lines either have been disconnected or changed to 
unpublished numbers 
hartman said local union presidents held a meeting sunday night 
and decided on the chafin demonstration theyve subleased the 
coal out but john chafins still responsible for it hartman said

meat prices rose monday by an average of 
65 percent despite recent protest strikes by hundreds of thousands 
of workers the official mti news agency reported 
the staterun meat industry stood firm in its decision to 
increase prices although the government and the official trade union 
federation szot jointly appealed against the move mti said 
statecontrolled industries have a great deal of autonomy in 
hungary one of the most liberal soviet bloc countries and 
sometimes make decisions independent of the communist 
partycontrolled government 
imre mike meat industry general director told mti the joint 
appeal arrived at industry headquarters on friday too late to 
postpone the price increase the news agency did not specifiy 
whether the appeal would affect plans for a sept 4 price increase 
of 6 percent 
opposition to the price increases resulted in widespread work 
stoppages of up to one hour friday but mti said only about half of 
the 2 million people took part in the strike 
most of the strikers were steel workers while food industry and 
meat producers heeded an appeal by a newly established independent 
trade union federation and kept working said mti 
the meat industry has said the price increases were necessary 
because increased feed and fertilizer costs led to a drop in meat 
production

president bush will submit a 75 
billion to 8 billion antidrug package to congress next month that 
will include increased aid to latin american countries white house 
chief of staff john sununu said today 
however sununu said there are no plans to send us troops to 
colombia to fight the cocaine industry and that bush would be wary 
of doing so even if the south american nations president virgilio 
barco vargas requested such help 
there is a tradition in the western hemisphere a reluctance 
for anyone to ask for troops and a reluctance of the president to 
commit troops he told reporters after meeting with the 
vacationing bush 
on the subject of new threats to american hostages held by 
islamic militants in lebanon sununu said there had been no change 
in us policy 
we are not going to react to each new threat he said the 
policy remains unchanged the president underscored that the 
hostagetakers are responsible for the safety of all the hostages 
a proiranian group said sunday that it would consider killing 
two american hostages if the french navy intervenes in lebanon 
which has been plagued by civil war 
basically it is our policy not to try to increase attention on 
the hostages sununu said 
he added the french have made it clear they have no intention 
to intervene and that the ships are there merely to assist french 
nationals who want to leave 
bush will present details of his drug stratagy in a sept 5 
speech to the nation 
although there have been various reports on the price tag of the 
plan sununus reference to a cost of 75 billion to 8 billion 
marked the first time the administration has publicly offered a 
figure 
much of the money will be reprogrammed from other programs 
sununu said he said the main focus of the plan would be domestic 
although it would contain funds to help latin american countries 
fight drug traffic at the source 
but sununu backed away from comments made sunday by attorney 
general dick thornburgh that the administration should consider 
sending troops to colombia if invited 
he said the administration drug policy does not envision sending 
us troops to latin aerican country to fight drugs 
sununu said bush made most final decisions on the drug package 
today sending a series of directives back to budget director 
richard darman on where to siphon funds from other programs to help 
pay for the effort 
earlier bush spoke briefly with reporters on the golf course and 
said he had been briefed by sununu on the latest threat to us 
hostages and was leaving it to his staff chief to explain our 
position 
a proiranian extremist group believed to be holding american 
hostages joseph cicippio and edward austin tracy issued death 
threats sunday against the two men if french ships in the 
mediterranean intervene in lebanons civil war 
the statement by a shiite moslem group which calls itself the 
revolutionary justice organization was accompanied by a photocopy 
of a photograph of tracy the group released aug 1 
french officials said the ships were sent to be ready to evacuate 
7000 french nationals in lebanon if necessary but there was no 
intention of intervening in lebanon 
the president began his day today by taking a 21minute dawn jog 
near his familys seaside compound with his daughter dorothy 
leblond and three reporters

his wife survived 66 days at sea on raw fish and purified water 
after whales rammed and sank their pleasure boat off the central 
american coast 
william butler 59 and his 56yearold wife simone of miami 
were taken to a hospital in golfito costa rica after being rescued 
by a costa rican coast guard crew saturday about 20 miles off that 
citys pacific coast butler said 
the butlers were sailing their 40foot boat the siboney from 
coral gables fla near miami to honolulu hawaii for a vacation 
according to us coast guard spokesman egbert vallecillo 
they left panama to start the pacific leg of their journey on may 
24 butler said in an interview today 
on june 15 a group of whales attacked the boat he said 
in no more than 15 minutes our boat was destroyed he said 
by telephone from the hospital but god always present in our 
prayers helped us because we carried a life raft and we got in it 
immediately taking all the things we would need 
he said they had eight cans of food some cookies a water 
purifier and a fishing hook 
but after 20 days adrift all the food was gone after that we 
started fishing thanks to god we were lucky and all the time we 
had food and with the filter we drank good water 
butler shed 49 of his 175 pounds and his wife went from 150 
pounds to 92 he said he said 
they are weak but they are expected to recover said 
vallecillo who spoke to butler by telephone from the us coast 
guards pacific command headquarters in alameda 10 miles east of 
san francisco 
butler told coast guard officials their boat was attacked and 
sunk by several whales about 1200 miles southwest of costa rica 
they were large according to mr butler but he didnt know 
how many whales vallecillo said 
butler told coast guard officials he is an experienced sailor 
vallecillo said he has heard of boats running into marine mammals 
when visibility is poor but he wasnt sure if there have been any 
recorded cases of whale aggression 
the couples last radio contact was june 13 when they talked to 
their daughter susan smith in miami 
this is an execeptional case in that they were prepared with 
fishing equipment and the desalinization unit vallecillo said 
during the two months adrift the lifeboat moved slowly eastward 
the butlers caught between 400 and 500 pounds of fish and survived 
multiple shark attacks by sealing punctures with a raft repair kit 
vallecillo said 
butler told us coast guard officials that several times they 
spotted merchant ships but were unable to flag them down 
on saturday the costa rican ship finally saw the raft and 
rescued the couple

east german leader erich honecker has been 
hospitalized again following surgery to remove gallstones it was 
reported monday 
honecker who will be 77 on friday was also hospitalized last 
month for treatment of health problems related to gallstones that 
illness forced him to leave the warsaw pact summit in bucharest on 
july 8 before its conclusion 
the official news agency adn said the communist party leader was 
on the road to recovery after an operation to remove gallstones 
last week but provided no other details of honeckers condition 
honecker appeared in public last week for the first time in more 
than a month looking relatively fit his absence had fueled rumors 
he was in poor health 
although neighboring hungary and poland have instituted broad 
democratic reforms of the type championed by soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev honeckers leadership has made clear that it plans no 
major change in the communist partys monopoly on power 
that stance by the east berlin leadership has disenchanted many 
east germans and prompted a recent exodus to west germany

police bans today and rallied on the 21st anniversary of the 
sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia to call for the kind of 
reforms the invasion crushed

hungary the neighboring communist country has embarked on the 
kind of political reforms czechoslovakias entrenched leaders have 
rejected

started 
at least a handful of people were seen being detained in the 
melee and helmeted riot police moved in force into wenceslas 
square the halfmile long boulevard in central prague where the 
rally began 
many tourists were watching the demonstration on the square and 
some of them applauded when shouts of freedom were heard 
warsaw pact tanks rolled into czechoslovakia on aug 21 1968 
choking the prague spring reforms of alexander dubcek the 
communist party leader who was ousted in 1969 and expelled from the 
party in 1970 he is today a pensioner in bratislava but has issued 
increasingly strong calls for reform to resume 
on sunday more than 30 young people were led to a police bus 
after trying to march in central prague as they have every day since 
aug 1 dozens of police patrols roamed the city checking the 
documents of passersby at least one western photographer was 
forced to hand over film to police

invasion anniversary shouting demands for freedom dubcek and the 
withdrawal of soviet troops 
in the past year thousands of czechoslovaks have signed 
petitions demanding dialogue with communist authorities and reforms 
such as those in neighboring poland hungary and the soviet union 
but the communist leaders who were put in power by moscow after 
the 1968 invasion have so far refused to institute political change 
the question of political power was decisively settled here 
forever in 1948 the year of the communist takeover karel 
urbanek a politburo member said saturday 
poland and hungary which are experimenting with democratic 
reform have condemned the invasion in recent weeks on sunday 
hungarian premier miklos nemeth said his government also condemned 
hungarys participation in the invasion

two space shuttles were on the move 
monday with columbia returning from california where it ended a 
mission and atlantis joining with rockets that will boost it toward 
orbit in october 
columbia came back to its launch base bolted atop a boeing 747 
jetliner that was forced to make an overnight stop in georgia 
because of thunderstorms 
the 747 left edwards air force base calif early sunday and 
made a refueling stop in texas before being diverted to robins air 
base ga late in the day bad weather in the southwest had delayed 
by 24 hours a planned saturday departure from edwards 
columbia landed in californias mojave desert on aug 13 after a 
fiveday secret military mission which reportedly included 
deployment of a spy satellite and experiments related to the star 
wars antimissile program 
atlantis which completed a flight in may was towed out of a 
processing hangar into an assembly building monday to be mated with 
an external fuel tank and two solid fuel rockets for an oct 12 
launch 
atlantis fivemember crew is to start the galileo spacecraft on 
a sixyear journey to orbit the planet jupiter and drop a probe into 
its atmosphere 
columbia the oldest space shuttle now will be readied for a 
10day december mission during which the crew of five is to release 
a communications satellite and attempt to retrieve a science 
satellite the size of a school bus 
the science satellite called ldef for long duration exposure 
facility was launched from another shuttle in 1984 and was to have 
been retrieved a year later but delays followed by the 1986 
explosion of the shuttle challenger held up the recovery mission 
unusually high solar activity is expanding the atmosphere and 
increasing drag on ldef raising the possibility it might reenter 
the atmosphere and burn up destroying valuable experiments before 
columbias crew can salvage it as a result nasa is considering an 
earlier launch for the mission 
in between the columbia and atlantis flights discovery is to 
take off in november on another classified defense department 
mission

salvage crews today searched for bodies in the 
river thames and in a pleasure boat that sank in a latenight 
collision with a barge police said 25 people were killed and 38 
others unaccounted for 
eightyseven people survived the accident early sunday under 
southwark bridge in the heart of london police said a scotland 
yard statement revised an earlier death toll of 27 to 25 
the tragedy occurred aboard the privately chartered marchioness 
which had set out on a birthday cruise for 26yearold businessman 
antonio vasconcellos he is among the missing 
the scotland yard statement said the bodies were in a mortuary 
undergoing postmortems and an inquest would open wednesday police 
said 25 launches were scouring the thames for bodies 
police detained the captain and second mate of the bowbelle 
sandandgravel dredger and released them overnight police said 
they would be questioned again today 
we are looking at offenses such as possible unlawful killing 
and any related offenses said a police spokeswoman on condition 
of anonymity unlawful killing is a british charge similar to 
manslaughter 
authorities also examined taped radio messages to river 
navigators for clues into the cause of the accident 
the independent a london daily reported an apparent 
disagreement between the captains of the 90ton marchioness and the 
1475ton bowbelle over which vessel should pass first under the 
bridges central span 
the paper also quoted a veteran crewman as saying the bowbelle 
rammed another thames passenger boat five years ago and nearly sank 
it the thames is one of the worlds busiest commercial rivers used 
by more than 32000 vessels each year 
as the tide dropped today the hull of the 85foot marchioness 
became fully visible resting on a mudbank with its top deck sheared 
off and its dance floor exposed crews had pulled the boat there 
from the center of the river where it sank 
one launch brought families of some victims to the scene to drop 
flowers on the water 
police said sunday that the boat which did not have a passenger 
roster was licensed to carry 149 passengers and two crew they said 
the death toll could be up to 60 
the marchioness sank within minutes and carried underwater scores 
of revelers who were drinking and dancing below deck 
british journalist nicholas hastings who was attending the 
party survived the sinking 
suddenly there was a small jolt somebody screamed he said 
the first thing that ran through my mind was that we had hit 
something in the river but as i turned around i could see the 
emormous looming hull of the dredger that had hit us it was right 
on top of us 
among the missing too was the riverboat captain the partygoers 
many in their teens and twenties included friends of the 
portugueseborn vasconcellos and figures from the worlds of 
modeling photography and finance 
transport secretary cecil parkinson cut short a florida vacation 
and returned to london today to head the investigation 
the independent quoting unidentified river authority sources 
said the last radio conversation between the captains was a 
discussion as to which should pass through the central span of 
southwark bridge it appears there may have been a 
disagreement 
only vessels as big as the 260foot bowbelle one of the largest 
registered on the thames have right of way through the central 
arches of the rivers bridges and pleasure craft should keep to the 
second or third arches near the bank the newspaper said quoting a 
port of london authority source 
pleasure craft are bloody awful on the river they continually 
cut corners to save a few minutes it quoted the unidentified 
source as saying 
it also quoted a former river boat engineer gerald hastings as 
saying he was on the pride of greenwich when the bowbelle rammed it 
from behind under charing cross bridge in 1984 
the collision left a 3foot dent in the stern and an inquiry 
equally apportioned blame the newspaper said 
we got no message from the bowbelle hastings was quoted as 
saying i believe that they did not have a lookout when they hit 
us 
in 1878 the paddlesteamer princess alice was sliced in two by a 
coal barge on the thames in southeast london it sank within five 
minutes killing an estimated 700 people

bush administration budget officials said today 
that the federal deficit is on a path that if not corrected would 
require 162 billion in automatic spending cuts during the fiscal 
year that begins oct 1 
however richard g darman director of the office of management 
and budget said the automatic cuts can be avoided if congress fully 
implements a budget agreement reached with the administration in 
april 
it remains my hope and my cautiously optimistic expectation 
that necessary legislation may be enacted prior to oct 1 that 
would cut the deficit to the maximum 100 billion level specified by 
the grammrudman balancedbudget law darman said in a letter to 
president bush 
darman expressed that hope as his office made public a report 
gauging progress made in reducing the deficit we are cutting it 
very close he said 
that report projects a deficit of 1162 billion in the 1990 
fiscal year the grammrudman law limits the deficit to 100 billion 
in that year but allows a 10 billion cushion before requiring 
acrosstheboard spending cuts however once spending cuts are 
triggered the full 162 billion reduction would be required 
those automatic cuts known in washington jargon as 
sequestration would require a 53 percent reduction in most 
nondefense spending but not social security benefits for example 
and a 43 percent cut in military spending 
the omb report spelled out in detail how programs might be 
affected by the arbitrary cuts 
for example it said cuts could undermine the ability of the 
drug enforcement administration to fight illegal drugs 
significantly hamper efforts by the public health service to prevent 
the spread of aids require furlough of federal aviation 
administration personnel for three days a month and reduce grants 
for needy college students by 1 billion below the level recommended 
by the department of education 
the omb forecast is based on economic projections that are more 
optimistic than those used by the congressional budget office cbo 
said last week that deficitreduction efforts enacted so far would 
leave 1415 billion of red ink in 1990 25 billion above the omb 
estimate 
most of that gap is accounted for by the differing assumptions 
about economic growth and inflation plus technical differences on 
how the recently enacted bailout for the savings and loan industry 
will be implemented

beiruts battered horse track frequented 
by christans and moslems is one of the few signs of unity in a 
nation wracked by bloodshed 
oldtimers say that when the milelong circular track goes it 
will mean the end of lebanon as a state 
the racetrack which is called the palace of peace and sits in 
the nomans land along beiruts dividing green line was until 
recently still used for occasional private race meetings 
in the summer of 1988 which was relatively quiet there were 
racing sessions every fortnight with up to 1 million being 
wagered that encouraged the track committee to repair the 
wardamaged gates stands and betting counters and set march 13 
this year for reopening it to the public 
but five days before the scheduled opening fighting erupted 
between christian troops and the syrian army the track came under 
fierce bombardment trapping 40 arabian horses in their stables 
for nine days trainers and stable hands tried in vain to reach 
them from both sides of the green line that splits beirut into 
moslem and christian sectors 
when we finally made it we found two horses fatally wounded by 
shrapnel and six dead in their boxes from thirst and hunger said 
trainer sami dabbour a moslem 
he said the other 32 horses were barely able to stand when 
rescuers got to them during a lull last week 
we fed them and watered them and then got them out to safer 
stables in west beirut i have 10 in my stables and theyre doing 
fine now dabbour added 
nearly 500 other arabian horses worth an estimated 2 million 
were brought out during previous lulls 
in the old days up to 10000 people used to gather at the track 
founded in 1916 during ottoman rule every weekend for races 
politics were never discussed 
when the civil war broke out in april 1975 the track and its 
stands were seriously damaged and it was closed for two years 
it was reopened in 1977 after the syrian army intervened to 
snuff out the fighting even though snipers from both sides still 
fired from shellpocked apartment buildings overlooking the track 
the first race that year was won by a white arabian named simsam 
arabic for sword its neck in bandages because of a gunshot 
wounded 
his moslem owner azmi ghazi was hugged and kissed by jubilant 
christians who had bet on his horse 
the track repeatedly was caught in the crossfire after that in 
1979 when it was open for a while gunmen opened up on the horses 
lined up for the christmas prize race then raked the crowded 
stands wounding three spectators 
when the israeli army invaded lebanon in 1982 120 horses were 
killed and most of the surrounfing pine woods set on fire in the 
fighting 
races resumed late in 1983 at the new years day race in 1984 
one horse collapsed on the course bringing down the four favorites 
a 921 longshot named commodore romped home causing an uproar 
the committee canceled the result one man who had bet heavily 
on commodore stormed off shouting threats minutes later a 
rocketpropelled grenade hit the committees glassedin 
airconditioned tower no one was hurt 
on feb 21 1985 a militia commander fired three grenades in the 
air over the stands because the committee refused to pay protection 
money

solidarity chief lech walesa today warned 
the communist party to moderate its demands for more seats in the 
new solidarityled cabinet or it will lose everything 
the communist party central committee in a resolution published 
late sunday said it should be given an amount of seats in the 
government of prime ministerdesignate tadeusz mazowiecki that 
correspond to its state and political potential 
while not mentioning a specific number it was clear from the 
resolution that the party wants more than just the defense and 
interior portfolios offered so far by solidarity 
they should not fight for keeping their posts anymore walesa 
said today in an interview with the associated press in gdansk he 
urged the party to understand what these times mean 
if they play the fool they can lose even more they will be 
rejected he said 
the solidarity chairman said mazowiecki might offer additional 
seats to the communists because the government will need wise 
people but he said the movement would not buckle if the party 
tried to take those offices by force 
we need reforms if the party does not understand that and 
starts provocations and only provoking and they are now then it 
will lose everything walesa said 
in an interview in the party newspaper trybuna ludu first 
secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski said he is looking for ways to 
strengthen the powers of the party 
hundreds of thousands of our comrades are waiting today all 
over poland for the voice of their central committee on the issues 
most significant not only for the party but for the whole 
country rakowski said 
do we capitulate or charge forward do we resign from the 
values of socialism or are we ready to defend them he said 
journalist daniel passent editor of rakowskis former 
partylinked newspaper polityka said in an interview today with the 
british broadcasting corp that the party probably would ask for the 
powerful ministries of foreign affairs and finance in addition ot 
defense and internal affairs 
mazowiecki said in gdansk sunday he has made no final decision on 
the makeup of his government but that it would be open to reform 
forces from all parties 
president wojciech jaruzelski issued an announcement saturday 
that he intended to nominate mazowiecki a longtime solidarity 
journalist and adviser to lech walesa to head the east blocs first 
noncommunist government 
a spokeswoman for sejm speaker mikolaj kozakiewicz confirmed 
today that the sejm has received jaruzelskis nominating letter the 
appointment of mazowiecki would be added to wednesdays agenda of 
the sejm the lower parliament chamber the spokeswoman said 
he said a central committee resolution in which it threatened to 
withhold support from the government if it does not receive enough 
cabinet seats answers the expectations of the part of the party 
which does not want to put up their hands in surrender 
the communist central committee demanded in a resolution 
published late sunday that it be given an amount of seats in the 
mazowiecki government that correspond to its state and political 
potential 
otherwise we will not be able to take responsibility for the 
course of developments the party said in the resolution adopted 
at its meeting saturday and released by the state pap news service 
our support for the new government is conditioned on reaching 
agreement on its program platform and political structure it 
said it said it also wanted the assurances before mazowieckis 
appointment 
solidarity the united peasant party and the democratic party 
have enough votes in parliament to elect mazowiecki even without 
communist support but deciding how to handle the partys objections 
will be the first delicate problem of his government 
the party resolution was critical of the peasants and democrats 
for switching allegiance to the solidarity candidate and accused 
solidarity of breaking the springs roundtable accords which 
did not anticipate such a rapid switchover in power 
it said neither of the countrys main political forces the 
communists or solidarity can independently or even more 
against one another face the dangers and pull the country out of 
collapse 
to its former coalition partners the party said they might 
bear the burden of historical responsibility for switching 
allegiances to solidarity 
mazowiecki in the baltic port of gdansk on sunday for his first 
public rally since being nominated met with solidarity chief lech 
walesa and other leaders of the independent movement to begin 
planning the government 
mazowiecki expects to decide by the end of the month how the 
government ministries will be divided among solidarity two newly 
allied minor parties and the communists his acting spokesman said 
to lift up the country you need a broad government formula 
a government open to all forces represented in parliament 
mazowiecki said in an interview for publication today in the 
oppositions gazeta wyborcza newspaper 
but as to which party would get which ministries in his cabinet 
he said he has not decided i cannot act hastily he told the 
paper

thirtytwo alligators were killed 
and left to rot on the west side of lake okeechobee in what may have 
been a vendetta against a state game officer wildlife officials say 
poaching was not the motive because the reptiles valuable hides 
and tails containing choice meat were left intact they say 
no arrests have been made in the gator killings a thirddegree 
felony punishable by up to five years in jail and a 5000 fine 
except during brief special hunting seasons only wildlife officers 
and the states 46 licensed nuisancealligator trappers are 
authorized to kill the animals in the wild 
capt james r doxey of the florida game and fresh water fish 
commission said the shooting spree two weeks ago may have been a 
result of someones anger over a poaching arrest because at least 
one clue was left 
one gator was dangling from a pole and spraypainted on its 
carcass was the name of a wildlife officer who patrols the 
700000acre lake 
wildlife officers occasionally find one or two gators shot but 
never on a scale like this said lindsey hord the game 
commissions south florida alligator program coordinator 
it was just wanton destruction there is absolutely no 
justification for shooting that many gators he said 
alligators generally steer clear of humans but there have been 
several instances of them attacking and killing or wounding people 
despite that danger wildlife officers say they still run across 
evidence of gator abuse not necessarily related to poaching 
including bulletriddled carcasses floating in canals and live 
gators swimming around with protruding darts or arrows 
mike rafferty a nuisance gator trapper in palm city said he has 
seen people with guns using gators for target practice 
alligators are not an attractive species to most people they 
are not furry when they are young said mike jennings an 
alligator biologist with the game commission 
the game commission made 227 arrests statewide for alligator 
violations including poaching from july 1988 to july of this 
year said maj jim ries of the commission 
lt dick lawrence who supervises the game commissions regional 
nuisance gator trapping program recalled a case last year in which 
two men were arrested for dropping concrete blocks on a gators 
head the gator was under a bridge and not threatening anyone 
we ended up going down and killing the gator because he was so 
badly injured lawrence said 
fishing guides have been known to shoot gators and large birds 
that might threaten a customers catch wildlife officials said and 
cattle growers have killed alligators on their ranches because of 
the threat to calves doxey said

a smoke bomb mailed to naacp regional headquarters 
went off today when the package was opened filling the office with 
fumes and slightly injuring eight people officials said 
earl t shinhoster executive director of the southeastern 
regional office of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people said he and his secretary opened a package no 
bigger than a hatbox about 1225 pm and immediately saw sparks 
and a cylinder emitting a yellowish caustic smoke 
atlanta police earlier reported that a fire possibly caused by a 
bomb had broken out at the building but shinhoster said there were 
no flames 
eight people were taken to hospitals suffering discomfort from 
the smoke shinhoster said he said his own eyes and nose were 
burned by the smoke but he wasnt seriously injured 
shinhoster said the smoke filled the twostory office building 
near the atlanta university center campus in less than two minutes 
this is a very evil and dastardly act he said i dont 
know why anyone would want to try to hurt innocent people like 
this 
shinhoster said the package delivered via the us postal 
services priority mail about 1130 am was addressed to the naacp 
office but to no one in particular he said he believed the return 
address was in atlanta 
assistant fire chief walter campbell said the gas was similar to 
tear gas the package remained largely intact and was being looked 
at by investigators he said 
police and fire crews cordoned off a block of martin luther king 
jr drive around the building 
only shinhoster and his secretary were in the naacp office at the 
time but the buildings air conditioning system rapidly took the 
gas throughout the twostory brick office building campbell said 
some of the other offices in the building are medical offices 
among the eight people taken to the hospital were two children 
ages 4 and 12 who were in the building he said shinhoster did not 
immediately seek medical treatment 
us rep john lewis dga said he was in the neighborhood 
speaking to a community group when he heard about the incident and 
rushed to the scene 
anytime something like this would come to the naacp office you 
have to believe its racially motivated lewis said i think 
theres a climate existing in america now twentyfive years later 
after the civil rights movement the seeds of racism are raising 
their ugly heads again 
on the one hand im surprised and shocked this could happen in 
1989 but on the other hand im not he said

the federal reserve board ruled monday that 
japanese firms may continue to fully participate in the market for 
us government securities despite lingering concerns that us 
companies face discrimination in japan 
by a 51 vote the board approved a report from its staff that 
found japan had made much progress in opening its government 
debt market to foreign firms 
consequently the united states should continue to permit 
japaneseowned firms to operate as primary dealers in treasury 
securities the central bank ruled 
although any firm may buy treasury debt only 42 are designated 
by the federal reserve bank of new york as primary dealers eligible 
to trade securities with the central bank as part of its regulation 
of the economy 
omnibus trade legislation passed by congress a year ago required 
the federal reserve to remove foreignowned firms from the primary 
dealer list if their nations did not afford the same competitive 
opportunities to us firms 
the united states runs a persistent deficit with japan in the 
trade of goods one of the ways it makes up part of that gap is 
through the trade of services such as those offered by securities 
firms 
legislators warned that unless the united states insists on full 
access to japanese financial markets the us brokerage industry 
will slip behind in international competition just as us auto and 
steel firms have 
the federal reserve staff conceded the barriers to us 
participation in japanese government debt markets had existed but 
noted substantial improvement 
it specifically noted a decision by japan this april to sell 40 
percent of its 10year bonds the most important government security 
issued through a competitive auction leaving 60 percent to be sold 
through negotiation with a syndicate of securities companies and 
banks 
previously all 10year bonds had been sold through the syndicate 
the staff also noted that foreign participation in the syndicate has 
increased from about 1 percent in 1986 to 8 percent last year 
much progress has been made the structure of the market 
now compares favorably with the state of development in other 
industrial countries and the actions that have been taken in recent 
years to open the market are substantial the staff wrote 
however it added federal reserve officials should continue 
to take every opportunity to urge japan to liberalize its markets 
further and to improve further the openness of competition among 
market participants 
board member martha seger dissented noting that the law requires 
japan to offer the same competitive opportunities not simply to 
improve 
in particular us firms still complain that japanese officials 
provide advance information to japanese firms on government economic 
data putting other firms at a disadvantage however the central 
bank staff said that the japanese have taken steps to curb this 
abuse and that further steps are expected

prominent black activists went 
into hiding as police on monday continued to crack down on a 
campaign to defy apartheid laws and emergency restrictions 
students at three natal province universities defied police 
banning orders and held rallies to declare outlawed student 
organizations would operate openly eight students were held briefly 
and six were charged with attending illegal gatherings 
several hundred sturdents at each university clashed with police 
who came to the campuses to halt the rallies part of a national 
campaign to disregard banning orders placed on organizations during 
the 3yearold national emergency 
police fired tear gas and turned a water cannon on students and 
staff at the multiracial university of nataldurban after a crowd 
of more than 1000 refused several orders to disperse a student 
leader shouting over a megaphone declared the end conscription 
campaign and the south african national students congress 
unbanned as he ran from squads of police scattering the crowd 
students at the white university of natalpietermaritzburg 
encountered police when they marched offcampus with placards 
proclaiming the two organizations unbanned police also 
disrupted a rally at the mostlyindian university of 
durbanwestville where students danced and chanted in celebration 
of the unbanning 
the past few days have been marked by a systematic pattern of 
repression by the state against the defiance campaign said cas 
coovadia of the banned united democratic front the countrys 
largest opposition coalition 
the detention of our leaders and the banning of our meetings 
serves to strengthen our spirit of resistance coovadia said in a 
statement he added that he had gone into hiding but did not name 
any others who had done so 
there have been reports of several activists dissapearing since 
friday when police arrested mohhamed valli moosa the acting 
secretarygeneral of the united democratic front and a chief 
organizer of the defiance campaign he was held under emergency 
regulations that allow police to keep him in custody infefinitely 
without charge 
leon mellet spokesman for the law and order ministry indirectly 
confirmed that activists were hiding it is ironic that they unban 
themselves and then immediately go underground he said 
he said a number of people who had defied the law had been 
arrested and when they sit alone in a police cell they must blame 
those faceless people who irresponsibly urged them to defy the law 
the defiance campaign which began aug 2 has been escalating in 
the days leading up to sept 6 parliamentary elections that exclude 
the 28 millionmember black majority 
police responded by breaking up several weekend antiapartheid 
rallies including a march by blacks at a whitesonly beach at 
cape town and a demonstration at the university of the witwatersrand 
in johannesburg the chairman of the johannesburg rally said major 
speakers from the udf had not arrived sunday because they were in 
hiding 
police said an unsatisfactorily high number of unrest 
incidents had occurred over the weekend in the cape town area and 
that police would continue to use whatever action neccessary to curb 
such protests 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu condemned the police use of 
whips dogs and tear gas to keep blacks off the beaches saturday 
in my experience it is the police who have been creating 
unrest whenever they keep away from an event it goes off 
peacefully whenever they arrive with their quirts tear gas and 
firearms and try to prevent people from peacefully expressing their 
dissent they precipitate confrontation and violence he said

steam service interrupted when a highpressure 
steam pipe exploded beneath a street and killed three people was 
restored monday to the gramercy park south neighborhood 
consolidated edison co said it still was not sure what caused 
the blast that released a scalding roaring jet of steam on the 
sedate residential block it threw mud and chunks of pavement out 
from a 20footdeep crater and broke windows 
the power companys steam piped at 400 degrees under pressure of 
150 pounds per inch heats buildings in winter and powers air 
conditioners in summer 
utility spokeswoman pat richardi but she had no estimate of how 
long it would take to repair the street and reopen it to traffic 
con edison has said one possible explanation for the explosion 
could be that cold water from a nearby leaking pipe hit the hot 
steel steam line and caused a stress fracture that blew open an 
expansion joint 
we dont even have all the pieces yet ms richardi said 
she said the steam main dated from 1952 and the expansion joint 
which was stainless steel or a steel alloy was installed in 1968 
before the blast a con edison crew had closed off the steam line 
while a city crew repaired the water leak and pumped water out of 
utility tunnels beneath the street the utility crew then turned the 
steam back on and the explosion ripped open the street 
one woman was killed while she napped in her thirdfloor 
apartment in the building nearest the blast two con edison 
employees working at the scene also were killed two other utility 
employees were hospitalized with burns

a small federal courtroom became the stage 
today for the latest episode in the jim bakker story his trial on 
charges he cheated his ptl ministry out of 4 million to finance a 
lavish lifestyle 
our faith is in god bakker proclaimed as he arrived at the 
courthouse accompanied by his daughter tammy sue chapman and 
attorney george t davis im glad to have my daughter with me 
the television evangelist ousted from his ptl empire two years 
ago entered the courthouse and said nothing more to reporters 
waiting outside 
about 70 potential jurors were on hand as the selection got under 
way no one was seated this morning us district court judge 
robert potter dismissed four potential jurors two who said they had 
opinions they couldnt overcome in the case one who was a diabetic 
and one who was excused because of unspecified business reasons 
potter told the jury pool there had been a lot of publicity 
about this case and asked jurors if they would be willing to 
have yourself convicted based on publicity 
what im trying to do is get you to put yourself in the place 
of the defendant who has had a lot of publicity in this case 
potter added it makes our job very difficult to find a jury 
bakker is charged with eight counts of mail fraud 15 counts of 
wire fraud and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud if 
convicted on all counts he could be sentenced to 120 years in 
prison and fined more than 5 million 
as the trial opened bakkers wife tammy faye bakker stayed in 
orlando fla where bakker transplanted his ministry to carry on 
their daily live broadcast 
mrs bakker opened the jim and tammy show this morning with 
tears and exhorted listeners to pray for her husband 
we have such trouble things going on in charlotte nc 
today mrs bakker said its like a circus in charlotte nc i 
dont know how possibly jim can get a fair trial in charlotte 
nc his attorneys have been pressing for a change of venue 
she blew a kiss on the air and said i love you sweetheart 
dont you dare give up 
not only is jim on trial people but the church that we know 
is on trial mrs bakker said everything that has to do with 
christian television is on trial when jim walks in that courtroom 
outside the fortresslike granite courthouse there were no 
bakker supporters in sight there were no bakker detractors either 
but there was 22yearold michael williams a former ptl 
supporter and lunch truck operator who said he was there to get a 
little bit of my money back by selling coffee and breakfast 
biscuits to journalists and passersby 
opening arguments were scheduled to begin in a week but defense 
attorneys have renewed their motions to move the trial out of 
charlotte and the western district of north carolina because of 
pretrial publicity 
us magistrate paul taylor rejected a similar motion earlier 
saying publicity had died down in the two years since bakker left 
the ptl ministry he founded but taylor said lawyers could renew 
their arguments before us district court judge robert potter 
during jury selection 
bakker is charged with eight counts of mail fraud 15 counts of 
wire fraud and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud if 
convicted on all counts he could be sentenced to 120 years in 
prison and ordered to pay more than 5 million in fines mrs bakker 
isnt charged 
bakker and his attorneys have declined to discuss their defense 
strategy 
but the evangelist has said he knew little about ptls finances 
i was a pastor and a businessman i was not 
bakker who left the ptl television empire during a sexandmoney 
scandal in 1987 relocated earlier this year to a nearly empty 
shopping center in orlando the show is carried by several 
television stations 
the bakkers have asked viewers to contribute 1 million for a 
defense fund in a letter to supporters two months ago mrs bakker 
said half of that amount had to be raised by the end of the month 
officials of jim and tammy ministries have declined to say how 
much has been raised except to say that supporters have responded 
to the appeal 
it was earlier appeals for 1000 donations to buy lifetime 
partnerships at ptl that landed bakker in federal court 
prosecutors say he and top aides diverted more than 4 million of 
the 158 million contributed under various partnership programs to 
their personal uses 
in eight of the 11 partnerships contributors were promised free 
lodging at the ministrys heritage usa christian retreat and theme 
park at fort mill sc in exchange for their onetime donation of 
1000 
but investigators say donations were spent on the ministrys 
daytoday operating costs and to finance the lavish lifestyles of 
ptl executives rather than the mammoth hotel projects bakker 
promoted on his television show 
richard dortch bakkers former top assistant at the nowdefunct 
ptl pleaded guilty to four charges of fraud and conspiracy aug 8 
and agreed to testify against his former boss 
the trial is expected to focus on the bakkers lifestyle much 
like the trial of james and david taggart two former aides who were 
convicted last month of income tax evasion the two brothers who 
face up to 25 years in prison and 1 million in fines each are 
scheduled to be sentenced friday 
they were convicted of diverting 11 million in ministry funds 
to finance european trips fur coats matching jaguar cars cartier 
jewelry expensive furniture and an apartment in manhattans trump 
tower 
bakker resigned in march 1987 after the charlotte observer 
informed him it was ready to publish a story saying the ministry 
paid hush money to prevent former new york church secretary jessica 
hahn from talking about her 1980 tryst with bakker 
bakker turned the ministry over to the rev jerry falwell who 
put ptl under bankruptcy protection three months later after his 
staff discovered alleged financial irregularities and millions of 
dollars in debts 
potter told potential jurors that a number of people were 
potential witnesses including dortch former ptl board member efrem 
zimbalist jr an actor the taggarts and mrs bakker neither ms 
hahn or falwell was mentioned

bandits killed conservationist george 
adamson near his bush camp the government said monday nine years 
years after the violent death of his wife joy who wrote the 
touching story of elsa the lioness in born free 
adamson 83 was slain when somali bandits who attacked three of 
his assistants opened fire on his vehicle with automatic weapons as 
he tried to run them down said richard leakey kenyas director of 
wildlife two of his assistants also were killed 
the adamsons helped popularize wildlife conservation joy adamson 
propelled them to fame with the books born free living free 
and forever free describing their practice of taking lions born 
in captivity teaching them to survive and releasing them into the 
wild 
she was killed by a servant in a wage dispute in 1980 
adamson died sunday near his camp in the remote kora national 
reserve of northeastern kenya where he helped dozens of lions learn 
to survive in the bush 
leakey said monday three of the british conservationists 
assistants had set off for a nearby airstrip to pick up guests the 
conservationist expected for lunch 
three somalis forced the assistants to stop by shooting out their 
tires then robbed the men and beat one of them with an iron bar 
breaking his legs leakey said 
the shots could be heard in adamsons camp about a mile away and 
he went to investigate with three other assistants as they 
approached the scene an assistant armed with a rifle urged adamson 
to stop the vehicle but he decided to attack instead 
he put his foot on the accelerator and drove straight into the 
bandits and a hail of bullets said leakey who went to kora on 
monday to investigate the killing with philip kilonzo the police 
commissioner it was a tremendous show of bravery 
he said adamson and two assistants were killed but the man with 
the rifle survived by jumping out when he realized adamson did not 
plan to stop 
leakey said the man who was beaten identified the attackers by 
their speech as somalis and heard them tell each other to shoot to 
kill he said 150 security personnel had been sent to the area and 
an 80mile radius around adamsons camp was sealed off 
he said adamson would be buried with honors at kora by the kenyan 
government 
in london the naturalist and filmmaker david attenborough said 
the death of adamson was very very tragic news 
george adamson was an extraordinary man absolutely 
extraordinary said attenborough who made a program about elsa 
and her cubs he became very attached to the lions he was 
prepared to stand up for them against anybody and anything clearly 
that wasnt always popular 
kenyan officials had been concerned about attacks by somali 
tribesmen known as shifta since a major antipoaching effort 
pushed most of them out of kenyas game reserves leakey said 
he said adamson refused additional protection and did not want to 
leave kora where he felt protected by his 16 lions and more than 
half a dozen assistants 
it was largely because of agitation by adamson who moved to kora 
in 1971 that the government made it a game reserve three years 
later 
encroachment by nomadic somalis and their herds led adamson to 
pressure officials into sending the antipoaching troops to remove 
them 
in an interview with the associated press in 1983 adamson said 
he had been told of a plot by somalis to murder him in hopes that 
with him gone there would be little pressure on the government to 
police the reserve 
leakey said authorities believed the motive of sundays attack 
was robbery not murder 
adamson was born in india in 1906 he first visited kenya in 1924 
and later moved to the east african nation joining its game 
department in 1938 he retired in 1963 
when he married joy an austrian artist in 1944 he was game 
warden of kenyas northern frontier district 
twelve years later he brought home three motherless lion cubs 
the one they called elsa became the central character of born 
free 
the adamsons who had no children separated and she moved to the 
shaba game reserve in the late 1960s to work with leopards she was 
killed there in 1980 
adamson whose shoulderlength flaxen hair and goatee made him 
resemble his beloved lions lived in the modest camp at kora on a 
pension interest from a trust joy established and donations from 
admirers 
he wrote two books bwana game and an autobiography my 
pride and joy

solidarity leader lech walesa warned the 
communist party on monday not to demand too much of a role in the 
new government or it could lose everything 
if they play the fool they can lose even more walesa said in 
an interview with the associated press at union headquarters in 
gdansk they will be rejected 
the communist party central committee in a resolution published 
late sunday said it would not support the prime ministerdesignate 
solidarity activist tadeusz mazowiecki unless it was given a number 
of government posts that correspond to its state and political 
potential 
the party did not specify how many or what posts it demanded but 
the resolution made clear the communists want more than just the 
defense and interior portfolios posts solidarity already has 
offered them 
walesa insisted the communists should not fight for keeping 
their posts anymore rather he said they must abandon threats 
and blackmail and earn public support by instituting needed 
reforms 
we need reforms if the party does not understand that and 
starts provocations then it will lose everything walesa said 
walesa said mazowiecki might in the end offer additional seats 
to the communists because the government will need wise people 
but he said solidarity would not submit if the party tried to take 
those offices by force 
mazowiecki charged with the delicate task of forming a 
government took a less confrontational approach in an interview 
with state radio 
i think we should be mutually open to each other and aim at a 
situation that no relations of aggression take place between 
us he said 
mazowiecki was nominated saturday by president wojciech 
jaruzelski who said he made the decision in order to start poland 
on the road of economic and social repair 
the nomination of a solidarity leader was made possible when 
walesa engineered a coalition between the union and two small 
parties that previously had been allied with the communists 
the communist candidate for prime minister czeslaw kiszczek was 
forced to resign after solidarity said it would not support his 
government 
the recent developments marked a onceinconceivable victory for 
solidarity which was crushed in 1981 when jaruzelski imposed 
martial law and banned the next year mazowiecki himself was jailed 
for a year 
mazowiecki met monday with various political leaders in warsaw 
including peasant party leader aleksander bentkowski the party is 
one of solidaritys two coalition partners 
communist first secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski meanwhile met 
jaruzelski to discuss the political situation and the weekend 
communist plenum 
in an interview in the party newspaper trybuna ludu on monday 
rakowski said he is looking for ways to strengthen the powers of 
the party 
hundreds of thousands of our comrades are waiting today all 
over poland for the voice of their central committee on the issues 
most significant not only for the party but for the whole 
country he said 
do we capitulate or charge forward do we resign from the 
values of socialism or are we ready to defend them 
he said the central committee resolution reflects the feelings of 
those in the party who do not want to put up their hands in 
surrender 
daniel passent editor of rakowskis former newspaper the 
partylinked polityka told the bbc that the party probably would 
ask for the powerful ministries of foreign affairs and finance in 
addition to defense and interior which oversee the army and police 
mazowiecki said sunday he has made no final decision on the 
makeup of his government but that it would be open to proreform 
forces from all parties 
mazowieckis nomination must be approved by the sejm the lower 
house of the national assembly sejm speaker mikolaj kozakiewicz 
confirmed monday that the sejm had received the nomination and it 
would be considered wednesday 
solidarity the united peasant party and the democratic party 
have enough sejm votes to elect mazowiecki without communist support 
the communist resolution was critical of the two smaller parties 
for switching allegiance to solidarity and accused solidarity of 
breaking the roundtable accords of the past spring which did 
not anticipate such a rapid switchover in power 
it warned solidarity that it was taking a risk if it tries to 
govern without communist help 
neither of the countrys main political forces the puwp 
communists or solidarity can independently or even more 
against one another face the dangers and pull the country out of 
collapse it said

after a 12year 44 billionmile space 
odyssey voyager 2 fired its thrusters today to take final aim 
toward neptune the most distant and last unexplored planet due for 
a visit by a spacecraft from earth 
this is the final movement in the voyager symphony of the outer 
planets said voyager project scientist edward stone referring to 
voyagers previous exploration of jupiter saturn and uranus 
were in for a good ride and its great everybody can share in 
the discoveries that are going to unfold in the next week stone 
said during a late morning news conference 
the small adjustment in direction today was the last needed to 
target voyager for thursdays close encounter with neptune and 
fridays flight past its largest moon triton the maneuver meant 
to nudge voyager to the right and increased its speed a tiny 11 
mph means voyager will fly closest to neptune about 855 pm pdt 
thursday 
engineers at nasas jet propulsion laboratory received a signal 
from the spacecraft at 815 am pdt today indicating the thrusters 
started firing at 409 am it takes four hours and six minutes for 
the signals to reach earth even at the 186000milepersecond 
speed of light 
the approaching encounter with neptune has drawn scientists here 
from all over the world 
its almost like being on a ship of discovery like marco polo 
magellan and columbus says jurrie van der woude a laboratory 
spokesman 
for most of us this is the last picture show the last foreign 
shores we visit in the solar system 
todays schedule of activities for voyager included searching for 
northern lights around neptunes north pole studying the planets 
turbulent weather and snapping pictures of triton and another moon 
nereid the probe also was programmed to make 39 images of the 
region in which partial rings of debris may be orbiting the planet 
as voyager gets nearer to neptune cable television stations will 
carry live nasa broadcasts of photographs from the planet 
on its approach to the solar systems fourthlargest planet the 
picturesnapping space probe already has discovered four moons in 
addition to triton and nereid which had been discovered from earth 
as well as two partial rings of debris orbiting neptune 
voyager also discovered neptune has a magnetic field 
hurricanelike storms dubbed scooters with 400 mph winds 
2700milewide bands vaguely like earths jet streams and a 
8100by4100mile great dark spot probably a huge storm like 
jupiters great red spot 
nasa listed voyagers position as of 9 am today as 2743 
billion miles from earth and 3211 million miles from neptune 
approaching the planet at 42310 mph since it was launched in 1977 
voyager 2 has traveled a curving path totaling 44 billion miles 
with no one planning a mission to pluto neptune is the last 
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from earth in 
the foreseeable future 
neptune usually the eighth planet from the sun currently is the 
ninth and most distant pluto follows an elongated elliptical orbit 
and is closer now 
thursday night voyager makes its closest approach to neptune by 
skirting 3000 miles above the planets cloud tops much closer 
than its encounters with jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus 
in 1986 
sunday was the 12th anniversary of the spacecrafts launch from 
florida on aug 20 1977 the neptune encounter is the climax of the 
865 million twinspacecraft voyager mission which also saw 
voyager 1 explore jupiter in 1979 and saturn in 1980 
sending voyager to neptune was like sinking a 2260mile golf 
putt assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments 
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green 
according to the voyager neptune travel guide written by 
mission planning manager charles kohlhase and his staff 
about 170 researchers from around the world are at the laboratory 
for the neptune encounter they will share ultimate exhilaration as 
frontrow observers for humanitys first closeup look at the 
planet a bluegreen ball nearly four times earths diameter 
but their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because voyagers 
neptune encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a us 
spacecraft future probes will orbit their target planets magellan 
at venus galileo at jupiter and the mars observer 
up to 8000 photographs from voyagers two television cameras and 
discoveries by 10 other science experiments are expected to pour in 
so quickly that the national aeronautics and space administration 
will conduct daily news conferences through aug 29 
some scientists have said the planet may have 50 or more ring 
arcs different than the complete rings encircling saturn and uranus 
they also say neptunes magnetic field may create auroras like 
earths northern lights and also may trap orbiting radiation belts 
similar to earths van allen belts 
todays course correction was designed to assure voyager can aim 
a radio signal at earth when the probe starts to pass behind neptune 
by measuring changes in the signal scientists hope to determine 
neptunes atmospheric pressures temperatures and chemical makeup 
whether ring arcs are made of dust sand pebbles or boulders and 
how material is distributed inside neptune 
after the encounter voyager ii like its sister craft will 
continue on its way out of the solar system it will continue to 
send data back to earth until its fuel runs out in 28 years

as much as 34 billion is needed to clean up 
10 of the great lakes dirtiest areas according to a study billed 
as a step toward putting a price tag on making the lakes safe for 
wildlife and people 
because of the high cost governments should explore creative 
means of financing the cleanup such as establishing a trust fund and 
suing polluters said the study by the northeastmidwest institute 
the institute does research for members of congress from 18 
northeastern and midwestern states 
the report is significant because of its emphasis on solving the 
problem whereas earlier studies dealt primarily with what caused 
the pollution and which areas were worse off said michael j 
donahue executive director of the great lakes commission in ann 
arbor mich 
the real challenge right now is how to pay for the 
cleanup donahue said any information that can put a number on 
cleanup costs and give some ideas on financing would be very 
valuable 
the 45page report says experts have just begun assessing the 
costs of cleaning up the lakes where roughly 300 toxic chemicals 
have been discovered in fish and some wildlife species are in 
decline 
a uscanadian commission has classified 42 separate areas as so 
polluted they are unfit for swimming drinking fishing and in some 
cases navigation rough estimates of cleanup costs have been made 
for 10 of them 
they include fox rivergreen bay and milwaukee harbor in 
wisconsin waukegan harbor ill grand calumet riverindiana 
harbor ind saginaw riversaginaw bay clinton river and rouge 
river mich black river and ashtabula riverharbor ohio and 
rochester embayment ny 
the cost of cleaning up all 10 areas is roughly 29 billion to 
34 billion the report said adding that the estimate is probably 
too low because cleanup costs have been set for only 19 of the 55 
contamination sources identified at the sites 
contaminated sediments are the biggest pollution source the 
report said followed by leaking landfills and hazardouswaste sites

the question among many latvian activists 
who gathered here monday is no longer whether their tiny republic 
will declare independence from the soviet union but when 
activists at a conference on national selfdetermination said 
sovereignty within the soviet union a radical goal just nine 
months ago is no longer enough 
we now have the strong belief that the large majority of the 
latvian nation favors only independence said ianis freimanis 
chairman of the prodemocracy latvian peoples front 
as a result freimanis said in an interview the 200000member 
peoples front will vote in october whether to change the 
organizations platform from sovereignty to full independence i 
believe this will be approved he said 
the peoples front asked latvians on may 31 to make their 
opinions known since then three volumes of petitions containing 
hundreds of thousands of signatures of people favoring independence 
have poured into the peoples front office on a cobblestoned street 
in the old town of riga he said 
although latvia is barely half latvian russians see the 
catastrophic economic situation and also dont believe they will be 
better off inside the soviet union freimanis said 
their only question is can we be citizens of an independent 
latvia we say yes and their questions are over 
the lithuanian peoples front called sajudis also is 
considering a campaign for full independence and its ruling council 
will consider the issue wednesday the 50th anniversary of the 
molotovribbentrop pact 
that agreement signed on aug 23 1939 by nazi foreign minister 
joachim von ribbentrop and his soviet counterpart vyacheslav 
molotov dealt most of poland to the nazis and the thenindependent 
baltic republics of latvia lithuania and estonia to the soviet 
union 
in latvia the only reformers still promoting only sovereignty 
within the soviet union are communist party leaders activists said 
among nonparty activists disputes are over tactics 
the peoples front favors winning electoral control of the 
latvian parliament the first multiplecandidate balloting for the 
latvian supreme soviet is scheduled in february 
the national independence movement of latvia in contrast wants 
an alternative parliament 
the group is signing up voters to participate in its own 
balloting 
when half of latvias 15 million residents are registered the 
independence movement plans elections of local councils and then a 
parliament said alexander kirsteins a board member of the group 
they will say they do not want soviet citizenship he said 
but freimanis fears such a strategy could cost activists control 
of the existing parliament 
baltic activists have used president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms as well as legal and parliamentary maneuvering to capture 
most of the baltic seats in the new soviet parliament in moscow 
giving them a national platform and credibility 
next latvian activists plan a petition drive to ask that a 
parliamentary commission be set up to judge 1940 elections in the 
baltic states illegal freimanis said those elections held with 
the soviet army occupying the baltics brought to power parliaments 
that promptly pleaded for their nations to become absorbed by the 
soviet union 
sen bob kastens rwis told the activists from around the 
soviet union and the soviet bloc that americans of all ethnic 
backgrounds support your struggle because they defend freedom and 
democracy for all 
the united states has never recognized the soviet takeover of the 
baltics and representatives of latvia lithuania and estonia 
maintain separate embassies in washington

antiapartheid groups before talks to end racial discrimination 
the leaders seeking a new stategy toward south africa 
conditionally adopted a policy document outlining six preconditions 
for talks between the south african government and opposition groups 
they said the conditions long demanded by african national 
congress guerrillas were needed to create a climate necessary for 
negotiations the congress drafted the summit declaration itself 
the document said talks could create the possibility to end 
apartheid through negotiations it said the government of south 
africa had the urgent responsibility to accept such talks 
the fourday african summit was attended by seven african heads 
of state on its opening day monday 
its declaration adopted by the 16member organization of african 
unity ad hoc committee on southern africa will be presented to the 
next summit of the 101member nonaligned movement in belgrade next 
month

prospects for talks in south africa when he welcomes acting south 
african president fw de klerk to zambia on monday 
besides ending the emergency and lifting bans on antiapartheid 
groups and individual activists the harare summits conditions 
included the removal of all troops from south africas black

ceasefire the formation of an interim government and a 
constitution for a nonracial democratic south africa based on 
oneman onevote the declaration said 
we support the position of the majority of the people of south 
africa that these objectives and not the amendment or reform of the 
apartheid system should be the aims of negotiation the leaders

society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
african and western diplomats speaking on condition of 
anonymity said while the declaration was couched in conciliatory 
terms it did not represent a significant new departure by 
guerrillas fighting in south africa or african leaders 
for its part south africa has long insisted the african national 
congress and the smaller rival pan africanist congress guerrilla 
group renounce violence before any talks 
the harare declaration said south africas black majority 
reserved the right to pursue armed struggle and stronger 
international economic sanctions against south africa

efforts to cut the federal deficit to the level 
set by law are falling short and will require decisive action by 
congress if 162 billion in automatic spending reductions are to be 
avoided president bushs chief budget official said monday 
it remains my hope and my cautiously optimistic expectation 
that necessary legislation may be enacted to lower the deficit to 
the 110 bilion range richard g darman director of the office of 
management and budget said in a letter to the president 
the automatic cuts can be avoided darman wrote if congress will 
fully implement the budget agreement worked out with the white house 
last april although there has been some progress toward its 
implementation virtually none of the spending cuts and revenue 
increases required to fulfill the terms of the agreement has yet 
been enacted darman said 
legislation to carry out the agreement will be the chief business 
facing congress when it returns from a summer recess on sept 5 
darmans projection of the deficit is based on forecasts about 
inflation and economic growth that are more optimistic than those of 
the congressional budget office 
cbo last week issued its own estimate that unless the budget 
agreement is implemented the deficit in budget year 1990 which 
begins oct 1 would reach 1415 billion or 255 billion higher 
than the omb prediction 
most of that differece is caused by the two agencies varying 
forecasts of how the economy will fare next year and on technical 
details of how the recently enacted bailout of the savings and loan 
industry will be implemented 
under the law only the omb figures are used to determine whether 
the deficit has been reduced sufficiently and whether most 
government spending programs must be slashed across the board to 
close the gap 
the grammrudman law which requires a balanced budget by 1993 
limits the 1990 deficit to 100 billion but includes 10 billion 
cushion before acrosstheboard spending cuts are forced however 
once the cuts are ordered they must be sufficient to reduce the 
deficit to 100 billion not 110 billion 
under darmans forecast the 1990 deficit will be 1162 billion 
if congress takes no further action to reduce it that compares with 
just under 170 billion this year 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee called the omb forecast artificially low even with 
these dubious economic and spending assumptions we face the 
possibility of harsh acrosstheboard spending cuts this fall 81 
billion in domestic programs and 81 billion in defense he said 
in a statement 
even if those automatic reductions are made panetta said we 
still need 30 billion to 60 billion in additional deficit 
reduction for 1991 
social security and some other safety net programs are exempt 
from automatic cuts even so said rep bill frenzel of minnesota 
senior republican on the house budget committee said i think 
people will notice in a big hurry if the mandatory cuts take 
effect 
i think we are going to have some big difficulties appoving a 
package of spending cuts and revenue increases to implement the 
april agreement frenzel told reporters but my guess is that 
congress is going to lurch across the finish line all right and 
avoid the automatic reductions he said 
darmans report offers examples of how the ax would fall if the 
mandated spending cuts take effect

japans socialist party on monday backed away from 
its call for dismantling the countrys military forces and ending 
its security treaty with the united states 
the major policy shift represented an effort to attract other 
opposition parties to a coalition with the socialists japans 
largest opposition party 
tsuruo yamaguchi secretary general of the socialists also said 
his party wont seek any drastic changes in the countrys capitalist 
economic policies 
he said the socialists would accept the existence for the time 
being of japans self defense forces but would continue to 
advocate peace and disarmament 
he said the party would seek only a gradual reduction of us 
bases in japan where 64000 us troops are stationed 
yamaguchi told party regional officials the policy changes were 
aimed at creating an alliance with other opposition groups which 
have criticized the partys past platform as unrealistic 
ms doi said she had met with leaders of three other 
noncommunist opposition parties and they had agreed to work 
together while respecting each others policies 
the parties the buddhistaffiliated clean government party the 
democratic socialist party and the united social democratic party 
are unified in their opposition to an unpopular new sales tax that 
the liberal democrats pushed through parliament however they 
disagree on a range of other issues including nuclear power and 
relations with north korea and south korea 
until monday the socialists had opposed the mutual security 
treaty with the united states and the self defense forces which 
they said violated a constitutional ban on maintenance of land sea 
and air forces japanese courts have interpreted the constitution as 
allowing defensive military forces 
under the moderate leadership of chairwoman takako doi the 
socialists emerged the biggest winner last month in elections for 
parliaments upper house 
opposition parties now hold a majority of seats in the upper 
chamber and hope to eliminate the governing liberal democratic 
partys majority in the lower house in general elections that must 
be held by july 
hiroshi mitsuzuka chairman of the conservative governing partys 
policy affairs research council said his party would transfer power 
to the opposition rather than seek a coalition government if it 
loses its majority in the lower chamber 
the socialists could lead their own coalition government if a 
unified opposition captures a majority of seats in the lower house 
yamaguchi called on his party monday to shift its focus from 
criticizing the liberal democrats who have led japan for 34 years 
to creating positive policy alternatives 
he said the partys new policies also call for tighter civilian 
control of the military and a return to a ceiling on defense outlays 
of 1 percent of japans gross national product 
the japanese government scrapped the selfimposed limit in 1987 
following us pressure to spend more on defense 
yamaguchi said japan should maintain its close us relations 
but that the ties should be based on equality and mutual benefit and 
be balanced with good relations with other nations 
opponents of the usjapan mutual security treaty have charged 
that an alliance with the united states could hurt relations with 
other nations and drag japan into a nuclear war

newspapers trumpeted the publication of a new 
collection of new writings by senior leader deng xiaoping who turns 
85 on tuesday including a speech that says china doesnt need 
westernstyle democracy 
headlines on the front pages of all major newspapers monday 
intensified the spotlight that has been focused on him since he 
ordered the june crackdown on dissent and reinforced the image of 
an emerging personality cult 
the xinhua news agency said one speech in the collection 
originally delivered in 1957 and only recently made public will 
appear in full in tuesdays peoples daily the communist party 
newspaper the speech also was read on the radio monday evening 
in it deng said implementing small democratic measures would make 
westernstyle big democracy unecessary 
we do not support the idea of carrying out big democracy in 
china he said we can do without such democracy only if we have 
small democracy 
xinhua said that by small democracy deng meant that the 
communist party should offer channels through which the masses can 
make complaints express their own views and appeal 
the democracy speech was published recently in the magazine 
party building but it has not appeared before in the popular 
media 
the new volume of dengs writings from 193865 has 39 selections 
30 of them previously unpublished it is one of two new books by or 
about deng since he ordered troops to crack down on student 
protestors in beijing on june 34 killing hundreds and perhaps 
thousands of people 
the other book twentyeight years of deng xiaoping details 
his life during the same period 
xinhua said it is about dengs great courage foresight and 
sagacity and describes dengs brilliant contributions and 
exceptional services to the revolution 
such lavish praise was unusual before the recent political 
turmoil but in the past two months it has become increasingly 
common hinting of an emerging cult of personality that deng 
previously had shunned 
major newspapers also praised deng for his triumphs 
a photograph of deng sitting in an armchair and gesturing while 
speaking accompanied the article and was identified as taken on 
july 2 officials at xinhuas photo department said it was the most 
recent available photo of the leader who is believed to be 
seriously ill 
he was last seen in public on june 9 talking to martial law 
troops in beijing 
the photo does not show where deng was or who he was talking with 
chinese throughout the country have been ordered to study dengs 
june speech to the martial law troops the official press has given 
prominent play to dengs writings and speeches including a 
previously unpublished 1956 speech on suiting marxism and leninism 
to china printed in major papers last week 
this month movie theaters across the country began showing a 
film on how the 25yearold deng led communist forces in 
southeastern china 
a bronze bust of deng was unveiled at the china art gallery last 
month part of an exhibit on the democracy movement that the 
government calls a counterrevolutionary rebellion

solidarity leader lech walesa said monday 
there is a place for the communist party in poland if it embraces 
democratic reform but it cannot try to hang on to power and 
privilege by force 
fish begins to rot from its head i am beginning from the head 
we need reforms if the party doesnt undertand that and starts 
provoking and only provoking and they are then it will lose 
everything he said 
walesa advanced his goal to end the communist partys 45year 
monopoly on political power when president wojciech jaruzelski 
nominated solidarity adviser tadeusz mazowiecki as prime minister 
saturday 
the party central committee after an emergency weekend meeting 
threatened to withhold support from the first east bloc government 
without a communist at the helm if it does not receive a significant 
enough role 
in an interview with the associated press at solidaritys 
headquarters in gdansk walesa said there is room in the government 
for the communist party if its members accept democracy and 
pluralism 
they the party should not fight for keeping their posts 
anymore if they are wise we ourselves will offer them those posts 
because we need wise poeple no matter what membership they have 
he said but if they want to take posts by force we wont give 
them 
we are not against the party but we are against its monopoly 
and stupidity if this nomenklatura understands what the point is 
it will also be needed he said referring those given control of 
key political and economic jobs virtue of their party membership 
he said the party must catch up with the times to survive 
if they play the fool they can lose even more he said 
they will be rejected and if they understand what these times 
mean the party may rule for a long time because there are many 
wonderful people there who are prepared for that but they have to 
change the system their concept 
asked why after initial reluctance solidarity decided to forge 
ahead and try to form a government so quickly walesa said the 
independent movements acheivements since april negotiation of 
political and economic reforms restoration of its legal status 
after a sevenyear ban victories in historically democratic 
elections with the promise of fully free voting in four years were 
insecure as long as the party remained on top 
we had wonderful uprisings in 1956 68 70 and 80 it was 
beautiful society sprung up society got some things sometimes 
quite a lot and then the party always revived itself and took away 
whatever society had achieved he said 
the problems was bureaucrats they were always arranged in such 
a way that they could take away whatever society achieved and it 
was the same this time 
despite its stunning election victory in june solidarity could 
not control the government due to an april accord that guaranteed a 
communistled coalition the majority in parliament 
when jaruzelski went from party first secretary to president the 
prime minister became first secretary and the interior minister was 
named prime minister walesa decided he could not wait 
the worst combination for the rebirth of the monopoly had 
emerged he said 
that is why despite that i wanted to do something big only in 
four years i couldnt wait the monopoly of the party would have 
been rebuilt so quickly that there would have been nothing in four 
years that is why we marched in 
by creating a coalition with two minor parties long allied with 
the communists walesa put together a parliament majority and 
proposed candidates for prime minister to jaruzelski 
now mazowiecki must put together a government that will secure 
the help poland needs to reverse its economic decline stop soaring 
inflation reduce a foreign debt of 39 billion and fill the empty 
shelves 
walesa said he is concerned by poles impatience with the failure 
of the economy to improve but that the political climate will be 
for changes and reforms 
he said there is no rush for the west to come up with an aid 
program but it can expect help because of the tremendous steps 
poland has made toward democracy 
it is not time for the west yet first comes formation of the 
government and its first moves wise moves then it will be time to 
really get into it although even today we need help because without 
it there will be no first movements 
we ourselves did so much more than the west expected if so we 
can expect more from the west too thats obvious he said 
looking east walesa said polands warsaw pact neighbors need not 
be concerned as long as they do not interfer 
we have no aspirations to lead reform outside polands 
borders he said 
if it our concept fits somebody in the bloc we are not 
claiming a monopoly they can follow us they can boycott us as 
long nobody disturbs us he said 
so far nobody is disturbing us and that is very good and we 
hope to keep this status because we need it 
when asked if he thought solidarity will succeed walesa smiled 
and said of course but it will be hard because it is very 
complicated

elbireh occupied west bank ap at 14 amjad jibril tawil 
liked reading mysteries and wanted to be a technician when he grew 
up 
he was born in denver but died in this town where his 
palestinian family has its roots 
mystery and controversy surrounds his death accusations by 
tawils family that he was tortured and then shot in the chest by 
soldiers have involved us consular officials in the case and led 
the army to exhume the body and perform an autopsy sunday 
the israeli army said monday that based on a reconstruction of 
events by an army investigator and a government autopsy the 
conclusion is that the death of the boy was not caused by the 
israeli security forces the statement did not say who was 
suspected of killing tawil nor did it give details of the autopsy 
it said police were investigating 
the tall thing youth left home wednesday to go to prayers at the 
alein mosque his body was found friday by a shepherd in the 
mountains outside this town nine miles north of jerusalem 
what happened in between is uncertain 
ayman tawil said his cousin got caught up in a protest outside 
the mosque in which youths threw stones and the army responded with 
gunfire a frequent occurence after moslem prayers in west bank 
towns and villages 
maybe he was participating or he just happened to be in the 
area ayman said 
other relatives described tawil as not interested in politics and 
not active in the 20monthold palestinian uprising they said he 
spent much of his time reading or raising birds 
we used to talk all the time but it was only about our pigeons 
and our chickens said nabil amreh 14 another cousin 
ayman tawil said his cousins friends saw him run away from the 
protest toward the mountains where palestinian youths from elbireh 
and neighboring ramallah usually hide when chased by soldiers 
when tawil did not return thursday the family thought he was 
arrested a woman relative who would not give here name said she 
shouted to palestinians jailed at ramallah military headquarters 
who shouted back that tawil had been there but was taken away 
ayman tawil told reporters he had seen the body before it was 
buried by palestinian youths there were burns on his body some 
of his teeth were knocked out and there was a bullet in the 
chest he said 
the family believe the burns and broken teeth are signs of 
torture they hired an israeli lawyer leah tzemel who said sunday 
that authorities violated an agreement to delay an autopsy until an 
independent pathologist came from abroad 
they didnt wait for our doctor to arrive although there was a 
promise she said there are results but they refuse to give 
them to the family 
ms tzemel noted that autopsy results often are kept from 
palestinian families and said she was trying to get a second burial 
delayed until the foreign pathologist arrived 
amal arafat an english teacher at the friends school in 
ramallah said his pupil spent much of his spare time reading 
novels especially ones with plots of intrique or suspense 
a week before his death ms arafat said the boy wrote a paper 
about his future hopes 
he want to be a technician she said he had an uncle in 
jordan a technician who really liked his job amjad thought the 
pay would be good too 
tawil recently switched from english to arabic curriculum his 
family is a large clan with many connections to the united states 
amjads father wathak works in miami and was flying home sunday 
the boy returned to his mothers hometown in 1983 in the united

michael williams once contributed to jim 
bakkers ptl ministry but on monday he was just trying to make an 
honest buck off it 
the 22yearold williams set up his lunch truck called the 
tummy taxi in a parking lot next door to the federal courthouse 
where bakker went on trial on conspiracy and fraud charges from 
that strategic location he sold coffee and food to journalists and 
passersby 
i thought i would try to get a little bit of my money back 
williams said i gave money to him regularly right up until he 
resigned even a little after he left 
williams said he bought his parents a lifetime partnership for 
1000 in the ptl ministry and planned to give it to them for 
christmas in 1987 
but they never got to use it he said bakker quit the ptl 
ministry in march 1987 in a sexandmoney scandal soon after the 
ministry went into bankruptcy and later was sold to a canadian 
developer 
williams who lives in charlotte operates the lunch truck and a 
copy toner recovery business he said he comes from a methodist 
background but developed the charismatic mindset when he went to 
oral roberts university in oklahoma 
he said he knew the bakkers spent lavishly but wasnt concerned 
about it in the years before bakker resigned 
i knew they had a more luxurious lifestyle than any other 
minister i knew he said but that really didnt bother me until 
i found out how much better it really was when youre talking 
millions of dollars thats a different story

police said monday they are considering filing 
criminal charges over the latenight sinking of a pleasure boat by a 
dredger on the river thames in which 25 people perished and 38 are 
still unaccounted for 
divers aided by more than two dozen police launches continued 
to search the tidal river and salvaged hull of the marchioness for 
more bodies from the accident early sunday the worst on the thames 
this century 
police reported 87 people survived 
investigators said they have a list of 38 names who we have 
strong reason to believe were on board but are as yet unaccounted 
for 
the 90ton marchioness had been chartered for a birthday party 
with guests from the modeling photography and banking worlds it 
collided with the bowbelle a 1475ton sandandgravel dredger and 
sank in minutes 
police said they have released the dredgers captain and second 
mate who were detained after the accident but expected to question 
them again they said they also questioned the five other members of 
the dredgers crew 
a police spokeswoman said investigators were considering filing 
charges of unlawful killing similar to manslaughter but 
refused to say who might be charged 
police the department of transports marine accident 
investigation branch and the port of london authority were 
investigating the accident 
the independent and evening standard newspapers reported a 
disagreement had developed between the captains of the two vessels 
over which craft had the right of way under the central span of 
southwark bridge where the collision occurred 
it seems that both captains thought that they were in the 
right but technically the actions of both could be held up to 
scrutiny the evening standard quoted an unidentified river 
authority source as saying 
jane carmichael of tidal cruises the firm that owns the 
marchioness said that although smaller craft usually stick to the 
side arches marchioness captain stephen faldo was correct to move 
through the center early sunday because of tide conditions 
we do not know what went wrong she said our captain was 
acting totally correctly faldo is missing 
scotland yard declined to comment on the newspaper reports 
police said they listened to taperecorded radio traffic between 
the captains of both vessels and shore control for clues to the 
crash 
after visiting the accident scene transport secretary cecil 
parkinson announced new safety rules including making charter 
vessels record the number of passengers and give them airlinestyle 
safety instructions 
the new requirements effective tuesday came amid lawmakers 
calls for increased safety on the thames 
parkinson also announced more port of london authority river 
patrols and random inspections of passenger vessels 
we want to learn from this and make sure it doesnt happen 
again said parkinson who cut short a vacation abroad after being 
informed of the accident 
relatives of victims tossed flowers into the water near the site 
where the marchioness sank the stretch of river reopened for normal 
traffic but tour boats did not operate in honor of the dead 
as the tide dropped the hull of the marchioness became fully 
visible resting on its side in a mudbank the dance floor exposed 
to the bright sunshine seat covers menus and bits of debris 
floated to the surface of the river 
the boat went down shortly after leaving for a 1 amtodawn 
cruise celebrating the 26th birthday of london financier antonio 
vasconcellos he is among the missing 
the doubledeck marchioness was struck from behind and run over 
by the dredger according to investigators the pleasure boats top 
deck was sheared off 
scores of people who had been drinking and dancing below deck 
were carried down with the hull as the boat sank quickly 
the last serious accident on the thames occurred in 1878 when 
the princess alice paddle steamer was struck by a coal carrying 
ship about 700 people perished

thousands of east germans are escaping 
through hungary in the largest flow to the west since the berlin 
wall was built in august 1961 
more than 1000 east germans have reached austria since saturday 
officials said monday and the red cross has opened an emergency 
facility near the border in anticipation of more 
the exodus of east germans began after hungary one of the most 
liberal soviet bloc nations began in may to dismantle barbed wire 
and other barriers on the frontier it said freer hungarian travel 
regulations made a fortified border obsolete 
east germans have difficulty getting permission for travel to the 
west from their strict communist government but can visit hungary 
with ease more than 2000 east germans are thought to have crossed 
illegally into austria from hungary since may 
mti the official hungarian news agency quoted capt istvan 
szoke of the border guard monday as saying 15000 people had been 
caught crossing hungarys borders illegally in 1989 and the number 
was expected to reach 20000 by years end 
another dispatch from the agency said five citizens of romania 
an eastbloc country that has rejected liberal reforms made it into 
hungary after one was seriously wounded in a struggle with a 
romanian border guard it said they crossed the frontier early 
sunday 
the last time so many east european refugees fled over the 
hungarian border to austria was in 1956 when soviet troops and 
tanks crushed the antistalinist hungarian uprising 
west germany automatically grants citizenship to east germans 
the current tide has prompted it to urge the government in east 
berlin to adopt political and economic reform being promoted by the 
soviet union 
many of the east germans arriving in the west say they left 
because of the regimes resistance to change 
officials said 350450 east germans entered austria from hungary 
on monday 
on saturday hundreds pressed through a border gate that normally 
is closed but was opened for a hungarianaustrian event to promote 
european unity 
dieter graf von bruehl the west german ambassador told austrian 
television sunday his embassy took in 660 east germans on saturday 
and another 160 on sunday he said the average had been 50 to 80 a 
day for three weeks 
officials say the true numbers are higher because many refugees 
travel on with friends or relatives from west germany without 
stopping at the embassy 
manfred kersten spokesman for the west german resettlement camp 
in giessen where most refugees go said 1400 east germans arrived 
over the weekend 
more than 65000 east germans emigrated or escaped to west 
germany in 1989 kersten said 10000 had arrived since the beginning 
of august 
the red cross emergency facility is at moerbisch on lake neusiedl 
near austrias border with hungary it provides east germans with 
food and medical attention 
heinrich unger a red cross official appealed on state radio 
monday for contributions of clothing shoes and towels 
witnesses at the border said most hungarian and austrian border 
officials appeared sympathetic to the refugees the hungarian daily 
magyar hirlap quoted a witness as saying an east german woman 
dropped her baby and a hungarian guard helped her pickup the child 
then waved her across the frontier

poland offers enormous investment opportunities 
for us businesses if it can survive its political crisis and 
achieve stability rep john dingell just returned from a trip to 
eastern europe said monday 
they really want american investment and theyll take almost 
anything that will help them said dingell dmich the chairman 
of the house energy and commerce committee returned saturday from a 
nearly twoweek trip to eastern europe with 11 other members of the 
panel 
the congressmen spent four days in poland and met with leaders of 
the solidarity labor movement including lech walesa 
the polish leaders showed more enthusiasm for us investment 
joint ventures and technical assistance than for loans dingell 
said but american businesses are hesitant to join such ventures 
while the political situation is unsettled he said 
american business has to know there is stability he said 
theyve got to know their money will be protected while its 
there that it wont be subject to chaos 
dingell said the banking food processing and transportation 
industries could tap vast markets in poland theres a crying need 
for consumer goods all over the iron curtain he said 
poles do not trust their countrys banking system but would be 
eager to invest in us banks dingell said walesa thinks theres 
5 billion stuffed in mattresses and pillows all over poland that 
people would put in the banks if they had any confidence in 
them he said 
the us is sending 119 in direct aid to poland while pushing a 
multinational effort to provide poland with nearly 1 billion in 
extra cash this year by pressuring western banks and governments to 
reschedule the 39 billion debt it owes 
dingell said that help is fine so far but should be expanded as 
polands new government shows it is ready to implement economic 
reforms he said 
this country has got to recognize that that our economic 
political diplomatic and military selfinterests ride on the 
success of the poles he said if they succeed in what theyre 
doing well have moved more toward world peace and economic 
progress than anyone can imagine

when the antiaids drug azt was discovered 25 
years ago aids didnt exist and dr james horwitz was dismayed that 
his efforts to create a cancer cure had failed 
but while horwitz lacked the foresight to patent his drug he 
says he believed at the time that his discovery would eventually be 
useful 
what we said at the time which was very prophetic is that we 
have a very interesting class of compounds waiting for a disease to 
cure horwitz a researcher at the michigan cancer foundation 
said in an interview published monday 
on thursday secretary of health and human services louis 
sullivan recommended immediate food and drug administration approval 
of azt for treating people who carried the aids antibodies even if 
they had no symptoms of the disease 
a wideopen market for the drug is bittersweet for horwitz 
since he never took out a patent when he developed the compound 
in 1964 he stands to gain nothing financially from its success 
pharmaceutical analysts have predicted 1 billion in azt sales by 
1992 and horwitz could have received huge profits for the first 17 
years had he taken out a patent 
patents thats the first question my wife asked me he said 
azt was developed as a cancerfighting drug but animal studies 
showed that it wasnt effective it was put on the shelf until the 
mid1980s when burroughs wellcome co looked into its use as a 
treatment for herpes 
that too failed but in 1985 burroughs wellcome sent a batch 
of azt along with some other drugs to the national institutes of 
health in its search for a drug to fight the human immunodeficiency 
virus that causes aids 
those experiments showed promise and more were ordered leading 
to sullivans announcement last week azt does not cure aids but it 
can dramatically slow down the development of the disease 
sure i could be a millionaire horwitz said but on the 
other hand i always felt that if i could leave some legacy 
regarding my work at the cancer foundation my life would be 
meaningful 
but he added the money would have been nice dont 
underestimate it

white house chief of staff john 
sununu on monday defended payments made to new hampshire officials 
by the owners of the seabrook nuclear plant while he was governor 
calling it a catch22 situation 
sununu said the payments were made under a 1981 law that was 
not the bestcrafted piece of legislation under it seabrooks 
owner public service co of new hampshire was charged by the state 
for work done on emergency evacuation plans for the area around the 
reactor 
the presidential aide briefing reporters covering vacationing 
president bush was asked about news stories that several prominent 
republicans including his former deputy chief of staff david 
carney had been paid by seabrooks owner 
the fund was created under a law passed in 1981 two years 
before i became governor sununu said the law was a law that 
carried a catch22 in it 
it was a reference to the title of joseph hellers 1961 book 
about world war ii the phrase the book popularized refers to a 
regulation or law containing a contradictory or nonsensical 
catch 
the catch22 is if the state did work on reviewing the plan 
without those funds being charged the state would be accused of 
supporting financially activities that were to the benefit of the 
company sununu said 
sununu who became bushs chief of staff in january after three 
terms as governor said he and carney worked very hard to make 
sure that we met both the letter and spirit of that law

sandy tribble and dorothy brinckerhoff are 
students of the force of habit 
by now theyve seen it often enough a car pulls onto the dusty 
gravel parking strip in front of their country store in alpine a 
crossroads about 25 miles northwest of eugene the driver gets out 
and shoves a coin in the lone parking meter out front 
it makes you wonder brinckerhoff says some of them never 
stop to notice that its the only meter there and they never even 
ask why there would be a meter in a place like alpine 
ok why after all alpine is an unincorporated town unsullied by 
sidewalks a city hall a police force or parking enforcers 
the idea surfaced a couple of years ago when tribble and 
brinckerhoff were at a meeting of the alpine community center the 
name given to a group that raises money to maintain the towns park 
at the meeting discussion turned to the recently erected stop 
signal at alpines downtown intersection that was progress it was 
agreed but maybe more was needed someone suggested a parking meter 
it started out as a joke but we kept talking about it 
tribble says we said we could take the money from a meter and use 
it to maintain the park 
someone called the town of corvallis which had a meter to spare 
and so the parking meter came to alpine where it sat for a couple 
years in a back room of the store it was erected out front a few 
weeks ago 
most local people think its a good joke and then they put 
money in it anyhow brinckerhoff said but a few people have 
been kind of indignant a parking meter in alpine they act like 
they moved to alpine to get away from things like that 
ironically the owners of the meter have no way to get to the 
money corvallis officials wouldnt part with the special key that 
opens the meter because they still have similar models on the 
streets of their city 
but meter technician ray baylor has volunteered to stop by every 
couple of months to empty the till

last weeks total lunar eclipse but maternity wards from miami to 
west palm beach reported a dramatic rise in births during and after 
the celestial phenomenon 
at miamis jackson memorial hospital where an average of 40 
births are handled a day 61 babies were born early thursday within 
hours of the eclipse and 17 babies about twice the daily average 
were born at plantation general hospital during the same period 
at mount sinai medical center in miami beach nine mothers gave 
birth shortly after the moon slid through the earths shadow that 
was triple the normal daily average 
births nearly doubled at south miami hospital and st marys 
hospital in west palm beach reported about seven more than usual 
they always say the tide has something to do with births 
said pat jamason a nursing supervisor at st marys so maybe the 
eclipse is responsible 
some doctors were skeptical 
i dont know where these things get started said dr debra 
kenwood a south miami gynecologist and obstetrician as far as i 
know theres no scientific proof to support it

hundreds of riot police used 
truncheons to disperse more than 4000 protesters who defied a ban 
on demonstrations monday marking the 21st anniversary of the 
sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia 
police detained dozens of demonstrators who marched through the 
center of old prague calling for democratic reform and the 
withdrawal of soviet troops 
the twohour rally started when a group of hungarian youths told 
a cheering crowd they disagreed with hungarys participation in the 
1968 invasion and then unfurled a banner reading the bolsheviks 
came with tanks we come with flowers 
many protesters were beaten by police but it was not known 
whether any were seriously injured it could not be determined how 
many demonstrators were detained 
austrian television said police cut one of its camera cables and 
then felled a crew member with what the correspondent described as a 
karate stroke 
the rally was smaller than a demonstration by 10000 people on 
aug 21 last year but occurred despite warnings by czechoslovak 
authorities that force would be used to break up any protests 
fearing bloodshed activists had warned against street protests 
the official ctk news agency said 1500 people took part in a 
provocation organized by hostile centers from abroad it 
said those detained would be punished according to czechoslovak 
law 
police sirens sounded through the area for hours after the 
protest began as vanloads of helmeted riot police and regular 
uniformed forces moved in to downtown prague 
the protest began at about 5 pm the hour appointed by six 
dissident groups for a twominute silent protest against the 
invasion 
the crowd gathered around the hungarian activists at the lower 
end of wenceslas square a long boulevard in central prague and 
shouted mockingly gorbachev sees this as riot police moved in 
they referred to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
you must know that hungarian youth never agreed with the 
invasion hungarian activist gyorgy kereniy shouted to applause 
and chants of long live hungary 
plainclothes police barged through the crowd and detained kereniy 
as they moved from wenceslas square to old town square and the 
federal government headquarters where they were turned back by 
police the demonstrators chanted long live poland and 
russians go home 
they also shouted support for alexander dubcek the leader of the 
prague spring reforms crushed by the 1968 invasion 
dubcek who was ousted as party leader in april 1969 and expelled 
from communist ranks in 1970 has called for fresh reforms and 
rehabilitation of the half a million communists expelled after 1968 
pragues communist leadership has resisted mounting pressure at 
home and from east bloc reformers for the political changes under 
way in poland hungary and the soviet union 
authorities had warned against demonstrations this year 
harassing and detaining leading dissidents and mounting a tight 
security operation for the past two days in prague 
most wellknown dissidents were warned weeks in advance to stay 
out of prague and other big cities for the anniversary two who 
stayed in the capital charter 77 spokeswoman dana nemcova and her 
son david were placed under house arrest on sunday 
activists recommended czechoslovaks sign a petition for 
democratic reforms instead of holding street protests fearing 
police would shoot demonstrators 
on monday the staterun media ran no commentary of their own on 
the invasion anniversary limiting their reporting to comments from 
other warsaw pact states that participated in the intervention 
a polish parliamentary resolution said the invasion was a 
violation of international law and on monday lawmakers from 
polands solidarity movement led a rally in the border town of 
cieszyn 
never again brotherly help read a banner carried by 
protesters according to polands state pap news agency 
leaders of hungarys communist party said last week they did not 
agree with the invasion on sunday hungarian premier miklos nemeth 
said his country has initiated steps within the warsaw pact to make 
military interference impossible in the future 
in washington the state department issued a statement saying 
it is our hope that czechoslovakia will recall the events of 
1968 and will display a greater tolerance for freedom of 
expression and assembly

voyager 2 fired its thrusters monday in a 
delicate maneuver to bring it closer to neptunes mysterious moon 
triton then it searched for northern lights over neptune and 
snapped pictures of its turbulent storms 
one of two partial rings called ring arcs discovered earlier 
this month by voyager has not been seen in subsequent photographs 
leading scientists on a search for the lost arc said bradford 
smith the head of the voyager imaging team which analyzes the 
spacecrafts photographs 
scientists expect to find many ring arcs as they get closer to 
the planet and to obtain very detailed photographs of them smith 
said in a press briefing at nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
scientists issued their first weather forecast for neptune 
predicting fairly accurately on aug 13 where neptunes great dark 
spot an earthsized cyclone would be found sunday 
its not perfect but weather forecasting isnt a perfect 
science smith said 
the length of a day on neptune the time the planet takes to 
spin on its axis was estimated to be 16 hours based on 
observations of intense bursts of radio waves from the planets 
magnetic field which varies with its rotation previous estimates 
had put the day length at 17 or 18 hours 
voyager has so far discovered four new moons around neptune 
bringing the total to six 
the course correction executed monday didnt use voyagers main 
thrusters but two tiny thrusters that kept the spacecraft pointed 
in the right direction to remain in communication with earth the 
smaller thrusters also avoided heating that could have disrupted a 
radio receiver that partly malfunctioned a year after voyager was 
launched in 1977 
it was the first time such a maneuver had ever been performed 
the researchers said 
use of the main engine could have put mission controllers out of 
touch with the spacecraft for up to two days said norman haynes 
voyager project manager the controllers couldnt risk that with the 
spacecrafts closest encounter with neptune set for thursday at 855 
pm pdt 
the spaceship will pass 3000 miles from neptune and about 
24000 miles from triton five hours later the course correction 
will bring the spacecraft 439 miles closer to triton and will allow 
better observations of any rings arcs and of the atmospheres of 
neptune and triton 
the latest pictures of triton show the moon is brighter cooler 
and only about half the size scientists previously thought smith 
said its diameter is now estimated at 1740 miles about 
fourfifths the size of earths moon 
the pictures show dark spots near tritons equator and a pinkish 
cast that may be from discolored frozen natural gas or methane 
falling to the moons surface as a sludge smith said 
triton is a most intriguing moon orbiting neptune in a 
backward direction according to voyager project scientist edward 
stone that suggests it may have been a giant comet that smacked 
into some other moon of neptune then became trapped into orbit 
around the planet 
at 9 am pdt tuesday voyager will be 274 billion miles from 
earth and 229 million miles from neptune with a speed relative to 
neptune of 37697 mph 
voyagers schedule of activities monday including searching for 
aurora or northern lights near neptunes north pole making 36 
photographs of neptune to study its weather 24 pictures of triton 
29 pictures of the moon nereid and several photos of the recently 
discovered moon designated 1989 n1 
last week voyager found evidence neptune has a magnetic field 
suggesting it should also have auroral lights as electrically 
charged particles are sucked toward its magnetic poles 
the probe also was programmed to take 39 pictures of the region 
in which partial rings of debris may be orbiting the planet 
pictures taken monday were being recorded on tape aboard voyager 
for transmission back to earth later in the week 
voyagers monday schedule also included using an infrared sensor 
to study composition of neptunes atmosphere

the full district of columbia court of appeals 
on monday overturned an appeals panels order to end the nearly 
twoyear jailing of elizabeth morgan for refusing to reveal the 
whereabouts of her daughter in a bitter custody dispute 
the full court in an order issued shortly after a threejudge 
panel ruled 21 that morgan should be released called for a new 
hearing on her appeal of the civil contempt of court citation that 
has kept her at the city jail 
the court did not explain its onepage order 
the prominent plastic surgeon has been jailed since aug 28 1987 
by superior court judge herbert dixon for failing to produce her 
daughter hilary for visits with eric foretich her former husband 
and the girls father

abused the child foretich who is also a doctor denies the charges 
hilary whose seventh birthday was monday remains hidden 
in mondays majority opinion by the threejudge panel judge john 
m ferren said dixons attempt to coerce ms morgan into divulging 
the girls whereabouts had failed 
irrespective of context once the civil contempt power is shown 
to have failed in its intended purpose the court must release 
the contemnor from jail ferren wrote 
elaine mittleman attorney for foretich said new arguments have 
been scheduled for sept 20 
earlier monday foretich was joined on the capitol steps by about 
a dozen relatives and supporters to mark his daughters seventh 
birthday 
foretich said he decided to hold the ceremony because he is upset 
about legislation pending in congress which would lead to morgans 
release even if she doesnt bring the child out of hiding 
meanwhile foretich has filed a 220 million suit against the cbs 
television network and six other defendants in connection with the 
program people magazine on tv broadcast aug 16 which carried a 
story about the custody dispute

several candidates for the cabinet of 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani announced new policies monday 
while waiting for parliament to confirm their appointments 
irans official islamic republic news agency said iranian 
newspapers had published the programs of 14 of the 22 ministerial 
candidates 
confirmation debate is to begin saturday in the 270member 
majlis irans parliament 
rafsanjani appointed a frenchtrained former justice minister 
hassan habibi on monday as his first vice president he chose a 
former deputy prime minister ataollah mohajerani as vice president 
for judicial and parliamentary affairs 
habibi is among a small group of westernoriented officials 
selected by rafsanjani to help rebuild the economy and restore ties 
with the west 
the new president is trying to promote moderate educated 
technocrats and remove hardliners from key positions where they 
could block his policies 
among the hardliners are interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
prime minister hussein musavi and intelligence minister mohammad 
reyshahri none of whom is included in the rafsanjani cabinet the 
job of prime minister was abolished in the new constitution which 
created a strong presidency 
reyshari who declined to serve in rafsanjanis government was 
named prosecutorgeneral monday by the head of the judiciary 
mohammad ali yazdi he selected morteza moqtadai as chief justice 
mohsen nourbakhsh who was educated in the united states and has 
been chosen as economy minister wants a complete review of 
irans foreign exchange policies the official news agency reported 
it said nourbakhsh a former central bank governor would 
increase exports other than oil which now provide only 10 percent 
of foreign currency earnings in order to reduce a chronic trade 
deficit 
imports have contributed to soaring inflation which has made 
tehran one of the worlds most expensive cities 
while at the bank nourbakhsh held inflation to a 20 percent 
annual rate by tight controls on the money supply he resigned 
because of opposition to his plans however and inflation quickly 
rose to 50 percent 
nourbakhsh also called for a stable tax policy that would 
encourage medium and longterm investment in industry irna said 
abdolhassan vahaji rafsanjanis choice as commerce minister 
hinted at a larger role for the private sector the agency quoted 
him as saying he planned to revive traditional supply networks 
and hand over the unnecessary part of the governments 
responsibilities in distribution affairs to other sectors 
vahaji also promised to stabilize governmentsubsidized prices of 
basic goods 
virtually all trade has been conducted by the government 
creating a bureaucracy with little regard for market factors 
another of rafsanjanis priorities is to convince skilled 
iranians driven abroad by the islamic revolutions excesses to 
return home 
mostafa moin candidate for higher education minister said he 
would attract prominent world scholars to iranian universities 
by offering material and spiritual incentives irna said 
it quoted moin as saying he would build more universities and 
improve standards 
standards at iranian universities have fallen in the 10 years of 
the fundamentalist islamic regime entrance requirements reflect 
ideology as much as academic achievement 
iraj fazel proposed minister of health wants to improve medical 
training by bring topquality academics back from exile the agency

a package holding what appeared to be a teargas 
bomb was mailed to the southeastern regional headquarters of the 
naacp and spewed gas throughout an office building when it was 
opened monday injuring eight people 
civil rights leaders denounced the attack as apparently racist 
federal officials said they will investigate to see if civil rights 
violations were involved 
a caustic gas similar to tear gas spread from the naacp 
office through airconditioning ducts into surrounding offices in 
the twostory building just southwest of downtown atlanta said 
assistant fire chief walter campbell 
the eight injured people taken to two downtown hospitals 
included a 4monthold infant and a 12yearold no one was 
seriously hurt said officials at grady memorial hospital and 
georgia baptist medical center at least five of the injured were 
able to go home within a few hours 
two staff members in the national association for the advancement 
of colored people office when the bomb went off regional executive 
director earl t shinhoster and secretary murlene murray fled and 
were not seriously hurt apart from burning eyes and throats ms 
murray said 
this is just a terrible experience she added weve never 
experienced anything like this before in the 20 years ive worked 
here 
this is a very evil and dastardly act shinhoster said i 
dont know why anyone would want to try to hurt innocent people like 
this 
the package no bigger than a hat box arrived via postal 
service priority mail shinhoster said it was addressed to the 
naacp and not to anyone in particular 
the return address listed a law office and a location but im 
sure it was fictitious ms murray said she did not recall a 
specific name on the return address 
shinhoster said he and ms murray opened the package just after 
noon and immediately saw sparks two loud pops were then heard and a 
cylinder in the package began emitting a whiteyellow caustic smoke 
shinhoster said 
the package remained largely intact 
officers from the postal service the fbi city police and the 
city fire bureau arson squad were investigating campbell said 
well be looking to see what jurisdiction if any weve got 
said fbi agent diader rosario our interest is from the point of 
view of civil rights 
mayor andrew young urged city employees to be careful when 
handling any mail that might look suspicious 
us rep john lewis dga was in the neighborhood speaking to 
a community group when he heard about the incident and went to the 
scene 
anytime something like this would come to the naacp office you 
have to believe its racially motivated said lewis a veteran of 
the civil rights movement 
i think theres a climate existing in america now he said 
twentyfive years later the seeds of racism are raising their ugly 
heads again

the organization of american states on monday 
declared its solidarity with colombia in the face of a criminal 
aggression by drug lords 
the oas permanent council acted three days after the 
assassination friday of luis carlos galan a leading candidate in 
next years presidential election in colombia 
latin american diplomats said they regarded colombias request 
for a special meeting of the oas as aimed at pressuring the united 
states for more action to crack down on drug use 
it also was seen as intended to neutralize any potential 
criticism for the declared state of siege under which the 
colombian government has rounded up 10000 people suspected to have 
links with the drug cartels 
leopoldo villar borda the colombian representative to the oas 
called the situation extremely serious but ruled out any 
request for us troops to help in countering the drug cartels 
accused of engineering galans killing 
the colombians have long held that if the us market were to dry 
up the cartels production and influence would decline 
the resolution appoved by the oas pointedly reversed the usual 
word order and condemned the use traffic and production of 
drugs stressing the need for the united states to reduce 
consumption 
current us estimates indicate colombia produces some 85 per 
cent of the 110 billion in drugs used in the united states a year 
colombian president virgilio barco vargas said in bogota that 
whoever consumes drugs should remember that he is helping those 
who assasinated galan 
in his speech before the oas villar borda said of colombia that 
no country has paid so high a price for the traffic created by an 
insatiable demand for drugs 
villar borda reacted with incredulity when asked by reporters if 
colombia was prepared to ask for us troops to crack down the drugs 
cartels he bushed aside the question with a firm no 
john sununu white house chief of staff said that there has been 
no specific request by colombia for the use of us troops 
the issue was raised sunday by attorney general dick thornburgh 
when he said the united states should consider sending troops if 
requested to help colombia in its fight against the drugs cartels

the army said monday its soldiers were not 
involved in the death of a 14yearold palestinianamerican whose 
body was found last week near ramallah in the occupied west bank 
the family of amjad jibril tawil claimed he was in army custody 
after a stonethrowing incident wednesday and that his body was 
found friday with bruises burn marks and a fatal bullet wound in 
the chest 
bethlehem mayor elias freij said he had filed a complaint with 
israeli authorities about the death of another young palestinian 
allegedly was shot and killed saturday in the biblical town by 
security forces masquerading as tourists 
the army declined comment on freijs allegations 
arab reports said three palestinians were killed monday in 
confrontations with soldiers 
fourteen palestinians were shot and wounded in stonethrowing 
clashes with israeli troops during a general strike called by 
leaders of the 20monthold uprising in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip hospital officials said 
the army confirmed two deaths and four wounded 
the deaths raised to at least 543 the number of palestinians 
killed by israeli troops and settlers since the uprising against 
israeli rule began in december 1987 ninetyseven palestinians have 
been killed by fellow arabs and 38 israelis have died 
based on a reconstruction of events by an investigator and a 
government autopsy of the tawil case the army said the 
conclusion is that the death of the boy was not caused by the 
israeli security forces 
the statement did not say who was suspected of killing tawil who 
was born in denver colo nor did it give details of the autopsy 
it said police were investigating 
the family filed a petition monday with the supreme court 
demanding the tawils body not be reburied until an independent 
autopsy could be performed the body was exhumed over the weekend 
for the israeli autopsy 
lawyer leah tsemel who filed the petition said the action was 
taken after the government reneged on an earlier pledge to allow an 
independent pathologist to observe the governments autopsy 
ms tsemel said she also asked the court to order the army to 
lift its blockade of the tawil home only family members and 
representatives of the us consulate have been allowed in the 
house she said 
his family reported the boy missing thursday they said he went 
to pray at a ramallah mosque wednesday and a stonethrowing incident 
developed after the prayer service 
relatives said they were told by other palestinians that he was 
in army custody but the army denied he ever was held 
the human rights group alhaq based in ramallah issued a 
statement saying there was the possibility of official involvement 
in the youths death and asked for an independent investigation 
into the youths death 
a military source who insisted on anonymity said the fatal 
bullet apparently was from a pistol fired at close range 
in the west bank two palestinian teenagers were shot to death 
in a stonethrowing clash with israeli troops in the village of el 
ram near jerusalem hospital officials said 
doctors at mukaseed hospital in arab east jerusalem identified 
them as wadia mahmoud salah 15 and hussein adnan herbawi 14 
in tekua near bethlehem an 18yearold palestinian was fatally 
shot in the chest arab reports said israel radio said he was fired 
on from a passing car but arab witnesses later said the youth was 
shot after a clash with troops they identified him as sani mahmoud 
atwa sabbah 
in jerusalem the managing editor of the arabiclanguage 
newspaper alfajr newspaper was arrested and placed under a 
sixmonth administrative detention said israel television and 
reporters from the newspaper

gen michel aoun proposed peace talks 
monday but a syrianbacked moslem militia rejected the offer to 
negotiate an end to the 5monthold artillery duel with aouns 
christian forces that has killed hundreds 
there was no response to aouns proposal from the syrian forces 
in lebanon since 1976 
i am ready any time to discuss lebanons future at a 
roundtable with leaders of the other side aoun said in an 
interview published by the parisbased arabic magazine koll elarab 
his press office confirmed the quote was accurate 
aoun made no mention of his previous condition that 
christianmoslem negotiations on political reforms could not be held 
until syria pulled its 40000 troops out of lebanon 
druse leader walid jumblatts progressive socialist party 
dismissed the offer as a trick to allow aoun a breathing spell to 
rearm and remartial his forces 
in a statement jumblatt said aoun would never be accepted as a 
negotiator asserting that a moslemchristian dialogue can begin 
only after the butcher is overthrown and brought to trial for his 
crimes 
the statement also condemned the arrival of french warships off 
lebanon and said president francois mitterrands government wants 
to kindle a new crusaders war in lebanon france ruled the 
country from the end of world war i till independence in 1943 
syrian vice president abdulhalim khaddam reiterated his 
countrys determination to take all measures to guarantee the 
unity of lebanon but made no reference to aouns offer 
khaddam told a meeting of syrias ruling baath socialist 
partynational entente is the safe way to end the lebanese 
crisis syria will assist all patriotic lebanese to estabish 
a democratic system in which all lebanese have equal rights and 
duties 
he did not criticize france by name but spoke of western 
involvement that had negative repercussions of further 
complicating the lebanese crisis 
saudi arabias king fahd said monday that lebanons christian and 
moslem leaders must start cooperating if a settlement is to be 
reached in lebanons civil war that began in 1975 syria sent its 
troops into lebanon originally as a peacekeeping force in 1976 
fahds statement ended speculation that he was about to resume a 
mediation bid he undertook along with king hassan ii of morocco and 
president chadlin bendjedid of algeria the arab league negotiators 
announced on aug 1 their efforts were deadlocked over syrias 
refusal to withdraw its troops 
aoun calls the syrians an occupation army and has declared a 
war of liberation against them 
all radio stations broadcast aouns offer as his 20000 soldiers 
exchanged sporadic artillery and tank fire with the syrians across 
divided beirut and in the hills above the capital 
police reported one person killed and 14 wounded 
by police count 785 people have been killed and 2140 wounded 
since the latest fighting began march 8 between aouns soldiers and 
an alliance of syrians and moslem militias most casualties have

council passed a resolution on aug 15 calling for a ceasefire

byblos with 100 shells and rockets overnight to turn back three 
ships carrying food to the 310squaremile christian enclave 
aouns forces have been receiving weapons from iraq syrias main 
arab foe 
in sidon south lebanon a freighter that had smuggled food to 
the christians was blown up by three bombs at dawn monday police 
said three other freighters were wrecked by similar explosions in 
june 
beirut media said monday the french warships were intended to 
break the syrian siege of the christian heartland 
annahar an independent newspaper quoted sources as saying the 
flotilla would ensure that arms and fuel supplies reached the 
christians 
last week the french sent an aircraft carrier a destroyer a 
hospital ship and a fuel tanker ostensibly to help evacuate french 
citizens if necessary about 7000 french nationals live in lebanon 
the annahar report quoted a highranking source as saying 
france is just giving a humanitarian excuse for its upcoming 
military intervention 
rene ala the french ambassador said monday he assured acting 
prime minister salim hoss that france is not contemplating 
intervention hoss heads a moslem cabinet that competes with a 
christian government led by aoun

the settlement of a telephone strike in california and nevada 
appeared to give new impetus monday to efforts to resolve similar 
strikes elsewhere around the country 
a communications workers of america union leader in indianapolis 
said he was optimistic that the pacific telesis agreement would lead 
to a settlement at ameritech which serves five midwestern states 
there also were hopeful signs in philadelphia where negotiations 
continued between workers and management at bell atlantic which 
covers the midatlantic states and washington dc 
mary ohara an adminstrative assistant for the cwa said union 
officials have still got hope of meeting a deadline to resolve 
the issues with bell atlantic by midnight tuesday both sides agreed 
to the deadline 
more vandalism was reported in the strike against nynex which 
serves new york and the northeast a judge in albany ny issued a 
temporary injunction ordering strikers not to engage in mass 
striking or interfere with operations at new york telephone a nynex 
subsidiary 
the three continuing strikes involve more than 150000 workers

pacific telesis after negotiators reached agreement over the weekend 
the pacific telesis agreement will raise salaries by 11 percent 
over three years according to jessie wilson president of cwa local 
9415 
some tension was reported monday as strikers returned to work 
alongside those who had remained on the job during the twoweek 
strike 
theyre not talking to us one directory assistance operator 
said of the returning strikers im a very mildmannered person i 
just ignore them 
in indiana cwa spokesman l keith dooley said he thought the 
pacific telesis contract could serve as a guide for negotiations 
betwee the union and ameritech 
i havent seen their package yet but i think that could have 
some affect on what goes on here dooley said 
both cwa and ameritech officials said they were willing to go 
back to the bargaining table although neither side expressed a 
willingness to pick up the telephone 
if we get a call from the company were certainly available

instructs the cwa to have no more than 10 pickets at an entrance to 
a new york telephone building in addition pickets must remain at 
least 15 feet away from company vehicles and employees and cannot 
vandalize company equipment he said 
but striking union members said they had been advised by their 
attorneys that kahn had no jurisdiction over the matter and that 
they could carry on with their picketing as usual 
essentially it means nothing said william sullivan 
president of local 1126 in utica ny 
there were at least 13 incidents of vandalism to new york 
telephone lines last weekend causing phone service outages to more

the rich and ruthless leaders of the 
cocaine underworld often have shown they will go to any lengths to 
protect their billiondollar business 
last weeks killing of sen luis carlos galan the top 
presidential candidate and acknowledged leader of a new political 
generation was the latest example 
the governments reaction was vigorous but again illustrated its 
inability to catch the drug lords soldiers and police raided their 
estates and arrested thousands of employees and underlings but did 
not find the bosses 
their names are well known pablo escobar gonzalo rodriguez 
gacha and the brothers jorge fabio and juan david ochoa vasquez 
said to lead the medellin cartel based in the northwestern 
industrial city 
escobar is on fortune magazines list of the worlds 20 richest 
men said to have more than 3 billion 
in cali a southwestern city a rival cartel operates under the 
leadership of gilberto rodriguez orejuela and hernan santacruz 
londono according to authorities 
the two groups are reported to be warring over the new york city 
drug market about 200 members of the rival cartels have been 
reported killed in 18 months and scores of properties in medellin 
and cali have been bombed or shot up 
profits from new york drug sales are estimated at 35 billion a 
year said gen jaime ruiz barrera who spent two years as the 
military commander of medellin 
ruiz barrera recently was sent to washington as military attache 
in an effort to protect him from killers hired by the cocaine 
barons assassinations attributed to them have occurred as far away 
as baton rouge la and hungary 
colombian drug cartels are said to have financed the training of 
2000 hired assassins in association with extreme rightwing groups 
the assassins are blamed for the deaths of galan and many before him 
cartel killers have terrorized the courts they are blamed for 
the deaths of a justice minister an attorney general and 220 judges 
and judicial aides since 1981 said judge antonio morales president 
of the national judicial employees association 
such bloody intimidation has kept the cartel bosses out of jail 
and shielded them from what they fear most extradition to the 
united states 
only one top dealer madellin cartel partner carlos lehder has 
been captured and shipped to the united states handed over in 1987 
he was convicted by a florida court last year and sentenced to life 
in prison 
military and police forces occasionally deliver a painful blow to 
the dealers destroying expensive laboratories and seizing fortunes 
in drugs so far this year authorities have confiscated 26 tons of 
cocaine but that is considered only a small part of total 
production

a florida man said monday that he and 
his wife who survived 66 days adrift on a life raft menaced by 
sharks tried to signal more than three dozen passing ships before 
one spotted them 
william butler 59 said he and his wife simone 56 of miami 
survived on raw fish and purified water until a costa rican coast 
guard boat picked them up in the pacific ocean 12 miles off the 
coast on saturday 
we were surrounded by sharks practically all the time and we 
felt a lot of panic but thanks to god they never attacked us 
butler an electrical engineer said by telephone from a hospital in 
the port of golfito 
he said he and his wife set sail from panama on may 24 for hawaii 
in their 40foot sloop the siboney they had been drifting east in 
the life raft since june 15 when whales attacked their boat about 
1200 miles southwest of costa rica he said 
in no more than 15 minutes our boat was destroyed he said 
but god always present in our prayers helped us because we 
carried a life raft and we got in it immediately taking all the 
things we would need 
they had eight cans of food some cookies a water purifier and a 
fishing hook butler said 
after 20 days adrift all the food was gone he said then 
we started to fish thanks to god we always had food and with the 
filter we drank fresh water 
before they got in the raft he said he sent three distress 
messages over the radio but no one heard them 
at least 40 ships passed and didnt see us and every night we 
thought we could die he said but the next day in the morning 
we prayed again 
egbert vallecillo a us coast guard spokesman said butler told 
him by telephone that the sharks punctured the raft several times 
and the couple sealed the holes with a repair kit 
vallecillo said he spoke to butler from the us coast guards 
pacific command headquarters in alameda 10 miles east of san 
francisco 
in san jose butler said he and his wife were praying again 
saturday afternoon when they saw the costa rican coast guard boat 
but they saw us first he said 
they were picked up 20 miles off punta burica at the border with 
panama and near golfito 200 miles southeast of san jose 
butler lost 49 of his 175 pounds and his wife dropped from 150 
pounds to 92 he said 
but we are in pretty good shape because we had food all the 
time and the doctor at the hospital in golfito said we can return to 
miami next monday he said 
butler a cubanamerican came to the united states from cuba in 
1960 he has two children who live in miami 
it was a happy ending he said im going home to miami 
ill buy another boat and will sail again

the us government and the tuna fishing 
industry warned monday that us trade would be hurt and dolphins 
would gain little if observers were required to monitor 
dolphinkilling by every foreign tuna boat 
a lawyer for environmental groups told a federal judge that us 
law requires foreignowned tuna boats selling to the united states 
to meet the same standard as domestic boats an observer on every 
boat to monitor and prevent needless killing of dolphins during tuna 
fishing 
but lawyers for the government and the domestic industry 
disagreed 
congress recognized that immediate compliance for the foreign 
fleets would be impossible justice department lawyer charles 
brooks told us district judge thelton henderson 
brooks contended the law allowed commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher to determine that only onethird of the foreign boats had 
to carry observers this year federal law forbids the united states 
to buy tuna products from any nation that violates the observer 
standards 
if 100 percent coverage were required foreign fleets would 
simply stop selling their tuna to us companies and trade instead 
with other nations that do not regulate dolphinkilling said david 
burney lawyer for the us tuna foundation an industry group 
such a requirement would precipitously cause these nations to 
abandon their participation in the only program that exists to 
protect the dolphins martin hochman lawyer for the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration told reporters 
henderson said he would rule in several days on whether the law 
requires every foreign boat to carry an observer 
in january the judge issued an injunction requiring all us 
tuna boats to carry observers rejecting the governments argument 
that a budget shortage justified a reduction in observer coverage 
hochman said congress later approved the money needed for complete 
coverage 
the dolphins which swim above yellowfin tuna are killed when 
caught in nets cast to catch tuna below the surface the observers 
are there to see that boats comply with a law requiring use of the 
best available technology to avoid needless killings 
brooks the governments lawyer agreed with environmental groups 
that foreign boats kill more dolphins but he said not enough money 
and trained observers are available for 100 percent coverage of the 
foreign boats brooks argued that onethird of the boats was a large 
enough sample to tell whether the fleet was complying with us laws 
however joshua flom lawyer for the earth island institute and 
the marine mammal fund said congress had rejected the same argument 
as a justification for less than 100percent observer coverage of 
us tuna boats 
boats behave very differently if they have an observer on 
board flom said why would congress require something more 
extensive for the domestic fleet than for the foreign fleet

two congressmen said monday they are deeply 
disturbed by justice department plans to crack down on leaks by 
prosecuting government officials and subpoenaing reporters 
telephone records 
you are invoking the statute on theft of government property 
which really has nothing to do with leaks reps don edwards 
dcalif and charles schumer dny said in a letter to attorney 
general dick thornburgh 
congress has not adopted a criminal statute for leaks and 
certainly never intended the theft of property law to be used in 
this way they wrote 
edwards is chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on civil 
and constitutional rights and schumer chairs the subcommittee on 
criminal justice 
thornburgh on sunday said subpoenaing reporters telephone 
records was constitutional he had said on aug 3 he wouldnt 
prosecute reporters who obtain news leaks about criminal 
investigations but could charge federal officials who are their 
sources with stealing government property 
the statute clearly calls for prosecution of those involved in 
misusing sensitive information that comes to them in an official 
capacity said thornburgh 
the departments reversal of an 11yearold policy that was 
intended to protect whistleblowers and reporters from prosecution 
was announced the previous day in testimony submitted to congress 
the congressmen said they were deeply disturbed by the 
departments decision to seek criminal sanctions against government 
employees who leak information and were opposed to forcing 
reporters to disclose their sources through compulsory process or 
subpoenas for reporters telephone records 
a source speaking on condition of anonymity said monday that 
the department had considered subpoenaing the telephone records of 
cbstv reporter rita braver who reported earlier this year that an 
fbi investigation involved rep william gray dpa 
stories about gray abounded during the house democratic 
leadership election and the justice department took the unusual step 
of announcing he was not the subject of an investigation gray was 
elected house democratic whip 
fbi agents interviewed department officials about the leak and at 
least one official testified before a grand jury 
cbs learned several weeks ago about the plan to subpoena bravers 
phone records before it happened and confronted the department 
said the source 
tom goodman a spokesman for the network in new york said the 
records had not been subpoenaed 
justice department spokesman dan eramian declined to comment on 
the issue

the bush administration is reviewing a list of 
up to 100 colombians to decide which might be targeted for 
extradition on drug charges now that colombian president virgilio 
barco vargas has said such extraditions will resume a us official 
said monday 
the exact number under review remains unclear said drug 
enforcement administration spokesman frank shults who said only 
that there are 50 to 100 names on the list being scrutinized 
there are lists of people for whom indictments have been 
processed in the united states some of them going back a number of 
years shults said we in conjunction with the justice 
department are reviewing those lists and making an assessment about 
the currency of the evidence the availability of information 
on another front officials who spoke on condition they not be 
identified said the united states was preparing to send a small team 
of police experts to columbia to advise judges magistrates and 
journalists many of whom have been killed by drug gangs on how to 
improve security 
the 5 million program was approved by congress over a year ago 
and this is not anything new said one official 
attorney general dick thornburgh said sunday that the united 
states wants about a dozen colombian drug kingpins sent to the 
united states to face trial 
all the biggies are on the list of colombians the united 
states would like to gave extradited shults said including the 
leaders of the medellin carter jose rodriguez gacha 41 pablo 
escobar 39 and jorge luis ochoa 39 
the colombian government announced that 10000 people had been 
arrested in major sweeps including raids of properties of suspected 
drug traffickers but there was no report if the leaders of the 
medellin or cali cocaine cartels had been among them 
one former cartel leader carlos lehder was extradited to the 
united states in 1987 before the colombian supreme court struck 
down the extradition treaty lehder is now in federal prison in 
marion ill serving a life sentence without parole plus 135 years 
the united states had been pressuring colombia to resume 
extraditions particularly of the cartel leadership and barco on 
saturday decreed measures that would allow alleged drug traffickers 
to be extradited summarily to the united states for trial 
barcos move was triggered by the friday assassination of leading 
colombian president candidate luis carlos galan an outspoken foe of 
the drug leaders 
shults said it was premature to speculate on whether the dea 
would send more agents to colombia beefing up the force of two 
dozen agents there now to help locate alleged drug traffickers 
wanted on charges in the united states 
the dea doesnt know where they all are and isnt sure exactly 
how barcos announced willingness to extradite them to the united 
states to stand trial will work out 
a lot remains to be seen shults said we know basically 
that president barco has made this overture but the specifics 
havent come forth yet we stand ready to help however we can 
meanwhile the dea is concerned about the safety of its agents in 
colombia but is not planning to pull anyone out as it has done in 
other countries when violence threatens to overwhelm them

the navy failed to properly qualify the 
sailors who worked in the battleship uss iowas no 2 turret when it 
exploded last april a newspaper reported monday 
navy regulations require that all sailors and civilian navy 
employees who work with explosives must first be certified by a 
qualification board at their posts sailors who lack board 
certification are permitted to handle the weapons only in the 
presence of a supervisor 
michael drowns one of 11 sailors who escaped turret no 2 after 
the april 19 explosion told the daily press of newport news that a 
qualification board was never convened on the iowa during his three 
years on the ship 
drowns left the ship aug 1 in preparation for leaving the navy 
with a dishonorable discharge aug 11 
other iowa sailors and a navy officer familiar with the iowa 
investigation confirmed drowns statements to the daily press but 
they asked that they not be identified for fear of retribution by 
the navy 
adm richard milligan who headed the navys probe of the 
explosion said no records of a qualification board had been found 
on the iowa one of the sources told the newspaper milligan has 
declined to comment publicly on the probe 
lt kevin wensing said monday the report on the explosion is in 
the hands of navy officials but has not been released to the 
public wensing said he could not comment further 
although many of the sailors who worked in the no 2 turret had 
completed basic technical training in a school none had been 
qualified by a qualification board drowns and other sources said 
drowns and another turret no 2 survivor gunners mate 2nd class 
john mullahy said that before the explosions the turrets senior 
enlisted man senior chief gunners mate reginald o ziegler was 
concerned about the lack of qualification booklets 
ziegler one of the 47 sailors who died in the blast had given 
photocopied pages of the performance qualification standard booklets 
to some sailors navy regulations require that sailors have the 
books 
mullahy and a third iowa survivor gunners mate 3rd class 
kendall truitt said one of the sailors who lacked a book was 
gunners mate 3rd class robert w backherms the rammerman of the 
center gun where the explosion occurred truitt said backherms 
joined the ship shortly after christmas was inexperienced and may 
have caused the blasts by ramming the bags of explosives into the 
gun too fast 
last month nbc news reported that navy investigators believed 
the explosion was the result of suicidal sabotage by gunners mate 
clayton hartwig navy spokesman lt greg smith said july 19 the 
conclusion of suicide was not based on official navy reports 
retired rear adm eugene carroll jr told the daily press he 
suspected that a decision on whether to convene a qualification 
board depends on the commanding officer 
carroll deputy director of the center for defense information a 
private think tank in washington said the regulation probably is 
followed as much as a regulation requiring paperwork on preventive 
maintenance 
the degree of adherence ranged from very very low to very 
very strict carroll said i would almost expect you could say 
the same thing about the performance qualification process

energy secretary james d watkins on monday 
offered to negotiate with 11 governors over state environmental 
monitoring of federal nuclear facilities within their borders 
the states are california ohio florida idaho missouri 
nevada new mexico south carolina tennessee texas and washington 
they are hosts to a variety of energy department defense nuclear 
facilities including nuclear reactors processing plants weapons 
assembly facilities and waste treatment and storage operations 
the department said it wanted to reach agreements that would 
allow the states to independently validate the departments own 
environmental monitoring data and to involve the states in setting 
priorities and schedules for nuclear waste cleanup 
this further reiterates the commitment of admiral watkins 
to achieve full accountability in the areas of environment safety 
and health and to restore the publics confidence in does ability 
to operate its facilities safely said henson moore the deputy 
energy secretary 
moore said the proposed agreements would be unprecedented in 
their scope and in the degree of access to doe facilities that will 
be provided to the states 
he said the accords would be similar to a model agreement signed 
june 28 by watkins and colorado gov roy romer over state access to 
the rocky flats nuclear plant near denver 
washington state also has a formal agreement with the energy 
department on participation on cleanup at the federal hanford 
nuclear reservation near richland 
moore said the proposed new agreements would supplement any 
existing accords so that each state is afforded an adequate level 
of onsite handson monitoring capability 
the reagan administration had vigorously opposed actions by 
states to enforce hazardous waste laws at defense nuclear 
facilities but president bush has taken a more accomodating 
approach in the wake of disclosures about mismanagement and possible 
criminal violations of environmental laws at some of the plants

eight invalids who said they 
were guerrillas suffering from war wounds have occupied the roman 
catholic cathedral to press their demand for the evacuation of rebel 
casualties 
a dozen civilian supporters accompanied the invalids who remained 
in the cathedral after sundays service 
carlos chavez who said his right leg was amputated after he was 
wounded in combat last year spoke with the associated press monday 
on the cathedral steps 
draped across the main entrance was a banner reading fmln 
those are the initials of the farabundo marti national liberation 
front a coalition of leftist guerrillas groups that have battling 
the government for nearly 10 years 
we intend to stay here until evacuation is arranged for us and 
for all the fmln war wounded said chavez 
president alfredo cristiani said monday the issue of the 
evacuation of rebel wounded could not be resolved until peace talks 
are held 
evacuation of wounded is a subject that must be dealt with in 
the overall dialogue cristiani told journalists 
both the government and the fmln have declared in recent weeks a 
willingness to join in another round of peace talks but no 
arrangements have been made 
there have been four rounds of negotiations since 1984 but none 
produced progress towar ending the war that has taken the lives of 
an estimated 70000 people with most of the victims civilians 
chavez said he did not know how many wounded rebels were awaiting 
treatment 
last may the previous government of president jose napoleon 
duarte authorized the transfer out of el salvador of 109 wounded 
guerrillas 
but that evacuation was not carried out because of disagreements 
between duartes centrist christian democrats and cristianis 
rightwing republican nationalist alliance or arena 
nearly 350 wounded guerrillas have been evacuated since 1984 
with most taken to cuba via mexico the last evacuation occurred in 
may 1988 
monsignor arturo rivera damas the archbishop of san salvador 
told reporters that evacuation of the wounded was one of the 
elements of humanizing the conflict that should be resumed he 
said the church was willing to mediate arrangements to conduct 
evacuations

a federal appeals court ordered a new trial monday 
for a defendant in a 12yearold pornography case that fell apart 
when an fbi agent became mentally unbalanced 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals upheld a lower courts 
ruling that theodore rothstein was entitled to a new trial on 
federal pornography and obscenity convictions arising from a 1977 
fbi undercover operation in miami fla 
according to court documents fbi agents patrick livingston and 
bruce ellavsky posed as pornographers in 1977 their efforts netted 
indictments against 16 people including rothstein 
after rothstein was convicted in june 1981 livingston was 
arrested on a shoplifting charge and gave miami police his 
undercover name 
the government indicated that livingston had psychiatric 
problems involving an inability to distinguish between his real and 
undercover identities the 11th circuit said in its opinion 
upon further investigation it was revealed that concerns for the 
mental health of livingston had been voiced by his superiors as 
early as march 1980 
since livingstons testimony was a key to the convictions of 
rothstein and his codefendant robert dibernardo their guilty 
verdicts were vacated and the indictments against them thrown out 
the 11th circuit however ruled in 1985 that the indictment could 
stand 
a federal judge then ordered new trials for both rothstein and 
dibernardo 
dibernardo whose conviction also had previously been reversed 
has been missing since june 1986 and no longer falls under the 11th 
circuits jurisdiction the court said he could deserve a new trial 
if he surfaces

west virginia attorney general charlie 
brown resigned monday as part of an agreement to halt the second 
criminal case against him since he took office in 1984 a prosecutor 
said 
kanawha county prosecutor bill forbes said he agreed to drop a 
grand jury investigation into browns campaign finances and reports 
that he lied under oath during a child custody hearing 
the attorney general agreed to resign and we agreed not to 
continue the investigation forbes said monday night it was in 
the best interest of the state the best interest of mr brown and 
the best interest of all concerned 
forbes said his office worked very intensely on the 
investigation for four weeks he said browns attorney called his 
office about noon monday and agreed to the arrangement which 
forbes office proposed a week ago 
the agreement was reached at 430 pm and brown 39 submitted 
his resignation to gov gaston caperton at 5 pm effective 
immediately 
under the agreement brown cannot talk to reporters about his 
guilt or innocence in the grand jury investigation 
telephone calls to browns home monday evening were not answered 
his spokeswoman carrie webster said he would have no comment until 
a news conference tuesday 
brown had testified thursday friday and monday before a county 
grand jury that was investigating both the attorney generals 
campaign financial records and an allegation that he had lied under 
oath during a child custody hearing 
we were going to ask for a vote on charges sometime this 
afternoon or early tomorrow forbes said

brown a democrat was elected in 1984 and reelected without 
opposition in 1988 
in 1986 brown was acquitted on charges that he shook down his 
staff for campaign contributions he contended that because he had 
solicited the contributions after the 1984 election to help pay off 
his campaign debts the actions did not fall under a state law 
prohibiting state officials from soliciting campaign funds from 
their staffs 
the latest grand jury investigation centered on browns testimony 
in a child custody hearing involving his exwife alice sue 
hypesbrown and their 5yearold girl 
forbes confirmed that the grand jury was looking into a report 
that brown had denied writing a note introduced as evidence in the 
hearing then later admitted writing it 
brown acknowledged that he denied writing the note but said he 
realized his mistake almost immediately he said he requested a 
brief recess and when the hearing resumed he corrected his 
testimony 
the charleston gazette reported two weeks ago that the note 
involved a request for 50000 from browns former secretary the 
paper said she had been impregnated by brown had had an abortion 
and demanded the money to keep quiet the secretary brenda k simon 
on columbus ohio has filed a 3 million libel suit against the 
paper denying the allegations 
a native of mansfield ohio brown is a graduate of denison 
university and the yale law school he served as a staff attorney

united states spend 75 billion to 8 billion to fight drugs but is 
not prepared to send us troops to aid colombias battle against 
drug lords his chief of staff said monday 
john sununu for the first time putting a price tag on the 
presidents antidrug blueprint said it would include more 
financial aid for other nations in the international war on drugs 
bush will unveil his proposal in a speech to the nation sept 5 
the day after he returns to washington from a nearlythree week 
vacation at the family compound here then will send implementing 
legislation to congress 
on another subject sununu taking note of renewed threats 
against two american hostages in lebanon said he would stick to a 
white house stance of not reacting to each new threat 
he said the administration does not want to increase attention 
on the hostages 
as for the drugfighting program sununu said the primary thrust 
of the presidents plan will be education also included will be 
money for law enforcement efforts interdiction and rehabilitation 
the chief of staff declined to say which federal programs the

sununu said bush made most of the final decisions on the package 
monday sending orders back to budget director richard darman

bush assured the colombian president of us support and 
reiterated the united states intention to render appropriate 
assistance as rapidly as possible 
officials of the drug enforcement administration said monday they 
were scrutinizing a list of 50 to 100 names among those arrested in 
colombia to see who might be extradited to the united states on drug 
charges 
on sunday thornburgh said us officials would have to look at 
any request that we get for either law enforcement or military 
assistance seriously last week bush himself said he would give 
serious consideration to any request from drugfighting south 
american nations for us troops 
but sununu told reporters monday 
we have in no way prepared for that kind of a request we 
assume that a request for additional assistance would primarily be 
focused on material and resources assets we could provide to them 
and that all indications to date have been that they have great 
faith in the capacity of their personnel if they have the 
appropriate equipment to be able to deal with the problem 
indeed the colombian government appears to have no intention of 
asking for us military assistance 
that nations envoy to the organization of american states 
leopoldo villar borda said no when asked monday if his 
government were preparing to ask for the dispatch of us troops 
bush will detail his antidrug strategy developed over several 
months by his drug policy coordinator william bennett in a 
televised address from the oval office 
sununu who met with bush in the morning at the presidents 
vacation home on walkers point talked to reporters while the 
president and two of his sons played a fast 18 holes of golf 
bush was asked as he teed off about new reports from beirut that 
proiranian hostage holders have threatened the lives of two 
kidnapped americans james cicippio and edward austin if france 
intervenes militarily in lebanons civil war 
bush deferred questions to sununu saying his chief of staff 
would explain our position 
but sununu did not go beyond previous administration statements 
on the hostages 
we are not going to react to each new threat he said the 
policy remains unchanged the president underscored that the 
hostagetakers are responsible for the safety of all the hostages 
he noted that france has said it does not intend to intervene 
militarily

the panamanian government on monday 
accused the united states of violating the panama canal treaties by 
conducting military exercises in panama 
also monday talks between the opposition and government broke 
off with no agreement on who will run the country after sept1 the 
opposition wants to take power based on its victory in may 7 
elections which were annulled by the government 
spokesmen for both sides said they would wait for wednesdays 
meeting of regional foreign ministers at the organization of 
american states washington offices before deciding how to proceed 
meanwhile foreign minister jorge ritter made the accusation to 
diplomats after a presentation of panamanian government film clips 
showing us military exercises 
all these maneuvers have been performed outside of the military 
zones and outside of the areas under joint military control 
ritter said 
ritter said he wanted the diplomats to be absolutely sure 
that the maneuvers violate both the treaties and panamas 
territorial integrity 
ritter said that the treaty obligates the us government to 
coordinate with panama its maneuvers air traffic and convoys he 
said the us has not done this in the military exercises 
us president jimmy carter and panamanian president omar 
torrijos signed the panama canal treaties in 1977 
the us government has repeated again and again its arbitrary 
interpretation of the treaty saying that all the maneuvers fall 
within the treaty limits ritter said 
the presentation included clips from 12 recent us military 
exercises 
ritter said the disproportionate presence of us military 
equipment in panama was one of the factors impeding an agreement 
between the panamanian government and the political opposition 
the united states has stepped up its pressure on military 
strongman manuel antonio noriega since the may presidential 
elections which international observers say the opposition won 
washington has been pressuring noriega to step down since 
february 1988 when he was indicted on charges of drug trafficking 
and money laundering by a florida grand jury 
oas foreign ministers proposed on july 20 that a provisional 
government be installed sept 1 when the term of acting president 
manuel solis palma expires and that new elections follow 
the government military and government political parties agreed 
but the opposition has refused demanding that noriega resign as 
chief of the defense forces the government says noriega will not 
step down

americas aids education efforts have been 
impaired by staff shortages at the centers for disease control the 
general accounting office said monday 
the arm of cdc that handles education programs the center for 
prevention services requested additional staff four times in 1988 
said a report from gao the congressional investigative body 
but cdc was unable to provide the additional employees because 
of agencywide staffing contraints the report said 
this year the center sought 65 additional employees but money 
was available for only 35 as of may 31 the center had 93 staff 
members working on aids programs and funds to hire 33 more by the 
end of the fiscal year sept 30 the center believes it will need 
30 additional employees above that gao said 
the report was requested by sen john glenn dohio chairman of 
the senate governmental affairs committee 
we must make sure that every dollar spent on aids prevention 
counts and this report raises serious questions in my mind as to 
whether this investment is being managed wisely glenn said in a 
statement 
health administrators and congress have been at odds for some 
time each accusing the other of failing to do enough to control 
aids 
earlier this month dr james o mason assistant secretary for 
health in the department of health and human services complained to 
congress that it too often has authorized programs but failed to 
provide money 
his example was an aids treatment program congress said the 
government could spend 15 million to help pay for treatments with 
the drug azt but lawmakers didnt come through with a new 
appropriation that meant administrators had to find the 15 million 
somewhere else if they wanted to run the program 
the same situation looms for the next fiscal year when 30 
million is authorized for the azt program mason said 
the only place i can find that is to take it out of prevention 
or biomedical research he told a house oversight subcommittee 
someone has to make a priority decision 
azt costs are expected to rise sharply whether through medicaid 
or other programs because of recent dramatic findings that the drug 
can delay the onset of harm to the immune system among people 
carrying the aids virus 
a course of azt treatment costs 8000 a year which some experts 
have said might be halved 
last month the number of americans diagnosed as having aids 
surpassed the 100000 mark more than 58000 of them have died

monday holding a course that will keep it far from the united 
states according to the national hurricane center 
it looks like it will eventually turn northward and be of 
primary interest to marine interests said hurricane specialist

1200 miles southwest of the azores island chain gerrish said from

the storm packed winds of 45 mph sometimes gusting higher in 
squalls as it moved northwest at 11 mph little change in strength 
or motion was expected monday night gerrish said 
tropical depressions become named storms if their sustained winds 
reach 39 mph hurricanes are formed when winds hit 74 mph 
there have been seven depressions in the present atlantic

soldiers and police raided the estates of 
cocaine barons monday seizing aircraft cars and cattle and 
bringing the number of people arrested in three days to more than 
11000 authorities said 
one of those arrested monday was believed to be a finance chief 
of the medellin drug cartel 
the cartel bosses have eluded the emergencyrule crackdown but 
new raids were being reported hourly across the country 
president virgilio barco authorized the raids after the killings 
thursday and friday of a judge a national police colonel and sen 
luis carlos galan of the liberal party the leading presidential 
candidate and an outspoken opponent of the drug bosses 
we havent yet been able to capture the drug cartel chiefs but 
we have struck hard against their immense fortunes said army gen 
manuel bonnet locarno 
in an interview broadcast by the national radio chain caracol 
from the western city of cali a cocaine smuggling center bonnet 
said the strategy was economic war on the traffickers 
defense ministry communiques said more than 11000 people have 
been detained in about 350 raids but bonnet said most were believed 
to be simple employees of the cartel members or lowlevel underlings 
however military authorities in sincelejo capital of northern 
sucre state said they had captured an alleged finance chief of the 
drug cartel based in the industrial city of medellin 
they identified him as eduardo martinez romero and said he was 
captured at a ranch two hours outside sincelejo but gave no other 
details 
statements from the defense ministry said 622 weapons 1023 
vehicles scores of planes and helicopters and four tons of cocaine 
paste were confiscated 
early monday on bogotas northern fringes soldiers swarmed over 
an opulent compound said to be owned by gonzalo rodriguez gacha one 
of the biggest cocaine dealers 
the estate included tennis soccer and basketball courts a duck 
pond with a water wheel a gymnasium with weightlifting equipment 
an indoor swimming pool and billard and table tennis tables 
soldiers guarding it said rodriguez gacha owned many other estates 
among targets of the raids were scores of properties owned by 
rodriguez gacha and other drug lords including pablo escobar and 
jorge ochoa at one of escobars ranches soldiers confiscated 2000 
head of cattle and 100 pigs the defense ministry said 
barco invoked the powers of a state of siege that has been in 
effect since 1984 it gives the military and police special powers 
to detain suspects stiffens penalties for those convicted of drug 
dealing and allows confiscation of property 
he also authorized the government to extradite drug suspects 
wanted in the united states which the cartel has opposed with 
threats and murder 
monday was a national holiday and no officials were available to 
comment about us willingness to send troops to help in the drug 
war 
at galans funeral sunday barco called for international 
cooperation to stop the drug trade us officials said soldiers 
might be sent if colombia asked for them 
colombia has repeatedly stressed its opposition to the presence 
of foreign troops on its soil and there was no indication that 
position had changed

developers offered hannelore kraus 
16 million to drop her lawsuit blocking the construction of what 
would be europes tallest skyscraper in her neighborhood in downtown 
frankfurt 
she refused 
it would ruin the neighborhood mrs kraus explained in her home 
about 200 feet from the building site overlooking one of frankfurts 
busiest and noisiest intersections 
her onewoman campaign against the campanile as the skyscraper 
would be called has made the 49yearold mrs kraus a local 
celebrity and the bane of developers planning other skyscrapers in 
frankfurt a world financial center 
mrs kraus has the right under hesse state law to block the 
campanile because it would cut her home off from sunlight and the 
law specifies that every homeowner has a right to sunlight 
the developers have not said how many stories they plan in the 
building but it will be 265 meters tall or 869 feet which would 
make it slightly less than threequarters the height of the 
102story empire state building in new york city 
the campanile is just too big for this area mrs kraus said 
then you have the whole array of problems that crop up for 
example traffic and burdens on the environment 
that she added isnt worth becoming an instant millionaire 
i cant approve of this building by somehow personally taking 
myself out of controversy or by being paid off she said in an 
interview in her apartment in the sixstory building she owns near 
the main railroad station developers originally had hoped to start 
construction in march and say she is the sole cause of a costly 
delay 
mrs kraus also runs a small pension nearby in her gutleutviertel 
neighborhood 
while the ethnically mixed crossroads in the citys center often 
puts german speakers in the minority mrs kraus says the campanile 
would destroy the excellent neighborliness in the area 
even my pension guests who are here for a short time notice 
that says mrs kraus they go down to the small restaurants 
nearby to the spaniard or the yugoslav or the greek 
she says that during the annual summer street festival everyone 
in the area takes part even the turkish grandmothers who before 
just looked out of the upperstory windows and didnt dare to come 
down 
mrs kraus takes pride in defending the area where she has lived 
most of her life and she chuckles as she recalls how a former city 
planner predicted money would persuade her to change her mind mrs 
kraus is unmarried but it is customary in germany to refer to women 
in her age bracket as frau or mrs she also holds a doctorate in 
political science and that requires her foes to address her as 
frau doktor kraus when they discuss the issue with her 
these skyscrapers are a thing of the past she said because 
of what she called their excessive energy consumption 
various developers are watching the outcome closely because they 
plan to build a halfdozen or so skyscrapers in frankfurt 
critics claim the building boom is excessive in this city of 
about 600000 people 
developers say the total price tag for the campanile project 
including the land runs to nearly 405 million 
mrs kraus faced off with valentin weber of the fay industrieund 
wohnbau kg representing the developers on a recent television 
program 
if we were making a movie said host guenther jauch then 
you two would get married in the end and everything would be 
settled that way 
weber responded that he was already happily married and mrs 
kraus observed that alas marriages arent as simple as they used 
to be

a fragile accord setting out 
conditions for ending surinames 3yearold guerrilla war is testing 
the civilian governments authority over the army which previously 
ruled the former dutch colony 
the government of president ramsewak shankar signed a preliminary 
accord with the warring jungle commando in july despite the armys 
objections that the agreement failed to disarm the guerrillas and 
could place too much power in the hands of rebel leader ronny 
brunswijk 
lt col desi bouterse the armed forces chief who ruled the 
georgiasized nation on south americas northeast shoulder for seven 
years until elections in november 1987 says that if the government 
insists on implementing the agreement it will do so without the 
armys help 
the outcome of the dispute could help answer a question 
surinamers have long been asking who is running the country the 
government or the army 
the agreement is testing the obedience of the military 
humanrights activist stanley rensch said in an interview we are 
facing a rather complicated and dangerous situation 
since fighting broke out in july 1986 at least 300 people have 
been killed dozens of villages destroyed and crucial bauxite and 
aluminum mining disrupted an estimated 7000 bush negroes have fled 
to refugee camps in neighboring french guiana after repeated raids 
by soldiers flushing out guerrilla sympathizers 
the war began as a personal feud between bouterse 42 a former 
physical education teacher and brunswijk 28 a cubantrained 
soldier who wears dreadlocks and gold chains and once served as 
bouterses bodyguard 
over the years however the insurgency assumed political 
dimensions with brunswijk a bush negro demanding democratic 
reforms civil rights and economic development for the countrys 
50000 to 60000 bush negroes 
bush negroes also known as maroons the descendants of runaway 
african slaves inhabit the rugged eastern interior where the 
fighting has been concentrated suriname south americas only 
dutchspeaking country has a total population of 400000 
longstalled peace talks bore fruit after a period of heightened 
tension culminating in the rebel seizure of surinames main 
hydroelectric plant june 1 the rebels had threatened to blow up the 
power plant and part of afobaka dam flooding the capital of 
paramaribo unless the government agreed to direct negotiations with 
the jungle commando the rebels withdrew however after 36 hours 
on brunswijks orders 
after talks june 78 on the french guianese island of portal a 
delegation from surinames national assembly and brunswijks jungle 
commando reached agreement on a tentative peace proposal the 
government signed the pact july 21 and it was approved by the full 
national assembly on aug 7 
the accord declared the intention of both sides to end 
hostilities but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire 
nevertheless only minor skirmishes have been reported since it was 
signed 
among the agreed conditions for a permanent peace are an 
emergency aid program to rebuild bush negro villages an end to a 
state of emergency in the eastern part of the country and the return 
of refugees to suriname 
the most contentious issue however stipulates that brunswijks 
200 to 300 guerrillas would not have to give up their weapons and 
would be transformed into a special security unit to patrol an 
interior region comprising twothirds of the country 
bouterse says such a force would be unconstitutional split the 
nation and make brunswijk the de facto ruler of the interior 
moreover the army demands the jungle commando be disbanded and 
forced to turn in its weapons 
as long as the jungle commando is not brought under the central 
authority of the government no other arrangements are possible 
bouterse told reporters recently 
although bouterse insists he is not trying to subvert the 
agreement his opposition puts the army in direct conflict with a 
government it has never fully trusted 
we are feeling like the government is the enemy of the national 
army said maj badrissein sital commander of the 2500man force 
most of the time there is no trust or understanding the 
government uses the excuse that we are a hindrance but the truth is 
they are incapable of dealing with daytoday problems 
brunswijks supporters say making the jungle commando a police 
unit would give the rebels the main inhabitants in the interior a 
chance to participate in the development of the region 
ronny asks only that they be given a job the task of 
attending to peace and development in the interior said ojerda 
von dooren a franciscan nun close to brunswijk 
but sital said such a force would mean the country will be 
practically separated in different sections we cant deal with 
that 
we cant negotiate with terrorists and weve always referred to 
brunswijk as that the army chief said

britain is to decide this autumn whether to allow 
its first trials of suspected nazi war criminals living in this 
country 
if it opts for prosecution it will mean hauling at least three 
aging men from the sheltered respectability of suburbia to answer 
charges as mass murderers of jews 
a report commissioned by the government and published july 24 
says there is enough evidence to prosecute four suspects one of 
whom has since died and urges further investigation of 124 other 
cases 
to take no action would taint the united kingdom with the slur 
of being a haven for war criminals the report says 
but the government has made no immediate decision preferring to 
leave it to a vote in parliament where lawmakers are deeply divided 
the yearlong investigation which amassed testimony from 
witnesses in the soviet union was conducted by two eminent lawyers 
one of them sir thomas hetherington 62 britains former director 
of public prosecutions 
with the videotaped accounts the lawyers obtained of death camp 
atrocities in nazioccupied soviet territories a legacy of world 
war ii has returned to haunt britain 50 years after it declared war 
on hitlers germany 
immediately after the war in 1945 britain and its allies 
accepted waves of refugees war criminals slipped through 
perfunctory screening procedures 
there was also a tacit policy of letting bygones be bygones by 
1951 britain had ceased to take part in war crimes proceedings 
then the cold war set in and at least five soviet requests for 
the extradition of war crimes suspects were rebuffed on the grounds 
that britain had no extradition treaty with the soviet union 
latterday concern about war criminals prompted the united states 
to set up an office of special investigations and canada and 
australia have changed their laws in the past five years to allow 
prosecutions 
now britain must decide through the parliamentary vote set for 
october whether to go ahead with the trials 
the british inquiry followed the submission of a list of suspects 
in october 1986 by the nazihunting simon wiesenthal center to 
home secretary douglas hurd 
a scottish television documentary produced more names and in the 
end the government inquiry checked allegations against 301 people 
living in britain because of lack of time the investigators 
examined only seven cases in detail 
i was surprised by the size of the crimes and by the quality of 
the evidence hetherington was quoted as saying in an interview 
with the independent newspaper 
i was initially surprised by the memory of witnesses until i 
think it was simon wiesenthal pointed out that people who have been 
through that sort of horror dont forget 
the scottish tv investigation focused on antanas gecas now 73 a 
lithuanianborn mining engineer the only suspect who has been 
identified publicly 
gecas a tall burly man who came to britain in 1947 lives in a 
middleclass district of edinburgh with his wife and daughter 
in the scottish film he acknowledged witnessing atrocities while 
serving in one of the notorious lithuanian police battalions that 
killed an estimated 220000 jews 
but he said he only watched and insisted he was now being 
victimized by a soviet smear campaign 
he took no action against the scottish tv program crimes of 
war when it was shown the first time in 1987 but when it was 
repeated this past july 24 the hourlong film had to be cut off 15 
minutes early because he obtained an injunction against it 
the government report names the suspects in a separate section 
being kept secret along with the videotaped witness accounts to 
avoid prejudicing a trial 
the suspects in britain are almost all former nationals of the 
soviet territories of lithuania ukraine and latvia scenes of some 
of the worst atrocities 
mobile death squads einsatzgruppen set up by the nazi ss and 
often enthusiastically manned by locals killed tens of thousands of 
jews rounding them up shooting men women and children and 
sometimes burying alive bulletridden victims who attempted crawl 
out from the mass graves 
hetherington says the first court case could begin late next year 
if the law is changed speedily to allow the trial of naturalized 
britons for crimes committed outside this country 
some influential voices say nothing will be served that elderly 
witnesses may make mistakes that soviet authorities may pinpoint 
men who were not criminals but anticommunists 
one such is lord shawcross a distinguished lawyer who prosecuted 
top nazis at the postwar nuremberg trials 
i cannot believe that a revival of all these sad and terrible 
matters by sensational trials of a small handful of aged men 
will help to promote understanding and friendship between the 
different peoples of the world will help to eliminate the evil of 
antisemitism or still less enhance the respect for british 
justice shawcross said in a letter to the times of london 
legislator spencer batiste of the governing conservative party 
replied the simple fact is that those who have been guilty of 
horrendous crimes against humanity must never be able to feel that 
they are capable of achieving a safe haven in a civilized world

the staterun television 
network faces charges of biased political coverage as the governing 
national party heads toward what could be its most difficult 
election since taking power in 1948 
the south african broadcasting corps telecasts are the main 
source of news for more than half of the countrys 5 million whites 
according to surveys 
the sabc insists it provides impartial reporting but critics 
charge that a strong progovernment bias undercuts both white 
opposition parties and black antiapartheid groups 
the sept 6 election although excluding the black majority is 
viewed as a potentially crucial event opinion polls suggest that 
the farright conservative party and liberal democratic party could 
gain enough ground to deprive the national party of an outright 
majority in parliaments dominant white chamber 
the sabc has been carrying fullfledged political debates for the 
first time allowing opposition candidates to skirmish with their 
nationalist rivals the debates have been welcomed but accusations 
persist that sabcs news division promotes national party interests 
despite a clause in the corporations charter calling for 
impartiality 
the sabc goes far beyond simply being a propaganda vehicle 
said john van zyl a professor of film and television at the 
university of the witwatersrand it constructs a political map 
which shows the national party in the middle where the conservative 
party and democratic party are in disarray and the 
extraparliamentary opposition groups are suppressed completely 
van zyl and some of his students are conducting a study of the 
sabcs political coverage during the election campaign an interim 
report issued aug 7 said the sabc had ignored the views of major 
antiapartheid organizations and reported their actions in ways that 
were favorable to the government 
they cited as an example the protest aug 2 in which black and 
indian patients sought treatment at white hospitals sabc news 
reports suggested that police vigilance helped avert chaos and made 
no mention of organizers statements that the protest was intended 
from the start to be peaceful and nondisruptive 
a wide range of prominent opposition leaders including white 
human rights activists black trade union officials and clergymen 
such as the anglican archbishop desmond tutu are seldom heard on 
sabc newscasts while routine speeches by cabinet ministers often 
are reported at length 
the director of sabc news carel van der merwe said the 
corporations policy is to report on actions and statements from 
nonparliamentary opposition groups if these are deemed newsworthy 
he said the sabc did not seek to stereotype any political parties 
and pursued coverage that would supply knowledge and insight to 
the viewer 
sabc crews sometimes have exclusive access to police operations 
so negative is the sabcs image among activists that its crews 
occasionally are evicted from antiapartheid gatherings 
the congress of south african trade unions a militantly 
antiapartheid labor federation said it felt flattered by the 
constant barrage of lies and misinformation being spread on sabc 
television radio and other national party propaganda organs 
van zyl said government officials sometimes give explicit 
instructions to the sabc regarding the content of news reports one 
such incident in 1987 was widely publicized when president pw 
botha telephoned in the midst of an evening newscast and 
successfully demanded a revised report on his ouster of a mixedrace 
cabinet minister 
asked about government interference in the news van der merwe 
said im not responding to dead horses 
the sabcs television service is relatively new dating back to 
1976 it operates two whiteoriented channels and two blackoriented 
channels 
the only independent television service is provided by mnet a 
paytv company established in 1986 it is barred from broadcasting 
news programs 
the sabc also operates more than 20 radio stations the one 
independent station radio 702 in johannesburg is allowed to 
broadcast news and recently expanded its news programming 
the sabcs directors are presidential appointees and most of its 
top managers are afrikaners the mainly dutchdescended whites who 
dominate the national party but many of the corporations 7000 
employees are blacks seeking technical experience in broadcasting 
that is not available elsewhere 
budget deficits have plagued the sabc in recent years and 
critics say the quality of locally produced programs has dropped 
british entertainment unions wont allow their shows to air in south 
africa and most current programs are series produced a year or more 
ago in the united states 
against this background the political debates have been praised 
by local television critics as a small step toward meaningful 
programming 
now that the era of twoman white debate has arrived perhaps 
the possibility will one day arise of real debate involving all 
south africans wrote sheryl raine of johannesburgs sunday star 
but dont hold your breath

washington career that spans 24 years in congress and a tour in the 
state department during the reagan administration 
so far he said in an interview the promotion of the veterans 
agency to become the 14th cabinet agency hasnt had a visible impact 
on the people who use its services but derwinski thinks it will 
make a difference 
the real changes are going to come with time he said some 
are intangible just the psychology of being at the cabinet 
meetings access to the president 
thats the status the veterans lobby sought for years in its 
campaign to make the va part of the cabinet they got their way when 
president ronald reagan who had come to office saying he was going 
to cut the size of the cabinet agreed to enlarge it in a political 
farewell gift during the 1988 campaign president bush welcomed the 
move 
as derwinski once remarked no politician in his right mind is 
against veterans 
but the big veterans organizations may not always get what they 
thought they were bargaining for when they campaigned to create the 
department derwinskis clout strengthens his hand outside the 
government too 
thats his answer to the skeptics who worried that interest 
groups like the american legion and the veterans of foreign wars 
might gain too much influence with the va seated at the cabinet 
table 
derwinski said he looks to groups like those for constructive 
advice but cedes them no control were running the shop for the 
benefit of the individual veteran he said 
in doing that there are tricks of the politicianbureaucrats 
trade and derwinski knows them the budget for veterans is handled 
by a house appropriations subcommittee that also deals with spending 
for the department of housing and urban development and for nasa 
although that is not supposed to foster competition among agencies 
it does were fighting other entities of the government for a 
share of the budget he said obviously weve alerted the 
veterans groups to that 
he also has a case to make at the office of management and 
budget and some advantages to call in there too because of 
congressional ties and because of the political muscle of the 
veterans groups 
the hill will take our side more often than not derwinski 
said they know that at omb we know that 
his predecessor the last veterans administrator came under 
criticism for budget cuts that forced reductions in some phases of 
care at va hospitals the agency operates 172 of them along with 
226 clinics 
derwinski doesnt deny the budget problem its going to be 
hitting all of us he said but he isnt acquiescing in cuts 
medical care accounts for the biggest chunk of his budget nearly 
11 billion and those costs keep increasing 
so derwinski struck a deal with the administrations budget 
managers hes seeking a review commission to study all veterans 
health care programs for the first time in 25 years with an eye to 
efficiency and economy and with a commitment to invest any savings 
in maintaining and improving medical care 
of course the review commission carries its own set of problems 
derwinski has asked congress to set it up to make binding 
recommendations on veterans hospitals under the bill congress 
would have to accept the commission findings or scrap the whole 
review 
derwinski talks of changing missions and combining functions that 
overlap or duplicate others carefully avoiding any suggestion that 
some va hospitals might be shut down 
those would be fighting words in congress derwinski said his 
years as a republican congressman from illinois taught him that 
members of congress consider the va hospitals in their districts to 
be an inviolable combination of patronage and public works 
so therell be no easy route for his review plan but derwinski 
figures he can negotiate with people among whom he served until he 
lost his seat to redistricting in 1982 
we cant have congress piecemealing our operations he said 
i dont mind arguing with congress as an old congressman i can do 
it more gracefully than some others

some of the biggest investment mistakes evolve 
from the notion that there is easy money to be made that there are 
sure things that cant miss that a person is missing out on a 
free ride 
its the beginning of a series of mistakes each one leading 
deeper into disaster its an old story too one that everyone has 
heard at least once and is bound to hear many times more 
bert dohmen who runs the wellington financial corp and 
publishes the wellington letter has succinctly described the 
psychology of the sure thing that traps and embitters so many 
individual investors 
the process begins with the economy running smoothly all visible 
economic problems seem to have vanished theyre still there of 
course as they always are but not so visible the stock market 
has been rising 
why shouldnt it rise corporate earnings have been good for many 
months investors are falling all over each other to buy your 
neighbors are talking about the killing theyve made and the 
forecasters say the skys the limit 
thats usually a market top says dohmen the wonderful signs of 
health that attract the small investor were foreseen months or even 
years earlier by smart investors and now they are preparing to take 
their profits 
after the market falls the small investor who made mistake 
number one is set up to make mistake number two having lost so much 
money so quickly the small investor is terrified and vows to get 
out that seals in the loss 
to sell however seems to make sense the urge is irresistible 
everything looks bleak the economy appears to be in shambles other 
investors are gloomy and even some of the optimists are ready to 
sell at the first sign of a rally 
the sense of gloom is pervasive it cannot be escaped bad news 
begets bad news one sad story at a cocktail party leads to another 
nobody has a good word to say about stocks stock analysts forecast 
even more bad news 
one persons disaster is another ones opportunity smart 
investors seize the bargains and sit on them they recognize that 
theyre taking a risk but they have confidence that unless america 
is through stocks will rise again 
these longterm investors do not expect quick profits they are 
not playing the market that is trying to outguess it they are 
content to let their stock ride with the tide that eventually must 
develop 
meanwhile the sadsack investor is trying to pay the bills and 
doesnt want to hear anything about stocks he or she has sworn 
off the market with a vow never to return probably complaining that 
its a rigged game 
eventually however the market begins to rise again even before 
the economy recovers the rise is quiet and steady investor hopes 
are restrained and any speculative fervor is still a long way off 
after a year of this the hapless investor the perpetrator of 
mistakes no 1 and no 2 begins to harbor a secret greed maybe he 
could get even maybe he could correct the great injustice done to 
him 
he ponders he is about to commit big mistake no 3 resistance 
worn down quick money and maybe retribution in mind and convinced 
that theres no money to be made in his lowinterest cds he 
prepares to act 
the trigger might be almost anything overhearing a chance 
remark the excitement of the media a telephone call from an old 
broker friend a tip on a sure thing 
but says dohmen our errorprone investor now feels almost 
embarrassed to have sold at the bottom and then missed the upturn 
he waits and waits for lower prices the market keeps rising the 
pressure on him rises 
finally he is convinced more significant he is determined not 
to commit the mistakes he made earlier that caused him to miss out 
on a good thing he makes the plunge he has erred again 
it is hard for such people not to err again to correct the 
problem they should of course learn to measure the market cycles 
and accept the fact that there is risk rather than certainty 
then says dohmen they should begin with a brand new attitude 
to increase your success in the markets its best to forget 
the past and pretend you are starting fresh 
if theres a great stock which you unfortunately sold at lower 
prices forget where you sold it and buy if you think its an 
opportunity 
dont be embarrassed the market doesnt know where you bought 
it or sold it it just continues to do what it does

on sept 6 south africas governing national 
party faces probably its toughest election since it took power in 
1948 and formally imposed the system known as apartheid or 
separation of the races some experts say the party could lose its 
outright majority in parliament under a twopronged assault from the 
left and right here are profiles of its two resurgent rivals the 
farright conservative party and the antiapartheid democratic party 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the farright conservative partys 
solution to south africas political and racial turmoil is simple 
strengthen apartheid 
the blunt call for strict segregation at a time of political 
uncertainty earned the conservatives 26 percent of the countrys 
white vote in 1987 a figure almost certain to rise in the elections 
for a new parliament on sept 6 
we are not prepared to share power with blacks coloreds or 
indians the partys leader andries treurnicht wrote recently 
that will undoubtedly lead to black majority government a 
racially integrated south africa the further impoverishment of 
whites 
the conservatives hold 23 of the 166 elected seats in the 
dominant white chamber of parliament and could gain at least 20 
they were given a boost by the resignation aug 14 of president pw 
botha and his bitter criticism of his own national party which has 
held power since 1948 
the conservatives control dozens of local governments where they 
have been reimposing hardline apartheid measures despite 
controversy and stiff resistance 
the national party has joined the chorus of critics attacking the 
return of petty apartheid measures but the conservatives say 
they are merely enforcing laws placed on the books by the 
nationalists 
in boksburg an industrial town 12 miles southeast of 
johannesburg the conservativecontrolled city council resegregated 
the town park athletic fields municipal halls and other facilities 
last year 
blacks organized a consumer boycott in december that initially 
looked as if it would cripple the town economically political 
observers both black and white predicted boksburg would produce an 
embarrassing failure for the conservatives 
but the city council stood firm and the boycott has weakened 
over time on a recent weekday afternoon black shoppers far 
outnumbered whites at the largest supermarket on the towns main 
street 
the conservatives now point proudly to boksburg as proof of its 
ability to withstand pressure 
we are fighting for the white mans future and we dont mind a 
little pressure said sias nothnagel the conservative candidate 
for parliament in boksburg 
in its preelection newsletter the conservatives compare 
boksburg with hillbrow a whitesonly section of johannesburg 
into which thousands of blacks have moved illegally in recent years 
the national party government has said it might legally open 
hillbrow and a few other select neighborhoods to all races 
boksburgs crime rate has been falling while hillbrow has one of 
the highest in the country the conservatives note they say 
property values are rising and new businesses are opening in 
boksburg while housing prices are falling and shops are closing in 
hillbrow 
your choice hillbrow national party or boksburg 
conservative party a conservative ad says 
the message has strong appeal for many rural and bluecollar 
whites who see the national partys limited race reforms as 
capitulation to the black majority 
why are so many people voting for the conservative party 
asked acting president fw de klerk the leader of the national 
party its not because they think the policy can work its 
because they feel endangered 
blacks are coming to the cities in increasing numbers and in many 
cases are getting jobs previously held by whites most public 
facilities have been integrated especially in major cities 
there is no way one can protect the white people in one 
undivided state juxtaposed with an everincreasing and overwhelming 
number of blacks said treurnicht who holds a doctorate in 
theology and was a national party cabinet minister before resigning 
in 1982 to organize the conservatives 
the conservatives want to partition south africa into one white 
and several black nations as envisioned by prime minister 
hendrik verwoerd a nationalist in the early 1960s 
the national party government has created 10 black homelands but 
only four have accepted nominal independence and none is 
recognized abroad the government has given no indication it plans 
to dismantle the homelands but has acknowledged that blacks living 
outside these tribal territories should have some degree of 
political rights 
whites account for only 5 million of south africas 37 million 
people but the conservatives seek to claim all the major cities and 
the best farmland for whites 
we believe it is not too late to implement partition said 
treurnicht we will not be talked or intimidated out of that which 
is legally ours a part of south africa where we will govern 
ourselves

with the help of 
hollywoodstyle glitz south africas white liberals are trying to 
shed their image as political amateurs and gain a powerbroking role 
in the sept 6 elections for parliament 
the theme song from chariots of fire blared from loudspeakers 
when the new democratic party was launched in april welding three 
separate and sometimes squabbling factions into one 
now in the homestretch of the campaign the democrats have 
unveiled south africas first cinematic political advertisements 
which appear amid film previews and cigarette commercials at movie 
theaters nationwide 
the films softpeddle the partys opposition to apartheid and its 
call for black voting rights instead the ads accuse the national 
party government of economic mismanagement and corruption 
the democrats roadside posters proclaim we are the future 
ads in newspapers try to dispel the liberals soft on security 
image by showing their candidates who were army or police officers 
whether the imagery will convert to votes remains to be seen but 
there is no question the democrats have presented the national party 
with its most serious election threat from the left since it took 
power in 1948 
the democrats hold 19 of the 166 elected seats in parliaments 
dominant white chamber party leaders hope to double this number 
and 30 seats seem possible to independent analysts 
what the democrats hope for is a hung parliament with the 
national party losing its outright majority in a twopronged squeeze 
from the left and from the farright conservative party 
in that event it is at least possible the national party would 
form a coalition with the democrats agreeing to speed up reform in 
exchange for support on legislation 
for now however nationalist candidates are contemptuous of the 
new party saying it is manipulated by militant antiapartheid 
organizations 
radicals and revolutionaries decide for them said law and 
order minister adriaan vlok 
the democrats have three leaders who agreed to a troika after 
the unification of three antiapartheid parties was completed in 
april 
according to opinion polls the most widely favored of the three 
is denis worrall a former ambassador to britain who quit the 
national party to protest the slow pace of reform the other leaders 
are zach de beer a former corporate executive and wynand malan a 
former national party member of parliament who now leads the 
democrats most leftwing faction 
ordinary south africans are hungering for a change worrall 
said at a recent rally they want to vote for the democratic party 
because they know that in that way they are sending a message to our 
fellow black south africans and the international community that 
we are ready to say goodbye and good riddance to apartheid 
on the key issue of black political rights the democratic party 
platform calls for negotiations with all factions including the 
outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement to draft a 
new constitution 
the dp constitution will protect our nations various cultures 
religions and languages and will prevent majority domination the 
platform says at the same time it will allow every south african 
a vote of equal value 
it calls for creation of a decentralized federal system and the 
adoption of a bill of rights 
the national party has scoffed at the democrats professed 
opposition to majority domination 
a federal system means majority rule in every federal state 
said acting president fw de klerk the national party leader 
minority interests couldnt be protected it can result in the 
end of democracy 
one problem for the democratic party is that militant 
antiapartheid factions have little respect for it most black 
activists and white militants who work with them oppose the entire 
parliamentary structure because it excludes the black majority while 
offering token power to asians and people of mixed race classified 
as coloreds who have their own separate chambers in parliament 
the mass democratic movement a coalition of several major 
antiapartheid groups has been particularly critical of the 
democrats decision to field candidates in races for the asian 
chamber militants have consistently called for boycotts of 
elections for both nonwhite chambers since they were created in 
1984

on the street of small hope a forgotten 
italy lives on 
plump women hawk contraband cigarettes sewing machines whir in 
sweatshops crammedin families gather around supper tables just a 
few feet from their beds 
here nothing ever changes notes shopkeeper antonio 
vecchione gesturing to the crumbling golden tenements lining 
naples 16thcentury spanish quarter 
but recently a dramatic proposal from a business group has put 
in question the future of the via speranzella street of small hope 
and the rest of naples vast dilapidated historical zone 
the proposal which envisions restoring or replacing thousands of 
apartments has prompted charges that one of europes biggest 
historic areas could be erased and its occupants forced out 
the city has not yet said how much of the plan it will approve 
however the proposals powerful backers and its critics believe 
it has a good chance of becoming reality 
we must intervene declares enzo giustino president of the 
business group known as the kingdom of the possible the city 
runs the risk of being left behind by history 
neapolitans are intensely proud of their city known for its 
songs its dark blue bay and its history illustrated by medieval 
castles and graceful palaces from the 15th to 18th centuries 
but while italy has become one of the worlds biggest industrial 
powers naples has remained dogged by unemployment organized crime 
and corruption its narrow streets are choked with traffic 
thousands of families live in dark oneroom apartments 
the kingdom of the possible argues that only a dramatic step 
by the private sector can save the cultural heritage livability and 
economy of the 1780acre historic center 
the italian state is the weakest in the world giustino 
contended in an interview it cant solve these problems by 
itself 
four years ago giustino a construction executive and top 
official of the italian employers association assembled a 
coalition of some of the citys most powerful forces banks 
construction firms and stateowned businesses 
they enlisted dozens of architects economists and sociologists 
to study the historic center of the city of 12 million last year 
their 700page proposal was presented to the italian premier in rome 
and local officials 
cultural groups were outraged 
their biggest objection the proposed demolition of at least 663 
apartments to make room for parks and the vast alteration or 
destruction of 21066 others to make room for more modern apartments 
it would mean rubbing out a part of our history protested 
guido donatone of the national preservation group italia nostra 
from a hillside he pointed to the patchwork of gray and brown 
roofs in the spanish quarter named for the troops encamped there 
when naples was under spanish rule in the early 1500s 
this would all be skyscrapers he said 
actually the proposal would leave the renovation of the spanish 
quarter to an architectural competition 
the plan calls for keeping the character of most historic 
neighborhoods the exteriors of some buildings would be preserved 
while apartments inside are rebuilt for example and others would 
undergo extensive to minor restoration 
but critics still fear the project would become dominated by 
speculators who in the past have covered naples hillsides with 
anonymous concrete apartments 
giustino disagrees with that conclusion saying his group has 
presented all its ideas publicly 
critics also maintain the plan would force out artisans and 
shopkeepers and prompt a rush of yuppies 
their concern is a proposal to finance the 74billion project 
by charging the owners of the apartments assisted by state or local 
funds 
this has a social cost that is not quantified said maurizio 
barracco a director of the cultural group naples 99 how many 
people will have to leave 
despite the objections the city is now drawing up renovation 
proposals its urban planning chief maurizio cardano said we 
see the possibility of harmonizing their project with ours 
we have a kind of strange attitude in italy he added we 
preserve everything without discrimination 
he added that improved living conditions were often more 
important than preservation a view shared by people in the spanish 
quarter 
this is really degraded said a darkhaired woman indicating 
the street outside her toiletries shop it should all be knocked 
down 
shopkeeper vecchione said he favored rebuilding but expected 
little change 
they havent done it yet i dont think they ever will he 
said with a shrug

guerrillas on the 6000foot 
volcano looming over san salvadors northwestern limits have turned 
the workingclass neighborhood of san ramon into another 
bulletpocked battlefront 
contingents of leftist rebels have come down the slopes four 
times in nine months to attack an army post in the center of the 
ramshackle district of 30000 people 
the attacks are part of a yearold guerrilla campaign to bring 
their war against the government into the capital the salvadoran 
military says the guerrillas are making urban attacks because 
theyve failed elsewhere 
but three of the four raids were staged in daylight illustrating 
the guerrillas confidence in their ability to at least partly 
neutralize the governments single greatest tactical advantage air 
power 
each time the combat is more fierce said marta teresa 
figueroa a vendor in the stalllined market alley hard hit by the 
fighting it will happen again and next time it will be worse 
she stood 10 feet from the spot where santos barrera a 
60yearold mason was killed by a bullet in the head the afternoon 
of aug 1 that raid also left a soldier dead another wounded and 
two civilians a marketstall owner and her daughter wounded 
three of barreras grandchildren stood on the stoop of his humble 
cinderblock home and told how they huddled under beds while the 
fighting raged for two hours 
asked if the attacks made her afraid to come to the market 
16yearold cheeseseller julieta lopez said yes but necessity 
obliges us to risk our lives 
though residents of san ramon have nothing against the soldiers 
manning the post several said there is a feeling that the 
detachment should be withdrawn or at least moved from the 
districts center 
miguel angel riveras arm is still bandaged and in a sling from a 
wound he received in november during the first attack on san ramon 
he had stopped to light a cigarette for a soldier when the first 
fusillade exploded out of the darkness 
the bone in the 21yearold bus faretakers upper arm was 
shattered the artery severed and much of the nerve destroyed 
they should remove the post to a more isolated place he 
said standing a block from the onestory house that serves as the 
15man detachments headquarters and barracks 
the house is distinguished from its neighbors by greenandblack 
camouflage daub and sandbag positions at its corners 
there are too many people around here the market the school 
the church people who have nothing to do with the conflict and 
things happen to them rivera said 
sgt mario ventura lopez a stocky 51yearold former 
paratrooper commands the post a 32year army veteran ventura lost 
a lung from a wound suffered in combat with the rebels in 1982 
standing next to a patched hole in the wall where an antitank 
rocket struck in the previous attack ventura said his detachment 
was there to protect the community from these terrorist 
delinquents 
he estimated that about 100 rebels took part in the attack aug 
1 his troops were reinforced soon after it began by scores of 1st 
brigade soldiers on constant patrol around the san salvador 
volcanos base 
a uh1h helicopter with two m60 machineguns one of 70 
ussupplied choppers in the salvadoran air force circled about 
3000 feet above san ramon shortly after the battle began too high 
for its gunfire to be effective 
the helicopters arent coming in as close as they used to because 
the guerrillas have acquired several hundred sovietdesigned 
dragunov sniper rifles which have a range of 800 yards compared 
with about 300 yards for an ordinary assault rifle the helicopters 
have been taking more hits and abandoning more missions 
with government air power reduced the rebels have been able to 
launch more daytime attacks than at any time in the last four years 
of the conflict that began nearly a decade ago 
ventura contended his post is getting evergreater acceptance and 
support from the local people 
theyre tiring of seeing the way the terrorists actions affect 
the civilian population he said 
but a dozen residents interviewed indicated little or no 
animosity toward the attackers it was clear however they were 
sick of the war 
one asks oneself whey the two sides are fighting and one 
doesnt find an answer said a produce vendor who preferred not to 
give her name 
even rivera says he has nothing against the rebel who wounded him 
so severely 
it was just bad luck he said

in days past weddings in hamad badrs family 
called for the slaughter of 20 sheep but when a brother got married 
three months ago two were sacrifice enough 
the wedding was a victim of the 20month intefadeh or uprising 
against israeli occupation which has squeezed livelihoods and 
altered lives for palestinians throughout the west bank and gaza 
strip 
repeated strikes by palestinian workers curfews imposed by the 
israeli army and a drop in tourism have slashed incomes 
as the economy has declined the jordanian dinar the key 
currency in the occupied lands has plunged in value by 50 percent 
further ravaging savings and paychecks 
badr whose family has owned a fourtable restaurant in 
jerusalems walled old city for 25 years said his business has been 
devastated 
before if you wanted to get food youd have to wait outside 
for half an hour said badr who now closes for the day at noon to 
comply with the orders of clandestine uprising leaders 
today you see in a half an hour we sold only two cocacolas 
nearly all palestinians insist that the struggle for daily bread 
has not weakened their will to resist israeli occupation but the 
dinars recent plunge coincided with a seeming drop of intensity in 
the uprising and an increase in factional squabbling in palestinian 
ranks 
if you are angry and hungry you have to satisfy your hunger 
first explained tarik said who owns a photo shop near badrs 
restaurant 
but he said that rather than forcing an end to resistance more 
violence is the likely result 
an official of israels military government in the occupied lands 
said economic hardship was beginning to be felt in a widespread way 
for the first time but that it was too early to say it would mean an 
end to the uprising 
samir saleh an economist at the west banks bir zeit university 
said palestinian incomes have fallen and buying power is probably 
half what it was when the uprising began in december 1987 
average incomes per capita declined by 25 percent from a 
preuprising level of 1000 a month 
saleh said the falling value of the dinar has disastrous 
effects the currency has been a major means of payment and 
savings for palestinians since jordan lost the west bank to israel 
in 1967 
here people only believed in god and the dinar said nabil 
feidy a money changer on salah aldin st in east jerusalem 
the dinar was worth 3 early last year but fell to less than 1 
in july before recovering recently to about 150 
hospital workers college teachers islamic preachers and tens of 
thousands of private employees still earn wages in dinars and most 
paychecks have not risen as the dinars purchasing power declined 
sheik hassan ali an islamic preacher who dropped by to visit 
badr said he was forced to move his wife and two children out of 
their apartment and into a single room of his fathers house 
my salary is 160 dinars said ali noting that it used to be 
worth about 480 but now is worth 200 
the impact on people here is devastating said feidy the 
money changer the worst part is that people have their dinars in 
jordanian banks and they cant bring them 
in an effort to stem the flow of orders and money from the 
palestine liberation organization israel sharply curtailed travel 
and financial transfers across the jordan river palestinians can 
now bring in only 200 dinars a person per month 
israel has countered a tax boycott by palestinians with increased 
fees on vehicles 
abu jafaar a teacher who has seen his salary cut in half because 
of the frequent strikes and school closures said fees on his car 
have risen to the equivalent of about 700 a year from 80 
he has opened a small grocery store in his home 
the shop is not a way of living but it helps he said

every year scores of books are banned in schools 
and libraries across america usually at the behest of parents who 
find their contents offensive heres a look at some of the works 
that have been censored and the efforts by some writers and 
librarians to fight back 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this week more than 40 million public school children and 13 
million college students begin returning to their classrooms but in 
many of these halls of learning the shadow of censorship hangs over 
that source of light and knowledge the library 
freedom of speech and the press to write and to read whatever 
you like remains protected in america but those freedoms are 
frequently challenged public and school librarians often feel under 
siege 
books as seemingly harmless as mark twains huckleberry finn 
and l frank baums the wizard of oz have been challenged some 
of the mostfrequent targets are john steinbecks of mice and 
men kurt vonneguts slaughterhouse five and jd salingers 
catcher in the rye 
but as the school board in eliot maine said in rejecting a 
parental request to ban judy blumes novel forever as 
pornographic while you have the right to censor material for 
your child we do not believe you have that right for other children 
in the system 
its estimated that since johann gutenberg invented the printing 
press five centuries ago some 25 million individual books have been 
written and published almost a third in the english language 
worldwide an additional 350000 titles are published every year at 
least 50000 in the united states 
to house and protect this multiplicity of ideas the united 
states supports more than 115000 libraries of all kinds 
judith krug who writes and edits the american library 
associations newsletter on intellectual freedom chronicles those 
individuals and groups who attempt to remove those materials from 
public availability and accessibility 
this is a constitutional republic but the constitutional 
republic does not work unless the electorate is enlightened she 
said we are a nation of selfgovernors but in order to make 
appropriate decisions we need to have information available and 
accessible 
in three weeks authors and celebrities will visit bookstores and 
libraries across the country to read publicly excerpts from banned 
books as they did when salman rushdies the satanic verses 
raised such a furor 
in los angeles for instance pen center west an authors group 
will meet in malibu for readings of banned books among the invited 
are steve allen alice walker martin sheen ray bradbury hope 
lange alvin toffler larry king and billy crystal 
in the 198687 academic year people for the american way 
reported 153 attempts to remove books from public schools or 
libraries in 41 states 37 percent of them successful 
in the year ended may 1989 the american library association 
reported that more than 100 books were brought up on charges 
including jim davis garfield his nine lives 
that cartoon book was challenged in saginaw mich by a parent 
who found some of the language and drawings offensive 
said stephen james assistant director for the saginaw county 
public library it was intended to be a childrens book but some 
of the language was challenging 
a parent objected to one illustration davis had captioned she 
stormed she fumed she kicked ass the drawing depicts a woman 
kicking a man and sending him tumbling 
the library review committee decided to keep the book but in the 
adult section 
it has been a rough time for james and the saginaw libraries 
they received 11 challenges from may to december 1988 
the saginaw authorities reported to the library association 
although no evidence of an organized censorship effort has been 
found as yet the sheer number of challenges placed a clear 
burden on the library and to many seemed to suggest further 
trouble 
the first was larry kings tell it to the king the 
complainant resented what she felt was foul language and called it 
an insult to ones intelligence said james we decided to 
keep it on the shelves our librarians felt the quotes were 
wellhandled 
among those that followed were alice walkers pulitzer 
prizewinning novel the color purple and another childrens 
book katie morag and the tiresome ted by mairi hedderwick the 
story of a childs jealousy when a new baby arrives why the 
mothers breast is exposed as she holds a smiling baby but the baby 
is not suckling the complaint asked that the illustration be 
covered 
the woman who complained about sir gawain and the loathly 
lady by selina hasting found the book charming but asked the 
library to white out a sentence that contained profanity 
the librarys review committee could not find anything 
pornographic in public smiles private tears by helen van 
slyke or anything objectionable in king stork by howard pyle 
the review committee said 
howard pyle is a classic childrens author who was very much 
respected in his time his text reflects values and practices we now 
find repugnant in the same way that other classic books 
huckleberry finn legend of sleepy hollow dr doolittle 
little house on the prairie etc contain racist and sexist 
attitudes or words that belong to a bygone age mr pyle is true to 
the spirit of folklore in his original folktale 
saginaw received a complaint because the bible and books on 
christianity were shelved with books on myths and other religions 
but that is where the dewey decimal system places them 
what about a picture book for children named wheres waldo 
in which young readers scan through a busy page of a hundred or so 
small illustrations of tiny characters to find waldo he is either 
lost in the illustrations of people doing things at a track meet or 
a department store but among the illustrations one woman found a 
little boy peeking under a curtain at a woman in a department store 
dressing room as in the other cases the review committee refused 
to ban the book

he was he says the best and he has a fat 
scrapbook to back up the boast hyman pinky ginsberg the king 
of the gate crashers at age 84 isnt testing many ticket takers 
but he jokes that hes looking forward to his next big challenge 
st peter at the pearly gates 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
pinky ginsberg doesnt get around much 
anymore the days of dining with royalty infiltrating big events 
and thumbing his nose at officials are gone 
i dont know who remembers me anymore he says there was a 
time when they all knew me though there was a time when my name 
was magic 
the man who once walked into adolf hitlers office and asked for 
an autograph attended the coronation of king george vi crashed 37 
world series 12 presidential inaugurations eight olympics and many 
other events is a little short of magic these days 
hyman ginsberg 84 who bills himself as the worlds greatest 
gate crasher now spends his days in a tiny apartment on the edge of 
the french quarter 
an old mans gait has slowed his travels so has an old mans 
bankroll 
social security its enough to keep you from starving but not 
by much he says i get 400 a month and that doesnt go far in 
my time i made and lost 15 million i spent 100000 on a little 
redhead so quick you wouldnt believe it 
in those days it came easy and it went easy i was a bookie i 
owned several nightclubs in the french quarter chez paris on 
bourbon street that was mine i owned a place called punch and 
judys another one next to arnauds restaurant 
his thin fingers thumb through his scrapbook fondling the 
clippings that yellow there clippings in french spanish german 
english along with letters and photographs fill the book and 
testify to his many adventures 
the legend on the front of the book reads album of fantasy 
alright lets have it fantastic fabulous step amp peep into the 
wonderful world and the pleasant life of pinky the bum smiling 
pinky ginsberg king of the gate crashers international 
personality professional gourmet wine sipper and food taster 
the citations making him honorary mayor colonel senator 
sheriff cop and quarterback are taped to the wall 
i can document everything i tell you he says i have 
letters from people see this pin president bush sent it to me when 
he was vice president ive met 12 presidents crashed 12 
inaugurations i used to walk in and out of the white house like i 
owned the joint all i did was carry some papers under my arm and 
they thought i was a senator or something you cant do that now 
the assassinations changed all of that 
the last thing ginsberg crashed was the 1988 republican national 
convention 
easier than i would have guessed he says i just copied 
the pass and walked right in they put me through the metal detector 
to see if i was carrying a gun but nobody even tried to stop me 
ginsberg began his gatecrashing career at the world series in 
1920 
it was cleveland against brooklyn he says i came from a 
poor family and didnt have the 50 cents for a ticket i bought six 
newspapers for two cents each wadded them up and started a fire 
when the guy on the gate ran out to put it out i went in 
he crashed many other major sporting events he said super bowls 
nothing to it the muhammad alileon spinks fight in the 
superdome a piece of cake the 1988 ncaa final four in the 
same building couldnt keep him out either 
its just a matter of looking things over figuring out the 
best way in and them acting like you know what youre doing he 
says once you start dont stop and dont look back 
ginsberg was in berlin in 1939 and decided he had to get into 
adolf hitlers office with six white shirts which he says were 
hard to get in germany then he bribed two guards to turn their 
backs while he walked past 
i went in and there he was sitting at the desk ginsberg 
recalls now i sure didnt want to introduce myself with a name 
like hyman ginsberg so i just gave him a big heil hitler and 
asked for his autograph he hit the ceiling bells started going 
off a couple of guys came in and grabbed me and threw me out on the 
street 
he crashed king georges coronation in england wearing a rented 
tuxedo decorated with a yard of red ribbon and three rows of medals 
bought at a pawn shop the same ploy got him into the wedding of the 
daughter of spanish dictator francisco franco 
he got into a lot of sugar bowls and a couple of cotton bowls 
with a 2 camera and a press button he says he got off a coke 
machine 
but his best ploys wont work for him anymore he says nobody 
will believe an 84yearold firefighter or cop or doctor might be 
rushing into an event 
i always had an angle he says i had a knack for getting 
along with people and for getting by people if they had had 
television when i was in top form id be a household word today i 
was the best at one time everybody said so 
his career isnt over ginsberg says although he concedes time 
has turned against him and all the fancy security and electronic 
devices have made it harder for anyone to crash a gate 
if its big enough i could still come up with something i 
still like a challenge you know they tell me that st peter is a 
hard man to con and thats a hard gate to crash hell i guess ill 
give it a try though when the time comes

if some eastern bloc countries are undergoing 
reforms romania remains under the thumb of nicolae ceausescu whose 
staliniststyle government does not tolerate dissent indeed even 
with shortages of food and energy becoming more severe romania is 
shutting itself off from the outside world and foreigners inside 
the country are treated with suspicion 
</TEXT>

on a languid sunday in this onceglorious 
european city a foreign car is the center of attention as it pulls 
into the long evening shadow of the medieval cathedral 
from a safe distance people stare mindful of laws that mandate 
the reporting of any unauthorized conversations with foreigners 
a father leans over to his son muttering in english that the 
man behind the steering wheel is a driver 
a bolder spirit a welldressed woman approaches the strangers 
asking in flawless french if they will change some money she 
retreats crestfallen back into the shadows when they refuse 
in a nearby cafe a waitress wearily explains to the foreigners 
that there are no snacks no coffee no tea and no mineral water a 
familiar scenario across romania today 
just soc colored water that tastes of chemicals she says 
an aging band grinds out slow almost bluesy versions of 
hungarian ballads as unsmiling guests drown any sorrow in barely 
audible chatter and freeflowing cognac 
romania 1989 a european country where european visitors are an 
object of suspicion for authorities and mute curiosity for friendly 
but frightened citizens a polyglot nation where european cultures 
blended for centuries and now vanish behind official intolerance 
in cluj and other towns stylish but shoddily built apartments 
sprout in record time while old villages crumble away depopulating 
naturally as their lone stores and schoolhouses are closed 
across the fertile land rationing is in force and food stores 
grow barer with each year of the vaunted golden era of president 
nicolae ceausescu yet officials spouting statistics about romanias 
advances on the march to utopia blandly assure foreigners the meat 
they cannot see on shelves is available just stored in 
refrigerators 
last winter the fifth in a row of governmentimposed energy 
rationing six communists who once held senior posts implored 
ceausescu to change course 
romania is and remains a european country they insisted in a 
letter that later reached the west you started changing the 
geography of the countryside but you cannot remove romania to 
africa 
the 71yearold ceausescu the visibly healthy and unchallenged 
ruler since 1965 swiftly squashed the protest before it had any 
chance of spreading to other party members 
according to western diplomats in bucharest the six were 
repeatedly interrogated refusing to recant three were exiled 
outside the capital and the three others were removed from 
comfortable homes into rougher quarters in the city police guards 
reportedly prevent diplomats from approaching the new abodes 
mircea raceanu the adopted son of one of the six and a senior 
diplomat who served six years in the united states was arrested and 
charged with treason as media articles and rallies rammed home the 
dangers of contact with foreigners 
no one knows where raceanu is and a question about him clearly 
rattled officials at a news conference during the warsaw pact summit 
in bucharest in july 
authors of other protests share this anonymous fate according to 
romanian emigres and western diplomats former cluj university 
professor doina cornea has not been seen since june 6 following her 
third protest letter to ceausescu 
writers andrei plesu and mircea dinescu were under virtual house 
arrest after penning protests while another writer dan desliu 
spent two weeks in a bucharest madhouse for his dissent 
and the march to utopia continues cutting deep into the peasant 
traditions of romanians and into the culture and mutual tolerance 
nurtured for centuries by 17 million ethnic hungarians and 200000 
germans in the rolling hills of transylvania 
in german villages freshly painted lettering over courtyard 
gates proudly proclaims the family of the owner and the date the 
house was built in cluj hungarianlanguage theater and other 
cultures still thrive to judge by posters advertising the events 
but the citys hungarian consulate was closed last year in the 
escalating war of words between bucharest and budapest whose 
traditional rivalry over transylvania is exacerbated by sharp 
ideological divisions over the future shape of communism 
a cluj schoolteacher now in hungary one of thousands of such 
refugees from romania tearfully recalled how efforts to preserve 
vestiges of hungarian tradition in class were slowly eroded by 
reprimands and the appearance of more and more romanianspeaking

transylvanias ethnic germans hardworking farmers who have 
tilled the fertile soil for centuries are hemorrhaging out of the 
country at the rate of 13000 to 15000 a year and would go faster 
if romania let them 
fear of endangering this emigration once muted west german 
protest at romanias human rights record now bonn is as outspoken 
as other capitals emigration has not suffered diplomats say but 
the wife of the west german consul was brutally kicked and beaten by 
a uniformed policeman on a bucharest street this spring 
ceausescu is isolated too from most eastern bloc nations to 
visitors but not in articles soviet journalists based in bucharest 
make plain their distaste for a familiarly stalinist government 
they say they are watched and harassed by romanias kgb the dreaded 
securitate but insist open hostility would only ruin relations and 
any chance at helping to shape the countrys future 
ceausescu firmly believes his brand of stalinism offers more 
social security and marxist equality than mikhail gorbachevs 
topsyturvy reforms or hungarys open dash toward free elections and 
a free market economy 
as proof his supporters cite surreal statistics that living 
standards are 135 times higher than in 1945 that 675000 new 
apartments are available under this five year plan that industrial 
investments will increase 30 percent and the annual harvest surge 
from 30 million to 40 million tons a year by 1995 
failing to mention the cost in shortages caused by food exports 
from this bountiful land romanian officials boast of their unique 
feat of repaying the entire foreign debt 11 billion from 1980 to 
last march 
consumers have noticed no improvement in the stores since but 
their diet of propaganda proclaims proudly that for the first time 
in its turbulent history romania is beholden to no one 
credit for all this goes to ceausescu who is the object of a 
strong personality cult and has installed several close relatives 
including his wife elena son nicu and brother ilie in 
powerful positions 
the draft program for a november party congress describes him as 
the most beloved son of the romanian people the man of genius and 
architect of modern romania 
we can and must assert most powerfully that only socialism 
could make such grandiose and wonderful achievements of our nation 
possible ceausescu insisted at a communist party meeting in june 
private ownership small farms and the encouragement of 
profitseeking entrepreneurs he emphasizes are not communism 
neither are any attempts to denigrate socialism 
western diplomats in bucharest say ceausescu cites the massacre 
of prodemocracy demonstrators in china or the deaths of protesters 
in the soviet city of tbilisi as evidence that his policies are 
correct he does not kill so therefore criticism of romania over 
human rights is misplaced 
given the grip of the securitate and the disappearance of the 
leaders of a spontaneous protest by 10000 workers in november 1987 
it seems unlikely that popular unrest will erupt 
romania has weak democratic traditions a favorite proverb has 
it that a stooped back cannot be broken by a sword and outside 
influences that might stir mass protest are few 
ceausescu once an inveterate traveler courted in the white house 
and buckingham palace as a communist maverick has made no trips 
abroad this year and receives no top visitors from the west these 
days 
western diplomats report that even romanian officials or 
intellectuals once permitted carefully reported contacts with 
foreigners have all but stopped attending embassy parties 
there are no western or even soviet bloc newspapers broadly on 
sale and imports and hence contact with western businessmen are 
dwindling now that fresh foreign credit has been outlawed romanian 
tv works two hours a night on a heavy diet of ceausescu and the 
more interesting offerings from bulgarian yugoslav soviet or 
hungarian television can be received or understood only on the 
nations fringes 
its just becoming a dinosaur of a country if you like says 
a western diplomat who asked not to be identified 
a romanian official counters we had to cut ourselves off 
when youre getting beaten from all sides you withdraw to a 
place where its safe he adds smiling well see whos right

could a welsh prince and his followers have 
settled in the heartland of america three centuries before 
christopher columbus reached the new world thats the stuff of 
local legend in southern indiana while most scholars debunk the 
theory a lot of questions remain unanswered and much of the 
evidence has disappeared 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on a rugged bluff overlooking the ohio 
river a site known locally as the devils backbone natural 
debris accumulated over the centuries shrouds a historical mystery 
popular legend says that there lie the remains of a large stone 
fort and a lost colony of welshmen who sailed to america three 
centuries before christopher columbus 
in 1799 early settlers found six skeletons wearing breastplates 
with a welsh coat of arms indian legends told of yellowhaired 
giants who settled in kentucky southern indiana southern ohio 
and tennessee a region they knew as the dark and forbidden 
land 
archaeologists debunking the legend say better evidence 
indicates native american indians once conducted a vigorous trading 
network nearby and buried their dead on the bluff 
the site and its shadowy history has lain virtually undisturbed 
since 1940 when the us army purchased 10000 acres to build a 
munitions plant 
the department of defense is expected to relinquish almost 900 
acres as part of a costcutting plan the state of indiana will have 
the first option to buy 
both the charlestown chamber of commerce and the state department 
of natural resources have called for a state park on the land which 
includes the peninsula 3 miles east of charlestown 
the older folks told children not to scale its walls that the 
devil had put a curse on the place wrote margaret sweeney in her 
1967 book fact fiction and folklore of southern indiana 
in spite of the warning many youngsters invaded the stronghold 
and came away with broken bones bruises cuts or even completely 
bewitched for investigating old scratchs quarters 
fourteen miles upstream from louisville ky the craggy hill 
rises abruptly from the indiana shoreline fourteen mile creek runs 
behind the hill creating a narrow strip of land where it flows 
along the larger river 
the peninsula is less than 20 feet wide at the top and falls off 
abruptly on either side to the ohio river and the creek the 
resulting pearshape bluff has a flat top of 5 to 7 acres that is 
almost inaccessible 
the earliest survey of the area by state geologist et cox and 
his assistant william borden in 1873 revealed a prehistoric 
fortification on the hilltop an artificial limestone wall 150 feet 
long and 75 feet high in some places stood along the front and one 
side of the hill where the cliffs could be scaled cox said in his 
report 
the walls no longer exist the areas early settlers having 
carried the huge unmortared stones away to build foundations 
bridges and fences seen throughout the countys rolling countryside 
local legend says the walls were built by followers of prince 
madoc who led an expedition away from his native wales in the late 
12th century and was never seen again oral tradition says they 
landed in america settling briefly in tennessee before moving on to 
kentucky and southern indiana 
in my opinion you couldnt find a better legend than this 
says dana olson of jeffersonville an amateur historian and author 
of prince madoc founder of clark county indiana 
youve got princes and kings and gold and silver and wars it 
would make a great movie 
olsons book says madoc was a son of welsh king owain gwynedd and 
one of his brightest naval commanders madocs skills and curiosity 
took him to france spain venice and other mediterranean ports 
and on at least two trips to the americas in the period from 1165 to 
1169 
when gwynedd died in 1169 his sons began to feud over the 
throne a disgusted madoc looking for more tranquil surroundings 
sailed from lundy island south of wales with three of his brothers 
and 10 ships 
they are listed as missing in britains ancient maritime logs 
legend says they landed in mobile bay in 1170 and traveled up the 
alabama river to where it meets the coosa river close to alabamas 
borders with georgia and tennessee 
according to cherokee tradition they settled there and 
intermarried with native indians building five stone forts in the 
chattanooga area treasure hunters have found roman coins european 
oil lamps and goblets among the forts olson says 
however excavations conducted by the anthropology department at 
the university of tennessee concluded one of the structures known 
as old stone fort was built in the third century ad by an indian 
culture that would have predated madoc 
no welsh artifacts were found to substantiate the persistent 
madoc legend

in professional archaeological circles its kind of 
poohpoohed says steve cox curator of the tennessee state 
museum theres no archaeological evidence thats really all that 
we have to go on in the prehistoric period 
the legend says the welsh indians were forced out of tennessee by 
the cherokee indians three separate northerly routes took them into 
kentucky and the ohio river valley 
american indians apparently first spread the tale of a race of 
white indians who lived in the falls of the ohio area where madocs 
followers may have established their largest settlement 
george rogers clark the founder of clarksville ind first 
heard the story from tobacco a chief of the piankeshaws he told of 
a great battle between the red indians and white indians on the ohio 
rivers sand island where all the white indians were slain 
maj john harrison among others has told of an extensive 
graveyard in that area where thousands of human bones were buried 
in such confusion as to suggest a battle the graveyard if it 
existed has been washed away 
some of clark countys earliest settlers reportedly found ancient 
coins and european armor some bearing the welsh coat of arms all 
of that armor has disappeared 
clark found some skeletons adorned in armor that he thought were 
ancient welshmen and jotted down his findings in his personal 
memoirs olson says a copy of this book in clarks own hand was 
stolen years ago from the jeffersonville public library 
bairds history of clark county says that a tombstone with 
the date 1186 was found in jeffersonville in the 1800s early 
pioneers reportedly found native indians throughout the interior who 
could converse in the welsh language 
a skull taken from sand island in the 1800s was pronounced by a 
dr beckwith as not that of an indian beckwiths qualifications 
are not known 
none of the evidence has been scientifically examined or 
confirmed in fact virtually all of it has mysteriously disappeared 
i wish i could reproduce everything thats been found or that 
it had been put in a museum olson says there are no museums 
here 
without such proof archaeologists and other experts have their 
doubts 
where you find prehistoric or human occupation you normally 
find a range of evidence such as refuse garbage settlements 
villages sites artifacts says gary ellis senior archaeologist 
for the state of indiana 
there just isnt any most of it is rumor 
more likely indian scholars say the stone fort was built by 
native american indians 
a lot of people dont like to believe the indians could have 
stacked rocks that size but theres evidence around the country 
they did things like that says donna calhoun of rural scottsburg 
who is writing a history of indians in southern indiana 
ray white tribal chairman of the miami indian nation suggested 
the coins lamps armor and other artifacts could easily have 
traveled inland via the indian trading network a diary calhoun 
uncovered during her research locates an indian trading post 1 
miles east of charlestown 
yet olson says the evidence supporting the legend is overwhelming 
what something like this does is alter the apple cart of 
history olson says anytime you get all this and put it before 
all these people whove got degrees in anthropology it really turns 
the table they dont know how to combat it so they say no this 
is a myth 
an archaeological overview done in 1984 predicted the research 
value of devils backbone could be quite high under federal law 
any indian mounds and artifacts must be protected from development 
there 
they could provide a unique look into southern indianas early 
beginnings 
or they could lend credence to a legend and shatter accepted 
theories on the discovery and exploration of america 
we need somebody to go into charlestown and just do a survey 
white says they really need to find out whats there 
its bound to tell something about the early early indiana 
history before what theyre teaching in the schools its very 
important

the roman catholic church fighting on the one 
hand to encourage legislation against abortion is beginning to 
offer a consoling hand to those catholic women who have had 
abortions project rachel is that beginning 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the 24yearold woman with a substance 
abuse problem came to stephen lynott for help 
she was pregnant alone and angry after being abandoned by her 
boyfriend and thrown out of her parents home recalls lynott 
director of catholic social services for the marquette diocese 
while counseling the woman lynott found out she had ended two 
earlier pregnancies part of her substance abuse problem came from 
her effort to erase the painful memory of the abortions 
because of her abortions lynott says the woman expected 
condemnation from the roman catholic church instead she was 
surprised to find compassion 
it might have been condemnation before 1985 when the diocese 
began a program to teach counselors and priests how to help women 
who have had abortions 
named for a biblical story about a woman who grieved inconsolably 
for her children project rachel treats women more like mourners 
than sinners 
before that an average of one or two catholic women a month who 
defied church opposition to abortion came to lynotts agency for 
help counselors unaware of the womens abortions sometimes were 
unable to spot what was troubling them 
we didnt know how to begin lynott says it was an utterly 
foreign concept 
vickie thorn the founder of the first project rachel which 
began in the archdiocese of milwaukee in 1984 says feelings of 
remorse arent confined to catholic women 
i dont think its catholic guilt she says i think its 
just generic human guilt 
the national conference of catholic bishops endorsed the concept 
of postabortion reconciliation services such as project rachel in 
1985 according to the rev john gouldrick director of the bishops 
prolife office 
at least 60 catholic dioceses in the united states have started 
project rachel programs because of estimates that as many as 30 
percent of catholic women have had abortions mrs thorn says its 
about the same proportion as the general population she added 
howard hoeflein a spokesman for the archdiocese of detroit says 
the numbers arent surprising despite the churchs position that 
abortion except to save the life of the mother is a serious sin 
usually when a decision on abortion is made it is within a 
framework of a lot of pressures being exerted on the woman 
hoeflein says the church is just one element it may be a 
situation that is overwhelming 
what were trying to do is make sure because of one bad 
decision they dont just throw away the stabilizing influence of 
the church on the rest of their lives 
lynott says we had one woman who came in the day after her 
abortion it was a very very tough situation another woman waited 
20 years youre dealing with awareness and youre dealing with 
denial what triggers that what opens that door you cant really 
predict 
some want to talk about their experience and thats a very 
gutwrenching experience some are right up front they know where 
their pain is the younger clients you may have to dig a little bit 
more 
prochoice organizations say they doubt many women are modernday 
rachels who regret ending their pregnancies 
the guilt they feel is guilt society imposes on them and the 
catholic church are masters at imposing guilt on women says kate 
michelman executive director of the national abortion rights action 
league 
to try and cause women to feel guilt when they have already had 
to struggle with such a difficult situation is in fact 
antichristian 
raised as a catholic but no longer an active member of the 
church michelman had an abortion after bearing three children 
what i ended up feeling guilty about was not feeling guilty 
she says i made one of the most moral decisions i ever made in my 
life 
a study published in 1974 indicated that up to 91 percent of 
women report a sense of relief following abortion while a 1976 
study indicated that up to 98 percent had no regrets and would make 
the same choice again she says 
project rachel counselors say that husbands boyfriends and 
grandparents feeling anger or guilt over a family members 
abortion also call as do noncatholics 
mrs thorn says eating disorders substance abuse and inability 
to mother children later are often linked to an earlier abortion 
but michelman says the us surgeon general found no evidence that 
women suffer psychological or emotional problems after abortion 
while some seek professional counseling through the program 
others ask to talk to a sympathetic priest to seek forgiveness mrs 
thorn says they want to get straight with god 
mrs thorn says priests routinely heard confessions of such women 
but before project rachels training were unprepared to help deal 
with grief guilt and the need to forgive themselves 
it flies in the face of what is expected of the catholic 
church she says everybody assumes all we have done is say this 
is terrible terrible terrible and done nothing else 
steve rall parish social ministry director for the lansing 
diocese says he was impressed by a recent project rachel conference 
it was the first time i had met with a group of prolife people 
where they were not angry and bitter he says this was a chance

no matter they might drive to their rendezvous in 
a highpowered highpriced car no matter they may spend thousands 
on their guns knives and tents when they meet they exchange 
ritual handshakes and hugs and for the next few days they relive 
the life of mountain men 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they have a heavyduty look muskets slung 
over their shoulders a full growth of beard knives in their belts 
a competitive glint in the eye their wives sew 
they call themselves mountain men the likes of jim bridger joe 
meeks william sublette jim beckwourth men who wrestled grizzlies 
lived indianstyle before their mountains came under the protection 
of the stars and stripes and the us cavalry 
theyre out there now shades of the early 1800s every weekend 
thousands of them a reborn subculture that one expert says may 
rival the rodeo in popularity 
they meet in something called a rendezvous an encampment a 
transient community of tepees lodges and tents although why it is 
called by a french term is somewhat murky 
patrick mccarthy an assistant professsor of film and television 
at the university of northern colorado here estimates as many as 
250000 people have attended rendezvous across the united states 
dressing up as trappers traders and their female companions 
one million to 3 million people he estimates have visited 
rendezvous as guests their popularity has blossomed coasttocoast 
with as many as 30 rendezvous a year held in colorado alone 
every indication i have is that the mountain man subculture is 
growing mccarthy says it hasnt reached its peak yet 
maybe its the appeal of the wilderness and the simplicity of the 
lifestyle or maybe its a subconscious yearning for the days when 
men were men and got away with it whatever it is there they are 
facing off with nature in the 20th century clad in animal skins or 
other 19th centurystyle clothing made of wool cotton or linen 
the rendezvous is often an outdoor bazaar where firestarting 
kits knives guns and clothing can be bought or bartered for 
blacksmiths working at crude forges craft blades candlestick 
holders and cookware 
and there is a competitive edge with shootouts knife and 
tomahawkthrowing contests and days end around the ceremonial 
campfire for a group meal 
there is a ritualistic greeting usually a double handshake which 
is an ordinary handshake followed by a thumbshake and that is 
usually followed by a hug called a squoze which is then followed 
by the question did you winter well 
rendezvous originally were held in the west for trappers to 
replenish supplies enjoy whiskey hauled from the east and send 
their years supply of pelts back to civilization where beaver was 
in great demand for gentlemens top hats 
mccarthy whose dark shoulderlength hair and heavy beard show 
hints of gray says he moved here a year ago because colorado 
geographically is the center of the mountain man subculture im 
here primarily because of my research interest 
mccarthys doctoral dissertation concerned the mountain man 
subculture and he has published several articles on the subject 
this summer he is teaching a journalism workshop called mountain 
man subculture 
mccarthy says the 19thcentury mountain man was a mercantile 
capitalist who lived a scavenger lifestyle his halcyon years were 
from 1825 to 1840 that was when the mountain man was at his peak 
activity 
he lived off a raw undeveloped hostile west sparsely populated 
by nomadic indians his tools were traps knives and rifles his 
rugged lifestyle became the subject of 40 or more movies 
the reborn mountain man subculture began flourishing in the 
1970s some of the interest sparked by the nations bicentennial 
mccarthy says 
it is a weaponsminded subculture there are displays of guns 
and knives competition is built around the weapons shooting a 
gun is an act of dominance he says 
a modern mountain man may invest 1000 or more in his weaponry 
clothing and rendezvous living quarters 
mccarthy attends rendezvous as an interested but detached 
observer when necessary he interviews some of the mountain men 
one of his first questions is why are you here 
almost invariably he says the answer is camaraderie 
the escapist weekend activities may be fueled as the 21st century 
approaches 
one way to put off the future is to retreat to the past 
mccarthy says maybe its a regressive activity were not ready 
to step into the 21st century 
what does the mountain man represent democratic ideals of 
individuality and freedom no one was more free and 
individualistic mccarthy says 
ron melchert a retired army officer who operates a gunsmith shop 
in penrose colo is a modernday mountain man who is known at the 
rendezvous as blind squirrel 
he started as a shooting competitor 
i like it dressing up and organized shoots because it is 
familyoriented melchert said the kids are included 
people come for different reasons mccarthy says they may 
come to shoot trade or just picnic on a saturday afternoon 
some are more serious mountain men they feel they are the most 
authentic 
rendezvous vary in size from the 30000 people who meet annually 
at fort bridger wyo to gatherings of only a few 
two other large events are the green river rendezvous in 
pinedale wyo and the rocky mountain men rendezvous in jefferson 
colo 
they are organized by a wide range of groups and individuals 
ranging from the national muzzleloading rifle association to 
ranchers 
the outings produce some incongruities for instance the lincoln 
continental parked next to a tepee at lost park colo 
but for the most part the mountain men insulate themselves from 
the outside world as one told his wife when she said she was going 
into town to buy a newspaper i dont need no newspaper im at 
the rendezvous

after being fired on her last outing joan 
rivers was wary when she was offered a chance to be host of a new 
television talk show 
she got over it 
her new venture the joan rivers show premieres tuesday as 
an afternoon tv magazine with a heavy emphasis on gossip 
the comedian was fired in 1987 from the late show the 
inaugural series on fox broadcasting after an eightmonth feud over 
low ratings 
i was so burned on my previous show i was so leery of things 
that i called geraldo rivera says rivers whose new show and 
geraldo are both produced by tribune entertainment co 
i said tell me the truth are they gentlemen are they 
honorable do they stand behind their word otherwise i dont need 
this again he came over to my apartment in new york and we talked 
for an hour he said go with them 
rivers calls her new show an alternative to geraldo 
oprah and donahue 
i dont want to do those shows she says you can only 
watch so much about crossdressing my shows going to be 
entertaining well have personalities and gossip well have some 
issues well get into the pros and cons of abortion mainly it 
will be a magazine with four segments but no recipes hey look at 
these hands 
im going to do the book reviews i couldnt do at night im 
going to bring out the cystic fibrosis parents i couldnt have on 
before its going to be what interests me 
sure im going to ask outrageous questions sometimes you get 
some unexpected answers im not creating any new art form nor do i 
see why i need to pat sajak and oprah winfrey didnt have to create 
a new format 
rivers was the permanent substitute host for nbcs tonight 
show when she quit in 1986 to challenge her mentor johnny carson 
with a new latenight show that was the first offering of foxs new 
fourth network carson protested bitterly that he learned of her 
departure on the day her fox show was announced 
the late show made a highly publicized debut oct 9 1986 
and after some initial curiosity from viewers quickly sank into the 
ratings oblivion that has been the fate of most carson competitors 
rivers left the show after the may 15 1987 telecast and was 
replaced by a series of rotating hosts the final host of the late 
show was arsenio hall who later created his own syndicated late 
night show that is now seen on 160 stations nationwide 
rivers says fox promised advertisers and its affiliate stations a 
62 rating for the late show which was unrealistic the show 
actually delivered numbers that were only about half of that 
they pulled the number out of the air she says they had 
nothing else on the air the star was held accountable and it was 
all founded on quicksand 
going over past ground at this point is fruitless says brad 
turell senior vice president for fox broadcasting co we wish her 
the best of luck shes very talented and we think shell do very 
well with her new show 
rivers husband edgar rosenberg took his own life with a drug 
overdose in august 1987 she says she feels problems with the fox 
show and his ill health contributed to his death 
the carson thing is behind me rivers says the fox thing 
is behind me the tragedy is the death of my husband the rest is 
all nonsense i met edgar through carson its almost like a chapter 
closed with edgars death 
the new onehour show originating in new york will be sent 
daily by satellite to 130 stations 
rivers who has lived in los angeles for 18 years has moved to 
new york 
im keeping my place in california we were here for 18 years 
i said with edgars death i was going back home then you realize 
you have major ties that you dont want to break 
edgar was the brains before its been an interesting two 
years im doing things now that i thought id never do i have to 
read the contracts now theres no one to bounce things off of

theres a big difference say douglas bernstein 
and denis markell between writing for a small stage and the small 
screen 
on television you write a joke then someone else decides if 
its funny or not says markell the bearded bespectacled member 
of an upandcoming writing team that at one time turned out tv 
scripts for the likes of ricky schroeder on silver spoons and 
for a shortlived fairy tale sitcom called the charmings 
everything goes up a level to that someone else and gets 
rewritten then up another level and rewritten and up a third level 
and rewritten bernstein adds consequently when you put names 
of your own friends in the script by the time it gets on the air 
the names are the friends of the producer 
in our revue showing off weve got all our friends names in 
it and nobody can change them he says with a laugh 
with their own show bernstein and markell are helping to 
resuscitate a neglected theatrical art form the topical musical 
comedy revue at one time new york embraced those bright witty 
little shows productions such as ben bagleys shoestring revue 
and his salute to cole porter or julius monks entertainments at the 
plaza and upstairs at the downstairs 
the revue puts such a premium on the words and the wit and 
thats something that tends to get lost on broadway today says 
bernstein who also is one of the shows four performers the 
revue asks an audience to sit down and pay attention if you blink 
or turn away you sometimes miss the whole premise of a song 
showing off currently running in a small upper west side 
nightspot called steve mcgraws pokes fun at a variety of current 
topics although dont look for jokes about such easy targets as 
donald trump dan quayle or leona helmsley 
among its more unusual subjects are showbiz rabbis video rental 
addiction new yorks 72nd street a man who has a crush on a local 
television anchorwoman and what bernstein and markell call 
sip those selfimportant people like maitre ds telephone 
receptionists and box office personnel who enjoy their moments of 
control over everybody else 
we dont take the audience for granted markell says we 
assume that they come to the show with a certain amount of 
intelligence and we dont insult them rather than making an 
audience scared it makes them feel like they are contributing to 
the show 
the collaboration between markell and bernstein is unusual both 
men write music and lyrics they dont divide the tasks so there is 
a lot of trading back and forth of ideas 
music is a lot harder to write together bernstein says 
and after its done you dont know who did what 
who decides what the final version will be 
in showing off we have a wonderful director michael 
leeds bernstein says the director for us has always served 
as the ultimate referee 
although only in their early 30s both men were steeped in the 
traditions of musical comedy 
denis and i were both lucky enough to be brought up by parents 
who valued and respected the revue form bernstein recalls his 
father wrote for hotel revues in the 1950s markells father was a 
television producer as well as a set designer in the early days of 
new york television 
we listened to recordings of revues and were always told look 
who wrote these songs this is where sheldon harnick and jerry bock 
wrote their songs this is where harvey schmidt and tom jones wrote 
their songs and look what they went on to do bernstein adds 
weve always viewed the musical revue as a not very distant source 
for a lot of the great musical writers 
bernstein and markell met some 15 years ago at a music camp in 
raymond maine where they would write ditties like the bassoon 
teachers birthday the two would sit on the main porch at the 
camps lodge and talk about current films such as blazing 
saddles or favorite comics such as woody allen and robert klein 
and make fun of the other kids at camp 
both writers attended amherst college in massachusetts where they 
created a series of satirical revues among their performers was 
prince albert of monaco he played a frog who turned into a 
prince bernstein says 
they came to new york in the fall of 1980 markell ended up at 
the bmi workshop a training ground for aspiring musical theater 
writers guided at that time by the legendary conductor lehman engel 
and later by such theater people as maury yeston ed kleban and alan 
mencken 
a year later the two were working for director martin charnin of 
annie fame he was looking for young unknown writers to 
contribute material to a revue upstairs at oneals 
they wrote two of its brightest numbers something a parody 
of a song called nothing from a chorus line and mommas 
turn a number supposedly sung by the mothers of new york drama 
critics 
a chance to work in television and films lured them to california 
in 1986 
we were lucky because an agent had seen a sample script of 
ours markell says and told us come out to california 
for eight months they learned the discipline of television 
writing working on a schedule and reacting quickly to change 
but their hearts belonged in new york and they returned an early 
draft of showing off was done in early 1987 and evolved into the 
current production two years later now they are writing the book 
and lyrics for a hbo project that will have music by marvin 
hamlisch but showing off is still on their minds there may be 
los angeles and chicago editions of the show with new material 
tailored to those two cities 
we are determined to make the show feel specific so that the 
audience would feel that they were at a special place bernstein 
says but at the same time we try to tackle issues and themes like 
the man who has the crush on the tv anchorwoman which are really 
broader so its not really limited to new york

germans hold the edge in such 
things as fast cars beer and sauerbraten and now theyre claiming 
the edge in fashions 
german fashions no 1 in europe ahead of the french and the 
italians 
german fashion has the same reputation as german food its 
actually good but everyone thinks of it as bland and fattening 
herwig zahm head of mondi apparel near munich remarked at a recent 
fashion fair in duesseldorf a new european fashion mecca in the 
heart of west germanys industrial heartland 
no one questions that the west germans have become leading 
exporters of womens wear but the french and italians have 
something to say about the germans becoming no 1 in europe maybe 
they turn out clothes but do they design and create 
for years styleconscious buyers associated continental chic with 
the established couturiers of paris and milan where famed fashion 
houses like chanel and armani turn out their twice yearly 
collections to the accolades of the rich and famous 
now with an expanding world market of wellpaid professional 
women and globetrotting tourists west german designers say they 
are upstaging their foreign rivals with the right mix of panache and 
pragmatism 
duesseldorfs showings may not draw princess caroline of monaco 
or the actress catherine deneuve but royals and other 
discriminating clientele have applauded west german fashions with 
their pocketbooks if not their presence 
the german designers also point to the sharp rise in interest 
among foreign buyers for germanmade clothing shoes cosmetics and 
jewelry aimed at the uppermiddle income brackets 
our exports are very high and increasing each year which shows 
that our reputation is growing said claudia timm spokeswoman for 
duesseldorfs sprawling igedo fashion market that has given focus to 
design centers scattered throughout west germany 
nearly a third of the 13 billion in west german apparel 
manufactured last year was exported and the foreign sales account 
for an even larger share of output this year according to the 
colognebased womens outerwear association 
salamander shoes of kornwestheim is europes largest producer of 
footwear and klaus steilmanns motto fashion for millions not 
millionaires has made him the continental king of contemporary 
sportswear with nearly 640 million in annual sales 
the west germans contend it is their attention to quality and 
marketing that has won them the no 1 rank in performance in europe 
if not in repute 
the french have all the image but they dont have a product 
anymore said wolfgang ley president of munichbased escada firm 
that expects to sell 400 million in exclusive apparel this year 
the designers create a couture line but the managers leave it 
to any manufacturer to produce a readytowear line he added 
some of what is being produced under very famous labels is 
absolute junk 
leys company for which his swedishborn wife margaretha is 
chief designer posted a phenomenal 40 percent sales increase in 
1988 and has seen an even brisker sales pace so far this year 
we design our own fabrics and our own color stories ley 
said we make our own market and give it a direction we dont 
wait around to see how the wind is blowing 
in france jacques mouclier president of the french federation 
of couturiers said ley is right in saying frenchdesigned clothes 
are made in other countries but he maintained paris remains no 1 
in fashion 
france long ago won the battle in terms of creation design 
he said we have the designers the reputation around the world 
the best proof of that is the number of people who come to our shows 
every season why the number of accredited journalists comes to 
2000 we not only have french designers showing their creations 
but also japanese italian and american because the capital of 
fashion is paris and it will remain so for paris is open and 
generous to the creative spirit 
the major italian fashion houses in milan were closed for 
vacation and officials could not be reached for comment 
but italian fashion experts have maintained in the past that 
while the west germans have made inroads in the more economically 
priced womens clothes their fashion is less stylized than italian 
readytowear and high fashion garments 
the west germans use names like escada mondi and tuzzi which 
conjure a mediterranean image and that is part of the strategy of 
those designing for an international customer 
zahm and ley said they chose easily uttered names with a 
international ring to add flair to their image 
mondi sells 213 million in clothing each year and counts among 
its customers the princess diana wife of britains prince charles 
she caused a run on the firms designer socks in 1985 after wearing 
them to a polo match and still places regular orders with mondi 
each season for this fall she ordered a wardrobe of burgundy black 
and vanilla 
jil sander of hamburg has captured another impressive corner of 
the upmarket with classic styles subtle colors and natural fabrics 
that pack well and wear long enough to justify their highend price 
tags 
you can start with a few pieces and build up a basic wardrobe 
over the years said miss sander a slender 45yearold who still 
models for some of her advertisements thats much less costly 
than getting a lot of clothes and having no style 
her clothes are produced in west germany and shown exclusively at 
the fall and spring fashion fairs in milan 
many west german firms have begun farming out some of their 
production to eastern europe and other countries where wages are 
lower 
womens outerwear associated reported a 22 percent increase in 
outofcountry preparations last year although the share accounts 
for only about 5 percent of total production 
designers of exclusive sportswear like miss sander and ley 
contend production costs concern them less than maintaining quality 
and they plan to continue overseeing their operations close to home 
but for the broader field of clothing producers competing for the 
middleincome market contracting out to eastern europe or 
mediterranean countries is likely to become an attractive means of 
cutting costs 
another west german success story is karl lagerfeld who 
continues to boost his countrymens image although he has switched 
to the paris house of chanel 
lagerfeld still markets the kl line from west germany and retains 
a showroom and boutique at the igedo market 
part of the attraction for west german designers to the more 
renowned fashion capitals is likely the glitz and glamor that 
duesseldorf lacks despite its better balance sheet 
those things probably matter that french designers show up 
with their beautiful people ley noted but the princess of 
wales sneaks into our boutique in london at least twice a season 
they dont go to the shows but we have the princes and queens of 
europe buying escada

singer natalie coles i do is climbing the 
rhythm n blues charts 
and on sept 17 shell say i do to record producer andre 
fischer in a wedding ceremony in los angeles 
ive got my gown i never had a wedding gown before i didnt 
have a traditional wedding the first time 
fischer was the original drummer and founder of the rampb group 
rufus with chaka khan he and cole met about 15 years ago at a tokyo 
music festival 
chaka and i became friends she said i had no idea he 
fischer liked me 
last october i received a call from one of my background 
singers that andre had some material he wanted to submit i later 
found out what he really wanted was a date he was very cool and a 
little shy i figured it was going to be a business relationship 
and it was for several months 
we did work on the good to be back album he arranged and 
produced matter of fact and gonna make you mine 
in january i was performing in lake tahoe and he called would 
it be ok if he came to see the show and he wanted to bring his 
children he has three i said sure 
he told me hed been in love with me 15 years cole said 
fischer proposed after her 39th birthday in february 
cole has been on a 40city tour since july promoting her new 
good to be back album of midtempo ballads on emi records in a 
recent relaxed happy interview she said its her first such tour 
in at least seven years 
the song i do is a duet with freddie jackson it is a 
gettingmarried song freddie told me his sister is getting married 
and wants to play it at her wedding it is definitely a love 
ballad 
on her tour coles cousin eddie sings it with her her father 
nat king cole had three brothers ike freddie and the late 
eddie sr all were singers 
coles first husband was marvin yancey coproducer of her first 
album inseparable which won her grammy awards in 1976 as best 
new artist and best rhythm n blues female vocal performance for

the good to be back album isnt a comeback album it refers 
to coles 1987 everlasting album her first for emi which was a 
comeback and was a success the biggest single from it was pink 
cadillac 
i think rock fans were a little upset she said thats by 
their buddy bruce springsteen how could i do a song he wrote he 
must have hated it because i never heard a word 
her album dangerous on modern records in 1985 was her first 
since going through drug rehabilitation six years ago that album 
was ok it wasnt a big deal but it was better than some things i 
had done that was a very difficult time for me 
even though she knows how bad addiction can be cole doesnt give 
advice about drugs you can advise all day long and it doesnt 
mean anything i was advised kids are going to do what theyre 
going to do 
but she does have advice for parents you try to show them the 
road if kids are brought up with a lot of animosity friction and 
noncommunication where everybody walks around holding everything 
inside youre going to get in trouble she said we need to 
keep the line of communication open with young people my biggest 
concern as a parent is that my son will be able to talk to me 
kids in the era i was brought up in werent allowed to talk 
about certain things it wasnt right to have certain thoughts going 
on in your head youd feel guilty if you brought them up to your 
mom or your dad i found my answers outside of the home which isnt 
the greatest place to experiment 
about her son 11yearold robbie she says i want him to have 
an education im glad i got my education in spite of all the 
things ive been through the bottom line is i know im educated 
intelligent i can speak well express myself i can mingle i dont 
have to feel ostracized in any kind of group 
with education my children might even be able to stand out 
she said their education will be such that they can move around 
and see the world i had that opportunity and i would want the same 
thing for them 
we should upgrade our education system and put more money into 
it these days you want to send your kid to private school if you 
can afford it it shouldnt be like that

peter elkinds new book the death 
shift is precisely what it purports to be a true and troubling 
account of every parents worst nightmare and more 
what could be worse than a psychopathic nurse entrusted with the 
lives of children too young to know or tell that someone is secretly 
trying to kill them 
the answer only a medical community too timid or too callous to 
expose the killer for fear of scandal or lawsuits 
elkind tells the story of licensed vocational nurse genene jones 
and her reign of medical terror first at the pediatric intensive 
care unit of san antonios premier public hospital and later at a 
small private clinic in nearby kerrville 
although convicted of killing only one child and injuring 
another nurse jones apparently played a deadly role in the illness 
and deaths of a number of other children and while associates and 
administrators suspected the worst or at least should have they 
did little or nothing to stop her 
the death shift will make the hair on the back of your neck 
stand on end says author gary cartwright elkinds colleague at 
texas monthly magazine this tale of a maniacally evil nurse and 
the duplicity of the medical community is a master stroke of 
investigative journalism and a literary accomplishment this is 
pulitzer material 
elkind an associate editor weaves a story that at once 
horrifies and infuriates 
the death shift viking 1995 traces jones past from a 
troubled erratic childhood through a series of illfated romances 
to her employment at bexar county hospital in 1978 
elkind uncovers awesome evidence of jones emotional instability 
up to and beyond that point but suggests that a feigned or 
psychosomatic illness in march 1981 signaled the beginning of the 
nightmare 
what had emerged he wrote was a nurse with a strange attraction 
to medicine who was unable to distinguish between true illness and 
imagined calamity 
that nurse was then set loose in a hospital to care for the most 
helpless of human beings where all the warning signs were ignored 
her firing from a previous hospital job her history of lies her 
onthejob errors her inability to admit mistakes her 
unwillingness to follow orders her exaggerated sense of her 
abilities her need to be in control and her desperate craving for 
attention 
for a while genene jones would be satisfied to point out 
medical problems that didnt exist elkind observed it was only 
a matter of time before that would no longer be enough 
the trouble began in mid1981 with a series of inexplicable 
emergencies in the pediatric intensive care unit at bexar county 
hospital now called medical center hospital a 17 million link in 
the vast university of texas medical system 
babies were suddenly dying and almost always on the 311 pm 
shift when jones was on duty 
as the crisis escalated the hospital quietly conducted an 
internal investigation and confronted the unimaginable prospect that 
one of its nurses was actually killing infants 
no one ever would know exactly how many babies died from lethal 
injections administered by jones but an estimate much later would 
run as high as 16 elkind reports 
unable to admit that even to themselves and fearful of bad 
publicity and lawsuits the hospital said nothing to the police or 
the district attorney it chose instead to remove jones by 
upgrading the icu staff he writes 
but the nightmare did not end there 
armed incredibly with a good recommendation from the hospital 
jones moved on to a private pediatricians clinic in the nearby 
texas hill country overnight the deadly pattern began again 
in fact jones had accompanied a doctor named kathy holland from 
the san antonio hospital to kerrville where holland opened an 
office at a local clinic 
trial evidence would later indicate jones was injecting the 
kerrville victims with succinycholine a paralyzing drug believed by 
many to be untraceable 
but a medical expert in sweden uncovered traces of the drug in 
the body of a tiny victim named chelsea mcclellan and it was her 
death for which jones was tried and convicted of murder in 1984 
despite a 99year prison sentence and a subsequent 60 years 
assessed in an injurytoachild case she will be eligible under 
texas law for parole in 1990 
in this tragedy of few heroes many share blame with genene 
jones elkind concludes among them is kathy holland who has 
never acknowledged that her failure transcended poor judgment and 
naivete 
but responsibility also rests with the doctors and 
administrators in san antonio who had known so much about the 
troubled nurse before the clinic in kerrville even opened they were 
the ones who had evidence she was harming children they were the 
ones who tolerated her blackmail they were the ones who refused to 
fire her for fear of litigation and scandal those people should 
have known better 
unlike genene ann jones they lacked the excuse of madness

501 blues epic merle haggard 
 
country great merle haggard is batting 500 on 501 blues an 
album that succeeds with its more traditional material but falters 
when the singer stretches out stylistically and ventures near 
crossover land 
when the album works haggard remains as vital as the younger 
generation of country stars for whom he has been a major influence 
the best songs are all on the first side of the album which 
opens with the rolling barroom piano of broken friend a lament 
about a relationship that falls apart when two friends become lovers 
one could be forgiven for groaning at the title of losin in 
las vegas who needs another song about hitting the skids in 
vegas right but this is a gem with a worldweary haggard singing 
over a mournful guitar about a failed attempt to settle down 
and make a home in glittertown 
the song 501 blues differs from the usual workingmans tale 
the guy in this song watches the clock but he dreads quitting time 
because hes got no one to go home to 
haggards rich voice and excellent backup musicians also shine on 
the ballad someday well know and the midtempo wouldnt that 
be something 
the album takes a turn for the worse on the second side an 
aimless collection of songs redeemed by the bluesy a thousand lies 
ago haggard can do better than the lightweight boogie of if you 
want to be my woman and sea of heartbreak an odd attempt to 
incorporate a pseudoreggae beat into his bag of tricks 
also with only about half an albums worth of good material it 
seems appropriate to note the records entire length is barely more 
than 30 minutes

diamond mine atlantic blue rodeo 
 
knocking one band to praise another is usually a cheap way to do 
business but sometimes the comparisons are too good to resist 
the virtually unknown band blue rodeo has perfected the languid 
countryrock sound sought by ballyhooed canadian cousins cowboy 
junkies but unlike the junkies blue rodeos work is neither 
affected nor boring 
diamond mine is just as its title suggests a record where 
treasures are regularly unearthed 
with nearly every song theres the nagging sense that youve 
heard it somewhere before but cant quite place it and while there 
are hints of bruce springsteen the band jackson browne johnnie 
cash and dozens of others in the music its not strictly derivative 
common themes are dealt with succinctly and without cliche the 
torontobased band quickly undresses oliver north on god and 
country you call this justice sing jim cuddy and greg 
keelor i call this selfservice 
while love and understanding tackles the problems of war and 
drug abuse with a hopelessly 60s approach love and 
understanding are the best answers ive heard yet it somehow 
doesnt sound naive 
blue rodeo mixes country twang and rock drive adroitly with 
cuddys relatively sweet voice offering a good counterpoint to 
keelors sinister growl the instrumentation is firstrate with 
inspired drumming by cleave anderson on love and understanding 
and duty on the piano accordion and organ by bob wiseman 
they mix brief instrumental interludes with titles such as 
swells and percussive piano on the hourlong disc the 
approach gives a relaxed pace that accentuates the finer songs 
the one miscalculation here is a whopper the title cuts killer 
hook rightfully makes it the centerpiece of the record but a 
meandering solo passage stretches the song to a grueling 818 throw 
out the doors records from this groups collection 
even this mistake gives notice this is a band with a strong and 
stubborn view of itself throughout diamond mine this 
selfconfidence consistently rewards listeners

for cheech marin the 1960s was an awakening 
it was like i came out of my shell and i found other people 
were thinking like thoughts he said i became aware of my own 
power to change events and people around me no matter what a small 
degree i found the power of uniting with other people and effecting 
change 
marin and his partner tommy chong became symbols of those 
turbulent years the poets laureate of pot culture their first 
album cheech and chong went gold the second big bambu 
was voted top comedy album of 1972 the third los cochinos won 
the grammy much of the comedy was centered on getting stoned 
the theme continued with their first movie up in smoke 
which was the topgrossing comedy of 1978 cheech and chong made 
five more films and cameo appearances in yellowbeard and after 
hours before splitting as a team four years ago 
marin is exploring the 60s once more in the orion release 
rude awakening costarring with eric roberts julie hagerty and 
robert carradine roberts and marin play a couple of hippies who 
return from 20 years of selfexile to find their former comrades 
transformed into moneymad yuppies 
recalling his own transformation in the 60s marin reflected 
i was kind of a straight college guy belonged to a fraternity and 
went to school every day my dad was a cop and i was straight down 
the center then change picture 
i discovered pottery and pot and friends and ideas and other 
bohemians and topanga canyon a hippie hangout so it was goodbye 
see you later this was another life i left the country and went 
to canada for three years and i met chong and came back and did 
cheech and chong 
i really feel sorry for kids who didnt experience the 60s 
it was a great awakening a great time of unity when everybody was 
thinking the same thought 
although the cheech and chong years made him rich marin 
denies he has embraced the establishment like his old buddies in 
rude awakening 
i always consider myself an outsider as much as im a part of 
hollywood he said i dont really hang out in hollywood too 
much i dont go to parties or hobnob with producers i live way out 
at the end of malibu almost to oxnard 
some of his old compatriots have turned yuppie he observed but 
others have remained dyedinthewool 
liveinthewoodsinatepeewithnoelectricity hippies who have 
the same ideals 
the people i hang out with more or less cling to those ideals 
the same as i do he said 
he admitted that todays younger generation does not have the 
unifying factor of the vietnam war it was a real and present 
danger that you were going to get drafted and shipped over there 
saving the amazon rain forest is not quite the same but marin is 
pleased that young americans are beginning to embrace such issues 
after the friendly breakup with chong marin sought new avenues 
of endeavor he wrote directed and starred in born in east 
la which was a modest success last year 
marin who actually was born in central los angeles and grew up 
in the san fernando valley is writing a new script angel of 
oxnard which he plans to shoot in the spring its all about his 
present home grounds which he calls a small town that might be in 
kansas an agricultural community caught in the midst of change 
as one time prophets of the drug generation cheech and chong 
might seem antithetical in todays just say no atmosphere but 
marin has no regrets 
not a bit absolutely not i loved what we were doing i loved 
the cheech and chong movies and the albums they will probably 
outlast anything ive ever done theyre rented all the time in 
video the albums still sell today weve become part of peoples 
vocabulary kids today see the movies and buy the albums they make 
people laugh and thats what counts 
the just say no campaign comes out of where the scene had 
gone he said theres a real whole world of difference between 
a bunch of hippies sitting around the fire smoking a joint and 
trying to find god and 14yearold uzitoting beepercarrying 
crack dealers they have nothing to do with our generation and are 
totally devoid of the message we were saying 
drugs have definitely gotten out of hand and i agree with the 
just say no campaign there is a great distinction between what 
people do and what people did

george segal whose lifesize sculptures 
turned him into a pop art icon in the 1960s is molding his plaster 
into other shapes 
the 64yearold american artist is adding color and religious 
themes to his work and is even trying theater designs 
in his first major european show of the decade at a seafront 
casino in this beach resort segal has included his trademark 
plasters but this time in either rusty or vivid tones to add 
contrast a series of pastel paintings is also on show revealing a 
new side the artist perfected in the 1980s 
biblical themes such as the expulsion and abrahams farewell to 
ishmael are on show alongside his ghostly plasters which seem to 
sleepwalk through modern society 
the softspoken sculptor avoid questions about these changes 
you have to follow your own logic he said in an interview in 
the garden of the knokke casino owners 
segal made a stopover here to open his show following a 
threeweek stay in moscow where he designed his first theater set 
for director maximilian schell 
he said he never felt trapped by the plaster sculptures that shot 
him to fame with such pop artists as andy warhol claes oldenburg 
jasper johns and roy lichtenstein 
when pop art first became noticed i felt i was sitting on the 
tail of a rocket said segal amazingly it still flies 
and it is still spanning the globe 
he said interest in japan had increased in the 1980s to the 
extent that he had to reduce his presence in europe where he made 
his first international breakthrough at the parisian gallery of 
ileana sonnabend in 1963 in the 70s the west germany contemporary 
art museums stocked their showrooms with his plasters 
now he is back on the continent even making a rare detour to the 
soviet union schell lured him into a moscow theater to create the 
decor for faith love hope a 1936 play by austrian odon von 
horvath because the stage director thought the dark gray grim 
mood of the sculptures was similar to the mood of the play segal 
said 
returning to the soviet union for the first time in 15 years 
brought equally bleak visions of soviet society to life for segal 
despite the spirit of glasnost it is just as grim there is less 
food and more cars 
his return there also proves his appeal has remained 
undiminished i never expected to be so popular over such a large 
part of the world he said 
segal still uses his chicken farm in new jersey as a studio and 
he continues to work at a steady pace not pressured by increasing 
demands and prizes 
i just refused to accelerate production he said explaining 
that it could have changed his art 
segal was first a painter pursuing the impressionistic style of 
matisse before a nagging insecurity pushed him toward experimenting 
with plaster and wire in the late 50s he soon started making molds 
of models and placed them in real settings 
his work was lauded by other pop art greats 
we all knew each other we went in and out of each others 
studio we all shared basic ideas he said we were in reaction 
against pure abstraction and wanted to reintroduce the real world 
instead of abstract expressionist drippings of jackson pollock 
pop art produced such pieces of reality as warhols campbells 
soup cans lichtensteins blownup cartoons and segals sculptures 
segal has gone on from there and his pieces now increasingly 
resemble the academic works of 19thcentury sculptors such as rodin 
another master in creating theatrical composition 
segals method however is anything but traditional 
he puts pieces of cloth dipped in plaster on a live model and 
waits until they harden on the body the uneasiness of the situation 
brings out the real emotions in the models he said and gives his 
work much of its authenticity 
its very hard to be a fake with that kind of wet discomfort 
over such a long period of time 
they suffer for my art he said with a grin

in 1956 a 72yearold retired teacher pondered 
the idea of forming an organization to help older people get health 
insurance 
two years later ethel percy andrus and two compatriots met at 
washingtons woodner hotel and voted to incorporate the american 
association of retired persons by then envisioned as more than a 
mere source of insurance 
what evolved was a nonprofit organization that has grown in 31 
years to 306 million members surpassed in size in the united 
states only by the catholic church 
its activities include a mailorder pharmacy service educational 
publications and classes a senior volunteer network local chapter 
activities circulationleading modern maturity magazine driver 
education courses legal assistance a discount purchase program 
group health home and auto insurance a motor club travel service 
investment programs and even help filling out tax forms 
and topping the list is aarps role as the voice of the elderly 
in washington and at statehouses around the nation 
aarp is not just the most important force in the gray lobby 
it is unquestionably the nations largest and most powerful interest 
group authors peter g peterson and neil howe wrote in the book 
on borrowed time 
aarp executive director horace deets said the organizations 
influence he shuns the word clout as suggesting power gained 
by threat stems from the reasonableness of our positions and the 
thoroughness of our research 
but he acknowledges having 30 million members certainly gets 
someones attention that will open a door for me to talk to a 
congressman or a senator or a governor 
aarp has no political action committee to funnel money to 
candidates and it refuses to take sides in partisan politics 
preferring to explain the issues to its members who are among the 
most politically active citizens in the electorate and let them 
vote and write letters accordingly deets said 
political analyst william schneider of the american enterprise 
institute said another reason aarp and the senior lobby overall 
is so powerful is that most americans dont see older people as just 
another special interest group 
the elderly are not seen as a special interest because everyone 
expects to get old schneider said its impossible to get 
people of working age to oppose benefits for people of retirement 
age 
that attitude may have been altered somewhat at least on capitol 
hill in reaction to a firestorm of protest from older americans 
angry at their costs for new medicare coverage of catastrophic 
illnesses 
theres real resentment in the congress about how senior 
citizens have responded said bruce fried of the national health 
care campaign im afraid that will have a fairly negative 
impact on efforts to further expand benefits 
aarp itself caught heat from senior citizens over the 
catastrophic program because it was a key player in the legislative 
negotiations and reluctantly acceded to financing it partly through 
an income tax surcharge on some elderly beneficiaries 
deets said aarp tried unsuccessfully to change the financing of 
the program and eventually backed the legislation as on balance 
deserving of support 
he said aarp has gotten more than 60000 letters about the 
catastrophic program most of them complaints but he insists the 
controversy hasnt weakened the organization 
i think it probably makes you vibrant he said sometimes 
disagreement can bring light and breathe life 
fernando torresgil associate professor of gerontology and 
public administration at the university of southern california said 
aarp may have alienated some of its affluent members by backing the 
catastrophic bill but it mitigated one of the criticisms that 
theyve always faced that they represent the articulate and 
welloff elderly 
in the long run they will be much stronger he predicted 
while aarps influence on capitol hill is well known some 
observers say the massive size of the organization and its diverse 
membership may limit its effectiveness 
its just too big its unwieldly said harry r moody of 
the brookdale center on aging at hunter college in new york the 
aging lobby has a lot of differences within itself the image of the 
gray lobby as an allpowerful force is a vast exaggeration 
torresgil said that while the perception of senior citizens 
clout has increased dramatically over the years the reality is 
that their political influence is becoming fragmented 
deets acknowledged that with aarps diverse membership to 
speak with one voice becomes difficult but he said there still is 
broad consensus on many issues such age discrimination income 
security and longterm care 
howe a senior fellow at the retirement policy institute said 
that because aarps ranks include members ranging down to age 50 it 
is experiencing an identity crisis that eventually will spread 
throughout the senior lobby 
its going to happen to all of the elderly lobbies but its 
happening to aarp first he said its getting a new generation 
of elderly a very different generation of elderly

suburban detroit was no place to retire so virginia and tom 
powers packed up their belongings and moved 
they didnt go to the sun belt 
the powers retired north to michigans upper peninsula a 
flannelshirted place even on july nights famous for arduous 
winters and mosquitobit summers 
land of the loon the tshirts say 
the powers could have flocked south like so much of americas 
retiring public but it was in these snowbirds minds to head 
instead toward canada 
i think florida is pretty crowded and in my opinion there are 
not enough young people there she said all you do in florida 
is get behind some large car going 10 miles an hour 
older americans are a moving lot the us bureau of the census 
calculates that last year 53 percent of those over 65 changed 
homes one out of five of them settling in another state 
from 1975 to 1980 more than 9 percent of those over 60 moved out 
of their home cities while another 134 percent moved within their 
towns said dr charles longino a university of miami researcher 
who spent six years studying the migration 
warmer dryer weather and lifestyle amenities like yearround 
golf continue to draw most retirees south and west said don fowles 
a statistician for the us administration on aging in washington 
dc people are more sensitive to cold as they grow older 
a minority of the affluent elderly seek colder climates as did 
the powers virginia 67 and tom 68 found their haven on the tip 
of the garden peninsula a remote spit of land on the north shore of 
lake michigan 
there is only one paved road down the peninsula the largest 
town garden has just a single grocery store and two bars most of 
the residents are farmers loggers or fishermen 
after living in an area as congested as detroit you need the 
space the north provides virginia said i think most retirees 
find it so blissful up here with the clean air and the space 
theres no fear and its such a relaxed feeling she said 
theres a friendlier attitude up here 
there also are economic reasons for flying north 
the bottom dropped out of the upper peninsulas economy five 
years ago homes entered the market at rock bottom prices as iron 
ore mines closed and workers moved away to find jobs 
the economy has picked up since then but housing remains a 
bargain a decent threebedroom home in the upper peninsula goes for 
30000 and 100000 will buy you a dream house on the shore said 
escanaba real estate agent jeanne bonefeld her son in florida tells 
her the same homes sell for two to three times as much among the 
orange groves 
the ruggedness has its definite disadvantages tom broke his leg 
recently when he was hit by a falling cedar tree the closest 
hospital was more than an hour away although the local ambulance 
arrived within 15 minutes 
and when tom needed arterial bypass surgery two years ago the 
powers elected to use a hospital in green bay wis 
retirees living in the north woods may find themselves isolated 
financially and geographically from health care 
a hearing in houghton lake held by michigans office of services 
to the aging in june turned up tales of 20mile ambulance rides to 
the nearest hospital costing from 400 to 1000 each we need to 
determine if theyre paying actual costs or if theyre being 
bilked said mary lindemann with the state agency in lansing 
and then there is the snow 
delta county gets an average 56 inches of snowfall a winter 
more on the garden peninsula since it is surrounded by water so 
the powers own a snowblower and clear their 1100foot driveway 
themselves 
their road is too narrow for a commercial plow the powers could 
widen it but that would ruin the remote atmosphere virginia says 
it takes the kind of person who likes the isolation we enjoy 
having the elbow room we had lived cheek by jowl in town and we 
were looking for someplace else she said 
the powers have found a definite change of pace since their 
working days he as a school administrator and she as a high school 
english teacher outside of detroit 
chickadees eat out of our hands i identified 42 different 
kinds of wild flowers in my yard i press flowers and make bookmarks 
and make pine cone wreaths and i knit chair cushions and send them 
off to my friends you have time virginia said 
we never realized how beautiful a sunset was and we never 
realized how far north the sun moves in the summer how far south in 
the winter

for more than a decade paul isaacson has 
labored to save the souls of his dead ancestors patiently searching 
miles of microfilm and stacks of catalogs in the mormon churchs 
family history library 
mormon missionary work isnt limited to the living and each day 
thousands of the faithful flock to the library the worlds largest 
repository of genealogical records to fulfill the churchs 
determination to baptize every person who ever lived 
theres something spiritual to it said isaacson a mormon 
who often devotes his days off and evenings to genealogical 
research also its your roots your family its kind of like a 
mystery trying to track someone down its a puzzle to be solved 
but as the popularity of tracing ones roots has become more 
popular the family history library of the church of jesus christ of 
latterday saints has become a prime resource for nonmormon 
professional and amateur genealogists 
of the 3000 people who use the library each day about 40 
percent are nonmormon said tom daniels the librarys director of 
information often they come by the busload in tours organized by 
genealogical societies from throughout the united states and europe 
the most recent survey of users conducted in the winter of 1988 
indicated that senior citizens made up about 40 percent of the 
librarys users a figure consistent with other surveys of recent 
years daniels said 
seniors also make up the majority of some 250 church volunteers 
who supplement the librarys 200 fulltime staff members daniels 
said the seniors are called or asked by the church to work at 
the library for a limited period of time 
use of the library is free and those who come have access to 
birth and death records of an estimated 15 billion to 2 billion 
people culled from the archives of about 100 nations 
business is sufficiently brisk that the churchs genealogical 
department which operates the library has outgrown a threestory 
building constructed five years ago across the street from the salt 
lake temple in downtown salt lake city 
several of the departments divisions are housed in an office 
building a block away and the library will expand to occupy a 
portion of the old hotel utah which is being renovated to house a 
chapel and administrative offices 
daniels said library usage has increased 60 percent since 1984 
the greatest period of growth since the early 1970s when alex 
haleys book roots turned thousands of people to genealogy as a 
hobby 
daniels said he cannot explain the latest surge in genealogical 
activity the church always has encouraged its members to research 
their ancestry and submit names of their forebears to temples where 
such ordinances as baptism are performed by living proxies 
but in recent years more people have been taking advantage of the 
archives and that may have induced more church members to get 
involved 
why the large number of nonmormons are coming i dont know 
maybe its just a natural increase in hobbyists he said 
mormons believe that spirits of dead persons should have the 
opportunity to accept mormonism in afterlife members are encouraged 
to have the faiths ordinances performed for all their ancestors in 
the hope that they will embrace the faith 
the doctrinal injunction for genealogical work is strong the 
churchs founder joseph smith told his followers more than 100 
years ago that the greatest responsibility in this world that god 
has lain upon us is to seek after our dead 
the church has taken smiths charge seriously about 200 
photographers regularly are dispatched overseas to photograph 
records of birth death and census records in any country that will 
permit it 
records have been copied extensively in europe more recently the 
collection effort has shifted to latin america and asia 
for eight years church photographers have been copying chinese 
records including some lines that reach back more than 1000 years 
theyre far superior far more accurate than european 
records daniels said in oriental records 65 generations of 
continuous recordkeeping are not uncommon in europe youre lucky 
to find 10 
to ensure nothing is lost master copies of the microfilm are 
kept in the churchs granite mountain records vault carved deep 
into a mountainside about 20 miles southeast of salt lake city 
designed to withstand a nuclear explosion the vault features an 
archivequality air filtering system a complete microfilm 
processing laboratory and six storage rooms each measuring 200 feet 
long and 25 feet high 
ready to process records as they arrive from overseas is a 
library staff that collectively is fluent in nearly every major 
language on the library floor staff linguists are available to 
assist patrons 
theres nothing comparable to the library in terms of its 
comprehensive nature said jay hall director of global research 
a salt lake citybased professional genealogical service affiliated 
with everton publishing which produces a directory of genealogical 
sources called the genealogical helper 
hall said 98 percent of his business is with nonmormons living 
outside of utah likewise most of the genealogical helpers 50000 
subscribers are not mormon and do not live in utah 
theres a vast amount of interest hall said a lot of 
people think its totally fascinating to learn about their 
ancestors it gives them a feeling of heritage for the 
professional the most important thing is to have the detective 
feeling 
its kind of like the thrill of the hunt

a twogeneration gap is being wiped away in travel these days 
grandparents are often traveling with grandchildren and tour 
operators are designing trips especially geared for grandparents 
or greataunts and uncles or surrogate grandparents traveling 
with youngsters two generations down the line 
helene koenig founder and owner of the ticket counter a travel 
agency in chevy chase md says she decided to create grandtravel 
when she herself learned a few years ago that she was going to be a 
grandmother grandtravels offerings range from the washington area 
to american indian country in the southwest the alaskan wilderness 
dutch waterways and canals new zealand and hawaii 
the youngsters usually range in ages from 7 to 14 the oldest 
grandparent so far has been an unmarried gentleman of 79 who 
mrs koenig says just wanted to see how the idea worked 
mrs koenig matches her itineraries to the energy and interests 
of both generations so its not surprising that the tower of london 
and madame tussauds waxworks are part of a british tour or that 
children may enjoy water sports weather permitting while their 
grandparents visit the aalsmeer flower auction in the netherlands 
but the favorite trip of young and old alike mrs koenig says 
is definitely the african safari you never outgrow your love for 
a lion she said in a telephone interview 
el al the israeli airline and aarp the american association of 
retired persons also are in the act 
el al aims to give the older generation an opportunity to 
acquaint the youngsters with their jewish heritage in israel and 
again keeping in mind the needs of old and young the itinerary 
includes a biblical zoo of species of animals that were living in 
biblical times the stalagmite caves southwest of jerusalem and a 
chance for the kids to float in the highly saline dead sea as well 
as more obvious attractions 
alice gregory marketing manager for the aarps travel service 
says its program started only last year with one devoted to an 
american heritage area including washington dc and another to a 
european destination it is now planning to include tours covering 
national parks london rome and amsterdam and perhaps other 
destinations 
an agent for saga international a bostonbased branch of a 
british company of the same name that specializes in travel for 
seniors says it has been conducting grandchildrengrandparent 
travel ever since it began business in the united states in 1982 
the children may not be over 16 the grandparents must be at least 
60 
in all cases most of the tours are in summer when children are 
out of school 
mrs koenig sees todays grandparents as already sophisticated 
travelers and in really good shape aerobically fit and 
nutritionally sound and often more relaxed financially than the 
grandchilds own parents often grandparents and grandchildren live

youngsters because they meet others of their age group 
mrs edwards took 11yearold elizabeth edwards on the national

cannot drive great distances she also says that although she sees 
her grandchildren about twice a week at home in jackson she saw a 
whole new facet of elizabeth on the trip and in the oneonone

youre never too old to get into the game 
proof comes from the games gang a young company started by older 
entrepreneurs which hit the jackpot so to speak with pictionary 
currently the bestselling board game in the business 
the games gang was founded in 1986 by a group of toy industry 
veterans who found themselves out of work when their previous 
employer selchow and righter the trivial pursuit company was 
bought out by coleco the cabbage patch doll company 
rather than retire they decided to pool their knowhow with joe 
cornacchia 57 an old friend who had been one of s and rs 
contractors to put together a new enterprise along with tom 
mcguire an s and r veteran who had left the company earlier the 
founding group included hudson dobson 68 angelo longo 61 tom 
mcgrath 60 frank martin 57 kevin mcnulty 38 mike gasser 35 
and bill napier who has since died cornacchia is president of the 
young company and mcguire is vice president of sales and marketing 
when cornacchia contacted mcguire he found he had been 
independently representing rob angel the inventor of pictionary a 
board game that had done well in the northwest market the games 
gang signed an agreement and made pictionary its first product 
with seed money of about 250000 they began marketing the new 
game nationally within six months they had 300000 orders by 1988 
sales exceeded 125 million making the games gang one of the top 
board games companies around 
with something like 13 million copies of pictionary sold the 
group is now developing offshoots and other new games one of the 
newest entries is called gender bender a role reversal game that 
was developed by chris haney coinventor of trivial pursuit 
one of the ironies of this selfdescribed over the hill gang 
is that they say theyve made their biggest impact in the youth 
market

you have property you want to continue living on but you also 
want to settle the question of who you give it to when you die 
preferably maximizing its value and minimizing taxes 
or possibly you need greater current income and look to your 
assets as a source but you find that the capital gains penalty will 
prevent their profitable sale 
what to do 
charitable trusts and gift annuities made to institutions like 
schools are one legal way to have your cake and eat it too 
alf and betty thompson still live on their lakefront property in 
illinois even though they have deeded it to millikin university in 
decatur 
we spent 25 years building up our land and didnt want to just 
let it go says alf thompson while we did get a gift tax 
deduction the more important benefit for us was helping millikin 
carry on our development here 
the thompsons have planted hundreds of trees shrubs and flowers 
on the property which has grown from 125 to nearly 20 acres since 
they deeded it to the school with their blessing millikin already 
is using it for meetings and the land will be turned into a retreat 
for the school when the thompsons die or give up life tenancy 
if elsie welter had sold her 25 acres of land and an apartment 
house in minnesota worth 500000 she would have failed to realize 
a profit because of the capital gains penalty so instead she 
established a charitable gift annuity by donating the property to 
her alma mater concordia college in moorehead minn that way she 
supported one of her favorite causes education and at the same 
time got a large tax deduction and continues to receive guaranteed 
annuity checks from the school 
if elsie had sold her real estate outright the capital gains 
tax would have been tremendous says john pierce director of 
planned giving at concordia it would have cut her earning power 
incredibly the annuity gives her the cash flow to continue living 
life the way she wants to 
people who want their assets to go to colleges can use charitable 
trusts and gift annuities to donate money property or appreciated 
securities while continuing to receive income from those assets 
during their lifetimes most universities have planned giving 
offices to advise and help them manage donations so they can take 
advantage of tax incentives and savings 
there are different options to fit each donors needs says 
bob nourse associate director of planned giving at lafayette 
college in easton pa we work closely with each individual to 
find the right one 
most schools offer a pooled income fund in which a number of 
individual donations are combined and invested cooperatively 
another possibility is a deferred payment gift annuity which 
lets younger investors donate now and receive annual income payments 
after retirement 
charitable gift annuities like elsie welters are irrevocable 
the university owns the principal while guaranteeing an income for 
life based on a fixed percentage rate others like the revocable 
charitable remainder trust lets donors control principal and add 
withdraw or transfer funds at any time even opening a bank account 
in trust for the university revocable trusts dont provide current 
income tax benefits but they do provide estate tax benefits after 
death 
trusts and annuities allow an enormous amount of flexibility 
says mark elliott director of planned giving at bucknell university 
in lewisburg pa they can offer guaranteed payments high income 
growth or some combination of all three

more people might use living wills to avoid futile 
medical treatment if the documents set down specific guidelines for 
care rather than rejecting vague heroic measures to maintain 
life two doctors say 
only 9 percent of americans have living wills although the wills 
are recognized legally in more than 75 percent of the states the 
doctors noted recently in the journal of the american medical 
association 
people can use living wills to instruct doctors and families that 
they do not want to be kept alive indefinitely by mechanical means 
such as respirators if they become ill or injured with no hope of 
recovery 
samples of living wills are apparently not reaching physicians 
offices or hospitals write the doctors linda l emanuel of 
massachusetts general hospital and ezekiel j emanuel of beth israel 
hospital in boston 
they recommend a document that outlines righttodie dilemmas and 
appropriate treatments 
the doctors say that living wills tend to be written in vague 
terms such as instructions to stop care when there is no 
reasonable expectation of recovery or when such care 
constitutes heroic measures 
such phrases are open to multiple interpretations on when to 
act and on what interventions the patient would desire say the 
doctors 
people who sign living wills often do so without discussion with 
their doctors leaving them ignorant of their wishes the authors 
say 
many choose to give all decisionmaking authority to a relative 
but the doctors cite surveys that show the relative often does not 
know what type of care the patient would want 
in the article the doctors propose a document that would clarify 
what treatments the patient thinks acceptable in four situations 
a coma with no known hope of regaining awareness 
a coma with a small likelihood of recovering fully a 
slightly larger likelihood of recovering with brain damage and 
a much larger likelihood of dying 
irreversible brain damage or disease accompanied by a terminal 
illness 
irreversible brain damage or disease that makes speaking or 
recognizing people impossible but is not accompanied by terminal 
illness 
for each category the document would list 12 possible 
treatments including cardiopulmonary resuscitation mechanical 
breathing artificial feeding surgery drugs and simple diagnostic 
tests 
the form would not eliminate all medical or legal uncertainty 
but it would provide a tangible expression of the patients 
wishes the doctors say

as you age you need to exercise as much as ever say health 
experts regular exercise can help you maintain flexibility and 
endurance 
at the same time you should be wary of of potential injury 
according to dr gil allen vice president of the new york state 
chiropractic association he offers these tips to maximize the 
benefits of exercise and minimize the possibility of getting hurt 
check with your doctor before starting any exercise program 
especially if youve been inactive for a while 
choose an exercise that you can do and will enjoy 
take it slow and steady remember your body isnt 20 years old 
any more so allow time for your muscles to adapt to the added work 
youre giving them first try working out on alternate days then 
gradually increase intensity and duration 
consider your body type when choosing an exercise people with 
slender angular frames usually dont have sufficient muscle mass 
for highstrength exercises but do well in endurance activities such 
as longdistance running or crosscountry skiing overweight people 
should be wary of putting too much pressure on joints or risk stress 
injuries by running theyre better off with moderate aerobic 
activities like biking swimming and walking 
warm up and cool down exercise slowly at first to limber up 
and get blood flowing into muscles and joints this will increase 
muscle elasticity and help prevent injury cool down for five 
minutes by stretching stretches should be slow and not painful 
pain signals injury so pay attention to it be alert for pain 
in bones joints or muscles spasms or swelling joint stiffness 
restricted motion or numbness or tingling in a hand or foot use 
the rice resticecompressionelevation treatment as first aid 
and continue until pain and swelling are gone sprains are serious 
and require immobilization of the injured part

fewer people now lose their teeth as they age thanks to greater 
knowledge about dental hygiene fluoridation and more sophisticated 
skills used by dentists 
you can increase your chances of saving your teeth with proper 
care and awareness of the types of problems that can develop as you 
age according to pamela parker brangan associate professor of 
dental hygiene at old dominion university in norfolk va she offers 
these tips 
fight tooth decay which most often occurs in the root at the 
gum line by limiting sweets and brushing near the gum line with a 
soft brush ms brangan points out that the roots are not covered by 
enamel and are especially vulnerable to rapid decay she notes that 
hard toothbrushes are not only ineffective at cleaning at the gum 
line but can abrade the root surface sensitizing teeth to hot and 
cold 
be alert to signs of gingivitis such as red swollen and tender 
gums that may bleed when brushed or flossed this form of 
periodontal disease which develops slowly and progressively causes 
more tooth loss in people over 40 than any other problem says ms 
brangan gingivitis can be prevented or reversed with daily care 
along with consultation with a dentist or dental hygienist they can 
recommend a proper cleaning routine and determine if hard deposits 
need to be removed or fillings refilled the advanced form of this 
disease is called periodontitis and is characterized by loose teeth 
receded gums bad breath or bad taste in the mouth and pus between 
gums and teeth left untreated periodontitis usually ends in tooth 
loss 
offset dry mouth by trying a saliva substitute or consulting 
with your doctor about changing medications which can contribute to 
the problem saliva production decreases with age and because it 
helps protect teeth from plaque this can contribute to decay as 
well as cause discomfort denture wearers also are likely to 
experience discomfort because saliva is normally needed to form a 
seal between dentures and soft gum tissues 
dont overcompensate for the natural decline of taste buds by 
adding extra salt and sugar to foods 
take care of your dentures daily hygiene continues to be 
important since plaque and calculus form on dentures as they do on 
natural teeth causing irritation to the gum tissue and often 
leading to oral lesions under dentures dentures should be rinsed 
after meals and brushed once a day ms brangan recommends using a 
nonabrasive cleaner and a toothbrush cleaning the outer surfaces 
with the flat portion of the brush and inner surfaces with the tip 
the tip also works well for cleaning clasps of partial dentures she 
says finish by thoroughly rinsing 
avoid longterm or severe sun exposure or excessive use of 
tobacco or alcohol since all contribute to possible cancers

the older person who has trouble remembering 
simple things like the route to a friends house or a store in his 
neighborhood can use basic navigation principles to overcome the 
problem say researchers at the catholic university of america 
consciously using landmark identification the same way as ships 
or hikers can help the older person keep track of the way according 
to paula darby lipman of rockville md a recent phd graduate 
ms lipman and james e youniss cua professor organized a study to 
determine how people of various ages remembered routes as part of 
their research on agerelated memory function they walked 
members of their study groups through slides representing trips 
through neighborhoods 
older persons tended to make a lot more personal associations 
with the routes younger persons looked strictly for ways to 
remember the routes when i interviewed the oldest subjects they 
often mentioned the flowers in the trees the condition of the 
neighborhood or the season says ms lipman 
she says that older people may have wanted to make the 
identifying task more meaningful or personal to offset the burden of 
coping with all the information presented but her study confirmed 
that those who concentrated on landmarks at turns were best able to 
recreate the routes from unordered slides 
theres so much information you can get from any route its 
just that some of it is more important picking out the information 
that will help in remembering turns is easier than trying to 
remember all the landmarks in sequential order she says 
the study supports a widely held theory about aging and memory 
that for many people shortterm memory decreases with age though 
some seem to use the landmark strategy naturally others can learn 
the technique with a conscious effort ms lipman says

that comforting amenity of memory the 
doctors house call still exists 
dr james mold for one still makes house calls to elderly 
patients and says he finds them useful and in fact enjoyable 
there are a variety of reasons physicians still make them 
says mold assistant professor of family medicine and director of 
the geriatrics program at the university of oklahoma health sciences 
center one reason i make house calls is that they allow me to get 
to know patients in a way i cant during a regular office call 
mold says that the home setting often alerts him to problems like 
overuse of medication or alcohol abuse things he might miss during 
an office appointment 
with geriatric patients how they function is often much more 
important than diagnosing disease he says the place where 
people function is in their home so its crucial in some cases that 
you actually see what the person is dealing with 
mold says the home setting is more relaxing and reassuring to the 
patient and he often can get a more accurate blood pressure reading 
but the negative side has to be considered too he says the 
doctor cant rely on staff and equipment backup that he has at his 
office there also is the cost which isnt covered by fees 
despite these drawbacks he predicts that a doctors will make 
more house calls in the future owing to the greater number of older 
people and to the interest in home health care to shorten hospital 
stays doctors probably will be working closely with home care 
agencies he says 
patients who are too frail to make trips to the office or dont 
have transportation shouldnt hesitate to ask their doctors to come 
to them he adds 
personally i find house calls very enjoyable i feel more 
comfortable and the patients feel more comfortable he says 
people are appreciative when i take the time to come out and 
everyone likes to be appreciated

organizing caregiving in a businesslike way can defuse emotional 
tension when you find yourself responsible for the care of an aging 
parent or relative says joanellen foyder author of the family 
caregivers guide 
foyder of yonkers ny is a former shopping mall management 
executive who cared for her mother through a difficult parkinsons 
disease illness that the responsibility fell on her as the closest 
female relative was typical since the majority of caregivers are 
women regardless of the number of male relatives 
what wasnt typical was her response once i realized it was 
sink or swim i took it on as a business assignment she says she 
organized charts schedules and plotted ways to involve other 
members of the family and even visitors 
these are incorporated in her book which the publishers say is 
the first guide on the subject for nonprofessionals 
she advises the caregiver to avoid the martyr role and to speak 
up for her own needs by giving copies of a care schedule to other 
members of the family they will become aware of just how many hours 
each task takes and the size of the burden shes handling 
she should ask for onsite help from each member of the family or 
money to pay for professional help to give the caregiver respite a 
written family agreement will defuse many feelings of guilt or 
resentment about the responsibilities she says

older adults can cut the strain of housework through organization 
and selection of easytouse appliances 
gary van deursen black and deckers director of industrial 
design and new product concepts says his research shows that 40 
percent of americans 65 or older have problems doing housework and 
operating appliances manufacturers now recognize that older people 
need appliances that are easy to operate and simple to maintain he 
says 
he offers these tips to make the best of them and lighten the 
work 
dont strain your back by dragging around a fullsized vacuum 
cleaner when a lightweight sticktype vacuum will do the same work 
cordless vacuums are another backsaver handheld models are 
more convenient for small messes and quick pickups 
to pick up dust that accumulates underneath beds or sofas 
choose a cleaner that will operate in both upright and horizontal 
positions that way you wont have to move furniture 
when cleaning or dusting start from the top of the room and 
work down a handheld vacuum that has attachments that can reach 
high areas like curtains and ceiling corners and a crevice tool for 
getting into door tracks and under radiators will save handson 
dusting 
look for a handheld model designed to balance its weight under 
the handle instead of in front of it also check if it has a lockon 
or slide switch instead of a button that must be pushed and held 
down while cleaning if you have arthritis youll find the 
appliance easier to grip if you wrap a soft towel or cloth around 
the handle for additional width and comfort 
to deal with pet hair choose a unit that has a motorized power 
brush attachment with both long and short bristles 
clean spills and stains immediately as chances for easy 
removal are 75 percent greater if a stain is fresh spills of wax 
chocolate crayon and bubble gum shoud be allowed to dry until they 
are hard enough to scrape off with a dull knife

a california study indicates that older people 
who take a driver training refresher courses may have fewer traffic 
convictions and serious accidents than do nonparticipants 
the report cautioned that drivers who took part in a voluntary 
program on which the study is based were a highly selfselected 
group who would be expected to have lower subsequent accident 
rates 
nevertheless it said there was suggestive evidence that the 
driver training course helped reduce accident risk 
we feel the results are quite suggestive and promising said 
ray peck director of research for the california department of 
motor vehicles 
drivers over age 65 are second only to those age 15 to 24 in 
traffic accidents and when the number of miles driven is taken into 
account the two groups are almost equal 
results of the california study were released here by the 
nations largest senior citizen organization the american 
association of retired persons 
aarp presidentelect robert maxwell said the study shows 
refresher courses are one way older drivers can remain safe 
drivers longer 
to lose the ability to drive often traps older people in their 
homes because of that we are dedicated to helping older drivers 
remain safe drivers 
the california study compared driving records for 40339 
graduates of the states mature driver improvement program with 
those of 75064 older drivers who did not take the course all were 
age 55 or above 
adjusting the results to factor out differences between the two 
groups the graduates had 16 percent fewer accidents involving death 
or injury and 157 percent fewer traffic convictions 
most of the participants in the california program took the 55 
alive course developed by aarp california drivers over age 55 who 
take an approved refresher course are eligible for reduced auto 
insurance premiums

after her high school graduation in 1918 edith levy stopped 
taking piano lessons 
but when she started a parttime job as a receptionist at 
chicagos sherwood conservatory of music two years ago she got the 
idea to resume piano study nearly 70 years later 
the piano had always been an important part of my life and 
there i was in an environment where people were playing the music 
id always loved most classical music says levy now 87 
having completed a group piano class and begun biweekly private 
lessons her current project is a complex piece by bach 
as my granddaughter puts it ive never been the kind of 
grandmother who just sits at home and knits she says i enjoy 
being active and playing the piano gives me that opportunity 
one of levys fellow students at the conservatory is 67yearold 
weldon hall who began piano study while in his 50s now that hes 
retired hall spends more time than ever practicing the piano 
about 90 minutes each day 
i never could have found that much time to practice while i was 
working he says now i have a real sense of accomplishment 
because ive mastered some very difficult pieces and ive overcome 
my shyness about playing in front of other people 
brenda dillon a dallasbased piano teacher who teaches several 
older adults believes selfconfidence is the most important factor 
determining whether or not they succeed at piano study 
theres a myth that older people have lesser abilities to 
memorize and perform and thats just what it is a myth she 
insists the only handicap i see in older piano students is that 
sometimes they start believing the myth themselves 
dillon reminds her older students that whatever physical 
difficulties they may have technical problems can be found in piano 
students of all ages and with older people often their great 
enthusiasm and selfdiscipline more than makes up for any physical 
challenges they may have 
at the sherwood conservatory piano teacher harry davidson who 
counts hall and levy among a halfdozen students over age 65 
agrees he says 
of course you notice a persons age initially but once 
lessons get going i forget about it i have the same expectations 
and requirements of all my students regardless of age 
at the southeast senior center for independent living in 
englewood nj officials point to a remarkable example of older 
pianists overcoming physical adversity in an ingenious way 
ruth eisenberg 86 and margaret patrick 75 met at a 
poststroke group session at the center both had enjoyed playing 
piano in the past but had to stop eisenberg had been paralyzed on 
the left side and patrick on the right side 
this idea just came to me recalls millie mchugh a director 
at the center i looked at both of them and said youve got a 
right hand and youve got a left hand now let me hear some 
chopin 
through their joint playing of solo piano pieces the two women 
have discovered the true meaning of teamwork 
sometimes because of my arthritis i have to stop playing for a 
while explains eisenberg but margaret just takes over for me 
and improvises a few measures until i regain my composure 
the pair who call themselves ebony and ivory now play 
regularly at the center and have begun lining up some performance 
engagements in other parts of the country

older adults often neglect eye problems because of the lack of 
insurance coverage for preventive eye care says an optometrist 
writing in the journal of the american optometric association 
the availability of private health insurance covering vision 
care is the lowest for the elderly writes dr satya b verma an 
optometrist at the pennsylvania college of optometry in philadelphia 
verma cites figures from the national center for health 
statistics which show that visits to the eye doctor drop 50 percent 
once the average person retires another nchs study shows that 
private health insurance pays for only 42 percent of eyeglasses for 
the elderly while it pays for 102 percent for those between 25 and 
54 years old 
medicare in 1987 began covering the eye health part of an 
optometric examination if prompted by a symptom or complaint yet 
routine preventive examinations are still excluded from coverage 
verma points out 
reimbursement of preventive vision care will help reduce 
blindness he says 
walking may be the best all around exercise for seniors says one 
sports medicine specialist 
we often advise a regimen of lowimpact conditioning such as 
that afforded by walking says dr ann ward of the university of 
massachusetts medical schools department of exercise physiology 
advantages include overall toning and cardiovascular development 
with little risk of injury 
intensive exercise is not a prerequisite to senior fitness 
she says 
a breathing disorder known as sleep apnea can sometimes be the 
reason elderly people need midday naps say researchers at the 
university of pennsylvania school of medicine in philadelphia 
sleep apnea interrupts breathing during nighttime sleep and 
leaves the person tired in the morning dr alan pack associate 
professor in the cardiovascular pulmonary division of the school 
says that as many as one third of people over 65 may have the 
disorder but dont realize it 
apnea causes the pharyngeal muscles to relax and block airway 
passages in the throat says pack this stops breathing from 10 
seconds to a minute and alerts the brain to open the airway the 
brain awakens and prevents the sleeper from entering deep sleep 
or rem 
men overweight people particularly around the neck and people 
with nasal problems or jaw abnormalities are most likely to be 
affected its often the spouse of the patient who notices the 
problem 
a boxlike mask instrument that forces air through the throat can 
be used to treat the disorder surgery to remove excess tissue in 
the back of the throat may be called for 
if youre over 50 walking is likely to be your favorite form of 
exercise a study sponsored by dr scholls found that 39 percent of 
people 50 or older exercise regularly and walking is their leading 
form of workout 
but the study in cooperation with the american podiatric medical 
association found that threequarters of adults polled said they 
experienced sore feet 
taking care of your feet will increase your painfree mileage 
wellcushioned wellfitted shoes and a daily foot grooming routine

more than two dozen states have acted in the last three years to 
improve guardianships but experts complain that courts still dont 
protect the rights of the elderly some laws dont have teeth and 
others are simply ignored 
the real abuse has been in the supervision of the 
guardianships said john regan a professor of health care law at 
hofstra university you can have the best laws in the world but 
if no one is paying attention to the system the laws arent worth a 
damn 
under guardianship old people judged unable to care for 
themselves or their finances are made wards of the court and 
assigned guardians this strips the wards of control over their 
lives including where they can live what medical treatment they 
receive and how their money is spent 
some 500000 elderly americans are believed to be under 
guardianship 
an associated press study of laws and cases in all 50 states 
found old people were being placed under guardianship without legal 
representation often without their knowledge once under the 
supposed protection of the court some were abused and their money 
misspent because no one monitored their welfare 
as a result of a 1987 series of stories based on the study 
congressional hearings efforts of the american bar association and 
a growing advocacy of the elderly at least 24 states have looked 
anew at their guardianship systems 
its an issue that is not going to go away said shelda 
harden a staff associate with the national conference of state 
legislators it is going to be on the front burner as the 
population gets older 
major changes in indiana michigan oregon utah and washington 
state required courts to take greater steps to ensure protection of 
the rights of potential wards including detailed investigations of 
guardianship petitions and representation of wards by attorneys 
the laws also established alternatives to guardianship and 
encouraged guardianships tailored to the individual a step that 
eliminates the wholesale deprivation of a wards rights other 
states have taken this step including west virginia oklahoma new 
mexico and rhode island 
still others revised their laws some of the changes simply 
cleared up questions of law others make it harder to place a person 
under guardianship better define guardians duties and establish 
more oversight on how a guardian uses the wards money states in 
this category include alabama arizona arkansas colorado hawaii 
iowa kansas north carolina 
guardianship laws are pending in illinois new jersey new york 
and pennsylvania legislative study committees were formed in 
georgia mississippi new york rhode island and texas 
additionally three bills are before congress that would 
establish federal standards for guardianship 
all are similar to legislation introduced by the late rep claude 
pepper dfla his bill would require that wards be better notified 
about guardianship proceedings and be represented by attorneys and 
mandates better training for guardians and an annual review of 
guardianship cases by the courts 
states that fail to enforce the standards would face loss of 
federal funds while many oppose the law as federal intrusion into a 
traditional state role there is support from those involved in 
guardianship 
i think there has to be more protection said patrick murphy 
the cook county ill public guardian illinois requires regular 
accountings of wards estates yet only one in four cases is up to 
date 
right now theres really nobody here looking over the shoulder 
of private guardians making sure theyre doing a good job said 
murphy 
legislative action doesnt ensure that the rights of the elderly 
will be protected even under new laws the rhode island legislature 
passed a bill in 1986 to establish limited guardianships limiting 
the guardians powers to specific issues such as medical care or 
financial matters 
but when questioned by the ap neither the director of the state 
department of elderly affairs nor the chairman of a state bar 
probate committee was aware the law had passed one judge said he 
didnt understand it and hadnt used it and a committee established 
last year to study guardianship has yet to meet 
new jersey legislators created a public guardians office in 1986 
to provide services for people without guardians but despite an 
increase in the number of wards to 300 the offices budget has been 
cut this year 
marie muhler new jerseys public guardian complains she has 
three caseworkers for the 300 wards and has had to ask state courts 
to stop assigning her new cases when they gave me the job they 
said tell us what you need and youll get it the first year i 
got 20 percent of what i asked 
its a question of them coming to grips with dealing with the 
problems of the elderly 
even with good laws and administration there remains potential 
for abuse while most states required courts to review annual 
accountings by guardians nearly half the case files examined by the 
ap were missing at least one accounting 
the aba whose house of delegates this year recommended sweeping 
changes along the same lines as state and federal legislation will 
study enforcement of the laws in california maryland and four 
states still to be chosen 
cleaning up legislative problems is only the first step said 
nancy coleman director of the abas commission on legal problems of 
the elderly youve always got implementation problems that are as 
troublesome as the initial limitations with the legislation 
those in the business of guardianship also are taking steps to 
clean up the system the 2yearold national guardianship 
association is working with its 300 members to establish training 
and professional standards nationwide 
the association which meets in october in atlantic city nj 
also plans to discuss the possibility of certifying guardians 
many of us want to police our own to make sure that gurdianship 
doesnt get a bad name said susan mcmahon association president 
there is no question there have been problems with guardianship 
and there is a need to make it a respectable profession

in a state with one of the highest 
percentages of elderly people a 3yearold change in guardianship 
laws to protect the rights of prospective wards of the court has 
rarely been used 
meanwhile the head of the state department of elderly affairs 
was unaware that the legislature had made the 1986 change to allow 
judges in the states 39 probate courts to limit the powers of 
courtappointed guardians and at least one judge said he didnt 
understand it and hadnt used it 
what it means nobody knows yet said north providence 
probate judge domenic tudino until we get some case law from the 
supreme court he said interpretation of the measure would remain 
vague 
the intent was to provide the ward with as much latitude to 
lead a normal life as possible said the sponsor former rep 
gilbert v indeglia the law allows judges to limit guardianship to 
just part of a wards life such as financial matters or medical 
care 
according to the affidavits of the medical people the wards 
are really totally gone said scituate probate judge theodore a 
miller its not a question of whether they can handle 
themselves 
despite the infrequent use of the limited guardianship provision 
other changes in 1986 improved the situation miller said at one 
time just about anybody could go in and file a guardianship 
petition and nobody else would have to be notified now the 
persons immediate heirs must be contacted 
the law was also changed to require the court to appoint a 
guardian ad litem or friend of the court to interview those in a 
medical facility although no such requirement exists for those 
living elsewhere 
the determination of incompetency rests soley with a doctor who 
is not required to be in court for questioning unless the case is 
contested the ward also does not have to appear before the judge 
or to have legal representation 
department of elderly affairs director adelaide luber who 
acknowledged recently that she was unaware of the changes said 
nonetheless that it is easy to label an elderly person incoherent 
if youre the person whose bill isnt paid you say that person 
doesnt function she said 
david reidel chairman of the state bars probate committee was 
unaware of the changes in the law so was elderly affairs department 
protective services monitor mary ann ciano a member of a committee 
established last year by the legislature to study guardianships the 
panel has yet to meet 
joseph smallens the elderly affairs lawyer said he didnt know 
of any cases of limited guardianship in the state attorneys dont 
request it because traditionally lawyers are used to full 
guardianship probably because there is less paperwork involved 
a year down the road someone may have to come back and get full 
guardianship because the person continues to deteriorate 
rhode island with 146 percent of its population aged 65 or 
older ranks third in the percentage of elderly residents behind 
florida and even with pennsylvania according to the federal 
administration on aging

aftershocks still are rippling across the 
country five months after an obscure lawsuit filed by a federal 
retiree in michigan produced a supreme court ruling that upset tax 
laws in nearly half the states 
states are raising cutting and shifting taxes federal retirees 
are angling for more than a billion dollars in refunds and some 
private pensioners are claiming they too are victims of unfair 
state taxation 
the furor began when lawyer paul s davis filed suit in 1984 
claiming it was unfair for michigan to tax part of his federal 
pension when the state exempted the full pensions of state and local 
government retirees 
the supreme court agreed ruling in march that davis was entitled 
to a 4299 refund and ordering states to treat federal retirees at 
least as favorably as state and local retirees 
the decision hit home in as many as 24 states that didnt tax all 
government pensioners equally 12 of which have enacted corrective 
legislation according to the national conference of state 
legislatures 
but instead of making all federal retirement benefits exempt 
some states have imposed new taxes on a portion of state and local 
pensions 
for example missouri used to provide a full exemption for state 
pensions and none for federal now it provides a 6000 exclusion 
for all single public pensioners with income up to 25000 and for 
couples with public pensions up to 32000 there is no exclusion 
for those with higher incomes 
laws that exclude part of public pensions from taxation tend to 
benefit state and local retirees disproportionately because their 
pensions generally are lower said denis harrington of the national 
association of retired federal employees 
harrington said hed rather see states offer federal pensioners 
the same benefits other government retirees received in the past 
but as long as they comply with the supreme court ruling we 
havent got a leg to stand on 
the court left unsettled whether the states must refund tax 
payments by federal retirees most states are resisting refund 
requests lawsuits seeking refunds have been filed in nearly all the 
affected states and potential claims total 15 billion to 2 
billion for years within the states statutes of limitation 
according to the federation of tax administrators 
lawrence lewy a 75yearold former irs attorney believes he is 
due more than 10000 from virginia and is among those who have 
filed suit im not saying i wont be delighted with whatever 
eventually comes if we win lewy said but just the idea of the 
accomplishment is a big factor 
virginia has the most to lose if refunds are required an 
estimated 370 million for a threeyear period 
refunds so far have been forthcoming only for davis and in 
missouri where the state supreme court in may ordered 160 million 
in refunds covering three years the state will raise the money 
through temporary increases in the sales and corporate income taxes 
in arizona a tax judge this month ordered the state to reimburse 
72000 federal retirees up to 210 million on taxes paid from 1984 
through 1988 craig corimier deputy director of the arizona 
department of revenue said the ruling could be financially 
devastating if it stands since the state recently had trouble 
resolving a 165 million budget deficit 
harrington said the missouri and arizona rulings are encouraging 
but most states seem determined to go down fighting against the 
refunds 
every time we get a favorable decision it improves the odds 
dramatically its inevitable that theyre going to have to pay 
refunds of some kind 
attorney linda riley of the federation of tax administrators said 
states are watching each other on the refund question but she 
cautioned that laws vary from state to state and rulings wont 
necessarily go the same everywhere 
harrington and riley said many states are awaiting a supreme 
court ruling next term on two consolidated cases that will help 
determine when taxpayers are due a refund on a state tax that is 
found to be unconstitutional 
while the davis ruling addressed only disparities in taxation of 
pensions for government retirees it has sparked interest among 
private pensioners 
a retired teamsters union member in missouri and a group of 
private pensioners in alabama have filed suits in their states 
alleging that dissimilar tax treatment for private retirees is 
unconstitutional 
virginia one of the first to respond to the davis ruling 
enacted a taxreduction package that equalizes treatment for public 
and private retirees aged 55 and older at a cost of 70 million in 
the first year and 87 million by the third the state will exclude 
the first 16000 of pension income from taxation reducing the 
exclusion gradually for those with income from 16001 to 40000 
and providing no exclusion for those with income over 40000 
heres how the ncsl said other states have responded 
new york north dakota west virginia and wisconsin extended 
state preferences to federal retirees 
arizona oregon and south carolina repealed preferential state 
pension exclusions and raised other benefits for state retirees 
colorado iowa missouri and oklahoma now provide a limited 
exclusion for all public pensions 
georgia and utah have called special legislative sessions for 
the fall and michigans fulltime legislature may address the issue 
yet this year 
alabama kentucky louisiana mississippi montana new mexico 
and north carolina have yet to complete action 
in addition arkansas and kansas argue theyre not affected 
arkansas says a 1985 law providing equal treatment of government 
pensions after 1990 meets the requirements of the davis ruling 
kansas contends the ruling doesnt affect military pensions the 
only area of difference under state law

lissy jarvik disliked the notion she was 
doomed to get senile when she grew old so as a young psychologist 
in 1946 she began to study how age influences the brain 
i didnt want to believe our intelligence would go down from 
then on it didnt seem like a good thing to face for the rest of 
your life said jarvik now a psychiatrist pediatrician and 
geriatrician 
by giving intelligence tests to 134 pairs of elderly twins over 
four decades she concluded that old age alone doesnt rob people of 
their mental abilities and that when people do get senile its due 
to disease 
so its possible well die with all our marbles and thats all 
i care about said jarvik a psychiatry professor and chief of 
neuropsychogeriatrics at the university of california los angeles 
her research may help explain why some elderly people become senile 
while others remain sharp until death 
i dont think mental decline is necessary in old age we dont 
know yet how to prevent it but we have a lot of clues including 
the possibility that a healthy lifestyle including good nutrition 
and exercise and avoiding drugs alcohol cigarettes and pollution 
may help prevent or delay senility 
jarviks research also led her to speculate that people through 
lifestyle improvements might someday live to 120 or even 150 and 
that intelligence test scores might be used to identify people who 
face senility and need treatment 
dementia the preferred medical term is the loss of the ability 
to think clearly express oneself intelligently and do complex 
intellectual tasks 
her work certainly has contributed to change in the general 
idea about what happens in normal aging said psychologist david 
arenberg of the national institute on agings gerontology research 
center in baltimore 
the oncecontroversial idea that old age doesnt necessarily doom 
people to senility now is almost universally accepted said 
arenberg who studies how the elderly remember learn solve 
problems and process information 
but there still is disagreement over whether subtle loss of 
peoples mental faculties is due to disease 
jarvik said the elderly do tend to slow down mentally and 
physically and that some memory loss may be due to aging not 
disease 
but even if mental deterioration often rather than always 
results from some underlying disease there is hope that science can 
learn to help people postpone any loss of their intellectual 
abilities 
jarvik started her lifelong research project in 1946 when she 
went to work for columbia university psychiatrist franz kallmann 
kallmann had just started studying the 134 pairs of twins in 
their 50s and 60s to learn what environmental factors like 
lifestyle might be responsible for intellectual differences between 
members of each pair 
because identical twins are genetically identical and fraternal 
twins share inherited traits scientists assume somewhat 
simplistically that differences between them tend to be due to 
differences in their environment 
jarvik took over the study a couple years later administering 
intelligence tests to the twins about every five years many 
findings were published in the 1960s but the study continued until 
1986 after the last twins died 
the twins didnt necessarily decline intellectually after 60 
indeed as their average age rose from 64 to 73 they did better on 
all intelligence tests except those related to speed only as they 
reached their 80s did scores fall 
jarviks conclusion that disease not age was responsible was 
based on two other major findings of the study 
in every pair the twin who first showed a decline on certain 
intelligence test scores also was the first to die 
those who initially scored low on the tests were roughly four 
times more likely than highscorers to become senile 20 years later 
the findings indicate were dealing with some sort of a disease 
process that affects the brain she said such ailments may 
include those that attack the brain directly such as alzheimers 
disease and some process taking place elsewhere in the body that 
affects the blood supply to the brain 
that suggests that declining intelligence tests might be a way to 
detect the subtle beginnings of alzheimers attack on the brain or 
of brain impairment caused indirectly by other diseases jarvik 
said older people who believe they are losing their mental 
abilities might want to check with their doctor to see if theyre 
physically ill she said 
arenberg disagreed just because a person believes his or her 
mental capacity is diminishing doesnt mean that is accurate 
jarvik said her study also suggests that if science ever finds a 
way to prevent or treat alzheimers intelligence tests could be 
administered to aging people every three to five years to identify 
those likely to develop dementia they would be prime candidates 
for a preventive approach or a treatment

the gray party a new color on west 
germanys everexpanding political palette aims to unify 14 million 
senior citizens and poses yet another threat to the beleaguered 
party of chancellor helmut kohl 
nearly one in three west german voters is 65 and as life 
expectancy grows and the birth rate declines they promise to 
account for a hefty share of the electorate for years to come 
growing concerns over the future of the nations elaborate social 
security network and discontent with the established parties 
prompted the west german gray panthers to form their own political 
party last month 
falling in with the national penchant for adopting a color to 
symbolize the party the new political force of age advocates has 
labeled itself the grays 
trude unruh national chairman of the new party and the gray 
panthers chapter said the grays already have 1000 registered 
members and 3000 other letters have arrived over the past four 
weeks that she hasnt had time to open 
since we made the decision to represent ourselves the 
reception has been tremendous as much among the young as the old 
she said 
for the past four years affairs of the elderly have been 
included in the platform of the environmentalist greens and mrs 
unruh has served as a member of the federal bundestag parliament 
under the greens umbrella 
but the greens refused to guarantee senior citizens a fixed share 
of their parliamentary seats as it has set a 50 percent quota for 
women representatives so the gray panther faction broke off from 
the leftists in early july 
we tried to negotiate this with the greens for 10 months and 
got nowhere the 64yearold party leader said we no longer 
have confidence that our interests are represented by the 
established parties 
the grays are still a fledgling party and will require months of 
organizational work and campaigning before gaining a voice in west 
german state affairs mrs unruh acknowledged but she said the 
party would run candidates in the december 1990 national elections 
and expected to get at least the 5 percent of the vote needed to be 
seated in parliament 
a recent public opinion poll commissioned by stern magazine 
showed the grays with 65 percent of the vote that would be more 
than enough to earn it a small voice in federal affairs and the 
possible role of kingmaker in determining the fortunes of the two 
biggest parties 
smaller parties like the grays the greens the liberal free 
democrats symbolized by yellow and the ultrarightist republicans 
founded earlier this year have been drawing voters from kohls 
conservative christian democratic union and the leftleaning social 
democratic party spd 
neither of the leading parties has more than 40 percent of the 
vote so both the cdu and the outofpower spd are considering 
various alignments with smaller parties to win at least 50 percent 
of the vote next year 
berlins 2 million residents have been governed since march by a 
coalition of environmentalists and social democrats signified by 
red many expect a national redgreen coalition to be offered to 
voters next year or a stoplight coalition that would also 
include the free democrats 
mrs unruh said her party could not be easily cast into a leftor 
rightwing category but acknowledged that many members support the 
spd leader hansjochen vogel and that the grays might add their 
color to that rainbow 
the grays do not plan to run their own candidate for chancellor 
she said 
mrs unruh said her party in no way supports the antiforeigner 
sentiments gaining ground in west germany but that older citizens 
are worried about the burden the new arrivals are placing on a 
social security system already threatened by a declining pool of 
younger wage earners 
these calls of foreigners out are absolute rubbish she 
said but neither should foreigners and refugees have rights and 
privileges that exceed those of other citizens 
east german refugees and ethnic germans arriving from other east 
european countries qualify for immediate public assistance while 
pensions and benefits for west germans are based on their working 
years and contributions 
these are the kind of issues we must address mrs unruh 
said and we want the older generation to have an influence

pat phillipps is staying in downtown boston for a 
few months in a room with a view of the theatre district at her 
disposal are a swimming pool library and exercise room and she 
gets three meals a day 
rather than pay room and board phillipps will get about 2100 
but then most tourists arent called back if they dont clean their 
plate 
phillipps 68 and about 11 other people are housed not at the 
sheraton or the meridien but a tufts university laboratory 
youve got a private room private bath and you dont have to 
make up your bed if you dont want to she said of course i 
make up mine 
tufts nutrition research center on aging funded by the us 
department of agriculture runs experiments and studies with 
volunteers mainly older people for 50 to 3000 depending on the 
study subjects are fed and monitored 
the center in an effort to slow the aging process through diet 
and nutrition studies ways to impede the decay of the human body by 
osteoporosis arteriosclerosis cataracts and overall loss of 
physical capacity 
there are lifethreatening situations as people age 
debilitating situations said judy frazier metabolic research 
unit manager and director of nursing there really has to be a 
better way 
the studies can last from two months to five years including 
followup experiments the center since its inception in 1983 has 
completed 76 studies is working on 18 and has seven ready to go 
the main focus naturally is on diet and meals are monitored 
rigorously portions are carefully weighed and measured so the staff 
knows exactly how much protein cholestrol body fat and other 
elements the subjects are eating 
we look at food as chemicals said research dietician nadine 
sahyoun we are really a lab not a kitchen 
some studies require two identical meals one that ends up poured 
into a blender to be mixed together and inspected for overall 
content 
if a subject doesnt eat everything the study calls for even a 
dab of gravy left on the plate the rinse and scrape method is 
implemented the plate is squirted with a bit of water and the 
volunteer scrapes the plate with a spatula to ensure that every last 
bit of food is consumed if a volunteer is found to have dropped a 
pound or two his or her meals are enlarged 
most of the participants aside from the money like to 
contribute to the centers research and come from all over the 
country 
its a great organization great people said richard harris 
a retiree from el paso texas that makes it more pleasant than 
anything 
harris who participated in a vitamin b6 study last fall and was 
this year for a followup said he would receive 3000 
the center offers guided boat tours museum outings and other 
diversions and the nearby theaters provide entertainment 
chaperones used to keep the volunteers from sneaking over to 
chinatown for a plate of sweet and sour pork but most subjects 
welcome the chance to find out if theyve been eating right 
of course there are other reasons phillipps whose walpole home 
doesnt have air conditioning likes to take part in summer 
experiments so she can get some knitting done without her hands 
getting sweaty

at least 10 million adult americans suffer 
from loss of bladder control including 15 percent to 30 percent of 
older people who live in the community and at least half the 15 
million residents of nursing homes 
contrary to what many people think most incontinence in active 
older people as well as nursing home residents can be cured or 
improved treatments include drugs surgery and behavioral 
therapies such as bladder training 
incredible as it may seem at a time when almost no health 
condition is taboo most older americans afflicted with urinary 
incontinence have never told anyone not even their doctors 
instead they buy adult diapers and absorbent products to manage 
their secret condition assuming it incurable 
incontinence often causes shame and embarrassment about personal 
appearance and odor incontinent people isolate themselves from 
family and friends they restrict their activities outside the home 
and limit social interactions in many cases they become housebound 
prisoners in their own home 
wellmeaning but uninformed relatives may assume wrongly that 
nursing home care is the only option available for a family member 
with incontinence even more regrettable few nursing home residents 
who were incontinent beforehand or who developed the condition after 
admission have any type of diagnostic evaluation not to mention 
treatment or cure 
although researchers know a great deal about incontinence the 
number of people who are not treated successfully remains 
surprisingly high many people still believe it is due to aging 
agerelated changes in the urinary tract make older people likelier 
to develop incontinence but normal aging isnt the cause 
the most common forms of adult urinary incontinence which 
afflicts twice as many women as men are stress urge and overflow 
leakage of urine during exercise coughing sneezing laughing or 
other movements that put pressure on the bladder is stress 
incontinence people who sense a need to void but cannot hold urine 
long enough to reach a toilet have urge incontinence overflow 
incontinence occurs when small amounts of urine leak from a 
constantly filled bladder 
many cases of urinary incontinence are a mixture of more than one 
type older people who can control their urine but cannot reach a 
toilet because of arthritis or another crippling disability have 
functional incontinence 
often incontinence results from a combination of many factors 
including nerve damage restricted mobility illness confusion and 
medications in some cases it is temporary and can be cured by 
changing medications or by treating an acute illness such as a 
urinary tract infection however many cases are chronic lasting 
indefinitely unless properly diagnosed and treated 
the diagnosis of urinary incontinence includes a complete medical 
history careful physical examination and bladder tests patients 
record in a voiding diary each episode of incontinence what 
they were doing at the time and the amount of wetness the doctor 
also evaluates a persons mental health ability to perform 
activities such as bathing and dressing and living arrangements 
and asks about any associated illnesses operations and current 
medications 
most people with incontinence can be helped for example they 
can learn to control bladder and pelvic muscles through behavioral 
therapies like exercises biofeedback and bladder training 
beneficial drugs include bladder relaxants bladder outlet 
stimulants and estrogens surgery can support the bladder increase 
capacity implant a device to control the flow of urine or create a 
sling to support and compress an open urethra some patients may 
require a combination of treatments as a general rule the least 
invasive or least dangerous procedures should be tried first 
even when permanent improvement isnt possible frequent 
reminders to ask for help going to the toilet and an increase in the 
number of trips may reduce incontinence this technique can be 
especially useful in nursing home residents with incontinence other 
helpful changes include restricting liquids before bedtime 
providing easier access to toilet facilities and if necessary using 
absorbent products or a catheter a thin tube inserted to drain 
urine 
the fact that therapies are often effective makes it particularly 
tragic that so many people with incontinence do not seek treatment 
it is not a normal part of aging and people with this burdensome 
condition can be helped

even the simplest gardening tasks like 
sowing seeds may become formidable as you grow old but help is 
available from special tools to expert advice to keep your thumb 
green 
many gardeners devise their own ways to cope with or avoid the 
pain of pushing pulling handling stooping squatting and kneeling 
as digital dexterity waned i found tweezers indispensable to 
pick up tiny seeds and plant them just where i want them and at 
least one company harris seeds of rochester ny markets pelleted 
seeds encased in a white coating that makes them easier to see as 
well as handle 
some devices are expensive but others require only ingenuity and 
makedo materials for instance you can stack three old tires and 
fill the hole in the middle with soil to make a planter just high 
enough for easy tending from a wheelchair 
gardening indoors under fluorescent lights gives you many of the 
benefits and few of the inconveniences or the expense of a 
greenhouse you can start with a small twotube unit and go as far 
as you want fluorescent stands of all sizes are available at garden 
centers and hardware stores or you can make your own my wife and i 
share a custommade one along a wall of our dining room she does 
flowers and i grow salad greens in the winter and start plants for 
summer 
raisedbed and container gardening also make chores easier craig 
hospital of englewood colo has put out a booklet on raisedbed 
techniques which as the name implies essentially involve planting 
above ground level 
a similar pamphlet was published by the horticulture department 
of virginia polytechnic institute in blacksburg va and the 
american horticultural therapy association of gaithersburg md is 
a fruitful source of information for many aspects of gardening for 
the handicapped and elderly 
a few years ago the national gardening association of 
burlington vt put out a booklet called tools and techniques for 
easier gardening this is unfortunately out of print but may 
still be available through libraries 
divided into sections on soil preparation planting weeding 
cultivating watering and harvesting it lists scores of special 
tools and companies that marketed them it also abounds with 
homespun suggestions from many sources 
helen ashworth of heuvelton ny for example said a chair with 
boards attached to the legs so it wouldnt sink into the ground 
enabled her mother to hoe while sitting and thus continue gardening 
much longer than she expected 
eleanor patterson of san francisco suggested using barbecue tongs 
to pull weeds transplant small plants or remove dead leaves from 
hardtoreach areas 
you can buy kneeling pads make your own from a piece of foam 
rubber or just use old cushions lightweight combination 
kneelersitters are available easy to reverse and to grab onto to 
lower and lift yourself grips attached to the handles of shovels 
hoes spading forks or rakes reduce bending or arm strain hoes 
turned upside down become canes 
indoors there are planter pulleys enabling you to lower and lift 
hanging plants and lock them into any position for watering or other 
tasks 
if you regularly turn the soil of your vegetable garden power 
tillers as light as 17 pounds make the chore easier they come with 
various attachments including lawn thatchers but keeping a garden 
fertile by mulching with leaves grass clippings and other 
composting material eliminates much toil involving heavy equipment 
perennials also may reduce the volume of work especially in 
decorative gardening but a couple vegetables also come in this 
class asparagus beds may last 50 years and more rhubarb also 
repeats year after year with practically no care my modest 
asparagus patch 20 years old provided more than 700 spears this 
year in a harvest period lasting two months all i do is lay down a 
mulch of salt hay to keep down weeds and fertilize once a year 
among plants that need sowing annually squashes offer 
longlasting harvests as do broccoli pole beans and tomatoes of 
indeterminate varieties some lettuces are cutandcomeagain types 
ditto for new zealand spinach and swiss chard 
but the biggest help and encouragement for gardeners comes from 
the plants themselves they want to live and grow and they dont 
care whether you use tweezers to plant seeds or featherweight hoes 
to zap weeds

bills restoring a 1000 incometax 
exemption to the disabled and elderly and strengthening protections 
for senior citizens have been signed into law by gov james r 
thompson 
the tax measure which will be worth 30 per taxpaer beginning in 
the 1990 tax year restores an exemption erased by federal tax 
reform until 1987 both state and federal law allowed blind and 
elderly taxpayers to claim an extra personal exemption on their 
income taxes elimination of that tax break on the federal level 
also erased it for illinois taxpayers since state income tax 
calculations are based on the federal tax return 
other bills will establish an ombudsman in the state department 
on aging as an advocate for nursing home residents extend 
eligibility of some lowincome elderly for a program that pays for 
heart and diabetes drugs and create felony offenses for neglect or 
financial exploitation of an elderly or disabled person to aid

if southern pines can make it there theyll make 
it anywhere say the architects of an experiment to grow hybrid 
trees in the negev desert of israel 
using seeds for super pines developed in the southeast by 
atlantabased georgiapacific corp scientists are waiting to see 
if such trees will thrive in the dry unfriendly climate of the 
desert in a project they say could boost the fight against world 
hunger and global warming 
if the trees to be helped along with irrigation take root in 
the desert climate there will be potential for advancing the 
capability to grow food in other nonproductive regions of the 
world said stuart paskow spokesman for the jewish national fund 
which conducts agricultural research in israel 
if it works we can go into the third world he said from new 
york the ultimate answer to hunger is to put the source of food 
where the people are 
trees are essential to advancing agriculture in arid environments 
because they stabilize the land by slowing erosion paskow said the 
socalled super pine or loblolly pine developed by georgiapacific 
in georgia and south carolina through the crosspollination of 
several species matures more rapidly than ordinary pines 
georgiapacific donated three pounds of seedlings enough for 
about 100000 trees to the jewish national fund three months ago 
other than making sure the seedlings get water the experiment at 
this point is pretty much a waiting game paskow said 
the main thing is if they germinate then were in business 
he said it should be about a year 
by employing a drip irrigation system that distributes the 
scarce water according to plants needs the negev has been able to 
support some other plantings paskow said 
the negev is israels driest region and without irrigation the 
pines wouldnt stand a chance said walter jark corporate director 
of forest resources for georgiapacific 
if you overcome the dryness they ought to do quite well he 
said 
jark noted there are few sure things in nature 
the main obstacle we know about is the water but this is a 
test we might find other obstacles 
jark said the super pines have never been tested in areas with as 
little rainfall as the negev however except for the dryness the 
mild climate in israel is not much different than that of the 
southeastern united states he said 
researchers say a successful pine planting in the negev also 
would bode well for efforts to combat the global warming phenomenon 
or greenhouse effect by providing more trees to absorb carbon 
dioxide and release oxygen paskow said carbon dioxide which traps 
solar heat is one of the factors attributed by scientists to the 
global warming

two large boat manufacturers are trying to stay 
afloat after sinking sales hurt quarterly earnings and forced one 
company to send pink slips to 20 percent of its work force 
brunswick corp the nations largest recreational boat 
manufacturer based in skokie ill last month laid off 4000 
employees because of declining sales 
also last month brunswick reported a 75 percent plunge in 
secondquarter earnings from 683 million or 78 cents a share in 
the same quarter a year earlier 
outboard marine corp based in waukegan 40 miles north of 
chicago reported fiscal thirdquarter net income of 68 million a 
76 percent drop from the same period last year 
boating industry officials cant pin down exactly what happened 
although they have some theories 
rainy weather in the east the industrys largest market a late 
spring in the midwest and cooler weather in the south are partly 
responsible for the slump said william mcmanaman brunswicks vice 
president for finance 
a 14 percent interest rate on boat loans also may have kept away 
potential buyers he said fear of a recession also may be a factor 
consumers arent spending on big ticket items such as cars 
boats and real estate because of economic uncertainty said greg 
proteau a spokesman for the national marine manufacturers 
association a chicagobased trade organization that represents 400 
boat builders 
there had been indications that 1989 would be a banner year 
there was record attendance at boat shows in january february and 
march high consumer demand at dealerships followed the shows 
a lot of people shopped but few bought said gordy smith a 
boat dealer at waukegan marine co dreamers filled the showroom 
he said his sales dropped 50 percent in june and july 
outboard the nations thirdlargest boat manufacturer has 10 
subsidiaries including lowe chris craft sunbird and sea nymph 
the company also makes johnson and evinrude outboard motors and 
cobra stern drive engines 
recently it laid off nearly 300 workers because of the sales 
slump 
sydney heller a boating industry analyst for shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york predicts 1989 boat sales will drop 15 
percent to 20 percent from last year 
boyd poston an analyst with ag edwards amp sons in st louis 
said the industry is catching its breath after going full throttle 
for six years 
boating is in a cyclical pullback like in the past he said

trucks equipped with navistars new smokeless 
diesel engine will leave cleaner air in their wake instead of the 
characteristic black smoke of their predecessors officials of the 
truckmaker say 
this is a diesel for the 21st century this prototype model 
already meets the toughest 1994 state and federal pollution 
standards for diesel said vice president john horne of 
chicagobased navistar international corp 
the international 94 smokeless diesel also significantly reduces 
emissions of major pollutants company officials said friday 
trucks equipped with the engine probably will not reach the 
market until 1994 due to testing and fuel requirements the company 
said 
diesel engines commonly are favored by commercial operators 
because they give better fuel economy require less maintenance 
last longer and produce fewer pollutants than gasoline engines 
a major drawback is the smoke they emit federal regulators say 
the smokeless diesels development comes at a time when car and 
truck makers around the world are working to meet new state and 
federal emission guidelines 
by 1994 the us environmental protection agency will require 
that all diesel makers reduce particle emissions by 90 percent from 
1985 standards and cut carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide levels 
navistars new engine will solve the problem by using a new type 
of catalytic converter to reduce the amount of minute particles 
released to the environment navistar officials said 
the development of lowsulfur fuel also will prevent decay of the 
converter said officials of the company the nations leading 
producer of medium and heavyduty trucks 
emissioncontrol requirements will be so stringent by 1994 that 
manufacturers will virtually have to produce a smokeless engine 
said navistar spokesman bill greenhill 
officials of ford motor co the second leading manufacturer of 
trucks said they havent announced plans for meeting the standards 
but expect to follow similar techniques 
i would expect that we would do the same kinds of things 
theyre doing said ford spokesman john emmert from detroit i 
know were all in the same boat and were all going to have to meet 
those standards 
a fleet of trucks equipped with 94 of navistars new engines will 
begin openroad testing next year in southern california and the 
company plans to begin widespread circulation of the engine in 1994 
horne said in a news release 
he said trucks with the new engine would not reach the market 
until then because federal law requires that the catalytic converter 
be tested for 150000 miles 
the other major reason is that the lowsulfur fuel needed to 
allow the use of catalytic converters will not be widely available 
until oct 1 1993 he said

dire forecasts of summer gas lines and higher 
prices arent materializing and analysts say prices at the pump may 
be headed even lower as the vacation season draws to a close 
although consumers are paying about 15 cents a gallon more this 
summer than last nearly all the increases came in the two months 
following the exxon valdez oil spill last march since june retail 
prices in most areas have slipped slightly 
on june 13 the consumer group buyers up a division of the ralph 
naderfounded public citizen organization issued a report saying 
tight supplies and rising demand would lead to higher prices and 
possibly 1970sstyle gas lines by early august 
christopher dyson author of the report said then that he 
expected prices to jump about 10 cents a gallon during the summer 
mainly because of a supply squeeze 
in fact there have been no reported shortages of gasoline even 
in remote areas with heavy tourist traffic according to joseph 
koach executive director of the service stations dealers of 
america he noted that many industry groups as well as the bush 
administration had disputed buyers ups prediction 
theyve got to have egg on their faces koach said 
dyson in an interview last week acknowledged his report was off 
the mark but he said the nation still faced a precarious supply 
situation and that a refinery or pipeline accident could throw the 
retail gasoline market into crisis 
some other analysts in june agreed with dysons view that a 
supply crunch was possible but none went so far as to predict 
motorists would face backups at the gas pump 
dyson said he had totally underestimated the refining 
industrys ability to sustain an exceptionally high rate of 
production throughout the season 
that was the major reason our prediction didnt come out as it 
should have dyson said he also did not expect the high rates of 
summer oil production by major foreign producers that pushed down 
prices for crude used to make gasoline 
us refineries have run nearly full blast this summer using an 
average 898 percent of available capacity in june and 903 percent 
in july the july figure was the highest for any month in 11 years 
according to the american petroleum institute 
the risk of shortages also was eased by a lack of growth in 
gasoline use the energy department said demand in the first half of 
this year was unchanged from a year earlier although it says growth 
will resume soon last spring it had predicted about a 1 percent 
increase for this years first half 
summer usually is the peak period for gasoline consumption and 
demand normally tails off by september 
jan lundberg a private energy forecaster based in 
fredericksburg va said the recent slump in gasoline prices is 
clearly due to an unexpectedly weak summer driving season that he 
said could mean the economy is entering a recession 
lundberg and other analysts say prices are likely to continue 
dropping this fall although the pace and depth of decline will be 
determined in part by the willingness of wholesalers and station 
dealers to pass on savings from lower crude prices 
the energy department says it expects the average price of 
imported crude oil by summers end to be about 17 a barrel or 
about 10 percent lower than last spring theoretically that would 
mean a decline of about a nickel a gallon at the pump although many 
factors including state taxes could change that

bat industries plc today reported a 21 percent gain 
in its sixmonth earnings and sharply attacked financier james 
goldsmiths 21 billion hostile bid for the british conglomerate 
bat issued a response to a letter goldsmith sent sunday to bat 
chairman patrick sheehy goldsmith had requested a meeting to 
negotiate the terms of his allsecurities bid which values bat at 
134 billion pounds 
a bat spokesman said the company has no interest in talking with 
goldsmith or his partners british banker jacob rothschild and 
australian entrepreneur kerry packer who have formed hoylake 
investment ltd to try to take over bat 
the takeover of the british conglomerate would be the worlds 
second largest after the 2453 billion acquisition of rjr nabisco 
inc by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
hoylake has argued that bat shareholders would get far better 
value if bats assets were unbundled hoylake has said it would 
sell bats nontobacco businesses which include financial services 
retailing and paper 
in his letter goldsmith said all aspects of the hoylake offer 
were open to negotiation a possible indication the group was 
willing to offer some cash 
bat stock was up 6 pence at 819 pence a share at midmorning on 
londons stock exchange 
the conglomerate said its earnings in the six months ending june 
30 totaled 489 million pounds or 3207 pence per share compared 
with 404 million pounds or 2674 pence in the same period a year 
ago 
sales rose 23 percent to 10 billion pounds from 813 billion 
pounds 
bat does not release quarterly results it is not required to 
under british law 
the companys financial services segment turned in the best 
performance operating profit surged to 398 million pounds from 177 
million pounds 
bats results included a firsttime contribution from farmers 
insurance group inc the los angelesbased insurance company the 
conglomerate acquired last year for 52 billion 
bat said its tobacco business performed well contributing 404 
million pounds to operating profit compared with 361 million pounds 
a year ago 
the companys tobacco brands include kent and kool it also owns 
the saks fifth avenue and marshall fields stores 
bat termed the hoylake bid highly unattractive saying it 
consisted of a package of securities of dubious value it 
asserted that even hoylake admitted it may be impossible to sell 
the debt instruments it is offering for bat stock 
the company said hoylakes proposal to acquire bat rests on a 
bewildering array of interlocking companies most of whom are 
resident in tax havens its vastly complex structure is designed to 
add an enormous amount of money to the already substantial fortunes 
of goldsmith rothschild and packer at the expense of the 
shareholders of bat

in manhattan where even the air is for sale 
developers are wheeling and dealing to keep building higher and 
denser on an island that isnt getting any bigger 
donald trump wants to use the rights he owns to land under the 
hudson river to create the worlds tallest building across town 
the owner of the air space above grand central terminal has been 
battling for more than 11 years to convert it to glass steel and 
cash on the ground 
its a logical extension of the cleverness of new york city 
developers lawyers says steve robinson cochairman of 
westpride a community organization fighting excessive development 
they push the limits they invent new mechanisms they try 
anything that may have a shot at working because there are so many 
dollars at stake 
dozens of office and apartment buildings are going up in new 
yorks midtown area alone especially around times square 
under the citys complex zoning laws the sale of air rights has 
become commonplace it works this way an investor owns say a 
fivestory building in an area where 10story buildings are allowed 
he or she sells the unused air space to a neighbor who then 
gets the right to build a 15story building with air rights 
purchases and other maneuvers such as offering to build public 
plazas or lowcost housing in exchange for waiver of size 
restrictions developers have managed to put up bigger buildings 
than the zoning law would otherwise allow but such actions have 
raised cries of foul 
on street corners all over manhattan you have 
disproportionately large buildings going up said sandor e katz 
of the womens city club of new york a civic organization there 
needs to be some absolute limit on the amount of additional floor 
area that can be imposed on any one lot 
civic groups are focusing on trump city the billionaire 
developers massive west side project katz calls it the most 
dramatic single example of the kind of monstrous result you can get 
by the accumulation of development rights 
westpride targeted it from early on 
if we are able to have an impact on what trump proposes then 
other developers in the city would begin to get the signal says 
robinson 
on 76 acres of old railroad yards along the hudson river between 
59th and 72nd streets the largest undeveloped land parcel in the 
city trump city would include a 150story structure and 13 other 
buildings ranging from 13 to 60 floors besides offices hotel space 
and apartments there would be an 800000squarefoot shopping mall 
westpride says the 7600 housing units would heavily overburden 
the neighborhoods schools and sewers and that the tower the 
worlds tallest would cast a shadow across the hudson river and 
central park trumps people say there are plenty of sewers and 
schools and that the shadow would not be that obtrusive in a city 
full of skyscrapers 
trump wants to transfer to his shoreline property the development 
rights he owns to 19 acres under the hudson river a holdover from 
the days when waterfront industry extended onto the piers 
william valletta counsel to the department of city planning 
said that the citys zoning law allows a lots overall size 
including underwater rights to be the basis for determining the 
size limits of a building zoning reformers want to get rid of that 
provision 
trump hopes to start building in mid1990 
on the east side developers are hoping to use the air rights 
created by the space above the grand central commuter train terminal 
to build the citys fourthlargest skyscraper nearby 
in 1978 the supreme court backed the city in blocking grand 
centrals owner the penn central corp from building a 53story 
office tower atop the landmark train station 
but the court said it might reconsider if penn central found it 
couldnt use the leftover development rights on the station site or 
get compensation by transferring them according to a penn central 
attorney 
in 1983 penn central contracted to sell up to 15 million square 
feet of air rights to 383 madison associates which wants to use 
about half of the rights for a 74story building at its address 
several blocks away 
the zoning law allows such transfers from a landmark to an 
adjacent lot penn central owns the underground land used for train 
tracks between the terminal and 383 madison and it and the 
developers hope the rights to this land will qualify the properties 
as adjacent thus facilitating the transfer 
the local community board rejected the 383 madison ave proposal 
in june but it could be overturned by the city planning commission 
which is voting on the plan this week

the number of working oil and gas rigs in the 
country rose by 45 to total 903 last week baker hughes inc 
reported 
the steep increase partly was due to areas drying out from the 
heavy rains brought on by hurricane chantal several weeks ago said 
ike kerridge vice president of stockholder relations and economist 
for baker hughes 
the increase however was somewhat anticipated he said 
all the surveys done said there would be more drilling in the 
second half of the year i wouldnt be surprised if we didnt have a 
steady increase for the remainder of the year 
in texas which accounted for more than half of the total rig 
increase the drilling activity was focused the east and north 
central portions of the state kerridge said 
a year ago the count totaled 937 baker hughes said monday 
the companys rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing 
oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
among major oil producing states texas had the biggest gain with 
27 followed by ohio six kansas and wyoming three each california 
and pennsylvania two each and michigan one 
north dakota posted a loss of two and colorado and louisiana lost 
one each new mexico and oklahoma saw no change from last week

striking telephone workers in california and 
nevada returned to work today following a tentative threeyear 
contract agreement offering modest pay increases and healthcare 
cost controls 
our members are comfortable with this contract and theyre 
feeling very good about what theyve won what they feel they fought 
very hard for said jessie wilson president of local 9415 of the 
communications workers of america 
most of the 42500 telephone operators repair people and factory 
workers for pacific bell and the nevada bell telephone co were back 
on the job or already scheduled for their next shift pacific bell 
spokesman richard fitzmaurice said today 
meanwhile the strike at bell atlantic which covers six 
midatlantic states and washington dc moved a step closer to 
agreement sunday when the companys pennsylvania subsidiary settled 
with one of two striking unions 
strikes continued at nynex serving new york and the northeast 
and at ameritech which covers five midwestern states no talks were 
scheduled in those two strikes 
the three continuing strikes involve more than 150000 workers 
on sunday workers at pacific bell and nevada bell telephone co 
subsidiaries of pacific telesis began relieving 17000 supervisors 
who took over daytoday operations following the walkout 16 days 
ago 
as at the other strikebound companies managers had been working 
12 hours a day six days a week to maintain service for pactels 132 
million customers there were minor delays in operatorassisted 
calls installations and repairs 
after several marathon sessions a draft of the tentative pact 
was drawn up early sunday and formalized later by negotiators 
workers won increases in wages bonuses and other payments that 
will raise overall salaries by 11 percent over three years wilson 
said 
pay currently ranges from about 228 a week for some operators to 
650 for some skilled technicians according to union figures 
the proposed contract would grant wage increases of 31 percent 
for the first year 37 percent the next and 26 percent for the 
final year 
pactel also won agreement to set up a network of doctors and 
hospitals to provide health care for employees workers would pay 
10 for most visits while receiving free preventive care employees 
would have to pay more if they seek treatment from doctors and 
hospitals outside the network 
company efforts to get employees to share part of their soaring 
healthcare costs have been a major factor in several of the strikes 
the contract also contains a nolayoff clause and provides added 
family benefits such as a 2000 reimbursement for adoption costs 
and tax benefits for dependent care 
the contract must be approved by the membership but a 
ratification vote isnt expected to be completed until sept 22 
said lynn jimenez a spokeswoman for pacific bell 
company officials complained there had been 450 serious acts of 
sabotage or vandalism during the walkout they said rewards of 
10000 to 25000 for information leading to an arrest and 
conviction remain in effect 
in philadelphia representatives of the international brotherhood 
of electrical workers reached a tentative agreement sunday with bell 
of pennsylvania 
the subsidiary announced the settlement was similar to a deal 
reached thursday between the cwa and bell atlantic 
but ibew workers will stay off the job until bell of pennsylvania 
settles local issues with the cwa and an agreement is reached 
between the ibew and sister company new jersey bell officials said 
its a step forward but were not really going anywhere 
said chuck schalch a bell of pennsylvania spokesman were hoping 
the cwa isnt far behind 
bell of pennsylvanias tentative deal with the 1900 ibew members 
calls for a 75 percent pay increase over three years a 
profitsharing plan that could provide workers as much as 600 a 
year and a new healthcare arrangement intended to hold down costs 
the company said

an investment group that includes former baseball 
commissioner peter v ueberroth is buying the financially struggling 
parent of hawaiian airlines company officials said 
hal inc said sunday its board of directors unanimously accepted 
a tender offer of 22 a share from the group headed by j thomas 
talbot a former airline executive from california the group plans 
to obtain at least 51 percent of the companys stock making its 
offer worth around 22 million 
hal stock boosted in recent months by takeover rumors has been 
trading far above the 22 offered by the talbot group closing at 
3162 a share friday on the american stock exchange the shares 
were trading at the same level this morning after a temporary halt 
earlier this month rumors circulated that delta air lines was 
interested in acquiring hal to ward off a takeover itself and to 
gain access to hawaiian airlines south pacific and japanese routes 
the rumors were denied by hal 
but hal sustained a loss of 13 million in the first half of this

it down to earth a little bit 
last spring ueberroth and talbot headed a group which made a 
464 million bid for strikebound eastern airlines in partnership

john magoon jr hals chairman and chief executive officer owns 
569 percent of the companys 19 million outstanding shares of

teenagers beth young and nate deslandes 
have no desire to spend their lives baling hay and milking cows but 
they didnt mind spending the last two months in a program intended 
to give them farm experience while giving farmers a hand 
weve had some problems but we had some really nice success 
stories too and we had some farms having some good experiences 
said greg voorheis who runs the farm youth corps a pilot program 
for the state department of employment and training 
the corps matched people aged 16 to 21 from northern vermont with 
farm jobs the goal was to alleviate a labor shortage while the 
young people gained experience and money for a summers work 
farmers around the northeast have especially had trouble hiring 
help since wages at hamburger joints have risen to 6 or 7 an hour 
few farmers can offer more than 4 an hour for harder work longer 
days and fewer benefits 
one of my friends said he knew a kid who said i dont touch a 
bale for less than 7 an hour said john lincoln of westfield 
the farm youth corps took care of the problem of finding young 
people who were willing to work for less money a combination of 
state and federal funds plus some volunteers provided training 
the farmers pay their hired hands 4 an hour and state funds 
will pay the youths a 1anhour bonus at the end of the summer 
the idea for the corps came out of a survey of vermonts 2500 
dairy farms more than onethird of the 700 respondents said a lack 
of employees kept them from expanding nearly twothirds said they 
would consider hiring young vermonters for the summer if the state 
would help find them 
young 17 hooked up with jim jones a craftsbury farmer 
i like being outdoors and ive been around a farm said 
young who rides her bike two and a half miles to jones farm each 
day i like the animals i think i like milking its nice after 
working hard in the woods all day and just joking with jim or 
whatever 
the experience helped confirm that shed rather not farm for a 
living 
its a lot of hard work and its stressful she said but i 
think the corps is a good idea because farmers need help and i 
think kids are a lot more willing to work than people think 
most kids voorheis said eight of the 20 youths dropped out of 
the program 
youngs supervisor danny paquin said one girl dropped out 
because she couldnt stand the thought of sending cows and calves to 
slaughter

world bank loans to afghanistan have been cut 
off because the government has paid nothing on its old debts for six 
months bank spokesman peter riddleberger said monday 
he said the action taken by the banks staff was reported last 
week to the board of executive directors the boards 22 members 
represent the countries that own the bank 
afghanistans communist government with help from the soviet 
union is battling a strong guerrilla movement helped by the united 
states it has fallen behind in its payments on 792 million of 
debts to the bank the banks rules require the cutoff when the 
arrears pile up for six months 
as one of the worlds poorest countries afghanistan borrowed 
from the world bank groups international development association 
ida the loans were made at less than 1 percent interest a year 
with as long as 50 years to repay money for such loans comes from 
direct contributions by more than 30 donor countries with the 
largest contribution made by the united states 
afghanistan is the first country to be cut off from this fund 
the world bank group the largest source of aid loans to the 
third world lends larger amounts to somewhat more prosperous 
countries through its international bank for reconstruction and 
development ibrd the ibrd is owned by 151 governments including 
borrowers the united states holds the largest block of shares 
this money comes largely from the proceeds of bonds that the bank 
has floated on world markets and which it lends out again at rates 
closer to those charged by commercial banks many borrowing 
countries cannot get loans from commercial banks however and the 
ibrd gives borrowers much longer periods to repay than such banks 
will accept 
nine countries have been cut off from these loans because they 
have piled up arrears for six months or more honduras guyana 
liberia nicaragua panama peru sierra leone syria and zambia 
together they owe the bank more than 319 billion sheldon 
rappaport another bank spokesman pointed out that this amounts to 
only 41 percent of the 779 billion that ibrd has in outstanding

grain futures prices were mostly lower but 
soybean prices were sharply higher following a dramatic turnaround 
monday on the chicago board of trade 
traders credited heavy professional buying reportedly led by 
refco inc and rosenthalcollins in lots of 2 million bushels each 
with sparking the turnaround 
soybean futures drifted lower at the opening bell after a series 
of storms over the weekend brightened prospects for the crop after 
prices held stronger than expected though buyers stepped in and 
began the upward move 
also supporting prices were expectations that a us department 
of agriculture report due out after the close of trading will show 
that the condition of crops in the field has declined in recent days

the contract for delivery in september at 390 a bushel corn was

bat industries plc chairman patrick sheehy on 
monday rebuffed financier sir james goldsmiths offer to negotiate 
the terms of his hostile 21 billion bid for the british 
conglomerate 
sheehy also unveiled his companys defensive strategy aimed at 
convincing shareholders they will profit more by holding on to their 
bat stock than by tendering it to hoylake investments ltd the 
investor group led by goldsmith 
underscoring that argument bat announced monday its earnings for 
the quarter ended june 30 rose nearly 22 percent 
the defensive plank is on the performance of the businesses 
bat deputy chairman brian garraway said as his company released a 
statement known as a defense document 
the document stated that since 1980 bat industries has 
delivered long term superior total returns to shareholders it 
also emphasized the strengths of bats businesses which include 
tobacco financial services retailing and paper 
hoylake which also includes british merchant banker jacob 
rothschild and australian entrepreneur kerry packer responded that 
the document sidestepped issues such as the failure of bats tobacco 
interests strategic blunders in its retailing diversification and 
fundamental flaws in its conglomerate structure 
a takeover of bat would be the worlds secondlargest after the 
2453 billion acquisition of rjr nabisco inc by kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co earlier this year 
on sunday goldsmith wrote sheehy inviting you and your 
colleagues to sit down and negotiate with us an offer all aspects 
of which are open to negotiation 
the approach could be an indication that the bidding group is 
willing to offer some cash 
however sheehy said monday cash would not sway him he said he 
was refusing to meet with goldsmith because his objectives are 
totally different to ours he wants to destroy the company 
hoylake has that if its offer succeeded it would sell off all of 
bats nontobacco businesses it has argued that bat shareholders 
would get far better value if bats assets were unbundled 
theres going to be no meeting of minds sheehy said if 
you start with two polarized objectives then theres no point in 
meeting 
sheehy called goldsmiths offer to buy bat for securities worth 
134 billion pounds unattractive and opportunistic 
in its earnings report bat said its net income for the quarter 
ended june 30 totaled 297 million pounds or 466 million up from 
244 million pounds or 383 million a year earlier 
sales rose 26 percent to 525 billion pounds or 82 billion 
from 42 billion pounds or 66 billion 
bat said it earned 489 million pounds or 768 million in the 
six months ended june 30 compared with 404 million pounds or 634 
million in the same period a year ago 
sales for the period rose to 10 billion pounds or 157 billion 
from 813 billion pounds 127 billion 
bat is using what is sometimes called a just say no defense 
against goldsmith securities analysts said they expected bat had 
other ammunition besides its earnings record but would save it for 
possible use against a sweetened bid 
theyre bat keeping their powder dry for later on in the 
bid said a london securities analyst who requested anonymity 
the securities analyst said bat itself is going to remain 
under a lot of pressure to unlock value to shareholders 
there had been speculation that bat might respond by breaking 
itself up perhaps by separating its four main businesses and 
creating a new stock for each 
this idea reportedly put forward by some bat institutional 
shareholders would get around the problem of bats relatively 
slowgrowing tobacco business pulling down its share price 
sheehy noted monday that bat has sold off underperforming 
businesses in the past and that its a continuing process we 
havent called a halt to it 
he said he had met with some of bats institutional shareholders 
they have indicated to us that they would not like the shares to 
fall after all this is over back to the undervalued situation of 
before he said 
bat is hoping that regulatory authorities will block the hoylake 
bid us insurance regulators are studying the offer because bat 
owns farmers insurance group inc of los angeles 
in addition 200 us congressmen oppose the bid we are 
encouraged by that sheehy said

wang laboratories inc announced monday it 
had successfully restructured its credit agreement with banks and 
will make loan repayments it suspended last week 
wang said its bank lenders had agreed to raise the computer 
makers line of credit by 100 million to a total of 575 million 
in exchange the previously unsecured line of credit will be secured 
by the entire companys assets excluding inventory which puts the 
banks in line behind the bondholders in case of a liquidation 
the deal also delays the payback for a 125 million portion of 
the credit line that was to become due on sept 30 payments for 
that loan will begin on july 15 1990 
wang is hoping to raise 175 million for working capital by 
selling assets such as a factory in scotland its credit and leasing 
subsidiary and possibly its headquarters which it would then lease 
back 
the agreement with the banks requires that any money raised 
beyond that 175 million go toward paying off its fiscal 1990 bank 
obligations ahead of time if possible 
the company believes that this debt restructuring together 
with the completion of the 175 million of additional secured 
financings will provide the company with the financing required to 
meet its business plan an wang founder and chief executive 
officer of the company said in a brief statement 
wang began renegotiating its lending agreements with banks after 
posting record losses of 424 million in fiscal 1989 which ended 
june 30 the company also announced earlier this month that 
frederick wang wangs eldest son was stepping aside as president 
of the company 
wang said the company continues to explore sale of certain 
portions of the business including domestic and international 
leasing subsidiaries he also said the search for a new president 
is proceeding rapidly 
wang labs startled investors last week when it suspended payments 
on some 209 million in debt while negotiating for new credit terms 
wang fell into technical default on its credit agreements on june 
30 after it posted a record 424 million annual loss 
wang and its lenders led by bank of boston signed the new 
credit agreement after a weekend of intensive bargaining 
wangs eight lender banks are bank of boston chase manhattan 
first chicago baybanks bank of america harris bank mellon bank 
and chemical bank 
as of june 30 the last report available wang had borrowed a 
total of 2091 million but how much of that came from the credit 
line was not reported separately

be nearly 10 percent too high malaysia the fourthleading producer 
and considered by many a crucial player in any icco pact reiterated 
it would not join the organization until it sorts out domestic 
problems 
the market was very demoralized its clear theres much cocoa 
already out there and the 198990 crop is in very good shape 
said arthur stevenson who tracks cocoa for prudentialbache 
securities inc new york and matters could be further 
complicated if there is continued disagreement over what price can 
be defended

higher on the chicago board of trade

the 25 billion merger of the lucky and alpha 
beta supermarket chains in california was blocked monday by supreme 
court justice sandra day oconnor apparently at least until early 
october 
oconnor issued an order halting the merger at the request of 
state attorney general john van de kamp who contends that the 
reduced competition would cost california shoppers 400 million a 
year 
the chains which have a total of 550 stores were to have 
combined their operations under the lucky banner an appeals court 
order blocking the merger was to have expired monday though the 
process of consolidation would have taken several months 
oconnors order which was not accompanied by a written opinion 
forbids the merger until the full supreme court decides whether to 
grant a hearing on van de kamps appeal 
the court reconvenes oct 2 and is not likely to take up the 
issue until then if the court grants a hearing an action that 
requires votes from four of the nine justices the stay will be 
extended until the court rules in the case oconnor said 
this order means that a merger threatening california shoppers 
with hundreds of millions of dollars in higher grocery bills will 
not take place until the united states supreme court can review 
it van de kamp said in a statement he said he anticipates court 
action in early october 
chief assistant attorney general andrea ordin said oconnors 
order apparently does not require van de kamp to post a 163 
million bond that a federal judge had earlier required as a 
condition of the appeal van de kamp had said he would drop the 
appeal if the bond were required 
i feel it does show that we have raised a very significant 
issue whether the remedy of divestiture keeping the two entities 
apart or being permitted to separate the two entities is 
available ms ordin said of oconnors order 
troy dambrosio spokesman for american stores co alpha betas 
parent declined comment 
american stores bought lucky in june 1988 and predicted that 
increased efficiency from the consolidation would save california 
customers 50 million to 60 million a year lucky is the states 
largest grocery chain alpha beta the fourth largest 
the federal trade commission approved the merger but van de 
kamp in a suit claiming violation of federal antitrust law 
contended that the merged chain would dominate the marketplace in 
many areas and lead to higher prices 
us district judge david kenyon of los angeles issued a 
preliminary injunction last september ordering separate operation of 
the chains finding a likelihood of reduced competition 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals said this march that there 
was evidence to support kenyons finding but overruled his 
injunction against the merger saying it was too late to undo the 
merger once the ftc had approved it 
kenyon then required van de kamp to post a 163 million bond in 
order to block the merger while appealing to the supreme court 
saying the money was needed to cover american stores losses from a 
delay of the merger 
van de kamp disputed the companys claim of losses and also 
argued that he should be exempt from the bond because he was suing 
on behalf of the states consumers 
the appeals court did not lift the bond requirement however in 
an order last thursday that said the merger could proceed monday 
van de kamp appealed to oconnor who handles emergency appeals from 
9th circuit rulings and she intervened monday before american 
stores could begin final action on the merger

defeated in a highprofile attempt to buy eastern 
airlines former baseball commissioner peter v ueberroth has turned 
his attention to another financially struggling carrier 
ueberroth whose first job after college was with a small airline 
in hawaii is part of an investment group that has agreed to buy hal 
inc the parent of hawaiian airlines the sports figure has gained 
a reputation in professional baseball and the olympics for turning 
problem enterprises into moneymakers 
hal said sunday its board of directors unanimously accepted a 
tender offer of 22 a share from the group headed by j thomas 
talbot a former airline executive from california 
the group which also includes ueberroths brother john plans to 
obtain at least 51 percent of hals stock at 22 a share the group 
could purchase a majority of the companys 195 million outstanding 
shares of common stock for about 219 million 
hal stock boosted in recent months by takeover rumors plunged 
on the american stock exchange from its friday closing of 3162 a 
share to 2525 a share monday 
i thought the other stock price was probably an inflated 
one said louis marckesano an airline analyst with janney 
montgomery scott inc in philadelphia i think maybe this brings 
it down to earth a little bit 
talbot reached at a honolulu hotel said his group plans to 
improve hawaiian airlines service with an infusion of capital in 
the form of better planes and equipment 
the company has built up a strong base first with its 60 years 
in the interisland markets and now reaching out to the mainland 
talbot said we think the employees who have been here for years 
are very strong 
talbot said his group was attracted by hawaiians established 
routes in the pacific basin which he called a booming air travel 
market 
talbot said he and ueberroth who was on the mainland would hold 
a news conference next week to discuss their plans for the airline 
hal denied rumors earlier this month that delta air lines was 
interested in acquiring it to ward off a takeover itself and gain 
access fo hawaiian airlines south pacific and japanese routes 
hal sustained a loss of 13 million in the first half of this 
year and has lost a total of 306 million over the past 2 years 
honolulu stockbroker randy havre of jb havre securities inc 
said the 22ashare offer was reasonable for longterm investors 
and even was paying shareholders a premium on the stocks value 
which he estimated to be between 15 and 20 a share 
the bottom line is the employees are going to win on this 
because theyre getting new management which will reduce the 
instability caused by financial losses over the past few years 
havre said 
he attributed hals consistent losses to the high cost of 
maintaining its aging aircraft 
hal spokesman keoni wagner said he did not know how great a role 
ueberroth would play in the company there were reports monday that 
he could become cochairman with john magoon jr hals current 
chairman and chief executive officer 
ueberroth was unavailable for comment monday on the takeover bid 
last spring ueberroth and talbot headed a group which made a 
464 million bid for strikebound eastern in partnership with its 
three unions the deal later fell apart over the unions demand that 
frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp be 
removed from daily control of the airline 
after graduating from san jose state college in california in 
1959 ueberroth worked for trans international airlines in hawaii as 
an operations manager and vice president through 1962 
hal completed a deal last year giving a subsidiary of japan air 
lines a 20 percent ownership stake and infusing almost 20 million 
into hawaiian airlines 
in its june 26 issue forbes magazine blasted the airline in an 
article entitled whats hawaiian for rotten management 
how do you flirt with bankruptcy in a business that is 
indispensable during an unprecedented boom the article read 
you get swellheaded expand stupidly manage poorly neglect 
maintenance delay and cancel flights and then plunge into a ruinous 
price war trying to get a market share 
the magazine charged that magoon has managed to run the states 
leading carrier almost into the ground 
magoon owns 569 percent of hals common stock 
hal called the forbes article superficial and subjective 
hawaiian airlines hawaiis largest interisland airline also 
serves los angeles san francisco seattle anchorage alaska las 
vegas nev australia new zealand and other south pacific points 
the 60yearold airlines fleet of 31 planes carried 55 million 
passengers in 1988 
the tender offer is subject to a number of conditions including 
a satisfactory agreement with the companys unions financing and 
receipt of the required approvals from government agencies hal said 
lindsey pollock hawaiians senior vice president of marketing 
said hal would call a shareholders meeting for next week for a vote 
on the offer 
hawaiians major interisland competitor is aloha airlines which 
had no immediate comment on the purchase according to aloha 
spokeswoman stephanie ackerman 
hawaiian consistently has ranked among the nations leaders in 
consumer complaints compiled by the department of transportation for 
problems with overbooking reservations ticketing fares refunds 
baggage handling and customer service

an industry watchdog group said monday that it 
found no grounds for substantiating montgomery ward amp cos 
contention that sears roebuck and cos everyday low pricing ad 
campaign is misleading 
ward complained to the better business bureaus national 
advertising division or nad that the campaign was misleading and 
deceptive to consumers ward challenged sears statement that it had 
reduced prices on 50000 items complaining that sears treated each 
size and color variation as a separate unit 
different colors or designs of the same product were counted as 
separate if consumers commonly view them as different for example 
whitewall versus blackwall tires white shirts versus stripes the 
nad report said the 50000 count was substantiated 
both retail giants are based in chicago and their chief 
executives are brothers 
the ward complaint filed april 7 focused only on the first six 
weeks of the sears ad campaign which was launched march 1 
ward chairman bernard brennan said the company is disappointed 
with the finding 
the findings speak for themselves a sears spokesman said 
in the complaint ward also said sears was actually raising 
prices on several items marked as lowered in price 
the nad disputed that contention 
ward also said that sears pricematching policy on identical 
items carried in other stores particularly appliances and 
electronics was misleading 
ward also said that in the first weeks of the new pricing format 
sears refused to match competitors prices as advertised much of 
the merchandise carried sears own labels and salespeople claimed 
items werent directly comparable to those offered by competitors 
the complaint said 
the nad upheld the ads on this issue as well but requested that 
sears pricematching policy be examined further to clearly state 
which merchandise is identical to competitors items 
the group also recommended that a committee be formed with 
members including sears and ward personnel to study whether sears 
should clarify the way it handles pricematching 
nad agreed customers were provided a sufficient choice of 
national brands to ensure the storewide pricematching pledge was 
not illusory the report said 
however nad expressed concern that customers might remain 
uninformed that the pricematching policy applies to derivative 
models unless they request advice from a sales associate
