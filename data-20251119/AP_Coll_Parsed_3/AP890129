a plan to race 40000 rubber ducks down the 
white river to raise money for a food bank has been sunk by concerns 
about indianas gambling laws 
the state attorney generals office and private attorneys advised 
organizers the event would be considered an illegal lottery but 
organizers hope state lawmakers will pass legislation enabling the 
great american rubber duck race originally scheduled for april to 
go off by september 
gleaners food bank inc of indiana has intended to sell numbered 
ducks for 10 each and raise 400000 for transporting food across 
the state the first 15 ducks across the finish line would have 
brought prizes 
j bradford senden an organizer said each 10 donation would 
have moved 65 pounds of food through the system serving 825 agencies 
in indiana 
a rubber duck race is the sort of fun harmless family event 
that can be a tremendous benefit to a charitys serious 
peoplehelping agenda senden said in announcing the postponement 
it was simply an effort to make sure smaller agencies throughout 
the state get food with no transportation costs 
with lottery proposals now circulating in the statehouse senden

colleges have tried many tactics to 
attract capable minority students and make them feel welcome 
offered special scholarships started support groups hired 
counselors overlooked low test scores 
at gettysburg college theyre about to try genealogy 
starting in march this lutheranaffiliated liberal arts school 
where just 40 of 1850 students are black is opening an 
intercultural resource center where all students but especially 
africanamericans can learn how to research their family roots 
the twostory woodframe center when it is officially dedicated 
at a march 18 ceremony will coordinate a campuswide effort to help 
minority students develop selfawareness and confidence 
the ultimate aim to break down the sense of isolation blacks 
often feel on this campus help them be part of the mainstream and 
eventually use their selfawareness to strive for leadership roles 
already the centers bookshelves are packed with state census 
records from 40 states dating back to the early 1800s thick brown 
volumes contain ship passenger and immigration lists dating back to 
the 18th century there are also genealogy guides for germans 
italians american indians danes finns russians and english 
i dont know that much about myself and i want to know said 
dawn hadnott a 17yearold freshman from teaneck nj one of 
several black students who told a visitor they were eager to get 
started on genealogical studies i think i have some indian in me 
my greatgrandmother moan 
i think theres a lack of pride in the black community said 
troy datcher a 20yearold junior who is president of the black 
student union i think it can be rebuilt with a program like this 
maybe you can find out that you were related to someone famous 
at a time of racial tension on many other campuses gettysburgs 
aim is to foster toleration through appreciation and knowledge of 
cultural diversity says harry bradshaw matthews the schools 
37yearold dean of intercultural advancement 
if black students know more about themselves the reasoning goes 
they will be better prepared to fit into a college environment as 
minorities and more inclined to stay the full four years they 
might also be inclined to spread the word to their friends 
the new gettysburg center is unusual on several counts probably 
no other school so small has focused such attention on 
africanamerican genealogy according to james dent walker a 
founder of the washingtonbased afroamerican historical and 
genealogical society the much larger temple university in 
philadelphia houses the charles l blockson afroamerican collection 
which contains over 40000 items 
second gettysburg pointedly chose not to name it an 
afroamerican center or black student center as many 
colleges have the idea was to have a place on campus celebrating 
all cultures 
finally gettysburg may be the first college to view genealogy as 
a vehicle for recruiting and retaining minority students 
that strategy may lack the glitz or quickfix appeal of setting 
numerical minority recruitment goals or quotas as other colleges 
have but gettysburg never did 
but matthews says he has already used his approach successfully 
as a minority counselor at two other predominantly white campuses 
northern michigan university and the affiliated hobart and william 
smith colleges in geneva ny 
now he confidently predicts gettysburg will end up with a name 
across the united states as a place for the advancement of 
africanamerican and other minority students 
yet gettysburg seems hardly the most fertile place for an 
innovative approach to black student recruitment despite its 
location adjacent to the civil war battlefield where abraham lincoln 
delivered his address that became an anthem in the history of race 
relations 
college guides such as the yale insiders guide have 
described gettysburgs students as all alike and white and 
upper middleclass 
the descriptions are all too true admits president charles 
glassick 
black students here say that while seldom the target of overt 
racism they often feel shunned and isolated 
most students here never interacted with blacks and at 
gettysburg its possible to avoid that said michael warren a 
22yearold senior majoring in africanamerican studies 
we were frankly interested in enrolling more minority students 
so we brought in harry matthews said glassick 
well under 100 blacks were applying to gettysburg each year and 
the retention rate of those who attend had been abominable said 
glassick the rate was 46 percent in the 1970s though that has 
recently improved to around 73 percent 
even with warm backing by the president and trustees matthews 
arrival at gettysburg in 1985 was not greeted with universal joy 
did i feel welcome hell no it was a challenge he told a 
visitor 
some in the faculty and administration were looking for a more 
radical guy he said some called the conservativelydressed 
softspoken matthews an uncle tom others wondered aloud why 
matthews and his ideas were worth scarce college dollars when they 
seemed geared to so few students 
but when the college spent 450000 to purchase the building that 
eventually housed the center it became clear to all that the 
center and matthews were here to stay 
matthews says he faced the same jolting transition that other 
black college students often find so trying he grew up in 
roosevelt long island a new york suburb where the public schools 
are mostly black he wanted to attend historically black fisk 
university but wound up at the mostly white state university of new 
york at oneonta where financial aid was more generous 
in 1977 the popularity of roots the book and television 
miniseries by alex haley sparked matthews passion for genealogy 
when roots came out i made a pledge to trace my family before 
i had children he said a vow he has kept 
eleven years of subsequent research led him to discover ancestors 
dating back to the american revolution he believes his oldest 
ancestor was a freedman known as isaac the african who served in the 
3rd regiment of south carolina 
the resource center will only be the starting point for such 
research however students wanting to delve deeply into their past 
will still have to go to the national archives in washington talk 
to relatives check state and county records of births retirement 
records marriage certificates and property deeds just as any 
genealogist would eventually matthews hopes the center will 
sponsor trips to archives in washington and elsewhere 
genealogy is especially formidable for blacks census data are 
only helpful back to 1870 its almost impossible for most blacks to 
discover their ancestral kunta kinte the character in roots 
captured in africa and brought to america on a slave ship 
what may be possible though difficult is to trace lineage 
before 1870 by studying white slaveholding families 
with black genealogy said matthews you just cant get around 
white folks its the only way

three times this decade police killings of unarmed 
blacks have triggered riots here but no officer has ever been 
convicted in those deaths and many blacks lack faith in law 
enforcements ability to police itself 
people are willing to endure unemployment and poor housing but 
they cannot endure being brutalized and shot for no reason said 
aleem fakir an organizer for people united to lead the struggle for 
equality 
in the latest disturbance three nights of violence followed the 
jan 16 shooting of black motorcyclist clement lloyd by miami police 
officer william lozano lloyds passenger allan blanchard died of 
injuries from the ensuing crash 
in the riots that followed one man was killed 13 buildings were 
burned and many businesses were looted 
a week after the shooting the colombianborn lozano was arrested 
and charged with two counts of manslaughter 
the speed with which he was charged was astonishing compared with 
previous cases so much so that lozanos attorney along with a 
colombian business group and the local police union president 
accused prosecutors of acting with unseemly haste to quiet the black 
community 
we did not look at any kind of pacification satisfaction 
said miami police chief perry anderson who is black we looked at 
what we had to do as professional law enforcement investigators 
to many blacks however the relatively mild charges and the low 
10000 bail for lozano seem like the familiar beginning of a 
recurring tragedy 
metrodade officers were acquitted in may 1980 of the beating 
death the previous december of black insurance agent arthur 
mcduffie sparking an uprising in which 18 people died in march 
1984 a hispanic miami policeman was acquitted of killing nevell 
johnson in a video arcade in december 1982 his death also caused 
disturbances although police moved quickly to stem protests after 
the verdict 
i just want to know why policemen have so many protection 
shields around them said the rev richard barry who heads a 
special review board empaneled by the city to investigate the latest 
case they have the fraternal order of police the policemans 
bill of rights and if they have that much protection how do you 
get to them 
barrys committee set up with much fanfare just as the riots 
subsided discovered at its first meeting that although the city 
commission gave it subpoena power state law and competing criminal 
investigations prevented key witnesses from testifying 
most investigations of police misconduct proceed at a glacial 
pace 
two cases that didnt involve black victims show the more 
leisurely pace of police abuse investigations 
one month before lloyd was shot in miamis black overtown 
section six members of miamis elite street narcotics squad were 
relieved of duty after allegedly beating an unarmed man to death in 
his home that investigation continues and no one has been charged 
a month before that a miami officers gun went off during a 
traffic stop killing the motorist no resolution has been reached 
in that case either 
while the police internal security division handles routine 
complaints state attorney janet renos office has responsibility 
for cases that may involve criminal charges 
her policy intended to depoliticize sensitive cases tends to 
drag out the process many blacks say it requires that charges 
against an officer be filed only after presentation of evidence in a 
special hearing before a judge 
if there is a question mark we take it to an inquest she 
said 
critics say there always seem to be question marks when police 
are involved 
the police get together and corroborate each others stories 
and grill independent witnesses looking for the smallest 
inconsistency its a whitewash said fakir 
he said some cases have stalled in the state attorneys office 
for up to two years in those cases where charges are brought the 
results have been less than satisfactory to blacks 
under a law popularly called the policemans bill of rights 
officers in conservative propolice florida can have representation 
at all levels of disciplinary hearings and complaints against them 
must be held confidential for 60 days 
miami police say they investigate every complaint as well as 
generating their own investigations twentynine policeman have been 
dismissed in the past four years said maj calvin ross newly 
appointed head of the internal security office 
twentyfive officers are on leave with pay routine procedure for 
officers who use their firearms or are accused of serious 
infractions most outstanding cases involve accusations of excessive 
force or extreme acts of abuse ross said 
in 1988 the department received 503 official complaints each of 
which can include more than one officer forty percent were deemed 
unfounded 24 percent substantiated and 36 percent inconclusive 
which ross admits is a frustrating category 
if theres a oneonone situation its very difficult to 
determine if the allegation occurred as the complainant said ross 
said that doesnt always sit just right with the complainant

one recent morning a newscast on france inter radio 
carried a story about le dumping by the japanese on european 
markets the newspaper liberation had a headline saying a top 
politician was in les starting blocks for coming elections in 
the afternoon un outsider won the days top horse race 
for years the french government has been battling the creeping 
invasion of english without much success every time a new french 
word is invented such as logiciel for computer software or 
cadreur for cameraman six new englishisms pop into the language 
couch potato has yet to gain currency in france but it cant 
be far away an article in le monde about american television 
introduced the term calling such a person une patate de canape 
most french profess to hate franglais on the other hand most 
use it from morning to night in newspapers on radio and in 
conversations one is bombarded with le marketing un 
challenge le sponsor un leader or un selfmademan 
successive governments have made fighting franglais their 
official policy creating a series of organizations to counter it 
the most recent is the commissariat general de la langue 
francaise which emerged in 1984 with the job of the defense of 
the french language the agency has just published the fifth 
edition of its dictionary of official neologisms 
the 2393 neologisms new french words in the book are 
mandatory for use in all ministries official correspondence and 
documents but getting the public to accept them is another matter 
the folks at the commissariat have no enforcement power usage not 
policy determines the success or failure of a word 
it is out of the question that we play the role of policing the 
language said bernard billaud the commissariats chief 
wordmaster our role is to raise consciousness 
many feel that the adoption of foreign words enriches a language 
within limits 
all languages borrow words billaud said it goes in the 
other direction too it is not so much a problem of borrowing words 
as it is a matter of naturalization of the word borrowed and the 
spirit of the word to make it really french 
fewer than 2500 official neologisms is not a particularly 
distinguished showing for nearly 20 years of work by the 
commissariat and its predecessors but wordmaking is a long process 
we have to consult specialists find a word perhaps consult 
with the academie francaise says billaud referring that oldest 
of the guardians of the language it was created by richelieu in 
1635 billaud also acknowledges that there are serious gaps in 
the dictionary 
englishspeakers are constantly amused by the struggle 
the commissariat has decreed that un bulldozer 
booldoezair will now be a bouteur journalists no longer get 
un scoop but an exclusivite pilots no longer work in un 
cockpit but in a habitacle 
officialdom also has zapped zapping the term used here for 
tvchannel jumping it has replaced it with sautechaine which 
literally means channeljump 
it has substituted tuiteur and boumeur for tweeters and 
woofers on stereo sets but try as it might it has never been able 
to get people to use agetac the french version of the acronym 
gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade and bande video 
promotionelle just doesnt beat un clip un clip refers to 
any promotional video especially music videos 
the word factory also has failed to come up with satisfactory 
replacements for le look when referring to image le stress 
for daytoday pressure le sandwich or un bluejean 
perhaps more unusual are english words that when absorbed into 
french lose their original meaning such as le forcing which 
is to apply pressure or un gadget which can even be applied to 
a government minister or program meaning something just for show 
the real irony is when english speakers steal a french term like 
savoir faire and the french retaliate by swiping knowhow 
the same can be said of rendezvous and meeting 
worst of all are the sweatshirts and imitation american high 
school jackets where the fashion is to have english words written 
on them no matter how nonsensical such as athletic sporting 
team or babie bear club then theres the sweatshirt that 
says scoop entrainement winter which has no meaning at all and 
is a spoof on the proliferation of english words on sweatshirts 
entrainement is french for training 
why this fascination with english 
much of the usage of english is snobbism said billaud 
speaking in french but slipping into an englishism snobbisme 
which has made its way into the french dictionary 
it takes a psychoanalysis of the french people who have always 
been impressed by what comes from the outside he added it is 
evidently a phenomenon resulting from the decline of france in the 
world since 1939 france is conscious its influence has diminished 
it is trying to find compensation english plays this role 
the french want to be modern and english is a sign of 
modernity

than 350 people were arrested in five states

were sites of demonstrations by groups that have been protesting 
regularly since last summer outside abortion clinics

in columbia sc and in fort wayne ind where about 350 
prochoice activists rallied across the street from more than 5000 
antiabortion demonstrators

teamsters leaders saturday rejected a 
government proposal to settle a racketeering suit that alleges 
mobsponsored corruption in the nations largest union and seeks to 
oust its top officials union sources said 
the decision came at a hastily arranged meeting in washington 
called by teamsters president william j mccarthy who on friday 
summoned the unions 16 vice presidents to discuss the settlement 
offer said one source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
we said no we rejected it said the source who declined to 
discuss the substance of the meeting 
thats right it was rejected said another participant in 
the meeting who agreed to confirm the outcome of the meeting on the 
condition he not be identified 
word of the decision came hours after one teamster leader who 
reportedly would have been forced out under the settlement announced 
his resignation a second union vice president also reportedly 
resigned saturday 
it is with deep regret that i leave this international union 
and especially its membership robert holmes second vice 
president of the teamsters said in a statement released by his 
union office in detroit 
holmes in his resignation statement said he wanted to spend 
more time with his family 
he also referred to a rift in the union leadership that has 
existed since mccarthy edged out teamsters secretarytreasurer 
weldon mathis last year in the race to succeed the late jackie 
presser as teamsters president 
the statement said the unwillingness of the unions governing 
board to effectuate the reforms proposed by holmes mathis and 
others have made his participation on the general executive board 
a continuing source of frustration 
the cleveland plain dealer quoting a union source reported in 
sunday editions that john h cleveland of washington also resigned 
his post as a teamsters vice president 
both holmes and cleveland were on the losing side last year when 
mccarthy then head of the teamsters in new england defeated 
mathis pressers handpicked successor in a 98 vote 
the unprecedented racketeering suit brought by the justice 
department maintains the 16million member teamsters unions 
leadership is rife with mobsponsored corruption 
the case is scheduled for trial feb 27 but us attorney 
rudolph giuliani who is resigning reportedly has proposed a 
settlement that calls for a number of internal union reforms and the 
resignations of several of the vice presidents 
the plain dealer which in its saturday editions first reported 
mccarthys calling the meeting quoted a teamsters source as saying 
giuliani was hot to trot to settle the suit before leaving 
office 
telephone calls to teamsters headquarters in washington on 
saturday went unanswered 
a third source speaking earlier saturday to the associated 
press said mccarthy called them together to talk it over to see 
how they feel about settling that source said he had no details 
of the proposed settlement and did not know whether all 16 vice 
presidents traveled to washington for the meeting 
the plain dealer said the proposal calls for direct elections of 
top teamsters officials with an independent panel named to oversee 
the process the officials now are elected at a convention of 
delegates a process law enforcement officials allege has been 
influenced at times by organized crime leaders 
the los angeles times reported last week that giuliani as part 
of a proposed settlement was demanding the resignations of five of 
the 16 international vice presidents the newspaper identified 
holmes as one of the five and said the other four are harold 
friedman of cleveland joseph trerotola of new york joseph morgan 
of hallandale fla and ted r cozza of pittsburgh 
spokeswoman deborah corley said giulianis office would neither 
confirm nor deny reports of a proposed settlement and had no further 
comment on the case 
in an interview published this month in the unions newsletter 
the international teamster mccarthy predicted the union would win 
the case 
every single member of the general executive board is committed 
to fighting the insulting accusations and personal attacks that have 
been leveled against us mccarthy was quoted as saying i know 
were going to win this because were right and right will triumph 
in the end 
the suit was filed seven months ago under the racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act it asks that the court 
oust the teamsters leadership and place the union under court 
trusteeship 
more than two dozen reputed organized crime figures were named as 
defendants in addition to the union thenpresident presser 16 
teamsters vice presidents and a former vice president two of the 
vice presidents named in the suit have since resigned mccarthy was 
third vice president when the suit was filed 
the suit contends that the alleged mob figures were aided and 
abetted by teamsters officials including mccarthy in controlling 
activities of the union through racketeering it lists convictions 
in teamsterrelated crimes dating back more than 25 years to support

two grandchildren of leon trotsky found each 
other after 57 years and the reunion eased a dark legacy of 
intrigue and violence that shaped their lives as surely as it did 
soviet history 
we were a little like two shipwrecked sailors who meet on a 
beach after a storm esteban volkow bronstein said in an interview 
after returning from a visit to his half sister alexandra 
zaharnovna in moscow 
they were parted by dictator josef stalins bloody purges and his 
bitter power struggle with trotsky a comrade of lenin in the 
bolshevik revolution who had commanded the red army 
stalin sent family members to exile prison camps or the grave 
he had trotsky exiled and his name expunged from soviet history 
books then killed at his modest home in mexico city by an assassin 
who used a mountaineers ice ax 
volkow 62 came to live with trotsky in the 1930s and didnt 
know alexandra was alive until he got a telephone call from french 
historian pierre broue in november broue who had just visited the 
soviet union said she was alive but ill 
volkow had seen her last in 1931 when he and their mother were 
expelled from the soviet union he had a friend write some phrases 
in russian and called her 
dearest sister he said into the crackling telephone your 
little brother esteban sends you an embrace a warm embrace i dont 
speak russian 
alexandra 65 and bedridden replied in a voice weakened by a 
long struggle with cancer 
she spoke with much emotion but i couldnt understand what she 
said he told the interviewer i kept reading the phrases 
talking and talking and repeating my phrases finally i said do 
svidania goodbye this was the call 
he went to the soviet embassy the next day and had a visa in 72 
hours weeks later he and his wife underwent what he described as 
an extremely meticulous clearance at customs in moscow 
maybe they thought we were subversives he said with a slight 
chuckle 
stalin accused trotsky of subversion when their power struggle 
began in the 1920s the assassin struck in 1940 when trotsky had 
been an exile for 11 years 
volkow was 14 and still remembers his beloved grandfather lying 
on the floor blood pouring from the ugly ax wounds in his head he 
keeps the house as a museum and the interview was conducted there 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of openness and 
reform a cautious reassessment of trotskys historical role has 
begun in the soviet union 
journalists and historians no longer call him a traitor to the 
revolution and a newspaper recently agreed with foreign historians 
that stalin had trotsky killed the soviet supreme court has 
rehabilitated his son sergei who was executed in a prison camp 
alexandra knew little about their grandfather and nothing of his 
murder in mexico volkow said 
there is no information on leon trotksy in the soviet union 
nothing nothing nothing he said when telling of the scrutiny 
customs officials gave an illustrated biography he was carrying for 
his sister 
broue the french historian found alexandra through a new moscow 
group called memorial that is compiling an archive on stalins 
millions of victims and hopes to erect monuments to them volkow 
said 
alexandra had taken the decision to emerge from her anonymity 
to publicly acknowledge her relation and her heritage only a few 
weeks earlier he said 
her brother said alexandra who had lost her parents and been 
reviled jailed and sent to internal exile because of her name told 
him she wasnt afraid of anything any longer not after all that 
had happened to her and her illness 
i hope she survives he said i want my daughters to know 
their aunt 
he met with members of memorial and thanked them for finding his 
only sister volkow said he was surprised and gratified to find 
trotsky and members of his family prominently featured in a mural of 
stalins victims in the groups office 
most of his five days in moscow was spent with his sister 
speaking through an interpreter and he discovered that memories of 
their parting haunted her as their grandfathers death haunted him 
she told me she remembered perfectly the departure when i left 
with our mother he said she always had a deep existential 
doubt why because our mother left with me not with her 
he said broue found the answer to that riddle of the day 
trotskys daughter zina abandoned one of her two children when 
stalin expelled my mother he allowed her to take only her youngest 
child volkow said 
alexandra left with her paternal grandmother eventually spent 
six months in jail and five years in internal exile she returned to 
moscow in 1954 after stalin died to study engineering marry bear 
a daughter and live in fearful anonymity 
her brother also an engineer went to live with trotsky after 
their mother committed suicide in paris his father platon volkow 
and alexandras zahar mobline died in stalins camps along with 
other members of the family 
volkow considers himself a mexican and found the soviet union to 
be like another planet 
the truth is that the country is really alien to me he said 
i left so young i have practically no memories no memories maybe 
just the beginning of winter the cold 
a visit to the house in moscow where his family had lived stirred 
little but a childhood recollection of cold light pouring through 
huge windows

john tower the defense 
secretarydesignate told nato strategists sunday they should remain 
skeptical of kremlin disarmament overtures and keep the wests 
nuclear options open 
the 16nation western alliance risks mortgaging its security if 
it fails to modernize its nuclear forces because of perceived 
improvements in the eastwest relationship he said 
under president mikhail s gorbachev the soviet union remains a 
powerful adversary with superior military capability and the west 
must not lose sight of that imbalance in its euphoria over 
disarmament prospects said tower 
if we fail to consider that capability or if we fail to 
consider its relevance in terms of their intentions then we do so 
at our peril said the texas republican selected to head the 
pentagon under president george bush 
in restating his support for extending the range of some 
europeanbased missiles tower joined other americans who used the 
annual allied defense strategy session to try and woo west europeans 
from their attraction to gorbachev and the concept that the east 
bloc now poses less of a threat 
the weekend conference highlighted the gap between us and 
european public opinion on defense needs west germans especially 
stake stronger hopes for disarmament on gorbachev and are opposed to 
anything considered an expansion of nuclear weapons in europe 
natos missile modification plan adopted in 1983 and referred to 
as modernization is so sensitive in west germany that the 
nations defense minister carefully avoided giving it open support 
in a speech saturday at the conference which is dominated by 
hardline supporters of modernization 
tower met privately with the minister rupert scholz on sunday 
but apparently failed to persuade him to show stronger support for 
nato doctrine 
we just illuminated some problems we didnt come to any 
solutions tower told the associated press 
he declined to say whether he was able to get an assurance from 
the west german that bonn would support modernization 
west germanys alleged involvement with a suspected poison gas 
plant in libya and its waning commitment to hosting nato troops 
aircraft and hardware were roundly criticized by americans at the 
conference on saturday 
sen john mccain rariz accused bonn of benign neglect in 
the libyan scandal and suggested senior officials have lied to hide 
their culpability 
on sunday the conference focused on new and mounting threats to 
alliance unity posed by gorbachevs charm offensive the broad 
public appeal generated by his array of proposals for disarmament 
and democratic reform 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner raised the concern voiced 
by many other influential defense strategists at the conference that 
gorbachev could fail and be replaced by a far more conservative 
leader 
we cannot entrust our security to one person alone or to 
intentions woerner said both can change overnight 
george younger the british defense secretary said in a speech 
that the west was being offered disarmament by the leader of the 
nation that has been arming and rearming for years 
despite west german concerns over lowlevel combat aircraft 
practices and other nato activity stirring public protest the 
allies appeared to agree that disarmament should proceed cautiously 
in the wake of the uncertain motives and prospects for kremlin 
reforms

dick frymires renowned rooster ted 
disgraced himself on national television when he predicted 
cincinnati to win the super bowl but hes not quitting and should 
have his picks for top 10 tv shows ready soon 
i tell everybody that ted is the most famous unfried chicken in 
the world today says frymire who has a regional radio show 
telling yarns about ted and offering folklore and advice on 
everything from getting rid of roaches and squirrels to calming a 
crying baby 
for the tv picks frymire will put the names of about 50 shows in 
front of ted and place a kernel of corn in front of each sign the 
first grain of corn ted eats will be his choice of the no 1 show 
with picks up to 10 
maybe thatll work out better than his superbowl prediction 
which was made on national television on cbs sunday morning 
it all started in 1984 when frymire put his pet into a pen shaded 
with two old campaign posters one of ronald reagan and the other of 
walter mondale he set out some numbers and corn kernels and asked 
ted how many states mondale would carry in the election 
ted ate the kernel in front of the number 1 
im the biggest democrat that ever was frymire said and i 
thought the chickens gone republican on me for sure 
since then ted has predicted winners of basketball games the 
kentucky derby and three super bowl games

the palestinian uprising has caused a recession 
in the occupied territories and slowed israels economic growth by 
forcing more military spending and scaring away tourists 
samir abdullah a palestinian economist says conditions could 
worsen as the palestinians continue to pursue their goal of ending 
21 years of israeli rule in the occupied lands 
dont think that money problems will bring the uprising to the 
end he said the palestinian people are tasting the results of 
their struggle 
thousands of arabs heeding the demands of the underground 
leaders of the 13month revolt and have quit jobs in israel 
boycotted israelimade goods and staged frequent general strikes in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
now the occupied lands are in a recession private analysts say 
abdullah said the lands gross national product the value of all 
goods and services shrank from 15 billion in 1987 to 12 billion 
in 1988 
for the 17 million palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip 
supporting the uprising has meant learning to live with less 
ziad a jewelry merchant in the arab market of jerusalems old 
city says his sales have fallen sharply in the past year because of 
strikes and the decline in tourists 
we dont earn enough to feed the family or even to replace the 
stock we do manage to sell said ziad who asked that his last 
name be withheld 
to cut expenses he has moved his six children from private to 
public schools there is no money for new clothes and he says he 
buys meat for the family maybe once a week 
ziad says he will continue to support the uprising until we 
free our homeland from the israelis 
even traditional arab hospitality characterized by heaping 
sweets and coffee upon visitors is being sacrificed 
slogans on the walls of several arab villages admonish one 
glass of water will satisfy a guest 
in israel the 35 billion economy grew a disappointing 1 percent 
in 1988 down from 5 percent a year earlier according to government 
statistics 
unemployment among israels 44 million people has risen from 56 
percent to more than 7 percent since the uprising started in 
december 1987 
at the same time the military is spending about 14 million a 
month for the thousands of reserve soldiers sent to the occupied 
lands to try to quell stonethrowing and other palestinian 
demonstrations the defense ministry says 
among the hardest hit industries is textile manufacturing which 
fell sharply last year because arab laborers quit their jobs 
according to a report by the industry ministry textile sales to the 
occupied territories dropped more than a third because of the 
palestinian boycott the report says 
a western economist who requested anonymity said onequarter of 
the 110000 palestinians who worked in israel before the uprising 
have quit their jobs 
the industry ministry reports that overall sales of israeli goods 
to the territories fell 70 percent last year to 140 million 
the nations tourist industry expected a big year in 1988 
israels 40th anniversary but only 13 million people visited a 14 
percent drop from 1987 
mordechai benari the tourism ministrys spokesman says the 
decline meant a loss of about 250 million in foreign exchange 
earnings 
in many hotels more than 70 percent of the rooms are empty and 
the israel hotel association has demanded lowinterest loans to keep 
afloat 
we cant keep on going this way indefinitely eli paposhado 
president of the association told a hoteliers convention last 
week the government must help us to keep afloat until there are 
better days 
but the government also is in trouble the uprising has only 
added to chronic problems such as inflation an overvalued currency 
and governmentrun industries that are finding it harder to compete 
in the world market

the senate bores ahead with confirmation 
proceedings on president bushs cabinet this week while the 
political imperative for most house members seems to be to stay out 
of sight and pocket a 45000 pay raise without a vote 
little or no major action is expected on the key issue facing 
congress reducing the federal deficit until after president bush 
presents his own proposals at a joint session of congress on feb 9 
in the meantime democratic officials say at least three and 
perhaps more cabinet appointees will come up for a vote in the 
senate this week and all are expected to win easy confirmation the 
list includes robert mosbacher as commerce secretary carla hills as 
trade representative and samuel skinner to run the transportation 
department 
votes also are possible this week on the appointments of manuel 
lujan as interior secretary and michael boskin to head the 
presidents council of economic advisers 
the timing is less certain for defense secretarydesignate john 
tower whose hearing will continue before the senate armed services 
committee on tuesday ed derwinski bushs choice to lead the 
department of veterans affairs has his confirmation hearing 
beginning on monday 
dr louis sullivan who has emerged as the most controversial 
cabinet appointee because of uncertainty over his views on abortion 
faces the senate finance committee at a confirmation wednesday on 
his appointment as secretary of health and human resources 
sullivan sought to reassure conservative republicans that he 
shares their opposition to abortion last week after he was quoted as 
having told one lawmaker that he does not favor overturning the 
supreme court decision that legalized the operations 
the senate confirmed three cabinet officials last week approving 
secretary of state james a baker iii labor secretary elizabeth 
dole and budget director richard darman on votes of 990 in 
addition treasury secretary nicholas brady attorney general 
richard thornburgh and education secretary lauro cavazos are 
holdover appointments from the reagan administration and do not 
require confirmation 
senate majority leader george mitchell while disclosing plans 
for confirmation votes this week has promised a vote on the pay 
raise but has not yet said when it will be 
congressional pay is scheduled to rise from 89500 a year to 
135000 a year beginning feb 8 unless both houses specifically 
reject the plan 
the senate is expected to vote against the raise in a roll call 
that will be almost entirely symbolic since democratic and 
republican house leaders have agreed not to allow the issue to come 
to the floor until after the pay raise takes effect on feb 8 their 
decision has drawn the protest of fewer than three dozen of the 435 
house members 
party leaders in both houses are working privately to draft 
provisions banning the practice of taking money for making speeches 
and other curtailments in congressional financial perks to offset 
the impact of the pay raise the possibilities include restricting 
the practice of taking vacations paid for by industry groups and 
others as well as stopping members of congress from converting 
leftover campaign funds to personal use when they retire 
both houses are holding hearings this week on two other key 
issues the faltering savings and loans industry and the flood of 
junkbondfinanced leveraged buyouts of major corporations 
in addition a special senate panel starts laying out the results 
of its yearlong investigation of alleged improprieties in federal 
indian programs 
the bush administration last week floated the idea of charging a 
fee of 25 cents on each 100 of deposits in sampls to help raise cash 
to close hundreds of insolvent institutions 
the proposal received a chilly reception on capitol hill and by 
weeks end both bush and federal home loan bank board chairman m 
danny wall were saying it was just one of several options being 
considered 
the taxwriting house ways and means committee will take its 
first hard look this year into the rapid pace at which some of the 
nations largest companies are loading themselves with debt in 
takeovers and defenses against them 
the aflcio last week called on the senate finance committee to 
eliminate or restrict the interest deductions on debtfinanced 
takeovers saying 90000 of its union members have lost their jobs 
this decade because of them

a key rival of prime minister benazir 
bhutto won a seat in the national assembly election results 
indicated sunday and he is expected to lead opposition forces in 
the legislature 
the official returns from the byelection saturday gave ghulam 
mustafi jatois conservative islamic democratic alliance seven seats 
in the assembly and ms bhuttos leftleaning peoples party four 
seats 
the victory for jatoi and his party came after a humiliating 
defeat in his home district of southern sind province in an election 
in november 
two other seats went to an independent and the candidate of a 
minor party 
lawmakers from ms bhuttos party and its allies still outnumber 
the nineparty moslem alliance by twotoone in the assembly or 
lower house parliament 
sundays results were not considered a defeat for ms bhutto 
because all the moslem alliances victories remained confined to the 
wealthy and populous punjab province where it emerged strongest in 
november when pakistan held its first free elections in 11 years 
the returns published by the pakistan election commission on 
sunday indicated that just under 50 percent of the 3 million 
eligible voters turned out for the byelection the same percentage 
as voted in november 
at stake were 13 seats in the 237seat national assembly and 
seven seats in provincial assemblies of districts where candidates 
in november won more than one seat or where the vote was postponed 
because a candidate died 
in the provincial contests the two leading parties won three 
seats each and an independent won one 
chief election commissioner sa nusrat said voting was calm and 
peaceful except for in one district of lahore the punjab capital 
where police had to break up a stonethrowing melee between rival 
supporters of ms bhutto and jatoi nusrat said the disturbance did 
not disrupt voting 
sundays results reflected novembers voting pattern 
ms bhuttos party emerged the strongest nationwide but fell 
short of an outright majority the moslem alliance which includes 
proteges of the late military dictator mohammad zia ulhaq 
established a power base in punjab where it now controls the 
provincial legislature 
zia died in a plane crash in august clearing the way for ms 
bhutto and her allies to assume power zia overthrew ms bhuttos 
father prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto in a bloodless 1977 coup 
and ordered him hanged two years later on conviction of conspiring 
to murder a political opponent 
jatoi was a minister in ms bhuttos cabinet and was jailed for 
15 months for his opposition to zias rule 
he remained with the pakistan peoples party until ms bhutto 
returned home from selfimposed exile in europe in 1986 to head the 
party 
jatoi opposed ms bhuttos leadership and the governing of a 
moslem nation by a woman he broke away from the party to form his 
national peoples party 
when the new members of the national assembly take their seats 
jatoi is expected to be the floor leader for the islamic democratic 
alliance forces

as congress ponders a recommendation to close 
86 smaller military facilities the army is preparing to buy 200000 
acres adjacent to its main training area to accommodate modern 
tanks planes and electronic gear that need more and more room for 
largescale maneuvers 
army officials say they need 29 million to expand the national 
training center at fort irwin next to death valley in california 
by comparison the base alignments and closing commission has said 
693 million can be saved annually by shutting the facilities it 
recommended 
outgoing defense secretary frank c carlucci has already sent the 
commissions recommendations on base closings to congress which 
take effect unless blocked by both houses senior lawmakers say 
rejection of the package is unlikely 
likewise congress has not objected to the armys plans to buy 
200000 acres adjacent to the 632000acre fort irwin 
the expansion conforms with the commissions expression of 
acute concern about the requirement of the armed forces for 
adequate training areas 
none of the bases recommended for closing were large enough for 
largescale maneuvers said paul w johnson deputy assistant army 
secretary for installations and housing 
in addition to buying land at fort irwin johnson said the army 
is considering a 63000acre expansion of a training facility at 
yakima wash and needs yet another major training center of at 
least 600000 acres 
current budget requests do not contain money for acquiring the 
second major training facility which likely would be a joint 
project by the air force and the army johnson said in an interview 
its not in the fiveyear plan yet he said 
two problems cited repeatedly by pentagon and commission 
officials are that bases established in remote areas during world 
war ii are now surrounded by dense populations and that the 
services require more land to train with increasingly faster more 
powerful and more sophisticated weaponry 
the increasing sophistication and extended ranges of modern 
weapons continually increase the requirements for training areas 
said the commission report issued last month 
the five nautical miles required by a world war ii fighter 
aircraft for aerial maneuver have grown to 40 miles today the 
report said that range will extend to 100 miles as the services 
introduce the next generation of fighters over the next decade it 
said 
similarly an army mechanized battalion needs more than 80000 
acres to practice standard maneuvers its world war ii predecessor 
required fewer than 4000 it said 
for army brigades consisting of two or more battalions fort 
irwin is the only base large enough to train with high speed m1 
abrams tanks and bradley fighting vehicles said johnson 
while the torrid desert conditions at fort irwin provide good 
training for the middle east and southwest asia said army spokesman 
lt col robert millard it is not ideal for troops practicing to do 
battle in europe 
ideally the land should resemble the terrain you intend to 
fight on said millard interviewed jointly with johnson 
the need for maneuvering room seems to have crept up on army in 
the 1960s and 1970s in 1971 the army turned fort irwin over to 
the national guard realizing the need for open spaces the army 
reclaimed fort irwin in 1981 and now counts it among its key 
facilities around the globe 
the need for bigger training spaces also affects other major 
powers 
the commission notes in passing that soviet forces have at 
their disposal vast training areas in which to practice largeunit 
maneuvers the base closing report said 
great britain and west germany train in the vast expanses of 
canada said capt don roy a spokesman for the canadian military 
britain and west germany keep permanent detachments of tanks at 
suffield alberta on the canadian plains and they stage air 
maneuvers at goose bay labrador which has huge flying ranges that 
are onethird the size of the whole of west germany 
us army officials said they have not discussed with the 
canadian government the possibility of joint maneuvers in canada 
while its ships obviously do not have space constraints at sea 
the navy tried to solve maneuvering problems faced by its landbased 
pilots by purchasing a huge tract at the lemoore naval air station 
in the san joaquin valley of california in the 1950s said retired 
adm wesley mcdonald a former deputy chief of naval operations for 
aviation 
lemoore opened july 8 1961 on an alkaline patch surrounded by 
farmland 45 miles south of fresno said base spokesman dennis 
mcgrath

intense interest in revamping and expanding 
college humanities requirements has translated into little success 
in the past five years according to a study released sunday 
the study sponsored by the national endowment for the humanities 
found that students are only slightly more likely to have to take 
such courses in order to graduate and it is possible to bypass many 
significant fields of knowledge en route to a degree 
general requirements in the humanities area rose an average of 
15 hours from 198384 to 198889 a 62 percent increase 
according to the study of course requirements at 496 colleges and 
universities 
average increases in requirements for english and american 
literature foreign languages and literature history and philosophy 
all totaled 2 credit hours or less over the fiveyear period 
one would have hoped that all the concern about curriculum 
reform would have resulted in more said endowment chairwoman 
lynne cheney 
theres been such emphasis and such effort in the past five 
years to try to restore form and substance to undergraduate 
requirements she said in an interview last week i dont mean 
to suggest at all that colleges are not trying what this survey 
shows is how hard it is 
mrs cheney attributed some of the problems to outside 
pressures and heavy course requirements for certain majors 
for example she said music school accrediting agencies require 
that 65 percent of all course work be subjects related to music 
that makes it very hard to carve out the time she said and 
the requirements in engineering are so heavy that its very 
difficult for an engineering student to find time for humanities 
requirements 
mrs cheney said the one bright spot in the survey is that the 
number of schools letting students choose from a virtually unlimited 
list of courses has decreased only 13 percent of schools allow 
students to choose from unlimited course offerings down from 19 
percent five years ago 
thats a big drop she said the structure is tightening 
up when youve got a situation where students are told take three 
of the following and they can choose from 620 courses theyre 
going to miss major areas of human knowledge 
currently mrs cheney said it is possible to earn a bachelors 
degree from 38 percent of colleges and universities without taking 
any course in history 45 percent without taking a course in english 
or american literature 62 percent without taking a philosophy 
course and 77 percent without studying a foreign language 
the neh study found that requirements in math and the sciences 
were increased by a greater number of hours than those for 
humanities 
for example math requirements rose from two to 25 hours from 
1983 to 1988 a 24 percent hike natural sciences and social science 
requirements each climbed an average of 04 hours for increases of 
103 percent and 73 percent respectively 
mrs cheney said the higher increases in math and science do not 
necessarily reflect college priorities because there were so few 
requirements in that area to begin with for example the two hours 
in math in 1983 compared to 235 hours that year in general 
humanities including 45 hours of english composition 
the math and science requirements are welcome in any case she 
said because there are at least as many people who major in the 
humanities who do not have sufficient literacy in science and math 
as there are people who are engineering majors who dont know about 
the humanities it is a twosided problem

political action committees affiliated with 
chicago futures markets have donated millions of dollars to the 
election campaigns of officials who oversee regulation of the 
exchanges which are now targets of a federal investigation a 
newspaper reported sunday 
the auction markets political action committee which represents 
the chicago board of trade and the commodity futures political 
fund representing the chicago mercantile exchange have funded the 
campaigns of lawmakers on congressional committees regulating 
futures markets the chicago tribune said 
the two exchanges are being investigated by federal officials who 
suspect widespread fraud in trading practices 
authorities refuse to comment but the investigation reportedly 
centers on allegations that as many as 100 brokers and traders 
systematically cheated customers in illegal trades 
some commodities experts say the investigation could bring about 
new government regulations which traders oppose 
the worst result would be that it would cast a shadow over the 
entire industry and we wind up facing regulatory proposals 
said alan j brody president of new yorks commodity exchange 
the tribune reported that traders donated 14 million to the two 
pacs linked to the chicago markets during the 198788 election cycle 
of that amount 856750 was donated to congressional campaigns 
up sharply from the 535100 the pacs donated in the 198586 cycle 
the newspaper said 
the contributions included some hefty gifts to lawmakers who have 
introduced bills that would benefit the commodities industries the 
tribune said 
in 1984 the two groups gave 21000 to campaign america a pac 
set up by sen robert dole rkan individual traders also donated 
49500 to doles pac the tribune said 
dole then chairman of the senate finance committee helped to 
work out a special tax bailout to save traders about 300 million 
annually the paper reported 
dole spokesman walt riker reached sunday at his springfield 
va home denied the senator had been influenced by the donations 
pac contributions have absolutely no relation to how a member 
votes and to say otherwise is garbage riker said at least 
speaking for senator dole i know that thats true 
rep martin russo dill received 38850 from the two pacs and 
other sources related to the commodities industry in the 198182 
election cycle and an additional 25000 in 198384 the newspaper 
said 
in 1981 russo sponsored a measure that would have closed a tax 
loophole for everyone except traders leaving them with a savings of 
as much as 400 million annually according to common cause a 
citizens interest group in washington 
the bill did not pass and russo has denied he was influenced by 
the contributions he has not been accused of any illegality the 
newspaper said 
in 1984 the pacs contributed 20000 to the reelection campaign 
of sen jesse helms rnc who was then head of the senate 
agriculture committee which is one of the panels that oversees the 
commodities industry the newspaper said 
calls to the congressional offices and residences of russo and 
helms were not answered sunday

three and a half years after his capture by an 
angry mob the defendant in the night stalker case begins trial 
monday charged in the satanic serial slayings of 13 people that 
terrorized california in 1985 
even for sensational serial murder trials this one will have 
unusual security for the unpredictable defendant richard ramirez 
who once yelled hail satan and flashed a demonic symbol in 
court ramirez has been more subdued recently and taken to wearing 
black clothing and sunglasses which he uses to peer at the crowd 
trials here in recent years have included the hillside 
strangler case of angelo buono jr convicted of the sex slayings 
of nine young women and girls and the case of william bonin 
convicted of the freeway killer sex murders of 10 young men 
but ramirez will wear leg shackles while seated in court and 
spectators entering the courtroom will have to pass through a metal 
detector 
the precautions were put into effect last august when the lead 
prosecutor deputy district attorney philip halpin claimed ramirez 
had threatened to kill him in court with a smuggled gun then turn it 
on spectators 
defense attorney daniel hernandez denied the threat but the los 
angeles county sheriffs department said threats indeed had been 
made and established the strong security 
ramirez 28 a pale shaggyhaired drifter from el paso texas 
is charged with 13 counts of murder and 30 other felonies including 
rape robbery and attempted murder he could receive the death 
penalty if convicted 
the charges stem from a 1985 summer crime spree in which a 
nocturnal killer dubbed the night stalker entered homes through 
unlocked windows or doors raped women killed both men and women 
with executionstyle gunshot blasts to the head and stole jewelry 
and other valuables 
prosecutors are anxious to begin testimony in the muchdelayed 
trial which officially began with jury selection in july 
attorneys opening statements are set for monday morning 
the entire trial before superior court judge michael tynan is 
expected to take two years 
the most recent delay was caused by a controversy over the racial 
makeup of the jury the defense accused prosecutors of excluding 
hispanics and black women while the prosecution accused the defense 
of excluding whites and asians 
a 12member jury of seven women and five men comprised of six 
blacks and six hispanics was finally chosen last week there are 
also 12 alternates 
another late development was a report thursday that a state 
appellate court ruled that ramirezs lawyer hernandez failed to 
meet professional standards in a previous murder case the appellate 
court said hernandez failed to adequately interview and subpoena 
witnesses and failed to research the law among other things 
concerns by judges and prosecutors about hernandezs competence 
to represent ramirez in the complex capital murder case have 
surfaced several times but he remains as counsel 
while the slayings were going on fear swept the city gun sales 
and selfdefense classes increased citizens shut their doors and 
windows tight despite a 100degree heat wave the terror spread as 
the crimes moved north to san francisco and south to orange county 
ramirez also is charged in both areas 
one victims eyes were gouged out several women testified at 
ramirezs preliminary hearing in 1986 that after the killer murdered 
their husbands they were raped and ordered to swear to satan 
the killer often scrawled on walls drawings of pentagrams 
inverted fivepointed stars commonly associated with devil worship 
during his 1985 arraignment ramirez fueled speculation that he 
was indeed a devil worshiper when he yelled hail satan and 
flashed a pentagrammed palm in court 
he was arrested after he was chased and beaten by an angry east 
los angeles mob during the 1985 labor day weekend when he allegedly 
tried to steal a car the same day his picture appeared in 
newspapers as the prime suspect in the crime spree

as haunting as he was in life ted bundy is 
proving even more enigmatic in death as homicide investigators and 
the families of murder victims wonder what secrets the serial killer 
took to the electric chair 
in the four days before he was put to death tuesday for the 1978 
rape and murder of a 12yearold florida girl bundy confessed to 23 
murders in the 1970s in utah colorado idaho and washington 
including some in which he was not a suspect or that investigators 
were unable to match to any known slayings 
across the country prosecutors and detectives took another look 
at unsolved cases as word spread that investigators talking to bundy 
at the florida state prison believed he may have murdered 100 young 
women 
even the denials he gave me when i brought up certain cases 
were just not bundytype denials said robert keppel a washington 
state attorney generals investigator who probed eight socalled 
ted killings for 15 years bundy confessed to those slayings and 
others before his execution but there are several other murders in 
washington that keppel wonders about 
they the denials led me to think he was a suspect said 
keppel 
keppel whom bundy invited to florida for his 11thhour 
confessions believes his long involvement with the serial killer 
has helped him detect changes in bundys mood and speech that tipped 
him off when bundy was lying 
it was keppel who suggested bundy might be responsible for more 
than 100 slayings 
the fbi said last week that it is planning a meeting in february 
of law enforcement agencies that suspect bundy may be responsible 
for unsolved homicides in their states 
terry green a major case specialist with the bureaus violent 
criminal apprehension effort in quantico va where the meeting 
will be held said the idea is to get investigators in one place 
so we can discuss the peculiarities in each case 
in addition to the slaying of the florida girl bundy had been 
convicted of murdering two sorority sisters at florida state 
university in 1978 
bundys name has surfaced as a possible suspect in slayings in 
burlington vt where he was born in 1946 in pennsylvania and new 
jersey during the time bundy was a student at temple university in 
philadelphia and throughout the west 
in utah salt lake county sheriffs lt ben forbes said 
investigators have looked at unsolved cases since bundy confessed to 
killing eight women and girls in the state but forbes said he 
doesnt know whether there might be more victims 
we have researched now with our state medical examiner any 
jane does back to the 1970s there were only four or five and none 
appear to be his work forbes said 
in vermont burlington police detective thomas tremblay said 
bundy is not a suspect in a 1971 murder and rape we have no 
evidence or information that links him to the scene of our 
homicide he said 
the connection was a bit stronger in new jersey where two 
19yearold women were stabbed to death on memorial day 1969 arthur 
norman a forensic psychologist who interviewed bundy for his 
defense telephoned atlantic county nj prosecutor jeffrey blitz 
shortly after the execution to say bundy had confessed to those 
murders 
blitz said the information from norman wasnt satisfying as a 
serious link to bundy but the case is being looked at again 
bundy said while he was attending temple he went to the jersey 
shore picked up two girls blitz said norman came to the 
conclusion that he killed these two girls bundy never admitted it 
it was based on normans conclusions 
in his confessions bundy specifically denied committing any 
murders in vermont or new jersey 
keppel suspects that bundy who was 42 when he was put to death 
began his murderous ways when he was 14 and living in tacoma wash 
even though bundy denied involvement in the 1961 disappearance and 
presumed murder of ann marie burr who was 8 when she was abducted 
from her bedroom 
he said he was too young he lived too far away those were 
pretty weak excuses said keppel who added he had interviewed 
bundy enough to develop a sense of when bundy was being evasive or 
misleading 
like keppel beverly burr still suspects bundy in the death of 
her daughter 
i wrote to him bundy and he emphasized he was a normal 
14yearold boy that he didnt live near us and didnt roam around 
at night i know thats not true she said as far as we know he 
was not a normal 14yearold boy but right now there just isnt 
much i can do

white house chief of staff john sununu declared 
sunday that positioning to deal with eventual failure by 
some members of congress could wreck efforts to reach a bipartisan 
budget agreement 
if thats the additude going in then none of us will 
succeed sununu said in a broadcast interview 
sununu also said a proposal for a fee on deposits to help shore 
up ailing savings and loans remains a live option despite 
widespread congressional and industry opposition to the plan 
there are a variety of options being examined sununu said on 
abcs this week with david brinkley 
he said opponents of the proposed fee were able to take the 
lead and put the worst foot forward on the plan after the bush 
administration made a goodfaith effort at early consulations with 
house and senate leaders 
i guess the most disappointing part of the whole thing is the 
effort that was being made to get the congress early enough to let 
them be apart of crafting alternatives resulted in a firestorm on 
one alternative that was not necessarily the leading candidate 
sununu said 
the savings and loan proposal would call for a fee of about 250 
for every 1000 deposited in federally insured savings and loans 
and commercial banks 
disclosure that the treasury department was considering such a 
plan complicated bushs otherwise harmonious first week in office 
while repeating bushs assertion friday that the plan had not yet 
reached the white house sununu noted that financial institutions 
have long paid a fee for federal deposit insurance 
he said the plan under study was simply a matter of taking the 
current fee and adjusting it to affect the reality 
if financial institutions were to pass along such an increased 
fee directly to depositers american savers still would be getting a 
bargain for having their savings insured by their government he 
said 
sununu said bush still intends to work with congress on forging 
bipartisan solutions on both the savings and loan and the larger 
budget crises 
were looking for the democrat congress to be part of 
developing a solution he said and any concern we have is 
the different slices of congress positioning itself to deal with 
evenutal failure 
interviewed on the same program sen ernest hollings dsc 
and rep william gray iii dpa both voiced skepticism over bushs 
announced intention to produce a budget by feb 9 that meets 
deficitreduction targets without new taxes 
hollings charirman of the senate commerce committee said the 
administration was glossing over the deficit problem with 
toooptimistic economic assumptions 
and gray said the president had put himself in a box with his 
nonewtaxes pledge but should relent and vow support of between 
13 billion and 14 billion in new revenues 
gray is immediate past chairman of the house budget committee a 
rotating assignment and a member of the house democratic leadership 
sununu asked about the remarks of hollings and gray said 
both the senator and the congressman appeared to be positioning in 
case theres a failure this adminstration is committed to 
moving to a success 
sen lloyd bentsen dtex chairman of the senate finance 
committee also voiced skepticism about the nonewtaxes pledge in 
an interview on nbcs meet the press 
i think the odds are against him on that one bentsen said 
when asked about bushs chances of bringing the budget deficit down 
to 100 billion without raising taxes 
bentsen also criticized the proposed fee on savings deposits 
saying that trial balloon of putting a tax on deposits was really 
very foolish

travelers who dont want to see the sights 
alone can find a friend through travel buddy which provides 
companions who will accompany anyone any age to anywhere in the 
world 
since dona m risdall began operating travel buddy out of her 
home in suburban bloomington in 1987 the service has provided 
buddies for more than 100 travelers in the united states and 
overseas the buddies who are carefully screened get their tickets 
paid by the clients but pay other expenses 
i think they relax a lot more when theyre on a trip with a 
buddy i think its extra security ms risdall said i call it 
travel buddy because thats what they are a really good buddy to 
the client 
among ms risdalls clients are the elderly the slightly 
handicapped and small children the youngest were a couple of girls 
ages 6 and 7 who flew with a buddy to visit their father in texas 
theres a lot of early retirees that have the money but have no 
one to go with ms risdall said 
she got the idea for the service at her job as a frontdesk 
assistant at an athletic club in bloomington 
just time and time again i heard so many say my wife or 
husband has passed away and theyd love to travel but they dont 
want to go alone she said 
ms risdall 49 started her business with about 5000 which 
was used mostly for printing and mailing brochures 
for a fee 65 for nonmembers 45 for members risdall lines 
up a traveler with a buddy of similar background and interests the 
annual membership fee is 25 and travelers either can make their 
own travel arrangements or ms risdall will make them through a 
travel agent she works with 
ms risdall screens all prospective buddies and requires 
references she said she has about 50 men and women of all ages in 
her listings 
this month ms risdall began a branch operation in dallas out of 
a former buddys home and shes thinking about a similar branch in 
arizona 
there are other organizations that provide companions for 
disabled travelers said peter shawlawrence of the new york 
citybased society for the advancement of travel for the handicapped 
each of these organizations may have slightly different 
things he said 
a getacquainted session is arranged between the traveler and the 
prospective buddy if both are from around minneapolis if the client 
lives out of state ms risdall chooses the buddy 
agatha drilling 70 of cedar rapids iowa contacted travel 
buddy after reading a magazine article about the service she was 
lined up with a companion who drove with her to phoenix in december 
i think its great said ms drilling who plans to use the 
service again you get somebody who you can feel is trustworthy 
because they were checked out 
her buddy natalie kirstiuk 40 of fridley said she applied 
to be a buddy because she loves to travel 
it was a chance to see more of the country that i havent 
seen she said 
ms risdall has provided buddies for travelers going to europe 
and australia but the trip can be as short as to north dakota 
ms risdall whose friends tease her for being a workaholic 
hasnt taken a vacation herself for years when a trip to hawaii 
comes along im going to go she said

days near a bahamian island navy officials said sunday 
the ship based in mayport ran aground wednesday off andros 
island 150 miles southeast of miami during a routine training 
operation 
it took the combination of two successive high tides and the 
steady tugging of two other ships to free the destroyer said lt 
cmdr tim taylor of the mayport naval station 
the uss grasp was really the main player in this drama 
taylor said the salvage ship and the usns mohawk an oceangoing 
tug pulled the 563foot spruance free shortly before midnight 
saturday 
navy divers inspected spruances hull sunday they confirmed 
the hull is intact taylor said 
but he added that the propellers had been damaged so the grasp is

a quarterfinal contest for the world chess 
championship candidates series resumes monday after a firstmatch 
draw between former world champion anatoly karpov of the soviet 
union and icelands johann hjartarson 
the winner of the candidates series of matches will challenge 
world champion garri kasparov for his world title in 1990 
hjartarson 25 playing white offered the draw after 15 moves 
saturday and karpov 37 accepted 
the match is only six games and karpov must be cautious in 
settling for a draw because just one win by hjartarson would put the 
icelandic grandmaster in a very strong position one chess analyst 
said 
chess analysts said the key to saturdays game described as the 
doubly delayed exchange variation of the ruy lopez was hjartarsons 
11th move when he moved his knight to queenbishop 4 positionally 
making continuation of the game questionable 
one analyst said hjartarson played not so much to win but to 
keep from losing to the 11time world champion 
three quarterfinals matches are under way or about to begin the 
fourth was won by british grandmaster jonathan speelman who 
advanced to the semifinals

no arrests have been made but revenge is a 
strong candidate as motive in the killing nearly two weeks ago of 
the head of oregons prison system a man who had received death 
threats 
michael francke 42 formerly a law enforcement official in new 
mexico was stabbed in the heart the evening of jan 17 during an 
attack in a parking lot outside the corrections department office 
police wont divulge many details about the crime such as any 
injuries francke may have suffered besides the fatal stab wound 
you need to have something that only you know and the murderer 
knows to use for corroboration said marion county district 
attorney dale penn whos leading the investigation 
according to published reports francke apparently stumbled 25 
yards from the parking lot to the building where he broke a glass 
pane in a door before collapsing 
lateworking colleagues searched for francke after finding his 
car one door ajar in the parking lot 
a guard found his body was found at the rarely used entry no 
weapon was found 
robbery hasnt been ruled out as a motive but penn said 
investigators are pursuing the possibility that franckes death was 
a revenge killing 
francke served as a prosecutor judge and head of corrections in 
new mexico before being hired in may 1987 to take charge of oregons 
severely overcrowded prison system 
he no doubt made enemies in both states investigators have said 
this could be random street violence a regular old strongarm 
robbery penn said but it also could be a complicated 
conspiracy because of the positions that he has held in the two 
states 
it is a very difficult case just because of his background 
former state rep chuck sides a friend of franckes said the 
corrections chief had shown him a letter threatening his life last 
fall he said he could remember no details of the letter which 
francke had shrugged off 
sides said francke had told him he was glad to have left the new 
mexico correction department because of death threats there 
but sides also francke made comments about death by stabbing 
several weeks ago 
i cant remember what brought it up but he told me exactly how 
a person would die with a stab through the heart sides said 
basically he showed me with his own hand how you would do that 
franckes brother patrick francke jr said he doesnt believe 
robbery was a motive 
in an interview from his home in kansas city mo patrick 
francke said police appear to have recovered all his brothers 
personal effects including a wallet credit cards and car keys 
he also said he cant understand why a robber would single out 
his brother who was 6foot3 and weighed more than 200 pounds as a 
target 
penn said he can understand the brothers point of view but 
insisted that robbery is still a viable motive 
the district attorney last week gave out a sketchy description of 
a man who is believed to have stabbed francke penn said the man had 
dark hair and was wearing dark pants and a light coat 
at the same time the district attorney said police arent 
getting close to making an arrest in the case 
it was a quick event and the person escaped he said you 
generally need to get a break in this kind of case a tip from the 
public or somebody talking

vice president dan quayle embarking on the 
bush administrations first diplomatic mission will be under a 
microscope this week as the world watches for policy signals from 
the new white house and evaluates how quayle handles his first major 
assignment 
the new vice presidents trip to venezuela and el salvador will 
be his first chance to perform on the international stage since his 
elevation from junior senator from indiana 
twentytwo heads of states are expected to be with quayle in 
caracas on thursday for the inauguration of carlos andres perez as 
president 
the lineup is expected to include presidents of the five central 
american countries and of the principle latin debtor nations 
together they could present a uniform front on the question of how 
the poor nations will handle their huge international debts 
quayle is expected to conduct bilateral meetings with about 10 of 
the presidents including at least one or two from central america 
and up to five from south america said an administration official 
close to the planning of quayles trip 
among those expected to be present he will not meet with cubas 
fidel castro and nicaraguas daniel ortega 
also expected for the inauguration are alfredo cesar and other 
representatives of the usbacked contra rebels who are hoping to 
push the other central american presidents to demand democratization 
in nicaragua 
venezuelas biggest inauguration ever will mostly present a 
protocol challenge for quayle said a us official 
how he presents himself and the style with which he represents 
the united states will be as much a measure of his success as 
anything said the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
it is important symbolically in that it is one of the more 
important meetings of latin american leaders in the last 10 years 
the official said 
quayle whose chief legislative accomplishment was a jobtraining 
bill has been closeted in hours of briefings with state department 
and national security council officials and others familiar with the 
region 
he was described by one of the briefers as energetic and eager to 
carry out the trip with accomplishment 
among those with whom he has met are aflcio officials who are 
concerned about human rights in el salvador said quayles press 
secretary david beckwith 
in el salvador he will meet with outgoing president jose 
napoleon duarte and with other political and military figures 
including representatives of duartes christian democratic party and 
the rightist republican nationalist alliance or arena party 
el salvador in the stranglehold of a guerrilla war against the 
usbacked government for the past nine years holds elections 
march 19 duarte cannot run again and arenas alfredo cristiani led 
christian democratic candidate fidel chavez mena in recent polls 
some us officials have expressed concern that a victory by 
cristiani could further polarize the wartorn country and create 
stumbling blocks in congress for getting new aid to the region 
passed 
quayles el salvador visit comes at a volatile time duarte 
recently rejected a proposal by the rebels in which the rebels 
offered to take part in the elections and drop their longstanding 
demand for power sharing in a transitional government if the 
elections were postponed to september 
officials said no diplomatic breakthroughs would be expected of 
quayle but that his mission would be to show bush administration 
concern for the regions economic and social problems 
the trip is mainly to show our interest in the area and show 
our interest in democracy said beckwith 
it is also a chance for quayle to meet the challenge of critics 
who during the presidential campaign claimed he was not up to the 
job of vice president 
quayle is not scheduled to make any speeches during the trip but 
will hold press conferences 
beyond quayles personal performance the trip puts a spotlight 
on latin america as a region the bush administration considers 
important and world leaders will be watching to see what they can 
expect in the way of policy from bush 
theyre all waiting with baited breath to see what signals he 
will send on such issues as the debt crisis and the contra war in 
nicaragua said one administration official 
riddled by massive debt and internal economic disarray many of 
the latin countries are also plagued by insurgent movements 
among them rebel forces have been entrenched in el salvador and 
guatemala for years while guerrilla activity by the radical shining 
path in peru also has stepped up 
latin american countries owe more than 440 billion of the 13 
trillion of third world debt brazil mexico and argentina are the 
biggest third world debtors with much of the money owed to us 
banks 
perez along with mexicos president carlos salinas de gotari 
have been in the forefront of urging relief from the debt burden 
that has resulted in net payments of 20 billion to 30 billion a 
year from poor countries to richer ones 
but no definitive policy on central american debt or the contra 
war has been outlined by the bush administration 
secretary of state james a baker iii as treasury secretary in 
1985 proposed 29 billion in new loans to third world countries 
that demonstrate economic reform but banks did not embrace the 
proposal and not much came of it 
baker said during his recent senate confirmation hearing that the 
bush administration will undertake a full review of the debt 
situation 
baker also signalled the bush administrations leanings on 
nicaragua vowing support for the contras and calling for a 
bipartisan central american policy he called for human rights 
protection in nicaragua as well as el salvador and other countries 
in the region 
the central american presidents are expected to emerge from 
caracas with a date to resume their talks to further the regional 
peace plan offered by costa rican president oscar arias

a senate committee begins hearings this week to 
lay out the results of an investigation of alleged improprieties in 
federal indian programs a yearlong 600witness inquiry that panel 
leaders say could lead to criminal prosecutions 
the allegations of corruption fraud and waste in federal indian 
programs were aired initially in a series of articles by the arizona 
republic 
all evidence of criminal wrongdoing will be handed over to the 
justice department said sen dennis deconcini dariz head of the 
special committee formed in october 1987 following the newspaper 
articles 
sen tom daschle dsd and sen john mccain rariz also are 
on the committee 
deconcini and mccain told the republics washington bureau the 
initial two weeks of hearings will bring to a close the inquirys 
first phase 
after initial testimony on the us government treatys 
obligations to indians the first week of hearings will be dominated 
by examples of abuses and fraud in federal programs designed to 
encourage the government to contract with indianowned firms for 
construction projects on reservations and for providing supplies to 
indians deconcini said 
owners of companies have offered bribes of cars trips and money 
to indian leaders and small business administration officials to win 
contracts deconcini said 
deconcini declined to provide specifics saying they would be 
disclosed during the hearings 
a second round of hearings slated to begin this spring will 
investigate fraud in indianresource programs 
senate investigators have found that large companies bilked 
taxpayers and indians of undisclosed amounts by outright theft of 
resources and by underpaying royalties for oil gas minerals and 
timber from indian lands deconcini said 
but he said investigators have not yet uncovered what the 
republics series reported was billions of dollars in theft of 
resources or underreporting of production volumes done to lower 
royalty payments 
deconcini said the ongoing resources inquiry has been slowed by 
shoddy record keeping by the interior department of which the 
bureau of indian affairs is a part 
he said record keeping is so lax investigators have been forced 
to piece together contracts and production levels by crosschecking 
them with documents at resource companies and associations 
deconcini and mccain stressed that corruption is not the central 
focus of the investigation 
we want to highlight the problems for american people who 
dont know or dont care about a significant portion of the 
population which lives under vastly different conditions than the 
majority of other americans mccain said 
mccain discussing allegations of child abuse at indian schools 
said senate investigators will show that federal officials 
repeatedly fail to make even cursory background checks of 
prospective teachers the senate inquiry also found that indian 
affairs officials have resisted investigating charges of abuse he 
said 
deconcini said investigators also have solid evidence that 
organized crime figures have infiltrated indian gaming operations 
using coercion and a heavy hand 
the bingo area has been a real invitation to organized crime 
deconcini said adding that the hearings will look into the 
inability or unwillingness of tribal leaders to resist and 
inadequate laws and enforcement 
officials said the senate inquiry has taken investigators to 30 
states more than 900000 pages of documents have been reviewed and 
more than 600 people interviewed 
the panel has subpoenaed more than 270 people and after 
consulting with the justice department granted immunity to an 
undisclosed number including indian aides and contracting company 
owners the republic said

authorities sunday blamed a travel iron 
with a faulty cord which a guest had plugged into a socket for 
starting a hotel fire that killed three people and injured 14 others 
fire marshal william reinhard said at a news conference that the 
126room hotel bethlehem passed inspection three months ago 
the fire started shortly after 7 am saturday after guest murial 
brooks of croton falls ny plugged the iron into the electrical 
socket and a chair caught fire ms brooks and officials said 
the blaze spread to a second room on the fifth floor but was 
confined to those two rooms in the ninestory building fire 
commissioner carmen oliver said the fire was out by noon 
about 20 of the 190 guests at the hotel friday night were elderly 
people staying there while a nearby retirement housing complex was 
being renovated at least 100 rooms were occupied by people 
attending a convention for the music teachers national association 
according to dee decker who owns the hotel with her husband robert 
officials identified the dead as monique forbes 58 who lived at 
the hotel and john kelly 75 and charles r knouse 69 who were 
staying at the hotel while the retirement home was being renovated 
five of 14 people treated at hospitals remained there sunday 
officials said three of the five all over age 65 were in critical 
condition 
the deckers said four employees knocked on guests doors to alert 
them to the fire although several guests said they did not hear 
fire alarms mrs decker said the employees told her the alarms were 
sounding 
david lloyd city emergency medical services supervisor said the 
number of injuries probably was reduced because of the quick 
reaction of residents 
it didnt look like panic lloyd said the people were very 
calm for what they had been through they deserve some credit 
for that these people were thinking 
the deckers bought the hotel built on the same site as 
bethlehems first house was built in 1741 from bethlehem steel 
corp in 1984 and said they updated the fire system then they 
estimated damage in the millions of dollars

the head of a bankrupt munitions company 
says an army recommendation to detonate some of the plants 
explosives on the spot rather than risk moving them is unnecessary 
because there is no danger of an accidental blast 
lakeland residents have nothing to fear said edward geoghegan 
who was chief executive officer when sooner defense of florida inc 
filed for protection from its creditors july 19 the company is 
being liquidated by a federal bankruptcy court 
i know one thing id be willing to take myself and my family 
out there and ill go look in the buildings he said friday the 
only thing i cannot speak to is what the government has done since 
theyve been out there 
us bankruptcy court judge thomas baynes who is presiding over 
the sooner proceedings had asked the government to remove any 
hazardous materials from the plant which made fuses to detonate 
other explosives for the military 
an army explosives expert capt kurt ponting inspected the site 
and testified wednesday that one or two small buildings at the plant 
a few miles west of lakeland should be blown up he said he will 
head a special team to decide which explosives can be moved and 
which should be detonated 
pontings principal concern was over a compound called lead 
azide described in chemical textbooks as a severe explosion risk 
it was usually placed for an hour or two in drying ovens about the 
size of outhouses but some has been in a couple of ovens ever since 
the plant closed officials said 
certainly there are dangerous explosives out there theres no 
doubt about that geoghegan conceded but he added i would 
match sooners handling of explosives against any ammunition company 
in the whole country we were the best 
until the hearing even government attorneys had been saying it 
would be a relatively simple and short process to remove the 
explosives said robert soriano attorney for citizens fidelity bank 
and trust of louisville ky sooners largest secured creditor 
told of the army proposal don seeger a former sooner explosives 
expert said id have to see it but it sounds like a drastic 
move to blow the material in place when its only been in storage 
six months 
trustee daniel bakst who was appointed by baynes in december to 
liquidate the company said i agree with geoghegan that its 
blown out of proportion 
ponting estimates it will cost the government up to 1 million 
and take up to four months to remove all explosives

afghan troops and 
moslem guerrillas fought for control of this highway sunday as the 
soviet army moved out what may have been the last convoy to leave 
afghanistan by truck 
a convoy of soviet soldiers driving armored personnel carriers 
and trucks loaded with missile launchers and other equipment cruised 
through a soviet bunker checkpoint as helicopter gunships hovered 
nearby offering cover 
the highway the only road to the soviet border winds through 
mountains where the rebels are waiting for the red army to complete 
its withdrawal 
two groundattack jets streaked overhead and then disappeared 
behind the snowcovered mountains just beyond the hills surrounding 
the capital of kabul 
this could be the last convoy said a soviet diplomat who 
spoke on condition of anonymity he refused to elaborate 
rebels based in pakistan reported sunday that soviet bombing and 
missile attacks along the highway have killed 600 civilians and 
injured 1200 
the mangled bodies are still under the debris the afghan new 
agency said in a telexed statement it was unclear whether the 
agency operated from pakistan by a rebel group was repeating a 
similar report it made saturday 
official radio kabul monitored in islamabad pakistan said 
sunday night that afghan troops had carried out successful 
military operations with civilians who want to keep the 260mile 
salang highway open 
the inhabitants of the salang highway assisted the forces as 
they hate the robbers and complete security has been restored on 
the highway it said 
at a soviet checkpoint about 12 miles north of kabul on sunday 
afghan soldiers paced nervously along the highway 
soviet soldiers in the convoy looked bored 
hows everything going one afghan officer was asked 
very bad he said 
earlier sunday afghan soldiers said the rebels known as 
mujahedeen fired on a convoy of about 350 trucks carrying flour 
eggs diesel fuel gasoline and other supplies down the highway to 
kabul one driver an afghan was slightly injured by a bullet that 
grazed his leg they said 
when asked what would happen when the soviets are gone an 
officer said the mujahedeen 
tass reported sunday that a soviet delegation led by yuri 
maslyukov a nonvoting member of the ruling politburo arrived in 
kabul 
maslyukov finance minister boris gostev and minister for 
external economic konstantin katushev met with afghan president 
najib to discuss soviet economic aid to afghanistan the official 
soviet news agency said 
it said the discussion focused on how the soviet union would help 
the afghans thwart the oppositions plans to establish an economic 
blockade of the capital and that moscow would supply food fuel 
and essentials 
in pakistan western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity 
said that in the past week an average of 18 soviet transport planes 
a day had landed and taken off from kabul more than twice the 
number reported the previous week 
the aircraft deliver arms and food to the beleaguered city then 
depart with hundreds of soviet soldiers the diplomats said 
the soviets sent about 115000 troops into afghanistan in 
december 1979 to prop up a marxist government that seized power in a 
coup the previous year 
the red army began pulling out eight months ago under an 
agreement sponsored by the united nations to end the nineyear 
intervention 
soviet diplomats in kabul say the remaining 15000 to 20000 
troops could be gone by the end of the week about 10 days before 
the un deadline the remaining soldiers apparently were to leave 
on transport planes 
the guerrillas are not a party to the un agreement and have 
vowed to overthrow najibs government once the soviets are gone

president saddam hussein agreed sunday to a 
un proposal to set up a joint military committee with iran 
baghdad radio said 
diplomats in the iraqi capital said it is a significant 
breakthrough in un efforts to revive stalled peace talks to end 
the eightyear gulf war 
the radio did not elaborate on the committees function 
but the diplomats who requested anonymity said a joint military 
group signaled hopes of a troop withdrawal by both sides the group 
could work with un military observers monitoring the aug 20 
ceasefire they said 
iraqs and irans failure to agree on a withdrawal called for 
under a july 1987 security council resolution has been a major 
sticking point in talks that have dragged on inconclusively for five 
months 
stateowned baghdad radio said saddam agreed to the joint 
committee during a fourhour meeting sunday with jan eliasson 
special envoy of un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
eliasson swedens ambassador to the united nations arrived in 
baghdad friday after four days of talks with iranian leaders in 
tehran 
iraqs broadcast said saddam also agreed to lift a ban barring 
iranianbound civilian flights from flying over iraq 
the radio did not elaborate but saddam appears to be making an 
effort to give new impetus to the stalled negotiations 
talks broke down in geneva on nov 11 iran says it considers 
further talks futile unless iraq halts what it calls delaying 
tactics 
baghdad radio reported that saddam reiterated to eliasson that 
iraq rejects any iranian preconditions to resuming negotiations 
iran says that before it returns to the negotiating table iraq 
must agree to the complete and immediate implementation of the 
security council resolution including withdrawing troops to the 
prewar border 
baghdad radio said saddam agreed to participate in the joint 
military committee and to lift the flight ban out of iraqs 
keenness for the un envoys mission to succeed and its readiness 
to cooperate with him 
saddam called on iran to display the same commitment to the 
united nations resolution through practical steps and deeds the 
radio reported 
a spokesman for the un mission gianni picco declined comment 
on sundays developments 
iran charges iraq is blocking agreement by refusing to withdraw 
from 260 square miles of iranian border territory captured in final 
stages of the fighting iraq says it will not withdraw until iran 
agrees to surrender its right to search ships in the gulf for 
iraqbound war materiel 
the two sides also dispute ownership of the shattalarab

the government under fire for its 
handling of the libyan scandal will impose much harsher penalties 
for illegal exports of materials that could be used to make chemical 
weapons a newspaper said sunday 
also sunday a magazine reported that nuclear materials that 
originated in the united states were sent to india through a west 
german company in 1984 and suggested they could have been used to 
make atomic weapons 
west german authorities are investigating several companies 
linked to shipments for a libyan plant that us officials say was 
designed to make chemical weapons libyan officials say the plant 
will make pharmaceuticals 
some us congressmen say west german officials looked the other 
way while german companies made possibly illegal exports to libya 
and other countries 
the west german government says it plans to stiffen export 
controls to hinder shipment of material that could be used for 
chemical and atomic weapons 
the newspaper welt am sonntag released what it said were 
details of those plans saying they are contained in a secret 
paper the government will present to parliament it did not say 
when 
according to the newspaper the government wants to double the 
maximum fine for such violations from 273000 to 546000 and to 
increase the maximum jail sentence from three years to five 
a key part of the proposal would be changing current law to allow 
seizure of any profits made from illegal sales the newspaper said 
the west german inquiries also center on allegations that german 
companies helped iraq with its chemical weapons program and on 
suspicions that sensitive nuclear materials were delivered to 
pakistan 
iraq has acknowledged using chemical weapons during its war with 
iran and reports say pakistan has the ability to make nuclear 
weapons 
west german leaders have denied us allegations they were too 
slow in launching investigations against suspected violators of 
export laws meanwhile more allegations are cropping up weeks after 
the libyan scandal first broke 
in editions to appear monday der spiegel magazine said the west 
german company degussa sent 210 pounds of beryllium to india in 1984 
and that a large part of this material originated in the usa 
der spiegel said it based its report on unidentified documents to 
which the magazine had obtained access 
beryllium frequently is used in nuclear reactors der spiegel 
said it can also be used in the production of atomic weapons 
the magazine said degussa served as middleman in the shipment 
the news magazine did not identify the american parties allegedly 
involved 
the transaction occurred at a time when there were worldwide 
rumors that india was developing an atomic bomb the magazine said 
according to der spiegel the material was sent to the bhabha 
atomic research center near bombay 
the magazine said west german authorities approved the permits 
because the government did not believe the exports would help india 
build nuclear weapons 
neither government nor degussa officials could be reached for 
comment sunday night 
in a separate article the magazine said west german intelligence 
officials knew for a long time of german shipments to iraq of 
chemicals that could be used to make biological weapons 
but according to the magazine the intelligence officials did not 
inform the west german chancellors office of what it knew until 
the worldwide uproar over german shipments to libya 
west german officials have not acknowledged involvement by german 
companies in a possible biological arms plant in iraq

kanagawa prefectural police speaking on condition of anonymity 
no group claimed responsibility for the blast the official said 
he said a lawn shed and the kitchen of kamijos twostory wooden 
house were damaged by the explosion police found bits of a timer 
that might have triggered the blast the official said 
because of kamijos position the attack could have been the work 
of radicals who oppose the planned expansion of the airport at 
narita 40 miles northeast of tokyo the official said 
the council oversees land acquisition for public use including 
the expropriation of farmland to build an additional runway at the 
25 billion airport which opened in 1978 
local farmers have opposed the move and radical leftists have 
taken up the cause

neighbors play touch football the 
pizza delivery van makes its rounds and people who drive too fast 
get tickets from sheriffs deputies aboard snowmobiles 
for three months each year just 10 miles from downtown st paul 
hundreds of people sit on the frozen white bear lake for hours even 
days at a time some are outside others are snug in fish houses 
makeshift structures to protect anglers from the wind warmed by 
wood stoves or propane heaters 
by midjanuary nearly 350 plywood shacks are scattered across 
the lake most clumped into several small villages rutted roads 
lead to populated points on the ice fanning out from about six 
points on the shore a speed limit of 35 mph is enforced by 
sheriffs deputies on their snowmobiles 
the shacks are grouped into villages for several reasons safety 
from vandalism easy access from the main roads and the belief that 
if everyone else is fishing at a certain spot it must be good 
but the community disappears each spring when the nearly two feet 
of ice underneath it melts 
brad stanius a legislator from white bear lake and a wellknown 
angler said he cant set up a permanent house on the lake or 
hundreds of people would drill their fishing holes nearby 
theyd assume i know the right spots he said he uses a 
portable house instead that can be set up in minutes 
in one corner of steve bruskis house near shore are his 
provisions doughnuts chocolate milk and a couple of cans of pepsi 
an 18by24inch fishing hole is in another corner 
bruski of st paul and his friends keep two snowmobiles nearby 
so they can dash around the lake when the fishing is slow on white 
bear theres always a flurry of nonfishing social activity 
fourwheeldrive vehicles and snowmobiles race by at all hours 
crosscountry skiers glide past silently planes fly low over the 
lake to check out the action 
dominos delivers pizzas on the ice during the day but wont go 
out at night because drivers have trouble identifying specific 
dwellings 
rich vondelinde and jim fincel like to come out on new years day 
and super bowl sunday hook a television set to a battery and watch 
the games 
vondelinde built his house several years ago using discarded 
office partitions theres a propane heater against one wall a coat 
rack and a shelf near the door light green carpeting on the wooden 
floor its larger than most shacks about 12 by 6 feet 
a skylight in the ceiling is the latest improvement there are 
plans for two electric lights next year to be powered by a marine 
battery 
when theyre waiting for the fish to bite vondelinde and fincel 
play cribbage atop a plywood sheet over a plastic bucket 
last week the news spread quickly when someone pulled a big 
northern pike out of the lake 
ken matheson at the bait shop heard it was a 28pounder 
twentysix said an angler in the village of icehouses just north of 
manitou island about 20 pounds is what i heard said a spear 
fisherman near bellaire beach 
maybe it was actually a 15pounder that grew and grew in the 
telling it doesnt really matter to the citizenry on the lake 
legends thats whats fishings all about said matheson 
its 10 percent fishing and 90 percent talking

a palestinian leader jailed without trial 
through most of the 13month uprising in the occupied lands was 
freed sunday and said he envisions direct talks soon between israel 
and the plo 
i believe that they the israelis have decided that their 
enemy is the plo and who do you make peace with but your enemy 
said faisal husseini 
husseini who met in jail recently with israeli government 
officials predicted progress in the next few months toward 
resolving the conflict but he refused to elaborate 
he told reporters he believes the palestine liberation 
organization will support a unbacked referendum on statehood for 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip but not elections for local 
representatives as suggested by some israeli leaders 
husseini 48 is considered the most powerful proplo leader in 
the occupied lands 
in the occupied territories meanwhile hospital officials 
reported 12 palestinians were wounded by israeli soldiers who fired 
at stonethrowing youths sunday the army confirmed six casualties 
it said troops in the gaza strip sealed the homes of six 
palestinians accused of attacking soldiers and arabs suspected of 
collaborating with israel in the west bank town of tulkarem troops 
detained about 70 arabs suspected of rioting israel army radio said 
in the west banks largest city nablus leaflets appeared for 
the first time signed by the arab socialist baath party the party 
of president hafez assad in syria arab reporters said 
the leaflets condemned us imperialism and said palestinians who 
favor elections are playing into israels hands the only language 
that the enemy understands is the thugs language they said 
later sunday the defense ministry said husseini met last week in 
his prison cell with defense minister yitzhak rabins top adviser 
shmuel goren and discussed the occupied territories israel radio 
reported rabin briefed the cabinet on the talks 
husseini refused to directly confirm the meeting but said i 
prefer if mr goren speaks first 
husseini denied israeli media reports that he would serve as an 
intermediary between israel and the plo 
i dont know why they need an intermediary he said what 
is the difference if faisal husseini is a messenger or they have 
direct contacts 
husseini noted that israelis even some in the government are 
more open to the palestinian guerrilla movement since plo leader 
yasser arafat recognized israel and renounced terrorism 
some of the israelis in the high levels of the government are 
going in a new way which i believe is in the right direction he 
told israel radio taking the unusual step of speaking hebrew 
cabinet minister ezer weizmann said friday that prime minister 
yitzhak shamir should end the ban on talking to the plo on sunday 
israel radio quoted shamir as saying that israel is ready to 
negotiate with palestinians but not the plo 
shamir also has called rabins recent suggestion on elections an 
unofficial proposal and said the government still is formulating its 
peace initiative 
rabin plans to hold further meetings with palestinians on his 
proposal hoping to shift the focus of attention from the plo to 
local leaders in the occupied lands israel television reported 
husseini was believed imprisoned to control the uprising he was 
never tried and said he was not informed of charges against him 
they gave me no evidence and said it was all in a secret 
file he said 
also sunday israel agreed to raise the egyptian flag over the 
disputed taba border area it was a symbolic concession reflecting 
israels plans to return the 250acre beach strip to egyptian rule 
and an attempt to restart talks toward resolving the issue the 
foreign ministry said

the sovietled warsaw pact on monday released a 
breakdown of its conventional forces in europe that it said shows 
rough parity with nato forces 
but a moscowbased western diplomat said the alliance appeared to 
have tailored the categories of forces to support its position that 
it is roughly equal in strength with the west 
the breakdown came in a statement by the warsaw pacts defense 
ministers committee and reported by the tass news agency 
the statement did not contain numbers of troops and weapons but 
said that when it is published monday in the communist party daily 
pravda the document will be accompanied by several tables and 
explanations concerning them 
mondays editions of pravda were not immediately available but 
the broad outlines contained in the statement differed sharply from 
nato reckonings 
in the statement the warsaw pact said the numerical strengths of 
the two military alliances ground and air forces are roughly 
equal but it added that usled nato has twice as many naval 
personnel as its eastern counterpart 
the statement also said 
nato has more frontline or tactical strike aircraft maritime 
strike aircraft combat helicopters and antitank rocket systems 
the warsaw pact has an advantage in tanks tactical missile 
launchers interceptor warplanes of air defense forces combat 
infrantry vehicles armored personnel carriers and artillery 
nato enjoys a considerable margin of superiority in naval 
warplanes and large surface ships such as aircraft carriers 
the eastern alliance has a certain advantage in submarines 
armed with missiles and torpedoes 
both sides are to sit down in vienna on march 7 to discuss the 
issues in negotiations on conventional armed forces in europe 
the talks were given a boost dec 7 when soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev announced the kremlin would reduce the red army by a 
500000 troops by 1991 moscow also says it will reduce its weapons 
by 10000 tanks 8500 artillery systems and 800 combat planes 
following moscows lead romania bulgaria czechoslovakia 
hungary east germany and poland have announced cuts in their own 
military forces 
nato officials citing what they say is warsaw pact superiority 
have said it would be unwise for the western alliance to reduce its 
armed forces in response to the eastern cuts 
nato contends the soviets have a 2to1 manpower edge and 3to1 
tank advantage the new warsaw pact statement however says that 
overall the two sides are close 
the military balance in europe considering all its 
ingredients can be described as a rough parity which does not give 
a possibility to either side to count on a decisive military 
advantage the statement said 
it added that there is still a need to reduce forces in europe 
to ensure stability corresponding to the principle of reasonable 
defensive sufficiency 
the western diplomat contended that broad assertions such as 
those in the warsaw pact statement are largely meaningless unless 
backed up by specific figures and definitions of what is included in 
each category of forces

israel agreed on sunday to let egypt raise its 
flag over the disputed taba border area in a symbolic concession 
reflecting israels plans to return the 250acre beach strip to 
egyptian rule 
israel acceded to egypts request to fly its flag in an attempt 
to get talks moving on the last obstacles before the land along the 
red sea is handed back said foreign ministry spokesman alon liel 
we hope this decision will help defuse the tensions that have 
been created in the past few days and enable the working committees 
to resume their talks liel said 
he said egypts ambassador to israel mohammed bassiouny was 
pleased by israels response 
late sunday egypt issued a presidential decree authorizing its 
tourism ministry to negotiate compensation for israeli property 
owners in taba israel radio said israeli officials termed the 
document moderate and said they will study it the radio 
reported 
the talks over taba ran into trouble last week when egyptian 
officials said they would consider the land to be under egypts 
sovereignty as of sunday 60 days after an international arbitration 
panel sided with egypt 
the declaration alarmed israeli officials who first want to 
settle issues such as access for israeli tourists and compensation 
for israeli owners of a luxury hotel and a holiday resort village in 
taba 
the beach strip captured by israel in the 1967 middle east war 
has been a subject of dispute between the countries since 1982 at 
that time israel refused to return it to egypt along with the rest 
of the sinai peninsula under the terms of the nations 1979 peace 
treaty 
in 1986 the two sides agreed to take the dispute to an 
international arbitration panel in geneva for a binding ruling the 
panel drew a border that put taba in egyptian territory 
liel said egypt is to raise its flag on its side of the border 
marker about 150 yards from the gulf of aqaba and israel is to do 
the same on its side

anthropologist richard leakey said on 
sunday he has been asked to return as director of the national 
museums of kenya a post he resigned a week ago 
but he said he will await a formal offer from the board of 
trustees before he agrees to return until then ill stay in my 
shamba farm he said 
leakey resigned on jan 20 to facilitate the reorganization 
currently being carried out by the ministry of home affairs he 
said at the time 
the 45yearold son anthropologist said in a press release that 
the ministry had appointed a new board of trustees for the museum 
which houses africas best collection of fossils and human artifacts 
without consulting him 
he said sunday that the situation is confusing and that he was 
waiting for the government to dissolve the new board and reinstate 
the previous one 
there cant be two boards leakey said the ministry did 
not say the board it had appointed had been dissolved but the old 
board had not been legally dissolved either 
last month a nairobi newspaper the standard quoted unnamed 
museum employees as blaming leakey for an exodus of african 
scientists from the institution which has a staff of 300 but 
museum employees later signed a public letter defending their 
director 
a kenya citizen leakey is a high school dropout who learned 
anthropolgy from two pioneers his parents louis and mary he had 
headed the museum for 20 years 
in 1972 leakey found a skull of a manlike creature while 
leading an expedition near lake turkana in northwestern kenya 
the skull was later established to be at least 25 million years 
old pushing mankinds prehistoric family tree back at least a 
million years 
until richards 1972 discovery the oldest precusor of man was 
thought to date back 15 million years based on discoveries made by 
his father 14 years earlier

unidentified guerrillas attacked 
israelibacked militiamen with rockets and machinegun fire in south 
lebanon on sunday wounding four militiamen police reported 
a police spokesman said the guerrillas attacked a patrol of the 
south lebanon army in the village of nabi taher inside israels 
selfdesignated security zone 
the spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
said the militiamen retaliated by shelling the nearby village of 
kfar roumman while two israeli helicopter gunships buzzed the 
village and dropped flares no casualties were reported from the 
shelling 
israel established the security zone a 6 to 10mile deep strip 
just inside the lebanese border when it withdrew the bulk of its 
invading army from lebanon in 1985 after a threeyear occupation 
the zone patrolled by the south lebanon army and israeli troops 
serves as a buffer zone against crossborder guerrilla forays into 
israel

the greenpeace ecological group said 
sunday it would put up a human barrier to stop harpooners on a 
japanese whaling fleet from killing more whales in antarctica 
at the moment were just following the factory ship said 
expedition coordinator peter wilkinson interviewed from sydney by 
radio telephone aboard the greenpeace ship gondwana 
weve got some tactics up our sleeve we plan a peaceful 
campaign of interference and harassment he said basically we 
plan to form a human barrier to deny the harpoonist the site of a 
whale 
wilkinson declined to discuss specifics the greenpeace ship has 
been shadowing the japanese whaling fleet in antarctic waters for 
the past week 
he said the japanese who claim the kill is necessary to 
scientifically determine whaling stocks killed 10 whales on 
saturday 
japan has said it plans to hunt 300 whales this season despite a 
moratorium by the international whaling commission 
we are redoubling our efforts to expose this project for what 
it is a simple slaughter of whales for commercial ends wilkinson 
said 
he said said greenpeace was told earlier sunday that crews of the 
three japanese ships would use water hoses and clubs to repel 
greenpeace protesters if they tried to board the whalers 
greenpeace which champions environmental and antinuclear 
issues has been in the antarctic for the past three weeks and has 
enough provisions to stay in the region until the end of february 
wilkinson said 
he said the group probably will remain with the japanese for 
several more days before heading south to monitor environmental 
conditions at the us base at mcmurdo sound which it claims dumps 
too much waste onto the ice 
greenpeace is campaigning to have the southern continent declared 
a world park antarctica is believed to hold rich mineral resources 
and greenpeace fears that such exploitation could ignite military 
conflict

solidarity leader lech walesa appealed to 
supporters on sunday to support his talks with the government that 
he said could lead to greater economic and political freedom 
i know there are many opponents both on our side and on the 
other one i need your help because it is not going to be easy 
walesa told 3000 people at st brygidas church in gdansk 
solidarity leaders and top government officials on friday agreed 
to meet feb 6 for the first session of broadbased talks between 
the authorities and opposition that will decide the future of the 
banned union 
solidarity leaders have fought to regain the unions legal status 
ever since parliament banned it in late 1982 following the december 
1981 martial law crackdown 
the whole evil and present dramatic situation had its source in 
monopoly so monopoly will have to be replaced with pluralism 
walesa said 
the word pluralism is used in poland to refer to greater 
political and economic freedom and monopoly refers to the communist 
partys control over economic and political activities 
at a news conference on saturday solidarity adviser bronislaw 
geremek said that both the government and solidarity agreed that 
reform was necessary to combat polands deteriorating economy 
the solidarity leader said that the union had no intention of

justice of the united states in 1986 and hasnt heard a case since 
stands to receive a 60000ayear pay raise because he claimed 
status as a senior judge rather than full retirement 
burger is not alone an additional 305 senior judges also legally 
qualify for the activeduty pay raises according to administrative 
records obtained by the associated press that indicate one in five

the title of senior judge created by congress in 1919 allows

appointed for life though they may choose to resign at any time 
most senior judges hear cases but burger says he doesnt have 
the time by contrast since he followed burger off the bench in

4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond va and next month 
will sit on the 11th us circuit court of appeals in florida 
burger declined to answer questions about his impending pay 
increase and his judicial workload other than to say im too busy 
to sit 
most senior judges do substantial work and as a group they handle 
between 10 percent and 15 percent of all federal cases across the 
nation the federal judiciary would be a mess without the help of 
senior judges says appeals court judge frank coffin 
receiving activeduty pay raises while accepting no cases may not 
seem equitable but it is not unlawful whatever congress actually 
expected of the senior judges current statutes require nothing in 
return for the activeduty salary increases 
it doesnt seem fair said rep carlos moorhead a member of 
a house subcommittee overseeing the federal judiciary the 
california republican said congress may want to study establishing 
some minimum work to qualify for the raises 
dozens of senior judges apparently accept no cases the ap has 
learned 
a report compiled by the administrative office of the us courts 
provides rare caseload data on senior judges for the year ending 
june 30 1987 the study showed that 56 of 271 senior judges or 21 
percent handled no cases of the 56 49 were over 75 years old 
if you did the survey today i dont think things would be much 
different said david cook a statistician who put together the 
report for the administrative office the report contains coded 
numbers instead of the names of judges cook said office policy bars 
him from releasing information on individual judges or more recent 
composite data there are now a total of 306 including burger but 
cook said the patterns found in 1987 are not out of date 
stephen gillers professor of legal ethics at new york 
university said as a lawyer and law teacher i would be troubled 
if judges were being paid for doing nothing and getting increments 
for doing nothing unless congress made a conscious decision that 
even judges in total retirement should get pay raises 
congress did no such thing judges who retire by resigning 
receive pensions that equal their last years salary but not 
subsequent increases if burger had taken full retirement in 
september 1986 his annual pension would be 108400 instead he 
received a 1987 increase to 115000 and next month he stands to 
receive a 52 percent boost to 175000 the salary earmarked for the 
sitting chief justice william rehnquist 
burger who spent much of his career campaigning for higher 
salaries for judges took senior status even though he knew at the 
time he would be working as the fulltime chairman of the 
celebration of the 200th anniversaries of the constitution and the 
bill of rights 
supreme court spokeswoman toni house said the 81yearold burger 
has not been asked to hear any cases because she presumed 
rehnquist is aware of burgers bicentennial responsibilities for 
which burger is not paid 
the largest salary increases in a decade for top federal 
officials take effect feb 8 unless congress disapproves 
comparatively unnoticed in the political controversy over the 50 
percent congressional pay raise are increases just as generous or 
nearly so for the judiciary 
district judge salaries would rise from 89500 to 135000 
appellate judges from 95000 to 140000 and supreme court 
justices from 110000 to 165000 
professor gillers said that even beyond the law there is nothing 
in the judicial code of conduct that makes it unethical for a senior 
judge to do no work and collect pay raises 
i cant speak to the personal propriety every judge has to 
make that decision for himself gillers said adding if the law 
allows them to enjoy senior status without working and they choose 
to do so then they are behaving perfectly ethically it may be the 
statute should be changed 
moorhead the congressman whose skepticism last year sidetracked 
house action on a bill to lower the age at which a judge qualifies 
for senior status said we need to look into this much further 
coffin a federal appellate judge from portland maine who plans 
to take senior status soon and maintain a substantial caseload said 
the equity of the system is a good theoretical question 
if there were more frequent pay raises for judges id be more 
bothered coffin said the last increase came in 1987 but many 
jurists have complained for years that they are woefully underpaid 
compared to top attorneys who regularly argue cases before them 
the judicial pay raises are not limited to the federal court 
systems 750 active judges but would go also to senior judges 
congress created the category 70 years ago to make way for younger 
judges while expanding the capacity of the federal courts today 
judges who are at least 65 years old and have 15 years on the 
federal bench or those 70 with 10 years experience face three 
options 
keep working the constitution makes it a lifetime appointment 
take full retirement by resigning and receive for life the 
annual salary earned on their last day on the bench 
take senior status with salaries that rise along with those of 
active judges these judges can choose the number and type of cases 
they handle 
the advantage of resignation is the opportunity to take other 
jobs such as practicing law the advantage has not lured many there 
are only 13 former judges who chose to retire by resignation 
compared to the 306 who took senior status 
many observers say senior judges are essential to the federal 
court system in one of the nations busiest federal courthouses 
the us district court in philadelphia senior judges last year 
carried 22 percent of the workload 
theyre providing an invaluable contribution to the judicial 
system said michael kunz that courts clerk

communist leaders are bitterly 
divided over how to end the nations worst postwar crisis as they 
prepare for a historic meeting of the policymaking central 
committee staterun media said sunday 
the meeting on monday is expected to generate a showdown between 
rival factions and may result in sweeping personnel changes that 
will indicate whether the country will institute economic and 
democratic reform 
sources close to the ninemember federal presidency which also 
heads the armed forces told the associated press that the 
presidency has warned emergency measures would be imposed nationwide 
if a compromise within the ruling elite is not reached 
the state tanjug news agency said that at the historic 
meeting the leaders should concretely state their views about a 
series of delicate and open political problems which have brought 
the communist party to the brink of its total split and the country 
to the most dramatic postwar period 
liberal factions in the ruling league of communists face a 
hardline coalition led by the president of serbias communists 
slobodan milosevic 
the session of the partys central committee which has about 160 
members is to discuss calls for replacement of the countrys 
communist party president stipe suvar who serbian leaders blame for 
the wide split within the party 
the staterun media indicated that the confrontation is in fact 
the clash between two political and economic concepts of 
yugoslavias future development 
suvar a pragmatist and milosevics chief political opponent is 
from croatia and is also supported by slovenia both liberal 
republics that favor increased pluralism more democracy and radical 
marketoriented reforms as a solution to the countrys woes 
these include a 250percent inflation rate a sharp drop in 
living standards and an alarming increase of labor and ethnic unrest 
milosevic who has suppressed all opposition to his authoritarian 
style of leadership in serbia draws his support from the countrys 
poorer regions which fear that marketoriented reforms would end 
state subsidies for their moneylosing industries leading to 
massive layoffs and further public unrest 
the plenum will indicate where the country is going the 
influential croatian daily vjesnik said 
in a possible indication of the outcome the presidency on jan 
19 named as premier ante markovic who favors marketoriented reform 
milosevics opponents claim that by orchestrating the attacks on 
suvar and other federal officials outside serbia he is setting the 
final stage for a power struggle at the plenum in order to impose 
his own brand of ideological dogmatism on all of yugoslavia

in the 5 years since he became us attorney for 
the southern district of new york rudolph w giuliani has been 
called many things gangbuster muckraker publicity hound and 
merciless zealot of law and order 
in a recent interview with the associated press giuliani who 
announced jan 10 that he would leave his post by the end of the 
month assessed his mistakes and triumphs 
giuliani 44 reiterated that he plans to practice law and decide 
during the next two months whether to run for mayor 
giuliani a republican who abandoned the no 3 spot in the reagan 
justice department in 1983 to head the countrys most prominent 
federal prosecutors office gained attention with his aggressive 
campaign against organized crime in new york 
a public official of italian descent who was willing to use the 
word mafia at news conferences giuliani became a media darling 
as he sent the heads of new york crime families and numerous 
sicilian hispanic and asian drug cartels to prison 
when he turned the same racketeering laws on insider traders and 
political grafters protests arose on wall street and in political 
clubhouses complaining giuliani was too eager to bring criminal 
charges and too willing to announce them at news conferences 
i dont take great delight in prosecuting people or sending 
them to prison said giuliani i havent made criminal anything 
that congress hasnt made criminal 
one mistake giuliani concedes was the hasty insider trading 
indictment of wall street executives robert freeman richard wigton 
and timothy tabor the financial community was outraged in february 
1987 when wigton was led away in handcuffs from his office 
the charges were dropped three months later when a judge refused 
to give prosecutors more time to prepare for trial giuliani 
promised to reindict the trio but has yet to do so prompting 
critics to charge he had no case or only a weak one and hoped to 
pressure the three men into striking a plea bargain 
the case was considerably more complicated for all sorts of 
reasons than we recognized said giuliani 
some of his harshest criticism came for the unsuccessful 
prosecution of former miss america bess myerson 64 
many people wondered why giuliani made a federal case of 
myersons alleged bribery of a divorce court judge with a 
19000ayear city job for the judges daughter 
that could be asked of all the federal prosecutions that we 
bring said giuliani ticking off charges brought against scores 
of city electrical inspectors and county highway inspectors for 
bribes as small as 500 
his toughest case wedtech giuliani answers without 
hesitation because it involved people who were close to my 
supervisor the attorney general of the united states 
the investigation of the nowdefunct wedtech corp a bronx 
defense contractor led to the racketeering conviction of former 
us rep mario biaggi dny and several others 
defense lawyers claimed thenattorney general edwin meese iii was 
just as heavily involved in the scandal to defuse the socalled 
meese defense a prosecutor with giulianis approval told 
the jury meese was a sleaze but said it had no bearing on the 
biaggi trial 
i believe most people on the outside of the justice 
department agreed with the comment said giuliani who declined 
to give his personal opinion of meese who was never charged with 
criminal activities 
theres no doubt that it was a justifiable comment based on the 
evidence in that case giuliani said warily

president saddam hussein agreed sunday to a 
un proposal to set up a joint military committee with persian gulf 
rival iran a un envoy said 
after a fourhour meeting with saddam un envoy jan eliasson 
said the iraqi president also agreed to lift a ban barring 
iranianbound civilian flights from flying over iraq 
diplomats said the development also reported by official baghdad 
radio is a significant breakthrough in un efforts to revive 
stalled peace talks to end the eightyear gulf war 
eliasson told the associated press after his negotiations in 
tehran and baghdad that the agreements were the two most concrete 
measures that could improve the atmosphere but added i dont 
want to speak about breakthroughs 
still he said he was hopeful of new highlevel talks 
diplomats in the iraqi capital who requested anonymity said a 
joint military group signaled hopes of a troop withdrawal by both 
sides the group could work with un military observers monitoring 
the aug 20 ceasefire they said 
iraqs and irans failure to agree on a withdrawal called for 
under a july 1987 security council resolution has been a major 
sticking point in talks that have dragged on inconclusively for five 
months 
eliasson swedens un ambassador and special envoy of un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar arrived in baghdad friday 
after four days of talks with iranian leaders he is due back in new 
york on tuesday 
the envoy said the mixed military working group would be formed 
under un supervision but he said he was not sure what level of 
military commander would serve from each side 
eliasson also said new talks were possible 
the secretarygeneral and i are hopeful of being able to meet 
with the foreign ministers of iran and iraq in new york in the near 
future he said 
he could not specify a date saying perez de cuellar had to 
confirm the most appropriate forum for the talks 
talks broke down in geneva on nov 11 iran says it considers 
further talks futile unless iraq halts what it calls delaying 
tactics 
baghdad radio reported that saddam reiterated to eliasson that 
iraq rejects any iranian conditions to resuming negotiations but 
eliasson said no conditions have been set for the proposed talks 
iran has said that before it returns to the negotiating table 
iraq must agree to the complete and immediate implementation of the 
security council resolution including withdrawing troops to the 
prewar border 
baghdad radio said saddam agreed to participate in the joint 
military committee and to lift the flight ban out of iraqs 
keenness for the un envoys mission to succeed and its readiness 
to cooperate with him 
iran charges iraq is blocking agreement by refusing to withdraw 
from 260 square miles of iranian border territory captured in final 
stages of the fighting iraq says it will not withdraw until iran 
agrees to surrender its right to search ships in the gulf for 
iraqbound war materiel 
the sides also dispute ownership of the shatt alarab waterway 
their prewar southern boundary

amnesty international on monday urged the world to 
pressure iran to halt a sixmonth campaign of political executions 
during which more than 1000 people have died 
the londonbased human rights group made its plea in a statement 
submitted to the united nations human rights commission which is 
scheduled to begin its annual meeting monday in geneva 
amnesty international detailed other abuses it said have 
persisted in iran including torture detention without trial and 
other cruel inhuman or degrading punishments 
the group also said it was concerned about a massive antidrug 
crackdown and 21 recorded instances of amputation usually of the 
four fingers of the right hand which it considered cruel inhuman 
or degrading 
tehran radio reported sunday that 22 more drug smugglers were 
hanged publicly in various iranian cities in the previous three 
days raising the total to 113 in the crackdown launched two weeks 
ago 
amnesty international urges the international community to use 
whatever channels are available to persuade the iranian government 
to put an end to the present wave of public executions and to 
implement and observe judicial and other procedures to safeguard the 
human rights of its citizens the statement said 
since the end of july 1988 amnesty international has recorded 
over 1000 names of political prisoners who have reportedly been 
executed the statement said and further reports are still 
being received 
amnesty international said that while it had expected a prisoner 
amnesty for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the islamic 
republic in february its welcome was muted because hundreds if 
not thousands of prisoners will be killed before the amnesty comes 
into effect 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has pardoned 
4500 convicts imprisoned in the northeastern province of khorasan 
and plans to start releasing them tuesday when celebrations begin 
the official islamic republic news agency has said 
amnesty international said it had appealed to iran on behalf of 
hundreds of prisoners at risk and asked for comment on reported 
victims but received no responses 
the wave of executions apparently was sparked by an incursion 
western iran from iraq by the national liberation army a group 
backed by the opposition group peoples mujahedeen organization of 
iran amnesty international said 
many victims were from that group and other opposition parties 
and groups involved in armed opposition to the government the 
statement said 
many were imprisoned for years before they were shot to death or 
hanged and among them there were a large number of prisoners of 
conscience and others serving prison terms imposed after unfair 
trials for their nonviolent political activity the statement 
said 
it said more people connected with opposition groups were being 
reported detained without charge young people were being singled 
out for random searches on the street by revolutionary guards and 
floggings continue to be a widely used

lebanons warring shiite moslem factions 
agreed late sunday to end a 9monthold power struggle that has 
claimed at least 500 lives officials announced 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati told reporters that 
the agreement between the syrianbacked amal and the proiranian 
hezbollah or party of god will be signed monday 
i will stay on until they sign said velayati who had been 
scheduled to fly back to tehran late sunday 
i hope that amal and hezbollah can continue their cooperation 
one of the most important subjects that both sides have agreed upon 
is the ceasefire he said outside the ministry 
the agreement came after both factions handed over to syria the 
assassins of leaders of both groups 
brig gen ghazi kenaan syrias military intelligence chief in 
lebanon told the associated press that hezbollah delivered the men 
who assassinated amals leader in south lebanon daoud daoud in a 
south beirut ambush sept 22 
he said syrian forces also were given an amal man accused by 
hezbollah of killing sheik ali krayyem one of its leaders in the 
bekaa valley of east lebanon soon after daoud daouds slaying 
he did not name them or say what will happen to them 
but the mutual surrender of the alleged assassins was apparently 
the key to securing the longelusive treaty after tough bargaining 
to end the war between the shiite rivals in lebanon 
more than 500 people have been killed and 1500 wounded since the 
hostility between the rival shiite movements exploded into open 
warfare in april 
the fighting has been halted several times through ceasefires 
arranged by syria and iran but the deeprooted enmity between the 
groups which has divided clans and families has repeatedly 
shattered the truces in bloody clashes 
the peace accord emerged from the meeting between velayati 
syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa and amal and hezbollah 
leaders 
amal leader nabih berri and hezbollah chieftains led by sheik 
ibrahim amin were brought in for facetoface talks after the 
foreign ministers hammered out a formula in three rounds of talks 
saturday and sunday 
asked whether the fate of 15 foreign hostages many of them 
widely believed to be held by groups linked to hezbollah would be 
affected by the peace treaty amin noted this matter has no 
relation with us nor with the agreement 
nine americans are among the captives and the longest held 
hostage is terry a anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
fighting between amal and hezbollah for control of lebanons 1 
million shiites the countrys largest sect has strained relations 
between damascus and tehran 
syria the main power broker in lebanon considers that country 
its sphere of influence and vital to its regional ambitions 
tehran has long sought to establish an islamicstyle islamic 
republic there through hezbollah the secular syrians view 
hezbollahs bid for power as a serious challenge 
the more secular and nationalist amal seeks a multisect 
government in lebanon with moslems sharing power with the 
traditionally dominant christians

a poll of 1000 moscow residents shows 
overwhelming support for mikhail gorbachevs economic restructuring 
but when pressed about half said the changes had no real impact on 
their lives 
the poll also indicated a majority of moscow residents admit the 
soviet war in afghanistan was a mistake and that former leader 
leonid brezhnev was bad for the country the daily news said in its 
sunday editions 
the poll conducted by the daily news along with five other news 
organizations shows gorbachevs economic reforms enjoy a 93 percent 
approval rating but when pressed 51 percent of those polled said 
the reforms have had no real impact on their lives and 17 percent 
said the reforms were having a negative impact the daily news 
reported 
the poll also found that many moscow residents are afraid to 
venture out at night and that only 37 percent said they are very 
proud to be soviet citizens 
the unprecedented poll was conducted in conjunction with wcbs 
radio and wcbstv in new york wcvbtv in boston krontv in san 
francisco and the detroit free press 
the poll was conducted by the soviet institute of sociology using 
questions from the news organizations the boston polling firm of 
marttila amp kiley which conducted the us end of the survey 
monitored the telephone interviews that took place between dec 12 
and dec 21 and compiled the results the pollsters reported a 
margin of sampling error of 31 percentage points 
on international relations the poll indicated that moscow 
residents are overwhelmingly optimistic about the united states and 
the soviet union getting along 
soviet experts said some of the results may not accurately 
reflect attitudes especially the overwhelming support for gorbachev 
we have no tradition of voicing public criticism of our 
leaders said vladimier andreyenkov of the soviet institute of 
sociology gorbachevs popularity is indeed high but i would take 
these figures with some reservations 
but the moscow residents 65 percent of them rated former leader 
brezhnev unfavorably and former dictator josef stalin received a 66 
percent unfavorable rating 
another factor that may have influenced the answers of the moscow 
residents is that they were told at the start of questioning that 
the poll was part of a joint ussoviet venture

the irish republican army on sunday said 
it would focus its violent attacks on the british army and try to 
avoid killing civilians 
the statement followed criticism by the iras legal political 
wing sinn fein during the partys threeday annual conference 
sinn fein leaders gerry adams and martin mcguinness on saturday 
expressed unhappiness with the killing of civilians in the iras 
fight against british rule in northern ireland 
at the close of the conference on sunday an unidentified man 
read a statement from the outlawed guerrilla groups ruling army 
council that said we will continue to attack british crown 
forces but heed gerry adams warning to avoid civilians 
the brief statement won loud applause from the 500 conference 
delegates 
in londonderry northern ireland on sunday mcguinness spoke on 
the same subject to a gathering of marchers commemorating the 
bloody sunday shooting of 1972 when 14 civilians were killed 
there by british troops during a roman catholic civil rights protest 
mcguinness said the ira had made an awful lot of mistakes 
involving the deaths of civilians 
a lot of mayhem was caused among innocent people he said 
but the ira showed integrity and courage in tackling the issue of 
civilian killings he said 
the ira have stood up and said yes it was wrong yes we will 
try to ensure it does not happen again he told a crowd of 3000 
i believe the ira have made mistakes they have killed people 
by accident but the reality is too many civilians have been killed 
some observers have linked sinn feins unusual rebuke to the 
partys determination to do well in elections this year 
as expected the conference unanimously agreed to comply with the 
new british government order that all candidates in northern ireland 
elections sign an antiviolence oath 
the party national executive had urged delegates not to allow 
any britishinspired oath or pledge to prevent sinn fein 
representing its electorate in local councils 
sinn feins leadership viewed the british move as an effort to 
remove the party from the political process in northern ireland 
a new law expected to be in effect in time for local elections in 
may will require candidates to sign a declaration that if elected 
they would not express support for terrorism any breach is to be 
punishable by a fiveyear ban from office 
skeptics have said sinn fein candidates would likely take the 
oath but ignore it

some prominent leaders on sunday called 
cuban president fidel castro a caribbean devil and a human 
rights offender who should not have been invited to pay a visit this 
week his first in 30 years 
castro along with over two dozen chiefs of state and high 
government officials including vice president dan quayle has 
accepted an invitation to attend the inauguration thursday of social 
democratic president carlos andres perez 
perez has said he will try to improve relations with cuba but has 
repeatedly said that ideological discrepancies between democratic 
venezuela and marxist cuba will remain insurmountable 
castro has been a factor of perturbation in the caribbean 
said manuel penalver a leader of the governing democratic action 
party venezuela does not win anything with his visit it rather 
loses international credibility 
penalver who until last year was the partys secretary general 
and represents the partys right wing called castro the caribbean 
devil saying the cuban leader tried to impose a marxist regime in 
venezuela 
castro visited venezuela in 1959 shortly after toppling dictator 
fulgencio batista castro received a warm welcome but the open 
support he later granted to marxist guerrillas that plagued 
venezuela in the early 60s led venezuela to break relations with 
havana 
i dont quite understand the reasons for inviting castro to the 
ceremonies i must express my personal dissatisfaction for inviting 
a dictator who in 30 years has done nothing but trample cubans 
human rights said monsignor jorge urosa sabino the caracas 
auxiliary bishop during a homily saturday at a mass commemorating 
136 years of the birth of cuban hero jose marti 
as president for the first time between 1974 and 1979 perez 
restored relations with cuba but diplomatic normalcy between both 
countries did not last long 
in 1980 they were on the brink of a total rupture again after a 
venezuelan military court acquitted anticastro leaders suspected of 
blowing up a cubana de aviacion jetliner in 1976 
rightist deputy vladimir gessen of the democratic new generation 
party also protested castros visit 
the caribbean dictator may have had some achievements but also 
hitler mussolini stalin and pinochet had some and it is not a 
justification for their crimes he said in a fullpage 
advertisement in the newspaper el nacional on sunday

the jury deciding the fate of joel steinberg 
accused of murdering his illegally adopted daughter finished its 
seventh day of deliberations sunday after asking for a clarification 
on a lesser charge 
deliberations resumed about 1115 am after some jurors attended 
church services the jury retired sunday night without reaching a 
verdict and planned to reconvene monday morning 
steinberg 47 is accused of fatally beating lisa steinberg the 
6yearold girl he and his livein companion hedda nussbaum had 
illegally obtained at birth 
just after 5 pm sunday the jury sent out its second note 
asking for legal definitions relating to lesser charges the jury 
asked for a clarification of the definition of intent and 
serious physical injury which are elements of the lesser charge 
of manslaughter 
the note also asked if there was no apparent intention to 
cause injury but the acts resulted in serious physical injury 
nonetheless would that be grounds to conclude intent as spelled out 
by law 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax instructed jurors 
several times not to consider manslaughter unless they unanimously 
acquitted steinberg of the most serious charge seconddegree murder 
steinberg a disbarred lawyer faces four charges seconddegree 
murder firstdegree manslaughter seconddegree manslaughter and 
criminally negligent homicide 
a similar note from the jurors saturday prompted one of 
steinbergs lawyers to suggest the jurors had acquitted his client 
of murder and moved on to the second count 
i cant say its a strong indication it does not mean theyve 
acquitted him of murder two but its an indication said ira 
london 
the murder charge carries a maximum penalty of 25 years to life 
in prison other maximum penalties are firstdegree manslaughter 
up to 15 years seconddegree manslaughter up to 15 years 
criminally negligent homicide up to 4 years

after months of anger and uncertainty a 
strike deadline looms at midnight tuesday for 1700 appalachian coal 
miners who have been on the job for pittston coal group inc with no 
contract 
in recent days pittston and the united mine workers adopted a 
conciliatory tone for the first time in the yearlong dispute even 
though neither side would predict that continuing talks might avert 
a walkout in virginia west virginia and kentucky 
the umw issued statements last week that mentioned areas of 
agreement pittston president michael odom said over the weekend 
that the two sides were in substantial agreement on much of new 
contract although a halfdozen key sticking points remained 
they met again sunday in washington to continue going over fine 
points of a contract offer the union made tuesday in response to a 
company offer made nov 9 company and union officials said 
pittston and the union planned another bargaining session monday 
odom said sunday night 
on saturday the governors of the three states said they had 
asked umw president richard trumka and the chairman of pittstons 
parent company the pittston co paul douglas to try and avert a 
strike possibly by taking 30 to 60 days for each side to cool off 
were in total agreement with the governors that a strike is 
senseless to their constituents and communities and the business 
climate of the coal community odom said from his abingdon home 
noting that the governors had asked the union for an immediate 
reply odom said i hoped they would have responded sooner 
umw spokesman joe corcoran said saturday that before any decision 
on putting off a strike would be made trumka would have to confer 
with international union officers and elected district and local 
officials 
as we speak theres a lot of momentum and people are preparing 
for a strike corcoran said from his home in silver spring md 
people are getting assignments and meetings are being set up 
corcoran said top union officials will probably meet monday to 
discuss the governors request 
the labor dispute began last winter when the companies of the 
bituminous coal operators association agreed on a new contract with 
miners for the second time in a row with no strike pittston had 
dropped out of the the industry association saying its business was 
different from other major eastern producers and it required a 
different type of contract 
this company mines thin deep metallurgical coal seams that 
compete predominantly in the export market odom said that 
market is not protected by longterm price contracts every year 
you have to compete with the world competition 
other major eastern coal producers enjoy longterm contracts with 
domestic utilities he said 
miners agreed to stay on the job with no contract after last feb 
1 but each side repeatedly accused the other of hindering progress 
in the contract talks 
the umw took miners off the job for a fourday memorial 
period and then a sixday memorial period 
pittston cut off health benefits to some 1500 retirees widows 
and disabled miners saying the benefits would have to be addressed 
in a new contract several scattered wildcat strikes in virginia and 
west virginia were believed spurred by retirees who set up picket 
lines company and union officials said 
pittston has vowed to operate through a strike and has advertised 
for permanent replacement miners 
new york analysts who follow the coal industry said last week 
that the company will be able to operate through a strike although 
it might take several months to get up to full capacity 
but the umw has two unfair labor practices complaints pending 
with the national labor relations board and if the nlrb rules in 
favor of the union umw vice president cecil roberts said miners 
can strike in protest without fear of being permanently replaced

about 200 people demonstrated sunday outside a 
federal detention center to protest the treatment of haitian 
immigrants held there 
inside the gates of the immigration services krome avenue 
detention center several dozen federal officers stood in closed 
ranks wearing shields helmets clubs and body armor 
we come for peace and theyre ready for war said ray 
fauntroy president of dade county chapter of the southern christian 
leadership conference 
the protesters were primarily haitians they carried placards 
saying fight racism justice for black people and one black 
is hurt all are hurt 
the haitians say people from their homeland are more likely to be 
held for deportation than are white immigrants 
immigration officials have maintained that most haitians entering 
the united states are not eligible for asylum because they are 
seeking economic refuge and not fleeing political persecution 
the detention center which is housing about 300 haitians was 
placed under a modified lockdown severely restricting the movement 
of detainees in preparation for the demonstration officials said 
immigration and naturalization service district director perry 
rivkind acknowledged earlier this month that the detention center 
became seriously overcrowded with the arrival of 94 haitians picked 
up after their homemade sailboat ran aground in the florida keys 
the more people at krome the longer they have to wait in line 
for food and other things the opportunity for protests and tension 
grows rivkind said 
betty ferguson one of the speakers at the rally mentioned the 
riotready officers behind the fence some of whom were armed 
when they are ready to shoot us down like dogs then that means 
they know we are right she said we are only asking equal 
treatment for haitians 
if they treat us like this and were in the outside how do you 
think theyre treating them on the inside she asked 
the demonstration was sponsored by the haitian organization 
veyeyo its members distributed leaflets listing the groups aims 
equal treatment for black refugees freedom for the haitians at 
krome and other installations around the nation and no support for 
any haitian government linked to ousted dictator jeanclaude 
duvalier 
rev gerard jeanjuste director of the haitian refugee center 
was among those in the crowd we want equal treatment he said 
the nicaraguans dont come here to krome the cubans dont stay 
too long

a cuban official has disclosed that 270000 soviet 
and cuban troops were ready to go to war with the united states 
during the 1962 cuban missile crisis and that 100000 casualties 
were expected former us defense secretary robert mcnamara said 
sunday 
a soviet general confirmed for the first time that onethird of 
his countrys nuclear warheads designed to strike the united states 
were on cuba at the time however he and another soviet official 
said the warheads had not been mounted on missile launchers and were 
not ready for firing 
also cuban leader fidel castro urged moscow to launch a nuclear 
attack on the united states abc news reported 
the revelations came during a review of the cuban missile crisis 
at a conference during the weekend at a trade union center in 
southwest moscow 
pierre salinger kennedys former press secretary a conference 
participant and now an abc correspondent on sunday quoted a top 
soviet source as saying in a private conversation that on oct 27 
1962 castro urged khrushchev to immediately fire the missiles at 
the united states to head off an invasion 
the new york times had a similiar report on monday and quoted 
unnamed americans as saying the report originated with sergei 
khruschev son of the former soviet premier nikita s khrushchev it 
said sergei khruschev subsequently denied making the comment 
the report that castro had urged the use of nuclear weapons also 
was denied by aleksandr i alekseyev soviet ambassador to cuba in 
1962 
soviets and americans have met before to discuss the soviet 
deployment of nuclear missiles in cuba and the us response a 
blockade of the island and a demand for the rockets removal 
but this was the first joint meeting with cuban officials who 
guided their country through the crisis nikita khrushchev 
eventually withdrew the missiles in exchange for president kennedys 
pledge not to invade cuba 
at a news conference wrapping up the conference sunday mcnamara 
said the figures on cubas war readiness and casualty estimate were 
provided by jorge risquet a member of cubas ruling politburo 
they say they had armed 270000 men they were determined to 
fight to the death of every man and they believed there would be 
100000 cuban and soviet casualties mcnamara told reporters 
it was not clear whether the 100000 casualty estimate included 
deaths and injuries and whether it referred to losses among soldiers 
and civilians 
other american officials said privately the cubans had said the 
casualty count could have reached 800000 cubas population at the 
time was 8 million 
mcnamara said that of the troops 40000 were soviet four times 
higher than us intelligence estimates at the time 
risquet cited the figures to show his country seriously believed 
that a us invasion of his island was imminent mcnamara said no 
such invasion was ever contemplated but speaking of the cubans he 
added if i had been in their shoes i would have believed the 
same thing 
american officials have said they were never sure whether any 
soviet nuclear warheads had actually reached cuba but that they 
assumed they had 
col gen dmitri a volkogonov director of the defense 
ministrys institute of military history said that at the time of 
the crisis 20 soviet nuclear warheads were on cuba another 20 
warheads were headed to the island aboard a soviet ship that was 
caught in the us naval blockade he said 
volkogonov said he got the figures from military archives 
he made the remarks in a closed session of the conference 
saturday and they were reported to the associated press on sunday 
by raymond garthoff a state department official at the time of the 
crisis 
garthoff now a senior fellow at the brookings institution in 
washington said volkogonov reported 20 nuclear missiles were on 
soviet territory targeted at the united states 
the total stockpile of soviet nuclear warheads designed to fire 
on the united states at that time was 60 garthoff quoted volkogonov 
as saying 
soviet officials had previously been evasive about whether 
nuclear warheads had actually reached cuba according to garthoff 
in his memoirs however khrushchev implied that at the time of 
the crisis the soviets were ready to deliver a nuclear strike from 
cuba 
at sundays news conference the soviet ambassador to washington 
during the crisis anatoly f dobrynin said he didnt know at the 
time that soviet warheads were already on cuba 
volkogonov said the warheads were not ready for firing and 
viktor g komplektov a deputy soviet foreign minister said their 
presence on cuba did not mean they would be put on launchers in 
preparation for a nuclear strike 
at no time not before not during the beginning of the crisis 
or in the most acute moments of the crisis neither from the soviet 
command there in cuba nor in moscow was there or could there have 
been an order to mount nuclear warheads on the missiles 
komplektov told reporters he said not one of the missiles was 
ready and targeted at the united states

the boeing co which has been troubled by delays 
in delivering its new 747400 jumbo jet plans to produce 57 747 
jetliners in 1989 most of them in the second half of the year 
the number was about what aerospace industry analysts had 
predicted even before boeing was forced to rework its delivery 
schedule 
boeing has said that problems with wiring and parts availability 
delays in certification and an overly ambitious development and 
production plan resulted in the delivery schedule being pushed back 
three times in four months 
the first model400 was delivered thursday to northwest airlines 
a month behind schedule 
although we regret having to revise delivery schedules it is 
most important to meet our traditional standards of quality and our 
customers high expectations for boeing airplanes boeing 
commercial airplanes president dean thornton said friday in a news 
release 
company spokesman david jimenez said the 57 projected deliveries 
include all current models of 747s but that the rescheduling 
primarily involves the model400 which will make up a majority of 
the new planes 
delivery was to start in 1988 and go into 1989 with the 
concentration of deliveries in the first half of the year jimenez 
said now the concentration will be in the last half of 1989 and 
extend to early 1990 
a good part will take place at the end of the year but were 
not going into specifics 
the new 747400 the worlds largest commercial jet is capable 
of carrying 412 passengers 8400 miles nonstop and up to 624 
passengers on shortrange flights the plane has been extensively 
redisigned with a computerized cockpit that uses video display 
screens to replace more than 600 lights gauges and switches the 
plane can be flown by a crew of two instead of the three needed on 
earlier 747s 
boeing currently is producing about four 747s a month and plans 
to increase production to about five per month by mid1989 it had 
hoped to deliver 31 747s in 1988 but actually delivered 24 
in briefings with reporters last week phil condit commercial 
airplanes executive vice president for engineering and production 
declined to say what if any penalties boeing would have to pay for 
being late with the new 747s which sell for approximately 125 
million each 
boeing announced in october that it would be about one month late 
with the first 20 747400s in december deliveries were pushed back 
further because of delays in getting federal aviation administration 
certification earlier this month boeing said it was once again 
reviewing its delivery schedule 
bill whitlow an analyst with dain bosworth co in seattle said 
the announcement was with the production range orignally expected 
theyre saying theyre quite confident theyll be back on track 
at some point during the year and in terms of what the stock market 
sees its a nonevent because they had been projecting between 55 
and 65 planes for the year he said 
he said that while some of the deliveries may slide into 1990 
the net number of planes delivered in 1989 will not change boeing 
books payment for its aircraft upon delivery 
les childress an analyst with harper mclean amp co in seattle 
was taking more of a waitandsee attitude 
boeing says that itll deliver 57 planes but saying that and 
doing it are two different things he said theyre telling 
people they have their problems solved but im not so sure they can 
achieve that

audi the west german luxury automaker is 
trying to repair its dented image with dealers following the furor 
over sudden acceleration by some of its cars but whether the firm 
is succeeding is a matter of opinion 
audi executives heard from their dealers in a closed meeting 
sunday during the national automobile dealers association 
convention and there was less rancor at this gathering than at last 
years session said richard mugg vice president in charge of audi 
of america 
charges surfaced a few years ago that audi 5000s automobiles 
would accelerate without warning consumer groups suggested the 
problem was in the cars design but the company said drivers 
stepping on the accelerator instead of the brake were to blame 
audi recalled the cars to install a device that prevents the 
transmission from being shifted without applying the brake since 
then the federal government has received sudden acceleration 
complaints from owners of a variety of other cars 
we have a better understanding of each other mugg said after 
meeting with the dealers last year at this time unintended 
acceleration was the major problem and weve put that behind us 
but audi dealer ray green of jacksonville ill disagreed 
they still havent overcome the stigma of sudden 
acceleration he said if the controversy hadnt happened green 
added i would predict audi would be selling more cars today 
audi sales took a beating during 1988 falling 45 percent from 
1987 levels recently audi sales have begun creeping back toward 
yearago figures the company also has stopped selling the 
5000series cars in the united states 
we had a difficult year phasing out our volume car the 5000 
and replacing it with the 100 and 200 mugg said 
he added that in the middle of next month audi will begin an 
image rebuilding campaign with the public and its dealers 
meanwhile green who also is a toyota dealer said the japanese 
company made a mistake by requiring a separate dealership for its 
new lexus line of luxury cars 
in my opinion not letting the toyota dealers have that 
franchise is a big mistake he said adding that the company may 
change its mind after lexus dealerships are in operation for a few 
years 
when they see these dealers not making a profit they will give 
the dealers an entrylevel vehicle green predicted 
the lexus scheduled to go on sale this fall varies in cost from 
20000 to 40000 it is aimed at buyers ready for luxury cars but 
unwilling to pay more for european imports

texas eastern corps board of directors 
unanimously rejected sunday a 26 billion cash offer from coastal 
corp calling it clearly inadequate 
coastal announced jan 16 it was making a cash tender offer of 
42 per share for all of texas easterns outstanding common shares 
since then texas easterns stock has soared closing friday at 48 
a share 
the tender offer is set to expire on feb 14 
in a special board of directors meeting sunday texas easterns 
board was told by financial advisers they should wait for a better 
offer 
dennis r hendrix texas eastens president said coastals offer 
is clearly inadequate he said the boards action are designed 
to protect shareholders from pressure tactics designed to stampede 
them into a decision before they can service a better offer 
hendrix added that the boards decision in no way prevents 
coastal from raising its bid 
if theres only one shortfused bid on the table shareholders 
dont have a choice hendrix said in a prepared statement they 
have an ultimatum it may be more than what they had but we dont 
believe it is the best they can get 
coastals president james r paul said in a statement its 
obvious that after two weeks texas eastern still does not have a 
better offer than coastals 42 a share 
he said coastal plans to respond and make further comment after 
reviewing documents that texas eastern indicated it would file 
monday with the securities and exchange commission 
in a court hearing last week in houston texas eastern officials 
said the company might use a white knight to block the coastal 
bid and had a list of more than 50 possible buyers 
coastal officials later suggested that the comment was designed 
to inflate stock prices and make their offer appear inadequate 
paul has said coastal has asked texas eastern for information 
that would justify a higher offer but said the only response has 
been rhetoric and a stonewall meeting last sunday paul met with 
texas easterns board last weekend 
analysts have said they doubt that there may be a large number of 
serious contenders to take over texas eastern a houstonbased 
natural gas company 
houstonbased enron corp which operates the nations largest 
natural gas transmission system and long had been considered a 
possible candidate for a texas eastern takeover will not say 
whether it is talking to the company 
during the court hearing before us district judge lynn n 
hughes the judge denied a texas eastern request to delay a feb 7 
hearing date in a coastal lawsuit desinged to prevent texas eastern 
from using antitakeover measures
