driftnets meant to catch tuna and squid are 
sweeping up and killing huge numbers of other fish and birds that 
are just thrown away the leaders of a greenpeace foundation 
protest voyage said thursday 
in a news conference following the return of the rainbow warrior 
from a pacific voyage expedition leader ben deeble said the crew 
had found at least 30 species of dolphins birds and fish dead or 
dying in the huge driftnets 
shark alone accounted for 30 percent of the catch in one net 
deeble said 
generally they cut the fins off the sharks and throw the rest 
away said roger grace of auckland new zealand an underwater 
photographer on the mission 
pomfret a small but tasty fish is thrown away by the 
thousands grace said 
the group plans to use videotapes and photographs of marine life 
caught in a plastic monofilament mesh and a 3mile driftnet that it 
seized to campaign for tougher sanctions by the united states and 
united nations against driftnet fishing 
i think the video is the most complete ever shot of the 
driftnet fleet grace said 
deeble said the rainbow warrior crew saw or monitored on radar 
about 200 of the more than 1000 driftnet vessels from japan 
taiwan and korea believed to be operating in the north pacific 
he said plans were being made to unfurl the seized net in the 
downtown area of a us city a process he said would require about 
200 people 
i think thats one reason weve had so much trouble getting 
these driftnets banned he said people cant comprehend the 
size of these things 
the rainbow warrior a 181foot converted trawler departed july 
19 from hawaii with 32 people on a sixweek mission covering more 
than 6000 miles to monitor and protest driftnet fishing for tuna 
and squid 
the nets hang like a curtain more than 30 feet below the surface 
and stretch as far as 35 miles critics say they indiscriminately 
trap and kill fish thousands of marine mammals and 800000 birds a 
year 
at times the protesters brought inflatable motorized launches 
close enough to the fishing vessels to see the faces of the crew 
deeble said 
he said he was invited aboard a taiwanese ship and had dinner 
with the skipper 
it was a very sociable meeting where we discussed our views on 
driftnets deeble said hes looking at changing his technology 
changing to long lines to fish for tuna 
the skipper claimed he caught no whales and rarely found marine 
mammals or birds in the nets although those aboard the rainbow 
warrior saw dolphins and many birds being hauled aboard deeble 
said 
a federal judge in san francisco on tuesday ordered a ban on 
imports of tuna caught by five nations until they can show that 
they are not killing more dolphins than us law allows 
us district judge thelton henderson said the bush 
administration had given foreign fleets too much time to comply 
with a 1988 federal law requiring an embargo of any nation whose 
dolphinkilling rate was more than twice the rate of the us tuna 
fleet 
some commercial fishing fleets deliberately drop their nets on 
dolphins which swim above yellowfin tuna

leaders of a capitol rally thursday demanded 
that the governor and legislature decriminalize drugs as suggested 
in an advisory panel report parts of which were barred from 
publication by the attorney general 
its censorship and he has the nerve to call himself a 
liberal shouted rally coordinator richard geiselhart we dont 
need a war on drugs we need a war on greed corruption waste and 
stupidity but above all we need a war on hypocrisy 
regina birdsell a spokeswoman for attorney general john van de 
kamp denied the allegation of censorship she said recommendations 
of decriminalization were deleted because they were contained in 
individual members statements and not in a collective panel 
opinion 
the sevenmember commission was created by the legislature to 
study drug abuse and possible remedies birdsell said its report 
explains where people can write for the individual panel members 
opinions she said 
panel members said they recommended that the legislature 
legalize cultivation of marijuana for personal use consider 
decriminalization of other drugs on an individual basis and 
legalize possession of hypodermic needles 
the state panel said current antidrug laws have been 
manifestly unsuccessful in that we are now using more and a 
greater variety of drugs legal and illegal 
many of the 300 people who flocked to the noon rally outside the 
state capitol sported long hair and the tiedyed look of the 1960s 
marijuana smoke wafted through the crowd 
speakers from the national organization to reform marijuana laws 
and other groups said laws against drugs are unconstitutional and 
do more harm than good 
eric garris of mountain view a republican candidate for the 
state assembly drew a huge cheer from the crowd when he said he 
was running for office on a platform of decriminalizing drugs 
all the money time and energy we spend on this 
unconstitutional unworkable hypocrisy via law enforcement courts 
and prisons should be spent to help take the despair out of 
peoples lives through education job training jobs affordable 
housing and medical care geiselhart said 
a large federal raid of marijuana plantations in the mountains 
180 miles northeast of san francisco last month drew criticism from 
many local officials who said it achieved little other than to 
anger residents who said they were mernaced by army troops toting 
automatic weapons

the energy departments more than 12000 cars and trucks were 
directed thursday to begin buying alcoholblended fuels in an 
experiment to measure fuel savings

a backtoschool quiz what lunch box 
fixture will be history in school lunchrooms across maine 
answer the juice box that softsided singleserving 
container the legislature has outlawed it because the bonded 
layers of plastic paper and aluminum that keep the contents fresh 
defy recycling 
maines unique ban on sale of most beverages in aseptic 
packaging takes effect saturday just as children prepare to return 
to school and parents think about what to pack in their kids lunch 
boxes 
while the timing of the law was by all accounts coincidental 
it has left parents scrambling to replace the drinks packed in 
convenient 8ounce containers that come with straws 
i dont know what were going to do said linda ball of 
portland as her 3yearold son billy selected a threepack of 
fruit juice at a supermarket those glass things she said 
pointing to a nearby display of singleserving juice bottles 
were afraid theyll hurt his teeth 
still ms ball and other parents who stocked up on the popular 
juice boxes before the ban took effect indicated they were prepared 
to sacrifice convenience in order to counter the states buildup of 
solid waste 
im concerned about the environment so ill make do with 
something else if its that much of a problem she said 
supermarkets say they will no longer have the same variety of 
fruit juices and punches available cans or bottles take up more 
shelf space and have higher handling costs than brick packs of 
boxes 
we estimate that its going to cost consumers in maine about 
17 cents more per unit for each single item they purchase said 
margaret mcewen consumer information director at shaws 
supermarkets 
juice boxes have surged in popularity since they were introduced 
to american supermarkets in the early 1980s their advantages are 
obvious less weight unbreakable safer than metal or glass easy 
to stash in backpacks and lunch boxes and easily crushed and 
discarded 
but juice boxes have become a prime target of environmentalists 
because they replace containers that can be recycled easily with 
current technology observed jeanne wirka of the environmental 
action foundation in washington dc 
maine with a goal of recycling half its solid waste by 1994 
banned the boxes in an expansion of a law enacted more than a 
decade ago to require deposits on bottles and cans of soda and beer 
the revised law made all beverage containers except those used 
for dairy products subject to deposits liquor bottles came under 
the law last january wine bottles become returnable on saturday 
and all other noncarbonated beverages will require deposits by 
years end 
the only brick packs permitted under the new law are those that 
contain milk products or juice concentrates 
tetra pak inc the company that pioneered aseptic 
packaging says juice boxes are environmentally sound because they 
are lighter and smaller than bottles and cans 
we have so much less material in our packages that it creates 
a lot less waste said edward klein tetra paks vice president 
for environmental affairs 
juice boxes remain legal in the other 49 states lawmakers in 
massachusetts and vermont last year rejected bans rhode island 
took a different tack enacting a bill that requires the aseptic 
packaging industry to work with the state to develop a pilot 
recycling program 
recycling projects also are under way in massachusetts new york 
and canada as well as in rhode island klein said 
sharon treat of the natural resources council which fought to 
include the ban in maines law expressed skepticism about such 
pilot projects saying they turn out a compound for which there may 
be only limited demand

labor unrest is growing in brazil and 
acquiring a tone of violence and sabotage that could threaten the 
governments ambitious antiinflation program 
if his members continue to lose buying power said union leader 
vicente paulo da silva the result might be a major social 
convulsion with unpredictable consequences 
in late july hundreds of auto workers went on a threeday 
rampage at the sao paulo subsidiary of ford motor co where a 
strike shut down production for more than a month they destroyed 
more than 50 cars smashed windows and doors and set fires in the 
plant administration buildings 
a strike by power workers this month caused a 10hour blackout 
in brasilia the capital and shut off electricity for two hours in 
the northeastern state of bahia in brasilia the lights went out 
in government ministries and the residence of president fernando 
collor de mello 
ozires silva infrastructure minister of the national 
government told reporters signs of sabotage were found at 
power stations and authorities might sue the power workers union 
for damages 
labor leaders say the violence is a sign of rebellion against 
the pay restrictions collors government contends are vital to its 
antiinflation plan 
the incidents at ford were merely a sign of the future 
violence that could erupt as a result of the workers despair da 
silva president of the sao bernardo do campo metalworkers union 
said in an interview their wages are not enough to feed clothe 
educate or house their children decently 
most foreignowned auto plants are in sao bernardo do campo an 
industrial suburb of sao paulo brazils financial center and 
largest city da silvas union which says it represents 140000 
workers is considered brazils most militant and politicized 
da silva said the government was trying to control inflation 
by provoking recession and unemployment and slashing our 
purchasing power 
more than 500 strikes have occurred since collor announced a 
radical austerity program march 16 one day after taking office 
aimed at reducing annual inflation of nearly 5000 percent 
his plan included an 18month freeze on savings and money market 
accounts elimination of subsidies and incentives the sale of 
government mansions and cars and mass layoffs of public employees 
inflation came down from nearly 100 percent a month to about 11 
percent in july but the economy headed toward recession and 
unemployment soared 
the brazilian institute of geography and statistics said nearly 
1 million employees of private companies had lost their jobs since 
march 16 and more than 100000 federal employees had been dismissed 
industrial output dropped 71 percent during the first six 
months of 1990 said the institute whose statistics the government 
considers official 
in may collors government ended automatic costofliving wage 
adjustments and said workers must negotiate pay raises with 
employers indexed pay increases had been a traditional brazilian 
hedge against inflation 
hundreds of thousands of workers have gone on strike in an 
effort to recover at least part of the purchasing power lost to 
inflation 
labor leaders want raises of more than 100 percent for their 
members to compensate for the wild inflation before mar 16 
these losses must be replaced in the workers paycheck da 
silva said then we could negotiate real wage hikes based on 
productivity 
the government must adopt a wage policy that guarantees wages 
will be adjusted to inflation 
collor said in a radio interview he would veto any congressional 
attempt to reinstate automatic wage adjustments because they would 
plunge brazil back into a hyperinflationary spiral 
workers interviewed by the associated press said raises obtained 
through negotiations had not closed the gap 
josemar de medeiros a 30yearold maintenance worker at ford 
got a 59 percent raise after the strike and earns the equivalent of 
915 a month that is excellent pay in brazil where the monthly 
minimum wage is about 62 
this salary makes me a member of the elite of brazils work 
force yet i cant buy new clothes for my children cant pay a 
daycare center can barely pay the rent for a cramped twobedroom 
apartment and cant even dream of buying what i help produce 
medeiros said 
millions of lowerpaid workers are in serious trouble he said 
and told a reporter our purchasing power is declining day by day 
and we are angry if this situation continues the wave of strikes 
will certainly grow 
some economists are puzzled by the widespread labor trouble 
during a recession they say workers usually are more concerned 
with keeping their jobs than getting more pay 
da silvas response workers are fed up with footing the bill 
for economic stabilization programs the mass dismissals and the 
loss in purchasing power prove the collor government lied when it 
said its austerity program would not sacrifice the working class 
today the worker feels he has nothing to lose except his fear 
of getting fired and hes losing that rapidly

the serial killings in gainesville fla 
recall the terror that gripped californians during the night 
stalker murders a reign that ended five years ago today 
on aug 31 1985 texas drifter richard ramirez was captured by 
an angry mob that recognized him from news photos capping a summer 
of random nocturnal attacks 
the grisly string of satanic crimes still haunts the legal 
system and those who became entwined in one of the most complex 
prosecutions ever 
its not over people think because theyre not reading it in 
the paper anymore that its over said deputy district attorney 
p philip halpin whose career became captive to the ramirez case 
there will be many more anniversaries before this case reaches 
its resolution unfortunately 
the appeal process has just begun for the 30yearold ramirez 
convicted of 13 murders and 30 felonies ramirez also faces trial 
soon in san francisco in a single slaying there 
in spite of winning ramirezs conviction and death sentence last 
september halpin remains assigned to the case fulltime he works 
in an office filled with transcripts of marathon court proceedings 
for use in the appeal which is automatic in deathpenalty cases 
how long will it take to resolve the appeal were talking 
years said halpin 
ramirez is being held in the county jail in san francisco where 
deputy district attorney eugene sweeters said he hasnt caused 
any trouble there as far as i know 
ramirezs reign of terror ended when east los angeles residents 
captured him after he tried to pull a woman from her car by the 
time police arrived a crowd was shouting kill him kill him 
officers formed a human chain to protect ramirez from the mob 
residents said the night stalker held all of them captive 
throughout that steamy summer when they kept windows and doors shut 
tight in fear 
as in the gainesville slayings it was through unlocked windows 
and doors that the stalker entered homes he raped killed and 
mutilated his victims 
a womans eyes were gouged out after she was killed by the 
night stalker a man was murdered in his bed and his wife was 
raped beside the dead body 
there were signs of devil worship a pentagram drawn on the 
wall at one murder scene and survivors accounts of being ordered 
to swear to satan 
a preliminary hearing in 1986 disclosed the horror of the 
victims ordeals and resulted in witnessstand identifications of 
ramirez as the killer 
legal maneuvers by a series of defense attorneys delayed 
ramirezs trial a succession of judges presided before superior 
court judge michael tynan took charge and saw the case through a 
yearlong trial 
at the very end a juror was slain during deliberations defense 
lawyers sought a mistrial but the judge ruled the killing in a 
domestic dispute was unrelated to the case and ordered jurors to 
proceed they recommended the death penalty which tynan imposed 
ramirez passed up the opportunity to testify preventing 
hopedfor glimpses of the killers mind and motivation he chose to 
remain a mystery spouting slogans of devilworship 
i am beyond good and evil i will be avenged lucifer dwells 
in us all thats it ramirez said before he was led off to 
prison 
halpin said he has concluded the serial killer was really a 
smalltime burglar out of control 
he noted that ramirez failed to fit the usual serial killer 
profile of someone who always kills with the same weapon and whose 
victims are similar 
halpin suggested that investigators in the gainesville case may 
be facing problems similar to those that stymied the night 
stalker task force for months 
frankly law enforcement wasnt ready for a night stalker 
said halpin every study of serial murderers led to conclusions 
that didnt apply to this case

militant attitudes may be the new fashion 
for many americans but townsfolk here are chewing over a proposal 
to muzzle fighting words on the streets of this college enclave 
the proposal designed to silence racial slurs is part of a 
long line of efforts to promote harmony in a town that has voted 
against every war since 1812 it is already drawing fire from civil 
rights advocates 
this is a caring community its a community of people who 
really have some deep and genuine humane values said paul 
rogers a member of the citizens review committee which has 
written a first draft of the bylaw 
rogers said hes not sure whether the proposal will succeed it 
was inspired by an incident last may in which a white youth 
reportedly shouted racial slurs and knocked a black teenager down 
in amherst a town of about 34000 where residents have marched 
for peace and against war scores of times debating constitutional 
rights is nothing new 
a university of massachusetts at amherst sociology professor 
credited the nature of amherst politics to oldfashioned yankee 
outspokenness at regular and wellattended town meetings and having 
two colleges and the university 
these are people who are familiar with the use of the tongue 
in a situation politically which puts a premium on it said jay 
demerath 
in keeping with tradition a group of residents this month 
marched to the town common to protest us military buildup in 
saudi arabia and suggest that president bush turn to alternate 
methods to resolve the invasion of kuwait 
two years ago a group of senior citizens staged a sitin at the 
university of massachusetts chancellors office to protest research 
on the anthrax disease that they feared could somehow be put to 
militaristic use 
the proposal doesnt give a list of fighting words it 
defines them as those that by their very utterance inflict injury 
upon the person or group of persons to whom they are directed or 
which tend to incite an immediate breach of peace 
john roberts head of the civil liberties union in boston said 
the proposal is a bad idea 
obviously its wellintentioned he said noting that racial 
harassment is on the rise it is ugly and you want to deal with 
it i think this is not a way to deal with it 
rogers said the bylaw doesnt apply to expression of ideas but 
rather to certain offensive forms of speech he likened prosecution 
for shouting racial slurs to a people who get too raucous at a 
latenight party 
if we can regulate hooting and hollering and whistling we can 
certainly regulate these kinds of words that are not protected by 
the constitution he said i know people are going to be 
concerned about protecting free speech and they ought to be 
the proposal may go before a town meeting this fall if it gets 
approval from town counsel alan seewald who declined comment on 
the bylaw thursday 
the bylaws wording comes from a 1942 supreme court case 
chaplinsky vs new hampshire in which a state law prohibiting use 
of fighting words was upheld rogers said in that case a 
selectman had referred to a man as a damn fascist he said 
but roberts said that case applies to specific confrontations 
which are already prohibited under civil rights statutes 
i think theyre going to be in trouble he said

few nightclub comics have the nerve to 
jump off the stage and snatch a steak from a fan at a frontrow 
table 
winston the wonder dog did 
winstons routine was not sophisticated dog acts rarely are 
but his impression of barbara bush was a crowd pleaser and 
audiences roared when he lay on his back and punched the air with 
boxing gloveclad feet 
the old english sheepdog who traveled the nations comedy clubs 
and college campuses for six years died at wednesday at age 11 
he was the straight guy and i just had to make whatever he 
did funny seattle comedian earl burks said thursday as he 
prepared for his first show since winstons death 
winston was humanely destroyed by a henderson veterinarian after 
suffering symptoms of old age that forced his retirement four 
months ago and worsened steadily since burks said a younger 
sheepdog took over winstons act 
winston the wonder dog performed in las vegas 47 states and 
canada where he once spent a night in jail and entertained the 
local police burks said 
the dogs photograph appeared in rolling stone and people 
magazine and dozens of local newspapers he was on the nationally 
televised show star search 
winstons talents included dancing on his hind legs and 
answering questions such as whats the top of a house 
called answer roof 
it was just real stupid but it was funny burks said 
sometimes when he would bark into the microphone he would just 
keep on and on because he could hear himself it was so goofy that 
people would laugh 
with a wardrobe of wigs sunglasses and masks winston also 
impersonated the political personalities of the day including the 
ayatollah khomeini and the first lady and celebrities such as 
sammy davis jr stevie wonder and zsa zsa gabor 
the shaggy grayandwhite dogs large pliable mouth leant 
itself to manipulation by burks whose humor sometimes took a bawdy 
turn 
burks bought winston as a puppy when he needed material to fill 
time at a comedy club someone suggested he take his pet on stage 
there was a guy at a front table with a big steak burks 
said i turned my back and he was up on this guys table eating 
this steak they were laughing and applauding and i was thinking 
oh no im gonna get sued

the families of some american oil workers trapped 
in iraq or kuwait have another worry a company says it cant 
afford to keep paying their salaries 
at least six contract workers for the oge drilling inc remain 
in kuwait or iraq ten other workers and their dependents left 
according to tb obrien president of obrien goins simpson 
inc in midland oge drilling is its houston subsidiary 
youve got to understand were not a big company obrien 
said thursday essentially 90 percent of its income and business 
is business in kuwait now its not a company that company is 
broke because we are out about 470000 that hasnt been paid to 
us 
oge provided drilling supervisors and superintentents to kuwait 
oil co and kuwait national petroleum co for 10 years both 
companies were owned by the goverment of kuwait which was 
dissolved after iraq invaded the neighboring country on aug 2 
our contract with these people terminated when our contract 
with kuwait oil company terminated obrien said thats just 
the way the contract was written and the company doesnt have any 
money to pay them 
he said if the company tried to absorb the loss soon it 
wouldnt be able to pay the stranded workers or its other 40 
employees 
its not by our choice that any of them were there we have a 
number of them who used good judgment to get out and a number used 
poor judgment to stay and two got captured and didnt have any 
choice in the matter 
obrien said the stranded workers included people from texas 
louisiana and canada two were taken to baghdad and four plus a 
workers wife are believed to have remained in kuwait 
obrien said his company is going directly to kuwait petroleum 
co which has set up operations in london to try to get its 
payment he also is seeking guidance from the texas employment 
commission in hopes of getting the workers unemployment benefits 
from the state 
bill grossenbacher of the texas employment commission said the 
state has asked for information on the workers and will examine 
each case 
there may be a way we could interpret our laws so some of 
these individuals could qualify if so we would mail their checks 
to their families he said from austin 
the checks would amount to no more than 214 per week 
that wouldnt even begin to touch our responsibilities said 
patricia hale of nearby spring whose husband edward is being 
held i really dont know yet what im going to do i have no 
other income 
donnita cole of odessa whose husband john is a captive said 
214 wont even pay my telephone bill 
i just cant believe they would do this to us i never heard 
of a company that would do this to dependents she said my 
husband did not quit and did not get laid off so theres no need 
to call the texas employment commission

pope john paul ii arrives 
saturday on the start of a fournation african tour to be climaxed 
by the blessing of a huge costly and controversial basilica in 
ivory coast 
the trip which will take the pope across the bulge of the 
continent will be his 49th foreign tour and his seventh visit to 
africa where declining economies and rapidly rising populations 
spell misery for millions 
as in previous visits the pope is expected to call for 
christian harmony and preach against artificial birth control and 
extramarital sex with its attendant threat of aids a particularly 
deadly scourge in africa 
the world health organization estimates 5 million subsaharan 
africans are infected with the virus that can cause the disease 
that is double the number three years ago 
pope john paul will carry his messages from dar es salaam to 
three other major cities in tanzania an east africa nation of 
about 23 million people most of them are moslems about 20 percent 
of tanzanians subscribe to the roman catholic faith 
after five days in tanzania he will fly to burundi and rwanda 
tiny neighboring and predominantly catholic countries to the 
northwest they are the most densly populated nations in africa and 
their recent history has been marked by clashes between their two 
main ethnic groups the hutus and the tutsis 
the pope will spend two nights each in burundi and rwanda before 
going across the continent to ivory coast where he will end his 
trip sept 10 by consecrating the immense basilica of our lady of 
peace 
rivaling st peters basilica in the vatican in size the 
structure was built by president felix houphouetboigny in his 
hometown of yamoussoukro the government said it cost 133 million 
critics say the real cost could be twice as high and bemoan the 
extravagance in a country undergoing its worst economic crisis in 
30 years of independence only about 11 percent of ivory coasts 11 
million residents are catholics with the majority practicing 
native tribal religions 
houphouetboigny has said he is paying for the basilica out of 
his own pocket published reports have alleged the sale of 16000 
stateowned apartments helped cover the cost 
pope john paul initially refused to bless the basilica which 
was completed last september after four years of work but in june 
the vatican said the pope had relented noting at the same time 
that houphouetboigny had agreed to build a hospital next to the 
basilica 
the basilica is modeled after st peters and is the only one in 
africa with a seating capacity of 7000 people and standing room 
for 11000 more it also is the continents biggest center for 
christian worship

amin a palestinian 
electrician who fled kuwait after working there for 21 years 
returned home this week with three small bags and little hope for 
the future 
it was the second time amin had fled a military occupation the 
first time was after the israeli conquest of the west bank and gaza 
strip in the 1967 middle east war 
this time its more difficult for us than in 1967 said amin 
on wednesday noting that he lost 65000 in savings and property 
in kuwait and had little chance of finding a job in his hometown of 
ramallah in the west bank 
amin who would only give his first name said he hoped to 
return to kuwait but was fearful political turmoil would keep him 
away he is one of thousands of palestinians set wandering by the 
gulf crisis and many have no home to go to 
amin is one of the lucky ones since he has the israelissued 
permit needed to live in the west bank and gaza palestinian 
leaders estimate that of the 320000 palestinians in kuwait only 
about 100000 have permits to live in the occupied lands many 
others are stuck in iraqioccupied kuwait 
seventy percent of the palestinians in kuwait have refugee 
documents they have no home to turn to no resident status in the 
west bank and gaza strip no place to go said saeb erakat a 
proplo west bank university lecturer and newspaper editor 
zuhaira kamal another prominent west bank palestinian added 
they have to stay in kuwait if there is war it will be a danger 
for everyone 
israeli military officials said they are issuing shortterm 
visitors visas to palestinians without residence permits but will 
not let them return permanently to live with relatives in the 
occupied territories 
they can come to these areas as visitors after three months 
they should leave if we reach the conclusion that it is a real 
humanitarian case we could extend the visit for another month or 
two said brig gen freddy zach deputy coordinator for policies 
in the west bank and gaza strip 
zach said the number of palestinians in kuwait with 
israeliissued residence permits was only 30000 
he spoke to reporters during an armyarranged tour of the 
allenby bridge a rickety wooden crossing over the jordan river 
that divides jordan and the west bank 
one of those making the trip from jordan on wednesday was 
69yearold rifka al kurd of jerusalem 
she had traveled to amman shortly after iraqs aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait to find out about her son nabil a 46yearold health 
ministry official in kuwait and daughter nabiha a 38yearold 
teacher 
mrs kurd said she was unable to make contact with her children 
and decided to return home 
i cannot sleep at night im very worried and very sad said 
mrs kurd as she waited for an israeli soldier to dump the contents 
of her suitcase on a table and check the items one by one 
both nabil and nabiha were born in arab east jerusalem but were 
outside the country during the 1967 middle east war and a 
subsequent israeli census of the occupied lands only those present 
for the census are entitled to residence permits 
mrs kurd said she has applied for permits for her children 
repeatedly but was always turned down 
like many other palestinians in kuwait nabil and nabiha have 
jordanian passports but the invasion left them stranded without 
money needed to start a new life in jordan and there are few jobs 
in the kingdom 
another palestinian caught without papers is bassel ishtayeh 
31 a math teacher in kuwait even though he was born in kuwait 
ishtayeh was denied citizenship and passports by the kuwaitis 
ishtayeh his wife and 1yearold son were visiting his wifes 
family in the west bank village of salfit near nablus when iraq 
invaded kuwait mrs ishtayeh and her son have west bank residence 
permits but her kuwaitiborn husband does not 
with his tourist visit expiring next week he could move to 
jordan on his jordanian passport but would have to leave behind his 
wife and child who as west bank residents do not have the right to 
live in jordan

investigators have been dispatched 
across the state to question possible suspects in the grisly 
slayings of five students that have paralyzed this college town 
police said thursday 
lt sadie darnell a gainesville police spokeswoman said some 
of the 600 law enforcement officials involved in a manhunt for the 
killer have been dispatched around the state to speak to suspects 
jailed for other crimes 
others were examining reports of other crimes including a gory 
slashing in ohio earlier this month 
but we dont see an imminent arrest lt spencer mann of the 
alachua county sheriffs department cautioned police do not have a 
hot suspect he said 
authorities were especially eager to find a man identified as 
warren virgil tinch of franklin ohio who is wanted for the 
stabbing death and mutilation of a 52yearold middletown ohio 
woman according to the gainesville sun 
witnesses allegedly spotted tinch 58 in gainesville and nearby 
ocala about a week before the five murders and the former auto 
dealership employee is alleged to have stolen cars from two lots by 
posing as a doctor or veterinarian the sun reported friday 
he is a possible suspect where he fits in on the hierarchy of 
suspects i dont know said darnell 
investigators were sent to bartow where the polk county 
sheriffs department was holding a man arrested for burglary who 
discussed the killings after turning himself in to police but 
spokeswoman lynn breidenbach said he could have learned the 
information from news reports 
in brevard county also in central florida police questioned an 
18yearold firstyear university of florida student arrested 
thursday on charges of battering his grandmother 
authorities meanwhile were struggling to contend with an 
active rumor mill in this city about the lust killer who 
according to the one report stole body parts of some victims 
university of florida president john lombardi said the school 
was operating normally and would not be held hostage to lunacy 
but flags on campus flew at halfstaff and the city was being 
combed by an army of local police state investigators and fbi 
agents 
were trying to put a security blanket over this city said 
police chief wayland clifton 
despite efforts by police and school officials to provide a safe 
and sane environment in the opening week of classes the discovery 
of the murdered students on sunday monday and tuesday released a 
virus of fear 
the fear was fed by published reports that the killer stole 
flesh from some of the mutilated victims and left the head of a 
decapitated victim sitting on a shelf 
police have given few details about the mutilations but the st 
petersburg times reported that pieces of flesh from the first three 
victims were missing the orlando sentinel reported that the 
nipples of the first two victims had been removed and had not been 
found 
clifton said it was the work of a lust killer 
fear affected at least one school assignment anne g jones an 
english professor said a class chose to put off reading paris 
trout a novel by pete dexter about a psychotic murderer stalking 
a small town 
they decided they didnt want to be reading this novel in the 
middle of the night she said 
the rumor mill generated endless false leads and terrifying new 
possibilities that hindered the investigation 
ive never seen it this bad its out of control said mann 
a 24hour rumorcontrol hot line at the alachua county crisis 
center had racked up more than 4000 calls since mondays initial 
fright 
theyre in full panic said a female counselor a uf 
graduate student who did not want her name used the kids are 
claiming that theyre not getting enough information from the 
authorities 
the most persistent rumors involved the discovery of more 
mutilated bodies but there also were reports of satanism stolen 
police uniforms and phony delivery men police categorically denied 
the stories 
wednesdays discovery of two bodies in melrose a small town 20 
miles to the northeast of gainesville set off a brief panic until 
police said the slayings were not related to the student killings 
many students left town early for the labor day weekend but 
lombardi asserted that things were returning to normal school 
officials said the frightened departure of some hundreds of 
students had little impact on the student body of 34000 
other state universities said they were getting inquiries about 
transfers 
students attended a memorial service thursday at the st 
augustine catholic center while individual services were planned 
in the dead students hometowns 
more than 1000 friends and family members attended a memorial 
service for one of the victims sonja larson 
was it just last week that we sat and talked about the 
future said the rev ken smith pastor of first baptist church 
in pompano beach where sonja and her family went to church for 
years 
sonjas boyfriend mic ocasio 18 of margate wept throughout 
the halfhour service as did hundreds of other friends from ely 
high school and the university of florida 
funeral services were scheduled friday for ms larsons roommate 
christina powell 17 in jacksonville for christa hoyt 18 in 
newberry and for tracy paules 23 in coral gables a service for 
23yearold manuel taboada the only male victim was set for 
friday in miami 
police have said the killer appears to be methodical and chooses 
his victims carefully focusing on petite brunettes with 
shoulderlength hair 
police have said three of the victims died from multiple stab 
wounds and that their bodies were mutilated autopsies have not 
been completed on the bodies of two students found tuesday 
sheriffs spokesman mann said

alex haley says he may not have become a writer 
if his parents and grandparents had not given him a footthick 
slice from a california redwood as a gift 60 years ago 
the tree slice had small white markers illustrating the trees 
growth haley says in the sept 2 issue of parade magazine 
i was told that if i read all i could whenever i found 
something notably historic then that could become another marker 
in my slice of tree he said 
from then on i read every book i could handle along with my 
grandpas newspapers for black people he said today i 
absolutely believe that the reading inspired by the tree slice 
greatly influenced my becoming an author it is also why i like

rachel ward believes being british and living in 
australia has limited her acting career in the united states but 
that better roles are coming her way 
not being american i really had to broaden my horizons 
ward says in the sept 2 issue of parade magazine its not just 
a matter of accents its the whole culture 
most of the female roles here are squeezed between the 
hardware and the special effects she said 
but in the past seven years ive done quite a selection of 
roles and now im getting a lot of scripts out of america more 
varied scripts so i guess its a matter of chipping away at the

sugar pills are more likely to live than those who dont follow 
the doctors orders according to a study in a british medical 
journal 
dr ralph horwitz of the yale university school of medicine 
author of the lancet study published thursday said researchers 
cannot explain why people who take their medicine even placebos 
are more likely to live 
we need a better measure of the social and psychological 
features to explain why it is he said 
horwitz said his team of researchers analyzed a 1978 test on 
beta blockers often given after a heart attack to reduce the 
likelihood of further damage 
half of the studys participants were given the drug and the 
other half were given placebos 
horwitzs analysis of the study found that those who took their

in american eyes the united nations has come 
a long way since those days a generation ago when signs sprouted 
along the nations highways carrying a succinct message the us 
out of the un and the un out of the us 
that was a time when the un was a target of widespread 
ridicule seemingly incapable of doing much to keep the peace the 
image of the grimfaced soviet envoy casting veto after veto was a 
topic of many a political cartoon 
but the ability of washington and moscow to get along has 
breathed new life into the longbeleaguered world body which is 
coming off one of the best months of its 45year history 
without much fanfare the security council this week laid the 
groundwork for an end to the 11yearold civil war in cambodia 
such agreement had been impossible beforehand because three of the 
five security council members the united states the soviet union 
and china had been backing different factions in that conflict 
even more impressive have been the councils labors on the 
persian gulf crisis 
the lengthening bread lines in baghdad these days are partly the 
result of the mandatory worldwide economic embargo the security 
council approved for iraq 
when it comes to regional conflicts unanimity has been as rare 
in the council as an august snow in the saudi arabian desert but 
since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait the council has virtually 
been working in lockstep approving even the use of military power 
to enforce its economic embargo 
it helps of course for the un to have the luxury of 
confronting a situation in which there is almost no ambiguity 
normally when one country interferes in the internal affairs of 
another it does so quietly through support for subversive groups 
or other covert means 
but iraqs saddam hussein is not a man given to subtlety he had 
a gripe with kuwait and after overrunning the place with 100000 
troops he annexed it if he was counting on a limp un response 
he guessed wrong 
if he had tried to work his will on kuwait a few years ago when 
the cold war was still simmering the united nations might have 
responded with its customary indecisiveness but with moscow and 
washington getting along better it is much easier for the un to 
stand up to saddam 
many of the cold war obstacles have dissipated and permitted 
the council to function as it was supposed to says john bolton 
who heads the state department office responsible for united 
nations affairs 
one measure of the changed attitude of the soviet union is that 
since the accession of president mikhail gorbachev the kremlin has 
not cast a single veto in the security council 
before that the soviets had vetoed 114 resolutions since the 
uns founding in 1945 the united states used its veto power 69 
times during that period 
americans came to see the un as a rat hole through which 
billions were squandered each year much of it compliments of the 
american taxpayer the un couldnt seem to take a stand against 
terrorism when the soviets invaded afghanistan the general 
assembly couldnt bring itself to denounce the soviets by name the 
assembly was considered little more than a forum for third world 
demagoguery 
while bloody police states escaped censure israel was treated 
as a pariah state in the view of many americans the un reached 
a low point 15 years ago when the assembly equated zionism with 
racism 
it was just three years ago that columnist charles krauthammer 
wrote the un is more than just a failed instrument it is a 
bad instrument we have the power to see it shelved we should use 
that power 
not many would agree with that sentiment nowadays except 
perhaps saddam hussein

labor day weekend travelers will be taking the summers last 
fling on the most expensive fuel in years and travel experts say a 
few may just decide to stay home 
the estimated 255 million who do travel could find other 
obstacles a nationwide traffic reporting service issued a list of 
highways that motorists might want to avoid and several states 
planned to use random checkpoints to nab drunken drivers 
the american automobile association expects a 2 percent decline 
in air train bus and car travel from last year partly due to 
rising gasoline prices following saddam husseins invasion of 
kuwait and partly due to an economic downturn that predates the 
middle east crisis 
aaa based in heathrow fla says americans are expected to 
travel 100 million miles by all modes of transportation during the 
threeday weekend during which more people are traditionally 
killed on highways than any other holiday period 
safety groups are hoping that energy and cost concerns will slow 
down drivers and decrease traffic enough to bring a death toll 
lower than last years 560 which was a decline from the previous 
threeyear average of 600 
aaas survey of gas prices thursday showed a plentiful supply of 
gas with unleaded regular averaging 130 a gallon 
the lundberg survey which says it checks more stations than 
aaa put the average for regular unleaded at 121 a gallon and the 
average for all grades of automotive fuel at 130 in its latest 
survey aug 24 
trilby lundberg of los angeles whose family business has been 
charting gas prices since the 1950s said the increases so far are 
remarkably similar to those that occurred after the exxon valdez 
oil spill last year 
and yet total us consumption slightly exceeded that of 
1988 she said its clear that the amount of increase is not 
necessarily enough to greatly alter our consumption patterns 
neither aaa nor lundberg was projecting pump prices for the 
weekend but both indicate that motorists are paying from 2 to 4 
more to fill up an average cars tank 
that should not be enough to affect longplanned trips said aaa 
spokesman jerry cheske but he said some people who travel on 
impulse may have second thoughts 
air travel is not expected to be significantly affected by the 
increase in jet fuel prices because most travelers purchased 
tickets before the kuwait invasion said philip davidoff 
presidentelect of the american society of travel agents 
airlines have announced some fare increases but many rolled 
them back to keep planes filled and bargain fares have been 
available on advance fares up to early december 
we might see a greater impact on christmas travel said 
davidoff who runs a travel agency in bowie md 
the trump and pan am shuttles that fly between some eastern 
cities have discount fares available for the weekend because they 
wont be carrying the usual business passengers 
but by far the most travel would be by private car with 235 
people traveling on highways 100 miles or more from home said aaa 
the figure was based on past data and a telephone survey of 1500 
americans an additional 2 million will ride buses trains or 
planes aaa said 
for motorists higher gas prices wont be the only obstacle 
metro traffic control a national traffic reporting service 
based in houston texas listed 48 areas in 23 states were highway 
construction or heavy congestion were expected to tie up holiday 
traffic it was the first time the service had issued a list of 
road problems 
among the worst according to spokesman jim oneill were the 
detour around earthquakedamaged interstate 880 in oakland calif 
i10 between lafayette and baton rouge la us 50 leading to 
maryland beaches stretches of interstate 75 in north monroe 
county mich i80 at parsippany nj and in clearfield and 
jefferson counties pa i5 from vancouver wash into portland 
ore and all routes into virginia beach va which police planned 
to close off due to violence sparked by college fraternity revelry 
last year 
drunken drivers also are getting special attention 
police in 27 states were setting up sobriety checkpoints under a 
supreme court ruling that allows police to make random checks for 
drunken drivers according to the american alliance for rights and 
responsibilities which surveyed state public safety officials 
most other states planned to step up enforcement for the weekend 
the group said 
president bush also declared it national drive for life weekend 
to push efforts against drunken driving which figures in about 
half of all traffic fatalities

residents of the nations capital finally are 
focusing attention on who will be their citys next leader after 
spending months preoccupied with the drug and perjury trial of 
outgoing mayor marion barry 
while barrys trial dominated the news the mayors wouldbe 
successors did little or no campaigning saving their efforts for a 
time when they would have the voters full attention 
five democrats and one republican are running for mayor with 
the winner of the sept 11 democratic primary considered the 
prohibitive favorite in a city where democrats outnumber 
republicans by almost a 91 margin 
until last week the press wasnt paying any attention to this 
campaign said city council chairman david clarke who is one of 
the democratic contenders finally we can get the issues out 
before the voters 
the campaign was forced offstage until aug 10 when barry was 
convicted of one misdemeanor cocaine possession charge and 
acquitted of another us attorney jay b stephens has not said 
whether he will retry barry on 12 other perjury conspiracy and 
cocaine possession charges on which the jury reached no decision 
there was some distraction because of the trial no 
question said candidate sharon prattdixon now they are 
paying attention to the candidates and the issues i feel like im 
getting my point across now 
barry announced as his trial began in june that he would not 
seek a fourth fouryear term as mayor saying now is the time for 
healing for me personally and for you politically he maintained 
he was unfairly singled out for prosecution partly because he is 
black 
barry filed petitions this week to run as an independent 
candidate for an atlarge seat on the city council where he served 
for four years before being elected mayor in 1978 barry faces a 
maximum penalty of one year in prison and a 100000 fine on the 
misdemeanor cocaine possession conviction 
the mayor whose trial featured videotaped evidence that showed 
him smoking crack cocaine during an fbi sting operation made 
frequent appearances at school antidrug rallies as part of his 
mayoral schedule 
some of the next mayors biggest challenges will be problems 
linked to the districts flourishing drug trade more than 400 
people were murdered in 1989 and another 200 in the first half of 
1990 more than half of the deaths blamed on drugs 
the citys infant mortality rate was more than double the 
national average in 1988 a problem city officials attributed in 
part to drug abuse among women of childbearing age 
the candidates also are calling for repairs to the citys 
deteriorating public housing units shrinking the districts 
bureaucracy and improving its muchmaligned public school system 
as the primary campaign entered the final stretch council 
member john ray was increasing the advantage he had over his 
opponents when the mayors case went to court in june 
rays rivals criticize him for his close ties to developers his 
efforts to do away with rent control and for omitting mention of 
his first wife a white woman from his official biography 
ray who is black had the support of 33 percent of registered 
democrats surveyed for a washington post poll released this week 
council member charlene drewjarvis was second at 17 percent 
followed by dixon and walter fauntroy the districts nonvoting 
delegate to congress with 10 percent and clarke with 9 percent 
the survey had a 3 percentage point margin of error 
two in 10 voters interviewed were undecided 48 percent of those 
who expressed a preference said they were not solidly behind that 
candidate and 48 percent said it was fairly important that barrys 
successor be black 
seventy percent of the districts residents are black clarke is 
the only white candidate in the mayoral race 
the only republican in the race is former dc police chief 
maurice t turner who announced he was leaving the democratic 
party in a highly publicized meeting with president bush last year

when rats are stuffed with the maximum 
nonlethal dose of a chemical and then develop cancer it may be 
the dose and not the chemical that causes the disease researchers 
say in reports published today 
bruce n ames professor of cell biology at the university of 
california berkeley said governmentsupported cancer tests on 
rats are useless because they depend upon the concept that high 
doses fed to rats over the short rodent lifetime produce the same 
results as very low exposures over a long period of time in humans 
ames said cancer may develop in test rats through a process of 
chronic wounding caused by the dose and not as a direct effect 
of the chemical 
animal cancer tests said ames are conducted at the maximum 
tolerated doses which kill cells and cause nearby cells to divide 
to replace the loss 
each time replacement cells are grown said ames there is a 
risk of a cancer mutation the more cells that are replaced over a 
lifetime the higher the odds of a cell mutating into cancer thus 
he said the cancer may be caused by the dose not by the chemical 
action itself 
government dependence on animal testing for carcinogens is 
pretty much useless for protecting us against low levels of 
chemicals ames said in an interview when you test chemicals 
on rats at very high doses the maximum tolerated doses half of 
them will come out positive develop cancer but the reason is 
that it is killing cells 
such tests he said are chronic wounding experiments and 
chronic wounding is a risk factor for cancer 
ames said that people are unreasonably afraid of synthetic 
chemicals but that humans eat many natural cancercausing 
chemicals in their everyday diet 
he said 77 chemicals that occur naturally in foods have been 
tested on rats at maximum tolerated doses and 37 have been found to 
be carcinogens ames said about the same proportion of carcinogens 
have been found in synthetic chemicals tested 212 out of 350 
a simple cup of coffee said ames has 826 volatile chemicals 
scientists have tested 21 of these chemicals using high doses and 
found that 16 are rodent carcinogens he said 
you get more carcinogens in a cup of coffee than in all of the 
synthetic pesticide residues you absorb in a year said ames 
the scientists said there is a public fear about minute 
quantities in the diet of manmade pesticide residues but he 
noted 999 percent of all pesticides we eat are natural he 
said and 27 out of 52 tested pesticides that occur naturally in 
plants have been found to be rodent carcinogens 
in another paper in science samuel m cohen of the university 
of nebraska college of medicine said that in studies on mice he and 
his collaborators demonstrated that there can be both a dose and a 
chemical effect in developing cancer 
for some chemicals said cohen cancer developed in laboratory 
animals only at very high levels while other chemicals at very low 
doses can trigger mutations that can lead to cancer 
cohen said however that federal law requires all chemicals 
that cause cancer in test animals no matter what the dose to be 
regulated 
a large proportion of the compounds perhaps 50 percent 
listed in the national toxicology program which evaluates 
chemicals cause cancer only at high doses he said 
cohen said the government now classifies chemicals as 
cancercausing or noncancercausing he said there needs to be a 
third category for those compounds that cause cancer only at very 
high doses 
ames said many people demand regulation of synthetic chemicals 
that may be in the environment at only one part per billion this 
he said is not realistic 
one part per billion is one person in all of china he said 
its one drop of vermouth in five tank cars of gin 
people should stop spending all the time and money on such 
trivial levels and start getting after the important cancer 
risks such as smoking preventable infections and high fat 
diets said ames 
sydney green director of toxicological studies for the food and 
drug administration said the views expressed by ames and cohen 
about the value of animal cancer tests are not universally 
accepted but he admitted that some government scientists are 
starting to question past scientific assumptions on cancer tests 
cancers may be caused by dose alone in some cases said green 
but thats uncertain at this point and you cannot extrapolate 
some findings to all substances 
dr bernard d goldstein chairman of the department of 
environmental medicine at the university of medicine and dentistry 
of new jersey said he is convening a panel at the national academy 
of science to examine the use of animal tests in determining human 
cancer risk 
the issues are open to scientific debate he said there 
is a fair amount of interest developing in the issue of maximum 
tolerate dose in evaluating the risk of cancer 
science which published papers by ames and cohen is the 
journal of the american association for the advancement of science

in this kingdoms oldest inhabited 
oasis the middle east crisis that brought the american armed 
forces to saudi arabia seems far away and the future is placed in 
gods hands 
khalid allataibi shook his head after the weekly camel auction 
at the oasis 100 miles south of the oil capital of dhahran 
the market was tired he said few of the meat camels for 
sale reached the top price of 400 
he did not attribute the low prices to iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait and the subsequent war tension on his countrys northern 
border 
its the heat said the 27yearold electrician with the 
aramco oil giant who tends camels in his native village on 
weekends august temperatures soar to 120 degrees 
but war was on everybodys mind allataibi conceded 
its all the people talk about first lets talk about peace 
then if theres no peace we can talk about war he said 
as he spoke young camels yowled in the background 
but the sellers seemed more intent on discussing the merits of a 
13000 racing camel than the conflict 
the government has recently encouraged the breeding of racing 
camels by supporting prizes of up to 26000 and fourwheel drive 
vehicles the racing season starts in october 
a 10yearold boy said he now had four camels his father had 
given him one to start trading with he said his ambition was to 
make money and be a pilot 
the skies over houfuf were free of the huge c5 galaxy 
transports and f15 jet fighters that roared over dhahran capital 
of saudi arabias oilrich eastern province and operations center 
for the airlift of us men and equipment 
the mud brick past of the town is longburied its main street 
is a strip of carpet stores auto dealers and fast food 
restaurants favorite cars include general motors suburbans and 
chevrolet silverados 
people downtown said there was a run on food in the first days 
after iraqi president saddam husseins troops overran kuwait and 
massed along the emirates border with saudi arabia 
they were afraid but now with the american army any rocket or 
any plane saddam sent could be destroyed said an 18yearold 
who gave only his first name ibrahim 
people still plan for escaping any fighting but the mood is 
calmer now said shopkeeper abdullah 22 
i have my passport i have my money but im here were safer 
here he said 
escape plans include flight across hundreds of miles of desert 
to mecca and medina the holiest cities in islam 
but in the palm groves of the surrounding villages the people 
are not worried about war 
if theres fighting it would be in khafji and thats far 
away said haji fahd mubarak selling watermelons at one roadside 
stand khafji lies 240 miles to the north on the border with 
kuwait 
the fruit sellers like the camel farmers said the sitaution 
was out of their control 
im not worried said camel farmer bakhit salah 36 i 
leave it in gods hands

fraternity brothers and other male 
students in this college town say theyve assumed a special 
responsibility following five killings but sometimes bravado masks 
fear 
a lot of the guys are feeling the john wayne macho man kind of 
thing said todd silberman 20 a junior at the university of 
florida who volunteered for the student nighttime auxiliary patrol 
to escort women students at night 
my fraternity we volunteered to help out with snap but 
you know were scared ourselves he said some of our guys are 
going home 
when the bodies of the first three victims all women were 
found early this week many men at the university say they quickly 
phoned female friends to offer escorts or other aid 
two fraternities offered their entire memberships as volunteers 
to snap 
males suddenly were a pillar of strength said tom santilli 
president of the universitys interfraternity council 
after two more bodies were found one of them male fear spread 
among men santilli said thursday but he added i still think 
theres a sense that males protect 
in the midnight darkness wednesday freshman peter dodzik kept 
as much as possible in the light spilling from a parking garage as 
he returned from escorting a friend back to her dormitory 
even before the panic really started said the 18yearold 
from fort wayne ind i called all the girls i know to make 
sure they were ok 
joe cannistra 21 a senior said ive been on the phone many 
nights talking to my women friends making sure theyre ok id say 
theres an extra responsibility to the women 
at the snap office calls for escorts have increased from the 
usual 40 or so a night to as many as 200 there are about 23 
escorts screened by campus police said brett hodgson a snap 
supervisor and a senior 
what about fear i dont think any of our guys are really that 
concerned hodgson said crediting that mainly to training that 
teaches them how to get a sense of trouble before it would 
happen 
stacy tuerpe who works in the snap office said men on campus 
were making an effort 
i know lots of guys that are staying with girls they dont 
know that well she said they just live next door the girls 
just didnt want to stay alone 
at a gainesville rally wednesday evening to protest violence 
against women one speaker sallie ann harrison criticized the 
creators of horror films they know what theyre doing theyre 
reinforcing male rage she said 
authorities on serial killers have said the gainesville killer 
is almost certainly a man probably a loner in his 20s or 30s 
santilli said some of the male students actions may be attempts 
to negate the view that the killer was doing a male thing 
i dont think theres that many people like that he said 
he was just a sick person

the persian gulf crisis has placed major 
strains on yemens new unity underscoring the deep ideological 
divide between its oncerival states and jeopardizing relations 
with neighboring saudi arabia 
iraq which has close ties to yemen invaded kuwait only three 
months after the may 22 merger of conservative north yemen and 
marxist south yemen the merger ended nearly three decades of 
rivalry on the southwestern tip of the arabian peninsula 
the new nation of 12 million sits astride the bab el mandeb 
strait the southern gateway to the red sea the sea became more 
important after the 198088 iraniraq spilled into the persian gulf 
western diplomats say the new persian gulf crisis has brought 
out smoldering ideological differences inside yemen there had been 
opposition to the merger from islamic militants in the north and 
diehard marxists in the south 
thousands of yemenis have mounted demonstrations to support 
iraqi president saddam hussein many have reportedly volunteered to 
fight for iraq against the united states and its allies who are 
building up forces in saudi arabia 
gen ali abdullah saleh president of the new yemen republic 
has been put on the spot he is trying to support iraq while 
avoiding a collision with saudi arabia analysts say 
a yemeni newspaper editor speaking on condition of anonymity 
said were in a difficult situation because of our close 
ties with iraq 
saleh the former president of north yemen is one of saddams 
main allies he has refused to join arab moderates in their stand 
against iraq he has also objected to the thousands of us and 
other troops deployed in saudi arabia to counter iraq 
however yemen has also said it will abide by economic sanctions 
imposed by the united nations on iraq 
british sources said yemen could become a staging post for an 
air bridge into iraq to get around the quarantine but aviation 
experts think it unlikely 
some arab diplomats find salehs stance inexplicable and even 
selfdestructive they contend no yemeni leader can afford to 
offend the saudis one of the countrys main benefactors 
but like king hussein of jordan another saddam ally saleh 
faces serious damage to his shaky economy if trade ties with iraq 
are severed 
if iraq comes out victorious in this crisis yemen will look 
good if iraq loses yemen will be in a difficult position in all 
respects politically militarily and economically said one 
arab diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the invasion of kuwait was an economic blow in itself to yemen 
kuwait like saudi arabia provided financial aid and crude oil to 
yemens oil refinery at aden iraq has an agreement to provide 
30000 barrels a day 
oil industry sources indicating that yemen is abiding by the 
embargo reported that oil is now being pumped from the north to 
aden to make up for the loss of iraqi and kuwaiti supplies 
british royal air force sources have reported that some iraqi 
combat jets have been flown to yemen for use if iraqi air bases are 
hit saleh has denied that 
yemen emerged as a potential flashpoint when us warships began 
shadowing iraqi oil tankers to aden enforcing the unsanctioned 
trade embargo against iraq 
yemens information minister mohammed ahmed garhoum denied 
british allegations that yemen violated the un sanctions by 
allowing an iraqi tanker the ain zalah to unload at aden 
he said in a telephone interview that the tanker partially 
unloaded before the sanctions but unloading stopped after the 
embargo resolution 
yemen last week ordered the expulsion of britains 
consulgeneral in aden douglas gordon after he was arrested 
photographing shipping at aden but the yemenis relented after 
strong british protests 
garhoum insisted its not true that yemen supports iraq 
yemen wants iraq to withdraw its forces from kuwait 
our position is clear our government underlines the necessity 
of respect for national sovereignty and we reject the use of 
force its only a summer cloud that will soon go away he said

if congress and the white house dont solve 
the governments budget problems soil and water conservation 
programs will suffer along with other agriculture department 
services 
an analysis by the departments budget office says a 
sequester plan to cut federal spending would result in unpaid 
furloughs for thousands of soil conservation service employees 
overall about 90 percent of the departments 100000 fulltime 
employees would be affected one way or another by the layoffs and 
other savings measures 
the white house citing the grammrudman deficitreduction law 
has ordered the acrosstheboard cut of federal spending to begin 
in october if no budget agreement is reached 
by law the soil conservation service is responsible for 
defining highly erodible land and wetlands and for helping farmers 
develop and install conservation plans in order to continue 
qualifying for usda program benefits 
the agency said planning of the necessary projects has been 
completed but that only about 30 percent of the necessary measures 
have been installed 
under the law farmers have until dec 31 1994 to install 
approved conservation systems swampbuster provisions require the 
soil conservation service to have wetland determinations completed 
by dec 31 1991 and an inventory of wetlands ready by the end of 
1992 
besides these mandated timetables the conservation service also 
must provide technical assistance for the vast conservation reserve 
program which now has about 34 million acres under 10year 
contracts 
the program provides financial assistance to convert highly 
erodible cropland into protective grass or trees it also provides 
annual rental payments over the 10year contract averaging almost 
50 per year per acre 
a sequester of 319 percent in the usda spending for the fiscal 
year that will begin oct 1 would cut about 73 billion from 
programs that otherwise would cost 229 billion in 199091 
food stamps school lunches and other entitlement programs 
costing around 23 billion next year would mostly be exempt from 
the cuts 
under a 319 percent sequester used in the analysis and 
officials say it could go higher the conservation money still 
available for 199091 would be used mainly to help meet the 
deadlines ordered by law 
that would be done at the expense of other conservation 
operations such as the water quality initiative soil mapping and 
other operations the usda report said 
continued assistance to the nearly 3000 conservation 
districts would also be jeopardized and it would be necessary to 
reduce services at most scs field offices it said even with 
the best efforts to meet the higher priority needs it is unlikely 
that many of the conservation targets could be met 
the conservation reserve program last year was determined to be 
subject to a federal cutback and if this is upheld for 199091 it 
could mean reductions in the payments farmers get for program land 
under contract the report said 
reneging on such monetary incentives would be harmful to the 
cause of conservation and environmental improvement said kenneth 
cook of the washingtonbased center for resource economics 
conservation along with research seem to be always the first 
things to go while the entitlements are protected above all 
else cook said thursday in a telephone interview 
at the start of this year he said everyone including the 
administration and congress was saying that incentives were needed 
to deal with water quality and pollution problems

the agriculture department has notified the 
nations 6300 meat and poultry plants that budget cuts will force 
the withdrawal of federal inspection services this fall 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said thursday layoffs of inspection 
personnel will effectively close the plants during those periods 
the layoffs or furloughs would begin oct 1 under an initial 
sequester order by president bush he said a final determination 
would be made by oct 15 if congress and the white house fail to 
reach a budget agreement 
crawford said the initial furloughs would be for a maximum of 36 
hours during the oct 114 period

westerners caught in kuwait survive day 
by day in a harrowing hideandseek game with iraqis intent on 
finding yet more hostages for their human shield say some escapees 
at this border post 
spirits are good but people are trapped in their homes 
hiding out and hoping for the best said ayman aziz a greek 
engineer who also has an arab nationality he would not specify 
he slipped out of kuwait on tuesday but waved off questions on 
how he did it lets just say there is more than one way to 
falsify papers he said thursday at ruweishid 210 miles 
northeast of amman 
each day troops tighten the circle he said with roadblocks 
every few streets they are starting to seal off neighborhoods 
and search housetohouse in the city he said 
about 21000 westerners including 3000 americans were in 
kuwait when iraq invaded on aug 2 an unknown number escaped 
mostly into saudi arabia but some others were taken to baghdad 
iraqi agents rounded up 32 more britons the foreign office said 
thursday in london bringing to 197 the total of british subjects 
detained in kuwait also authorities seized the passports of six 
italians at a hotel 
many western families live in the suburbs where they elude 
capture by staying behind drawn curtains living in the dark at 
night and husbanding their dwindling reserves of food 
they cant go outside they cant communicate with their 
embassies said aziz the engineer all they can do is listen 
to bbc every hour they are waiting for the marines to rescue them 
but they are afraid of what might happen if the marines try 
in kuwait city itself the game is grimmer iraqis are beginning 
to examine bank records to find foreigners home addresses other 
refugees said 
i stayed in hiding like a rat eating nothing but rice and 
lentils said jm sharma a 55yearold american agricultural 
scientist of indian origin he flew to amman from baghdad on 
thursday using an indian travel document 
sharma said he moved to an asian working class neighborbood to 
escape detection he and some friends hid food in air ducts to be 
sure of a future supply 
he said he was saddened he could not have take an american 
colleague with him 
a white american is different from a brown american he 
said i could pass this man was as white as they come if i 
had some way of making his skin dark i would have brought him 
otherwise they would have spotted him right away 
only a few westerners in kuwait have heeded iraqi instructions 
to report to hotels some are in hotels under strict controls 
aziz was one of the few westerners among the 250000 refugees 
who have streamed through ruweishid 
egyptians bangladeshis and other asians are being processed at 
a steady rate of about 20000 a day about 25000 more sprawl 
listlessly in makeshift tent cities awaiting their turn 
the scene ranges from abject misery to good humor 
on thursday children jumped up and down with excitement 
laughing and pointing when jordanian fighters streaked overhead on 
a surveillance mission 
among the sea of abjectly poor refugees three little girls 
looked in dazed confusion from the rear window of a cinnamon rolls 
royce it was in mint condition except a smashed rr hood 
ornament 
nearly everyone has left behind all family holdings in kuwait 
workers fled without their meager savings or their last paychecks 
other refugees abandoned property worth millions 
but the western refugees said people left behind would be happy 
to trade their fortunes for freedom 
the biggest worry is that they might cut off the water and 
electricity sharma the agricultural scientist said in amman 
if the multinational force poised in saudi arabia attacks kuwait to 
oust iraq he said utilities would go first 
thats the first thing he saddam hussein will do sharma 
he has put dynamite around the plants and hell dynamite the 
whole shebang 
but aziz said power and water supplies were normal and people 
could use their air conditioning most families still had food 
stocked in freezers he said 
but theyre out of booze he added if you have a beer 
id be grateful

the thousands of americans held in iraq 
constitute the largest group of us hostages since plane 
hijackings and kidnappings became widespread instruments of 
political persuasion in the middle east 
however theyre in a new kind of bind unlike the blindfolded 
hostages held in closets or at gunpoint in lebanon and iran in 
recent years the americans in iraq have generally received 
acceptable physical treatment according to reports reaching the 
west 
in addition they are being held by the iraqi government not 
factions with links to a national leadership and used to deter 
any air attack on the country 
beyond that little is known of the americans trapped in iraq 
and occupied kuwait in the first days after the aug 2 invasion 
it was estimated there were 3000 americans in kuwait and 500 in 
iraq among the 21000 westerners in the two countries 
but these figures are obsolete because many have fled most of 
them americans of arab or asian extraction officials in washington 
say about a third of the americans in kuwait before the invasion 
were arab americans or asian americans 
a white american is different from a brown american said 
jm sharma an american agricultural engineer of indian origin who 
flew to jordan on thursday 
after the united states and other nations began sending forces 
to the region to counter iraq iraqi president saddam hussein 
announced that foreigners from aggressive nations would not be 
allowed to leave the country he said they must remain as 
guests placed at strategic locations to protect against a 
possible attack on iraq 
many americans were rounded up and taken to baghdad officials 
said at least five dozen were known to have been used as human 
shields 
polish workers returning home from iraq told a newspaper last 
week they saw about 35 americans arriving under guard at the 
chemadex chemical factory in alqaim where they worked 
other americans have remained behind staying inside to avoid 
detention fearful of trying to contact their embassies and living 
off dwindling food supplies according to refugees reaching jordan 
some of the americans work for large us firms under contract 
to kuwaiti enterprises such as oil companies some work as 
teachers or in small businesses 
other americans like elizabeth linoff were traveling when iraq 
invaded kuwait 
ms linoff 50 was among 237 western women and children 
gathered thursday at a hotel in baghdad awaiting exit visas saddam 
announced earlier this week he would release foreign women and 
children 
ms linoff said she was working as an english teacher in 
casablanca morocco and was en route from france to kuala lumpur 
at the time of the invasion when her british airways flight was 
stranded 
im happy that its now all over she told a reporter 
but it was unclear if it was all over 
saddams announcement tuesday said the women and children would 
be allowed to leave starting wednesday western governments 
complained thursday that an undue amount of paperwork was required 
for the exit visas 
margaret tutwiler a state department spokesman said there are 
about 500 american women in kuwait as well as 410 children under 
age 18 she indicated the number of women and children in iraq is 
less than 100 
the baghdad government said 28 foreign guests had opted to 
stay diplomats in the iraqi capital said they were mostly those 
with government contracts or businesses in iraq

when the men of the 265th quartermaster 
detachment crossed the boundaries of this huge military base their 
teeth became the property and responsibility of the us army 
the tiny national guard water purification unit of 14 men has 
been activated for possible duty in saudi arabia the south 
carolina guardsmen face the potential of blazing desert heat and 
the uncertainties of geopolitics 
but first came the picks and pliers of a dentist known lovingly 
on base as the prince of pain 
six men had teeth pulled or cavities filled at the end of their 
first day of mobilization most were muttering and lisping through 
novocain and cotton gauze 
i guess yall have some pretty bad teeth said the units 
leader a sergeant named ronnie who is a probation officer in 
civilian life army security rules prohibit publication of the 
mens last names 
huh uhh ahh ernie another sergeant said opening his 
mouth to display the fact the bad teeth were no more 
thursdays tooth torture was an ignoble beginning for the 265th 
which received an emotional sendoff wednesday from allendale sc 
all the men are from allendale or the outlying communities of 
brunson and fairfax small towns about three hours drive from fort 
stewart 
despite the oppressive heat more than 1000 people nearly 20 
percent of allendales population turned out for a red white and 
blue bannered celebration of speeches and church choir songs each 
man of the unit was presented with a bible 
the celebration spilled into the next morning students from the 
local elementary and high schools lined the road to wave as the 
unit left for fort stewart with its three 15ton trucks fitted 
with equipment that uses filters and chemicals to purify water 
the callup of the 265th is a source of local pride south 
carolina has guard units that drive m1 tanks and fly apache 
helicopters but only the 265th has been activated an indication 
of the value clean drinking water will have for us troops in the 
mideast 
we know we can get the mission done said william a 
44yearold construction worker who served a tour of duty in 
vietnam 20 years ago there is another vietnam vet in the unit 
nearly half have seen duty in the regular military 
the men of the 265th represent a cross section of the 
civiliansoldiers being called to duty in the gulf crisis they 
range from henry a 51yearold retired football coach to james a 
20yearold marketing major at the university of south carolina 
some have served in the unit for 18 years 
when i got out of the army i wanted to stay part of the 
military so i joined the guard william said 
until now that meant giving up a weekend every month two weeks 
each summer and occasional special duty like last years hurricane 
hugo 
but on sunday they lost their weekend warrior status when they 
were placed on alert for at least the next 90 days the guardsmen 
will be regular soldiers assigned to the us 2nd army 
other guard and reserve units from georgia and florida have been 
sent to fort stewart normally a bustling base of 14000 where 
empty parade grounds and parking lots testify to the deployment of 
regular forces to the persian gulf 
but the reservists are mostly housekeeping units of clerks 
and typists needed to keep the giant base going only the 265th has 
been set for overseas service 
that prospect was the subject of jokes among the men as they 
bounced in the back of a truck on its way from the mess hall back 
to the stifling hot barracks they will live in until they go home 
or overseas 
one man wondered aloud how fast and deep you could dig a foxhole 
in the sand the black soldiers kidded about the prospect of 
suntans they speculated about how long it would be before they 
will be deployed a week said one three weeks said 
another 
ninety days sounds good to me said a third 
william the vietnam veteran said no one was too concerned 
about the future 
i dont worry he said i learned that if you follow the 
rules and regulations and pay attention to your training itll be 
all right

political action committees are donating 
record amounts to congressional candidates favoring democrats over 
republicans and by a wide margin incumbents over challengers 
new federal election commission figures showed thursday that 
candidates running for congress in the 198990 election cycle 
collected a record 937 million from pacs from jan 1 1989 
through last june 30 
the total compares to 88 million in the first 18 months of the 
198788 election cycle and is a dramatic increase from the 71 
million given to congressional candidates in the 198586 cycle 
democrats who control congress easily outdistanced 
republicans receiving more than 59 million from pacs compared to 
more than 34 million for gop candidates 
most pac contributions 79 million went to incumbents while 
65 million went to challengers and 81 million to those running 
for open seats 
fred wertheimer president of the congressional watchdog group 
common cause said the extraordinary ratio of incumbents to 
challengers just reaffirms that pacs are an incumbent reelection 
machine today and a central part of what is wrong with the current 
campaign finance system 
they are playing a major role in making it exceedingly 
difficult for challengers to have a chance to run competitive 
races and they are obviously continuing to use their money to try 
to influence congressional decisions 
each house of congress passed legislation to curb spending for 
congressional campaigns however the versions have major 
differences and it is unclear whether a compromise can be worked 
out this year 
wertheimer said he favors the twotiered approach in the senate 
bill ban pacs altogether but if that provision is ruled 
unconstitutional severely limit pac contributions 
the senate fall back provision would limit pac money to 20 
percent of a candidates campaign contributions and limit a single 
pacs contributions to 1000 per candidate for each election 
current law only limits individual pac contributions with 
5000 allowed per candidate for each election 
the house bill would impose an aggregate pac limit of 275000 
for each candidate the current 5000 contribution limits would be 
retained 
most pacs are formed by special interest groups labor 
organizations and corporations 
in the 18month fec figures corporate pacs led in al categories 
of donations contributing 35 million to federal candidates 
followed by the 26 million contributed by pacs in the combined 
category of trade associations membership organizations and health 
groups labor pacs were next with 20 million 
the study also showed that overall pac spending for federal 
candidates increased by 83 percent to 233 million in the first 
18 months of the current cycle total pac receipts rose 33 percent 
to 275 million 
more than 66 million of the pac contributions went to house 
candidates while 27 million went to candidates for the senate 
the fec said the most money collected by a pac was 8 million 
by the teamstersrun democratic republican independent voter 
education committee the american medical association political 
action committee was next collecting 47 million 
the teamsters organization also spent the most 64 million 
followed by the amas pac which spent 3 million 
american telephone amp telegraphs pac led corporate committees 
collecting more than 2 million followed by the federal express 
corp pac with just over 1 million the two pacs also led 
corporate disbursements

the nations top sampl regulator says it is 
becoming increasingly difficult to decide which troubled thrifts 
should be taken over by the government 
the job is going to get much tougher timothy ryan director 
of the office of thrift supervision told a news conference 
thursday 
the savings and loans seized by the government in the months 
following the enactment of legislation a year ago were blatantly 
clear cases of failure ryan said 
they were like pornography he said you know it when you 
see it 
now however many troubled sampls are in borderline financial 
situations and much more difficult to identify ryan added 
since the sampl bailout bill became law the governments 
resolution trust corp has taken over 475 ailing institutions 
the office of thrift supervision has recently taken a new 
approach seeking to sell crippled sampls to outside investors while 
they are still under private ownership rather than transferring 
them to the resolution trust corp once they are taken over by the 
government the institutions become more difficult to sell ryan 
noted 
he made the comments as he released an office of thrift 
supervision report showing that the financial conditions of more 
than 200 savings and loans have worsened since the agency made its 
last such report in may 
at least 246 sampls are expected to fail and are likely candidates 
for government takeover the office of thrift supervision said in 
its new report 
if current economic conditions continue or get worse its 
very possible we will see additional deterioration when we report 
again in three months ryan said 
he noted that the sharp increase in oil prices caused by the 
persian gulf crisis had heightened the economic uncertainty the 
thrift industry already suffering from a slowing economy and real 
estate market could be jolted further by rising oil prices 
anything thats bad news for the economy is bad news for the 
sampl cleanup said bert ely a financial institutions analyst in 
alexandria va 
the thrift agencys latest report provides additional evidence 
that we clearly have a deteriorating condition in these 
institutions ely said 
the government has estimated the cost of the savings and loan 
bailout at about 500 billion or 2000 for every us taxpayer 
over the next 30 years 
in its latest quarterly report the office of thrift supervision 
detailed the changes in its classification of the nations sampls 
into four categories of financial health 
there was a modest shifting of sampls from one category to 
another based on financial results for the period from jan 1 
through march 31 the agency said 
the categories are 
group i institutions considered by regulators to be profitable 
and with sufficient capital currently 1175 sampls 
group ii sampls that meet or are expected to meet capital 
requirements 680 
group iii troubled thrifts with poor earnings and low capital 
352 
group iv institutions expected to fail and be taken over by 
the resolution trust corp 246 
the report showed a net decline of 89 in the healthiest sampls 
those in group i 
nearly all the 106 institutions that left the category got 
worse but 17 institutions from lower ratings improved 
there was a net decline of 64 in the shakiest thrifts including 
51 that were seized by the resolution trust corp 
thirtyfour of the shaky sampls improved their position and moved 
into a healthier category mainly by getting new infusions of 
capital from outside investors the office of thrift supervision 
said 
group iv institutions continue to be concentrated in a few 
states texas had the greatest number with 29 followed by florida 
with 25 california 22 illinois 18 new jersey 17 and ohio and 
louisiana 11 each 
in addition thrift assets among the shakiest institutions 
continue to be concentrated in a relatively few large institutions 
with 73 percent of the assets held by 41 sampls with assets of at 
least 1 billion

the curtain drops on the summer movie season 
this weekend with the spectral romance of ghost winning the 
most moviegoers hearts surpassing such bigbudget thrillers as 
total recall and die hard 2 
tom cruises days of thunder faded early the muchhyped 
dick tracy failed to fire up the box office for long 
bruce willis die hard 2 did well but wasnt tops and 
robocop 2 quickly ran out of power 
not even the industrys most prescient prognosticators picked 
ghost to scare up the most business 
a modest supernatural thriller starring demi moore patrick 
swayze and whoopi goldberg ghost today should pass arnold 
schwarzeneggers total recall to reach the boxoffices top 
spot with more than 115 million at the gate paramount pictures 
says 
its so far away from whats out there this summer said 
ghosts maker producer howard w koch the audience said 
no more fourletter words i dont want to see anybody blown up 
its about time people can be in love with one another and not feel 
embarrassed 
said bruce corwin president of southern californias 
metropolitan movie theater chain this summer had an abundance of 
actionorieneted films and they just fought each otherghost 
was huge a pleasant surprise to everyone 
koch admitted the paramount film budgeted around 20 million 
was an unlikely hit the audience was attracted by positive word of 
mouth and a strong story by writer bruce joel rubin and director 
jerry zucker 
barry london president of paramounts motion picture group 
said the film was marketed for a select audience 
we attempted to take advantage of the perceived lack of 
programming for women london said we elected to focus on the 
romance of the film rather than the action or comedy he said 
too that the films stars tirelessly promoted their work 
koch hopes the films smashing showing will prove to hollywood 
deal makers that 12 million acting contracts the going rate for 
schwarzenegger dont necessarily guarantee success 
indeed in a season loaded with several overblown sequels and 
richly budgeted action films most performed only moderately well 
paramounts days of thunder for instance has made 79 
million just a few million more than cruises 1988 cocktail 
the studios another 48 hrs with eddie murphy and nick nolte

inadequate 
anytime you can do movies around 80 million or more by 
batman standards thats not considered successful but by 
industry standards thats very successful logsdon said 
warner bros whose batman clobbered the competition last 
summer with 2337 million in domestic receipts was not a factor 
this season competing faintheartedly with gremlins 2 the new 
batch and the late comer presumed innocent 
as is certain in a season as crowded as this summer there were 
a number of bombs they included jack nicholsons the two 
jakes the middle east drama navy seals bill cosby in 
ghost dad and betsys wedding 
according to the trade newspaper daily variety the walt disney

the 1990 summer daily variety said should be the second best

the labor department is launching a program to 
reduce repetitive motion disorders in the workplace starting with 
plants that process red meat where the rate is 10 times that of 
other industries 
these sometimes crippling disorders account for nearly half of 
all occupational disorders in the united states 
labor secretary elizabeth dole in announcing the initiative 
thursday said the department has drafted with the help of unions 
and meat industry representatives a set of guidelines to help 
companies deal with the problem 
its really a common sense approach that combines proper 
workplace engineering job design effective employee training and 
education she said 
the guidelines will be voluntary but companies that agree to 
follow them would avoid special inspections targeted at repetitive 
motion problems beginning in january 1991 she said 
we think its a positive agreement said j patrick boyle 
president of the american meat institute which represents 450 meat 
processing and packing companies that make up about 95 percent of 
the red meat industry 
repetitive motion trauma results from repeated motion or awkward 
positioning of the hand arm back or leg for extended periods 
disorders include lower back injuries tendon disorders and carpal 
tunnel syndrome a nerve disorder of the hand and wrist 
in the meat industry which employs about 140000 nationwide 
workers often perform repetitive motions such as cutting and 
lifting 
in 1988 an estimated 20000 to 25000 meatpackers and 
processers were among an estimated 140000 us workers reported to 
have repetitive motion disorders officials said experts believe 
that half or fewer of the disorders actually are reported 
the labor department is beginning the process of drafting rules 
to cover workers in all industries but she said that could take 
years to complete 
in the meantime she said the guidelines for the red meat 
industry are an effort to eliminate as many illnesses as possible 
as quickly as possible 
the guidelines will be sent to each red meat plant in the united 
states 
the 16 largest companies which each have more than 1000 
employees and later the approximately 20 companies that have more 
than 500 workers at a single plant will be asked to agree to adopt 
the guidelines said alan mcmillan deputy assistant labor 
secretary 
that would cover more than half of the workers in the beef and 
pork industries he said 
smaller businesses will be able to request training and other 
technical assistance from the occupational safety and health 
administration 
companies that agree to the guidelines will be monitored and 
osha will conduct inspections in response to complaints but the 
companies would not be cited for violations if monitoring showed 
they were making progress in eliminating repetitive motion hazards 
mrs dole said 
some recommended solutions to repetitive motion problems include 
proper design of work stations employee training slowing 
production rates limiting overtime and rotating workers among 
different jobs

tens of thousands of americans every year die 
from diseases they contracted in the workplace a private research 
organization reports 
occupational disease is the most neglected public health 
problem in the us today said the report by the chicagobased 
national safe workplace institute released thursday 
this kind of illness is essentially invisible to the public 
because occupational disease has a long latency period and mimics 
other illnesses most who suffer from it do not even know they 
contracted their disease in the workplace the report said 
the researchers blame much of the problem on the federal 
government through what it argued was under funding of enforcement 
agencies and inadequate standards 
the report estimated that occupational diseases including 
cancer and pulmonary neurological and cardiovascular diseases 
caused by hazards on the job killed between 47377 and 95479 
americans in 1987 the estimate was based on a study of data 
collected by the national center for health statistics a 
government agency 
the study did not consider onthejob injuries which in 1987 
killed about 11100 people and disabled 18 million according to 
the bureau of labor statistics 
the report said its estimate is consistent with others it noted 
that a 1985 study by the congressional office of technology 
assessment estimated that american workers get 390000 jobrelated 
illnesses every year and 100000 die 
even though it is not recognized as such occupational disease 
is clearly one of the most significant causes of premature death in 
the us today said the report 
dr stephen hessl of the university of illinois school of 
medicine and dr howard frumkin of emory university directed the 
study for the institute a nonprofit research and education 
organization financed by foundations and individual donations 
the institute said the federal governments response to the 
problem has been timid 
federal spending on workplace health and safety failed to keep 
pace with inflation during the reagan administration in the 1980s 
it said from 1981 to 1989 spending in this area increased just 12 
percent from 429 million to 481 million while the consumer 
price index rose 36 percent 
the researchers also criticized the occupational safety and 
health administration for often setting permissible workplace 
levels of air pollution and exposure to poisons higher than 
recommended by the national institute of occupational safety and 
health or permitted by the environmental protection agency for 
society at large they said 
it is outrageous for example that it is permissible for 
workers to be routinely exposed to levels of sulfur dioxide in the 
air that are over 62 times that which is considered a healthy level 
for nonworkers the researchers said 
the occupational safety and health administration is part of the 
labor department the national institute of occupational safety and 
health is part of the department of health and human services 
alan mcmillan deputy assistant labor secretary in charge of 
osha said the report overall raised important issues but he said 
he had not read the report thoroughly yet and could not comment 
further in detail 
however mcmillan said osha and the national institute of 
occupational safety and health face different legal requirements in 
setting exposure standards 
the institute is responsible for recommending safe exposure 
levels based solely on the workers health osha however must 
also consider technical feasibility and economic impact 
for that reason in most cases youll likely see a difference 
in an osha standard and a niosh recommendation he said

five new reserve units that will boost 
transport and public affairs activities in operation desert shield 
have been called to active duty according to the pentagon 
that brings to about 8870 the number of reservists called in 
the first wave of notifications pentagon spokesman pete williams 
said thursday 
the secretary of the air force has called three units 
68th military airlift squadron kelly afb texas with 228 
personnel involved in support of c5a transport planes 
301st military airlift squadron travis afb calif with 249 
personnel involved in support of c5a and c5b transports 
326th military airlift squadron dover afb del with 244 
personnel involved in support of c5a transports 
the secretary of the army has ordered to active duty the 
following units 
382nd public affairs detachment of the national guard from 
raleigh nc 
314th public affairs detachment of the army reserve from 
birmingham ala 
no personnel figures were given 
the pentagon announced last week that about 46700 reserves 
would be called to duty by oct 1 and that most of the parttime 
soldiers would be posted in or near saudi arabia 
at that time williams had projected that about 9800 reserves 
would be called to leave their civilian jobs by the end of august 
williams said fewer than expected have been called as the 
services have looked more carefully at the need for the reserves 
he gave the following breakdown for the call up by service 
army 4292 navy 2584 air force 1723 coast guard 271 no 
marine reserves have been called as expected williams added 
meanwhile sen lloyd bentsen chairman of the senate finance 
committee wrote defense secretary dick cheney on thursday asking 
that the pentagon take additional steps to protect the credit 
ratings of servicemen and women sent to the middle east 
the texas democrat said the 50yearold soldiers and sailors 
civil relief act merely protects newly activated personnel from 
foreclosures or repossessions of property in cases where their 
military activity caused late payments or interruptions in payments 
but bentsen said that law makes no provision for protecting the 
credit ratings of service personnel whose financial standing could 
be adversely affected by overseas military duty 
i believe you have authority under existing law to help 
military personnel who may face this situation the senator told 
cheney 
bentsen suggested that men and women activated for service duty 
be give an opportunity to authorize the defense department to 
notify credit bureaus that the persons military service may 
affect his or her ability to meet previously incurred financial 
obligations

infant mortality in the united states inched 
downward last year to the lowest level ever recorded but the us 
rate is still higher than many industrialized nations officials 
said 
although weve made progress in reducing this nations infant 
mortality we must do better health and human services secretary 
louis sullivan said thursday 
the provisional data released by the national center for health 
statistics would rank the united states below 21 industrialized 
countries on a list comparing 1986 rates center spokeswoman sandra 
smith said 
the ranking is probably still accurate she said 
we make progress but so do other countries she said 
the new data shows that us infant deaths for 1989 were 97 per 
1000 live births down from 99 per 1000 
the 1989 data for infant mortality was not broken down for 
blacks and whites but final data from 1987 shows that while white 
infant deaths amounted to 86 per 1000 the rate for blacks was 
179 
sullivan said the united states must continue to direct 
prevention education and health care opportunities to our minority 
and poor citizens where infant mortality strikes hardest

immigration authorities have been ordered by 
an administrative judge to deport members of a salvadoran family to 
a third country rather than their strifetorn nation 
a refugee advocacy lawyer hailed the ruling as an important step 
toward changing the governments policy of forcing aliens to return 
to homelands beset by civil war if they cant prove they are likely 
to be harmed 
what this decision stands for is an articulated justification 
under international law for a generic approach for providing 
protection to those who otherwise would be returned to a civil 
war arthur c helton director of the refugee project for the 
lawyers committee for human rights said thursday about the aug 24 
decision 
helton estimated there are as many as 500000 salvadorans living 
in the united states the ins last year granted 337 applications 
for asylum status while denying 13861 
its a promising decision and if upheld on appeal would have a 
substantial impact on us practice helton said but he conceded 
that the decision is based on international law rather than federal 
immigration law 
helton noted that an attempt by an immigration judge several 
years ago to invoke an international treaty to stop the deportation 
of salvadorans was overturned on appeal 
ins authorities are confident that the decision by immigration 
judge paul a nejelski would be overturned by the board of 
immigration appeals said an official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity

a capital gains tax reduction could not be

it is unlikely that the increase in income would generate

political storm clouds are gathering 
over the philippines creating the perception that president 
corazon aquinos government faces a grave and perhaps final crisis 
such fears have long plagued the aquino government which came 
to power in the heady days of the 1986 people power revolution 
that deposed the late president ferdinand marcos 
but in the past three weeks public confidence has plummeted 
rumors of a new coup attempt are rampant commentators believe the 
nation is facing a political showdown that may spell the end of 
philippine democracy 
four years after its restoration constitutional democracy in 
the philippines is heading toward collapse ahead of the end of 
president aquinos term in 1992 wrote amando doronila editor of 
the progovernment newspaper the manila chronicle 
the truth is that philippine democracy today is in imminent 
and mortal danger of being overthrown 
during four tumultuous years mrs aquinos government has 
weathered numerous crises including communist and moslem 
insurgencies and six coup attempts most recently last december 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait expected to increase oil prices 
a series of natural disasters and a spate of bombings have brought 
the nation to the brink of yet another crisis 
ive never seen anything like this said one western 
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity the public mood is 
just awful it seems like the government is tottering just waiting 
for a push 
following a meeting of newspaper executives most major manila 
dailies published frontpage appeals today to defend democracy 
against a new coup attempt 
but the daily malaya said the only way out of the crisis was for 
mrs aquino to resign and call new elections 
philippine presidents served fouryear terms under the 
constitution in effect when she took office but the constitution 
drafted under the aquino government granted presidents a single 
sixyear term 
given her demonstrable inability to govern the country 
needs new leadership malaya said 
in its editorial the manila standard said that while it opposes 
military rule the administration must recognize that the idea 
has gained some currency because the many crises that confront us 
seem to call for extreme solutions 
natural disasters include the july 16 earthquake which killed 
more than 1600 people typhoons and a devastating flood that 
dumped nearly three feet of rain on the capital aug 24 
the governments clumsy response to the tragedies highlighted 
the administrations failures in the business of governing 
earthquake recovery operations were hampered by poor 
communications and a lack of planning the torrential rains flooded 
large areas of manila because tons of uncollected garbage had 
clogged the drainage systems 
the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait threatens the jobs of more 
than 500000 filipino workers in the persian gulf region who pump

it also promises to raise fuel prices in a country that relied 
heavily on iraq and kuwait for oil in the philippines oil prices

the spate of bombings in manila 17 since aug 13 has 
prompted fears that military dissidents are poised for a new coup 
attempt one foreign businessman said on condition of anonymity 
that many people are no longer talking about whether there will 
be a coup but when 
faced with the crisis mrs aquino reversed a longstanding 
policy and said wednesday she was willing to negotiate a 
ceasefires with communist and military rebels the cabinet meets 
saturday to discuss prospects for a truce 
but there has been no clear statement from either military 
dissidents or the communist party on whether they would go along 
with a ceasefire 
furthermore political sources say defense secretary fidel ramos 
strongly opposes a truce saying it would undercut morale in the 
armed forces 
this apparent split has fueled rumors the armed forces may be 
planning a constitutional coup establishing some sort of 
militaryrun emergency commission that would run the country with 
mrs aquino as a figurehead 
ramos who crushed the six coup attempts has strongly denied 
the rumors and said thursday they were spread by dissidents to 
foment division in the government 
on thursday mrs aquinos national security adviser retired 
lt gen rafael ileto said he opposed military rule but he said 
martial law was a viable option if the very life of the state is 
at stake

connecticut has rediscovered a relic from 
its puritan past police this summer have charged four people with 
adultery 
in a state known for progressive laws on abortion rights 
education and the environment use of the rarely enforced state 
adultery law is raising eyebrows 
its a dinosaur said new haven attorney hugh keefe what 
a spouse needs if she has a cheating husband is a divorce lawyer 
not a cop 
under the law a married person commits adultery by having 
sexual intercourse with someone other than his or her spouse 
single people cannot be charged conviction on the misdemeanor 
charge carries up to a year in prison and a 1000 fine 
connecticut authorities say they have no choice but to enforce 
the law before this year just two people were charged with 
adultery since 1985 
the latest cluster of arrests is basically just a 
coincidence said chief states attorney john j kelly people 
have to realize that we do have a law on the books 
adultery as a criminal offense in america dates from the arrival 
of the puritans in massachusetts in the 17th century 
twentyseven states still have adultery laws on the books a 
survey by the harvard law review found but legal scholars say few 
states make much effort to enforce them for example in new york 
where adultery is a misdemeanor the last recorded prosecution was 
in 1944 
these laws never get repealed said ronald j allen a 
professor at northwestern university school of law in chicago 
what politician is going to come out in favor of adultery 
the first connecticut arrest this year occurred in norwich on 
june 1 when a man locked in a divorce battle claimed he witnessed 
his wife through a window of a house having sex with another man 
police said 
on tuesday police in east lyme arrested a man and a woman both 
married but not to each other after receiving a complaint from the 
mans wife 
police in new london made another arrest tuesday when they broke 
up a domestic squabble over a womans alleged infidelity and 
arrested the woman after she admitted having an affair 
for years divorce lawyers have used the law to keep their 
clients sexual affairs secret they can do that by having their 
clients invoke their fifth amendment rights against 
selfincrimination but lawyers say criminal application of the law 
is a different matter altogether 
what are we going to do with these people asked patty 
jenkins pittman a new haven lawyer put them on probation what 
would the probation be celibacy 
lou buonfiglio a private detective in new haven agreed i 
hope they dont have any witchburning statutes left on the 
books he said

a broken electronic part caused nasa 
to scrub saturdays scheduled launch of space shuttle columbia 
extending the bad luck that has dogged the space agency all year 
nasa officials waited until late thursday night before halting 
the countdown for a scientific mission that was to last nine or 10 
days another attempt wont be made before wednesday 
the culprit was in an electronic box that routes electrical 
power and telemetry between the spacecraft and an xray telescope 
mounted at the rear of its cargo bay 
the launch control center had been unable to issue commands to 
the telescope since the shuttles cargo bay doors were closed 
wednesday evening 
engineers suspected a cable might have been pinched and they 
sent technicians into the shuttle crew compartment to look at the 
electronic box with highpowered binoculars they saw nothing amiss 
another problem cropped up during the countdown that might also 
have been in a favorite nasa phrase a showstopper a 
middeck instrument that measures acceleration and vibration also 
was faulty now replacement is likely 
the space agency is under pressure to get the astro mission 
under way by midseptember because of the approaching launch of the 
shuttle discovery with a space probe that is to go into orbit 
around the sun 
for its long journey the ulysses probe needs a gravity boost 
gained by whipping around the planet jupiter earth and jupiter 
will be in proper alignment for that task between oct 5 and oct 
23 and not again for 13 months 
on columbia officials arent sure which of two components in 
the broadband xray telescope control box is at fault and the date 
of the next launch attempt depends on what they find when they 
enter the cargo bay this weekend nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said 
were looking at maybe routing a cable outside the electronic 
box which will give us a midweek launch she said if that 
doesnt solve the problem then well go inside the box to replace 
a component that would give us a weekend launch 
the postponement further damages nasas frayed shuttle schedule 
and its reputation the agency has suffered from the 
embarrassments of launching the fuzzyeyed hubble telescope 
inandout communications with the magellan spacecraft orbiting 
venus damaging reports about its proposed space station and two 
leaky shuttles 
columbia had been scheduled to be launched on the astro mission 
on may 30 but that attempt was scratched when the hydrogen leak 
was discovered during fueling later the shuttle atlantis also was 
found to leak and the fleet was grounded 
the space agency had hoped to launch nine shuttle flights this 
year to date there have been only three 
when it finally lifts off columbia will have a crew of seven 
the largest since the challenger accident on jan 28 1986 four of 
the crewmen are astronomers who have trained for the event since 
the early 1980s 
they were to have flown with the observatory in march 1986 in 
time to study the comet halley then returning from a 76year round 
trip through the universe 
but the challenger explosion on jan 28 1986 stopped all 
mannedspace activity for 32 months and the mission was put in line 
behind higherpriority flights 
once in space the four telescopes on the 150 million 
observatory will view some of the hottest objects in the universe 
chronicling the life cycles of stars by measuring their radiation 
scientists promise that the observatory will make measurements 
never before possible with groundbased telescopes 
we really want a success said ed weiler who is the nasa 
scientist in charge of the astro project as well as that of the 
hubble telescope 
we really want the public to know we can do space astronomy 
and we can do it right and its something worth doing he said 
the hubble problems really give scientists more motivation to be 
successful on this mission

z the author of a provocative article 
arguing that mikhail gorbachevs reforms are doomed is martin 
malia a russian historian at the university of california at 
berkeley 
malia unmasked himself in an opinion page article in todays new 
york times his controversial article appeared in the winter issue 
of daedalus published by the american academy of arts and 
sciences excerpts appeared in the times in january 
the article argued that gorbachev was pursuing only halfway 
measures that would not reform the soviet union which labors under 
the twin burdens of centuries of russian authoritarianism and 70 
years of communist totalitarianism 
the article was viewed as flying in the face of the support that 
the united states was giving to gorbachevs policies 
malia a specialist on 19th century russian intellectual 
history said he signed the article n perestroikin an obscure 
allusion to vladimir lenins pseudonym but the n signature was 
changed to z in the editing process 
malia wrote that he had decided to remain anonymous so he 
wouldnt compromise his friends in the soviet union and because 
the fall of the berlin wall and central european communism had 
not yet demonstrated that leninist regimes are mortal 
malia said the pseudonym was no longer necessary because 
communism has been defeated in the soviet union 
it is manifest that the soviet union modestly aligning itself 
with the us and the united nations is no longer a superpower 
he wrote in the times 
less obviously this is so because the soviet union no longer 
exists as one now hears in moscow either as a coherent polity or 
economy and this stunning fact will weigh on world affairs for 
years after the persian gulf crisis 
he cited the march elections that brought to power soviet 
reformers such as boris yeltsin who advocate a transition from 
totalitarianism to a civil society by dismantling most of the 
system as structured by the communists 
they also call for a pluralistic democracy reinstatement of 
private property and even independence for soviet republics 
in short in the past six months the soviet union has gone the 
way of central europe during six weeks last year malia wrote 
it has been a slowmotion implosion just as portentous as the 
collapse as the berlin wall 
speculation about the identity of z had been rampant in 
academic and government circles some had focused on malia 
others suspected were zbigniew brzezinski former national 
security adviser under president carter former secretary of state 
henry kissinger and retired lt gen william odom former head of 
the national security agency

americans will be urged to drive more 
fuelefficient cars and obey speed limits when the federal 
government starts its first energyconservation advertising 
campaign in more than a decade 
if all americans took those and other steps the country could 
save 200000 barrels of oil a day energy secretary james d 
watkins told the new york times in an interview published today 
the new conservation campaign is set to start in midseptember 
watkins said he said it is a response to the persian gulf crisis 
at the same time the government will boost domestic oil 
production watkins told the times 
before the united nations embargo went into effect the united 
states imported about 700000 barrels of oil a day from iraq and 
kuwait onethird of that deficit will be resolved by december by 
increasing production from prudhoe bay in alaska watkins said 
the energy department also is seeking another 30000 barrels a 
day from texas and 50000 barrels more from companies that have 
developed oil reserves off the coast of santa barbara calif 
watkins said the bush administration would try to mediate a 
dispute between california santa barbara county and oil companies 
over how crude petroleum is to be transported to shore as well as 
being an environmentally delicate area the coastline is an 
important tourist attraction 
the department also will encourage the use of gasoline that 
includes alcohol or methanol which could save 10000 barrels of 
oil a day if millions more drivers used the fuel

an official of the rev billy grahams 
organization which has escaped the scandals that have dogged other 
ministries has been accused of improperly influencing an elderly 
donor a published report said today 
the allegation was made by a canadian womans heirs who sought 
a larger share of the 3 million estate of their great aunt the 
washington post reported the newspaper said the claim had been 
settled before going to trial 
the billy graham evangelistic association had stood to gain more 
than onethird of jessie geneva lattas estate through a foundation 
named for latta and established by carl w green 
the 63yearold green left his post as a senior canadian 
fundraiser for the graham organization last year the post said 
lattas will was contested by four of her six heirs three 
greatnieces and a great nephew who said in a claim settled in 
brockville ontario monday that green began to gain lattas 
confidence more than 10 years ago after her husband died and while 
she was in her 80s brockville is across the st lawrence river 
from new york 
the heirs accused green of improperly influencing latta to 
rewrite wills in which she had left more money to the heirs than 
was specified in the contested will 
the newspaper said a graham association spokesman denied the 
allegations and green could not be reached for comment 
im very pleased said dianne hickling one of the 
contesting heirs we accomplished what we set out to do 
the case was settled after the heirs produced reports from green 
to his superiors in which he detailed repeated visits with latta 
in the reports included in the settlement green noted lattas 
increasing dependence on him and his certainty that she would 
funnel a significant amount of money to the graham organization 
under the settlement half of lattas estate was awarded to the 
heirs and half to the foundation with the stipulation that hickling 
replace green as a director 
the graham organization received no money in the settlement and 
the heirs were allowed to seek retrieval of about 750000 in gifts 
from latta to the graham association before she died in 1988 at age 
93 a 100000 bequest to the association remains in dispute

researchers have identified a chemical compound 
contaminating some batches of the food supplement ltryptophan 
which has killed 27 and sickened hundreds 
the compound was discovered during chromatography tests of 
contaminated ltryuptophan the national centers for disease 
control said thursday 
cdc researchers said they still dont know exactly how the 
contaminant got in the product they also have yet to determine 
whether the chemical compound is itself the cause of the illness or 
just a marker of another substance 
another advance in tracing the cause of the rare blood disorder 
called eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome or ems was reported at the 
national institute of mental health in bethesda md a model of the 
disorder was reproduced there in rats 
nationwide cdc has received reports of 1536 cases of ems 
which has been linked to consumption of ltryptophan an amino 
acid but the cdc said the number of cases may be higher as many 
ems cases dont meet the official case definition but still appear 
to be related to ltryptophan 
maybe our figures might be missing half the cases id say 
3000 to 5000 is a reasonably good estimate said dr edwin 
kilbourne chief of health studies at the cdcs center for 
environmental health 
twentyseven patients have died from ems whose symtoms include 
pains fever rash and shortness of breath 
the food and drug administration ordered all ltryptophan 
products off the market this spring the products were sold through 
health food stores as a remedy for conditions including weight 
problems sleeplessness and depression 
the chemical compound is known as a ditryptophan aminal of 
acetaldehyde it was identified in trace amounts in 
chromatography tests of 50 lots of ltryptophan produced by the 
implicated manufacturer said dr larry needham toxicology chief 
for the cdcs center for environmental health 
reports have identified the manufacturer as japans showa denko 
kk 
its an impurity needham said its not supposed to be in 
the product 
lab investigations have found no signs of bacteria or viruses 
contaminating the product but data indicate that implicated 
ltryptophancontaining products were contaminated with the 
chemical compound the cdc said after nearly a year of 
investigation 
a new england journal of medicine report earlier this month 
concluded showa denko whose product has been linked to most cases 
made two changes in manufacturing which could have caused the 
problem introduction of a new strain of genetically altered 
bacteria and alteration of its filtering process

archrivals north and south korea have 
set the details for historic talks between their prime ministers 
opening the way for negotiations on easing four decades of 
hostilities officials said today 
north korean prime minister yon hyong muk and about 90 others 
are scheduled to cross the heavily fortified border on tuesday for 
two days of talks with south korean officials the information 
ministry said 
it will be the highestlevel contact between the communist north 
and capitalist south since the korean peninsula was divided in 
1945 and security was expected to be tight for the talks to be 
held on wednesday and thursday 
about 3000 police will ring the hotel where south korean prime 
minister kang younghoon and his north korean counterpart will 
meet the ministry said 
thousands more police will be posted around government buildings 
and along routes where the delegations are expected to travel 
police said 
it was agreed that a second round of talks will be held in the 
north korean capital of pyongyang oct 1619 the ministry said 
travel plans and other details were finalized late thursday 
between officials of the two koreas meeting in panmunjom a border 
village inside the demilitarized zone that separates the two 
nations 
the north korean delegation consisting of eight delegates 33 
assistants and 50 reporters will walk over the border into the 
south at panmunjom and will be driven the 35 miles to the south 
korean capital 
the communist delegation is scheduled to leave south korea on 
sept 7 
although south korean officials attach great significance to the 
talks observers doubt substantial progress will be made in the 
talks because the premiers of both nations are mostly figureheads 
without policymaking roles 
north korea has said the talks should cover mainly ways to ease 
political and military tensions south korean officials insist 
priority be given to nonpolitical exchanges to promote mutual 
confidence 
north korea has proposed drastic arms reductions cutting the 
troop level to 100000 each north korea has more than 1 million 
troops while south korea has 650000 
the north koreans also demand withdrawal of the 43000 us 
troops stationed in south korea under a mutual defense treaty but 
south korea opposes any drastic measures such as arms cuts before 
an extended period of confidencebuilding 
in an unprecedented move south korea proposed an unrestricted 
fiveday border opening in midaugust for the 62 million residents 
of the two koreas but north korea failed to meet seoul officials to 
discuss the matter 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
capitalist south in 1945 the nations fought a threeyear war in 
the early 1950s their border is sealed and direct communication 
between their peoples is forbidden

the united states for the first time 
has joined with other nations in declaring that human activity is 
causing global warming in a unsponsored conference that ended 
early today 
after four days of meetings to consider the most extensive 
scientific investigation of the earths climate the 74 delegations 
unanimously adopted a report that will be a basis for negotiations 
on future climate treaties 
the intergovernmental panel on climate changes spent two years 
preparing the document under the auspices of the un environment 
program and the world meteorological organization 
scientists and environmentalists described the consensus as a 
breakthrough because the united states for the first time 
acknowledged human activity is producing gases that are changing 
the climate and warming the globe 
but agreement on the future impact of global warming and 
recommendations on possible action to prevent it were not achieved 
at the conference 
as far as effective action and impacts the report is weak 
said jeremy legget science director for greenpeace international 
but the significant achievement is that finally the united states 
has acknowledged the global warming is actually happening 
fred bernthal head of the national science foundation and the 
american delegation said late thursday that us acceptance of 
global warming theories in the document marked a step forward in 
climate policy 
we are certain of the following emissions resulting from 
human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric 
concentrations of the greenhouse gases bernthal said 
all things being equal it the greenhouse effect might lead 
to global warming he said 
bernthal said there is still uncertainty about the magnitude of 
the problem and questions about when and where the effects would 
be felt 
the united states the largest producer of carbon dioxide has 
blocked any international agreement to place mandatory restrictions 
on emission of the gases that lead to the socalled greenhouse 
effect 
carbon dioxide produced from the burning of fossil fuels such 
as oil and coal helps trap warm air around the earth scientists 
say 
the meeting was marked by extensive argument behind closed doors 
between the americans who insisted more research is needed and 
european nations committed to an international agreement on 
restricting carbon dioxide emissions 
the scientific conclusions will form the basis for discussions 
at the november climate convention in geneva the scientists said 
they hoped an agreement on action will be ready for signing at the 
june 1992 un conference on environment and development in brazil

us officials are compiling a list of 
alleged violations of international law to use against iraqi 
president saddam hussein in a nurembergstyle war crimes trial a 
newspaper reported today 
the bush administration could cite the alleged violations to 
justify any military action against iraq according to 
administration sources quoted by the los angeles times 
the administration also might make the capture of saddam and his 
key advisers for trial one of the objectives of the us buildup in 
the persian gulf officials told the times 
some legal action has to be taken both because we have a 
right to bring him to justice and to deter him from further 
violations said an administration official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
in the short term administration officials said the preparation 
of charges was intended to deter saddam from taking further action 
against thousands of civilian hostages in iraq and kuwait 
the report did not state whether plans were being made for 
saddams capture or in what venue the administration would want to 
try the iraqi leader 
among the alleged violations cited by officials is that saddam 
has waged a war of aggression by invading kuwait on aug 2 that 
charge formed the basis of the war crimes trials of nazi leaders in 
nuremberg after world war ii 
other possible allegations include using chemical weapons 
taking hostages kidnapping diplomats violating embassies and 
holding captives at military installations officials said 
those actions constitute violations of the 1949 geneva 
convention and the 1973 new york convention protecting embassies 
diplomats and their families the officials said 
saddam has really put himself in a situation of dire jeopardy 
by using civilians said abraham d sofaer a former state 
department legal adviser its a clear violation of the laws of 
war to intentionally expose civilians for military purposes is a 
clear violation of the geneva convention

proof borja said thursday on nationwide television and radio 
if they do i will present my resignation to the ecuadorian 
people but if they do not i will exercise my powers as president

nancy cruzans parents again are 
seeking satisfaction from the legal system that has blocked their 
threeyear battle to let the comatose woman die 
joe and joyce cruzan say they have new evidence that their 
33yearold daughter wouldnt want to continue living in her 
condition 
nancy cruzan has been in a persistent vegetative state since a 
january 1983 car crash and is kept alive at a state hospital by a 
surgically implanted feeding tube 
three witnesses have come forth who had specific discussions 
with nancy cruzan regarding her wishes about lifesustaining 
medical treatment attorney bill colby who represents the 
parents and their daughter said in a petition filed thursday with 
charles teel a jasper county probate judge 
no date for a hearing was immediately set colby said 
in july in its first ruling in a righttodie case the 
us supreme court barred the removal of the lifesustaining tube 
it said a states interest in preserving life may overcome the 
wishes of family members seeking to end the life of a patient in an 
irreversible comalike condition 
i feel this is a wrong that has to be righted joe cruzan 
said in an interview from his home in carterville in southwest 
missouri we dont feel this is right for every family but we 
feel were doing what nancy would want 
i dont know where its going to end he said i hope 
were successful i gave up being enthusiastic a long time ago 
when i learned the legal system doesnt work very fast 
in thursdays petition colby said the supreme court ruled the 
discovery of new evidence regarding the patients intent could 
allow for modification or reversal of the ban on removing her 
feeding tube

clear and convincing evidence as a legal standard of proof of 
ms cruzans wishes before medical treatment is terminated 
colby declined in an interview to disclose the identities of the 
three people other than to say two were people ms cruzan had 
worked for and the third was a coworker the conversations took 
place about three years before the car crash he said 
missouri attorney general william webster who handled the 
states challenges to the cruzan family had no immediate comment 
on the filing said his spokeswoman mary jenkins 
cruzan said of his legal battles i feel frustrated and some 
degree of anger but primarily frustration at the system 
the 55yearold sheetmetal worker said he considered taking his 
daughter to a state that might allow termination of artificial 
feeding but rejected the idea because i thought it was wrong

the dollar rose against the japanese yen and stocks 
closed higher today despite the previous days increase in japans 
official discount rate 
the dollar finished the week at 14450 yen up 040 yen from 
thursdays finish the us currency opened at 14445 yen and 
ranged between 14413 yen and 14455 yen 
the dollar gained despite thursdays discount rate hike because 
the increase was smaller than expected said yoshitsugu hanada a 
dealer with mitsui taiyo kobe bank 
on thursday the bank of japan raised its official discount 
rate its lending rate to commercial banks to 6 percent from the 
previous 525 percent effective immediately 
local media and financial markets had expected the bank would 
raise the rate by as much as 1 percentage point 
higher interest rates generally make a nations currency more 
attractive to investors and discourage stock purchasers 
investors have sold the dollar for a while because of the lack 
of developments in the middle east crisis but i think the dollars 
downtrend has reversed hanada said 
the us currency is frequently seen as a safe haven in times of 
crisis and earlier worry about the gulf situation had sent it 
higher despite basic concerns about the us economy traders said 
market players were buying the us currency to make up for 
their recent oversold positions hanada said 
trading was inactive with about 7 billion trading hands in 
spot dealings 
investors were reluctant to make major moves ahead of a 
threeday weekend in new york dealers said us financial markets 
will be closed monday for labor day 
on the stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average gained 
30841 points or 12 percent ending the day at 2597837 the 
index rose 77517 points on thursday following the announcement of 
the discount rate increase trading was moderate with 600 million 
shares traded on the first section 
stock prices started lower today with many investors 
discouraged by an overnight decline in the dow jones industrial 
average and the yens downturn against the dollar traders said 
they said the index started recovering as institutional 
investors made arbitrage purchases in the spot market to take 
profits from the price gap between spot and futures values 
kozo hasunuma a trader with yamaichi securities co said 
bargain hunting also helped the index today 
but selling by some investors to reduce holdings before the 
weekend prevented the index from rising further he said 
satoru nagayoshi a trader with new japan securities co said 
stability in the bond market reassured investors and helped support 
the stock market 
in bond dealings the yield of benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds closed at 8105 percent down from 
thursdays 8120 percent their price rose to 8307 from 8300

a tornadowarning radar system had been disabled 
by lightning hours before killer twisters struck several towns in 
northern illinois a national weather service forecaster said today 
but the forecaster said he didnt believe the system could have 
forecast the tornadoes that killed 27 people and injured more than 
300 tuesday across a region known as tornado alley about 35 
miles southwest of chicago 
the weather services chicago office issued a severe 
thunderstorm warning for the area but did not alert residents to 
the tornadoes until six minutes after they had touched down in the 
communities of plainfield and crest hill 
the office is equipped with an early version of doppler radar 
which might have provided five to 10 minutes advance warning of the 
twisters said forecaster carl williams 
but theres just no way that you can say that it could have 
done that williams said in a telephone interview its a 
primitive system and i dont think its being out had any effect at 
all 
williams said the doppler radar has not been in wide use in most 
weather service offices but an addon doppler was installed in 
1974 on radar equipment dating back to 1957 
but the doppler radar in chicago was knocked out by lightning 
hours before tuesdays storms 
the doppler system can detect both those winds that are 
approaching and moving away when winds are detected moving in both 
directions at the same time and at high speeds meteorologists can 
quickly determine that they are dealing with a tornado 
a newer system called nexrad is being tested at the weather 
services national severe storms laboratory officials said but 
that system may not be installed until 1995 williams said 
the new york times reported today that the weather service has 
dispatched a team of researchers from the national severe storms 
laboratory at norman okla to assess the effectiveness of its 
forecasters and timeliness of the alerts they issued tuesday 
we will do a complete assessment of the event robert 
maddox director of the laboratory told the newspaper we will 
look at the weather observations and the data available to forecast 
offices and if the team can agree on them we will offer 
recommendations for improvements 
calls to the oklahoma lab went unanswered early today

a federal appeals court overturned wayne 
newtons record 52 million libel judgment saying the jury didnt 
prove nbc news was deliberately false or reckless in suggesting the 
singer had ties to the mob 
in dismissing newtons lawsuit the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals ruled 30 thursday that any false impressions in the 1980 
broadcast did not result from the type of journalistic misconduct 
required for libel lawsuits by public figures 
the us supreme court has ruled public figures must prove that 
defamatory statements were either deliberate falsehoods or 
recklessly disregarded the truth 
newtons lawyer morton galane said he would not comment until 
he could reach newton 
a jury in las vegas found that nbcs story falsely implied that 
the mafia had helped newton buy the aladdin hotel and casino in 
exchange for a hidden interest 
it awarded newton 193 million but that was reduced to 52 
million mostly in punitive damages after us district judge 
myron crocker found that newtons income and reputation had not 
suffered 
thursdays ruling said most of the broadcasts factual 
statements were true newton had a friend with purported mob ties 
who had done him a favor and had then talked with an associate 
about the possibility of profiting from newtons ownership of the 
aladdin a federal grand jury had investigated that subject and 
newton had testified falsely to the nevada gaming board 
although the broadcast did not specify the favor that had been 
done for newton according to newton getting a criminal 
organization to stop threatening him and his daughter the court 
said the omission was not libelous the reporters had reason to 
doubt the story of the threats which had been denied by newtons 
lawyer in newtons presence the court said 
among the reasons nbc gave for challenging the verdict was 
crockers refusal to transfer the trial out of las vegas where an 
annual wayne newton day is celebrated and a street is named after 
him 
wayne newtons case poses the danger that first amendment 
values will be subverted by a local jury biased in favor of a 
prominent local public said the opinion by judge william norris 
i dont think the jury was as much biased against nbc as it 
was prone to support wayne newton floyd abrams a prominent 
libel lawyer representing nbc said thursday he said the decision 
would not have been rendered outside of las vegas 
nbc news president michael gartner called the ruling a sound 
victory for investigative journalism

the arab league has urged member nations 
with ideas for a diplomatic way out of the persian gulf crisis to 
come forward and said any settlement of the crisis must include 
iraqs withdrawal from kuwait 
but arab diplomatic sources said the league would likely be 
unable to come up with a viable diplomatic solution to the 
monthold conflict in its twoday emergency session at which eight 
of 21 members were absent 
arab foreign ministers were expected to end the meeting today by 
condemning for a second time iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and 
demanding baghdads immediate and unconditional withdrawal from its 
oilrich neighbor iraq has declared kuwait part of its territory 
the sources said the main aim of the meeting was to embarrass 
iraqi president saddam hussein for ignoring the aug 10 appeal by 
arab leaders at the cairo summit 
at the summit 12 arab nations also said they regarded the 
deposed emir of kuwait as the nations legitimate ruler and agreed 
to send troops to saudi arabia to protect it against a possible 
iraqi invasion 
egypt syria and morocco have sent small troop contingents to 
coordinate with us and other forces countering iraq in the 
persian gulf region 
under arab league rules resolutions accepted by simple 
majorities are binding only on members voting for them 
league secretarygeneral chadli klibi said thursdays meeting 
had reviewed reports on efforts by some arabs to achieve a 
settlement 
he was apparently referring to peace proposals by the palestine 
liberation organization kuwait has rejected that initiative 
because it involves some form of federation between kuwait and iraq 
other arabs states included jordan and sudan are involved in 
diplomatic efforts 
in its statement thursday the league asked any members with 
peace initiatives to propose them but said any solution must 
involve both an iraqi withdrawal and restoration of kuwaits 
deposed government 
klibi read the statement to reporters following a threehour 
meeting of officials from 13 arab league nations 
in addition to iraq those staying away were jordan sudan 
yemen algeria tunisia mauritania and the plo they all opposed 
abstained or expressed reservations in the vote on the summit 
resolution 
the ministers thursday formed a sixnation committee to draft a 
resolution the panel comprised of bahrain libya kuwait egypt 
syria and saudi arabia 
syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa said the committee also 
would look at the initiatives taken by some arab countries 
attending the conference were the 12 league members who 
supported the summit resolution plus libya the 12 were egypt 
syria saudi arabia kuwait qatar bahrain the united arab 
emirates oman morocco lebanon somalia and djibouti 
libya had been expected to boycott the ministerial meeting 
egyptian officials said cairo requested the ministerial session 
in line with a stipulation of the summit resolution that klibi 
report within 15 days on its implementation

a liberian rebel leader claims his 
forces hold several thousand citizens of countries participating in 
the fivenation west african force sent to liberia to end the 
tribal war 
a force of 3000 men from nigeria ghana sierra leone guinea 
and gambia landed in monrovias port last weekend the force hopes 
to end the 8monthold war between president samuel doe and two 
rebel factions 
one rebel leader charles taylor opposed the force and attacked 
it shortly after its arrival reporters traveling with the force 
say the rebels were driven off by the task forces heavy weaponry 
taylor who on thursday telephoned the british broadcasting 
corp in london from liberia said he is holding nationals of 
countries participating in the multinational force 
what we are we doing right now is not unlike what other 
countries have had to do to protect the lives of citizens of 
countries involved in wars with other countries taylor said 
the rebel leader said his rebels evacuated several thousand 
people mostly nigerians and ghanaians from frontline areas to 
stop angry mobs of liberians from killing them it is for their 
security and for our security 
taylor denied he had threatened to kill the foreign nationals if 
any of his rebels were killed by the force but said he could not be 
expected to kiss nigerians on the cheek 
taylor said what i am saying to you is that i am not going to 
tolerate any nation coming into liberia and killing liberians 
meanwhile a conference of opposition groups churchmen and 
business leaders meeting in banjul gambia was expected to make a 
recommendation on who should head any interim government pending 
fresh elections 
leaders of the fivenation military force have said an interim 
government would be installed as soon as fighting ended neither 
taylor the second rebel leader prince johnson nor doe would be 
in the government the leaders said 
taylors forces invaded from neighboring ivory coast in december 
and advanced largely unchecked until they reached the outskirts of 
the capital of monrovia they have been unable to dislodge troops 
loyal to doe johnsons rebels who split with taylor have taken 
control of much of the capital 
johnson and doe have agreed to a truce and both support efforts 
to end the war they both want the resignation of doe

a man convicted of five murders was put to 
death by injection early today for killing an elderly woman 11 
years ago 
george c gilmore 44 was declared dead at 1210 am at the 
maximumsecurity potosi correctional center 
he had no last words said prison spokesman dale riley 
a brother a niece and a fiancee who were not identified wept 
and covered their faces with their hands as officials announced the 
fatal delivery of sodium pentothal pavlon and potassium chloride 
into a tube in gilmores arm 
strapped to a gurney and covered to his chin by a blanket 
gilmore strained at first to see his friends and mouthed what 
appeared to be i love you 
then he turned his head to the side and was still two minutes 
later he was declared dead 
gilmore was executed for killing 83yearold mary luella watters 
in august 1979 he also had received the death sentence for three 
other murders and was given a life prison term for a fourth 
his partner in crime leonard laws was executed may 17 
authorities say gilmore and laws killed five people in a st 
louisarea crime spree targeting elderly or helpless people for 
robbery and murder 
law enforcement officials expressed little sympathy for gilmore 
richard d moore director of the state department of 
corrections told official witnesses that the method of execution 
was humane and a far cry from the terror and horror george 
gilmore put each of his victims through 
its pretty sad when it takes 11 years said st louis 
county prosecutor george buzz westfall 
a series of appeals thursday failed to stop the execution the 
137th nationwide and the fifth in missouri since the us supreme 
court in 1976 let states resume use of the death penalty 
the us supreme court refused by a 61 vote to block gilmores 
death justice thurgood marshall who opposes the death penalty in 
all circumstances dissented justice antonin scalia did not take 
part in the case 
us district court judge edward l filippine and the us 8th 
circuit court of appeals also dismissed gilmores appeals thursday 
appeals filed for gilmore by lawyers kevin collins and james 
delworth alleged mitigating evidence had not been considered 
earlier gilmore the son of two alcoholics suffered fetal alcohol 
syndrome and organic brain damage delworth said 
missouri attorney general william websters office rejected 
those arguments

despite earlier reports of 
catandmouse maneuvers us navy officers say american and iraqi 
fighters have been steering clear of each other and are careful not 
to cross boundary lines 
officers aboard the aircraft carrier independence said thursday 
that us navy forces were operating cautiously so as not to 
provoke a confrontation as the united nations tries to negotiate a 
resolution to the standoff caused by iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
us pilots are stopping short of waters off kuwait and iraqi 
pilots appear to be staying well behind kuwaiti and iraqi borders 
as well said rear adm jerry unruh commander of the uss 
independence battle group f14 and f18 jets launched from the 
independence are conducting missions in the gulf 
iraq has also not lately taken any steps that would indicate 
hostile intentions he said unruh attributed iraqi leader 
saddam husseins strategy to the strong deterrent forces in the 
region and economic sanctions on iraq 
last week there were reports american pilots locked their 
weapons radar on iraqi planes in what one crew chief described as 
a little catandmouse although they said the iraqis had 
refused go along with the game 
the reports were not confirmed by the pentagon or by us 
commanders in saudi arabia 
unruh spoke to a group of reporters aboard the independence a 
forrestallclass aircraft carrier stationed just south of the gulf 
the f14s and f18s are being launched north into the gulf to 
protect other naval vessels patrolling the area 
unruh said iraq has exocet and silkworm missiles in kuwait but 
we have no indication that they are ready to employ them for use 
against our ships or aircraft 
as for the embargo unruh said us british and french ships 
surrounding the arabian peninsula were tracking 5075 ships a day 
in their efforts to block any commercial ships from leaving iraq 
and any ships except those carrying medicine from delivering goods 
to iraq 
unruh said there were few problems associated with the crowded 
airspace in the gulf area which in addition to commercial traffic 
includes hundreds of military jets and transports used for the 
multinational defense of saudi arabia 
but one of the carriers squadron leaders said fighter pilots 
were carrying fewer long range missiles on their missions because 
they wanted to make visual identification of all targets 
one of our worries is fratricide said commander sel 
laughter of the black knights f14 squadron 
another squadron commander dave nickle paused when asked how 
he would feel if assigned to attack an iraqi target knowing the 
site might also be the holding place of western hostages 
nickle glanced down at the floor for several seconds before 
saying our job is to go hit that target and thats what were 
going to do somebody else has to worry about hostages

authorities said a woman 
illegally injected liquid silicone into the breasts of several 
women one of whom may have to go undergo a mastectomy 
authorities are looking for sookie y ricketts 42 who is 
charged with two misdemeanor counts of practicing medicine without 
a license district attorney john suthers said thursday 
an arrest warrant was issued aug 6 for ricketts 42 whose last 
known address was in marietta ga he said 
ricketts allegedly charged several women thousands of dollars 
each to perform the procedure at her colorado springs home in late 
may suthers said 
it was the equivalent of a tupperware party he said 
doctors in the united states discontinued use of silicone 
injections in the 1960s and now use sealed bags of sterile 
silicone or saline said dr lawrence ketch chief of plastic and 
reconstructive surgery at the university of colorado health 
sciences center 
silicone that is injected is likely to break up and move to 
other parts of the body causing grotesque and sometimes painful 
lumps under the skin ketch said 
the practice of having an unlicensed person inject unpurified 
silicone into the body is accepted in many countries but is 
illegal in this country he said 
a woman who sold a diamond ring worth thousands of dollars to 
pay for the treatment suffered an acute infection several days 
after being injected by ricketts ketch said she was treated with 
antibiotics he said 
its not life threatening to her but sooner or later she will 
have to have her breast removed ketch said

doctors will wait until at least next year 
before attempting a bone marrow transplant from a baby conceived as 
a possible donor for her leukemiastricken sister 
doctors had said 5monthold marissa eve ayala could safely 
donate sufficient bone marrow for her 18yearold sister anissa 
as early as 6 months of age 
but a decision was made to wait until early 1991 to give the 
12pound marissa time to grow and because her sisters leukemia is 
stabilized 
as long as anissas leukemia remains stable physicians would 
prefer to let marissa grow and mature until about a year of age 
charlie mathews spokesman for the city of hope medical center 
said thursday 
the decision by mary and abe ayala to have a baby as a potential 
donor for their daughter drew attention from medical ethicists who 
voiced concern about creating one child to save another 
waiting until marissa is larger will allow for the extraction of 
more bone marrow there is little risk for the baby doctors have 
said 
mrs ayala said doctors had suggested performing the marrow 
transplant in december but the family wanted to wait until after 
christmas 
the chance that a bone marrow transplant will cure anissa of the 
leukemia a cancer of white blood cells has been reported as 
between 70 percent and 80 percent the family had been unable to 
find a suitable donor 
fetal cells withdrawn during amniocentesis prebirth testing 
showed virtually 100 percent that marissa would be a perfect 
match for anissa mathews said

iraq is trying to find a port that will accept its cargo a 
shipping newspaper said today 
lloyds list international said pacific international lines of 
singapore owner of the kota wirama intended to make a second

a reputed leader of captors holding 
westerners in lebanon said recent actions by european nations could 
hasten the release of some european hostages a newspaper reported 
today 
the addiyar newspaper quoted hussein musawi saying factions 
holding six americans and seven europeans distinguish between 
the stance of the united states and some european countries 
regarding events in the mideast since the aug 2 iraqi invasion of 
kuwait 
musawi who heads a prosyrian wing of the fundamentalist 
hezbollah or party of god also cited britains acknowledgment 
that the satanic verses novel could offend moslems and frances 
release of a lebanese prisoner accused of trying to assassinate an 
iranian diplomat 
moslem factions concerned with the european and american 
hostages distinguish between the american and european stands 
the newspaper quoted musawi as saying 
he gave no indication when any hostages might be freed but 
noted europeans would be in a more favorable position than 
others 
hezbollah irans closest ally in lebanon is believed to have 
links to factions holding six americans four britons two west 
germans and an italian 
three european hostages have been freed in recent weeks two 
american hostages frank reed and robert polhill were freed in 
april 
swiss red cross workers elio erriquez and emanuel christen were 
freed earlier this month they were kidnapped in south lebanon oct 
6 1989 
brian keenan a teacher with dual irishbritish citizenship was 
released aug 24 after nearly 4 years in captivity 
french president francois mitterrand recently released anis 
naccache who was serving a life sentence for the 1980 attempted 
assassination of former iranian prime minister shahpour bakhtiar in 
paris 
british officials this month noted that salman rushdies the 
satanic verses could be offensive to moslems ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini issued a death sentence on rushdie in february 1989 for 
blaspheming the moslem religion in the book rushdie has been in 
hiding 
musawi said that such stands would undoubtedly be understood 
as goodwill gestures by the europeans and therefore it must 
affect positively the situation of the european hostages 
musawi said in a telephone interview with the associated press 
on aug 16 that he believed no american hostages would be freed 
because of the us military intervention in the gulf 
after iraq invaded kuwait and massed tens of thousands of 
soldiers on the saudi border the united states began deploying 
troops to defend saudi arabia

jordanian military planes are flying spy 
missions along the saudi border to supply iraq with information on 
troop movements an israeli military source said today 
the source who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
said the jordanian reconnaissance flights are being flown by 
usmade f5 jets giving a view of troop movements dozens of 
miles into saudia arabia 
the source described the areas reportedly being watched by the 
jordanian craft as sectors along the saudijordan border that iraq 
cannot cover without being obvious or risking confrontation 
it said jordanian military aircraft also have stepped up flights 
along the jordanianisraeli border to watch for israeli troop 
movements 
throughout the persian gulf crisis israel has warned that any 
entry by iraqi troops into jordan would bring israeli military 
retaliation 
prime minister yitzhak shamir meanwhile warned iraq today 
against attempting to strike israel president chaim herzog tried 
to calm public fears by saying the iraqi army is not the mighty 
monster it is made out to be 
they were reacting to an iraqi air force commanders threat a 
day earlier of dealing smashing blows to the nests of the 
israelis 
also a leading israeli military analyst said the latest threat 
marked an escalation in the war of words with iraq and called for a 
reassessment of the dangers facing the jewish state 
up until now israel considered an iraqi attack only a low 
probability said zeev schiff military writer for the hebrew 
daily haaretz now we have to reassess and consider an iraqi 
attack on israel as an act of desperation 
he added although saddam hussein has up until now only 
threatened to attack israel if israel attacks him now the iraqis 
are announcing that in the event of a war they will attack israel 
missiles and planes even if israel doesnt lift a finger 
israel has been keeping a low profile since the gulf crisis was 
set off aug 2 with the iraqi invasion of kuwait but it has also 
made it clear that it is worried about the iraqi threat and 
prepared to handle any iraqi aggression 
israel fears that any settlement in the gulf may leave saddam in 
place where he will continue to be a threat to the jewish state 
officials here also have objected to planned arms sales to saudi 
arabia saying that the sales of usmade fighter jets tanks and 
stinger antiaircraft missiles would reduce israels qualitative 
edge in middle east weaponry 
the crisis is expected to be a topic of discussion wednesday in 
washington between foreign minister david levy and secretary of 
state james a baker iii 
the jerusalem post said partial answers have been received 
on enhancing us weapons packages for israel which receives 18 
billion a year in us military aid 
shamir warned saddam that any aggressor would live to regret 
his actions 
herzog in the text of a speech to be broadcast nationwide 
today urged the public to remain calm 
true we are dealing with a cruel tyrant herzog said but 
the picture as of now is not of a man trying to widen his field of 
combat 
he added i am not saying the iraqi army in these conditions 
is a paper tiger but it is certainly not the mighty monster 
described by so many in the media 
defense minister moshe arens told israel radio we are 
prepared ready and calm 
the military source meanwhile contended today that jordan was 
helping saddam in several ways in addition to the reconnaissance 
flights 
the source claimed that jordan is importing food and medicine 
then passing it on to iraq to help subvert the western embargo 
they can import for themselves and then send these goods to 
iraq and this is what they are doing he said 
in answer to a question he said there was no evidence jordan 
was sending military equipment to iraq

there is no evidence that radiation 
emissions during the 1979 nuclear accident at three mile island 
affected the health of area residents an independent study 
released today concludes 
the study by columbia university scientists said there was no 
sign that the radiation caused leukemia or childhood cancers among 
people living within 10 miles of the plant those illnesses are 
more sensitive to lowlevel radiation than other diseases and are 
the first to appear after exposure the scientists said in a 
briefing several miles from the nuclear plant near harrisburg 
the findings were published today in the american journal of 
epidemiology they match the conclusions of a 1985 report released 
by the state health department that found no evidence of increased 
cancers in a 20mile radius 
in the latest study columbia epidemiologists mervyn susser and 
maureen hatch studied the health records of 160000 residents of 69 
areas within the 10mile radius they also compared cancer rates 
between 1975 and 1985 the accident the worst at a us commercial 
nuclear plant happened in 1979 
during the accident which crippled the unit 2 reactor 
radioactive gases were vented into the atmosphere 
the study expands on a report given in june to the american 
society of epidemiologists that report found no association 
between tmi accident emissions and childhood cancers in a 10mile 
radius around the plant 
hatch said the june report was withheld from the public until 
today because of a release embargo set by the scientific journal 
that published the findings 
the study was funded by the three mile island public health 
fund which was established to study issues related to the 
accident the fund was established as part of a 5 million 
settlement of a 1981 classaction lawsuit against the owners of tmi 
in 1986 the funds administrators subpoenaed hospitals for 
health records used in the study 
the report has been complete for a number of months but 
publication was delayed because of revisions by the authors and 
peer review 
the accident at tmi 2 occurred after a combination of human and 
mechanical errors caused protective cooling water to be drained 
from the reactor some of the reactors cache of nuclear fuel 
melted and radiation was released into the environment the 
accident was the worst to happen at a commercial nuclear power 
plant in the united states 
despite the findings of government reports some community 
members continue to assert the accident left a legacy of illness 
that has yet to be officially recognized 
kay pickering a spokeswoman for three mile island alert a 
citizens group said she doubted that a statistical study would go 
far enough to fully disclose health effects possibly linked to the 
accident she said a better approach would be to track a sample of 
residents who lived within a 5mile radius of the plant at the time 
of the accident she said a similar survey was done the summer 
after the accident 
the people in the community are suffering they believe 
they have been affected she said 
the 1985 health department study which was the first of its 
kind after the accident found no pattern of increased cancer cases 
or deaths but it did turn up isolated instances of 
higherthanexpected cancer cases in several communities downwind 
from the plant the study dismissed those cases as statistically 
insignificant 
a 1984 survey conducted doortodoor found cancer deaths up to 
seven times higher than expected in sections of newberry and 
fairview townships near the plant the health department judged 
that invalid because it appeared to focus on streets where cancer 
victims lived 
a 1986 gpu nuclear corp summary of governmentsponsored studies 
said the 8 millirem average radiation exposure for individuals 
within 10 miles of the plant was less than the 10 millirems 
generated by a single chest xray the highest possible exposure 
for someone who stood naked at the plant boundary throughout the 
accident would have been less than 100 millirems said the review 
by gpu the plants operator

the persian gulf crisis is occurring in a 
region that has become the worlds leading destination for 
increasingly sophisticated weaponry from tanks to fighter planes 
and smart missiles 
the arms that flowed into the areas two leading buyers iraq 
and saudi arabia during the last 15 years are now aimed across 
their common border in a dispute that in some ways echoes the 
nowdiffused cold war 
both we and the soviets thought we were creating allies 
forging relationships on our team in the global bipolar power 
struggle said michael t klare a professor of peace and world 
security studies at hampshire college in massachusetts 
but thats not what they thought they were doing said 
klare who wrote a prescient article in may about the emergence of 
regional superpowers like iraq at no point did any of these 
countries think they were playing on either team they have their 
own agenda 
saudi arabia and iraq received nearly onethird of more than 
300 billion in arms sold to third world countries from 1982 
through 1989 according to a congressional research service 
analysis of us intelligence data 
the united states and the soviet union accounted for more than 
60 percent of that total weapons trade 
the soldiers of iraqi president saddam hussein carry soviet 
assault weapons and fight with tanks and artillery from moscow and 
beijing the fighter planes overhead may come from france or the 
soviet union their multiplelaunch rocket systems and some 
surfacetosurface missiles are made in brazil still other arms 
come from czechoslovakia egypt and south africa 
across the border the saudis have f15 fighters tanks 
antitank missiles and airtoair missiles from the united states 
the british sold the saudis fighters as well the french provided 
antiaircraft batteries 
and president bush has agreed to sell the saudis another 23 
billion worth of weapons more f14s and tanks as well as stinger 
antiaircraft missiles and depleteduranium antiarmor rounds that 
had been banned from riyadhs shopping list 
while the superpowers have used arms as a foreign policy tool to 
reward allies the rest of the world has engaged in the trade for 
purely commercial reasons 
hoping to rid themselves of dependence on the superpowers third 
world countries have been developing indigenous weapons industries 
defense analysts say while they once were limited to making small 
arms and ammunition that is no longer the case 
brazil can build its own tanks and fighter planes and is eager 
to market them india builds large warships artillery and 
missiles countries from argentina to south korea china and south 
africa also have homegrown weapons capability 
in 197879 the united states and the soviet union conducted 
talks aimed at clamping controls on the spread of new conventional 
weapons technology but the discussions broke off after the soviet 
invasion of afghanistan 
it would be far more difficult for such an effort to be 
effective in todays wideopen weapons mart 
in iraq saddams domestic weapons industry is among the biggest 
worries for us military strategists using mercenary western 
expertise he has been able to improve the range of sovietprovided 
scudb missiles and may have developed chemical warheads for them 
saddam also is believed to be well along in developing nuclear 
weapons 
its a tribute to what you can do with money said janne 
nolan a fellow at the brookings institution a washington research 
group 
while the united states did not directly arm iraq it bears 
major responsibility for saddams military strength said stephanie 
neuman of columbia university 
we were encouraging it she said by providing iraq with 
intelligence information during its eightyear war with iran and 
looking the other way while the soviets and europeans armed saddam 
klare said iraq also was quietly permitted to buy us computers 
and other hightechnology items with defense uses in part with the 
aim of luring the country out of the soviet orbit 
driving the united states was a fear that irans islamic 
fundamentalism would grow to dominate the region and lingering 
hatred from the 1970s hostage crisis 
it wasnt a mistake at the time we had to do it neuman 
said 
but each us response to a crisis seems to help sow the seeds 
of the next crisis where weapons are concerned analysts said not 
only by selling arms but also through the lingering superpower 
lesson that building an arsenal is the way to acquire world 
influence 
were going to have more iraqs down the road klare said 
it may be brazil it may be taiwan it may be indonesia were 
contributing to the emergence of these regional superpowers

hostilities officials said today 
north korean prime minister yon hyong muk and about 90 others 
are scheduled to cross the heavily fortified border on tuesday for 
two days of talks with south korean officials the information 
ministry said 
yon is also scheduled to visit with south korean president roh 
taewoo according to government officials who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
it will be the highestlevel contact between the communist north 
and capitalist south since the korean peninsula was divided in 
1945 and security was expected to be tight for the talks to be 
held on wednesday and thursday 
about 3000 police will ring the hotel where south korean prime 
minister kang younghoon and his north korean counterpart will 
meet the ministry said 
thousands more police will be posted around government buildings 
and along routes where the delegations are expected to travel 
police said 
it was agreed that a second round of talks will be held in the 
north korean capital pyongyang on oct 1619 the ministry said 
travel plans and other details were completed late thursday 
between officials of the two koreas meeting in panmunjom a border 
village inside the demilitarized zone that separates the two 
nations 
the north korean delegation consisting of eight delegates 33 
assistants and 50 reporters will walk over the border into the 
south at panmunjom and will be driven the 35 miles to the south 
korean capital 
the communist delegation is scheduled to leave south korea on 
sept 7 
although south korean officials attach great significance to the 
talks observers doubt substantial progress will be made because 
the prime ministers of both nations are mostly figureheads without 
policymaking roles 
north korea has said the talks should cover mainly ways to ease 
political and military tensions south korean officials insist 
priority be given to nonpolitical exchanges to promote mutual 
confidence 
north korea has proposed drastic arms reductions cutting the 
troop level to 100000 each north korea has more than 1 million 
troops while south korea has 650000 
the north koreans also demand withdrawal of the 43000 us 
troops stationed in south korea under a mutual defense treaty but 
south korea opposes any drastic measures such as arms cuts before 
an extended period of confidencebuilding 
in an unprecedented move south korea proposed an unrestricted 
fiveday border opening in midaugust for the 62 million residents 
of the two koreas but north korea failed to meet seoul officials to 
discuss the matter 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
capitalist south in 1945 the nations fought a threeyear war in 
the early 1950s their border is sealed and direct communication 
between their peoples is forbidden

the united states has given up any us 
diplomatic efforts to settle the conflict with iraq and is planning 
massive air attacks if economic sanctions fail a newspaper 
reported today 
the administration must now wait to see whether the sanctions 
and the diplomatic initiatives work but obviously there are other 
options newsday quoted an senior administration official as 
saying the official was not named 
if the sanctions and diplomacy dont work the us does not 
intend to let things stand said a source identified as having 
intimate knowledge of us military thinking in eight to 10 
weeks if hussein doesnt show a serious willingness to withdraw 
from kuwait the administration is prepared to make a decision to 
use the military to increase the pressure on him to get out 
the newspaper said government officials and other knowledgeable 
sources believe the timetable for the start of an attack was four 
to 10 weeks depending on military and political factors 
administration officials told the newspaper that usled 
military action also depends on allowing enough time to pass for 
world onlookers to conclude that economic sanctions imposed against 
iraq were given enough time to take hold the same is said of peace 
initiatives sought by un secretary general javier perez de 
cuellar and arab leaders including jordans king hussein 
newsday says administration officials apparently believe iraqi 
president saddam hussein is not serious about an offer to withdraw 
his troops from kuwait in exchange for a lifting of economic 
sanctions and other concessions to date the united states has 
rejected any compromise insisting on complete withdrawal

in a major turnabout 
president fw de klerk called today for the whitesonly ruling 
national party to be opened to all races in the drive to end 
apartheid 
de klerk said the national party must open its ranks to all 
south africans who shared its basic values and hopes for a 
multiracial democracy he said the party had to prepare for major 
changes confronting the country 
the new south africa demands that those who belong together 
through inner conviction should come together he told a party 
provincial congress in durban 
the opening of the national party to all races would be a 
historic change for the party that created apartheid and attempted 
to exclude nonwhites from political power the party has for 
decades been the main voice of afrikaner nationalism representing 
whites of mostly dutch descent who dominate south african politics 
the president who also heads the party asked the congress to 
give party leaders the authority to amend its constitution to admit 
all races the congress was expected to approve clearing the way 
for similar action at other provincial party congresses 
de klerk said south africans of all colors who want a 
freemarket economy guaranteed human rights and other protections 
must band together to work for their common goals 
the requirement of no racial domination means that power has 
to be shared in such a way that a majority will neither have 
absolute power nor be able to abuse its power to the detriment of 
minorities or for their suppression he said 
de klerk has pledged to end apartheid and share power with the 
black majority but he wants guarantees on rights for the white 
minority under any future blackmajority government 
the government is looking for allies among black political 
groups to buttress its position in negotiations with the african 
national congress on sharing power 
also today the government declined to confirm reports that 
scores of political prisoners would be released saturday the 
government and the anc agreed aug 6 on a review process to free 
political detainees starting from sept 1 
in a speech earlier today to the congress law and order 
minister adriaan vlok warned that black factional fighting which 
has claimed more than 500 lives could resume at any time and push 
south africa into a spiral of violence and bloodshed 
vlok who heads the police also warned that rising crime could 
trigger violence between whites and blacks he said police were 
doing all they could to prevent violence 
factional fighting in black townships around johannesburg has 
left at least 518 people dead and vlok said tension was being 
stoked by strikes black consumer boycotts and terrorist attacks 
these tendencies are unacceptable in a new south africa 
south africans will just have to exercise more tolerance towards 
one another vlok told a provinicial congress of the governing 
national party in durban 
police said today the johannesburg townships were quiet 
the violence began aug 12 between xhosas linked to the african 
national congress and zulus tied to the conservative inkatha 
movement fighting raged in the townships for more than two weeks 
with rival groups battling with axes spears guns and knives 
the government last week imposed emergency restrictions on the 
townships and sent in troops to aid police 
the anc the largest black opposition group church leaders and 
others have accused police of bias during the fighting vlok 
challenged the anc and other groups to present evidence to support 
the claims he said if police officers were implicated in fighting 
they would be punished 
meanwhile about 500 university students marched today to police 
headquaters in cape town to protest the recent johannesburg 
fighting police made no effort to block the students who 
presented a statement to police commanders charging that police had 
sided with inkatha 
police fired shotguns and tear gas thursday and wednesday to 
break up protests at the university of the western cape in cape 
town when students demonstrated against the violence in 
johannesburg

the commander of us forces in the 
middle east said today there will be no war unless iraq starts one 
a move he said would be an awfully stupid mistake 
army gen h norman schwarzkopf in his first news conference 
since moving his command post to saudi arabia repeatedly ducked 
questions about specific us military options under consideration 
but he said the united states was not looking to start hostilities 
theres not going to be any war unless the iraqis attack 
schwarzkopf told reporters after spending the day visiting american 
troops in northeast saudi arabia 
schwarzkopf called the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait not 
only a mugging but a rape he said said iraqi forces in iraq and 
kuwait appeared to be in defensive posture but were capable of 
taking the offense 
they certainly have the capability to attack although i think 
if they were to do so it would be an awful stupid mistake 
schwarzkopf said 
the general glanced at the floor before answering a question 
about how much impact iraqs holding of american and other western 
hostages had on his military planning 
i would tell you that obviously i am just as concerned as 
anyone else about every single human life schwarzkopf said but 
he added what i have to do is plan the military component and 
not concern myself with the hostages 
he refused to answer a question about whether his early 
declaration about war prospects meant that the united states would 
not make an offensive push to drive iraqi forces from kuwait 
he also refused to say whether the military was aiding the 
kuwaiti resistance there have been reports that army special 
operations forces are helping the resistance movement 
there has been speculation that the united states would seek a 
permanent military foothold in saudi arabia regardless of the 
outcome of the current staandoff a delicate subject because of 
antiamerican sentiment in parts of the arab world 
when asked about such prospects schwarzkopf said we have no 
intention of establishing a permanent base in saudi arabia 
schwarzkopf laughed when asked who was in charge of the 
multinational forces 
this is not nato he said this is not a single command 
and there doesnt need to be 
the united states has by far the biggest military presence in 
saudi arabia and many nations that have committed forces to the 
region have not yet sent them or sent only small contingents 
asked by a french reporter if france should send more forces 
scwarzkopf said only i would like all the help i can get 
schwarzkopf is a bear of a man and can be gruff at times but he 
was grandfatherly during stops at several us staging areas 
filling the troops in on the latest developments in the crisis and 
promising them more newspapers and radios 
after a briefing by commanders of the 101st airborne divisions 
air assault brigade schwarzkopf walked into a garage area and 
immediately encountered staff sgt john frady of sylva nc a 
member of a maintenance platoon who was in the process of receiving 
a haircut 
the general asked him ready to do the job 
frady answered ready to go to war sir 
he next visited the 354th tactical fighter wing from myrtle 
beach sc telling them the arrival of the wings a10 
tankkillers had made him more confident of the deterrent power of 
the us deployment 
he said the united states was there to defend saudi arabia but 
ready to fight back if saddam hussein ordered iraqi forces to 
invade the kingdom 
lets face it if he dares come across that border and comes 
down here im completely confident that were going to kick his 
butt when he gets here schwarzkopf said 
speaking to a group of officers in an airconditioned tent at 
the same airstrip schwarzkopf said 
every now and then people have to go to war and ask themselves 
whether they are on the right side or the wrong side there is no 
doubt that we are on the right side now because the whole world is 
telling us that 
his next and last stop was a marine support camp in northeast 
saudi arabia where schwarzkopf received yet another briefing and 
visited with marines digging a sandbaglined foxhole 
our attitude has to be to be in this for the long haul 
schwarzkopf told a small group of marines who had asked him about 
the latest developments in the crisis 
one marine said he had heard a rumor about the c5 crash in 
germany this week 
schwarzkopf told the group the transport indeed had crashed 
killing 13 people as the marines shook their heads schwarzkopf 
said thats 13 more counts against saddam hussein

government and mohawk work crews today 
further dismantled a series of barricades around a heavily traveled 
bridge but other indian roadblocks nearby remained intact 
the destruction of the five barrier sites near the mercier 
bridge and kahnawake reservation resumed despite a breakdown of 
talks between provincial officials and mohawks concerning the 
sevenweek standoff 
the bridge a principal link between montreal and suburbs was 
blocked by mohawks at the reservation in sympathy with the indians 
in oka who objected to a proposed golf course expansion on land 
they consider ancestral 
the conflict began july 11 when the quebec provincial police 
stormed a mohawk barricade in oka about 18 miles west of montreal 
the police were repulsed and one officer was killed but it is 
still not clear who shot him 
canadian forces capt richard stlouis said today that work 
crews had not yet reached the mercier bridge 
we dont have any timetable to get on the bridge we are 
moving day by day he said 
premier robert bourassa issued a terse statement late thursday 
saying he was going back to the original plan of using the army to 
dismantle barricades 
the government of quebec maintains its position concerning the 
intervention of the army announced last monday bourassa said 
he said he was withdrawing from talks because negotiators for 
the six nations iroquois confederacy had announced they were 
pulling out 
lastditch talks between mohawks and government officials this 
week included delegates from the confederacy the highestranking 
traditional leadership of the iroquois which includes the mohawks 
dismantling barricades is our mandate we are to act on our 
own as we see fit our mandate has no limit said an army 
spokesman capt yvon desjardins 
mohawk chief joe norton alleged harassment and said 
shipments of food and medicine were being blocked from entering the 
kahnawake reserve by angry residents and police 
chief billy two rivers said mohawks have been asked to give up 
too much 
maybe some of the white people didnt see indian blood but 
unfortunately we cant give them everything he said 
quebec provincial police and an army spokesmen denied the 
charges of harassment or that food into the reservation was blocked 
i can categorically state that no food is being kept out of 
kahnawake whatsoever said army capt donald roy 
the dispute has touched off an antiindian backlash among 
residents angered by the barricades 
most of kanesatakes 1500 residents have left as a result of 
the confrontation an estimated 200 to 300 remain

un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar and iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz met privately today 
but reported no immediate progress in defusing the explosive 
persian gulf crisis 
they met for two hours at midday then after a short break 
opened a second round of talks attended by their aides 
i met with my friend tariq aziz and we discussed the present 
crisis perez de cuellar told reporters at the end of the first 
session 
aziz who stood next to the secretarygeneral said he was happy 
to meet an old friend and we have confidence in him he said 
they would provide details of their talks after the second round 
the two officials know each other well from meetings during 
negotiations for a formal peace treaty at the end of the eightyear 
iraniraq war 
a senior jordanian official who had met with the un chief 
before the talks with aziz began said there was a strong 
possibility that perez de cuellar will travel to baghdad for 
talks on a settlement of the crisis 
no such decision has been made the official said but the un 
chief was prepared to fly to the iraqi capital to meet president 
saddam hussein if the talks with aziz fail to produce any 
significant progress 
aziz declared on arrival at ammans airport that iraq will 
achieve victory despite the international conspiracy against it 
his defiant statement contrasted with the hopeful comments by 
the un chief on his arrival the previous day perez de cuellar 
said he believed iraq is as eager as we all are to find a just 
and lasting solution of the problem 
i cant understand anyone in the world prepared to sacrifice 
human lives perez de cuellar said thursday 
in his arrival statement aziz said our struggle is a 
historic one and we have all undertaken it in honesty and 
manliness victory will be ours and the arab nations god 
willing 
he added said he would discuss all gulf issues with the un 
official and that he was optimistic about the future of the arab 
nation 
aziz also said iraqi authorities will allow all western women 
and children to leave iraq as of saturday 
saddam had announced on tuesday that western women and children 
held hostage in iraq to fend off a potential us attack could 
leave the country but only a few have since been granted the 
necessary exit permits 
when he arrived at amman airport perez de cuellar told 
reporters i am not a merchant to negotiate i came here to 
discuss ways and means of finding a solution to the problem 
he reiterated earlier statements that he was not in a position 
to make concessions on the requirement that iraq implementat 
resolutions approved by the security council after the aug 2 
invasion of kuwait these are not my resolutionsi cannot make 
any concessions on these he said 
the resolutions demand that iraq unconditionally withdraw from 
kuwait and restore the deposed royal family 
he welcomed as a good step saddams decision tuesday to 
allow foreign women and children among those held hostage in iraq 
to leave 
saddams troops invaded kuwait in a dispute over oil land and 
money then annexed the fallen kingdom the invasion and the 
movement of iraqi troops close to the saudi arabian border prompted 
the creation of a usled multinational force to protect the 
kingdom against further iraqi expansion

german leaders met in a palace of german 
princes today and signed a treaty meant to reconcile the stark 
differences between their two nations just 33 days before they 
become one 
the document was signed by west german interior minister 
wolfgang schaeuble and east germanys top unity negotiator 
guenther krause 
earlier the cabinets of west german chancellor helmut kohl and 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere formally approved the 
pact 
the treaty is the final blueprint for the framework of a united 
nation although it leaves many crucial issues to be decided by a 
united german government 
today we are fulfilling one of the last remaining hurdles to 
german unification de maiziere said moments before the pact was 
signed in a 17th century palace in east berlin 
the sweeping accord preserves east germanys liberal abortion 
law calls for a united berlin to be the capital of the new nation 
and guarantees some social programs for jobless east germans 
it gives western investors first claim to east german property 
a major development that economists say is necessary to revive the 
nations shattered economy 
the pact also allows east germany to maintain some control over 
the 6 million files of the former communist secret police a 
potentially explosive compilation of sinister secrets from the 
nations dark past 
overall the treaty reconciles fundamental legal and political 
differences between two nations that followed vastly different 
paths after they were carved from the conquered nazi empire 
the signing ceremony was held in the stately berlin palace the 
home of german crown princes who laid the foundation for the 
prussian empire of the 18th century like germany the palace was 
destroyed during world war ii and then rebuilt 
the signing took place on the eve of 51st anniversary of world 
war ii on sept 1 1939 hitlers forces invaded poland and 
france and england declared the war that eventually split germany 
the german states will become one on oct 3 when east germanys 
parliament invokes a clause that will allow it to accede to the 
larger nation 
germans in both territories will then elect a common government 
on dec 2 
that impending election date has created an enormous campaign 
battle between kohls conservative christian democrats and his main 
rival in the elections the leftleaning social democrats 
key aspects of the treaty particularly the sharp differences 
between east germanys liberal abortion law and west germanys 
tough one were held up by debate that threatened the pacts 
passage 
although such a treaty was not necessary for german unification 
failure to approve it would have meant that west german laws would 
have become automatically the law of a greater german land 
the treaty was considered an important psychological necessity 
for an east german nation that has been buffeted by enormous 
political and economic change in less than a year and which is 
about to lose its sovereignty and its identity 
the treaty is a companion piece to the economic pact that merged 
the currencies and economies of the german states on july 1 when 
east germany formally became a free market after four decades of 
socialism 
east german joblessness since then has skyrocketed as factories 
collapse in the face of western competition 
the document includes an important provision for the 
distribution of east german property 
tens of thousands of west germans who fled what is now east 
germany after the soviet invasion of world war ii have filed claims 
on their former property a prolonged process is planned to 
determine the validity of those claims on an individual basis 
the uncertainty of those many claims and who will be the 
potential owner of much east german property has been blamed for 
inhibiting western investment needed to provide jobs and replace 
the dying sectors of the east german economy 
under a previous agreement west germans are allowed to claim 
property in east germany that was seized from their families by the 
communists or lost when they fled to the west under the treaty 
signed today anyone who buys land in east germany for development 
purposes is protected from claims by previous owners or their 
heirs there will be a system worked out later to compensate people 
who dont get their land back because it is being developed 
commercially or because their claim would displace people living 
there 
the pact also includes a compromise on the volatile abortion 
question east germanys permissive law will remain in effect until 
a new german government passes a law for both nations in 1992 
it also settles at least for now a dispute between the two 
germanys over the disposition of the files compiled by the 
notorious secret police which kept sensitive information about 
millions of people some of them now leaders in the democratic 
government 
east germany and west germany both wanted control of the files 
a gold mine of espionage and terrorist intelligence under the 
compromise the united parliament will make the decision 
in the meantime the files will temporarily remain in what is 
now east germany under the custody of a west german official to be 
chosen by east germany

the typical american familys ability to buy a 
house fell slightly in july and is expected to drop substantially 
in august because of rising mortgage rates linked to the persian 
gulf crisis a real estate trade group said friday 
the national association of realtors said its housing 
affordability index declined from 1029 in june to 1023 last 
month that means a family with a median income of 34358 had 
1023 percent of the income needed to buy a medianpriced existing 
home costing 98400 
the median income was 34250 in june while the median price 
was 97500 
the median means half of the families earn more and half earn 
less or that half of the houses sell for more and half for less 
however realtors president norman d flynn said mortgage rate 
increases resulting from developments in the middle east will cause 
a substantial loss in housing affordability in august 
home buyers in america will get hit by iraqs invasion of 
kuwait he said firsttime buyers will get hit hardest 
unfortunately entrylevel buyers who might have just qualified to 
purchase a home in june or july may now find themselves priced out 
of the market 
although the median price rose 900 in july the index decline 
was offset by a decrease in the interest rate used to calculate the 
index and the 108 gain in median family income 
the rate a composite of fixedrate and adjustablerate 
mortgages edged down from 1016 percent to 1015 percent in july 
the changes resulted in a 6 increase in the monthly mortgage 
payment to 700 
the july median income exceeded the 33579 needed to qualify 
for a medianpriced home a family earning that amount actually 
would qualify to buy a home priced at 100500 using conventional 
financing covering 80 percent of the cost 
under julys affordability conditions a family earning 20000 
would have sufficient income to qualify for a 58500 home using a 
46800 loan a family earning 30000 would qualify for an 87800 
home with an 80 percent loan 
a family earning 40000 would have sufficient income for a 
117000 home and a family with 50000 income would qualify for a 
146300 home

an obscure group of slavicspeakers 
who escaped centuries of repression in their forested homeland have 
earned a special place in the german unification treaty signed 
friday 
the sorbs who number about 100000 and live in east germanys 
spree forest asked for legal protection of their unique culture 
and got it 
the preservation and continuation of sorb culture and of sorb 
traditions will be guaranteed members of the sorb people have the 
freedom to preserve their language in public life states one 
part of the treaty 
the sorbs are native residents of a remote swath of east germany 
stretching 56 miles north of the czechoslovak border centuries ago 
their marshy wooded homeland was called lusatia 
they are colorful in customs and in dress the traditional way 
for sorbs to get to their fields or visit neighboring villages is 
in long thin wooden boats that are pushed with a pole along small 
waterways crisscrossing the spree forest 
many sorbs are farmers but eelfishing is also a customary 
livelihood 
the sorbs withstood german invasions in the sixth eighth 10th 
and 12th centuries ultimately german invaders swallowed up their 
homeland but not their customs until adolf hitler ordered their 
language not be spoken 
east germanys communist rulers generally allowed the sorbs to 
preserve their ways and actually helped the sorb culture thrive by 
virtually sealing off much of east germany from western influences 
now with east germany opened up to the outside world and 
westerners flooding in the sorbs worry their unique traditions 
could be endangered

men to potential military targets and linked the release of some 
western women and children to the return of iraqis stranded outside

foreigners were waiting to leave for london and paris on iraq 
airways he said iraq wanted the same planes used to bring back an 
unspecified number of iraqis stranded in the two capitals by the 
brutal amercican sanctions 
this is a humanitarian request and we hope the two 
governments will reply quickly and positively alhadithi said at 
a news conference 
later alhadithi said meeting the request was not a 
precondition to iraqs allowing foreign women and children to leave 
the country but if it is not met he said they might have to 
leave by land 
britains foreign office said it would have no objection to 
iraqis returning to baghdad aboard the flights

here with british nationals on it and is going back to empty to 
baghdad iraqi nationals want to go on it of course they can go 
a foreign office spokesman said

president bush today lobbied allies 
to help pick up the tab for the persian gulf buildup making phone 
calls to leaders of saudi arabia britain and france sources said 
some allies and congressmen were pressuring the white house to move 
militarily against saddam hussein 
these administration sources said the pressure for a military 
move was building from various quarters which they declined to 
identify beyond describing them as allies and members of congress 
but they said the pressure by no means constituted a consensus 
the sources said bush continued to weigh all options but at 
this point there was no clearcut case to be made for a us attack 
in the absence of a new provocation the sources spoke on condition 
they not be identified 
the administration refused to comment publicly on prospects for 
military action meanwhile the us military presence in the 
waters surrounding iraq and on the ground in saudi arabia grows 
daily 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk dismissed news reports 
suggesting growing pressure for a military strike as uninformed 
speculation 
bush spoke to saudi arabias king fahd british prime minister 
margaret thatcher and french president francois mitterrand in a 
series of morning phone calls presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said in a statement 
all the leaders agreed to stay in close communication 
regarding each others efforts in the persian gulf fitzwater 
said 
the president is seeking international donations to help pay for 
preparations for a possible war in the gulf with a 
burdensharing plan he announced on thursday 
all the leaders emphasized the need for continued cooperative 
efforts to maintain the international communitys steadfast stand 
against the iraqi aggression in kuwait the written white house 
statement said 
the washington times today quoted sources as saying some us 
allies fear that anything less than crushing iraqi military forces 
would leave baghdads conventional chemical and nuclear weapons 
intact and would put saudi arabia and the smaller gulf nations at 
iraqs mercy once us and other foreign troops are withdrawn 
there is no doubt that the saudis and the israelis fear that 
the united states will accept a deal that leaves a wounded rather 
than a defeated tiger in place in baghdad the newspaper said it 
was told by a wellplaced us source 
the times quoted its sources as saying turkey the exiled 
kuwaiti government the united arab emirates qatar bahrain and 
oman were among the nations urging the united states to use force 
to resolve the crisis 
sen patrick leahy said today the united states should not 
depend on other countries to pay for its massive military 
deployment but should consider higher taxes instead 
i dont want to leave any impression in the world that we pay 
for our soldiers and our sailors if we send them into another part 
of the world only through another countrys money the vermont 
democrat said on nbctvs today show this is not a rent 
military its not a mercenary force 
separate house and senate delegations left andrews air force 
base today for fiveday visits to the troubled region both groups 
planned to meet with us troops and their commanders and with 
government leaders in saudi arabia and egypt 
the united states wants to try to raise enough money to cover 
the 1billionpermonth cost of the us military buildup in the 
region an administration official said 
it is important that the considerable burden of the effort be 
shared by those being defended and those who benefit from the free 
flow of oil bush said 
bush announced that he is seeking money for egypt turkey and 
jordan which are suffering severe economic effects from the trade 
embargo with iraq and from a flood of refugees while also 
soliciting contributions for us military costs 
bush also talked by phone with west german chancellor helmut 
kohl egyptian president hosni mubarak united arab emirates 
president sheik zayed bin sultan alnahyan turkish president 
turgut ozal and the kuwaiti emir jaber alahmed alsabah said 
fitzwater 
the calls were intended to coordinate the countries efforts as 
bush prepares to dispatch secretary of state james a baker iii 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and other officials to the 
persian gulf europe and asia they are to work on signing up us 
friends for what bush called an action plan to round up 
financial aid 
brady will leave next week on a trip which will take him to 
london paris seoul south korea and tokyo according to an 
administration source who spoke on condition that he not be named 
the source said that bradys schedule called for him to meet 
with officials from europe to the far east within a fiveday time 
period returning to washington by sept 8 
japan announced thursday that it would contribute 1 billion in 
assistance and some other countries have indicated a willingness 
to make donations 
leahy said the us could pay for its role in the persian gulf 
crisis in one of three ways by adding the cost to the 
everexpanding budget deficit by cutting other programs or by 
paying as you go the method the lawmaker said he preferred 
i dont like to vote for taxes but i think we ought to be 
honest about what were doing he said 
twentytwo countries are involved in the military effort against 
iraq 
about 60000 us combat troops have moved to battle stations in 
the gulf in the past three weeks and their number is expected to 
reach 100000 soon 
bush told reporters n washington that his analysts have a hard 
time determining whether the standoff with saddam hussein over the 
iraqi presidents invasion of kuwait will end up in a shooting war 
its so hard to answer that question because of the 
unpredictable nature of saddam hussein himself bush said at a 
white house news conference

security forces charged opposition 
party marchers friday clubbing the crowd with batons and firing 
tear gas to break up a rally near the residence of president felix 
houphouetboigny 
several hundred demonstrators briefly sought refuge in the 
courtyard of the french embassy climbing its walls to escape 
police french ambassador michel dupuch spoke with authorities who 
permitted him to escort the demonstrators out of the embassy 
grounds without incident 
at least five people suffered minor injuries when the 
demonstration was dispersed witnesses said 
some of the marchers shouted for the resignation of 
houphouetboigny who has ruled this west african nation since 
independence from france in 1960 
defense minister jean konan banny had issued a warning thursday 
that security forces would use all necessary measures to 
prevent the opposition parties from threatening public order 
the rally occurred four days before the scheduled reopening of 
public schools which were closed in midterm in april after 
students and teachers joined demonstrations demanding the 
legalization of opposition parties 
ivory coast once considered the economic showcase of 
subsaharan africa has been experiencing grave economic problems 
the overvaluation of the frenchbacked west african franc has 
made its products too expensive to compete with other countries 
tax rates are among the highest in the world 
attempts to raise taxes even more and cut government pay checks 
earlier this year sparked the worst wave of unrest since 
independence many government workers including police officers 
firefighters soldiers and customs agents went on strike 
houphouetboigny was forced to withdraw some austerity measures 
and grant demands to permit opposition parties to form 
though the parties were legalized they say their efforts to 
hold public meetings have often been blocked by government 
officials 
houphouetboigny also has been criticized for construction of a 
roman catholic basilica in his native town of yamossoukro the 
government says the basilica cost about 133 million and was paid 
for from houphouetboignys personal funds 
pope john paul ii is to consecrate the basilica sept 10

bond was set at 1 million today for a 
university of florida student charged in an assault in another 
county but police insisted they didnt have a prime suspect in the 
slayings of five college students 
police in gainesville today sealed an apartment near the 
university of florida neighbors identified the apartment as that 
of edward lewis humphrey an 18yearold freshman 
humphrey was arrested thursday at the home of his 79yearold 
grandmother in indialantic 180 miles to the southeast he was 
charged with aggravated battery on a person over 65 
brevard circuit judge dean moxley today set bond at 1 million 
sheriffs spokeswoman joan heller wouldnt comment on the high 
bond saying the case was being directed by the florida department 
of law enforcement a state investigation agency 
about 600 law enforcement officials are involved in a hunt for 
the killer who investigators have said is a methodical maniac 
with a sick grudge against petite brunettes with shoulderlength 
hair 
the victims students at either the university of florida or 
santa fe community college were stabbed to death in offcampus 
apartments in three attacks discovered since sunday police said 
three of the four women were mutilated 
alachua county sheriffs lt spencer mann emphasized today that 
at this particular time we continue to have a pool of suspects 
to say that we have a prime suspect or prime two suspects or 
three suspects is very premature 
police lt sadie darnell said today there had been no 
significant developments in the investigation 
humphrey reportedly once lived in the gatorwood apartment 
complex where the latest two victims were found tuesday and he left 
gainesville on wednesday 
investigators interviewed humphrey on thursday brevard 
authorities said today humphrey appears to be a suspect in some 
pretty serious crimes in alachua county said randy moore an 
assistant public defender in brevard county moore did not 
elaborate 
funerals were being held today for four of the victims in their 
hometowns they are christina powell 17 of jacksonville christa 
hoyt 18 of newberry tracy paules 23 of coral gables and 
manuel taboada 23 of miami 
on thursday more that a thousand friends and family members 
gathered at a pompano beach church to mourn miss powells roommate 
18yearold sonja larson 
it is so untimely that one so young made of all the dreams 
she was made of would be taken from us said the rev ken smith 
pastor of the first baptist church 
police were interviewing possible suspects already in custody 
and checking out others who arent including a man sought for a 
gory slashing in ohio earlier this month said darnell 
the miami herald reported today that investigators suspect the 
killer is a white man in his late 20s to early 30s 
the newspaper quoting unidentified sources said the 
preliminary profile drawn up by investigators also concludes that 
the killer may have law enforcement or health care ties such as a 
job as a security guard or hospital orderly who likely frequents 
student hangouts 
the gainesville sun reported today that authorities were eager 
to find a man identified as warren virgil tinch wanted for the 
stabbing death and mutilation of phyllis elam a 52yearold woman 
from middletown ohio 
elams body was found in woods near her home her face stabbed 
so many times she was identifiable only through dental records 
he tinch is a possible suspect where he fits in on the 
hierarchy of suspects i dont know darnell said 
edwin boldt a spokesman for the cincinnati fbi office said any 
connection between tinch and the florida slayings was definitely 
a long shot 
witnesses allegedly spotted tinch 58 of franklin ohio in 
gainesville and nearby ocala about a week before the murders the 
newspaper reported he allegedly stole vehicles from car 
dealerships in the towns on aug 16 and aug 17 
investigators were sent to bartow in central florida where the 
polk county sheriffs department was holding a man arrested for 
burglary who discussed the killings after turning himself in to 
police but spokeswoman lynn breidenbach said he could have learned 
the information from news reports 
authorities also said they interviewed men in polk and hernando 
counties then dismissed both as suspects 
the killings have released a wave of fear in this college town 
exacerbated by published reports that the killer stole flesh from 
some of the mutilated victims and placed a decapitated victims 
head on a shelf police have given few details about the 
mutilations 
a 24hour rumorcontrol hot line at the alachua county crisis 
center has racked up more than 4000 calls since monday 
many students left town early for the labor day weekend but 
university of florida president john lombardi asserted that things 
were returning to normal school officials said the frightened 
departure of some hundreds of students had little impact on the 
student body of 34000 in its opening week of classes 
other state universities said they were getting inquiries about 
transfers

the commander of us forces in the 
persian gulf described the iraqi invasion of kuwait as 
international rape friday and said war can be averted if iraqi 
troops stay out of saudi arabia 
calling iraqi generals a bunch of thugs army gen h norman 
schwarzkopf also said he could not let the fate of hostages in iraq 
affect his strategy 
i am just as concerned as everyone else about the hostages 
but i am planning a military campaign and i cant concern myself 
with the hostages thats the honest answer said the fourstar 
general who arrived in saudi arabia this week to set up military 
headquarters 
iraqi president saddam hussein has kept about 21000 westerners 
including 3000 americans and 4500 britons from leaving the 
country 
the united states and other western governments have accused the 
iraqi leader of using the foreigners as human shields against 
attack 
schwarzkopf a hulking man known to aides as the bear met 
with reporters following a tour of forward troop positions and port 
facilities 
he said the us units were wellequipped and prepared to repel 
any iraqi attack and protect themselves from chemical weapons 
i am confident of our ability to defend right now 
schwarzkopf said nothing is ever 100 percent guaranteed but if 
the iraqis are dumb enough to attack they are going to pay a 
terrible price 
he added if the iraqis use chemical weapons theyll pay for 
it big time 
it was schwarzkopfs first visit to the troops since moving the 
regional military central command headquarters from macdill air 
force base near tampa fla to the saudi capital of riyadh 
the command was established in 1983 to be responsible for us 
military affairs in 19 countries in the middle east southwest asia 
and northeast africa it was based in the united states because no 
nation in the three regions was willing to act as host 
the general reacting sharply to a question about whether us 
troops were being told they were defending oil 
its not just a question of oil he said theres not a 
single service member out there who thinks this not any ive met 
anybody who has any doubt in their mind about what iraq has 
done should get into another line of work 
what you have here is a situation where not only is this a 
mugging but a rape has occurred an international rape of the 
first order 
schwarzkopf admitted he was surprised by iraqs aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait 
we knew their capability but misjudged their intention he 
said

this discovery is unquestionably one of the most important 
archeological finds in alaska in a halfcentury said diters 
wellpreserved artifacts found in the cave include weapons 
household goods and artwork and some toys that were buried with 
children 
the location was not disclosed 
they were real closedmouth about it very careful in order to 
protect it from pot hunters they didnt even radio information 
about the find we didnt know about it until they got back to adak 
in june 
since then archaeologists have been studying the caves 
contents 
the aleut corp the regional native corporation that has rights 
to the remains and artifacts under the alaska native claims 
settlement act authorized their removal to the university of 
connecticut and vassar college for further examination 
all will be returned to alaska when the studies are complete to 
become the property of the aleut corp diters said 
this does not represent the discovery of any new culture he 
said but it gives us a chance to look at a previously 
uninvestigated area that has the full range of its occupation 
materials in a single area not previously disturbed 
most sites in the aleutians and in other areas of the state 
are overlaid by other cultures so theyre fragmentary through 
other disturbance with this weve got a chance to see a more 
tightly focused and cleared cultural picture 
the last previous work in this area was done in the 30s in a 
hasty fashion and without regard for information that can be 
determined in a careful controlled examination diters said 
scientists suspect the area around the cave was a village and 
they hope to expand their investigation next year 
its rare we get the opportunity to excavate the burial and 
village site in same situation diters said 
although not totally preserved the human remains had been 
ceremonially mummified and wrapped for burial in finely woven grass 
mats in accordance with aleut burial rites diters said 
we found bodies of both sexes and all ages from less than 
oneyearold infants to old toothless elders said lucy lewis 
johnson an archaeologist on the faculty of vassar in poughkeepsie 
ny 
this cave has given us a priceless glimpse of a realm of 
culture she said it is unique not just because of the number 
of bodies but also because it has so many well preserved organic 
artifacts 
that includes a finely carved wooden sculpture of a whale or 
fish with a sea otter or small human on its snout and a bird in 
flight at the tip of its jaw

iraq placed new demands on the west today that delayed the 
departure of 237 women and children from baghdad iraq also 
announced that it was sending more foreign men to military targets 
to shield the sites from attack 
the developments came as the un secretarygeneral met with 
iraqs foreign minister in jordan to try to negotiate a solution to 
the persian gulf crisis 
iraqi spokesman naji alhadithi said the 237 foreigners can be 
flown to london and paris on iraq airways if the airline is allowed 
to retrieve an unspecified number of iraqis stranded in the two 
european capitals by the brutal american sanctions 
asked about the fate of the women and children if britain and 
france rejected the request alhadithi replied only we hope 
that the two governments respond quickly and positively to this 
humanitarian request 
later alhadithi said meeting the request was not a 
precondition to iraqs allowing foreign women and children to leave 
the country but if it is not met he said they might have to 
leave by land 
the international trade sanctions the united nations imposed on 
iraq do no place restrictions on iraqis living in other countries 
britain said it would not object to iraqi nationals returning on 
flights that take foreigners to london france said all foreigners 
must be freed from iraq unconditionally and that it would not trade 
french citizens for iraqis 
the white house said president bush spoke to saudi arabias king 
fahd british prime minister margaret thatcher and french president 
francois mitterrand in a series of phone calls today on the crisis 
bush is urging wealthy allies to help foot the 1 
billionamonth cost of deploying us forces in saudi arabia and 
the gulf region 
in moscow president mikhail s gorbachev said today that the 
military buildup in the persian gulf makes the situation 
explosive very dangerous 
we have to act responsibly all of us to prevent a 
largescale conflict gorbachev said 
in other developments six more warships from the united states 
britain and the netherlands entered egypts suez canal en route 
toward the gulf dozens of ships have assembled in the region since 
iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
nineteen italians meanwhile arrived safely in jordan today 
from iraq they are believed to be among the first westerners to go 
free under iraqs offer to release women and children hostages 
about 60000 us combat troops have moved to battle stations 
and their number is expected to hit 100000 soon to face the 
estimated 265000 soldiers of iraqi president saddam hussein who 
are stationed in and around kuwait 
the commander of us forces in the middle east gen h norman 
schwarzkopf said today that us deployment there is ahead of 
schedule though he gave no figures 
he also said there will be no war unless iraq starts one a move 
he said would bring swift retaliation and prove to be an awfully 
stupid mistake 
schwarzkopf in his first news conference since moving his 
command post to saudi arabia repeatedly ducked questions about 
specific us military options under consideration but he said the 
united states was not looking to start hostilities 
theres not going to be any war unless the iraqis attack 
schwarzkopf told reporters after spending the day visiting american 
troops in northeast saudi arabia 
he also said his military plans were made without regard to the 
issue of westeners being held hostage in iraq 
also today an israeli military source said that jordanian 
military planes are flying spy missions along the saudi arabian 
border to supply iraq with information on troop movements 
the jordanian reconnaissance flights are being flown by 
usmade f5 jets and are giving a view of troop movements dozens 
of miles into saudia arabia the source said 
the un chief and iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz met twice 
today at the royal palace in amman jordan no immediate progress 
was reported but the negotiators were expected to issue a 
statement later 
a senior jordanian official who had met with the un chief 
before the talks with aziz began said there was a strong 
possibility that perez de cuellar will travel to baghdad for 
talks 
he said no such decision has been made but the un chief was 
prepared to fly to iraq to meet president saddam hussein if the 
talks with aziz fail to produce any significant progress 
perez de cuellar had said the current talks would be within the 
framework of un resolutions passed after the invasion the 
resolutions demand that iraq withdraw from kuwait and imposed 
economic sanctions on the baghdad government 
aziz declared on arrival at ammans airport that iraq will 
achieve victory despite the international conspiracy against it 
his defiant statement contrasted with hopeful comments by perez 
de cuellar on thursday the un chief said then he believed iraq 
is as eager as we all are to find a just and lasting solution of 
the problem 
also today sources in baghdad said iraq has issued coupon books 
and set up centers to distribute food when national rationing 
begins saturday 
on the 25th day of a un embargo against iraq long lines 
snaked out of bakeries in the iraqi capital residents said 
refugees fleeing iraq earlier this week reported lines outside food 
shops in smaller desert towns 
alhadithi said the 237 foreign women and children include 123 
britons 66 japanese 19 french 14 americans two australians and 
four others of unspecified nationalities 
he also said an unspecified number of women and children from 
other countries that he did not name were in principle free to 
leave immediately 
he said their governments had to make arrangements for their 
departure 
however he said the foreign men still held in iraq are being 
held at potential military targets all over the country 
every place every town that has a vital installation will 
host our guests he said 
in addition to the italian nationals three finnish women left 
iraq for turkey the finnish foreign ministry said today in 
athens a government spokesman said five greek women and children 
were expected to leave iraq on a flight from baghdad and swedens 
foreign ministry said the 50 swedish women and children stranded in 
iraq have received exit permits and may leave baghdad saturday 
britains foreign office said iraq has issued exit visas to 139 
british women and children all now detained at a baghdad hotel to 
leave on an iraqi jet but british officials do not know when the 
iraqi jet will leave 
iraq assembled more than 200 foreign women and children hostages 
at baghdads menia hotel on thursday after promising to release 
them some were held earlier at iraqi military and civilian 
targets used as human shields by saddam to discourage possible 
us attacks 
the foreigners at the hotel were mostly from the united states 
britain france japan and australia 
the baghdad government said this week that foreign women and 
children would be allowed to depart as of wednesday but still 
required exit visas 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said americans 
still awaited the permits adding this emotional roller coaster 
is inhumane and disgraceful 
since today is the moslem sabbath exit visas were not expected 
before saturday 
the un security council has denounced iraq for preventing 
21000 westerners including 3000 americans and 4500 britons 
and other foreigners from leaving

milwaukee county officials trying to reduce 
welfare fraud are considering a unique program that would leave 
recipients with little discretionary cash 
the program would require direct payment of welfare recipients 
housing utility and food bills through vouchers electronic fund 
transfers or governmentappointed third parties 
the plans sponsor said he hoped the program would end abuses of 
aid to families with dependent children in which cash benefits are 
spent wrongly by adults and children are left to suffer 
im not embarking on a course of welfare bashing said 
county supervisor richard d nyklewicz im trying to be a 
responsible representative and ensure the money is used for its 
intended purpose 
but a lawyer for legal action of wisconsin an advocacy group 
said she would also oppose the cashless system 
i think its terrible said shirin cabraal its a real 
patronizing type of attitude toward welfare recipients the whole 
idea that welfare recipients are not capable of handling welfare 
benefits 
if approved by milwaukee county nyklewiczs experiment still 
would need state and federal approval 
the milwaukee county social services committee began its review 
of the proposal this week but delayed a decision until next month 
supervisor elizabeth coggsjones asked for the delay to allow 
the county health and social services department to research 
whether there are viable alternatives that wont take free choice 
away from welfare recipients 
im not a proponent of cashless voucher systems i think its 
not true welfare reform she said true welfare reform is 
educating people and training them to get decent jobs with decent 
wages and benefits 
the federal government already permits the use of welfare 
benefit vouchers to pay vendors like landlords and utility 
companies but only in cases where a recipient has mismanaged funds 
or needs special assistance 
gary ashcraft director of the division of program evaluation 
for the us department of health and human services in washington 
said the milwaukee program would be the nations first to not use 
cash for general welfare in ordinary cases 
jason turner director of the departments office of family 
assistance said he disliked the idea because welfare recipients 
generally should receive the money and make their own decisions 
with it 
gov tommy g thompson who has initiated two state welfare 
experiments said he would support the milwaukee county plan and 
help obtain the necessary state and federal approval 
if we can have this cashless system set up to assist people 
better then from what people tell me its a step in the right 
direction he said 
thompson urged approval in 1987 of wisconsins learnfare 
program which allows the state to cut a welfare familys monthly 
afdc benefits if one or more of its teenagers have been 
consistently absent from school 
the program was suspended in milwaukee this summer by a federal 
judge who said families were being unfairly sanctioned by 
inaccurate attendance records in milwaukee schools 
the thompson administration also has experimented with a program 
called workfare which requires welfare recipients to participate 
in job training or work parttime to keep their benefits 
milwaukee county the states largest with a population of about 
970000 distributes 64 million per month in food stamps and 
166 million in afdc benefits 
one afdc recipient calvin hopson 43 said he believed there 
was too much mismanagement in a way i think vouchers would 
help hopson said

national rationing takes effect saturday 
in iraq and authorities have issued coupon books and set up 
centers to distribute food sources in baghdad said but the iraqi 
capital was already feeling the squeeze 
long lines snaked out of bakeries in baghdad residents said 
refugees fleeing iraq earlier this week reported long queues 
outside food shops in smaller desert towns 
flour rice dried beans grain and powdered milk had 
dissapeared from shops the baghdad sources said and meat vanished 
days ago 
pharmacy shelves were empty of medicines and hospital officials 
spoke of dwindling supplies of antibiotics and anesthesia said 
sources contacted by telephone from nicosia 
iraq has two to four months stock of staple food according to 
us government and trade estimates some experts speculate that if 
the country tightens its belt it could stretch its stocks to 
withstand a sixmonth siege 
trade minister mohammed mehdi saleh earlier this week reassured 
his countrymen via the governmentcontrolled media that iraq had 
enough food to last a long time he did not say how long 
rationing coupons issued in iraq entitle each person to a 
monthly allocation of 13 pounds of flour 33 pounds of rice 22 
pounds of sugar 35 ounces of tea 11 pounds of oil 17 ounces of 
detergent and one bar of soap 
children under a year old receive three tins of powdered milk 
each month but older children receive none fresh fruit and 
vegetables from summer crops remained plentiful sources said 
its also pretty well accepted that iraqis store more basic 
foods than would be expected in other countries and no one has any 
idea what people have at home said andrew bellingham a farm 
trade analyst with world perspectives inc in washington dc 
its a natural tendency to keep extra stock in any situation 
of instability such as iraqis faced during the gulf war and you 
also have had the iraqi government encouraging it he said in a 
telephone interview 
president saddam hussein announced 10 days after the invasion of 
kuwait that the country would have to prepare for austerity since 
then hoarding and profiteering have been punishable by death 
iraqi people have been better fed in recent years than their 
neighbors in turkey syria iran and elsewhere 
us officials estimate that the average iraqi consumes 3300 
calories each day and could cut back without health difficulties to 
the same 25002900 consumed by people in nearby countries 
consumption in iraq is above the top end of the range for a 
healthy diet recommended by us dieticians 
as final preparations were under way to begin rationing iraq on 
friday sought to barter oil for food it offered an undetermined 
amount of crude oil in return for 50000 metric tons of sugar 
officials in manila said 
the offer was under study by the philippines which relied 
heavily on iraq and kuwait for its oil needs 
baghdads offer to barter was evidence of a worsening cash 
shortage stemming from the aug 6 un trade embargo that has cut 
off the export of oil iraqs main source of revenue experts have 
said the oil embargo is a more powerful weapon than the embargo of 
food 
much of the food consumed by iraqs 17 million people 
especially rice and flour was purchased from the united states and 
has not yet been paid for baghdad still owes the united states 
about 2 billion for food delivered before the invasion of kuwait 
last year iraq spent 29 billion importing about 75 percent of 
its food from the united states canada australia turkey sri 
lanka and elsewhere 
decades of central planning the eightyear war with iran and 
the forced relocation of rebellious kurdish peasants in the fertile 
north have decimated iraqi agriculture 
attempts had been under way before the invasion to try to repair 
some of the damage and encourage individual enterprise 
this week agriculture minister abdelwahab mahmoud said the 
government was considering new measures to encourage production of 
more food 
despite the embargo there have been reports of some supplies 
getting through to iraq by air and by truck from jordan 
a senior british military official air chief marshal sir 
patrick hine suggested earlier this week to reporters in dharan 
saudi arabia that the embargo might have to be strengthened by 
blocking the airspace around iraq military experts pointed out it 
would more difficult and dangerous to stop aircraft than ships 
reports filtering out of kuwait city said iraqi troops had 
emptied warehouses near kuwaits port and hauled the contents on 
tractortrailer rigs to baghdad poultry canned goods and frozen 
meat were said to have been taken from the warehouses according to 
the unconfirmed reports

a supreme court justice friday refused to 
block extradition to israel of an american citizen accused of being 
a palestinian terrorist 
justice harry a blackmun denied an emergency request by mahmoud 
elabed ahmad who is charged in israel with participating in a 
machinegun attack on a bus traveling through the occupied west 
bank 
us officials have said they would move promptly to extradite 
him to israel if the courts did not intervene 
ahmad 37 who hasnt been charged with a crime in this country 
has been in jail since his arrest three years ago while lawyers 
argued over whether he could get a fair trial in israel his 
lawyers said he would be tortured by israeli security officers if 
sent there 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in new york city on aug 
10 rejected ahmads argument that the alleged crime was a political 
act not covered by an extradition treaty with israel 
the appeals court said political motivation does not convert 
every crime into a political offense 
ahmad is represented by former us attorney general ramsey 
clark 
ahmad who israeli authorities sometimes refer to as mahmoud 
abed atta is charged with taking part in an april 12 1986 attack 
in which three palestine liberation organization terrorists hurled 
firebombs and then opened fire with machine guns on a bus carrying 
jewish settlers en route to tel aviv 
the bus driver was killed and a passenger was injured 
ahmad left israel after the attack and was arrested by fbi 
agents in 1987 on a flight from venezuela

two congressional delegations left friday for 
the tense middle east signaling that capitol hill plans to assume 
a larger role in us policy dealing with iraqs invasion of kuwait 
were moving from a process in which this was mostly 
presidential to one where there is more congressional 
involvement said rep mickey edwards rokla a member of the 
house gop leadership 
when the house and senate return to regular session beginning 
the week of sept 10 there will be a round of hearings that will 
include reviews of us foreign policy in the middle east military 
deployment and energy policy and the impact of all of them on the 
federal budget 
secretary of state james a baker iii will be among the first to 
testify appearing tuesday before the house foreign affairs 
committee and wednesday before the senate foreign relations 
committee 
the members of our delegation will be making decisions over 
the next several weeks all of which are affected by the crisis 
in the gulf said house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
who was leading the 22member house delegation 
leaving about the same time in a matching blueandwhite air 
force version of the boeing 707 was a 14member senate delegation 
led by foreign relations committee chairman claiborne pell dri 
the separate delegations had similar itineraries briefings by 
us officials in saudi arabia including military commanders and 
visits with us troops in the field at dhahran and air force units 
stationed in bahrain 
on sunday the two groups were to meet in jiddah saudi arabia 
for discussions with kuwaiti and saudi officials on monday both 
groups were scheduled to meet in cairo with egyptian president 
hosni mubarak 
the house delegation is scheduled to return to the united states 
on monday while the senators were to meet with officials in oman 
and the united arab emirates and return tuesday 
we may be there for a long time and the morale of our troops 
is absolutely critical said sen carl levin dmich a member 
of the armed services committee 
referring to alternately raised and lowered hopes for the 
release of hostages by the iraqi president levin added we 
cannot be used as a yoyo by saddam hussein and that means our 
willpower must remain strong 
lawmakers said they were interested in assessing what additional 
troops allies might commit to the military buildup and progress 
toward costsharing by countries that benefit from the continued 
flow of middle east oil 
concern also was voiced about arab solidarity against saddam 
im particularly anxious to learn what the impact of a 
longterm standoff would be to what degree saddam hussein has the 
ability to create dissension within the arab world said sen 
john kerry dmass 
another goal said sen william cohen is to deter a flood of 
members of congress to the region that might distract us forces 
from their primary mission 
it would be very inconvenient for them to have to deal with 
such an influx cohen said this group will share what it learns 
with colleagues on capitol hill and hope to discourage further 
congressional travel he said 
the senate delegation also included jesse helms rnc john 
glenn dohio alan cranston dcalif john heinz rpa david 
durenberger rminn daniel patrick moynihan dny paul

thirteenyearold matthew garvey was taking a 
break from his summer job at the car wash when his leg was sucked 
into a drying machine and severed from his body the company was 
fined 400 
according to a report released friday by the american youth work 
center a youth advocacy group an estimated 200000 children will 
be injured this year on the job 
on labor day we celebrate the efforts of working men and 
women said linda golodner of the national consumers league 
but we also need to focus attention on the young workers of our 
country 
the american youth work center predicts some 40000 cases of 
child labor violations will be reported this year almost double 
the number found in 1989 
deaths and injuries are increasing dramatically and yet are 
spread thinly across the country said aywcs william treanor 
and so all that people have are anecdotal stories everybody can 
think of one gruesome horrible incident that theyre aware of and 
they think that thats some sort of freak occurrence 
quality car wash in laurel md had hired matthew to dry cars 
with cloths though matthew had no work permit and was underage 
matthew said several other children also worked there including an 
8yearold 
matthew received 400 from the company because the dryer had no 
lid covering the fan blades the car wash also was fined 10000 
for child labor law violations but the money went to the state 
the car wash has since gone out of business 
there were no cops on the beat to say to that employer you 
cannot employ these young people said golodner she said it was 
very tempting for employers to violate child labor laws because the 
chances of getting caught are slim and even if they do get caught 
theyll only get a slap on the wrist 
in any way you look at it child labor is cheap labor 
golodner said many dont know theyre being exploited and 
because it may be their first job they want to please their 
employer 
the department of labor conducted a oneday sweep of businesses 
in june this year uncovering 3800 cases of child labor violation 
most of the cases involved youngsters working more hours than the 
laws allow but many were using dangerous machinery 
as a result of the sweep the labor secretary elizabeth dole 
announced that the administration would back legislation to 
increase fines from 1000 to 10000 the maximum penalty for 
violations 
the legislation cosponsored by reps charles schumer dny 
and don pease dohio will go to the floor when congress gets back 
to work this fall 
but treanor said it was likely the bill would be held up by 
other priorities facing congress and added that it wasnt 
farreaching enough to be effective 
one area not covered by proposed legislation is agricultural an 
estimated 300 children are killed every year in farm work and more 
than 23000 are injured in july this year investigators from the 
department of labor found children as young as 3 years old working 
as migrant laborers in northern california 
the national consumers league and aywc are calling on congress 
and the labor department to update the child laws on the books 
since 1938 create stiffer penalties for violations and to step up 
reporting and enforcement efforts 
treanor said businesses themselves should develop and enforce 
standards for working youths if macdonalds started serving green 
cheese or something theyre going to go nuts at macdonalds 
headquarters said treanor why dont these companies go nuts 
when they find out that a 14yearold just sliced her hand off in 
one of their fast food joints

president fw de klerk called 
friday for the governing national party which implemented 
apartheid four decades ago to accept nonwhites as members 
de klerk said the allwhite partys restrictions were at odds 
with its goal of creating a democracy free of domination by any 
race or group 
the new south africa demands that those who belong together 
through inner conviction should come together he told a party 
provincial congress in durban 
the african national congress and other antiapartheid groups 
called de klerks proposal welcome but overdue the leader of the 
rightwing conservative party denounced it 
the government is looking for political allies among black 
political groups to buttress its position in negotiations with the 
anc the main black opposition movement on sharing power 
the anc seeks a oneman onevote system virtually guaranteeing 
a black majority government de klerk wants protection for whites 
and other minority groups a free market economy and guaranteed 
rights such as the right to own property 
the congress and three other upcoming provincial meetings are 
expected to approve accepting nonwhites even with the change 
black party members would not be able to vote for the partys 
candidates in national balloting because apartheid bars them from 
voting in national elections 
better late than never anc spokesman pallo jordan said of 
the proposed change im sure there are some blacks who would 
join but i cant imagine why 
conservative party leader andries treurnicht an opponent of 
power sharing said the national party had committed political 
suicide because he said people want nationalism not integration 
accepting blacks and other races would reverse the national 
partys heritage as the architect of apartheid it won power in 
1948 on a platform of white dominance and has been the main voice 
of afrikaner nationalism representing whites of mostly dutch 
descent who dominate south african politics 
under apartheid the countrys 5 million whites control the 
government and economy while the 30 million blacks have no voice in 
national affairs 
since replacing pw botha as president in 1989 de klerk has 
pushed for repeal of apartheid laws and held talks with the anc 
his efforts have caused more whites to leave the national party 
for the rightwing conservative party and extremist groups 
in his speech de klerk accused treurnicht of advocating 
violence to prevent change in south africa he said the 
conservative party sought continued policies of oppression which 
would bring the country to its knees 
racism and discrimination in south africa is gone forever 
de klerk said 
the national party accepts there will be an inevitable 
realignment in the party political sphere in the new south africa 
it is building he said it also believes the basis for future 
cooperation should be laid now otherwise valuable opportunities 
will be lost 
in an earlier speech to the congress law and order minister 
adriaan vlok said fighting between black factions could resume at 
any time and push south africa into a spiral of violence 
vlok who heads the police also said rising crime could trigger 
violence between whites and blacks he said tension was being 
stoked by strikes black consumer boycotts and terrorist attacks 
fighting erupted aug 12 in black townships near johannesburg 
and raged for almost two weeks zulu followers of the conservative 
inkatha movement fought xhosas and other blacks loyal to the anc 
with axes spears guns and knives 
the two groups oppose south africas apartheid system of racial 
separation but are divided by leadership rivalry tribal loyalty 
and differing visions of a future south africa 
the government last week imposed emergency restrictions and sent 
in troops to aid police in the areas of violence police said 
friday the johannesburg townships were quiet 
about 500 university students marched friday to police 
headquaters in cape town to protest the recent unrest unlike the 
previous two days police made no effort to block the students who 
presented a statement charging police had sided with inkatha 
the anc church leaders and others also have accused police of 
bias during the fighting the government has rejected the 
accusations 
in lusaka zambia anc leader nelson mandela said friday he is 
not ready to meet with inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi to try 
to end the fighting we can not meet a man who wants to see the 
blood of black people that we can not do mandela told reporters 
on his arrival at lusaka airport 
in the past mandela has blamed buthelezi for the violence 
in other developments friday the government confirmed that 15 
prisoners would be released sometime after the weekend the 
government and the anc agreed aug 6 on a review process to free 
political detainees starting sept 1

one day before the anniversary of the war 
that drove them apart the german states signed a sweeping treaty 
friday meant as a final blueprint for bringing them together 
german leaders met in a 17th century palace of german princes to 
sign the document which seeks to reconcile the stark differences 
between two societies that will form one nation oct 3 
the pact will allow east germany to retain its liberal abortion 
law and gives western investors more rights to buy east german 
land a measure economists say is necessary to rescue the nations 
dire economy 
it also calls for berlin to become the capital of a united 
germany guarantees some social programs for jobless east germans 
and recognizes the five states east germany will become in a united 
nation 
the treaty leaves many crucial decisions on uniting the nations 
to the new government that will be elected to lead both nations 
dec 2 
the 900page document was signed by west german interior 
minister wolfgang schaeuble and east germanys top unity 
negotiator guenther krause 
earlier the cabinets of west german chancellor helmut kohl and 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere formally approved the 
pact 
today we are fulfilling one of the last remaining hurdles to 
german unification de maiziere said 
the parliaments of the two nations likely will approve the 
treaty next week 
the signing took place on the eve of the 51st anniversary of 
world war ii on sept 1 1939 hitlers forces invaded poland and 
france and england declared the war that eventually split germany 
the treaty promises that the new united germany will respect the 
borders of its european neighbors 
the pact reconciles some fundamental legal and political 
differences between two nations that followed vastly different 
paths after they were carved from the conquered nazi empire 
schaeuble said the goal of the broad accord was to again 
standardize what had been 45 years of of developing separate 
systems of laws and differing economic and living conditions 
the treaty was the product of intense negotiations between west 
german chancellor helmut kohls conservative christian democrats 
and the leftleaning social democrats who are campaigning to win 
the dec 2 elections 
key aspects of the treaty particularly the differences between 
east germanys liberal abortion law and west germanys strict one 
were held up by intense politicking that threatened the accord 
the treaty itself was not necessary to german unification 
because east germany already has voted to merge with west germany 
but failure to approve it would have meant that west german laws 
would have become the law of both lands without accommodating the 
vastly different society reared on socialism 
although berlin has been designated the capital it is still 
undecided whether it or the current west german capital bonn 
will be the seat of the new government germany also must decide 
what to do with the massive east german bureaucracy still largely 
composed of functionaries from the old regime ousted last autumn 
the treaty is a companion piece to the economic pact that merged 
the currencies and economies of the german states on july 1 when 
east germany became a free market after four decades of socialism 
east german joblessness since has skyrocketed as factories 
collapse in the face of western competition 
the document includes an important provision meant to lure more 
western companies into east germany 
tens of thousands of west germans who fled what is now east 
germany after the soviet invasion of world war ii have filed claims 
on their former property 
the uncertainty of who owns what in east germany has been blamed 
for inhibiting western investment needed to provide jobs and 
replace the dying sectors of the east german economy 
the treaty gives western investors who buy east german land 
protection from any claims made by former owners or their heirs 
who would instead be compensated with cash under a system to be 
worked out later 
on the abortion question east germany will be allowed to retain 
its abortionondemand law until at least 1992 deadline for a 
united parliament to write a new law for the entire nation 
the nations also agreed the new parliament will decide what to 
do with the files compiled by the notorious secret police which 
kept sensitive information about millions of people 
in the meantime the files will remain in what is now east 
germany under the custody of a west german official to be chosen by 
east germany 
in a related matter the west german cabinet on friday decided 
to grant amnesty for smalltime east german spies who operated in 
west germany although it exempts those who are found to have taken 
part in murders threats or other nefarious activities

the state department said on friday that an 
autopsy conducted with an american doctor present confirmed that an 
american banker died of a heart attack after being rounded up by 
authorities in iraq 
but the department said the fact that a heart attack killed bank 
executive james l worthington 56 in no way diminishes the 
inhumane treatment which may have contributed to his death 
he was clearly under stress said margaret tutwiler the 
departments press secretary he didnt have access to decent 
medical facilities 
we want to make clear to iraqi officials that we hold them 
responsible for the safety and wellbeing of all americans she 
said

arab foreign ministers ended a twoday 
emergency session friday with a new condemnation of iraqs invasion 
of kuwait and a call for iraq to immediately release foreign 
hostages conference sources said 
only 13 of the leagues 21 members attended the emergency 
meeting and only 10 of them were represented by foreign ministers 
reflecting the deep split that iraqs invasion of kuwait has 
created in the arab world 
egypts foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid said the 
resolutions would be announced at a news conference saturday 
sources close to the conference who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said five resolutions were approved 
they called for the immediate release of all foreign hostages 
held by iraq and for compensation to be paid to kuwait for losses 
resulting from the invasion the sources said 
other resolutions call for all civilians to be welltreated and 
compensated for losses reiterate the leagues condemnation of iraq 
for the invasion aug 2 and call for the return of the rule of 
kuwaits emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah the sources said 
no explanation was given for the delay in announcing the 
resolutions foreign ministry sources insisted it was only to allow 
time for the resolutions to be translated into english and french 
the state minister for cabinet affairs in kuwaits deposed 
government abdelrahman awady expressed satisfaction with the 
resolutions but refused to elaborate 
at an emergency arab summit held in cairo on aug 10 a dozen 
members condemned iraq and agreed to send arab troops to saudi 
arabia so far only egypt syria and morocco have sent contingents 
it was those same 12 states plus libya that accepted egypts 
invitation for the latest emergency meeting 
on thursday the league secretarygeneral chadli klibi told 
reporters the ministers had reviewed reports on efforts by some 
arabs to defuse the crisis klibi emphasized that any plan had to 
include the unconditional withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait 
and the restoration of sheik jaber as ruler 
he was apparently referring to a reported initiative by the 
palestine liberation organization which kuwait has rejected the 
plo plan envisages a federation between kuwait and iraq in which 
the emirate would be the junior partner 
other arab states including libya jordan and sudan are involved 
in diplomatic moves 
a sixnation committee comprised of egypt syria saudi arabia 
bahrain libya and kuwait drafted the resolutions and presented 
them to the ministers friday 
in addition to iraq league members boycotting the meeting 
because of their varying levels of support for president saddam 
hussein were jordan sudan yemen algeria tunisia mauritania

health secretary louis sullivan sent congress 
on friday a preliminary outline of a plan that will change the way 
physicians are paid by the medicare program 
the package includes a preliminary fee schedule covering about 
1400 physician services shifting payments to primary care and 
away from procedurebased services like surgery 
under the new system physician fees will be based on the time 
skill level and resources needed to perform the service as well as 
practice costs and malpractice insurance costs 
more than 500000 physicians will be affected by the change 
scheduled to be impelemented jan 1 1992 it will be the largest 
change in the medicare program since its inception 25 years ago 
in his letter to health committee and subcommittee chairmen and 
ranking members sullivan cautioned that the numbers in the fee 
schedule are very preliminary many and perhaps all of these 
values will change 
important policy and technical questions are unresolved 
he said 
under the current medicare system physicians are paid their 
actual charge customary charge or the prevailing local charge for 
a service whichever is lowest 
the system has resulted in large variations in payments among 
localities and services 
the new system will pay physicians either the actual charge or a 
fee based on the value scale whichever is lower 
a geographic adjustment will account for differences in practice 
costs but overall payments will increase for many physicians in 
rural areas who are paid less than urban physicians under the 
current system 
a spokesman for the american medical association said the 
groups officials were looking over the preliminary fee schedule 
but could not comment in detail on the proposal yet 
the information was to be published in the federal register soon

about 250 white supremacists are 
expected in two northeast georgia cities for marches and 
demonstrations saturday and they may hide their faces thanks to a 
court ruling throwing out a 1951 antimask law 
georgia attorney general michael bowers has advised state law 
enforcement officials not to enforce the law against ku klux klan 
masks and most other concealments in public areas 
the law was overturned in may by a judge in gwinnett county an 
appeal to the georgia supreme court is pending 
since the law has been declared unconstitutional and not been 
clarified by the supreme court there is a possibility that 
officers would be open to civil rights actions if they enforce 
it bowers said 
bowers as attorney general advises only state agencies but 
local police in gainesville where saturdays largest demonstration 
is planned said they wont try to stop masked klansmen either 
its going to be our decision to adhere to the attorney 
generals decision said gainesville police capt marion 
darricott 
a year ago about 280 klan members skinheads and other white 
supremacists demonstrated in gainesville officials of the center 
for democratic renewal an atlanta group monitoring klan activity 
expect a similar number this year said center executive director 
daniel levitas 
the demonstration was planned by the invisible empire knights of 
the ku klux klan but literature this week targeting minority 
neighborhoods around gainesville indicated that other klan factions 
and white supremacists also would participate darricott said 
klan members have a permit for a morning march and rally in 
downtown gainesville downtown streets will be cordoned off and 
businesses agreed to close for the morning to avoid the activities 
darricott said 
the enhanced security for this years events tighter than a 
year ago comes because of prior klan activity in this area 
the captain said 
only police and news media representatives will be allowed 
access to the supremacists march and rally spectators and 
counterdemonstrators will be restricted to a designated space near 
the courthouse he said 
the center for democratic renewal is planning two rallies in 
gainesville in opposition to the white supremacist activities a 
morning ecumenical prayer service at a baptist church and a noon 
community unity rally at an apartment complex the locations 
are away from the downtown kkk activities 
after the gainesville march and rally some klan demonstrators 
are expected in lawrenceville about 30 miles away for a 
courthouse rally 
that courthouse is where klansman shade miller was arrested last 
year in his oneman challenge of the states klan mask law 
gwinnett state court judge howard cook declared the law 
unconstitutional in may agreeing with millers contention that the 
law violated klansmens first amendment right to anonymous free 
speech and expression 
klan members also plan an annual crossburning ceremony saturday 
night at stone mountain on the property of longtime klan leader 
james venable according to klan watchers at the center for 
democratic renewal

a womans heirs have prevented the 
rev billy grahams organization from receiving part of her 3 
million estate saying a fundraiser for the tv preacher used undue 
influence to get the elderly woman to change her will 
under the terms of a pretrial settlement approved tuesday by a 
surrogate court in brockville the family will split the estate 
with a charitable foundation set up in the womans name 
jessie latta died in september 1988 at age 93 and left most of 
her estate to the jessie latta foundation of which carl green 63 
was a director 
green was also a fundraiser for the minneapolisbased billy 
graham evangelistic association another 100000 was left to the 
graham association 
green could not be reached for comment friday and the 
minneapolis office of grahams association was closed friday 
afternoon 
lattas greatnieces and nephews did not know latta had changed 
her will until she had died her previous wills left the estate to 
the family 
the family claimed green of ontario worked his way into 
lattas life and become a close confidant 
it was so obvious there was some kind of influence said 
dianne hickling one of the four family members who contested the 
will 
lawyers for the family produced greens weekly reports on his 
visits to latta beginning in late 1976 they outline lattas 
growing dependence on green and his certainty latta would leave a 
lot of money to the association 
handwritten comments by greens superiors in the margin of his 
reports praise his progress saying stay close to her and 
very good prospect 
at one point green described his visits to latta as a 
cultivating job as latta grew increasingly infirm she began 
to watch religious television shows including grahams crusades 
greens visits became more frequent 
tuesdays settlement split the 3 million estate equally between 
six family members and the latta foundation hickling has replaced 
green as a foundation director 
the family is considering going to court to retrieve about 
750000 latta gave the association

the resolution trust corp plans to hire a 
special group of employees to watch for possible corruption as it 
sells hundreds of failed savings and loans an agency spokeswoman 
said friday 
the rtc hopes to set up a team of 20 to 30 contractor cops 
this fall spokeswoman kate spears said the team which will 
oversee the sale of billions of dollars of sampl assets will be led 
by a new assistant director of the rtc to be named in the near 
future 
were going to be hiring people to work nationwide ms 
spears said 
regulators are haunted by the specter of sampl fraud since abuse 
by some thrift operators was partly responsible for the collapse of 
hundreds of institutions in recent years it will cost us 
taxpayers an estimated 500 billion to pay for the bailout of the 
federally insured thrifts 
in june after weeks of criticism by democrats president bush 
announced with great fanfare that he was doubling government 
spending on investigating and prosecuting sampl fraud bush 
established rapid response teams of investigative lawyers and 
accountants to be directed by a justice department official 
we need to put those people in jail and call them to account 
for their conduct the official james g richmond told the 
associated press in a recent interview richmond formerly the us 
attorney for northern indiana was appointed to the new position of 
special counsel for financial institution fraud 
in addition to fraud by sampl insiders regulators also are 
sensitive about allegations of abuse stemming from their own 
efforts to clean up the mess democrats in congress have accused 
the regulators of making sweetheart deals with outside buyers of 
failed thrifts 
in a highly publicized case congress has been investigating 
investor james fail for his purchase of 15 insolvent texas sampls 
now known as bluebonnet savings bank with 70 million in borrowed 
money and only 1000 in personal funds 
to help prevent future abuses the rtcs new contractor cops 
will coordinate their efforts with the agencys inspector general 
john adair ms spears said 
it looks to us like the opportunities for fraud are going to 
be enormous adair told the washington post he was not 
immediately available for comment friday rtc spokesmen said 
the new rtc team will keep an eye on the various contractors 
hired by the agency to sell thrift assets and manage them until 
they are sold the new watchdogs will watch for kickbacks rigged 
bids and other forms of fraud involving the assets repossessed by 
failed sampls which range from office buildings hotels and 
condominium developments to car washes and golf courses 
since the sampl bailout bill became law a year ago the rtc has 
taken over 475 ailing institutions 
the office of thrift supervision an agency of the treasury 
department said thursday that at least 246 additional sampls are 
expected to fail and are likely candidates to be taken over by the 
rtc

an 18yearold university of florida 
freshman charged with beating his grandmother was held on 1 
million bond friday and police investigating the deaths of five 
students sealed his apartment 
task force investigators refused to say whether he is considered 
to be among the potential suspects in the slayings 
at this particular time we continue to have a pool of 
suspects said alachua county sheriffs lt spencer mann to 
say that we have a prime suspect or prime two suspects or three 
suspects is very premature 
edward lewis humphrey was arrested thursday at his grandmothers 
house in indialantic some 180 miles to the southeast and charged 
with aggravated battery on a person over age 65 authorities said 
two florida department of law enforcement agents spent 12 hours 
thursday at the jail in sharpes where humphrey was held and 
brevard circuit judge dean moxley increased humphreys bond from 
10250 to 1 million about an hour before the agents left early 
friday the agents returned to the jail friday 
brevard county sheriffs spokeswoman joan heller said humphreys 
first court appearance initially scheduled for early friday 
afternoon was delayed for security reasons 
hes a singlecell prisoner meaning that hes considered 
violent she said 
about 600 law enforcement officials are involved in a hunt for 
the killer who investigators have called a methodical maniac 
with a sick grudge against petite brunettes with shoulderlength 
hair 
authorities have said they are interested in an ohio fugitive 
wanted in a mutilation slaying there mann said police also were 
looking for a man wearing camouflage pants who ran away when a 
state trooper tried to question him in gainesville early friday 
investigators are interviewing or watching three or four other 
potential suspects in central florida police said 
the victims students at either the university of florida or 
santa fe community college in gainesville were stabbed to death 
in offcampus apartments in three attacks discovered since sunday 
police said three of the four women were mutilated 
gainesville police sealed off humphreys apartment thursday and 
questioned anyone attempting to enter the property about three 
miles west of campus 
we have investigators interested in that location we have 
task force members who are interested in the area said lt sadie 
darnell a police spokeswoman but she refused to say whether any 
search warrants had been sought 
police at the scene wouldnt talk about what they were doing 
there but a parttime maintenance man at the complex said 
authorities had not entered humphreys apartment no 131 
theyre just watching it to make sure nobody goes in and takes 
anything out said joe lotz the maintenance man and a university 
of florida senior 
at humphreys apartment complex friday six detectives wearing 
rubber gloves and green smocks combed through six garbage bins and 
removed some undisclosed items 
in this kind of investigation its important not to overlook 
any possible kind of trace evidence police investigator gary 
manning said 
humphrey had been under surveillance since tuesday when the 
latest two victims were found at the gatorwood apartment complex 
he lived in gainesville over the summer but was evicted from 
gatorwood the orlando sentinel reported 
a florida department of law enforcement plane followed humphrey 
as he drove wednesday from gainesville to his grandmothers home 
neighbors said he had experienced emotional problems since 
suffering a severe head injury in a traffic accident more than a 
year ago 
funeral services were held friday for four slaying victims in 
their hometowns christina powell 17 of jacksonville christa 
hoyt 18 of newberry tracy paules and manuel taboada both 23 and 
of suburban miami 
the killings unleashed a wave of fear in this college town 
exacerbated by published reports that the killer stole flesh from 
some of the mutilated victims and placed a decapitated victims 
head on a shelf police have given few details about the 
mutilations 
hundreds of students fled the school earlier in the week and 
others skipped class to extend their labor day weekend 
larry humes a university spokesman said i think a lot of 
people headed for the beach its probably a desire for suds and 
surf as much as it is fear

the fight to keep abortion legal on guam is 
being overshadowed in saturdays primary elections by the 
possibility that the us territory may have its first woman and 
nonnative governor 
gov joseph ada is unopposed on the republican ballot as he 
seeks a second term 
democrats face a choice between sen madeleine z bordallo a 
native of minnesota and widow of guams former governor or former 
lt gov rudy sablan the winner will face ada on nov 6 
guams 21member unicameral legislature unanimously approved a 
bill virtually banning abortions march 8 after archbishop anthony 
apuron threatened in a television interview to excommunicate any 
roman catholic senator who voted against it 
ada signed the bill into law saying in my heart i believe 
that a fetus is a human being 
the law carried a penalty of up to a year in jail and a 1000 
fine for obtaining an illegal abortion or soliciting a woman to 
have an abortion performing an illegal abortion was punishable by 
up to five years in prison 
last week us district judge alex munson struck down the law 
as unconstitutional munson declared that roe vs wade the 1973 
supreme court decision establishing the right to an abortion 
applied with equal force and effect to guam 
ada has not indicated whether he will seek an appeal 
mrs bordallo has said she also opposes abortion 
ada said hes running on his record of the past four years he 
said he is confident he and his running mate lt gov frank blas 
will win reelection 
on jan 31 mrs bordallos husband ricardo chained himself to 
a statue wrapped himself in guams flag and shot himself in the 
head that occurred less than four hours before he was to fly to 
los angeles to begin serving a fouryear prison term for witness 
tampering and obstruction 
ada defeated bordallo in the 1986 election after bordallo had 
been indicted on the federal charges 
mrs bordallo wants to be guams first woman governor and the 
first governor who is nonchamorro the name for native guamanians 
women are moving ahead today they are leading countries 
right next door we have a housewife leading 60 million people 
said mrs bordallo referring to philippine president corazon 
aquino 
some 130000 people life on guam an island about 1500 miles 
east of the philippines 
mrs bordallo 57 came to guam in 1948 when her father accepted 
a position as principal of george washington high school here 
sablan 58 served as gov bordallos lieutenant governor from 
1974 to 1978 unsuccessfully challenged bordallo in the democratic 
primaries in 1978 and 1982 
sablan who also opposes abortion said one of his priorities as 
governor would be to set up a territorial tax structure that is not 
tied to the federal tax system 
the archbishop issued a pastoral letter published in newspapers 
this week calling for voters to vote down prochoice candidates 
like a modern day pontius pilate a legislator or official may 
attempt to wash his or her hands of abortion apuron said 
however the legislator cannot wash away the blood of the 
innocents he or she has consciously declined to protect nor can 
the voter sit idly by in apathy

a university of connecticut student 
whose mother turned him into police was sentenced friday to five 
years in prison for drug dealing despite her tearful pleas for 
leniency 
he wants to deal with his problem jean terrazzano of 
madison said of her 21yearold son stephen m russo he 
realizes he could be dead now please give him a chance to get 
treatment 
superior court judge richard damiani said russo gave up his 
chance to avoid prison when he was arrested while the original 
charges were pending 
thats why you are going to prison today because you are a 
drug seller damiani said it makes no difference whether 
youre from a suburb or a city ghetto youre a drug seller 
russo who was to begin senior year next week was sentenced to 
10 years in prison suspended after five years and three years 
probation 
cleancut and wearing a blue suit russo looked more like the 
law student he wanted to be than the drug dealer damiani said he 
was 
all i can said is im sorry for all the pain and suffering i 
inflicted on my family and other kids russo said weeping but 
i cant turn back time im sorry for what ive done 
terrazzano called police to her home on june 26 1989 and 
officers found russo with 27 grams of heroin and 7 pounds of 
marijuana court records show they later found 85000 in his 
safety deposit box 
in march new haven police arrested russo after finding him with 
broken fingers an injured ankle a cut scalp and 65 packets of 
heroin 
russos lawyer hugh f keefe said russo continued to sell 
drugs because new york drug dealers were threatening his life over 
money he owed them 
russo accepted a plea bargain in july to all charges pending 
against him pleading guilty to two counts of possession of heroin 
and one count of possession of marijuana with intent to sell 
terrazzano had said she hoped her son would receive treatment 
not a prison term she blamed herself for russos problems his 
father died when russo was only a year old and she immersed herself 
in her legal career 
damiani said russos difficult childhood could have contributed 
to his becoming an addict but i dont think your mother can be 
blamed for your becoming a drug dealer damiani said thats 
greed 
damiani said russo had a choice to make in prison 
you can say my mother put me here and the judge is a bum 
damiani said or you can be strong and be a man and reflect on 
what youve done and come out of prison a productive person 
as her son was led out of the courtroom terrazzano sat in the 
courtroom sobbing as she leaned on the bench in front of her her 
husband joseph terrazzano tried to comfort her 
outside court she said that given the same circumstances she 
would call the police again what other choice did i have she 
said im just thankful hes still alive

an increasingly frustrated nasa will 
try again to launch columbia on wednesday if a broken electronic 
part used for one of the telescopes aboard the shuttle can be 
repaired easily 
workers entered the shuttle cargo bay friday to try to find 
whats wrong with an electronic box at the base of an xray 
telescope one of four in the missions 150 million astro 
observatory 
the space agency late thursday called off a scheduled saturday 
launch after spending the day fruitlessly trying to communicate 
with the telescope inside the shuttles cargo bay the broken part 
is believed to have caused the loss of contact 
it was the second time the columbia countdown had been halted 
the first launch attempt in late may was scrubbed because of a 
hydrogen fuel leak 
the last space shuttle mission was in april the current lapse 
is the longest between shuttle flights since the hiatus following 
the 1986 challenger disaster 
any time we get close and dont go like a kid going to the 
carnival were frustrated and were anxious to get going said 
william lenoir head of nasas space flight program but were 
not going until were ready i think were getting awfully close to 
ready 
the latest problem appears to involve a line driver a component 
of the electronic box which routes electrical power and telemetry 
between the orbiter and the xray telescope said lennard fisk 
nasas chief scientist if that is the case a cable can be easily 
installed to a second line driver in the unit he said 
the launch will be delayed until friday or saturday however if 
the entire electronic box has to be replaced fisk said nasa 
expects to know the extent of the problem by saturday afternoon 
columbias seven astronauts plan to remain at kennedy space center 
until then 
were calmly taking our time and when its ready were going 
to go fly lenoir said 
saturdays launch also had been threatened by a problem with a 
middeck instrument that measures acceleration and vibration said 
launch director bob sieck the instrument failed to activate 
properly during the countdown and probably will have to replaced 
four astronomers aboard columbia will operate astros three 
ultraviolet telescopes during the nine to 10day flight the 
observatory will probe some of the hottest objects in the universe 
including a comet and a supernova 
the latest delay is not expected to affect astros observing 
schedule fisk said but it is the latest in a series of 
embarrassments for nasa 
atlantis classified pentagon mission was delayed from july to 
november after the shuttle was found to be leaking hydrogen and 
the entire threeshuttle fleet temporarily was grounded 
in addition to the leaking shuttles the space agency has spent 
the summer contending with the hubble space telescopes flawed 
mirror and the occasional loss of contact with the venusorbiting 
magellan spacecraft 
nasa had hoped to launch nine shuttle flights this year only 
three have gone the last one being discoverys trip in april with 
hubble 
discovery is scheduled to be moved to another launch pad on 
sunday to await an october flight with the sunprobing ulysses 
satellite columbia has until sept 14 to lift off otherwise it 
will be forced to wait until after discoverys flight lenoir said 
nasa must launch discovery between oct 5 and 23 to take 
advantage of the alignment of earth the sun and jupiter whose 
gravitational field will slingshot ulysses back to the sun the 
next opportunity for launch will not be for another 13 months 
as far as the leaks lenoir said the launch team is confident of 
columbias new hydrogen lines 
he also said it now appears atlantis has the same type of leaks 
as columbia engineers initially believed atlantis leaks were in a 
different place than the ones on columbia 
nasa will rely more on visual evidence of hydrogen leaks during 
fueling for future flights and use different criteria for sensors 
lenoir said

liberian rebels have killed 200 
foreign civilians from the five nations that make up a west african 
task force in liberia the ghana news agency said friday the 
killings came in retaliation for the forces presence there the 
agency said 
a ghana news agency correspondent with the west african force 
said rebels loyal to charles taylor began attacking the civilians 
shortly after the troops debarked in monrovia on aug 25 to try to 
end the 8monthold civil war 
taylor opposes any intervention in the conflict 
no immediate response came friday from taylor who confirmed on 
thursday that he was holding thousands of foreign citizens 
the task force fought its way to the eastern edge of monrovia 
and took control of the capitals airport diplomatic sources said 
in freetown speaking on condition of anonymity 
the air strip is big enough to handle military transport planes 
controlling it will make resupplying the force much easier 
about 3000 soldiers from ghana nigeria guinea sierra leone 
and gambia are under orders to end the conflict which turned into 
a tribal war 
the spriggs payne airfield had been in the hands of president 
samuel does troops but was under fire almost daily from taylors 
rebels camped less than a mile away 
the british broadcasting corp said a spokesman for prince 
johnson who broke with taylor and leads a rival rebel group 
called friday to report does troops broke an informal truce and 
attacked johnsons men killing 21 of them 
doe and johnson had both welcomed intervention by the west 
african force and declared a truce more than a week ago 
the task force pushed eastward toward the embassies of three 
member states guinea ghana and nigeria which lay just behind 
rebel lines the rebels had rounded up thousands of guineans 
ghanaians and nigerians who had taken refuge at their embassies 
saying they were being held for their own protection 
the ghana news agency quoted ghanaians who it said escaped the 
attack and said thousands more were waiting outside monrovias 
port for a ship that would take them home 
ghanaian teacher kwasi kwateng 36 said rebels attacked a 
community of 2500 ghanaians living in barnesville about 3 miles 
from monrovias port 
the agency gave no specifics about this or other alleged 
attacks however and there was no confirmation from other sources 
kweku egyir 52 a ghanaian who has lived in liberia since 1963 
said taylors men were looking for ghanaians and nigerians in 
particular because their members of the african force had inflicted 
many casualties on the rebels 
egyir said the rebels could identify ghanaians and nigerians by 
their accents and tribal scars the marks on our faces are called 
identity cards in this country he said 
few details emerged on the fighting the task force easily 
repulsed several attacks by taylors men using its heavy artillery 
and armored cars according to nigerian and ghanaian correspondents 
traveling with the force 
taylor invaded from ivory coast on dec 24 calling does 
government corrupt and pledging to overthrow it his fighters 
quickly overran most of the west african country of about 25 
million people but were stopped on the outskirts of the capital 
johnson who split with taylor in february led his men through 
swamps on monrovias northern outskirts in a surprise attack on 
does troops johnsons rebels took control of much of the capital 
city of about 400000 liberians but were unable to drive doe from 
his heavily fortified mansion 
us marines stationed on warships off liberia evacuated 
americans and some other foreigners from monrovia marines also 
remained posted around the us embassy but washington says us 
forces will not intervene in the fighting which has killed about 
5000 people mostly civilians 
the west african group said in sending its task force that the 
liberian conflict concerned their nations because their citizens in 
liberia were involved and because 400000 liberian refugees are 
straining the resources of neighboring countries

in a major breakthrough in cambodian 
peace talks that countrys government said friday it is ready to 
accept as a basis for discussion a un proposal already approved 
by the guerrilla resistance 
the announcement capped four days of progress in efforts to 
reach a settlement of the 11yearold civil war on tuesday the 
united states and four other permanent members of the un security 
council proposed a un interim administration with five key 
cambodian ministries placed in its hands during the transition 
in new york us officials tried friday to win vietnams 
approval of the un plan however vietnam which installed the 
cambodian government in a 1978 invasion and remains its main 
backer was noncommittal 
the state department has said it is linking vietnamese 
cooperation on cambodia with the possibility of normalizing 
relations with the united states in july the united states 
nervous about battlefield gains by a communist rebel faction said 
it was ending diplomatic recognition of the guerrilla alliance and 
opening talks with vietnam on ending the war 
on friday a cambodian official said his government accepts a 
major role played by the united nations during the transitional 
period notably the right to organize free and fair elections 
i think that it the un plan could constitute a basis for 
the discussions among the cambodian parties said hor nam hong 
the deputy prime minister in charge of foreign affairs in remarks 
carried by the official cambodian news agency and monitored in 
bangkok 
the five permanent un security council members have said up to 
20000 un employees would be sent to shore up the truce and guide 
the southeast asian nation to democracy 
the communist cambodian government of prime minister hun sen is 
battling a guerrilla coalition composed of the communist khmer 
rouge and two noncommunist groups one headed by prince norodom 
sihanouk and the other by son sann 
the united states has supported the two noncommunist rebel 
groups and china has armed the khmer rouge 
when vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 it ended a nearly 
fouryear khmer rouge reign in which hundreds of thousands of 
people died in execution chambers and slave labor camps 
hor nam hong said his governemnt was ready for peace talks 
anywhere anytime he said talks scheduled to take place soon in 
jakarta indonesia should finalize the composition of a supreme 
national council establish where and when it will meet and 
discuss the un peace plan 
however indonesian foreign minister ali alatas said friday in 
jakarta that he was unsure if the session would occur because of 
unclear signals from the cambodian government he said he expected 
a definite answer from cambodia within three days 
alatas said the jakarta meeting if held should take place in 
the first two weeks of september 
in june hun sen and sihanouk agreed to form a supreme national 
council to arrange a truce and play a role in the period before 
elections but the khmer rouge has rejected the agreement 
demanding that it be given the same number of seats on the council 
as hun sens government 
the guerrillas want either the council or the united nations as 
the interim government while hun sen wants to retain power during 
the transitional period he had said earlier the un role 
generally should be limited to organizing elections 
in his remarks hor nam hong said his government agreed that 
certain important ministries could be temporarily supervised by 
the united nations 
the united states has supported the two noncommunist rebel 
groups and china has armed the khmer rouge 
the security council plan would entail the united nations most 
extensive peacekeeping effort 
the plan covers arrangements for running cambodia during the 
preelection period a temporary military setup elections under 
un auspices human rights protection and international 
guarantees that cambodia will be nonaligned and democratic

the fine print in a republican 
fundraising campaign that has sent 25 checks to 700000 people 
nationwide is under investigation by attorneys general in at least 
two states 
on the back of the 25 check the fine print says the recipient 
authorizes the bank to transfer 1250 out of his account each 
month to the national republican senatorial committee 
oregons attorney general dave frohnmayer on friday urged the 
committee to halt the campaign minnesota attorney general hubert 
h humphrey iii said his office also is investigating the campaign 
frohnmayer a republican was asked thursday to investigate the 
matter by secretary of state barbara roberts his democratic 
opponent in the governors race 
as im sure you will agree roberts wrote this mailing is 
an unconscionable attempt to exploit the vulnerability of people 
who cannot read fine print or who for some other reason may not 
succeed in deciphering the real purpose of the mailing and who 
will as a result suffer financial hardship 
frohnmayer concurred 
this fundraising gimmick by the national republican 
senatorial committee is a bad idea he told the associated press 
while our professional staff pursues the consumer protection 
aspect i will urge the national committee to pull it its bad 
public policy and its bad politics 
in washington dc gop committee spokeswoman wendy burnley 
said the program is explained on the check and the accompanying 
letter she said electronic bank transfers or candidate escrow 
fundraising as the letter describes them have become routine and 
arent confusing 
we have a good deal of faith in the american people that they 
will open this up read the letter and will understand it she 
said theres absolutely no possibility whatsoever for people not 
to realize what they are doing 
she said the letter includes a tollfree number for people to 
call for more information or if they want to cancel membership in 
the program she also said the committee will give refunds to 
anybody who asks 
burnley said the committees lawyers approved the campaign the 
solicitation accompanying the check urges people to call the 
committee at the end of two months if they want to stop the bank 
transfers

in whos who in the republican party the letter said the bank 
transfer program will allow the committee to reduce mailing 
administrative and postage costs 
its the third mailing this year to draw criticism for the

charge would go up by 10 percent a year the new checks omit that 
provision and provide the tollfree number

the iraqi government is adding new and 
confusing layers of bureaucratic red tape to delay the promised 
departure of american women and children the state department said 
friday 
the iraqis insist on stringing this out and putting all of 
these innocent people through this cruel ordeal said margaret 
tutwiler the departments spokeswoman every time we think we 
have figured their demands out they change them 
but iraqi ambassador mohamed sadiq almashat said iraq was 
arranging the departure of americans and other westerners in an 
organized fashion and that ms tutwilers accusations are 
absolutely not true 
we are in an emergency situation and we have our own 
priorities almashat told reporters who questioned him after he 
was summoned to the state department the priority is to protect 
the country 
the news media he said is casting iraqs actions in the worst 
possible light 
they are forgetting that iraq is being held as a hostage and 
that the threat is against iraqis he said 
the government of president saddam hussein has confirmed that 
his pledge to permit the departure of women and children applies to 
people in occupied kuwait as well as those iraq she said 
however the nearly 3000 americans in iraq and kuwait have been 
divided into categories each with a different exit requirement 
ms tutwiler said 
she declined to say what the categories are because of the 
changing nature of the requirements 
the information that we have is so convoluted and confusing 
that it would be unfair to put the information out at this time 
she said 
dividing the american and other foreign hostages into categories 
comes on the heels of other newly created iraqi exit requirements 
under the new government orders all those wishing to leave must 
write letters expressing their intentions have the letters 
translated into arabic and obtain official government stamps 
certifying that all iraqi taxes have been paid 
ms tutwiler said five more americans had been rounded up by 
iraqi authorities one american woman was granted an exit visa and 
was allowed to leave for amman jordan 
the united states has asked for permission to send a charter 
aircraft to baghdad to evacuate americans but has received no 
response ms tutwiler said further reports have been received of 
americans escaping iraq on their own she said 
ms tutwiler said joseph wilson the highest ranking diplomat at 
the us embassy in baghdad was told thursday he could meet with 
americans held at a hotel 
but he was not allowed to enter the hotel when he arrived she 
said adding that a consular officer was later permitted to speak 
to 14 american women and children at the hotel 
all of the women and children that we saw seem to be well and 
had their passports she said 
wilson was allowed to visit the hotel friday morning after 
lodging a protest with the iraqi foreign ministry he met with 
three americans one man and two women 
ms tutwiler said wilson was told the us embassy should submit 
the passports of all arabborn american men with the passports of 
all american women and children 
but she said that when a us official took the travel documents 
to an iraqi government office he was told there had been a 
change and was sent away

his role in funneling military procurement data to a defense 
contractor 
saunders was sentenced by us district judge albert v bryan 
jr for his role in the pentagon procurement scandal that is the 
subject of a longrunning justice department investigation dubbed 
operation ill wind 
the investigation has resulted in nearly 40 convictions of

sold it to norden systems according to trial testimony 
saunders obtained the information from former navy procurement 
official george g stone who pleaded guilty to participating in 
the scheme and passed it along to defense consultant thomas e

three norden executives have already pleaded guilty to taking 
part in the operation

contract at the request of saunders norden dropped out of the 
competition after the ill wind investigation became public two 
years ago

president mikhail s gorbachev blamed iraqi leader 
saddam hussein on friday for the very dangerous situation in 
the persian gulf but noted his nation still favors a diplomatic 
solution 
we have to understand that an escalation of a military 
confrontation is always fraught with unpredictable consequences 
he said that is why we have to act responsibly all of us to 
prevent a largescale military conflict i believe this is our 
common goal and we are promoting this idea 
only those who think illogically can reject such a solution 
and i include the president of iraq in that it makes the 
situation explosive very dangerous 
he rebuked assertions that the kremlins lack of military 
presence in the gulf indicated a slip in the nations world status 
some people think we lose our prestige and reputation it is 
not so he said i think that everything will depend on whether 
we are successful in using political measures 
deputy foreign minister alexander belonogov told a parliamentary 
committee thursday that there are no guarantees the united 
states will remove its troops from the gulf region if the conflict 
is settled according to the state news agency tass 
and the soviet commander of the warsaw pact military alliance 
gen vladimir n lobov also warned that us forces in the gulf 
would alter the global strategic balance 
but gorbachev said the us deployment in saudi arabia was 
permissible under the un charter and said he believed its troops 
would eventually withdraw 
i believe that when a solution has been found we will be able 
to provide guarantees he added and i believe that the sooner 
we have a military detente after that the more calm we all will 
feel 
although the soviet support for military action in the gulf has 
been lukewarm not since world war ii has the nation cooperated so 
fully with the us and other western nations during a world crisis 
the soviet union voted in favor of a un security council 
resolution authorizing the use of force to impose sanctions against 
iraq but balked at joining a usled naval blockade 
the kremlin quickly halted its arms shipments to iraq but it 
has not withdrawn 193 soviet military specialists and 5000 
construction workers stationed there under contract with the iraqi 
government 
it pulled its diplomats out of kuwait after iraq ordered foreign 
governments to close their embassies the united states and several 
other countries have defied iraqs mandate

organization to be called the international arctic science 
committee the national academy of sciences said friday 
signing the agreement were organizations from canada denmark 
finland iceland norway sweden the soviet union and united 
states the founding articles were signed at a remote scientific 
outpost in resolute canada 
the national academy of sciences the us organization that 
signed the agreement will help coordinate the research of 
countries that maintain active arctic science programs and help 
integrate arctic studies with the research on the global 
environment 
membership in the iasc is open to all countries with significant

improved relations between the east and west and a greater 
importance given to arctic cooperation between the soviet union and 
the united states were decisive factors in reaching the 
agreement the statement said 
scientific interest in both the north and south polar regions 
has grown in recent times because of concern about global warming

caused by the socalled greenhouse effect are expected to be 
greatest in the polar areas 
experts believe that global warming could lead to shrinkage of 
the polar sea ice fields the thawing of permanently frozen soils 
melting of glaciers and ice sheets and a worldwide rise in the sea 
level

environment minister klaus toepfer 
said soviet authorities should urgently check the concrete safety 
cap encasing the chernobyl nuclear power plant a newspaper 
reported saturday 
the soviet plant was the site of the worlds worst atomic 
accident a 1986 fire and explosion that spewed radioactive cesium 
strontium and plutonium over a wide area of the ukraine 
byelorussia and russia 
a reactor at the plant was shut down monday the soviet 
government newspaper izvestia reported earlier this week 
there is certainly an urgent need to precisely pursue and 
examine the present condition of this security cover the 
respected newspaper die welt quoted toepfer as saying 
on thursday the colognebased deutschlandfunk radio station 
quoted unidentified soviet experts as saying they feared the 
reactor floor could give way from the weight of concrete slabs and 
release huge amounts of radioactivity 
according to deutschlandfunk the soviet experts said the only 
solution may be to tear down the concrete encasing and build a new 
one 
izvestia gave no further details on the shutdown of the no 3 
reactor at chernobyl it said established safety standards were 
not violated 
in the die welt interview toepfer did not indicate whether 
there was imminent danger 
but he did urge the cover be examined saying a leak could 
lead to widespread contamination very quickly the newspaper 
reported 
it the cover surrounds a massive inventory of radioactive 
fission products die welt quoted him as saying 
toepfer said his ministry is in contact with the soviets about 
chernobyl 
he also said the international atomic energy organization in 
vienna and nations within the international partnership should 
get involved in making sure chernnobyl is safe reported die welt 
it was chernobyls reactor no 4 that caught fire and exploded 
on april 26 1986 official reports say 31 people were killed in 
the partial meltdown but unofficial reports say 250 died four 
years after the accident more than 2 million people are still 
living on contaminated lands in the region 
the accident sent a cloud of radiation over large parts of 
northern and central europe leading to bans on foodstuffs from 
several countries 
the plant is 80 miles north of the ukraine capital of kiev

postal officials are redfaced about reports 
that they want americans to have a white christmas 
not so says richard j strasser senior assistant postmaster 
general for marketing and customer service strassers comments 
came after postal officials in kansas city told area residents 
earlier this week that they should never use red green or any 
dark colored envelopes 
if people buy christmas cards that come with envelopes that are 
red or green or some other color the postal service will deliver 
them happily strasser said friday 
americans send one another some 2 billion cards annually 
millions in colored envelopes 
white envelopes are easier for the agencys automated machinery 
to handle strasser admitted darkcolored backgrounds can make the 
addresses written on them very hard to read 
they are a challenge but we can handle it he said 
how did the misunderstanding start some postal workers may have 
been too enthusiastic in discussing the benefits of the new 
automatic letter sorting equipment strasser said 
strasser said the postal service and the makers of greeting 
cards have been working together to develop envelope colors that 
are attractive but can easily be handled by automatic sorting 
machinery 
but in the meantime no envelope that is sold will be rejected 
he said

a study found that people near the three 
mile island nuclear power plant have a higher risk of some cancers 
but saw no solid evidence that radiation from the plants 1979 
accident was a factor its authors said friday 
the study which reviewed hospital records of 160000 people 
living within 10 miles of the plant also found no significant 
relation between exposure to radiation during the accident and 
childhood cancers or leukemia 
the study which used data from 1975 through 1985 appears to 
corroborate previous government reports which found no detrimental 
health effects linked to the accident which damaged the unit 2 
reactor and led to a 1 billion cleanup 
overall the pattern of results does not provide convincing 
evidence that radiation releases from the three mile island nuclear 
facility influenced cancer risk during the limited period of the 
followup the study concluded 
but two authors of the report columbia university 
epidemiologist maureen hatch and three mile island public health 
fund investigator dr jan beyea acknowledged that some findings 
showed increased cancer risks they said those risks did not appear 
linked to the accident 
for example there were 34 cases of lymphoma cancer in 198485 
other than hodgkins disease that indicated a twofold increase in 
the risk for residents who were living in the areas north and west 
of the plant where the highest radiation doses occurred at the 
time of the accident the report said 
but previous studies have not linked lymphoma cancer with 
radiation even in high doses the report pointed out 
the study was funded by a 700000 grant from the health fund 
which was established by a 1981 court order to pay for the study of 
public health issues related to the accident the findings were 
published in the september issue of the american journal of 
epidemiology 
the study also found there were 1529 total cases of cancer 
excluding lung cancer from 1975 to 1979 that figure jumped to 
2391 from 1981 to 1985 ms hatch said the disparity might have 
been caused by faulty recordkeeping at hospitals which were just 
beginning to computerize records in the mid1970s 
another increase in risk was noted for lung cancer but the 
report concluded that an effect of plant emissions in producing 
the unusual patterns of lung cancer and nonhodgkins lymphoma 
appears unlikely and alternative explanations need to be 
considered the effect of smoking was one explanation cited for 
lung cancer 
the report was greeted with skepticism by some members of the 
community around tmi located about 10 miles south of harrisburg on 
an island in the susquehanna river 
kay pickering a spokeswoman for three mile island alert a 
citizens group said a more exhaustive study was needed before 
residents could be sure their health was not affected 
marjorie m aamodt who helped conduct a 1984 survey of 
residents in the area said the study should have included clinical 
examinations of people who suffered illnesses at the time of the 
accident 
a 1985 state health department study the first of its kind 
after the accident found no pattern of increased cancer cases or 
deaths but did turn up isolated instances of higherthanexpected 
cancer cases in several communities downwind from the plant the 
new study dismissed those cases as statistically insignificant 
a 1984 survey conducted by mrs aamodt and her husband found 
cancer deaths up to seven times higher than expected in sections of 
newberry and fairview townships near the plant the health 
department judged that survey invalid because it appeared to focus 
on streets where cancer victims lived 
there are about 2000 lawsuits pending against the owners of tmi 
for alleged health effects stemming from the accident 
the accident occurred after a combination of human and 
mechanical errors allowed protective cooling water to drain from 
the reactor some of the reactors uranium fuel rods melted and 
radioactive gases and particles were released to the environment 
it was the worst accident at a commercial nuclear power plant in 
the united states

iraqs foreign minister said friday his 
country has no intention of igniting the explosive situation 
and all foreigners in iraq could leave if the united nations could 
produce guarantees against military attack 
foreign minister tariq aziz spoke after emerging from his second 
meeting of the day with un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar 
if such guarantees are provided then the situation of the 
foreigners would be resolved aziz said 
iraq doesnt have any intention of igniting the explosive 
situation in the persian gulf he said 
perez de cuellar called the talks a step forward 
he said he welcomed iraqs earlier decision to let western women 
and children go free but he said that was not enough he did not 
comment on azizs call for guarantees against attack by the west 
aziz asked later if progress was made to defuse the crisis 
told the associated press inshallah arabic for god 
willing then he added 
you should advise mr bush to withdraw his troops from saudi 
arabia 
aziz and perez de cuellar emerged smiling after five hours of 
talks and agreed to meet again saturday after experts discussed 
specific points they seek to settle the regional crisis set off by 
iraqs aug 2 invasion and subsequent annexation of kuwait 
their longawaited talks created such a stir that one reporter 
was pushed into a hotel lobby pool in the news medias crush to 
approach them 
iraq has been holding an estimated 21000 westerners including 
3000 americans it said tuesday women and children would be 
allowed to go free but men must remain 
iraqs us ambassador mohammad almashat said all foreigners 
could leave if america gave assurances that the usled 
multinational force in the persian gulf region would not attack 
iraq 
a senior jordanian source who had access to both sessions 
called fridays talks an excellent meeting with so many positive 
points 
he said both sides were optimistic about resolving the military 
standoff but a political settlement could be thorny 
iraq insisted on the conviction that there should be a 
comprehensive peace solution for all middle east crises said the 
source a ranking official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
aziz touched on this at a news conference denouncing a double 
standard against arabs he said the palestine question lebanon 
and other problems must be linked to talks on kuwait 
perez de cuellar replied when asked if he would go to baghdad to 
see president saddam hussein that is not in the cards 
the un chief made clear upon his arrival in amman thursday 
that his negotiating room was scant he said his role was defined 
by un resolutions 
the security council cut off iraq with economic sanctions and 
then pressed by president bush gave western warships a vaguely 
defined right to enforce it 
un members unanimously condemned iraqs seizure of kuwait 
the secretarygeneral said friday that iraqs release of 
foreigners would very much help to lessen the tension in the 
area but that a solution to the complex situation could not be 
expected in a day of discussions 
aziz made a similar point 
pushing for speedy dramatic things is not the only or the 
best way he said let us not forget the age of this crisis is 
only days you cannot resolve this by magical solutions we must 
find patience and we need some quiet diplomacy 
perez de cuellar told reporters that because the first session 
was useful the second session was arranged with the un and iraqi 
delegations present 
aziz standing next to the secretarygeneral said he was happy 
to meet an old friend we have confidence in him 
the two men got to know one another during long negotiations for 
a peace treaty to end the eightyear iraniraq war a unbrokered 
ceasefire stopped the fighting in august 1988 
fridays meetings were at the royal palace in amman king 
hussein meantime flew to london from madrid on a 10nation search 
for peace in the region 
attention focused on a diplomatic solution as both iraq and the 
multinational force aligned against it sought to back away from war 
threats but both sides held firm in their declarations of resolve

mohawk protesters on friday allowed more 
barricades to be dismantled at a montreal bridge but they kept up 
their armed standoff in this town to the west 
after a week of seesaw efforts to settle the 52day land 
dispute the status of talks were unclear a provincial goahead 
for the canadian army to take down barricades in oka remained in 
effect but troops were apparently waiting in the hope a negotiated 
settlement could be reached 
the standoff began july 11 when the quebec provincial police 
attempted to storm a mohawk barricade at oka 18 miles west of 
montreal one officer was killed but it is still not clear by 
whose gunfire 
the indians are protesting a plan to expand a golf course on 
land they claim as theirs later on july 11 fellow mohawks set up 
the blockade in sympathy at the mercier bridge a major link 
between montreal and its southern suburbs 
on friday an army spokesman said work continued at the mercier 
bridge to remove barricades with the consent of mohawks from the 
local kanewake reserve by friday afternoon all the main 
barricades on the five routes leading to the bridge were removed 
said army spokesman lt francois rousseau 
there was a lot of cooperation and nobody was nervous im 
surprised to see the work going so fast he said for now 
things are running pretty smoothly 
serge forest a quebec transport department spokesman said it 
will be several more days before the bridge can be opened to 
traffic 
the local army commander lt col robin gagnon worked out an 
agreement with mohawk representative jack leclaire for both sides 
to start tearing down the barricades there wednesday however 
mohawks said thursday that authorities were harassing them and 
work was abruptly halted

two cosmonauts who made emergency repairs outside 
their damaged spacecraft said friday that the job demanded a cool 
head but they denied earlier reports they had risked running out 
of oxygen 
the 179day mission by alexander solovyev and alexander 
balandin which ended with their return to earth on aug 9 is 
expected to show a 21 million profit the deputy mission chief 
said he said it is the first in the 33year history of the soviet 
space program 
the two cosmonauts walked in space for seven hours on july 17 to 
repair insulation surrounding the space capsule that would take 
them back to earth before finishing the repairs they discovered a 
problem with the porthole leading back to the orbiting space 
station mir forcing them to return through an emergency hatch 
soviet media reported their life support supplies were running 
dangerously low by the time they returned to mir 
solovyev told a news conference friday each cosmonaut had 10 
hours of oxygen in their main tank plus reserve supplies 
we consumed only twothirds of our main balloon of oxygen 
so we had reserves he said 
he said the spacewalk was one of the hardest moments of the 
mission but that cosmonauts train for such crises 
im sure that men who are not prepared who do not expect such 
situations will not cope with it solovyev said in that 
situation we were quite calm even coldblooded if i may say so 
about the decisions we were taking 
the cosmonauts made a second space walk on july 26 to finish the 
repairs and retrieve some equipment they left behind attached to 
the capsules exterior 
deputy mission chief viktor blagov told the news conference that 
the mission the sixth to the orbiting space station cost 134 
million 
but he forecast revenue of 155 million through the sale of 
highdefinition photographs of the earths surface and of pure 
crystals developed in space for use in semiconductors and computer 
chips 
so from a program of scientific investigation it is being 
turned into a program for economic benefit blagov said 
the soviet space program for decades a source of national 
pride has come under increasing pressure in recent years to prove 
its worth as the country grapples with consumer shortages and other 
economic woes 
for the last two years the program has suffered from docking 
equipment malfunctions mistakes by cosmonauts and budget cuts 
blagov said the space program will continue to put even more 
emphasis on commercial activities 
the soviets have also agreed to take a paying customer into 
space in december two employees of the tokyo broadcasting system 
are vying for the seat

the american who died while being held 
captive in iraq was a banking consultant who had been in the middle 
of his second year in kuwait relatives say 
an autopsy performed in iraq with an american doctor present 
showed james l worthington jr 53 died of a heart attack the 
state department said friday 
he didnt have high blood pressure but he was at risk by some 
other things said tim neilson soninlaw of the banker who 
lived in woodstock when he was not working overseas he smoked 
cigarettes and drank a lot of coffee 
worthington had signed a second yearlong contract as a 
consultant for the alahi bank of kuwait in january relatives told 
the kingston freeman 
he was taken hostage in kuwait and moved to basra where he 
died of a heart attack said worthingtons daughter maggie jean 
neilson 
worthington may have been moved to a strategic location near an 
iraqi oil field in the southern port of basra as part of iraqi 
president saddam husseins human shield she said 
now that hes not coming home well never really know what 
happened said ms neilson 27 
she said her family had no reason to fear for her fathers 
safety until the notification from the state department of his 
death 
wed get letters every week and mom would have phone calls 
she could call there there was a direct line neilson said 
there was no indication of danger he didnt feel any differently 
about it than anyone else over there they were all caught with the 
same degree of suprise we spent our whole lives overseas so 
it was just another post 
before moving to kuwait worthington worked for 28 years in 
various foreign branches of citibank he and his family were 
stationed in colombia brazil liberia indonesia singapore 
india and at the main branch in new york city just prior to his 
tenure in kuwait ms neilson said 
we moved around every five years she said 
relatives and friends told the kingston freeman they did not 
want to divulge too much about what they learned about 
worthingtons death 
the reason nothing much is being said now is that were at the 
mercy of saddam hussein the family wont speak to other media 
because this is a precious personal thing all the facts as of this 
interview is all there will be said don badgley a family friend 
the state department said the fact that a heart attack killed 
worthington in no way diminishes the inhumane treatment which may 
have contributed to his death 
he was clearly under stress said margaret tutwiler the 
departments press secretary he didnt have access to decent 
medical facilities we want to make clear to iraqi officials that 
we hold them responsible for the safety and wellbeing of all 
americans

annexations relatively lowcost housing 
and a swelling immigrant population contributed to making fresno 
the quickest growing of the nations top 50 cities over the past 
decade 
in 1980 there were 218202 people in fresno the preliminary 
1990 census figures push the population to 350794 a 61 percent 
growth rate in just 10 years that boosted fresno from the nations 
65thlargest city to 47th 
mayor karen humphrey said the numbers did not exactly surprise 
her but they do present some challenges to the city in 
californias central valley about 180 miles southeast of san 
francisco 
i think that this is a dynamic exciting community with a very 
good lifestyle she said the rapidity of the growth challenges 
us to preserve that quality of life 
since 1980 the city has annexed 21951 acres with 14457 
housing units beedle said the estimated population increase from 
the annexation is 38300 people 
yet an even larger population shift in the city has come from 
the influx of southeast asian refugees 
approximately 47000 refugees have been absorbed city 
planner donn beedle said thats a large chunk of people coming 
in 
the refugees are attracted to fresno by both the areas 
agriculture and low housing costs he said 
a lot of these people know about agriculture and they would 
gravitate to an area that they could get jobs and property 
beedle said 
central valley towns traditionally also have attracted many 
immigrants from mexico and central america 
another reason people come here is the attractive housing 
market while all of californias cities are growing quickly it is 
the valley communities that are the most affordable fresnos 
average home costs around 100000 compared to 250000 in the san 
francisco or los angeles areas 
although the census data is only preliminary beedle said the 
city is already rechecking the numbers to see if they tally with 
city figures 
historically speaking the census undercounts us he said

us senate minority leader robert 
dole expressed strong reservations about the governments 
humanrights record friday but extended an invitation to prime 
minister petre roman to visit washington 
the kansas republican leading a delegation of seven senators on 
an eightnation 11day tour told reporters roman should have a 
chance to talk to congressmen about the rights situation in the 
country 
state radio quoted roman as responding that he would be happy 
to go to the us to hold a very open dialogue with all those 
interested in romania he said such a visit would have 
exceptional importance 
the united states has strongly criticized the romanian 
government for its conduct during a june demonstration and its 
aftermath 
six people were killed as police acted to end antigovernment 
violence thousands of miners responding to a call by president 
ion iliescu to help quell street opposition subsequently 
terrorized the capital for several days 
roman and iliescu have been in power since the december 
revolution that ousted communist dictator nicolae ceausescu first 
on an interim basis then as part of a democratically elected 
government after their national salvation front scored an 
overwhelming victory in may 
speaking after meeting with roman iliescu and opposition and 
labor leaders dole said that we know there have been great 
changes since last dec 22 but we think additional changes could 
be made and should be made 
we have strong reservations he continued obviously 
compared to ceausescu anything in the world is better but that 
doesnt mean that its the way it should be 
he said he was concerned about mass arrests made after 
antigovernment demonstrations delays in issuing passports and the 
continuing state monopoly over the mass media 
dole insisted that congress will have to be satisfied that the 
human rights record in this country is exemplary before restoring 
romanias most favored nation trading status lost in 1988 and 
allocating largescale humanitarian and other aid 
sen alfonse m damato of new york said he would probably 
support restoration of the clause after being told by opposition 
leaders here that they would welcome such a step 
the senate delegation also includes john warner of virginia 
jake garn of utah steven symms of idaho don nickles of oklahoma 
and connie mack of florida 
they left for czechoslovakia friday they already visited

the national centers for disease control has 
discontinued the research monkey breeding program at its suburban 
lawrenceville facility after 14 primates died there of heatstroke 
the atlantabased cdc is keeping open the lawrenceville research 
station which performs rabies research and raises other animals 
but 116 monkeys bred at the facility were shipped this week to a 
federally funded primate center at covington la cdc public 
affairs director don berreth said friday 
fourteen rhesus monkeys died of heatstroke on july 9 after 
handlers placed them outside to recover from anesthesia on a day 
when temperatures reached 96 degrees 
cdc researchers said the deaths were puzzling as rhesus monkeys 
are routinely found in hot areas of india and asia 
cdcs decision to phase out its monkey breeding program was made 
before the heatstroke deaths but it was clearly accelerated by 
controversy over the deaths berreth said 
with wider commercial availability of laboratory monkeys in 
recent years we simply no longer have the kind of need for 
monkeys we had before berreth said 
cdc officials said the july 9 mishap was the worst loss of 
primates in the agencys history 
the monkeys had been anesthetized so handlers could deworm them 
and test them for a primate aids virus and for tuberculosis they 
had not yet been placed into research projects

the soviet union and the united states for example regularly 
exchange views whereas there are no regular consultations between 
the soviet union and china rogachev told the official tass news 
agency therefore such consultations will be very important

changes in the soviet union and eastern europe 
the talks will focus on ways to lower military confrontation

tass 
north korea one of the worlds last hardline communist 
countries is especially unhappy over gorbachevs overtures to its 
bitter enemy south korea gorbachev met with south korean 
president roh taewoo in san francisco in june and the two 
countries have been working to establish diplomatic ties 
shevardnadze is scheduled to arrive tuesday in japan to resolve 
what he called issues that have piled up for decades 
foreign ministry officials said he would lay the groundwork for 
a visit by gorbachev next year and push for a peace treaty formally 
ending world war ii 
relations between the two countries have long been strained over 
japans demand that the soviet union return the kuril islands a 
small chain off northern japan seized by the soviets in the last 
days of the war moscow claims them historically as russian

east last week were placed in a foster home friday officials said 
the children are fine said charles wilson director of 
child welfare for the state department of human services 
two boys 13 and 9 and their 12yearold sister were without 
food or hot water when they were found wednesday at their home

battalion could face charges when he returns from military duty 
authorities said 
public affairs officer bill harralson said friday that army 
officials had not been able to reach savaiki who left saudi arabia 
for american samoa thursday after learning that his mother was ill 
we dont know if hes still en route or if hes at the 
hospital harralson said once the emergency is over they are 
directing him to return to the base instead of saudi arabia

savaiki and returned to hawaii three weeks ago police were called 
in wednesday night after a member of savaikis company checked on 
the children 
the children who had been attending school were alone in a

out of the bank with an automatic teller card and telling the 
children which bills to pay 
they didnt have any money at the time they hadnt bought 
anything there was nothing in the house for them to eat the house

normally officials would try to locate relatives to care for such 
children we try to keep them in a similar environment he said 
peggy jones a neighbor of the savaikis said she had seen the 
children leaving for school and returning in the afternoon

the prime minister of north korea will 
visit south korean president roh taewoo next week in what is 
viewed as a first step toward mutual recognition by the rival 
nations 
north korean premier yon hyong muk will pay a courtesy call on 
roh during four days of talks with south korean officials on easing 
tension on the divided korean peninsula officials said 
in their official declarations capitalist south korea and 
communist north korea bitterly divided since 1945 each claims 
sole representation for the entire peninsula 
the north korean premier accompanied by about 90 aides and 
reporters will cross the heavily armed border tuesday for 
unprecedented talks with his south korean counterpart kang 
younghoon he is scheduled to return home friday 
the prime ministers talks will be the highest level meeting 
ever between the hostile nations the meeting will focus on easing 
more than four decades of military and political enmity 
an official itinerary released friday did not include any 
schedule for yons courtesy call on roh but government officials 
said it will take place thursday 
in earlier working negotiations the two koreas agreed to hold a 
second round of prime ministers talks in the north korean capital 
of pyongyang on oct 1619 
the prime ministers talks in seoul will be held at a luxury 
hotel near the olympic stadium with about 3000 police deployed for 
security officials said 
south korean officials attach great significance to the talks 
but longtime observers doubt that any substantial progress can be 
made because the premiers of both nations are mostly figureheads 
without policy roles 
north korea has said the talks should deal mainly with ways to 
ease political and military tensions south korean officials insist 
that priority be given to nonpolitical exchanges to promote mutual 
confidence 
north korea has proposed drastic arms reductions cutting the 
troop level of both sides to 100000 each north korea has more 
than 1 million troops while south korea has 650000 
the north koreans also demand withdrawal of the 43000 us 
troops stationed in south korea under a mutual defense treaty but 
south korea opposes any drastic measures like arms cuts before an 
extended period of confidence building 
the two nations fought a threeyear war in the early 1950s 
their border is sealed without mail or direct communication 
they have held talks on and off since the early 1970s but failed 
to make major progress

people with heart disease who exercise in 
air laden with carbon monoxide are likely to suffer irregular 
heartbeats a precursor to sudden death according to a published 
study 
the research by the university of north carolina and the 
environmental protection agency expands on earlier findings that 
even low levels of carbon monoxide are dangerous for the estimated 
9 million americans with heart disease 
an editorial accompanying the report in saturdays annals of 
internal medicine said the epas carbon monoxide regulations should 
be better enforced rather than tightened 
about onethird of the us population almost 78 million 
people live in areas that exceed the outdoor carbon monoxide 
limits of 9 parts per million in eight hours or 35 parts per 
million in one hour the epa says 
carbon monoxide reduces the bloods ability to carry oxygen by 
binding to hemoglobin a protein that ferries oxygen from the lungs 
to the heart the pollutant changes the proteins structure to a 
form called carboxyhemoglobin which cant transport oxygen 
the average level of carboxyhemoglobin in nonsmokers is about 
15 percent while the epa regulations are designed to protect 
against a 3 percent level 
the study examined the heartbeats of 41 nonsmokers with heart 
disease who were exposed to two concentrations of carbon monoxide 
before riding exercise bicycles the study was designed to raise 
the level of carboxyhemoglobin to either 4 percent or 6 percent a 
level commonly found in smokers 
at levels of 6 percent the number of multiple irregular 
heartbeats during exercise was three times greater than normal the 
researchers found the heart irregularities can lead to sudden 
death 
the researchers were surprised to find that the volunteers 
showed little effect on their heartbeat at the 4 percent level 
said the lead author dr david s shep of the university of north 
carolina 
but shep cautioned against politicizing the studys findings 
saying that previous studies found that men with blocked arteries 
suffered chest pains while exercising when exposed to levels of 
only 2 percent carboxyhemoglobin 
the fact that we didnt find effects at 4 percent shouldnt be 
taken to mean that we should liberalize our air quality 
regulations he warned 
the editorialists dr sandra walden and dr sidney gottlieb of 
the johns hopkins university school of medicine said the studys 
implications for environmental regulations are complex 
a simplistic solution may appear to be tighter restrictions of 
automobile and other industrial emissions however without equally 
serious consideration of enforcement issues the effect of tighter 
restrictions alone would be limited they wrote 
gottlieb said it was frightening that low levels of carbon 
monoxide can apparently be dangerous to so many people with heart 
problems or heart disease 
jim raub a health scientist for the epa said the study will 
contribute to a current evaluation of carbon monoxide regulations 
he said the studys results will add to the debate over whether 
tighter restrictions are needed to protect more people 
people who exercise outdoors whether afflicted with heart 
disease or not should exercise early or late in the day to avoid

while white house officials scrambled for 
information during the initial hours of iraqs invasion of kuwait 
atampts own crisis management center was plotting an escape for 
dozens of employees 
an undisclosed number of american telephone amp telegraph co 
employees were among a group of us nationals working in kuwait 
whose companies had security measures in place for such a crisis 
our security director was awakened about 3 oclock in the 
morning by our people in a location in kuwait city atampt 
spokesman herb linnen said friday from washington 
the security director and his staff had the crisis center went 
into action in an hour he said eighteen people have been staffing 
it around the clock ever since 
at the direction of the crisis center carloads of company 
employees in kuwait city formed a caravan within a week of the 
invasion and confronted iraqi tanks and soldiers on a 20hour trek 
through the desert to saudi arabia 
the center at an undisclosed location in northern new jersey 
is a converted conference room stocked with computers maps 
telephones and other communications equipment 
clearly our people in kuwait city who were hearing reports of 
violence against people were nervous linnen said there were 
reports of violence and of rapes 
a telephone line from kuwait city to the crisis center in new 
jersey was left open until it was cut about 24 hours later 
we kept the line open literally as a psychological lifeline to 
those individuals linnen said they wanted to have assurance 
that atampts top management was looking out for their interests 
atampt officials were in contact with other companies he said 
including chiquita brands international in cincinnati westinghouse 
electric corp in pittsburgh and boeing co in seattle 
linnen said more than 20 atampt employees fled kuwait in two 
caravans 
spokesmen from westinghouse and chiquita said they could not 
comment on evacuation efforts or employees who may be in kuwait or 
iraq 
boeing spokesman paul binder said the company had no employees 
in iraq and only two in kuwait who are still believed to be there 
however all three companies said they have procedures to take 
care of overseas employees when and if trouble erupts 
we have a crisis board that meets when something like this 
happens and they monitor the situation as best they can and are in 
contact with various government agencies and other companies when 
appropriate binder said 
families of boeing workers in saudi arabia flew home aug 10 
aboard a new 747400 sent to evacuate them 
in atampts case employees in kuwait were given general 
instructions for reaching safety specific plans were not 
discussed linnen said 
the workers formed a caravan about one week after the aug 2 
invasion and headed toward the saudi border but were turned back 
by iraqi troops 
it was a polite but a firm word that they couldnt pass the 
checkpoint linnen said so they went back and they tried again 
and they got out 
a second caravan made it across the border a week later 
linnen said security reasons prevented him from discussing how 
many people made it to saudi arabia or how many atampt employees are 
still in iraq or kuwait he also declined to identify the route the 
employees traveled or whether it has since been closed 
the centers last contact with atampt workers still in iraq and 
kuwait was last week he said 
the crisis center was created about two years ago he said 
there was a recognition that in the world in which we live 
there are regrettably situations that could plunge employees into 
some kind of jeopardy linnen said it was decided instead of 
everybody scampering in different directions that there should be a 
system to react when employees are put in harms way

air force chief maj gen avihu binnun said 
friday that israels air force is on alert following iraqi threats 
and he urged the united states to remove the iraqi dictator from 
the stage if war breaks out 
but prime minister yitzhak shamir was quoted as saying israel 
was not interested in getting involved directly in the persian gulf 
crisis and was not giving advice to anyone 
binnun interviewed on israel television was asked if fighting 
between the united states and iraq would help israel 
a violent confrontation is never good for anyone but in this 
case apparently there is no other choice but to harm iraqs 
dictator in such a way that would keep the region quiet for a long 
time he responded 
any other action that would not in the end remove the 
iraqi dictator from the stage will in the long run harm us and 
the whole arab world and the region 
the staterun television also broadcast an unusual report 
showing training flights of a squadron of usmade f15 jets and a 
special room where pilots engaged in computer analysis of mock air 
battles conducted earlier in the day 
binnun interviewed in front of an f15 said 
the air force is on a high level of alert in order to give an 
answer to any threat or any hint of a threat to israel its on 
alert every day of the year and especially in these days its 
ready and continues to prepare itself for response to any threat 
that iraqi president saddam hussein dares to make 
the interview was broadcast a day after an unidentified iraqi 
air force commander threatened to respond to a us military action 
with smashing blows to the nests of the israelis 
shamir warned saddam any aggressor would live to regret his 
actions 
but he told visiting british parliamentarians of the friends of 
israel group that israel was determined not to become involved in 
the crisis 
he emphasized and reemphasized that israel had no interest 
whatever in getting involved that israel was not giving advice to 
anyone that israel would of course react if attacked but it hoped 
it would not be labor parliamentarian greville janner said on 
israel radio after a meeting with shamir 
an israeli military source who briefed reporters friday on 
condition of anonymity said israel believed iraq was unlikely now 
to initiate military action against the jewish state but could do 
so if attacked by us and other forces from saudi arabia 
he said the iraqis may believe an attack on israel would give 
them widespread support by arab nations most of which have opposed 
the iraqi invasion and annexation of kuwait 
he added there was no proof iraq could reach israel with 
missiles armed with chemical warheads

the soviet union is swiftly running out of 
essential medicines angering consumers already beset by shortages 
of gasoline tobacco and food 
as early as next february the country may run out of drugs 
completely because the pharmaceutical industry is crumbling even 
more rapidly than the rest of the economy health minister igor 
denisov warned thursday 
we have already seen tobacco riots the workers newspaper 
trud commented shall we now prepare for aspirin riots 
soviets are accustomed to permanent shortages of some goods 
such as winter boots and automobile parts and occasional shortages 
of many others ranging from toothpaste to coffee 
but as president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms have inched the 
soviet union toward a market economy the resulting inflation and 
hoarding have worsened many of the perennial shortages and created 
new ones 
drugs have never been plentiful and denisov said the industry 
is falling further behind he told trud the country met 52 percent 
of the domestic demand for medicine in 1985 but expects to meet 
only 39 percent this year and 30 percent in 1991 
in addition the newspaper moskovskaya pravda said thursday that 
moscow faces a potential bread panic because bakeries are 
unable to keep up with the spurt in demand as residents return to 
the city after august vacations 
gasoline has long been rationed in some soviet cities and even 
in moscow supplies have rarely been ample but the situation has 
grown acute in recent days as car owners have made a run on gas 
stations 
the evening television news program vremya said drivers were 
reacting to rumors the soviet union may export more oil to take 
advantage of higher prices caused by the persian gulf crisis 
in the central asian republic of uzbekistan vremya said people 
were waiting in line all night to buy small amounts of fuel even 
if it wasnt the right kind for their cars 
car owners are panicking the announcer said as the 
television showed people asleep in a line of cars 
a tobacco shortage that began in early summer has fueled street 
protests in half a dozen cities and rioting in siberia in moscow 
where rationing will limit residents to five packs a month starting 
sept 1 jars of cigarette butts are being sold by street vendors 
for 16 
what are we worth a reporter for trud wrote indignantly 
i dont think theres another country in the world much less one 
that claims the title of a great power where cigarette butts are 
sold in the markets of the capital and where people would buy 
them 
felix sarnov a 35yearold chain smoker said he spent a week 
without cigarettes and felt so ill he could hardly get out of bed 
weve never been without tobacco before he said you can 
do without vegetables various foods and things like that but if 
youre a smoker cigarettes are your no 1 need 
on wednesday soviet president mikhail s gorbachev publicly 
berated five senior officials for allowing the tobacco crisis to 
develop on thursday he fired first deputy prime minister vladilen 
nikitin who headed the state commission on foodstuffs and 
purchases 
earlier this week president najibullah of afghanistan sent a 
special plane with 4 million packs of cigarettes to the soviet 
people the government newspaper izvestia reported 
tass on friday said cigarettes are among the items moscow soon 
will purchase from albania ending a 29yearold break in trade 
with that nation 
reasons for the shortages are varied and murky but they show 
that the old central planning system is in a state of collapse 
in the case of tobacco harvests have dwindled and a shortage 
of foreign currency in soviet coffers forced a reduction in 
cigarette imports this year 
the health ministry has said of the medicine shortage only that 
the pharmaceutical industry is crumbling 
but observers say the soviet union has concentrated on producing 
a large volume of a few drugs such as polio vaccine that it can 
sell abroad for hard currency while neglecting the needs of its 
population for birth control pills stomach medications and 
headache remedies those items as well as antibiotics and more 
specialized drugs are in chronic short supply

the government steeply increased 
utility rates friday and announced plans to lay off thousands of 
public employees in an effort to cut the financial deficit and 
stimulate an economy in deep recession 
hours earlier president carlos menem asked his countrymen to 
have patience with his 13monthold government which took office 
amid hyperinflation and recession 
economy minister antonio gonzalez said many public employees 
under contract would be laid off beginning in september and civil 
servants would be forced to retire early he gave no figure but 
analysts said the total would reach at least 80000 of a public 
workforce of 3 million 
gonzalez said gasoline prices for cars would go up 35 percent as 
of saturday and other public service rates would increase by an 
average 12 to 15 percent or about the rate of inflation projected 
for august 
he said his ministry will oversee the 13 biggest state 
companies which until now reported to the public works ministry 
and the major factories that until now were part of the defense 
ministry 
the state airline railroad telphone and other companies must 
pay their debts from their revenue and budgets because the central 
bank no longer will make up their deficits he announced 
the central bank will require all banks that owe it money to 
clear up their accounts those that cannot will be forced out of 
business he said 
argentina is undertaking a profound transformation of the 
public sector gonzalez said in a address on state radio and tv 
the goal is a state that is austere and efficient and 
capable of all the tasks of a modern state 
the measures were imposed by decree 
menems solution to argentinas economic straits has been to 
reduce the role of the state in the economy and spur private 
enterprise 
were looking from the national government to restructure the 
state to do serious surgery on the state and for that sacrifice 
and understanding are needed menem told reporters the party 
is over 
the menem government removed controls on prices and foreign 
exchange linked public service rates and their costs reduced 
import tariffs and export taxes cut the 1990 budget by 4 billion 
encouraged foreign investment and partially deregulated the oil 
industry 
the government also has proposed tax reform and reorganizing the 
central bank to make it more independent 
as a result the increase in the monthly cost of living fell to 
near single digits in july from 197 percent 12 months earlier the 
exchange rate has held steady for six months the fiscal deficit 
narrowed 
the cost has been a deep recession however unemployment and 
underemployment at a combined rate of 18 percent is a record real 
wages have not kept up with inflation many families are hard 
pressed to make ends meet 
wage strikes and public protests about the pending sale of 
public firms like the airline and phone company are increasing 
teachers have boycotted public classrooms for a month 
political leaders openly worry about the prospect of social 
upheaval such as the food riots of may and june 1989 which killed 
16 people wounded more than 200 and resulted in nearly 2500 
arrests

in american eyes the united nations has come 
a long way since those days a generation ago when signs sprouted 
along the nations highways carrying a succinct message the us 
out of the un and the un out of the us 
that was a time when the un was a target of widespread 
ridicule seemingly incapable of doing much to keep the peace the 
image of the grimfaced soviet envoy casting veto after veto was a 
topic of many a political cartoon 
but the ability of washington and moscow to get along has 
breathed new life into the longbeleaguered world body which is 
coming off one of the best months of its 45year history 
without much fanfare the security council this week laid the 
groundwork for an end to the 11yearold civil war in cambodia 
such agreement had been impossible beforehand because three of the 
five security council members the united states the soviet union 
and china had been backing different factions in that conflict

the estimated 255 million who do travel could find other 
obstacles a nationwide traffic reporting service issued a list of 
highways that motorists might want to avoid and several states 
planned to use random checkpoints to nab drunken drivers 
the american automobile association expects a 2 percent decline 
in air train bus and car travel from last year partly due to 
rising gasoline prices following saddam husseins invasion of 
kuwait and partly due to an economic downturn that predates the 
middle east crisis

shunichi suzuki the governor of tokyo has the 
kind of power many heads of state would envy 
at his disposal are an army of 200000 municipal workers and an 
annual budget about equal to chinas or those of south korea and 
taiwan combined 
suzuki may not have the prestige of the prime minister but his 
post is an enticing one 
he is called governor not mayor because tokyo has special 
status as japans only to or metropolis suzuki a former high 
official in the national bureaucracy boasted to an interviewer 
that he helped obtain the designation 
in 11 years he has taken tokyo from the brink of bankruptcy to 
a surplus of 66 billion then suzuki started building a highrise 
city hall complex that will cost nearly 1 billion and his public 
soon became less adoring 
twentyfirst century tower of babel one headline screamed 
tax tower another complained 
suzuki was accused of plotting to turn city hall into a personal 
palace complete with marble bathtub and golden fixtures one 
report likened the conservative governor to nicolae ceausescu the 
ccommunist dictator of romania who was overthrown and executed last 
december 
the city hall complex nearing completion consists of two 
skyscrapers 48 and 34 stories high and a sevenstory metropolitan 
assembly building 
city officials once quick to note that the 795foot main 
building will be japans tallest now note with equal alacrity that 
the honor will not last long a building under construction in 
nearby yokohama will be slightly taller they say 
i just dont understand it suzuki said not many people 
realize this but no tax money is being used for building city 
hall its all coming from lottery profits and other sources 
whether the governor 79 runs for an unprecedented fourth term 
or not rumors are circulating that tokyo will have its first hotly 
contested governors race in decades suzukis term ends in april 
one month after the new city hall is scheduled to open 
he acknowledges the bad press has damaged his image a good 
deal of bad information has been published and you cant help it 
if thats what people end up believing he said in the interview 
until the city hall project came along even suzukis critics 
would have had difficulty finding evidence of extravagance 
by cutting 17000 people from the city payroll and reducing 
municipal pensions suzuki moved tokyo from a debt of 350 billion 
yen then 155 billion to the black in just three years after 
taking office in 1979 
suzuki avoided the question of whether he will seek a fourth 
term with the comment right now i have my hands full with my 
current responsibilities im certain he will run again and i 
think hell win said toshiya mita a conservative member of the 
metropolitan assembly theres just no one to replace him 
in his three election victories suzuki has had the support of 
three major conservative parties the liberal democrats komei 
clean government and democratic socialists 
that support is now said to be eroding and reports say the 
socialists japans largest opposition group are considering a run 
for the governorship by their popular leader takako doi 
mrs doi led her party to impressive election gains after 
bribery and other scandals last year that tainted leaders of the 
governing liberal democrats business and the bureaucracy 
nearly 12 million people live within tokyos city limits and 
greater tokyo has 30 million onefourth of japans population on 
2 percent of its land 
crime rates are low drug abuse is uncommon and there are few 
signs of the abject poverty that haunts many major cities in the 
united states and europe 
aside from extremely high land prices which have helped tokyo 
increase its fiscal surplus suzukis main declared battles have 
been against illegal parking and garbage 
the city has enough money to fight whatever battles it chooses 
this years budget is 44 billion onetenth of the national figure 
if waterworks and miscellaneous expenditures are included it 
would be about 66 billion about the same as the national budget 
of china suzuki said 
chinas budget for 1990 is roughly 70 billion dollars south 
koreas is 34 billion dollars and taiwan plans to spend 33 
billion 
despite suzukis reduction of the payroll the tokyo bureaucracy 
still is a huge machine 
more than 13000 city employees will move from more than a dozen 
old municipal buildings into the new city hall with more than 
3000 truckloads of paper

nothing she did the past 10 years basia says 
now prepared her to become an overnight sensation 
there was the obligatory dues paying the years of belting out 
jingles for commercials backing up other vocalists singing for 
top40 groups in the united states and england there was even her 
first album time and tide that seemed to grow slowly but 
surely on a worldwide audience 
but then came a second hit album londonwarsawnew york 
and a frenetic world tour that has turned everything upside down 
its been traumatic so far the polishborn pop singer 
whose full name is basia trzetrzelewska said with a giggle but 
its been a good kind of trauma the ebullient young woman confided 
and even a recent bout with a virus that forced her to cancel 
two shows on her summer us tour and left her normally languid 
voice slightly raspy couldnt dampen her spirits during a recent 
phone interview from chicago 
im enjoying this tour so much now she said we really 
have a good band for the first time every member of the group is 
exactly right everything just clicked this time 
it wasnt always that easy becoming an overnight sensation took 
a long time 
it started in the polish industrial city of jaworzno where 
basia grew up listening to western music everything from charlie 
parker to prince with pink floyd and carole king on the side 
she started singing with an allgirl group while still in her 
teens and left for london in 1981 to make a serious stab at a 
musical career her leaving she says allowed her to experience 
only from afar much of the economic and political turmoil her 
countrymen went through in the 1980s 
i left just before martial law got introduced she said in a 
voice that now contains a strong english accent 
before that my life in poland was pretty carefree and 
careless i remember that nothing really was missing in my life we 
had enough to eat we were comfortable my parents had their own 
business producing ice cream i had my music and my friends 
she incorporated everything she heard into her own upbeat style 
one thats heavy on jazz pop latin rhythms and american rhythm 
and blues 
and just after her arrival in london she met longtime 
collaborator danny white whose musical interests were equally 
broad by the mid1980s the two decided it was time to strike out 
on their own but that wasnt easy either 
danny kept encouraging me to write she said he would 
give me a verse and i had to finish the rest of the song it was 
something she hated 
to shut him up i finally just did it and we wrote a whole 
album that way 
the album was time and tide it was her first and quickly 
sold 100000 copies after its 1987 release the record company was 
delighted but she was disappointed because she was hoping for a 
gold record for 500000 copies sold but the lp just kept on 
selling going gold in 1988 and platinum for 1 million albums 
sold the following year 
then everything exploded londonwarsawnew york came out 
earlier this year and zoomed up the charts going gold in three 
weeks the small club dates from the last american tour quickly 
became huge concerthall events following this summers us tour 
there will be concerts in japan then its back to the united 
states in the fall for more shows 
the success has made her one of polands biggest stars 
now when i tell my mum something shes already seen it in 
the interview she quipped 
but her mother hasnt seen her perform in front of thousands 
yet shes only seen her daughters videos so there will soon be a 
series of concerts in poland too 
this is something that is very much on my mind its important 
to me basia said family also is important and she returns home 
several times a year when im there i get so sentimental and 
soppy that i just want to cry 
in fact if success has a downside it is that it has kept her 
from starting her own family 
this is something i miss the most she said i envy people 
who have a stable family life career its one thing but its 
nothing compared to that i really want it badly and sometimes im 
afraid i wont get it i didnt meet the right person yet im 
afraid 
but im still keeping my eyes open she adds turning upbeat 
again

routine is james micheners secret but the 
results are hardly routine 
despite quintuple bypass heart surgery a new left hip 
extensive dental work and an attack of permanent vertigo the 
pulitzer prizewinning novelist still produces massive tomes at the 
age of 83 10 books altogether in the last four years 
his fans in awe of his output wonder how he does it with the 
september publication of his latest work theyll find out 
in a lengthy prologue to the eagle and the raven michener 
says the work may appear to be an almost indecent display of 
frenzied industry but it was carried out slowly carefully each 
morning at the typewriter each afternoon filled with exciting 
research and reflection 
light exercise and diet a nap and classical music are part of 
each day for this prolific writer who says he could not possibly 
remain idle 
i have had a burst of energy i could never have anticipated 
not only to write more books but particularly to leave a picture of 
a professional writer at work michener said 
michener divides his time among austin where he teaches writing 
at the university of texas st petersburg fla and brunswick 
maine 
deborah brothers coowner of state house press of austin which 
is publishing the book said the prologue answers many questions 
reader ask about micheners life 
curiously during this spurt of energy i have never thought of 
myself as either compulsive or driven nor was i michener said 
through decades of writing i have acquired certain patterns of 
behavior and workmanship which had enabled me to write long books 
i merely adhere to those solid rules i rise each day at 730 
wash my face in cold water but do not shave eat a frugal breakfast 
of bran sprinkled with banana raisins and skim milk no sugar and 
go directly to my desk where the days work has been laid out the 
night before 
with delight and a feeling of wellbeing i leap into whatever 
task awaits and remain at it until half after noon when i have a 
light lunch after which i take a nap i never type in the afternoon 
but do meet classes at the university 
at dusk each day regardless of the weather i take a mile 
walk at a rather brisk clip supper the evening news a nine 
oclock movie if a good one is available on television a halfhour 
of cleaning my desk at 11 and off to bed 
also he said each day without fail i find time to listen to 
classical music on my new compact disc player including chopin 
beethoven liszt schubert brahms bartok stravinsky and operatic 
arias 
i never play the music while i work at original composition 
but often listen to it when doing routine work like checking 
pagination reading stacks of accumulated mail or filing research 
material the long walks the sensible diet and the music keep me 
healthy and able to complete the work michener said 
one nagging question remains was i apprehensive of 
workending death and did i labor so diligently because of 
my age and the approach of a time when i could work no more 
i think not i write at 83 for the same reasons that impelled 
me to write at 43 i was born with a passionate desire to 
communicate to organize experience to tell tales that dramatize 
the adventures which listeners might have had michener said 
the job of a storyteller is to tell stories and i have 
concentrated on that obligation 
the storytelling in the eagle and the raven comes in a 
modified expanded version of a lengthy chapter pulled from 
texas published in 1986 
it follows the lives of generals santa anna of mexico and sam 
houston of texas their brief encounter in 1836 at the battle of 
san jacinto which enabled texas to win its independence from 
mexico is considered by many historians to be one of the decisive 
battles of the world

last images of the shipwreck 
suffered the usual fate of a good argentine movie 
it won best script best actress and best movie honors at film 
festivals in montreal havana and biarritz last year at home 
about 50000 argentines paid to see it 
im proud of it but economically it was a disaster 
director elisio subiela said 
many recent argentine films have been marked by high praise and 
empty seats the official story was ignored by moviegoers until 
it won the academy award for best foreign film in 1985 and was 
rereleased 
several years ago last images of the shipwreck might have 
been considered a success because of the international prizes 
today it is viewed as a failure because of the box office 
argentinas movie industry is changing priorities and themes in 
part because it is on the verge of collapse state support has 
dried up movie fans watch more at home on video and cable tv and 
local productions have to search overseas for financing 
the industry is living through a crisis that has structural 
overtones said octavio getino director of the national 
institute of cinematography 
overall attendance dropped to 25 million last year from 64 
million in 1984 nearly four of every 10 theaters opened five years 
ago have shut down 
the decline in attendance at argentine films was even steeper 
to 12 million from 116 million in 1987 five of the top 
10grossing films were argentine last year there were only two 
as few as seven local films will be made this year compared to 
about 40 in 1986 only successful directors can line up financing 
much of which comes from europe and the united states many actors 
now work abroad 
the downturn has been sudden even considering the topsyturvy 
industry whose fortunes reflect four decades of political coups and 
economic instability 
in the 1940s and early 50s buenos aires was a sort of 
hollywood south five production companies churned out dozens of 
films a year mostly lowbrow comedies that were hits up and down 
the continent 
the 1980s in contrast saw serious films with political and 
social messages honored at cannes and screened in new york and los 
angeles developments that rarely happened before 
the 197683 military dictatorship which censured 727 films 
provided rich material for moviemakers the dirty war on 
leftist subversion was the backdrop for the official story the 
spurious and futile falkland islands war with britain was the theme 
of the internal debt 
those and other argentine films were angry shouts about events 
that for years a prudent person would whisper only to a friend 
they upheld values that helped argentines cope with innocent lives 
brutally torn apart and to repair the countrys international 
image 
getino suggests the time has come for directors to move on to 
other perhaps less somber ideas im convinced that if a 
movie interests people theyll pay to see it he said our 
directors have to find what that is 
directors are searching 
last images of the shipwreck is an offbeat love story about 
a wouldbe novelist who saves a woman he believes is about to throw 
herself in the path of a train as they get to know each other she 
inspires him to write 
director eduardo mignona is putting the finishing touches on 
flop the argentine marksman the movie is based on the life of 
florencio parravicini a turnofthecentury stage actor whose 
specialty was shooting bullets through bottles without breaking 
them 
maria luisa bembergs film i the worst of all premiered 
this summer it is about juan ines de la cruz a nun who battled 
sexual stereotypes in 17thcentury mexico and today is acclaimed as 
one of the greatest poets of spains golden age 
i thought that through her i could tell a story about 
the fight of a free spirit to express herself bemberg said 
juana was an advanced spirit absolutely contemporary 
in the way she saw the world 
bembergs 1984 historical film camila was a rare artistic 
and commercial success it was nominated for the best foreign film 
oscar and drew 2 million people to the theater 
making movies in argentina has never been easy director carlos 
sorin underscored that point in the kings movie a whimsical 
1985 film about a 19thcentury adventurer who briefly ruled the 
araucanian indians in southern patagonia 
as filming drags on funds run out and the cast quits the 
director ever resourceful finally dresses up as the hero and 
rides through an army of mannequins who take the place of indians 
in the closing scene he brainstorms his next project 
as fewer local movies are made and producers are forced to seek 
funds abroad directors wonder who will put argentinas ideas 
music scenery and people on film if argentines cannot 
subiela who is vice president of the argentina film directors 
association argues there is only one way out more state funding 
that seems unlikely in the short run the government of president 
carlos menem is faced with budget deficits inflation and recession 
the national institute of cinematography budget in 1985 was 11 
million so far this year it has received 200000

two romanian expatriates are trying to 
help cool passions that linger after the revolution by teaching 
western journalism to reporters who never had to distinguish fact 
from fiction 
under nicolae ceausescu communist authorities replaced the 
journalism department at bucharest university with an 
indoctrination course for party officials to make sure the 
propaganda machine ran smoothly 
the result even after the dictator was overthrown and executed 
in december is a polarized press that often inflames the public 
what passes for news is a onesided mix of opinion sprinkled 
with a few facts progovernment and opposition papers are equally 
guilty 
government spokesmen claim the opposition shames romania the 
independent daily romania libera began a recent response so we 
dont want the good of the country 
a new fivepart journalism course being given at the league of 
human rights headquarters in bucharest is the brainchild of 
expatriate gabriel nicolescou an architect who founded the 
romanian freedom forum in chicago and publishes a romanianenglish 
monthly called democratic romania 
his partner 28yearold michael maldarescu finances the course 
from profits generated by his new telephone news line in chicago 
called inside romania 
irish journalist sean hillen one of the several foreign 
teachers said his 140 students still have trouble distinguishing 
between fact and opinion 
its difficult to get them to understand that their opinions 
are irrelevant to objective reporting he said but they are 
enthusiastic about journalism and learning about the world 
outside 
his students some of whom worked in the statecontrolled media 
under ceausescu recognize the problems 
events in romania caused the reporting to be out of passion 
and journalists took sides said mariana trifian 27 the 
course will help eliminate that i feel now that i will be able to 
control myself it would be better for the people to read 
objective reporting 
hennelise koch 26 said readers raised on the old journalism 
are part of the problem she said they need to be taught to read 
an objective newspaper and not be looking for political 
allegiances 
maldarescu the money man said the course tries to teach 
potential journalists here what western journalism is all about 
so they see why it is that if you took any article that appeared 
in a romanian paper and tried to publish it in the west it just 
wouldnt work 
hillen said students are taught everything from layout to 
writing leads and headlines and how to conduct interviews for 
various media 
a recent class posed this problem 
if you had a sixhour deadline to write an article about 
adoption and you knew absolutely nothing about the subject what 
would you do 
the guest lecturer was catherine adams a reporter for 
independent radio network and united press international 
maldarescu said the course is accredited by the romanian 
government and he is working on a plan for making it an associate 
degree program recognized by us universities 
he said he hopes the school and his telephone news line 
especially its financial service will enable a flow of 
information from here to there and the other way around so that 
romanians begin to understand a little better the concept of a free 
market and society and we begin to understand the situation in 
romania

leaders from southern sudan have come 
together for the first time to seek ways of ending the civil war 
that has ravaged their region for seven years 
in the forefront is retired gen joseph lagu a southerner who 
fought the government for 17 years and now is its chief un 
delegate many southerners hold lagu largely responsible for the 
process that led to the current war 
we have to appeal to both the government and those in the bush 
for a ceasefire he told a rally of southerners held to 
inaugurate the peace effort we must talk both to our people in 
government and the rebel areas 
hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians have been killed 
or died of famine and most experts feel neither side can win 
several national and international mediation efforts have 
failed the latest was a shortlived us attempt declared dead in 
august by col mohammed alamin alkhalifa the government 
representative in negotiations with the rebels 
this is the first attempt at a solution by southerners whose 
lives have been scarred by intermittent war and famine since sudan 
became independent of britain and egypt in 1956 
at the heart of the current and past wars are the religious and 
racial conflicts between the moslem arabs of the north who control 
the government and the black christians and aminists of the south 
more than 100 politicians from the south an area the size of 
texas are involved in the current search for peace many were 
political prisoners until their release this summer 
brig pio yukuwan deng the chief organizer is one of three 
southerners in the 15member military junta that has ruled sudan 
since june 30 1989 
deng a christian who served with lagus rebels in the 1960s 
told the rally we must have our say in the peacemaking in this 
country without southerners coming together peace cannot be 
realized in sudan 
southerners never have united even in the cause of secession 
for 17 years lagu led the anyanya movement whose main support 
came from relatively minor tribes in the huge equatoria region the 
organizations name denotes the poison of the gabon viper 
nearly all the rebels of the current sudan peoples liberation 
army are dinka the souths main tribe based in the nile river 
provinces dinka neither trust nor are trusted by the equatorians 
lagu came to terms in 1972 with president gaafar nimeiri who 
was overthrown in 1985 and joined the army in the name of national 
reconciliation 
southern sudanese believe the current war is rooted in the 
discovery of oil in the south in the early 1980s 
they say the discovery prompted nimeiri to renege on commitments 
he made in the 1972 peace agreement and divide the autonomous south 
into three weak regions 
that was accomplished by having lagu instigate the small tribes 
against the dinka in the turmoil that resulted nimeiri decreed 
the partition 
col john garang a ustrained southerner mutinied in the 
garrison town of bor 650 miles south of khartoum the capital 
formed a rebel army and went into the bush 
garang demands more say in government for the south and a larger 
share of the nations resources for the region 
at the rally lagu asked forgiveness he told the crowd he had 
helped destroy southern influence and spawned garangs rebellion 
because i wanted to reduce the domination of small tribes by the 
big tribes 
sira nay a southern political activist at the rally said the 
problem was as much politics as tribalism 
only the military can bring peace to this country he said 
they dont have the constraints of the political parties who 
have their own axes to grind 
nay pointed out that the military ended lagus rebellion in 
1972 three years after nimeiri seized power in a coup and he 
declared now we will wait and see if this government can repeat 
history 
the junta led by lt gen omar hassan elbashir has said 
ending the war is a prime objective but has done little to achieve 
it

kasey rose the only woman at the us 
forest services north cascades smokejumper base is either 
parachuting to a forest fire or practicing to do just that 
the 22yearold collegiate rower and premed student said she 
ventured into the intensely male field for the physical challenge 
the excitement and the chance to make 10000 during the summer 
i want to prove to myself that i can do this she said 
you make good money and you get to stay in shape thats real 
important for rowing 
it has been 50 years since the first smokejumpers leaped from 
airplanes to snuff small wildfires before they turned into big 
ones the elite strike force now has 400 members but only about 
seven women 
ms rose in her second year of smokekjumping has 22 jumps to 
her credit 
at 5foot11 and 150 pounds and as captain of a national 
champion rowing team at the university of washington last year she 
has the physical tools for the job but she said one of the biggest 
challenges is to win acceptance from the men 
jumpers work in teams of two and should one be injured the 
other has to be capable of carrying the partner to safety 
ms rose is not quite as strong or as fast as many of the men 
she can do just 12 chinups while many of the men can do 15 and 
her time in the mile run often is slower 
but just to qualify for training a person must do seven 
chinups 25 pushups 45 situps and run a mile and a half in 
under 11 minutes ms rose noted 
i can keep up on the job she said but ive heard them 
say its the last male frontier

tonight in the start of an unusual endurance 
test cables lifetime network is premiering a onehour 
mondaythroughfriday drama series called eng 
the initials stand for for electronic newsgathering here it is 
the kind committed in local tv news cbs also is covering the same 
tube turf next month in its new wiou series but only on 
wednesdays 
with a new episode arriving each evening for at least 44 nights 
the canadianmade eng may accelerate what is known as 
newsblur 
newsblur comes from watching too much tv news or shows about tv 
news shows pretty soon your mind goes poof and you start thinking 
that saddam hussein is an anchorman wholl do anything for ratings 
but eng does have more than saddam hussein it has a 
lovely acting news director who wants the job full time she is 
having a furtive affair with a handsome tom cruiseedition 
cameraman he is divorced with two kids 
there also is a pretty camerawoman who also fools around shes 
just getting over mononucleosis and those in charge order gamma 
globulin shots for everyone in the newsroom 
moving right along now the station manager is a sinister 
pecksniff he always secondguesses the newsies and is ready to 
cave in to the mayor and sponsors at a nanoseconds notice 
there is a blonde reporter who always wants to do the lead 
story and a handsome twit reporter in a pressed trenchcoat and 
a dense fatuous anchorman and a wise cynical old assignment 
editor 
and yes the new news director who comes in is hardnosed and 
dedicated to the truth handsome and single he has a trenchcoat 
too 
add a hostage crisis at a local grocery store a shooting of a 
hostage that the cameraman gets on tape before he also is taken 
hostage and viola for the rest of the show you get a lot of 
voila 
fortunately all this developed in the twohour pilot of the 
series that was cablecast saturday night if you stepped out for a 
beer then you may want to count your blessings even though youre 
no good at fractions 
funny thing is though this filmandtape saga made in 
toronto actually has a good cast particularly with sara botsford 
as the wannabe news chief art hindle as the guy who gets the job 
and mark humphrey as the dashing cameraman 
but in the tradition of most tv series about tv news saturdays 
script by bryce zabel and brad markowitz left no newsroom cliche 
unturned it ran the gamut from ethics to cynicism to deepdown 
commitment to journalism 
it emphasized the last so often one was kind of disappointed 
there wasnt a station where the announcer said journalism 
erupts in newsroom film at 11 
there also was some truly awful dialogue and a muddled plot 
about the towns mayor trying to keep a visiting worlds fair site 
selection committee from learning about the grocery store hostage 
crisis on live tv 
this was because the rotten holdup man demanded to go on live tv 
and negotiate his way out of hard time in jail nix said the 
hardnosed news director even though the cameramanhostage from 
his station faced death 
if we let them on the air every lunatic in this city is going 
to grab a gun and try to get on tv 
but the medium may be losing its impact 
example earlier in the show the twit reporter loses his cool 
when he gets roughed up by a cop even though he identifies himself 
as from newsblur 10 or whatever his program is cries the reporter 
dont you guys watch tv 
er not at this rate 
unless the writing gets oh maybe a quantum leap better 
eng will next be heard from as a 44episode pileup whose 
demise gets only 10 seconds on the evening news over at wiou

ok class listen up if its labor day week it 
must be time for those annual television marathons on what ails 
public education 
happily cbs and public broadcasting are serving up two 
unusually engaging and informative backtoschool specials 
leading off is learning in america schools that work a 
twohour pbs offering appearing 911 pm edt wednesday sept 5 
reporter roger mudd guides us through four elementary schools that 
have defied odds and become special places that put kids first 
its a refreshing break for viewers awash in bad news about us 
schools 
the program shows classroom life in northview school a 
workingclass school in manhattan kan columbia park elementary 
school in landover md where 95 percent of students are black 
city magnet school a unique multiethnic school in lowell mass 
with studentrun banks courts and other features of a democratic 
freemarket society and lozano special emphasis school 98 percent 
hispanic where a toughminded principal has virtually eliminated 
absenteeism and boosted test scores 
city magnet is especially interesting a model of learning by 
doing for one period a day kids put aside their other academic 
chores and hold jobs in a mock democratic society that imitates 
real life students pay taxes hold jobs and sell goods and 
services a girl who hits another gets hauled before a studentrun 
court and gets a stiff fine 
most of all says one parent the school has heart a lot of 
heart 
mudd concludes by summarizing what makes all four schools 
excellent a devoted belief in the value of public education 
collegiality among teachers independence from school district 
bureaucrats and above all a commitment to the children 
themselves a respect for their selfesteem and the ability of each 
to learn 
by focusing on peaceful carefree elementary schools the pbs 
special exudes a feelgood air that would be far less plausible if 
the cameras were aimed at high schools 
and mudd dismisses perhaps too lightly the role of money in 
school reform 
still the pbs special succeeds admirably in showing why these 
schools work while so many others fail mudd handles the assignment 
with a deft unobtrusive touch wisely letting the pictures and 
action speak for themselves while keeping the focus clear with 
wellchosen commentary 
quite different and even more ambitious is cbss twohour 
offering americas toughest assignment solving the education 
crisis airing at 911 pm edt thursday anchored by the wise 
and civilized charles kuralt the program provides a sort of cliff 
notes condensation of volumes of school research and thinking 
produced during the last decade of school reform 
thursdays special is the centerpiece of cbss project 
education taking place sept 27 there will be education 
segments on cbss sunday morning 60 minutes and on the 
evening news with dan rather 
the network also is hosting an allday education conference at 
georgetown university on wednesday featuring several governors 
business spokesmen and prominent educators 
along with kuralt the special features virtually every news 
star in the cbs firmament except dan rather along with several 
governors and many of the nations leading education spokesmen 
it was shot in 34 locations across the country the camera 
doesnt pause for long on any classroom scene 
among the better moments in this manyfaceted special has white 
house correspondent leslie stahl examining what it will take to 
attract better teachers she goads an uncharacteristically reticent 
teacher union leader albert shanker into a peppery exchange in 
which she keeps repeating money money money 
60 minutes correspondent mike wallace tackles ably the 
complicated and politically explosive topic of school finance 
interviewing the governors of texas kentucky and new jersey where 
the issue is currently hottest 
ed bradley of 60 minutes hosts the strongest part of the 
program a fascinating look at how poor parents in arkansas are 
being trained to be their childrens first teachers 
sprinkled throughout the broadcast are nine proposals to improve 
american education from smaller schools and treating teachers as 
professionals to better prenatal and preschool care 
though cbs presents them as their own such ideas are hardly 
new reformers have been yelling themselves blue for the past 
decade trying to get the public to listen to these ideas 
unlike mudd kuralt fails to recap his shows many proposals and 
themes at the end of the show 
still who knows maybe theyll finally sink in now that kuralt 
has bestowed his homespun endorsement

frank dunlop runs the worlds biggest 
arts festival in edinburgh on a budget this year of 35 million 
pounds 66 million and expects to balance the books 
barbara neville a computer systems analyst from london brings 
her talents as a storyteller to the threeweek festival at a cost 
of 1500 pounds 2850 from her own pocket 
this year dunlop has rudolf nureyev the bolshoi opera the san 
francisco symphony orchestra and paintings by paul cezanne but 
some critics still complain there arent enough big names 
this is not a festival for betsy bloomingdale diamonds and a 
different dress every night with a house in the alps outside 
salzburg dunlop said in an interview the festival is for 
everyone and our tickets are the cheapest if we went for just big 
names we could find ourselves spending 100000 pounds 190000 on 
three days of rehearsals for one orchestra 
the prestige of appearing at the festival encourages some 
governments to subsidize visits by their arts companies 
we couldnt do the program without that support dunlop 
readily acknowledged 
taxpayers commercial sponsors and the box office make up his 
budget 
dunlop a professional stage director who worked in london and 
new york and founded the young vic has done extraordinary things 
for six years he has had stunning successes with japanese theater 
companies performing in their own language 
people these days have been to hong kong and around the world 
and become incredibly curious about things happening outside 
europe dunlop said 
its easier to see a play in a language utterly unknown to you 
like japanese than one in which you might know a few words like 
german 
i do it for the love of it said neville who at 44 is the 
same age as the festival i came in 1984 as a visitor for the 
first time and it caught me completely so much that i wanted to do 
something 
as a performer on the festival fringe which runs in tandem with 
dunlops official arts festival neville sits on a high stool in a 
church hall and tells stories from the arabian nights grimms 
fairy tales jewish folk tales from eastern europe and japanese 
stories 
if i get a 50 percent capacity audience i will have covered my 
costs she said 
she will be lucky its nothing unusual for a company of 
halfadozen performers on the fringe to have an audience of less 
or even no audience at all 
but still the performers come sleeping on the floors of crowded 
apartments and playing in schoolrooms churches and pubs and 
paying their own way including rent for venues 
the fringe is a phenomenon said administrator mhairi 
mackenzierobinson who oversees this years presentation of 9800 
performances of 1100 different shows by 537 companies 128 of them 
from overseas 
few have come farther than the 24 members of the kumu kahua 
theater company from honolulu with two hawaiian history plays 
most of them had never been to europe before and the 10 women in 
the company broke into song when they got off the plane 
it cost us a fortune to come said wayne kischer a board 
member 
sponsors provided much of the cash for the 11000mile journey 
via los angeles and new york artistic director gene shofner 
estimated the cost at between 100000 and 150000 
shofner who grew up in san diego calif said i came to the 
fringe for the first time in 1988 and as soon as i got here and saw 
it i was sure we should come i saw some of the best theater ive 
ever seen and some of the worst 
we came to share our art because we think we are unique 
broadway and the west end of london are for big bucks 
dale goodson a freelance writer with the gusto house cabaret 
quartet from new york city said weve known about the fringe 
for years and theres nothing comparable back home we came to make 
contacts and encourage people to come to new york 
we dug very deep in our pockets to come you cant make money 
on the fringe but we want to put on a good show

merriment is in scant supply for wall streets 
observance of the traditional business new year at labor day 
1990 
as investors and their brokers return in full force from 
vacations or other summer diversions a long agenda of economic and 
financial worries faces the securities markets 
talk abounds that investors in stocks may be in for a bear 
market of unknown severity and duration in the producing and 
consuming economy many analysts worry that a recession looms if 
indeed one hasnt already begun 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait cast a monthlong shadow over 
the worlds markets driving the dow jones industrial average down 
to its lowest level in more than a year 
last week hopes began to spread that an orderly resolution to 
the crisis could be reached the price of oil recently as high as 
32 a barrel fell back into the mid20s 
but even given relief from those tensions analysts say the 
economy and the markets will have a lot of problems to contend with 
forget the middle east mess for a moment and recall where we 
stood a few weeks ago before iraq struck declared martin zweig 
in his stock advisory letter the zweig forecast 
at midyear zweig observed the average stock already showed a 
doubledigit loss from its 1989 highs even as a few blue chips had 
pushed the dow jones industrial average to new highs 
stock after stock was getting smashed because of overly 
optimistic analysts forecasts and an overvalued market he said 
for many months the economy had been showing numerous signs 
that the jig was up and that recession was a high probability 
interest rates abroad were surging while the dollar was 
collapsing the budget deficit had soared 
the banking system was refusing loans to marginal borrowers as 
the banks themselves were hit with credit downgrades and bad loans 
real estate prices were heading south some environment huh 
the oil jolt was akin to throwing gasoline on a smoldering 
fire 
normally most of the calls for help to put out that fire would 
be directed to the federal reserve 
now however many observers are not sure the fed has the means 
at its disposal to bring about the necessary reduction in interest 
rates 
a conventional easing of monetary policy might not achieve that 
mission analysts say if it exacerbates inflationary fears 
prompted by the summer surge in oil prices 
still some observers argue that the timing of the crisis in the 
middle east might not have been quite as bad for the domestic 
economy as it looked at first 
they argue that the damage might prove to be less in an economy 
that was already weakening than it could have been in the setting 
of a boom 
inflation psychology was largely absent said robert 
barbera economist at shearson lehman brothers inc manufacturing 
companies had been paring both inventories and employees and 
services sector job growth had slowed appreciably 
given both limited real economy excesses and modest inflation 
pressures prior to the iraq invasion the effect of the rise in oil 
prices on core inflation will be limited barbera maintained 
similarly the absence of any large inventory overhang in the 
factory sector will temper the impact of a shortfall in demand 
the economy will contract less because it was already being 
squeezed

after surviving a decade of civil war 
nicaraguans face inflation of 80 percent a month and threetiered 
pricing that turns a shopping trip into an exercise for number 
crunchers 
many people tuck a calculator into purse or pocket before 
leaving home 
i have to think twice before going out to buy anything said 
susana montenegro a middleclass housewife encountered in a 
supermarket and not just because everything is so expensive 
its the conversions back and forth they give me a headache 
a new currency called the gold cordoba and the rules governing 
its value have made a confusing economy even more so 
gold cordobas officially trade at par with the dollar and are 
supposed to replace the old cordobas which nicaraguans have 
christened chancheros or piggies to set them apart from 
the new ones 
when mrs montenegro buys a 5pound bag of beans she can pay in 
either gold cordobas or dollars and get change in piggies at the 
official exchange rate or she can pay the entire amount in piggies 
into her decision and calculations she must factor the 
principle that a piggy in hand should be a piggy spent quickly 
because it will buy less next week 
devaluations of the piggy which occur each monday make last 
weeks black market rate this weeks official exchange rate 
erasing what advantage there had been in trading with the 
coyotes who deal in currency in response the coyotes change 
their own rate 
francisco mayorga president of the central bank hailed the 
gold cordoba as the cornerstone of the economic revival promised by 
the new government but it has been a mild flop 
only 4 million worth have been released into the market since 
the gold cordobas debut aug 13 about 5 percent of the total 
money in circulation and much of that is back in the bank vaults 
few people use the gold cordoba suspicious consumers prefer 
dollars or even piggies although 900000 of them were needed to 
buy a dollar at the end of august 
the government says it will issue only as many gold cordobas as 
it has dollars to back them up 
official parity remains in effect but real parity began 
dissolving when the government stores that sell foreign goods only 
for dollars added a 1 percent charge for anyone paying with gold 
cordobas 
coyotes wont touch the new currency 
most people who buy dollars from me are merchants who go to 
honduras and guatemala to buy and the gold cordobas are not 
accepted over there said one who would not give his name the 
dollar is the dollar anywhere the gold cordoba is something that 
only panchito mayorga likes 
public employees who received 50 gold cordobas each as part of 
their pay can use them to pay utility bills which are higher now 
that subsidies have been ended 
restaurants supermarkets and other businesses have converted 
prices to gold cordobas but accept piggies at the official rate 
and dollars 
to cope with the rising cost of living people usually change 
their gold cordobas at banks for dollars and trade the dollars for 
piggies with streetcorner coyotes who pay about 10 percent above 
the official rate 
mrs montenegro tries to keep up with exchange rates because 
there have been 40 devaluations this year 33 of them under 
president violeta chamorros government since it succeeded the 
sandinistas four months ago 
if she receives dollars from relatives in the united states as 
many nicaraguans do she is better off changing them on the black 
market and paying bills in piggies 
many nicaraguans feel the higher rate on the black market 
offsets the risk of a police raid during the transaction

endangered species pop up in the strangest 
places like flowerbeds 
plantprotection activists say some species of bulbs bought to 
decorate american and european gardens are being collected by the 
millions in the wild threatening to wipe out those flowers in 
their home turf 
the world would lose an irreplaceable treasure said 
marjorie arundel of warrenton va an adviser to the garden club 
of americas horticulture committee theyre the ancestors of all 
of our spring bulbs today 
mrs arundel and other activists are urging american gardeners 
to buy only commercially propagated plants which experts say make 
up at least 99 percent of the flower trade anyway 
wildcollected flowers are a small percentage of the trade 
but a large percentage of certain kinds of plants said faith 
campbell director of the plant conservation program for the 
natural resources defense council an environmental group 
working with the world wildlife fund and the garden club of 
america the nrdc has produced leaflets calling on gardeners to 
avoid most kinds of cyclamen sternbergia and galanthus or 
snowdrops which they say are collected in the wild in turkey 
those three species are listed as endangered in the convention 
on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and 
flora or cites but this treaty effective in fighting trade in 
some endangered animal skins horns and tusks has had little 
effect on the flower trade ms campbell said 
snowdrops are greatly depleted in turkeys mediterranean 
regions forcing traders to seek out sources in more remote regions 
the popular angels tears narcissus are being collected in 
the wild but experts are not sure if the source is portugal or 
somewhere else 
other wildflowers such as trillium are being collected from 
the wild in the united states and canada japan china india and 
the soviet union appear to be the sources for still other rare 
flowers 
some species of these plants may be produced by growers in the 
united states or europe but buyers are being counseled to check 
the origins as carefully as they can 
this may become easier as a result of the decision last may by 
the dutch commodity board for ornamental horticultural products to 
require exporters to use a bulbs from wild sources label to 
identify wildcollected plants 
under the negotiated agreement dutch exporters will also label 
their cultivated bulbs beginning in 1992 for minor species and in 
1995 for such major bulb varieties as tulips and hyacinths 
because the netherlands has long dominated the world flower 
trade the action by the dutch regulatory body should have a major 
impact ms campbell said it is not binding though on dealers in 
the united states or other countries 
also the agreement was reached too late for most of this falls 
catalogs so even if american gardeners order from dutch dealers 
covered by the rules they might not know they were buying 
wildcollected flowers until the bulbs arrive in the mail labeled 
wild sources 
we can just hope they wont order those again ms campbell 
said it is a messy phasingin 
the longrange solution she said could be in helping people in 
turkey and elsewhere who make money from collecting wild flowers to 
start propagating the rare flowers in or near the native habitat 
she said 
gardeners shouldnt think theyre aiding nature by keeping alive 
a species that might be disappearing in its native habitat 
we dont consider that a contribution to conservation in any 
way ms campbell said its not playing its role in the 
ecosystem in which it evolved

wrangel island is 2800 square miles of 
freezing windswept tundra off the siberian coast soviets have 
been camped there for six decades but carl olson calls it 100 
percent american 
and the same goes for four other islands flung across hundreds 
of miles of ocean at the edge of the polar icecap 
theres no question that the five islands belong to alaska 
declares olson a crusading los angeles teacher 
olson wants the government to reassert american claims abandoned 
66 years ago if they ever existed the state department says this 
country has never claimed ostrov vrangelya as its current 
occupants call it 
the ussoviet maritime boundary treaty signed in june places 
wrangel and the four other islands squarely in the soviet 
economicinterest area 
the alaska legislature however has approved resolutions saying 
wrangel should be part of the state and calling for state 
representation in any negotiations on future ownership 
wrangel is 83 miles across the long strait from siberia 200 
miles from the alaskan mainland bennett island the farthest out 
of the four others is about 800 miles from alaska 
the others are herald henrietta and jeannette 
july temperatures on wrangel soar to a high of 36 degrees 
fahrenheit and the mean reading for february is 13 below 
a recent estimate put wrangel islands human population at 50 a 
colony of eskimos and chukchis transplanted from the siberian 
mainland was established by the soviets in 1926 
walruses seals and polar bears and herds of lemmings live 
there too and olson recalls an old flickering documentary film 
showing reindeer prancing in the frozen mists 
one of the prime attractions of wrangel and the shallow seas 
around it however has been the unproven belief that vast oil 
reserves lie beneath the island and the icy waters off northeast 
siberia 
looking beneath the surface of the arctic waters gives us 
another vital reason not to give up the area to the soviets says 
olson oil and gas literally billions of barrels 
olson has created an organization state department watch to 
press the case for making wrangel and the four other islands part 
of the united states 
appeals from olson a former executive director of the 
washingtonbased conservative caucus inc have created ripples on 
capitol hill although not lately rep william dannemeyer 
rcalif offered legislation that would bar signing away the 
island without submitting such a treaty to the senate 
but the bill has been stuck in committee for two years and 
despite a new sponsor rep dan burton rind appears headed for 
oblivion a similar measure was introduced in the senate last year 
by sen jesse helms rnc 
conservatives however are not promising to make a fight of it 
we cant fight every battle says conservative caucus leader 
howard phillips we try to fight battles where it can make a 
difference 
he says wrangel and the waters around it could not only yield a 
petroleum bonanza but prove militarily vital 
tales of a large island off northeast siberia circulated in 
russia as early as the 18th century and fired the imagination of 
explorer frederick petrovich von wrangel he searched in 1824 but 
apparently never found it 
its barren shores may first have been sighted by captain henry 
kellett of then royal navy in 1849 after he discovered herald 
island 
but an american skipper captain thomas long is often credited 
for discovering wrangel on a voyage of the barque nile in 1867 
the us revenue marine steamer corwin under captain calvin l 
hooper visited wrangel in 1881 among those who went ashore was the 
explorer john muir whose book the cruise of the corwin told of 
the expedition 
wrangel and four other islands that amount to pinpoints in the 
arctic ocean were visited in 1881 by navy commander george 
washington de long aboard the vessel jeannette and surveyed for the 
united states coast and geodetic survey 
the survey placed all five islands in the district of alaska as 
did the united states geological survey starting in 1900 
but the island remained unoccupied until 1914 when survivors of 
an expedition led by vilhjalmar steffanson lived there for six 
months ten years later the soviets staked their claim and it was 
not disputed by the united states britain or canada

all week rumors swirled on wall street that 
federal regulators might take over the troubled bank of new 
england all week regulators denied they were true 
but when a congressional candidate thursday flatly stated that 
the government had recommended liquidating the institution the 
rumors gained new weight dragging down bank of new englands stock 
price 
the episode demonstrated how rumors can move the nations 
financial markets and how like a game of telephone rumors can 
change enough to threaten a companys stability 
the problem is that irresponsiblity like this press release 
can kill a bank said ellen stockdale a spokeswoman for the 
comptroller of the currency in washington which regulates 
federally chartered banks 
democratic congressional hopeful ted dimauro issued a news 
release based on rampant rumors the bank would be seized by federal 
regulators dimauro learned of the rumors from a financial wire 
service report 
dimauro wanted to take a shot at his opponent rep richard 
neal dmass a member of the house banking committee whom he 
accused of ignorance about the bank but he got the facts wrong 
this is a sad day for massachusetts as the fdic has 
recommended the liquidation of bank of new england a statement 
from dimauro said the federal deposit insurance corp recommended 
nothing of the sort 
dimauro later apologized saying his statement should have noted 
the wire service report concerned speculation that shouldnt have 
been presented as fact he blamed an aide for releasing the 
statement without his approval 
too late the bank and federal regulators had to scramble to 
shore up the banks reputation saying it was solvent and denying 
that a takeover was pending 
already fighting to recover from new englands depressed real 
estate market that left it holding millions of dollars in bad 
loans the banks stock plummeted 385 percent to 1 a share from 
162 in new york stock exchange trading thursday 
the banks chairman and chief executive lawrence k fish said 
the surprising and harmful rumors that have been circulating 
about bank of new england during the last several days are 
completely untrue 
the facts are that we have been fully liquid since 
midjune operating expenses have been sharply reduced and our 
plans for a recapitalization are well advanced fish said in a 
statement our recovery program is on track 
bank of new england has operated under federal orders since 
early this year the bank came under heightened government scrutiny 
when a downturn in the economy and the real estate market exposed 
mountains of bad loans 
the bank lost close to 80 million in the first half of 1990 on 
top of more than 1 billion in losses last year under an operating 
plan with federal regulators bank of new england plans to sell off 
assets and slash its work force to reduce costs and raise money 
against that backdrop rumors have circulated occasionally about 
the banks future analysts said such speculation typically 
increases before a long holiday weekend 
the rumors in this case were so persistent they were likely to 
have an impact on the banks stock said don kauth an analyst with 
first albany corp 
its been a distressed bank for some time and the continued 
deterioration in economic fundamentals in new england made their 
recovery that much more difficult he said 
kauth like other analysts gave credence to the notion of a 
federal takeover whether its this weekend or a month from now 
or two months from now it is inevitable he said 
nonetheless the politicians statement led the bank to drop a 
policy against commenting on market rumors and regulators to drop 
theirs on a banks status 
officially we do not comment on the condition of the bank 
stockdale said but she said the incident was so weird that we 
are saying the bank will be open after the labor day holiday it 
will still be the bank of new england on tuesday the press release 
is not true 
on top its major error dimauros statement got an important 
fact wrong bank of new england is not regulated by the fdic a 
federally chartered institution its regulator is the comptroller 
of the currency 
stockdale said her office decides when a bank becomes insolvent 
and when that happens the fdic handles liquidation so she 
said the press release doesnt even talk about a situation that 
is real

texas billionaire harold c simmons wants 
lockheed corp to sell him 10 million shares of common stock and to 
amend its antitakeover defense to facilitate the sale 
nl industries inc a simmonscontrolled houston chemicals 
concern has asked lockheed to sell 10 million shares in lockheeds 
employee stock ownership plan for 35 per share 
nl also agreed not to vote those shares for three years to allay 
management fears that the 10 million additional shares would give 
away control of the company to simmons who lost a proxy battle with 
the defense contractor in march 
simmons offer was disclosed thursday in a filing with the 
securities and exchange commission in which he also reported that 
companies he controls hold 198 percent of calabasas califbased 
lockheed up from an 1894 percent stake in march 
we have received the letter and have no further comment until 
we can review the proposal scott hallman a lockheed spokesman 
said thursday 
lockheed closed down 37 cents thursday to 2637 in trading on 
the new york stock exchange 
according to the sec filing simmons companies spent more than 
14 million between aug 15 and wednesday buying 510700 lockheed 
shares at prices ranging between 2875 and 2625 
that put 125 million lockheed shares under the dallas 
billionaires control 
simmons who has been increasing his lockheed holdings since 
march 1989 lost a proxy fight with the aviation concern in march 
after lockheed chairman daniel m tellep rebuffed his request for 
board representation 
in addition to trying to oust lockheeds board of directors at 
the annual shareholders meeting simmons sought to eliminate a 
shareholder rights plan also known as a poison pill defense the 
poison pill would make it prohibitively expensive for anyone to buy 
20 percent or more of the companys common stock 
in a letter to tellep nl president j landis martin asked 
lockheed to amend the poison pill to allow the purchase of 10 
million shares from the lockheed esop that would increase his 
stake in lockheed to more than 35 percent 
analysts have said the esop which held 17 percent of lockheeds 
stock when created effectively blocks a lockheed takeover because 
in delaware where the company is incorporated a buyout must be 
approved by holders of 85 percent of a companys stock 
the company created the esop last year shortly after simmons 
revealed as required by the sec that he held more than 5 percent 
of lockheeds shares simmons reduced his holdings from 59 percent 
to 42 percent after the esop was created 
in his letter to tellep martin claimed the esop added 
approximately 500 million in debt to the companys balance 
sheet as well as increased interest payments 
if lockheed management objected to the sale of esop shares then 
it should amend the poison pill to allow nl to buy 10 million 
shares on the open market martin wrote

a capital gains tax reduction could not be

growth the congressional budget office said thursday 
it is unlikely that the increase in income would generate 
enough additional tax revenue to offset losses to the treasury

priorities but the democraticcontrolled congress has refused to 
enact the proposal 
the administration has pressed for a reduction in the capital 
gains tax rate during this years budget negotiations with 
lawmakers 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and

since iraq invaded kuwait many swedes are paying 75 to fill er 
up 
but analysts say despite exorbitant price hikes western europe 
will be less damaged than the united states by rising energy prices 
the picture that i draw is of a europe that is not as 
dependent on oil as it was at the beginning of this decade said 
peter bogin the assistant director for oil markets at cambridge 
energy research associates in paris 
oil and gas prices have increased worldwide since iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 the price of a barrel of light sweet crude hit 
32 in new york before receding this week following opecs 
decision to boost production to make up for lost iraqi and kuwaiti 
oil 
analysts expect the oil crisis to push up inflation and slow 
growth in western europe but there is little talk about an 
imminent recession as in the united states thats because of the 
factors in europes favor relatively good economic health a drop 
in oil use and the cheapness of the dollar the currency used for 
oil purchases 
western europe and the united states import about the same 
amount of crude oil per person bogin said but in addition to the 
imports americans use an equal amount of domestically produced oil 
were gas guzzlers thats the problem said paul horne an 
american who is chief international economist for smith barney 
international in paris 
europeans have always relied less on cars than americans with 
traditionally lower incomes europeans bought fewer more 
gasefficient cars many governments developed extensive train 
systems 
western europe was still hit hard economically by the energy 
crises of 197374 and 197880 but when gas prices started falling 
many governments kept them artificially high through taxation 
aiming in part to cut consumption 
thus even though many western europeans now are as wealthy as 
americans they dont buy cars that are as big or use them as much 
people cant afford to run a cadillac when the price of gas 
goes to a dollar a liter said jacques michaux the deputy head 
for oil and gas at the european communitys energy division there 
are roughly four liters to a gallon 
in italy for example the bestselling car is the compact fiat 
uno which gets about 47 miles to the gallon at 55 mph 
the most popular us car last year was the midsized sedan 
honda accord which gets about 28 mpg on the highway 
in the past decade western europe has also followed the united 
states in slashing its reliance on oil to produce electricity 
france for example has become the worlds leader in reliance 
on nuclear energy getting more than 80 percent of its electricity 
from nuclear plants 
england and west germany have switched to coal to produce some 
of their power while norway exports electricity from its numerous 
hydroelectric plants 
one glaring exception is italy which still gets nearly half its 
electricity from oil 
european industries have made a huge effort to reduce their 
use of oil said michaux he cited steel cement petrochemical and 
paper plants in particular 
the effects are dramatic between 1980 and 1989 france became 
35 percent less oilreliant while england dropped 37 percent and 
west germany 31 percent according to figures compiled by the 
cambridge energy research associates 
by comparison the united states became 20 percent less 
oilintensive in that period 
while western europe is not expected to suffer the economic 
damage it did from previous oil crises there is still concern 
about price hikes at the pump since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the increases have varied widely ranging from no rise in pump 
prices in portugal to 5 percent in italy to as much as 22 percent 
in greece 
the increases have prompted france to slap on price controls and 
west germany and britain to investigate oil companies pricing 
policies italy plans to freeze prices of petroleum products for 
three months naf norways largest auto association boycotted 
shell stations for a week after they became the first to raise 
prices before old supplies had been used up 
however many europeans have also grown used to stiff gas costs 
i didnt like it obviously said one man as he filled his 
gray fiat uno at a rome gas station but here the price is 
always going up for different reasons but its always going up

kellogg co has filed a lawsuit 
against the texas attorney generals office and health department 
after the agencies threatened to seize its controversial 
psylliumbased cereal heartwise 
the move comes one week after the battle creekbased cereal 
maker sued the iowa attorney generals office contending it has 
harassed the company for two years over health claims on special k 
40plus bran flakes now called bran flakes and frosted flakes 
in the texas case the state health department has threatened to 
order heartwise pulled from store shelves if the company does not 
alter the products labeling and include potential risks of the 
grain psyllium which the company maintains can help lower 
cholesterol 
assistant texas attorney general stephen gardner said the 
product may be detained as early as tuesday unless the company 
agrees to the changes 
kellogg is challenging that in a suit filed thursday in us 
district court in dallas 
the us food and drug administration asked kellogg last year to 
provide data showing that psyllium a soluble fiber that is used in 
laxatives is safe in foods and to back up its health claims the 
agency has not ruled yet 
the only people who view psyllium as safe in food is 
kellogg gardner said we notified them that they violated the 
law in failing to warn of potential risks such as allergic 
reactions in some people and by making claims about lowering the 
risk of heart disease 
gardner said he didnt know if there had been any consumer 
complaints about the cereal which was introduced last year 
general mills inc pulled its psylliumbased cereal benefit in 
january citing poor sales 
kellogg maintains it never claimed heartwise alone could reduce 
risk of heart disease but that as part of a complete nutritional 
diet it may reduce elevated cholesterol spokesman joseph stewart 
said he termed texas criticism of the products name a heart 
symbol and mention of two hospitals on the box as nitpicking 
its a disservice for these people to be harassing and 
nitpicking in an attempt to keep this information from the public 
on the basis it is misleading stewart said 
the assistant attorney generals threat is an irresponsible 
and politically motivated attack on our right to communicate 
scientifically supported health information about our products to 
consumers 
gardner denied stewarts allegations of political motivation and 
said neither he nor attorney general jim mattox were running for 
office 
gardner said that in discussions earlier this week kellogg 
refused the states proposal that the company pay a 25000 fine 
without having to admit any violation of the law 
only texas has questioned the heartwise advertising but the 
same cereal health claims in question in iowa are also being 
questioned in seven other states stewart said 
stewart would not say whether the company had plans to file any 
more lawsuits 
instead of being involved in this harassment its best to let 
the courts decide he said

federated stores inc will contest internal 
revenue service tax claims totaling 5856 million 
the retailing company parent of the federated and allied 
department store operators said thursday that the claims were 
based on an irs audit of the company for 1984 to 1988 the claims 
are being sought as part of federateds chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization 
federated will dispute the claims and attempt to negotiate a 
settlement said spokeswoman carol sanger 
in most cases such as this you find that what the irs 
initially asks for and what the end resolution is are pretty far 
apart she said there is usually a significant reduction in 
the end amount that is agreed upon and that would be our 
expectation 
negotiations with the irs have begun and probably will continue 
through the autumn ms sanger said 
the claims mainly involve issues related to the acquisition of 
federated department stores inc and allied stores corp by the 
canadian company campeau corp 
the issues under dispute include tax deductibility of merger and 
takeover expenses deferral of taxes on properties sold after the 
acquisitions and some items not related to the takeovers ms 
sanger said 
the preacquisition claims total 1415 million against 
federated 1187 million against allied and 3254 million 
against the parent fsi formerly known as campeau corp us inc 
interest on the claims totals 125 million but ms sanger said 
that could be reduced if there is a negotiated settlement 
the name of the us holding company for torontobased campeaus 
us interests was changed after the bankruptcy petition was filed 
last january 
companies filing for protection from creditors under chapter 11 
of the federal bankruptcy act are given the opportunity to resolve 
their financial difficulties while continuing to operate 
federateds retailing chains include abraham amp straus and 
bloomingdales of new york burdines of miami lazarus of 
cincinnati richs of atlanta and goldsmiths of memphis tenn 
allieds units include the bon marche of seattle jordan marsh of 
boston sterns of paramus nj and maas brothersjordan marsh of

the governing board of the international energy 
agency plans to discuss the worlds dwindling oil supply today in 
the wake of the united nationsimposed global boycott of oil from 
iraq and kuwait 
the meeting was originally scheduled for a week ago but was 
postponed to allow governments to assess the outlook for oil 
supplies and pursue consultations with the oil industry 
the oilwatchdog body is unlikely to call for emergency 
oilsharing measures or the use of strategic petroleum stocks a 
senior agency official said last week 
existing commercial oil stocks are probably sufficient to cover 
the estimated 45 million to 5 million barrels a day shortfall 
caused by the absence of iraqi and kuwaiti oil on the market said 
the official who spoke on condition he not be named 
but some members could tap into emergency stockpiles if war 
breaks out in the middle east he said the energy agency comprises 
21 oilconsuming nations and includes the united states canada 
japan australia and most western european nations 
the united nations imposed an embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti oil 
exports after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait a multinational 
naval force is imposing a virtual blockade on shipping to those 
countries and is prepared to use force to stop tankers from 
transporting oil from them 
the ieas standing group on emergency questions two weeks ago to 
discuss worldwide oil stockpiles prospects for saving oil by 
switching to other forms of fuel reigning in demand and spare

texas oil producers can pump about 20000 
extra barrels a day because of the persian gulf crisis but thats 
still only a fraction of the states 17 million barrel daily 
capacity 
the texas railroad commission on thursday allowed the increased 
production at federal energy officials request to help offset 
potential oil losses from an international trade embargo against 
iraq and kuwait 
the commission however refused to increase production in the 
large east texas field saying it wanted more time to consider 
arguments between independent oil producers and major oil companies 
by comparison with the 20000barrel increase opec this week 
allowed production hikes expected to cover most of 4 million 
barrels daily lost from iraq and kuwait 
in todays circumstance were asking everybody to pitch in 
and help in this effort said michael mcelwrath a principal 
deputy assistant secretary with the federal energy department 
railroad commission chairman kent hance conceded that the 
increase was insignificant compared to the amount of oil used 
daily but added its a step in the right direction 
commisioner john sharp said this is 20000 barrels more than any 
other state has provided 
the major battle was over the east texas field which has been 
restricted to 86 percent production to avoid depleting the oil 
reservoir 
major oil companies wanted to increase the allowable production 
to 100 percent which would have raised daily production by up to 
13000 barrels per day current production is approximately 93000 
barrels per day 
the smaller independents though rely on the east texas field 
and fear a rapid depletion that potentially could destroy their 
businesses while not affecting major companies which have fields 
worldwide 
commission members said they will again consider whether to 
raise the allowable production rate in that field at their next 
meeting sept 20 
independent producers and state lawmakers said major oil 
companies were driven by greed to increase production they also 
said there was no need to boost production because the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries has agreed to supply more oil 
independents and major oil companies have fought over production 
in the field since it was discovered in 1930 by 1931 1 million 
barrels of oil were being produced daily causing the price of oil 
to fall and thengov ross sterling sent the national guard to 
shut down production for three weeks

the surplus in a key japanese trade indicator fell 
633 percent in july from a year earlier the finance ministry said 
friday 
the surplus in japans current account the widest measure of a 
nations trade in goods and services fell to 202 billion in july 
from 550 billion a year earlier 
ministry officials said the current account surplus was 
continuing a downward trend despite some fluctation during the past 
few months in june the surplus climbed 122 percent to 478 
billion from a year earlier 
officials attributed julys decline primarily to the countrys 
shrinking trade surplus in goods as well as to a large deficit in 
invisible trade which includes transactions in insurance 
shipping tourism and other services 
on an unadjusted basis the trade surplus fell 229 percent to 
542 billion in july from 703 billion a year earlier 
exports inched up 13 percent while imports leapt 12 percent 
economists said the rise in imports was due largely to increased 
purchases of gold and art 
exports and imports in the current account are measured when 
contracts are settled and are different from the customsclearance 
trade figures which are announced separately by the ministry each 
month the current account does not include breakdowns of trade 
figures by country or region 
also friday the ministry of finance announced that japans 
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dipped to 21 percent in july 
from 22 percent the month before 
the jobless rate has been moving between 20 percent and 22 
percent since june 1989 the low rate has been supported by the 
continuous expansion of the japanese economy over the last 45 
months

its the land of the northern rockies big moose 
and cities so clean and efficient people say they must be run by 
the swiss but for investors canada also is home to some of the 
highestyielding government securities the world has to offer these 
days 
canadian interest rates have been on the rise since 1988 
according to lloyd g atkinson chief economist at the bank of 
montreal in toronto the spread relative to the us has been 
rising since that time and it has attracted an awful lot of 
capital 
yields on 30day canadian treasury bills are running at about 13 
percent thats 545 percentage points higher than the comparable 
us rate 
while yields are similarly high in australia and britain canada 
provides american investors with a certain comfort level albeit 
psychological because of its proximity and likeness to the united 
states plus american investors arent hit with foreign tariffs 
only us capital gains taxes 
typically american investment houses that offer clients 
canadian securities participate in the bank of canadas regular 
weekly auction of securities the brokerages then resell the bonds 
to the public 
because of bookkeeping responsibilities and costs brokerages 
must sell the bonds in higher denominations than are available 
through the canadian government dean witter reynolds inc for 
example requires a minimum investment of 10000 in a 90day bond 
even though a canadian dealer could offer it at 1000 said elaine 
williams a dean witter broker in washington who specializes in 
canadian bonds 
smaller denominations are available through canadian brokerages 
but us investors would have to open an account in canada 
investment houses also handle currency exchanges at both ends of 
the transactionrather than charge a commission dean witter covers 
its costs by reducing the yield on the security williams said she 
would offer between 1225 percent and 1250 percent for a canadian 
bond yielding 13 percent 
despite the attractive yields there are risks 
the major vulnerability lies in the canadian dollar which could 
have weakened by the time the bond has matured experts say a 
onecent decline in the canadian dollar would wipe out the benefit 
of the high yield 
canadian bonds look very attractive on the surface but when 
you do the math you have to look at it more closely said david 
kuhn a manager at toronto dominion banks office here 
even though youre picking up a wide interestrate 
differential its easy to give it back with a halfcent movement 
in the currency he said 
still the canadian dollar historically has been less volatile 
than other major currencies experts say and it has fluctuated in 
a relatively narrow band since 1989 the canadian dollar has cost 
between 8252 cents and 8860 cents the rate it touched in august 
which was a 12year high 
there is a growing sentiment that john crow governor of the 
bank of canada would not permit a sharp decline in the value of 
the canadian dollar atkinson said but he noted that much of the 
currencys recent strength is associated with the crisis in the 
middle east if the dollar were to go back to where it was at the 
end of july roughly 86 cents the bank of canada would 
shrug its shoulders he said 
though canada has a fairly stable political climate 
economically things arent too bright its not an economy 
tossing out very much profit atkinson said the country suffers 
from a large budget deficit and is on the verge of recession 
although investors are demanding a pretty sizable premium to 
put their funds into canada economists expect interest rates to 
come down to promote economic growth 
many experts say canadian securities should be viewed as a 
diversification tactic and only large investors would need to 
diversify to the extent of buying foreign bonds they say 
for everyday investors this is a hard sell dean witters 
williams said people feel uncomfortable because its foreign or 
they dont get the concept of the exchange rate i try to target 
people who travel and have been abroad

the dollar finished higher today against most 
major currencies in trading in europe gold prices fell in zurich 
and london 
dealers said the dollars rise reflected technical adjustments 
in the market as traders squared their positions before the labor 
day weekend that will close us financial markets on monday 
in tokyo the dollar rose 040 yen to a closing 14450 yen 
later in london it was quoted at 14370 yen at midday in new 
york the dollar was quoted at 14885 yen 
in london the dollar rose sharply against the british pound 
which fell to 18900 from 19225 rokla a member of the 
house gop leadership 
when the house and senate return to regular session beginning 
the week of sept 10 there will be a round of hearings that will 
include reviews of us foreign policy in the middle east military 
deployment and energy policy and the impact of all of them on the 
federal budget 
secretary of state james a baker iii will be among the first to 
testify wednesday before the senate foreign relations committee 
the members of our delegation will be making decisions over 
the next several weeks all of which are affected by the crisis 
in the gulf said house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
who was leading the 22member house delegation 
leaving about the same time in a matching blueandwhite air 
force version of the boeing 707 was a 14member senate delegation 
led by foreign relations committee chairman claiborne pell dri 
the separate delegations had similar itineraries briefings by 
us officials in saudi arabia including military commanders and 
visits with us troops in the field at dhahran and air force units 
stationed in bahrain 
on sunday the two groups were to meet in jiddah saudi arabia 
for discussions with kuwaiti and saudi officials on monday both 
groups were scheduled to meet in cairo with egyptian president 
hosni mubarak 
the house delegation is scheduled to return to the united states 
on monday while the senators were to meet with officials in oman 
and the united arab emirates and return tuesday 
we may be there for a long time and the morale of our troops 
is absolutely critical said sen carl levin dmich a member 
of the armed services committee 
referring to alternately raised and lowered hopes for the 
release of hostages by the iraqi president levin added we 
cannot be used as a yoyo by saddam hussein and that means our 
willpower must remain strong 
lawmakers said they were interested in assessing what additional 
troops allies might commit to the military buildup and progress 
toward costsharing by countries that benefit from the continued 
flow of middle east oil 
concern also was voiced about arab solidarity against saddam 
im particularly anxious to learn what the impact of a 
longterm standoff would be to what degree saddam hussein has the 
ability to create dissension within the arab world said sen 
john kerry dmass 
another goal said sen william cohen is to deter a flood of 
members of congress to the region that might distract us forces 
from their primary mission 
it would be very inconvenient for them to have to deal with 
such an influx cohen said this group will share what it learns 
with colleagues on capitol hill and hope to discourage further

260 million more than two dozen local and foreign companies had 
bid on the fields which for decades have been controled by the 
state oil company ypf

price controls next jan 1 is a key part of the 13monthold 
governments program to reorient argentinas economy toward free 
markets and away from state control

state prosecutors have begun a criminal 
investigation into alleged groundwater pollution by the adolph 
coors co according to a report 
the rocky mountain news carried the states confirmation in 
friday editions it said investigators were reviewing allegations 
that plant officials knowingly concealed leaking pipes at a golden 
can plant that tainted at least two and as many as five underground 
springs with the toxic chemical solvent tca in the 1970s and early 
1980s 
brewery president peter coors released details of the pollution 
in february along with a fiveyear 1 million cleanup program 
officials said there was no current health threat 
coors officials on thursday declined comment on the allegations 
since we first brought the problems to the attention of the 
regulatory agencies early this year weve made an effort to 
cooperate fully with those agencies and have made an effort to be 
open with the public said coors spokesman jon goldman but 
with the legal actions now being considered we really cant 
comment further

grain and soybean futures prices were lower 
friday in quiet trading on the chicago board of trade 
wheat prices were lower on technical factors involving 
deliveries for september contracts also weighing on futures prices 
was the cost of wheat being delivered in other parts of world 
wheat is being sold around the world at giveaway prices which 
is hurting the chicago market said john frazier an analyst with 
gerald inc in chicago 
there were reports earlier in the week that european community 
is heavily subsidizing wheat sales 
corn and soybean futures received some support from 
shortcovering following the sharp drop in prices through the week 
but gains were eliminated by the nearperfect weather in the 
midwest which is helping crop maturity and improving the size of 
yields 
at the close wheat was 3 cents to 6 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 262 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to cent higher with september at 243 a bushel oats

the persian gulf crisis has not been kind to 
the shipping industry whose stocks have tumbled on fears tankers 
will be idled as insurance companies impose warzone premiums and 
sailors demand hazardous duty pay 
analysts in world shipping capitals say the market complex and 
highly sensitive at best now also is confused in some cases its 
nearing panic 
we cant predict anything said michael kokkinis president 
of the greek shipbrokers association everyone is in a state of 
alert both those who are buying and those who are selling ships 
people are waiting 
stock market shipping indexes have slumped about 25 percent 
worldwide since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 said a spokesman for 
lloyds list international in london 
the spokesman who asked not to be named said norwegian and 
us shipping companies have been hit hardest an oslo business 
newspaper reported that some norwegians saw their shipping fortunes 
halved on paper within two weeks of the invasion 
other norwegian reports last week predicted a 30 percent decline 
in tanker rates loukas hadjioannou the greek owner of the worlds 
largest independent tanker fleet said 30 percent of all tankers 
could be laid up by the crisis 
the main thing that this crisis has done is once again stress 
the volatility of the shipping market how open it is to outside 
influences said david glass editor of naftiliaki a shipping 
magazine in piraeus greece 
london experts said 60 ships mostly tankers were awaiting 
orders near the persian gulf late last week at considerable cost to 
owners but they said there was some increase in chartering where 
ships are hired for specific voyages 
compounding a decline in tanker activity are increasing costs 
for shipping companies because of the dangers caused by the crisis 
crews want cash bonuses for sailing in the gulf greek 
shipowners and the panhellenic seamens federation have agreed to 
define the gulf as a danger zone 
insurance costs have increased as much as tenfold though more 
often by three times for ships in highrisk gulf areas according 
to norwegian reports 
jane vidler of lloyds insurance in london said war insurance 
rates for ships have been raised three times since aug 2 but the 
highest premiums are still just onetenth of the 75 percent of a 
ships value some owners paid during the 198088 iraniraq war 
the current situation in the middle east has led to natural 
fears and a good deal of shortterm inability to act said jarle 
hammer an analyst with fearnlet as in oslo some are clearly on 
the verge of panic panic built on uncertainty 
anxiety has pushed the paper value of norwegian ships down by 
13 billion or 19 percent since aug 1 according to oslos 
stock exchange mark jenkins senior consultant at lloyds maritime 
information service said losses reflect the jittery tone of the 
world stock market 
if this crisis goes on well be in trouble glass said 
because the developed nations will enter a recession and they 
will have a smaller demand for oil 
he said ships that can carry either oil or dry cargo then could 
enter the dry cargo market causing problems there also expensive 
tankers ordered a few years ago are being delivered now and those 
who ordered them are going to be in trouble glass said 
the shipping industry expects some relief as other nations 
including some opec members are expected to replenish up to 90 
percent of the 4 million barrels of iraqi and kuwaiti crude lost to 
the market 
also some tankers have won longer contracts to sail farther for 
alternate oil cargoes because turkey closed an overland pipeline 
from iraq 
uncertain oil supplies could increase demand for coal cargoes 
from stable suppliers such as the united states and australia and 
higher crude prices would stimulate offshore oil exploration 
eventually though the size of the worlds tanker fleet could 
decline higher energy costs tend to increase scrap metal values 
because reclaiming scrap uses less power than producing steel from 
ore which could encourage some shipowners to retire vessels 
other analysts said a depressed market could encourage 
shipowners to try to sell a large number of ships if they do 
buyers could be the greeks known for buying secondhand ships when 
prices are down and selling when times are good analysts said

bond prices were narrowly mixed in a quiet 
abbreviated session friday amid signs the manufacturing economy 
improved in august in the midwest 
the price of the treasurys bellwether 30year bond fell lsqb 
point or 125 per 1000 face amount its yield which rises when 
the bonds price falls edged up to 898 percent from late 
thursdays 897 percent 
other longterm issues were down but shortterm treasury bonds 
were narrowly higher 
analysts said a survey of chicago purchasing managers which 
indicated a slight improvement in the manufacturing sector brought 
prices lower the chicago index of business activity rose to 492 
in august from 483 percent in july 
traders fear that the fed would be less likely to relax its 
policy and allow interest rates to fall if the economy appears to 
be expanding 
the bond market tracks regional and national purchasing managers 
reports for clues about the strength of the economy and the federal 
reserves credit policy 
the national association of purchasing management is scheduled 
to release its monthly report on the economy on tuesday 
oil prices which can portend a higher inflation rate also 
helped put a damper on bond trading friday the nearterm price for 
light sweet crude rose 55 cents to 2732 a barrel on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
trading was extremely light friday in advance of the labor day 
weekend and the bond market closed several hours early the us

shortterm governments ranged from 116 point to lsqb point higher 
intermediate maturities ranged from 132 point lower to lsqb point 
higher and longterm issues were unchanged to lsqb point lower 
telerate inc a financial information service reported 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
longerterm issues fared worse than shorter maturities friday 
because the 30year bonds tie up money for longer periods and are 
more vulnerable to the effects of inflation 
the lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer rose 113 to 114388 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 759 percent as the

736 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 776 percent as the 
discount fell 2 basis points to 724 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 116 percent up from 8 
percent late thursday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 89 the average yield to 
maturity was also unchanged at 764 percent

members of the international energy agency agreed 
friday to work together to avert oil shortages from the persian 
gulf crisis but they said the threat to supplies had eased 
senior officials of the iea comprised of 21 industrialized 
nations said they expected production hikes by opec countries to 
counter the effects of the un boycott of iraq and kuwait 
the situation is much more manageable than would have been the 
case if there hadnt been the increase in opec production said 
john easton a us energy department official 
their meeting came two days after the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries agreed that saudi arabia venezuela and others 
can pump more oil to make up a shortfall of 4 million barrels a day 
lost to world markets by the boycott 
the united nations imposed the sanctions after iraq invaded 
kuwait aug 2 
when the iea governing board met two weeks ago industrial 
nations feared opec might be unable to raise production 
these increases have not only been confirmed by some opec 
countries but they are already taking place easton said noting 
oil producers have a certain amount of selfinterest to do so 
they are getting a pretty good price these days easton 
said with light sweet crude selling above 27 a barrel 
the watchdog body said it reserves the option of calling for 
emergency oilsharing measures or the use of strategic petroleum 
stocks if the situation worsens officials also renewed their call 
for conservation 
the ieas standing group on emergency questions met two weeks 
ago to discuss worldwide oil stockpiles prospects for saving oil 
by switching to other forms of fuel reining in demand and spare 
production capacity 
french foreign ministry spokesman daniel bernard meanwhile 
announced france will open talks with the iea about becoming a full 
member he did not say when they would begin 
the agency presently includes all 24 members of the organization 
for economic cooperation and development except france iceland and 
finland 
france decided not to join when the group was founded in 1974 
fearing the iea would simply be used to attack opec its interest 
has been raised by the groups efforts to limit fallout from the 
embargo 
french industry minister roger fauroux said friday that france 
must adopt measures to help the economy through a potentially 
difficult period ahead 
we must control the different factors in economic balance we 
must control salaries money and prices faroux said in an 
interview on the radio network europe 1 
faroux said stateowned gaz de france would soon sign a contract 
with norway to purchase 706 billion cubic feet of natural gas

michigans largest conservation and 
sportsmens group took aim friday at jc penney co inc for 
marketing boys clothing with an antihunting message 
the message that kids will pick up from this that the 
traditional hunting sports are wrong and that anyone who enjoys 
hunting is somehow dangerous and evil is simply outrageous 
said thomas washington executive director of the michigan united 
conservation clubs 
washington said the tags on the shirts and pants were a slap 
in the face to more than one million michigan men and women who 
enjoy hunting his organization sent a letter to the dallasbased 
company urging it to discontinue the line of clothing 
penney spokesman duncan muir said the company would make a 
decision on the merchandise next week but it may not matter for 
long the head of the company supplying the clothing said in a 
letter that the tags have been discontinued 
a card attached to each shirt in the environmental protection 
department line of clothing shows a sketch of a bird hunter 
aiming a shotgun over which a large red x has been marked 
under that are the words absolutely no hunting of wild and 
free animals while wearing this garment 
pants have a larger card with the message wild life protected 
by man surround the world with pure thoughts tags in the 
clothing indicate it was made in hong kong 
muir said penneys the nations largest department store chain 
hasnt taken a stand on hunting 
its not our position to do that and i understand that 
obviously is the message that does come across we are well aware 
of that now but certainly dont take a position like that he 
said 
we didnt produce this merchandise it came in from a supplier 
and we certainly dont endorse this position at all 
well be making a decision on the disposition of the 
merchandise sometime next week he said 
muir said he didnt know how many pieces of the clothing 
penneys had bought from the supplier h cotler co or how many 
of the companys 1330 stores were carrying them but distribution 
was nationwide 
some local store managers in the st louis area and in oregon 
already have pulled the clothes from their shelves he said adding 
he didnt know how many stores were involved 
a switchboard operator at new yorkbased cotler said offices 
were closed friday afternoon for the labor day holiday weekend 
calls to the home of the head of the company howard cotler went 
unanswered 
however in a letter to the national rifle association dated 
tuesday cotler wrote that the tags were added to the clothing as a 
marketing tool and had been discontinued 
he wrote the company neither condemns nor supports antigun or 
antihunting legislation and it was trying to appeal to the 
environmental awareness of young people 
nra researcher trey hodgkins said he contacted the company after 
the nras washington headquarters received dozens of complaints 
about the tags 
they were blatantly antihunting theres no other way to 
construe it were pleased to see hes decided to drop that from 
his marketing of the line of clothing he said 
washington said mucc which represents more than 450 clubs with 
140000 members sent its letter of protest friday after getting a 
complaint on thursday 
this kind of stuff is the worst possible stuff because it 
tries to persuade youngsters that hunting is bad kids are a prime 
target for antihunting messages he said 
hunters in general are fairly complacent and we need to make 
them aware of these kinds of things or theyll wake up one day and 
find theres no hunting

higher in the futures market friday but failed to recover all the

threatened the worlds oil supplies

exchange to end the week at 2732 per barrel on contracts for

there is a shortage of refining capacity in the world and the 
situation in the middle east has really affected those 
refineries said bernard picchi an analyst with salomon brothers 
inc a daily refining capacity of 13 million barrels has been 
taken off the world market because of the embargo of iraq and 
kuwait he said 
the middle east is not just a big crude oil exporting region 
its also a big products exporting region picchi said 
the stock market has tended to move in opposite directions from 
petroleum prices since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 but it gained 
ground friday in slow indecisive trading analysts said it was 
difficult to read much significance into the markets meanderings 
noting that many investors were getting an early start on labor day 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 2104 to 261436 
finishing the week with a net gain of 8144 points

bank of new england officials hastened 
to assure customers their money was secure friday a day after a 
political candidate mistakenly announced the institution was slated 
for liquidation 
the statement although quickly retracted raised already 
circulating rumors to fever pitch and some analysts said the 
likelihood of federal intervention with the bank remained even 
though the immediate rumor had been debunked 
whether its this weekend or a month from now or two months 
from now it is inevitable said don kauth an analyst with first 
albany corp 
bank of new england has operated under federal orders since 
early this year the bank came under heightened government scrutiny 
when a downturn in the economy and a sour real estate market 
exposed mountains of bad loans 
the bank lost close to 80 million in the first half of 1990 on 
top of more than 1 billion in losses last year 
massachusetts congressional hopeful ted dimauro ignited 
speculations about the banks future late thursday when he issued a 
news release based on rumors the bank would be seized by federal 
regulators 
regulators announced that the release was wrong bank officials 
demanded a retraction and dimauro apologized 
charles n cranmer of shearson lehman brothers inc said the 
political statement probably didnt have much effect on the banks 
basic options of promptly working out bad loans and realizing as 
much as possible through foreclosure or auction of those properties 
its just as precarious as it ever was cranmer said 
he said the bank is to minimize the bad loans but it just 
doesnt have much time i think that everybody the regulators and 
everybody else are going to do everything in their power to nurse 
it along as long as they possibly can 
dimauro made reference friday to the circulating rumors when he 
apologized at a news conference in springfield he said the former 
campaign manager terry weldon was to blame for the blunder 
i may have done the bank of new england a favor i may have 
done the depositors a favor and by talking about this issue we 
have brought the situation to light what happens after today 
thats someone elses problem dimauro said 
he just doesnt get it said bank of new england spokesman 
james dorsey who added that the bank hasnt decided yet what it 
might do about dimauros statement 
at the main springfield branch of the bank friday morning bank 
employees assured callers that the institution was open for 
business 
yesterday afternoon when these rumors were going on our 
customers called concerned today theyre calling up and theyre 
very supportive and theyre angry dorsey said 
dorsey said the episode wont sway the bank from its operating 
plan with federal regulators which calls for the bank to sell off 
assets and slash its workforce 
were making progress on a number of fronts this is a 
recovery that is going to be measured in years and its certainly 
not one thats for the faint of heart but we are making 
progress he said 
the bank which has already sold its credit card operations is 
getting control of its credit portfolio and has streamlined 
management dorsey said 
at some point in time a tough decision will have to be made 
with the regulators said gerard cassidy an analyst with 
bostonbased tucker anthony he said some observers believe if 
liquidation is considered the bank company would be broken up and 
sold off in pieces while others theorize another bank could come 
in and buy it whole 
right now its really up to the economy he said 
bank of new englands stock did recover somewhat friday on the 
new york stock exchange it closed at 212 up 1lsqb from thursday 
the stock had plummeted almost 40 percent the day before and 
employees quickly mobilized to quash the rumors answering calls 
and assuring customers that their deposits were safe dorsey said 
dimauro said he hoped voters in the democratic primary would 
forgive him 
to err is human he said

the government steeply increased 
utility rates friday and announced plans to lay off thousands of 
public employees in an effort to cut the financial deficit and 
stimulate an economy in deep recession 
hours earlier president carlos menem asked his countrymen to 
have patience with his 13monthold government which took office 
amid hyperinflation and recession 
economy minister antonio gonzalez said many public employees 
under contract would be laid off beginning in september and civil 
servants would be forced to retire early he gave no figure but 
analysts said the total would reach at least 80000 of a public 
workforce of 3 million 
gonzalez said gasoline prices for cars would go up 35 percent as 
of saturday and other public service rates would increase by an 
average 12 to 15 percent or about the rate of inflation projected 
for august 
he said his ministry will oversee the 13 biggest state 
companies which until now reported to the public works ministry 
and the major factories that until now were part of the defense 
ministry 
the state airline railroad telphone and other companies must 
pay their debts from their revenue and budgets because the central 
bank no longer will make up their deficits he announced 
the central bank will require all banks that owe it money to 
clear up their accounts those that cannot will be forced out of 
business he said 
argentina is undertaking a profound transformation of the 
public sector gonzalez said in a address on state radio and tv 
the goal is a state that is austere and efficient and 
capable of all the tasks of a modern state

reduce the role of the state in the economy and spur private 
enterprise
