jesse jackson criticized president reagans record 
on civil rights saturday during a weekend of activities honoring 
martin luther king jr 
he always put the states rights and the denial of rights over 
civil rights jackson told a crowd at the chicago headquarters of 
operation push the civil rights organization he founded 
jacksons remarks came in response to comments made by reagan in 
an interview to be broadcast sunday on the cbs television program 
60 minutes 
in the interview the president defended himself against 
criticism of his civil rights record saying he was a lifelong foe 
of discrimination 
of the black leaders who have criticized him he said 
sometimes i wonder if they really want what they say they want 
because some of those leaders are doing very well leading 
organizations based on keeping alive the feeling that theyre 
victims of prejudice 
interviewer mike wallace pressed reagan on whether he was 
referring to jackson and benjamin hooks executive director of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people 
reagan responded well you name the names i wont 
portions of the interview were broadcast thursday on the cbs 
evening news and jackson had harsh words for the president saturday 
ronald reagans problem is that he never saw a weapons system 
he didnt support and he never saw a civil rights issue that he did 
support said jackson 
with all of his persuasive comments with all of his scheming 
even america would never name a national holiday after ronald 
reagan he said martin luther king has more power in the grave 
than ronald reagan has on a horse

members of a band of chippewa indians on 
saturday voted against a state proposal for a 10 million buyout to 
limit the bands hunting and fishing treaty rights 
arlyn ackley tribal chairman said the vote was 13124 against 
the proposal 
the vote settles it for right now ackley said there might 
be another vote on it we dont know yet 
the proposal made by the state called for paying 125 million 
the first year and 1 million a year for the next nine years he 
said in exchange the band would give up treaty spearfishing 
rights except for certain ceremonial purposes and lumbering rights 
on nonreservation public lands 
seventyfive percent of the money would have been earmarked for 
economic development projects the remainder would have gone to 
tribal administration and health and welfare programs 
the proposal did not allow splitting the money between the bands 
1093 members many of whom live off the reservation in northern 
wisconsin 
ackley said news media descriptions of the proposal may have 
prevented members of the mole lake or sokaogon band from 
understanding the deal as a lease agreement not a buyout or 
sellout 
more people were interested in not selling their 
rightsthats what people thought they were voting on whether 
they were selling their rights or not said ackley 
it could have been a 25year lease agreement if extended 
beyond the initial 10 years he said 
it was the first settlement proposal to be made by the state to 
one of wisconsins six chippewa bands the mole lake band is the 
smallest of the six 
at issue are the rights upheld in federal court rulings for the 
chippewa to fish hunt and gather wild grain from nonreservation 
lands ceded to the us government under 19th century treaties

police armed with batons and water 
cannons attacked hundreds of people who staged a rally sunday to 
commemorate the 20th anniversary of an antisoviet protest in which 
jan palach committed suicide 
at least one person was badly injured and several others beaten 
by hundreds of police who tried to break up the rally by up to 1000 
people western reporters also saw plainclothes and riot police make 
at least a dozen arrests 
the rally was held in defiance of an official ban 
police had guarded wenceslas square in the capital since early 
saturday in an attempt to prevent the independent rally for palach 
who set himself on fire in the square on jan 16 1969 to protest 
soviet troops in his country 
sovietled warsaw pact troops invaded czechoslovakia in august 
1968 to crush the communistled reforms known as the prague 
spring 
sundays violence occurred after a crowd of 800 to 1000 people 
moved toward the center of the square they shouted freedom 
freedom and sang the czechoslovak national anthem 
police carrying batons immediately moved in from side streets and 
started pushing the crowd back beating several people police were 
seen beating two people trying to help an old woman who fell 
at the edge of the square meanwhile police kept back hundreds 
of others behind metal barricades 
about 10 minutes later three police water cannons started 
spraying that crowd pushing people down side streets 
other police with dogs and batons moved in clearing the top of 
the square near the statue of king wenceslas within about 20 minutes 
communist authorities banned the rally but the charter 77 human 
rights movement and four other independent groups who called it said 
they would go ahead anyway similar banned rallies in august and 
october drew thousands of people who also were dispersed by riot 
police

an express passenger train carrying 
worshipers to a religious festival crashed headon with a mail train 
in central bangladesh on sunday killing at least 110 people and 
injuring 1000 officials said 
one senior railway official said the accident the worst ever 
reported in bangladesh may have occurred because operators did not 
know how to work a newly installed signal system 
the express train bound for the southern port city of 
chittagong and the dhakabound mail train collided near the 
industrial town of tongi 30 miles north of the capital authorities 
said 
police and railway officials estimate about 2000 people were 
involved in the accident but were uncertain about how many were 
aboard each train because people frequently stand between or ride on 
top of the cars 
the cause of the accident was not immediately known and the 
government ordered an investigation but the senior railway official 
said he suspected operators at the dhaka and tongi stations were 
unfamiliar with the signalling system installed tuesday 
human failure and wrong signaling may have caused the two 
trains to come on the same track leading to the collision said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
about 250 army soldiers holding winter exercises nearby were 
dispatched to help rescue those trapped inside the wreckage and get 
the injured to hospitals in dhaka 
soldiers and rescue workers have recovered 100 bodies according 
to another railway official who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity officials said at least 1000 were injured 
communications secretary manzuraql karim told reporters at the 
scene that only 73 bodies had been found but government casualty 
figures almost always are lower than the actual count 
the two diesel locomotives crashed headon the impact knocked 
them off the rails and two coaches of each train derailed witnesses 
said several bodies were thrown into nearby rice paddies they said 
hundreds of bodies were lined up on both sides of the two 
shattered trains said syed sirajul huq a businessman from 
chittagong who suffered minor injuries in the crash 
the cries of the injured for help and people looking 
desperately for their dear ones accompanying them made me cry it 
was so pathetic he said 
according to police and railway officials the two trains crashed 
near pubail railway station the passenger train was traveling at 
about 50 mph while the mail train was coming to a halt they said 
there was a big bang said huq 
president hussain mohammad ershad and other top railway and 
government officials went to the accident scene to supervise the 
rescue operation 
most of the injured were treated at the scene at least 200 were 
taken to dhaka hospitals where 10 people later died hussain said 
about half those treated were admitted most in critical condition 
he said 
the accident occurred on the second day of a threeday religious 
gathering at tongi attended by hundreds of thousands of moslems 
from 42 countries the event the biswa ejtema or world 
congregation is the islamic worlds second largest gathering after 
the haj in mecca 
prior to sunday the worst train crash in bangladesh occurred in 
1981 near the northern district of chuadanga killing at least 81 
passengers 
according to government statistics at least 2537 train 
accidents have occurred in bangladesh in the past 15 years killing 
more than 800 people and injuring more than 7000

in this city peppered with historic plaques and 
monuments no tangible reminder stands for one of the centurys most 
startling stories the great molasses flood of jan 15 1919 but 
the memories have not died 
on that day 70 years ago firefighters drowned in the sugary 
mire horses trapped like flies on flypaper were shot by police 
survivors had to be cut from their clothing wooden buildings were 
ripped from their foundations 
when it was over 21 people were dead 150 injured no one even 
tried to count the number of horses lost 
weeks later evidence of the disaster still was turning up on 
trolley seats public telephones and doorknobs all over town 
today it takes an oldtimer to find the spot next to boston 
harbor where a steel vat burst that unseasonably mild winter day 
spewing 23 million gallons of molten molasses the chief byproduct 
of boiling the sugar out of sugar cane in 30foot waves 
it was just past noon witnesses told investigators when a deep 
rumble preceding the tanks collapse was heard 
reports at the time tell a story of congealing mayhem 
the nowdefunct boston post reported there was no escape from 
the wave caught human and animal alike could not flee running in 
it was impossible snared in its flood was to be stifled once it 
smeared a head human or animal there was no coughing off the 
sticky mass to attempt to wipe it with hands was to make it worse 
most of those who died died from suffocation 
investigators concluded that the 4yearold tank 90 feet high 
and 282 feet around owned by the purity distilling co was 
weakened by a structural flaw after six years of lawsuits the 
company was ordered to pay more than 1 million in damages 
bostons north end neighborhood was then the site of half a dozen 
candy factories but those plants are gone now as is purity 
distilling 
all a visitor will find is a baseball diamond and a boccie court 
within sight of the uss constitution hugging the dock across the 
harbor in charlestown 
but north end natives remember world war i had ended just two 
months earlier theyll tell you the year before was the last time 
the red sox won the world series 
and in 13 days gabriel piemonte who lived just up the street 
from the distillery would turn 10 
it came so fast you didnt know what it was about said 
piemonte 79 who went on to become a state legislator the worst 
part of it was the aftermath to see the molasses there and the 
stench it was thick and it was hot thank god it wasnt 
worse 
for philip dallesandro the event left a similarly vivid 
impression 
it was a thursday i was 8 years old he recalled i was 
coming home from school on my lunch hour the elevated trains were 
stopped lots of working people were on their lunch hours it 
smelled very sweet but you couldnt walk there you couldnt cross 
the street 
the brown gooey tidal wave of molasses swallowed everything in 
its path it swamped houses one home caved in killing the woman 
inside 
a young girl perished with firewood she was collecting still in 
her arms 
one historic account notes that firefighter william connor was 
playing cards in the station house next door 
i sat facing the window and as i glanced up i saw this great 
wall of molasses it came with the speed of a cyclone he 
said the flood of molasses at times flowed up to our ears we 
bumped our heads on the floor above trying to keep our noses and 
mouths above the fluid one firefighter drowned 
it took weeks of scrubbing and saltwater to clean the surrounding 
streets of the last of the black sticky soup 
for years afterward people claimed they could still smell the 
molasses

the tass news agency apologized sunday for 
reporting that six armenians had been saved after spending 35 days 
in earthquake rubble and said its story was a mistake and delusion 
a painstaking search conducted over the past days did not 
confirm the story which we would like to believe so much tass 
correspondents eduard shakhnazaryan and akop shakkbazyan wrote 
we were the first to report this and today we want to offer 
our apologies to our readers they said 
such a public apology from the official agency is highly unusual 
tass is wont to contrast its brand of journalism with what it 
sees as western sensationalism a book written by the agencys late 
director sergei losev is titled simply tass gives you the real 
facts 
the communist party daily pravda which printed tass original 
rescue story wrote readers may ask the question why did tass 
correspondents rush to report the leninakan miracle and why did 
many newspapers including pravda that believed them rush to print 
this dispatch probably because we all believe in good news we want 
the number of people saved to be bigger 
on thursday tass distributed an electrifying report quoting 
aikaz akopyan 50 as saying he and five other people survived five 
weeks in the rubble of a ninestory leninakan apartment building by 
eating food stored in the cellar 
that story was picked up by many soviet newspapers and foreign 
media and akopyan told his story to the national evening television 
news program vreyma in an interview from his hospital bed in 
yerevan armenias capital 
the tale of the rescue which akopyan said took place jan 11 
made headlines around the world because rescue officials weeks 
before had abandoned the search for survivors of the dec 7 
earthquake that killed 25000 people in northwestern armenia 
however 24 hours after its original report tass acknowledged it 
had not been able to find the other people akopyan said he was 
trapped with the rescuers who reportedly saved them or a single 
witness to the incident 
on saturday tass said akopyans sister julietta said the story 
was a hoax intended to get akopyan into a good hospital 
when akopyan was admitted to the yerevan hospital he was 
reported ill with pneumonia as a result of his entrapment in the 
quake rubble but tass said a specialist in internal medicine 
believes akopyan has suffered chronic lung and heart deficiencies 
for several years 
tass on saturday night said doctors still could not rule out the 
possibility that akopyans story was accurate but its sunday 
apology pointedly said the leninakan electrician was the source of 
its mistaken report 
what was the reason for the delusion tass asked the sick 
imagination of akopyan whose story was heard not only by us but 
also by millions of tv viewers from the hospital or a selfish 
intent now it is difficult to give a straightforward answer 
tass earlier reported that akopyan had threatened to jump out of 
his hospital room window if journalists did not stop bothering him 
and said doctors took his threats seriously 
the doctors continue their efforts to save the life of aikaz 
akopyan and believe his life will soon be out of danger tass 
said 
as far as akopyans reported motive for telling the rescue story 
tass said armenias health minister emil gabrielyan had commented 
there is no need for using such extreme methods for any patient in 
armenia to get skilled medical aid

hiroshi yabuta the first japanese to receive a 
liver transplant in another country has died a hospital official 
said sunday he was 53 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said yabuta 
died friday of acute kidney failure at kinki university hospital in 
western japan 
no liver or heart transplants have been performed in japan since 
1968 because of controversy over the legal definition of death for 
potential organ donors yabuta received the transplant at 
massachusetts general hospital in boston on april 8 1985 and 
returned home seven months later 
in 1968 an 18yearold boy underwent japans first heart 
transplant but died 82 days later at sapporo medical college in 
northern japan 
the doctor who performed the operation was accused of obtaining 
the heart from a braindead person traditionally japanese have 
considered death to occur only after a persons heart stops beating 
the doctor was accused of murder in a citizens complaint but 
official murder charges were never filed 
nevertheless japanese doctors halted heart and liver transplants 
as a result of the controversy 
the hospital official refused to provide further details on 
yabutas death but kyodo news service said an autopsy showed no 
irregularities in yabutas transplanted liver or any symptoms of 
rejection 
it said his death may have been caused by a decline in body 
resistance caused by medicine yabuta took to prevent rejection of 
the liver 
since yabutas transplant about 30 japanese mostly children 
have received liver transplants in the united states europe and 
australia eight of them have died kyodo said

nato the warsaw pact and 12 other 
european nations sunday wound up more than two years of hard 
bargaining by adopting a human rights and security agreement hailed 
as historic by both superpowers 
romania however immediately served notice it would not 
implement some provisions intended to enhance freedom for millions 
in the soviet bloc 
a text of romanias statement which was made in a closeddoor 
meeting and distributed later by its state news agency agerpres 
said bucharest takes no pledge to stick to commitments on 
greater religious freedom and emigration 
us ambassador warren zimmermann dismissed the statement as 
illegal and absurd 
we simply dont take seriously the romanian view that theyre 
at liberty to implement our document selectively he told 
reporters they will pay a price for it if they try 
in czechoslovakia meanwhile riot police used water cannons 
batons and dogs to break up crowds of almost 2000 people at a 
banned independent rally just an hour after the accord was adopted 
the document adopted by consensus of the 35 nations who signed 
the 1975 helsinki final act paves the way for new natowarsaw pact 
talks in march on reducing conventional forces across europe 
secretary of state george shultz soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze and their colleagues from 33 other nations are expected 
to discuss preparations for the new arms control talks when they 
meet in vienna on tuesday 
the vienna accord lays down greater freedom for east bloc 
citizens to practice religion travel or emigrate to the west 
obtain and distribute information and form groups to monitor 
government compliance with human rights agreements 
for the first time the accord also gives western and neutral 
governments theright to raise human rights issues with east bloc 
nations at any time 
its an excellent document one that can play a historic role 
in the development of the helsinki process zimmermann said 
the 1975 helsinki final act signed by the superpowers canada and 
all european nations except albania gave moscow the recognition it 
long sought of the post1945 division of europe 
but it also put human rights firmly on the eastwest agenda 
where they have played an increasingly important role 
western and east bloc diplomats were unanimous that mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms in the soviet union and willingness to disarm 
contributed to the advances made at vienna 
one of the biggest sticking points of the 27month conference was 
a human rights conference in moscow scheduled for 1991 
the release of more than 600 political prisoners reunification 
of more than 100 divided families and a nineyear high in jewish 
emigration persuaded the united states and britain to agree this 
month to go to moscow 
but they insisted soviet reforms must continue and be written 
into law 
soviet ambassador yuri kashlev said the agreement to hold the 
moscow conference constituted international recognition of the 
policies pursued by gorbachev 
the mechanism for raising human rights issues on a bilateral 
level is a major breakthrough kashlev said the whole process 
has now been raised to a qualitatively new level unprecedented 
after helsinki 
his only dissenting note came over accords on economic 
cooperation which kashlev quantified as modest 
western restrictions on the east blocs import of technology 
hamper progress in this area he said noting however that the 
soviet bloc also must do more to modernize its economy 
asked about romanias dissent on some provisions kashlev said it 
did not threaten the consensus of the helsinki process 
but zimmermann and other western ambassadors served notice they 
will judge romania and other east bloc nations by their performance 
on human rights 
there is still a long way to go said british ambassador 
lawrence okeeffe 
zimmermann said that as he spoke czechoslovakia was violating 
the freedom of assembly granted in spirit by the final act by 
banning the rally broken up in prague on sunday 
the vienna accord also stipulates an end to torture and 
psychiatric abuse of prisoners and calls for several followup 
conferences including a forum on freely available information in 
london this spring and a 35nation conference on the environment in 
sofia bulgaria later this year 
the sofia meeting drew more dissent from turkey which said its 
government would find it difficult to attend if bulgaria continued 
to oppress its turkish minority 
bulgaria responded that it has no such minority since 1984 
bulgarian turks have been forced to change their names to 
bulgariansounding names 
the final document provides for the protection of minority 
rights but human rights groups such as the international helsinki 
federation have noted the text provides a loophole because states 
can simply deny the existence of such minorities

a dozen times a week flight 3323s engines 
crank into a throbbing whine and launch an 18passenger turboprop 
out of one of the nations busiest airports into one of air travels 
loneliest routes 
the federally subsidized flight from hartsfield atlanta 
international airport 200 miles south to moultrie averages about one 
passenger often the plane flies empty of passengers 
as the government looks for some wings to clip flight 3323s 
days may be numbered 
moultrie population 16000 is one of about 150 rural american 
towns protected since airline deregulation in 1978 by the 
governments essential air service program 
many of the towns are in isolated areas where bus and train 
service has diminished while some of the flights are seldom used 
they often are the only link short of long car trips between two 
cities 
under eas provisions the government pays the airlines to keep 
flying the routes 
it would cost 316 million annually in subsidies to maintain 
current eas flights but only 25 million has been appropriated this 
fiscal year and the department of transportation says cuts must be 
made 
eastern atlantis express the eastern airlines affiliate that has 
operated the atlantamoultrie route since 1983 had 1248 scheduled 
departures between the two cities last year and sold 1301 oneway 
tickets an average of just over one a flight 
the oneway fare is 104 flight 3323s subsidies last year were 
379000 which works out to about 291 per passenger 
on friday morning a reporter and rosalind johnson a moultrie 
native who lives in denver were the only passengers on the onehour 
flight to this southern georgia farm town the amiable copilot 
walked back from the curtained cockpit squatted in the aisle and 
explained the many safety features of the aircraft 
any questions he asked ok lets go 
ive been the only passenger on this flight many times said 
mrs johnson who has been making the trip often recently because of 
sick relatives 
the town has no college or major industry there is no amtrak 
service within 130 miles the bus trip from atlanta takes 5 hours 
it would be a shame not to have it mrs johnson said of the 
airline route i dont know what ill do if they stop fly to 
albany and drive i guess albany with several daily flights is 
a 40minute drive from moultrie 
an inaudible message crackled over a loudspeaker usually they 
just lean back into the cabin and shout if they want us to know 
something she said over the engine 
on the return to atlanta the plane held six passengers one 
young woman going to atlanta to visit friends said she usually 
drives but its three and a half hours each way and that gets 
long after a while she said 
in deciding what subsidies may be cut the transportation 
department is looking at several factors including whether air 
service is available elsewhere in the area which routes have high 
subsidies and which routes have the fewest passengers 
we most likely will be targeted said david howard a vice 
president of the florence scbased atlantis line we did refile 
last july to keep the market he said the subsidy allows a profit 
of 5 percent 
the essential air service subsidy program was authorized for 10 
years and has been extended with modifications into 1998 david 
smallen a spokesman for the house public works and transportation 
committee said congressmen from rural districts are dedicated to 
keeping it 
bill mosley a spokesman for the department said it is too early 
to guess which or how many of the routes ultimately will be cut

deaths from heart and blood vessel 
disease dropped 24 percent over the past decade but it remains by 
far the nations biggest killer taking a life every 32 seconds the 
american heart association said sunday 
the good news is that we continue to see an improvement in the 
death rate from the biggest killer of our population said dr 
bernadine healy of the cleveland clinic foundation who is president 
of the heart association 
those trends are dramatic and dont seem to be reversing she 
said the bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost 1 
million americans a year and weve got a long way to go 
the association released the statistics at its annual forum for 
science writers 
experts attribute the decline in death rates to a combination of 
healthier living habits including fewer cigarettes and better food 
and improved medical treatment 
the public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made 
in heart disease over the past 20 years said dr myron l 
weisfeldt of johns hopkins university its almost unbelievable 
there is almost no form of heart disease that we cant approach 
without meaningful treatment 
however weisfeldt who is presidentelect of the heart 
association also cautioned that much work remains both in 
improving care and encouraging people to take better care of their 
health 
i believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemic 
heart disease in the united states by the year 2000 if we stop 
smoking get cholesterol treated if its above 220 and identify and 
treat hypertension he said 
ischemic heart disease is the clogging of blood vessels that feed 
the heart it underlies most heart attacks the single most lethal 
heart ailment 
association figures indicated that in 1986 the most recent year 
for which there are statistics an estimated 978500 americans died 
from heart attacks strokes and other diseases of the heart and 
blood vessels cancer the no 2 killer took 466000 lives 
between 1976 and 1986 the death rate from all forms of 
cardiovascular disease fell 24 percent it declined 28 percent for 
heart attacks and 40 percent for strokes 
the associations figures show that more than one in four 
americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease and almost 
half of those eventually die from it 
about 60 percent of the heart attack deaths occur before the 
victim reaches the hospital studies show that about half of all 
heart attack victims wait more than two hours before getting to an 
emergency room 
weisfeldt said a major health goal is getting people to go to the 
hospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heart 
attacks during this period there is still time to give them drugs 
to dissolve the blood clots that are causing their heart attacks 
this treatment can save lives and reduce the disability of heart 
attacks 
other major goals he said include finding ways to improve the 
effectiveness of angioplasty a technique that uses balloons to open 
clogged heart arteries and finding surgical and medical techniques 
to identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest 
the heart association estimates that cardiovascular disease will 
cost 882 billion this year in medical expenses and lost wages 
among other statistics released by the association 
the most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure 
which affects 60 million americans 
about 200000 of the deaths from cardiovascular disease each 
year occur in people under age 65 
there were 1418 heart transplants in 1987 almost nine times as 
many as in 1983 
about 25 million americans have angina the chest pain 
resulting from clogged heart arteries about 300000 new cases occur 
annually 
as many as 15 million americans will have heart attacks this 
year

a radio moscow statement aired here sunday 
quoted the deputy chief of the kgb as saying the soviet service 
would work with the american british and israeli intelligence 
agencies to fight terrorism 
the offer believed to be unprecedented was attributed to lt 
gen vitaly ponomarev secondincommand of the soviet security 
service 
it first was aired by radio moscows hebrewlanguage division 
peace and progress on saturday the report was recorded by an 
israel radio monitor mickey gurdus and retransmitted on the 
station sunday 
according to gurdus the report began with an announcer saying 
that ponomarev has appeared in front of our microphone 
ponomarev followed with several sentences spoken in russian and his 
voice then faded out to be replaced by the hebrew translation 
we are willing if theres a need to cooperate even with the 
cia the british intelligence service and the israeli mossad and 
other intelligence services in the west a soviet announcer 
quoted ponomarev as saying 
we realize we have to coordinate efforts to prevent terrorist 
acts including hijacking of planes he added 
ponomarev also said the latest technology had to be used against 
terrorists 
isser harel who headed the mossad from 1952 to 1963 called the 
soviet statement a possible propaganda ploy 
the soviets are allies of terrorismsponsoring states like 
syria and libya maybe they want us to disclose what we know to the 
other side but i dont believe they will give us any of their 
information harel said in a telephone interview 
radio moscow quoted ponomarev as saying the west accused the kgb 
of supporting terrorism in order to alienate the organization within 
soviet society while in fact the kgb was part of the society and 
thus rejected terrorism 
harel said the kgb and the mossad traditional rivals never have 
cooperated and the soviets would have to come a long way before 
coordination with the west was possible 
despite the lack of diplomatic relations which moscow which were 
cut in 1967 israel and the soviet union did work together in 
dealing with a hijacked soviet plane last year us officials 
reportedly also were involved 
four hijackers who had seized a bus full of children and traded 
them for 2 million and an airplane surrendered immediately after 
reaching israel on dec 2 they were extradited to the soviet union 
together with the plane and the money a day later

called it an aftershock of a temblor that occurred more than two 
years ago 
no damage was reported from the 739 am quake which measured 
40 on the richter scale of ground motion officials said the 
epicenter was 28 miles southwest of oceanside the city is about 30 
miles north of san diego 
seismologists at the california institute of technology said the 
quake was an aftershock of one that struck the area on july 13 
1986 that one measured 53 on the richter scale said caltech 
spokesman hall daily 
police in oceanside and the coastal towns of costa mesa and san 
clemente both in orange county had no calls reporting the quake 
costa mesa police officer kathy smith who lives in el toro said

almost threequarters of the victims of violent 
crimes who survived to tell the tale say they made some effort to 
protect themselves and most believe their resistance was worthwhile 
according to a federal survey 
the 100000 victims interviewed as part of the justice 
departments national crime survey were subjected to rape robbery 
aggravated assault and simple assault 
in the report issued sunday the bureau of justice statistics 
said the methods of resisting among the 73 percent who reported 
doing something ranged from attacking the attacker to threatening 
him or her to screaming from pain or fear 
about a third resisted or tried to capture the offender about a 
fourth ran away or hid and another fourth tried to persuade or 
appease the offender some tried more than one tactic 
while 63 percent felt their action helped the situation 7 
percent said it harmed 6 percent said it helped and hurt 13 
percent said it did neither and 11 percent were not sure 
about threefifths of the violent crime victims who felt that 
selfprotection helped the situation indicated that their actions 
helped them avoid injury or greater injury said the report by 
catherine j whitaker 
about 31 percent of those who felt their selfprotection measures 
were beneficial said they worked by helping scare off the offender 
and about 19 percent of the victims said their actions helped them 
make their own escape 
the report cautioned that the findings should not be used to 
recommend whether or not victims should defend themselves or to 
determine the measures that are most effective 
the survey did not determine the exact circumstances of each case 
or whether the victims were correct in their determination of what 
harm the assailant had intended before the selfprotective actions 
were taken 
finally it should be noted that the national crime survey does 
not collect information on homicides and therefore misses any cases 
of selfprotection that may have resulted in the death of the 
victim the report says 
john stein deputy director of the national organization for 
victim assistance says theres no universally appropriate response 
to a violent crime and that even if there were one the likelihood 
is that the victim would be too shocked to carry it out 
if we do resist its not because its a calculated decision 
said stein when were working with victims our first rule is if 
theyre alive we tell them you did the right thing rule two is 
even if you were brilliant or what you think was stupid the 
likelihood was any reaction you had was something you probably could 
not have changed 
it all stems from the flight or fight reaction to stress that 
scientists say remains at the core of the human physiology 
when one is confronted with a violent criminal the situation 
clearly is not one in which training thinking cognitive stuff is 
taking place a lot stein said 
im not saying we are powerless in moments of crisis but we 
certainly emphasize to victims is that the level of decisionmaking 
we are likely to operate under is very low very primitive he 
said thats one of the reasons why were not certain that for 
example selfdefense training is likely to have much of an impact 
over the ability of a wouldbe victim to turn an assault into merely 
an attempted and unsuccessful assault 
other key findings of the survey 
victims said they believed their assailants were under the 
influence of drugs or alcohol in about 36 percent of violent crimes 
including 46 percent of the rapes 
police when notified of a crime arrived within 10 minutes to 
see the victim in 56 percent of the violent crimes 38 percent of 
personal thefts and 35 percent of household crimes they arrived 
within an hour in 95 percent of violent crimes 84 percent of 
personal thefts and 85 percent of household crimes previous surveys 
have found that police are called only in about half of all violent 
crimes 40 percent of household crimes and 25 percent of personal 
thefts 
police had later contact with victims in 37 percent of the 
violent crimes reported to them including 62 percent of rapes as 
well as 35 percent of household crimes and 25 percent of personal 
thefts 
the victim received help or advice from a victim assistance 
office or agency other than the police in a little under 10 percent 
of the violent crimes reported to police 
the surveys results were based on interviews between july 1986 
and june 1987 with about 100000 people age 12 and older in 49000 
households selected to represent all parts of the country the 
justice department said 
the report did not estimate how much the survey results would 
differ if every crime victim were asked the same questions however 
traditional polls involving barely 1000 people typically have 
margins of error in the 3to4percent range

satanic verses from its 430 stores in britain company officials 
were quoted as saying sunday after a rally against the novel 
the sunday times and the mail on sunday reported that officials 
of w h smith and sons ltd said their decision was made because the

police said 1500 people rallied saturday in the industrial city 
of bradford against the book by indianborn author salman rushdie 
the rally was organized by the citys council of mosques and a

been banned in saudi arabia and india highlights an indian actors 
internal struggle against the forces of evil 
it is a commercial consideration we are not bowing to 
pressure the times quoted smith managing director malcolm field 
as saying 
but we have to bear in mind that a whole shop could be 
threatened by this sort of thing he said 
the booksellers retail marketing director terence ludbird said

shelves the mail reported it said ludbird told the newspaper the 
decision to pull it from stores had already been made when the

a new kit teaches parents to test children as 
young as 7 for drug use by examining their eyes daily with a 
flashlight but some drug abuse experts say it will just erode trust 
between parent and child 
seven years of age thats like a nazi kind of thing said 
linda paire santa ana clinic director of the orange county drug 
abuse program 
but dave hannah president of athletes for a strong america who 
says he uses the eye test on his two sons daily said last week that 
parents need to work together with their children to stop the 
growing drug problem in america 
and the steps should begin around age 7 when some surveys find 
children are first being exposed to drugs he said 
we live in a world today where drugs are rampant if parents 
start with their kids when they are young and team up and use the 
kit it will be like brushing your teeth he said 
athletes for a strong america a nonprofit group based in 
irvine markets the 4995 kit called the winners program it 
includes a videotape audio tapes written material and a medical 
flashlight 
it teaches parents to make the sort of checks common in roadside 
sobriety tests looking for redness in the white of the eye a 
toolarge or toosmall pupil the pupils ability to constrict when 
exposed to light the eyes ability to track a moving object from 
side to side without jumping and the eyes ability to converge on 
an object that is brought close to the face 
but paire questioned the effectiveness of such tests 
theres a lot better ways to prevent drug abuse in your kids 
she said even the best urine tests we have today are not 
foolproof there are so many other things that could cause so 
many similar reactions that i would hate a parent or teacher to pin 
it on drugs 
rene topalian assistant director of drug abuse services for the 
los angeles county health department said that two years ago a 
group marketed a kit for parents to test urine and it didnt get 
anywhere 
everything we try to project in prevention is to not take 
intrusive measures as home topalian said calling for parents to be 
conscientious and work to develop the childs selfesteem 
hannah said the videotaped test instructions show parents how to 
use the test without alienating their children 
i have two sons ages 18 and 21 and i test their eyes every 
day said hannah a former college football player 
its not that i dont trust them they have never done 
anything but taking crack just one time can ruin a childs life 
about 3500 kits have been sold in the past six months hannah 
said it has been marketed only at conferences and not yet widely 
distributed the organization makes 5 which is reinvested in the 
program and the salesperson makes 25 he said 
there are probably highrisk situations where a parent is 
desperate but i wouldnt advocate it as primary prevention said 
andy johnson a social psychologist with the university of southern 
californias school of medicine who deals with drugabuse what 
does it do in terms of trust between parent and child 
but if the child is already using or is trying to hide it its 
not a bad idea he said 
the test was developed with the help of dr forest tennant a 
drug adviser to the national football league the los angeles 
dodgers and the california highway patrol tennant advocates that 
parents schoolteachers and coaches learn the basics of the test so 
they can understand the effects of drugs on the body

mcdonalds is coming to bainbridge island 
and some residents of this puget sound oasis fear it could be the 
beginning of the end of a quiet lifestyle that revolves around 
families and ferry schedules to seattle 
the city of winslow is taking steps to make sure the fast food 
restaurant will not shake up the community when it arrives as early 
as this spring 
what promises to be washington states first law banning 
plasticfoam containers such as the kind big macs and other 
mcdonalds hamburgers come in is one way officials hope to limit 
the environmental impact 
but many officials say mcdonalds is just a symbolic target of 
much deeper concern 
i think the real reason for concern is that theyre not 
afraid of deepfried food and the looks of the thing so much as they 
feel it represents an incursion into the isolation that bainbridge 
island has said bob chapel a winslow city councilman 
i think its fear of change agreed terry dolan another 
councilman in my opinion the mcdonalds itself is not a 
significant change i think the mcdonalds is a symbol of change 
that has already taken place and theyre taking it out on 
mcdonalds 
bainbridge island home to 13000 people including many 
whitecollar professionals who commute by ferry to seattle sits 
between two of washingtons fastestgrowing areas 
seattle to the east bristles with new skyscrapers the kitsap 
peninsula lies to the west and kitsap county has been booming for 
several years thanks largely to the arrival of the navys trident 
submarine base at bangor 
i guess were fortunate that we havent had this kind of 
pressure before and maybe were kind of spoiled said vince 
mattson a director of the citizen association of bainbridge 
communities which monitors island development but weve seen 
whats happened elsewhere and we certainly dont want it to happen 
here 
in fact there really is no organized opposition to mcdonalds 
alone and the fastfood restaurant is just development planned in a 
commercially zoned area near the ferry terminal also planned is a 
safeway which would compete with the two locally owned supermarkets 
on the island 
but a spate of letters in the local weekly newspaper and comments 
at public meetings already have led the city council to change the 
towns sign ordinance in an effort to restrict the size of 
mcdonalds golden arches logo the ban on plasticfoam containers 
to be considered by the city council feb 2 also is almost sure to 
pass council members say 
john onoda director of media relations at mcdonalds 
headquarters in oakbrook ill said the companys policy is to 
comply with all local ordinances 
you have to be flexible to be as successful as mcdonalds is 
he said 
still the fear of a unique community slipping away will remain 
for some chapel said 
you dont realize it and you dont even think about it but 
living on an island creates an island mentality he said its 
quiet and peaceful here and you want to keep it that way thats why 
people moved here because there are no golden arches to drive by 
on the way home

while presidentelect george bush plied 
waters off the florida keys for bonefish environmentalists and 
politicians gathered near here hoped bushs interest in the states 
natural resources will be reflected in his presidency 
after eight lost years in the reagan administration i think 
the entire conservationist community is very excited a little ill 
at ease anxious to see what happens said nathaniel reed a 
former undersecretary of the interior and a leading florida 
environmentalist who advised bush during his presidential campaign 
reed was among more than 200 environmentalists politicians and 
government officials attending the fourth annual everglades 
coalition meeting over the weekend as bush was fishing to the 
southeast on the other side of the everglades national park and 
florida bay 
florida officials realizing the states runaway growth is 
threatening its water supply and killing off species of plants and 
animals in the past decade have started ambitious landbuying and 
restoration projects but their efforts have gone against the tide 
of reagan administration policy that made economic benefits a 
priority in federal lands 
i find it of particular interest that he comes to the florida 
keys said rep dante fascell dfla he may have a special 
interest in floridas environment and take more than a bureaucratic 
look at it 
since his election bush has twice vacationed in south florida 
and environmentalists consider his love for fishing significant 
he actively participates in the environment and one of the 
first things to go when you have damage is the fishing said 
charles lee vice president of the florida audubon society 
environmentalists saw further signs of bushs interest when the 
presidentelect met with everglades national park superintendent 
mike finley 
in the hastily arranged meeting saturday at islamorada finley 
said he found bush interested in the many problems facing the 
everglades 
reed called it significant that bush described himself during the 
campaign as an environmentalist using a term conservatives tend to 
link to liberal democrats reed said 
the reagan administration reed said caused a brain drain of 
bright youths from the federal environmental agencies because they 
were frustrated and also lost valuable time for conservation 
efforts 
he said bush needs to make sure his environmental agencies and 
interior department start out with enthusiasm and a cando 
attitude that will rally conservationists 
a priority for florida environmentalists is adding at least 
105000 acres to the everglades national park but officials said 
obtaining the land and federal funding will be difficult 
florida gov bob martinez who was a national cochairman for the 
bush campaign will meet this week in washington with incoming 
interior secretary manuel lujan and william reilly whom bush named 
as director of the environmental protection agency 
i kind of think the presidents going to enjoy fishing out that 
way and anything we can tie ourselves to to show what needs to be 
done we certainly need to do that martinez said

george bushs foreign policy team plans a 
sweeping review of us strategic interests to key on changes in the 
soviet union and cope with economic competition from other 
countries according to top aides 
bush has said that such a review would delay the resumption of 
arms talks with the soviets from their scheduled resumption on feb 
15 and the review is expected to change the pentagon budget that 
president reagan sent to capitol hill this month 
senior bush aides interviewed on condition of anonymity said 
the goal is not a radical shift in ussoviet relations or in 
american strategic forces 
rather the new administration wants to do some longrange 
planning to sort of look out ahead to hypothesize the kind of 
world that we would like to see and then to look at the kind of 
forces that are at work for or against that kind of world said 
one man who has been named to a senior post 
the new administration also plans to seek a diplomatic solution 
in central america said a second senior foreign policy adviser to 
bush 
if the diplomatic effort fails to bring greater democracy to 
nicaragua and end the leftist insurgency against usbacked el 
salvador then the bush administration might ask congress to resume 
military aid the contra guerrillas who have been fighting 
nicaraguas sandinista government 
in the middle east the administration also will be seeking to 
determine whether an international peace conference is possible in 
the wake of statements by palestine liberation organization chairman 
yasser arafat that he opposes the use of terrorism said an aide 
ussoviet relations likely will occupy center stage early in 
the new administration 
bush has said that the reform policies of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev present new opportunities for the united 
states but that the kremlin leader has not changed the basic nature 
of the communist state 
i am impressed with what mr gorbachev says and i really think 
he wants better relations bush said in a recent television 
interview 
the improved climate in ussoviet relations under reagan and 
gorbachev has started to change the shape of the world said one 
bush aide 
rather than struggling with the heritage of the cold war the 
aide said it is time to think about what kind of europe we and 
the europeans really want to see what kind of relationship with the 
soviet union would we like to construct if we could 
and if us perception of a soviet threat diminishes said the 
aide the administration will have greater opportunity to turn to 
the fundamental questions of americas relations with its trading 
partners in europe and asia 
the new administration will need to determine what kind of a 
world trading system is possible and how can we shape it the 
aide said those are the kind of things bush is talking 
about 
in negotiations with the with the soviet union said the aide it 
may be time to back away from the details of arms control and 
examine larger issues such as the degree of freedom allowed soviet 
bloc states in eastern europe 
the review likely would be conducted by top white house 
officials such as national security adviser brent scowcroft and his 
no 2 former cia deputy director robert gates along with dennis 
ross of the state department policy planning office and possibly the 
defense department undersecretary for policy who has not yet been 
named 
the initial review likely would lead to some changes pentagon 
plans for strategic weapons systems and in negotiating proposals 
with the soviet union said the aide

soviet farmers who take advantage of economic 
reforms to lease stateowned land are treated by bureaucrats and 
neighbors like capitalistminded rockefellers and a law is 
being prepared to protect them president mikhail s gorbachev said 
gorbachevs comments friday indicated widespread hostilty in the 
nations agricultural regions to his plan announced in november to 
push the leasing system into all areas of farming to better the 
countrys food supply 
the soviet leader chaired a meeting in the communist partys 
central committee devoted to farm reforms the text of his remarks 
was reprinted on sunday by pravda the party daily and a tape of 
the meeting was shown on soviet television 
allowing families and other small groups of farmers to rent land 
on longterm leases from giant collective and staterun farms smacks 
to some of capitalism or the early days of soviet power when rich 
peasants called kulaks were considered class enemies 
gorbachev said 
leasing is proceeding with difficulty and thus many people 
the innovators are being called kulaks and rockefellers he said 
many people especially the lazy dont like the fact that 
leasing is destroying the ethics and habits of the years of 
stagnation when you could get a good salary no matter how you 
worked yes lets say it directly when you could steal from the 
common courtyard gorbachev said 
a law is being prepared to protect the rights of people who take 
out such leases gorbachev said it will embrace all branches of 
the national economy he said but gave no further details 
his comment apparently means the leasing system which gorbachev 
says will invigorate chronically ailing soviet agriculture also 
will be applied to the industrial and service sectors which also 
suffer shortages 
gorbachev said a plenary meeting of the communist partys 
policymaking central committee devoted to agriculture would be held 
in march in november he had said such a plenum on the farmleasing 
system would be held in february he gave no reason for the change 
in date 
gorbachev the son of a southern russian peasant has said 
furnishing the soviets with food is the countrys no 1 domestic 
problem and that the leasing system will transform the countrys 
farmers into masters of the land by encouraging them to work 
harder for greater earnings 
in his remarks friday he said it had once been historically 
necessary to put pressure on the village to extract resources for 
soviet industrialization apparently referring to the policies of 
dictator josef v stalin 
but what should only have been a temporary measure dictated by 
necessity became the norm said gorbachev who was the communist 
partys specialist on agriculture before becoming its general 
secretary in march 1985 
he said government bureaucrats and leaders of collective and 
state farms no longer have the right to dictate their will to others 
and that their motto should be dont interfere but help

dr deborah brown wanted to serve the poor 
for six months the young family physician got her wish 
developing close relationships with her mostly single and minority 
women patients at the maxicare clinic in drugstained east oakland 
however when one of the states largest health maintenance 
organizations decided it was too costly to serve 11000 poor people 
in the san francisco bay area partly because of the high cost of 
treating cocaineaddicted patients the clinic she works at was 
scheduled to shut down 
brown and her patients were dumped back into a system where 
private health care for the poor is an increasingly rare commodity 
one of the things that this points up is that theres a 
twotiered healthcare system in this country said brown who 
wants a job that will reunite her with her former patients 
theres the care that people that have insurance have available to 
them in terms of private physicians and then theres the clinic 
system where people kind of get dumped 
maxicares decision to end a contract with the state to provide 
health care to the poor in alameda san francisco and contra costa 
counties raised questions about the adequacy of state reimbursements 
for prepaid health care the ability of county health agencies to 
cope with the growing numbers of poor and the expensive tragedy of 
cocaineaddicted patients and their children 
alameda county officials protested the closure plans insisting 
already overcrowded public health clinics where patients often 
wait three months for an appointment cannot handle the additional 
patients or the extra cost of cocainerelated births 
maxicare cited two reasons for its pullout insufficient 
reimbursement from medical a state and federally funded health 
care program for the poor to cover the actual cost of serving its 
statecovered patients and the climbing expense tied to 
cocainecaused health problems 
one of the reasons the program is underfinanced is because of 
health problems caused by the use of crack and cocaine which then 
leads to situations of increasing premature births which leads then 
to more expensive births said henry loubet vice president for 
maxicares northern california operations 
maintaining premature cocaine babies in intensive care can cost 
150000 each compared to the 2500 average cost for a normal 
pregnancy loubet said 
and state funding is inadequate loubet said in a threeyear 
period ending in 1988 health care costs rose 45 percent while 
state reimbursements jumped only 10 percent he said 
the company says it lost 15 million in 1988 on its 10 million 
contract with the state to provide health services to lowincome 
residents in the three counties and had projected a similar loss 
for 1989 
for example medical will pay 1000 for prenatal treatment of a 
pregnant woman and delivery of her child however the real cost is 
between 2500 and 4000 depending on the number of complications 
according to highland hospital director joyce berger 
the maxicare clinic in oakland and another one in san francisco 
will close jan 31 maxicare will lay off about 75 doctors and other 
employees 
the burlingame califbased company said it gave the state 120 
days notice of its cutbacks twice the required time 
for alameda county the crisis is magnified by the refusal of 
private doctors to accept medical patients because of low state 
reimbursements doctors are not legally required to accept medical 
patients 
the real problem is that theres no place for these people to 
go said county supervisor don perata who has urged a federal 
investigation into the adequacy of medical reimbursements our 
charge is that the state of california is failing to provide 
adequate access to health care to those individuals who are entitled 
to it 
however medical spokesman alan stolmack said alameda county 
health care services agency director david kears told him a county 
survey found enough resources existed to care for children being 
served by maxicare 
stolmack said medical is doing all it can to ease the crunch 
including searching for some of the 500000 the county has 
requested for expanding facilities and other transition costs tied 
to the maxicare pullout 
medical serves about 29 million patients in california with 
about 10 percent of those belonging to prepaid health care programs 
stolmack said 
meanwhile people such as brown are left to explain the cutbacks 
to the poor 
it feels really awful cause you sit in the room and say i 
really enjoyed taking care of you the clinics closing and we have 
to find you another doctor where do you want your records sent

a soviet weekly has revealed alarmingly high 
statistics on soviet suicides with more than 81000 soviets killing 
themselves in 1984 when only about 29000 americans took their own 
lives the same year 
the article in the latest edition of ogonyok magazine said 
however that the total number of soviet suicides had peaked in 1984 
and is now dropping a change it credited to the antidrinking drive 
championed by president mikhail s gorbachev 
in contrast suicides among soviet children are on the increase 
ogonyok said 
ogonyoks study on soviet suicide titled the final step 
was a dramatic illustration of the greater frankness in soviet media 
fostered by gorbachevs campaign for glasnost or greater 
openness 
statistics on suicide as well as other demographic data on the 
soviet population were once treated as state secrets and not 
mentioned by staterun media 
official data on soviet suicides were published in the 1920s by 
the governments department on moral statistics but the agency was 
abolished by dictator josef v stalin in the 1930s 
ogonyok said statistics on soviet suicides were revealed only 
several weeks ago in 1984 it said 81417 soviets killed 
themselves 
by comparison 29286 americans committed suicide that year 
according to the us centers for disease control in atlanta 
in 1985 the year gorbachev raised the drinking age from 18 to 
21 increased the price of vodka and cut alcohol production the 
number of soviet suicides dropped to 68073 the magazine said 
ogonyok said many suicide attempts were the result of drunkenness 
in 1986 there were 52830 suicides in the soviet union and 
54105 in 1987 ogonyok said 
us figures for those years were not available however 
according to centers for disease control statistics the us 
suicide rate rose from 119 suicides per 100000 people in 1980 to 
128 per 100000 in 1986 
ogonyok did not give the soviet suicide rate but another 
publication arguments and facts reported in june that the national 
suicide rate was around 20 per 100000 which works out to 
approximately 56000 suicides a year 
ogonyok said the number of suicides among young children and 
teenagers was growing much more rapidly than among the soviet 
adult population but it did not give statistics 
it said in most cases parents and teachers cannot explain why 
children who appear healthy and happy would take their own lives it 
said they seemed to put some of the blame on the privations of 
soviet life which may affect children more than adults 
if they adults try hard they even get used to the fact that 
they cant buy books in bookstores ogonyok said to teach this 
to children is even harder

defense secretary frank c carlucci said sunday 
that it would be devastating to the pentagon if the bush 
administration decided to accept automatic cuts mandated under the 
grammrudman deficit reduction law 
carlucci also repeated the reagan administrations refusal to 
comment in detail on the possibility of us military action against 
a suspected poison gas plant being constructed in libya 
i think the stories along those lines have been very much 
exaggerated the pentagon chief said on abcs this week with 
david brinkley 
asked if the united states was planning to bomb the libyan plant 
carlucci said im not going to answer a question based on 
military contingency plans any such answer might well put our 
people in jeopardy 
president reagan in his final budget sent to congress this past 
week requested 3152 billion a 2 percent increase after 
inflation for national defense in the 1990 fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 
there has been speculation that if the bush administration and 
congress fail to reach agreement on reducing the federal budget 
deficit the white house might be willing to accept automatic 
spending cuts imposed under the grammrudman legislation 
asked about this possibility carlucci said it would certainly 
be devastating to the defense department based on preliminary 
estimates wed have to take something like 26 billion out of the 
defense department 
our force structure is down to about the minimum you can get 
and still maintain our rotation schedules he said so cuts of 
those dimensions would really mean laying up ships getting rid of 
people taking away ammunition 
carlucci contended that reagans request for 2 percent real 
growth in defense spending was not out of line with the improved 
atmosphere of ussoviet relations 
on the contrary i think one can make a very credible case that 
the new relationship with the soviet union has come about because we 
have been negotiating from a position of strength he said and 
when youre on the verge of success you dont suddenly throw in 
your bargaining chips

jackets inscribed with the words camp david that are given to 
guests at the presidential retreat

hideaway for presidents since it was opened in 1943 during the 
administration of president franklin d roosevelt

in the washington area and did not have commitments which kept them 
in the capital 
when he was asked what he would miss about the white house 
reagan replied a lot of things the people have been so very 
kind and a very nice place to live 
reagans eight years in office will end friday with the

riot police used batons dogs and 
water cannons sunday to crush a rally commemorating the death 20 
years ago of a student who set himself afire to protest the 
sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia 
at least one person was badly injured and several others 
including members of a west german television crew were beaten by 
police wielding rubber truncheons 
ctk the czechoslovak state news agency denounced the rallies as 
a thwarted provocation and said 91 people were detained 
sirens wailed throughout central prague and several ambulances 
were seen as the crowds moved through the streets stopped 
repeatedly by riot police and water cannons 
some witnesses said tear gas also was used to break up the crowds 
of about 2000 who gathered in defiance of a ban on the independent 
rally other witnesses said it appeared canisters launched from 
police vans were smoke bombs not tear gas 
acrid smoke hung over many side streets near wenceslas square 
the rally site 
the action came just an hour after czechoslovakia became one of 
35 nations agreeing to a landmark human rights accord at the 
helsinki review conference in vienna 
ctk said police and peoples militia participated in preserving 
peace and order in the center of town after antistate elements 
attempted a provocation long prepared by western subversive 
centers 
police had been guarding wenceslas square since early saturday in 
an attempt to prevent people from attending the rally for jan 
palach who set himself afire on the square jan 16 1969 and died 
at the age of 20 
sovietled warsaw pact troops had invaded czechoslovakia in 
august 1968 to crush the communistled prague spring reforms 
police and militia units kept crowds moving on wenceslas square 
for at least an hour before the rally was scheduled to begin 
a crowd of 800 to 1000 moved toward the center of the square at 
about 145 pm shouting freedom freedom they sang the 
czechoslovak national anthem 
riot police carrying batons immediately moved in from side 
streets and started pushing the crowd back beating several people 
two people trying to help an elderly woman who fell in the melee 
were beaten by police 
demonstrators surrounded some policemen yelling for an ambulance 
for somebody they said was badly injured 
at the bottom of the square a halfmilelong boulevard in 
central prague about 1000 other people were kept behind metal 
barricades guarded by police 
about 10 minutes later three water cannons started spraying that 
crowd pushing the people down side streets 
police with dogs and batons had the top of the square cleared 
within about 20 minutes a police van circled the area advising 
people to clear it and announcing this is an unlawful gathering 
communist authorities on jan 6 said the rally intended by 
dissidents to be a simple and brief commemorative act could not be 
held 
but the charter 77 human rights movement and four other 
independent groups said they would go ahead with it anyway 
a western diplomat on the square said he saw leading charter 77

over the last week from an unknown committee for collective 
suicide threatening to emulate palachs act 
palachs body was secretly exhumed in 1973 from pragues olsany 
cemetery and reburied in his home village this has not prevented 
people from visiting the site of the prague grave 
on sunday dozens of people stopped at the grave site and left 
flowers or stuck candles into the soil which was streaked with 
colored wax

the chairman of the senate banking committee 
said sunday theres plenty of blame to go around including in 
congress for the crisis in the savings and loan industry that could 
cost taxpayers more than 100 billion 
sen donald riegle dmich whose committee will have to deal 
with the issue said there likely will have to be basic structural 
changes in the sampl industry he was not specific as to what changes 
he had in mind 
riegle appearing on nbcs meet the press said that while 
sampls must put their focus on providing home mortgages it would be 
an enormous shift backwards to require them to limit their 
activities to such mortgages 
some critics have argued that many of the problems facing sampls 
stems from the thrifts putting their money into speculative ventures 
such as questionable real estate deals instead of concentrating on 
providing relatively safe home mortgages 
riegle and william seidman chairman of the federal deposit 
insurance corporation who also was on the program agreed that 
failing sampls could cost the federal government between 85 billion 
and 105 billion in bailout money 
riegle said the sampl industrys problems are a shared 
responsibility and he blamed not only the industry and its 
regulators but also president reagan and congress 
the regulatory process broke down said riegle he added that 
the president shares responsibility and the congress for its 
part should have been more aggressive in coming to grips with the 
growing issue 
theres plenty of blame for everybody agreed seidman whose 
agency regulates the commercial banking industry and not the sampls 
he cited a relaxation of standards by federal regulators and failure 
of the administration and congress to provide resources to monitor 
the industry 
the rescue of 217 failing savings institutions cost the federal 
government 38 billion last year congress and the incoming bush 
administration will have to figure out how to pay the bill and deal 
with other rescues yet to come 
there are no pleasant answers here said riegle any answer 
we come to will be a painful one

the human capacity for language may come 
from a genetic mutation that occurred in a woman who lived in africa 
about 200000 years ago a researcher said sunday 
her descendants went on to colonize europe and asia perhaps 
aided by an ability to speak that had not yet appeared in humans in 
those areas said allan c wilson a biochemist at the university of 
california berkeley 
wilsons intriguing speculations about language are based on 
exhaustive comparisons of genetic material from people around the 
world 
two years ago wilson attracted the interest of scientists and 
the public when he concluded that all humans are descendants of a 
woman in africa who was inevitably dubbed eve 
wilson disdains that name for her because he notes that she was 
not the only woman alive at the time many others lived at the same 
time their descendants as it happened did not survive he said 
in a talk at the american association for the advancement of 
science wilson said new evidence including comparisons of human 
genetic materials with that of chimpanzees and apes strongly 
confirm that finding 
that assertion was strongly criticized by some anthropologists 
including milford wolpoff of the university of michigan who said 
evidence from fossils clearly and unambiguously contradicts it 
to buttress his theory wilson puzzled over what might have 
caused early humans in asia and europe to have died out leaving no 
descendants today 
he then became aware of research by luigi luca cavallisforza and 
colleagues at stanford university that suggested that language 
emerged about the same time as modern humans evolved in africa 
that led to the suggestion that eve and her african descendants 
could speak and their counterparts in asia and europe could not 
its likely they the europeans and asians could hear and make 
sounds but they didnt have modern language wilson said 
but why didnt the africans who colonized europe and asia mate 
with europeans and asians producing offspring who could speak and 
who would have continued the european and asian line of descendants 
until today 
wilson proposed that the mutation that somehow made language 
possible arose in a kind of genetic material called mitochondrial 
dna that is passed on only by mothers 
as africans invaded europe and asia only the children of african 
mothers would be able to speak and the african men would as 
colonizers likely prevent the african women from mixing with asian 
and european men 
any mixing between african men and european or asian women would 
result in mute children because only african mothers could pass on 
the language trait 
the advantages of being able to communicate ultimately may have 
enabled the africans to overrun the mute europeans and asians 
wilson said 
wilson admitted that this is a speculative notion this 
hypothesis is likely to inflame once again the controversy that 
erupted after he advanced the notion of an eve who was the 
mother of humankind

moscows recent readiness to disarm has 
boosted western hopes that new negotiations to reduce conventional 
arms in europe will enjoy more success than the 15yearold talks 
they replace 
nato and the warsaw pact initialed a mandate for negotiations on 
conventional armed forces in europe on saturday after a 
greekturkish dispute was solved by an ambiguous compromise 
unlike the inconclusive central european troop reduction talks 
the new negotiations demand full participation from all 16 nato 
countries and all seven warsaw pact nations countries whose troops 
were not involved held only observer status in the old talks 
the sole european country now excluded is albania the only 
european nation not to sign the 1975 helsinki final act 
western hopes for the new talks are based on the improved 
eastwest climate the successful conclusion of the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces talks and apparent willingness of 
the soviets and some of their allies to reduce military spending in 
favor of more and better consumer goods 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev gave the new talks a boost 
last month when he announced the unilateral reduction of half a 
million soviet troops over the next two years 50000 of them in 
east germany czechoslovakia and hungary 
last week budapest said the partial soviet withdrawal from 
hungary could begin within weeks hungary and poland also have said 
they will slash defense spending this year 
according to the mandate the new talks will cover conventional 
armed forces which include conventional armaments and equipment of 
the participants based on land within the territory of the 
participants in europe from the atlantic to the urals 
naval forces and chemical and nuclear weapons will not be 
addressed 
the text leaves unclear however whether the two military blocs 
will discuss socalled dual capable weapons which can carry 
both conventional and nuclear warheads 
us ambassador sten ledogar expressed cautious optimism about 
progress in the new negotiations scheduled to start in vienna 
around march 6 
statements of the east seem to be indicating that they are much 
more prepared now to come to grips with the problems of 
conventional disarmament ledogar told a news conference 
the new talks between the nato and warsaw pact nations will start 
at the same time as a 35nation conference on security and 
confidencebuilding measures in europe 
that forum follows up on an earlier meeting in stockholm which 
produced agreement on giving advance notification of major military 
maneuvers and sending nato and warsaw pact observers to watch them 
in fact the stockholm meeting achieved much more than the failed 
troops reduction talks which are to wind down within the six weeks 
before the new ones begin 
however ledogar said both sides learned a great deal from those 
negotiations for examaple the west in 1985 put to rest the 
divisive issue of how many troops each side had and concentrated on 
methods of verification 
conversely past agreements have allayed some of the communist 
leaderships fears about secrecy infringements through inspections 
stockholm and the inf treaty have brought into being regimes 
of rather intrusive verification ledogar noted 
a number of soviet bloc military men realized there is life 
after an inspection ledogar said 
he indicated the compromise in the turkishgreek dispute consists 
in leaving open the question of whether the eastern mediterranean 
region around mersin port eventually will be included or excluded in 
these negotiations greece had objected to the exclusion of the 
triangle of turkish territory close to the syrian border 
ledogar dismissed the turkishgreek issue as an insignificant 
problem which has no eastwest significance in bloctobloc 
negotiations 
according to the text of the mandate the objectives of the 
negotiations shall be to strengthen stability and security in europe 
through the establishment of a stable and secure balance of 
conventional armed forces which include conventional armaments and 
equipment at lower levels 
the talks also are aimed at eliminating disparities prejudicial 
to stability and the capability for launching surprise attacks 
and for initiating largescale offensive action

at age 72 george beshenich doesnt know the 
meaning of job burnout hes been performing as a fireeater for 
more than half a century and has no intentions of snuffing out what 
he considers a hot career 
i started out back in the days when carnivals and circuses were 
big time he said back then you could seriously consider 
fireeating as a vocation the same way people consider computer 
programming today 
precision is the key ingredient to eating fire according to 
beshenich whos better known as smokey george 
because of the moisture of the tissues in your mouth you can 
actually hold fire for a short time without any harm the 
pittsburgh resident said you can only take a flame in your mouth 
for about six to seven seconds and you have to learn how to judge 
that also you have to hold your breath 
beshenich learned the skill from another fireeater during a 
summer job with a carnival in 1932 
although beshenich has smoked cigarettes much of his life his 
doctor assures him his lungs are like a nonsmokers thats because 
hes never inhaled 
see i couldnt get in that habit because if you get 
absentminded and inhale just once with fire in your mouth itll be 
your last act said beshenich who performs at pittsburgh night 
spots im not joking when i say you cant afford burnout in my 
vocation

the soviet union is considering a plan 
to outfit a nuclearpowered spacecraft with three or four reactors 
in a twoyear manned mission to mars a soviet scientist said 
the reactors which would weigh 50 to 70 tons would heat 
hydrogen gas which then would be spewed from rocket nozzles va 
pavshuk of the soviet unions kurchatov institute of atomic energy 
said at a conference last week 
when not required for propulsion the reactors could be used to 
generate electricity by running turbines he said 
pavshuk was one of three soviet scientists to address a session 
of the university of new mexicos sixth annual symposium on space 
nuclear power systems the meeting ran monday through thursday 
it marked the first time in 25 years that us and soviet 
scientists have discussed their space nuclear power programs said 
nikolai ponomarevstepnoi first deputy director of the kurchatov 
institute 
the new york times reported sunday that the soviet scientists 
expressed interest in selling their new reactor technology to the 
west the newspaper quoted an unidentified american official as 
saying the soviet delegates had been privately hustling to sell 
space reactors and were apparently searching for an american agent 
to act as a middleman for sales to the west 
one delegate georgi m griaznov grinned as he told the audience 
at the conference even today we offered to sell you some of our 
products 
some experts said reactors such as those described by the soviets 
could be used to enable spy satellites to go into a higher orbit 
than other less powerful nuclear reactors used by soviets in 
existing satellites the newspaper reported higher orbits make the 
satellites less vulnerable to antisatellite weapons 
the united states also is developing nuclear reactors for 
satellites and the los alamos national laboratory developed a 
nuclear rocket engine similar to the one described by pavshuk 
during its rover program which ended in 1973 
the engine developed by the lab originally was conceived for use 
in intercontinental ballistic missiles but los alamos scientists 
later shifted their emphasis to interplanetary missions 
the westinghouse corp developed a flyable version of the rover 
engine ponomarevstepnoi joked that the soviets might have a need 
for westinghouses nuclear rocket test stand 
the soviets tested their new type of highpower nuclear reactor 
in space in 1987 and 1988 ponomarevstepnoi said 
the fuel elements of the thermionic reactor are clad with 
materials that convert reactor heat directly to electricity making 
them more compact and efficient than conventional designs 
the current us space reactor program sp100 features a 
reactor core that is separate from the elements that convert heat to 
electricity 
thermionic fuel elements have been studied for decades and 
continue to be evaluated at los alamos national laboratory

the number of black males enrolled in us 
colleges declined over the past decade even as minority enrollment 
in general was rising says a study released sunday 
black males also earned the fewest degrees and made the least 
progress in number of faculty positions held the american council 
on education said in its seventh annual status report on minorities 
in higher education 
the council reviewing department of education statistics found 
that black males represented 43 percent of college enrollment in 
1976 but their share had dropped to 35 percent by 1986 
during the same period total college enrollment grew from 11 
million to 125 million but black male enrollment fell from 470000 
to 436000 black women by contrast held a steady share throughout 
the period starting at 51 percent and ending at 52 percent 
while black enrollment has virtually stagnated asian and 
hispanic participation jumped 15 percent and 17 percent respectively 
from 1984 to 1986 fueling an 8 percent gain for minorities as a 
group said the report 
but the gains have not been adequate to improve overall standing 
of minorities in higher education for example only 5 percent of 
college students are hispanic 
in 1986 blacks made up 14 percent of the us population at 
large and hispanics made up 7 percent 
deborah j carter who coauthored the ace study with reginald 
wilson suggested that one reason the lack of more progress has been 
a shift in federal financial aid from mostly grants to mostly loans 
we know historically that blacks and other lowincome groups 
are much more reluctant to take out loans she said theyre not 
willing to take out a 5000 loan when their family income may be 
10000 
in their study wilson and carter cite a number of factors they 
say put black males at a particular disadvantage starting with 
elementary and secondary schools that have low expectations of them 
and give them little academic support 
poor elementary and secondary school preparation makes success 
in higher education difficult even for highly motivated students 
those who do manage to attend college find considerable racism and 
chilly environments on many white campuses the authors said 
carter continued what we find is that early on students make 
their choices as to whether they think theyre capable whether 
theres going to be money available we need to reach into our 
junior high schools and high schools to give students some incentive 
to hang in there and to make sure they take the kinds of courses 
they need 
both the ace study and a separate study issued by the joint 
center for political studies maintain that another reason for the 
decline in black enrollment might be attributed to a retreat in 
civil rights enforcement in higher education under the reagan 
administration 
where weve seen increases in enrollment like new jersey for 
example its because the state has taken the initiative said 
carter 
the joint center study by gary orfield a university of chicago 
professor says black enrollment peaked in 1980 at 11 million as a 
result of the governments commitment to enforcing civil rights 
during the late 1960s and the 1970s 
under reagan orfield said staffing for the education 
departments office of civil rights was cut by one fourth and its 
budget reduced 28 million he said career professionals have been 
severely demoralized by reagan appointees who were openly hostile 
to the enforcement goals they sought to pursue 
the office of civil rights was responsible for enforcing a 
federal court decision that ordered the government to enforce 
nondiscrimination policies in 10 states where there were segregated 
black and white state colleges 
orfield also charged that the administration deliberately 
blocked the flow of information from enforcement agencies that would 
otherwise have demonstrated the true extent of the retreat on civil 
rights

plo leader yasser arafat said sunday he 
is ready to begin international talks on middle east peace and he 
sought the help of this neutral nation to get peace moves started 
in a television interview on the eve of his arrival for an 
official visit arafat urged israel to respond to what he called the 
plo peace initiative but he charged that israel lacked strong 
leadership 
asked about israels readiness for direct peace talks under un 
supervision arafat said if they really mean that then i have 
said if there is an agreement on it lets start right away with 
international negotiations 
the chairman of the palestine liberation organization was 
interviewed by finnish state television at his tunisian headquarters 
before leaving for a twoday visit starting monday 
extra police patrols were in downtown helsinki and airport 
security procedures were tightened several days ago in preparation 
for arafats arrival 
plo officials here said arafat would seek to persuade finland to 
lead the european neutral countries in recognizing the state of 
palestine declared nov 15 by the plos parliamentinexile 
finland could have an important part in the peace negotiations 
because finland is known for its neutrality and its desire to work 
for peace everywhere arafat said 
zuheir al wazir director of the plos helsinki information 
office said the question of recognizing palestine will certainly 
be on the agenda of arafats talks 
finland and the other european neutral countries could take the 
initiative and follow the other countries which have already 
recognized the independent state of palestine he told the 
associated press 
the european neutrals are finland sweden switzerland and 
austria 
a finnish foreign ministry official briefing reporters at the 
outset of arafats twoday visit said finland cannot recognize 
states that have no internationally accepted borders even though 
helsinki welcomed the declaration of independence 
finland renewed a standing invitation to israels foreign 
minister last week after learning that arafat had agreed to visit 
helsinki 
the invitation to arafat issued last month reflected an 
apparent change in policy toward the plo leader who last month 
recognized israels right to exist and renounced terrorism 
plo policy has publicly changed in a reassuring way and many 
countries have noticed this so have we said the foreign ministry 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
arafats dec 15 declaration led to the lifting of a 13year ban 
by the united states on contacts with the plo las week britain 
sent its top foreign office expert on mideast affairs to tunis to 
meet arafat 
a senior plo official said the organizations dialogue with the 
united states will continue at its present level after 
presidentelect george bush takes office the kuwait news agency 
reported sunday 
the aim of this dialogue is to explore and understand the real 
us ideas opinions and trends the agency quoted khaled 
alhassan as saying in an interview with the kuwait daily alrai 
alaam he is a member of the plos central committee 
finland had considered inviting arafat in 1982 but rejected the 
idea arguing that finland recognized only states not organizations 
the foreign ministry official admitted that seven years ago it 
was not seen as politically justifiable or prudent to invite the plo 
chief 
the finns have a tradition of good connections with israel which 
kept an interest section in finlands embassy in moscow after the 
soviets severed diplomatic ties in 1967 
two year ago the finns held the first official meeting between 
israeli and soviet delegations a step toward reestablishing formal 
contacts 
officials said arafat would have formal talks with foreign 
minister kalevi sorsa he also was scheduled to meet prime minister 
harri holkeri and president mauno koivisto

in remarks after hirohitos death takeshita said the emperor had 
resolutely brought to an end the war that had broken out in spite 
of his wishes 
historians are divided on hirohitos war role and on whether he 
could have prevented the war 
as the world knows hirohito is the chief war criminal who 
unleashed the pacific war as the supreme ruler of japan the north 
korean news agency said in the englishlanguage report monitored in 
tokyo 
in particular he is a sworn enemy of the korean people for he 
was the chief criminal in enforcing the prolonged colonial rule of 
japanese imperialism over korea it said 
the news agency charged that takeshita was attempting to portray 
the emperor as an apostle of peace in order to justify 
continuing japanese militarism 
it also criticized japanese government control over school 
history textbooks and their portrayal of the countrys war role and 
visits by japanese officials to yasukuni shrine a shinto shrine 
honoring japans war dead 
newspapers in south korea this past week also criticized 
takeshitas remarks on thursday dozens of south korean students 
demonstrated in front of the japanese embassy in seoul demanding 
that takeshita apologize and some students attacked the nearby 
japanese cultural center with firebombs

the soviet union vowed sunday to 
continue supplying arms to the afghan government after soviet troops 
withdraw and expressed confidence kabul can successfully battle 
rebels an official report said 
the report seemed to signal a soviet intention to meet a feb 15 
un deadline for pulling out all its troops from afghanistan and 
it dampened speculation the soviets might drop support of kabuls 
marxist government 
if war is imposed on the afghan government it will be 
forced to counter this with force of arms and it has this force 
the official afghan news agency quoted soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze as saying 
the present regime has every opportunity to endure and in case 
the war goes on the soviet arms supplies will also be continued 
he was quoted as saying 
shevardnadze gave the interview which was also carried by the 
soviet news agency tass at the close of three days of intensive 
talks with afghan president najib and other government leaders the 
minister then left for moscow 
a pakistani foreign ministry spokesman asked to comment on 
shevardnadzes statement called it public posturing 
shevardnadze cannot come to kabul and say gentlemen we are 
going to ditch you so you make your own arrangements for survival 
the spokesman said at a news briefing 
pakistan and the united states support the guerrillas in their 
bid to topple the marxist government 
the pakistani spokesman speaking anonymously in line with 
goverment rules said his government is encouraging moscow and the 
afghan resistance based in pakistan and iran to negotiate again 
toward forming a broadbased government 
a meeting this month between the pakistanbased guerrillas and 
yuli vorontsov the soviet first deputy foreign minister and 
ambassador to afghanistan ended in stalemate when the resistance 
refused to allow najibs peoples democratic party of afghanistan in 
a future government 
the idea behind the current diplomatic flurry is to put a 
government in place in kabul that can prevent a bloodbath after a 
soviet pullout under terms of unmediated geneva accords signed in 
april 
resistance leader sibghatullah mojaddidi in iran sunday 
stressed the need for a united rebel alliance to avoid that 
situation 
before the russians leave our organization should form a 
government with a single leadership in order to avoid bloodshed 
later the islamic republic news agency reported quoted him as 
saying 
mojaddidi represents a sevengroup sunni moslem alliance in 
pakistan the guerrillas in iran are shiite moslem 
mojaddidi said the fall of the sovietbacked kabul government 
will automatically follow after the soviets withdraw their troops 
but he warned that the guerrillas must be able to fill that vacuum 
or face possible bloodshed the official iranian news agency said 
in his statement shevardnadze referred to the pullout of soviet 
troops saying we were and are convinced of the fact that 
afghanistan has patriotic forces capable of protecting on their 
own the gains of people and democratic institutions in the past few 
years the agency said 
western diplomats report that the final withdrawal of the 
remaining 50000 soviet troops began in earnest in early january 
guerrillas backed by pakistan and the united states control large 
areas of the countryside and are attacking supply convoys within a 
few miles of the capital 
in its report tass said the rebels were trying to cut the supply 
of necessities to the capital in an economic blockade 
the soviets moved in their forces nearly a decade ago after a 
sovietbacked marxist coup they eventually sent more than 100000 
troops but about half of them left already under the geneva accords

iraq has asked the international red cross 
to arrange for the repatriation of 200 sick and wounded iranian 
prisoners of war a red cross official said 
arnold luethold a deputy of the head of the red cross 
delegation told the associated press that iraqi officials have 
asked them to prepare for the release of the iranian pows and return 
them to iran 
we think this is a humanitarian gesture which could help to 
resume the pow exchange he said 
luethold said preparations are underway to charter a plane in 
switzerland to take the prisoners from iraq to iran 
the red cross official confirmed that the iraqis have not asked 
for any iraqi pows in exchange for the iranians 
iraqi leader saddam hussein last week decided to release a number 
of iranian prisoners equivalent to the number of participants in an 
islamic conference here that ended friday 
the islamic scholars appealed to him to make a goodwill gesture 
diplomatic sources here believe that the move could pave the way 
to resume the exchange of wounded pows which was halted nov 27 
after the two countries exchanged 155 iraqis and 56 iranians 
the two countries on aug 20 began a ceasefire in their 
8yearold war

libya said on sunday that nonaligned 
nations should support each other if attacked by a nation that is 
not a member of their movement 
the proposal was included in a paper submitted during a special 
confrerence of the nonaligned movement the 101member organization 
began meeting on friday to find ways of modernizing the group and 
increasing its effectiveness 
the libyan paper demanded the committment of member countries 
to provide political and material support to any counrty among them 
subjected to aggression from a state or states not belonging to the 
movement 
the paper also said member states should refuse to allow foreign 
forces to use their territory to attack another state 
the libyan demands appeared to be a direct appeal for support 
from the nonaligned movement against threatened us military 
action to neutralize a libyan factory allegedly built to manufacture 
chemical weapons 
libya accused the united states of unprovoked aggression 
following the jan 4 downing of two libyan fighters over the 
mediterranean by american jets 
the us defense department said the shooting was not related to 
the chemical factory and that the american jets attacked defensively 
when the libyan jets were about to attack 
libya has claimed the jets were unarmed and on a reconnaissance 
mission over international waters it claims the plant at rabta 
produces pharmaceuticals 
the nonaligned movement founded in 1961 initially was designed 
to represent countries that did not want to choose sides in the 
ussoviet superpower rivalry

west german experts who examined us 
evidence said they found no hard proof that a libyan plant was built 
to produce chemical weapons a newspaper reported sunday 
the conservative bonn newspaper die welt said sunday documents 
shown by us officials to the team of west germans last week failed 
to show the plant in rabta 60 miles southwest of the capital 
tripoli was definitely intended to manufacture poison gas 
however die welt said bonn officials were not denying news 
reports last week that us intelligence agencies intercepted 
telephone conversations of libyan officials in august asking west 
german chemical companies for help in cleaning up a chemical spill 
in rabta 
the newspaper telexed its report to news agencies in advance of 
its publication monday 
chief government spokesman friedhelm ost said saturday the us 
information indicates a number of german firms as well as 
companies from several nations made deliveries for the libyan 
chemical plant but that officials had not found evidence to 
warrant prosecution 
a preliminary evaluation of the documents provided by the 
americans shows that the material is nothing beyond what we already 
know about so far and would not stand up in court ost said in a 
statement 
the two west german companies under investigation are 
imhausenchemie of lahr and the nowdefunct ibi engineering of 
frankfurt 
in newspaper interviews published sunday in britain and west 
germany ibi owner ihsan barbouti was quoted as saying he doubted 
the libyans were producing chemical weapons in rabta 
they were the first published interviews of barbouti since he was 
publicly linked to the plant 
i was there five years and nobody had ever mentioned that it 
was a poison gas factory the west berlin newspaper morgenpost 
quoted barbouti as saying all the blueprints for the 
pharmaceutical factory were all over the office everyone could see 
them 
barbouti a 61yearold iraqi architect who lives in london was 
quoted as saying he received a contract from the libyans to build a 
large manufacturing complex but that the plant in question was built 
separately by the libyans 
i believe firmly that they the libyans as far as i know did 
not produce poison gas while i was there and are not producing it 
now he was quoted as saying 
barbouti was also quoted as saying that companies from west 
germany japan denmark yugoslavia belgium italy and france 
delivered equipment for the rabta complex 
in his interview with the observer newspaper of london barbouti 
was quoted as saying the complex was to include a foundry a plastic 
molding workshop maintenance and engineering workshops and storage 
hangars for libyas vast imports 
barbouti was quoted as saying the libyans decided in 1985 to add 
a pharmaceutical factory to the site so that they could make their 
own drugs under license 
i saw a plan to produce around 50 different drugs he was 
quoted as saying 
when asked who built the pharmaceutical plant he was quoted as 
saying the libyans themselves

the street drug known as pcp or angel 
dust can protect against damage to the brain following a heart 
attack or stroke researchers said sunday 
specially designed drugs that can impart this beneficial 
protection without causing the mental disruption that pcp produces 
could be in use within five to 10 years the researchers said at the 
annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of 
science 
such drug relatives are often referred to as designer drugs 
because they are carefully designed by pharmacologists to mimic some 
but not all of the properties of a known drug 
angel dust known technically as pcp or phencyclidine is both a 
stimulant and a depressant and it induces a psychiatric state 
similar to schizophrenia 
dr edward f domino of the university of michigan in ann arbor 
who has studied pcp extensively said that at least seven classes of 
designer drugs produce effects similar to pcp 
one is an anesthetic called ketamine that is rarely used in the 
united states but used frequently in the third world because it is 
easier to administer 
it produces some of the same disorienting symptoms as does pcp 
but the symptoms dont last as long domino said and they can be 
controlled with tranquilizers 
ketamine shares the ability of pcp to protect the brain when it 
has been deprived of oxygen as can happen during a heart attack or 
stroke 
a drug related to ketamine could be given to heart attack or 
stroke patients or to people about to undergo surgery to prevent 
serious brain damage domino said 
the national institute on drug abuse is encouraging research in 
the development of safer versions of ketamine and pcp domino said

champions of his reforms but not three members of the ruling

reserved for deputies directly elected by social organizations such 
as the communist party and trade unions 
the other twothirds are to be filled by march 26 public 
elections to choose deputies from the 15 soviet republics and their 
electoral districts

expected to be members of the communist party the only legal 
political party in the soviet union 
the elections the first under political reforms championed by 
gorbachev are to be open to an unlimited number of candidates

list except ukrainian party boss vladimir v shcherbitsky foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze and russian federation president 
vitaly i vorotnikov

against south africa and providing direct financial support to 
black south africans who bear the brunt of suffering in that 
troubled land 
mrs king urged bush to put behind the politics of the past 
by addressing several issues during his term of office affordable 
housing a steppedup war on drugs and racial violence and the 
appointment of federal judges who are as tough on discrimination 
as they are on street crimes 
king born jan 15 1929 was assassinated april 4 1968 at age 
39 on the balcony of a motel in memphis tenn his killer james 
earl ray is in prison

children when he was away who got sad sometimes who could be a 
perfect friend said helen maybell anglin who runs a restaurant 
in chicago another soul food restaurant of hers the nowdefunct 
hamph cafe which was one of kings favorite chicago eateries 
even as supporters of king celebrated his spirit some warned 
that the civil rights movement has grown lethargic others said that

there is a clear and present danger that the dream of dr 
martin luther king jr is at risk of being derailed the rev

the establishment of a federal national holiday has seduced us 
into becoming comfortable with martin luther king walker told

jesus and said king was the only authentic spiritual genius that 
western religion has produced 
hazel dukes president of the new york state conference of 
branches of the naacp said king would be very disappointed with 
us 
he would be saddened to see how we have lost the fervor of us 
coming together the races of people jews and gentiles white and 
black she said 
in a speech at a harlem church to about 1500 people the rev 
jesse jackson said that too many young blacks have a misconceived 
notion of what their civil rights are he chastised youngsters who 
think it is their constitutional right to take illegal drugs 
that is a civil wrong dr king did not die for your right to 
sniff cocaine and crack and heroin stay the dream dont betray the 
dream jackson said

a former israeli intelligence official believes a 
palestinian group headed by reputed terror mastermind abu ibrahim 
blew up pan am flight 103 over scotland last month a newspaper said 
sunday 
the sunday post of scotland quotes former mossad officer raphael 
eitan as saying he had no doubt the bombers were ibrahims 
iraquibased may 15 palestinian group and that the bomb was made 
there and probably carried on board the boeing 747 by an unwitting 
accomplice 
the crash killed 270 people over lockerbie scotland 
the may 15 group has offices in syria and libya as well as the 
iraqi capital eitan was quoted as saying 
they are led by abu ibrahim a qualified engineer eitan was 
quoted as telling the newspaper in the early days ibrahim 
received all his financial support from iraqi intelligence who 
continue to provide him with cash and premises 
may 15 has only 20 to 30 operatives who concentrate their 
terrorist efforts on passenger airlines eitan was quoted as 
saying 
may 15 was the only palestinian with the expertise to carry out 
such attacks eitan was quoted as saying ibrahim spent five years 
designing and perfecting the device which exploded over lockerbie 
he was quoted as saying 
eitan who said he had been involved in investigating 
boobytrapped suitcases since 1984 was quoted as saying 
ibrahims detonator is so small it fits into the lock of the 
suitcase the explosive is made of plastic not necessarily semtex 
this plastic is extremely thin and looks like computer printout 
paper so it is easily concealed 
in the past four years he has failed several times to carry out 
a similar atrocity eitan was quoted as saying in 1984 british 
and west german intelligence intercepted five suitcases packed with 
explosives which may 15 intended to plant on unsuspecting airline 
passengers two were found in london two were found in frankfurt 
asked to respond to the report a spokeswoman at scotland yard 
police headquarters said she could not comment on security matters 
police in lockerbie also had no comment 
the newspaper also quotes ian geldard of the institute for the 
study of terrorism in london as saying may 15 certainly were the 
principals in the earlier attempts to plant plastic explosives on 
passenger jets 
eitan headed the secret israeli defense ministry unit that 
supervised jonathan pollard an american civilian employee of the 
us navy who was sentenced to life in prison in march 1987 for 
selling classified military documents to israel 
the episode was a blow to usisrael relations and eitan left 
his intelligence post after pollards 1985 arrest he was given the 
job of chairman of israeli chemicals ltd the largest stateowned 
company 
investigators have determined that flight 103 was bombed and an 
international police effort is under way to track down the 
terrorists responsible 
the londonbased sunday express reported this week that 
investigators were looking into the possibility that a us soldier 
unknowingly took the bomb aboard the jetliner 
the newspaper said british and us investigators were acting on 
us government reports that some us soldiers had been approached 
in west german nightclubs and offered thousands of dollars to carry 
diamonds to new york the paper said the soldiers instead may have 
unwittingly carried the bomb 
a us defense department spokesman said in washington late 
saturday night he had no information about the report 
another newspaper the sunday telegraph said the investigation 
was being hampered by the recovery of baggage from the wreckage 
which cannot be matched with anyone on board the plane 
it said scotland yards antiterrorist squad also believed 
luggage belonging to passengers who died was mistakenly placed on 
other flights 
the newspaper said police matching luggage to passengers is 
essential to tracing the bombers 
scotland yard had no comment on the sunday telegraphs report

demonstrators carried a black coffin 
bearing the initials of the ruling sandinista party as thousands 
marched to protest policies they blame for civil war and a shattered 
economy 
we dont want arms we want bread read one placard 
opposition united against hunger misery and corruption 
proclaimed a banner 
nicaragua suffers inflation of more than 20000 percent and 
shortages of most consumer goods including food staples 
fourteen opposition parties several unions and private business 
representatives joined in the march called to commemorate the 1978 
assassination of newspaper editor pedro joaquin chamorro 
his death galvanized opposition to anastasio somozas 
dictatorship toppled the next year by the leftist sandinistas 
usbacked rebels known as contras have been fighting the 
sandinistas since 1982 
sundays event turned into a huge antisandinista demonstration 
drawing an estimated 5000 people no violence was reported 
each party has its own program but were united against the 
sandinista government said carlos huembes president of the 
nicaraguan democratic coordinating committee which called the 
demonstration 
president daniel ortega addressed a crowd of several thousand 
government supporters less than a mile away at about the same time 
explaining a new austere economic policy that involved layoffs 
he said that the state would lay off about half its workers 
estimated now to number about 80000 there would be no cuts in 
police he said on dec 31 he had said that the defense budget 
would be cut 40 percent 
the 1989 budget was delayed and is still being considered by the 
national assembly 
opposition demonstrators came by truck and bus from outlying 
towns and huembes said the government turned back some buses and 
threatened truck drivers with fines 
demonstrators complained about economic conditions saying they 
were not earning enough money to pay for food much less clothing 
and medicine 
we cant afford beer and before it was so cheap it was like 
they were giving it away said one construction worker sporting a 
battered marlboro cap he said he earned 4000 cordobas about 80 
cents a day and needed 2000 to buy a liter of milk for his 
children 
and tomorrow it will be 4000 said his wife referring to 
nicaraguas spiraling inflation both refused to give their names 
for fear of government retaliation 
a nearly yearlong series of currency devaluations and increases 
in the governmentset price of fuel and transport aimed at 
stabilizing the economy have instead yielded even higher consumer 
prices 
ortega blames nicaraguas economic plight on the war against the 
contras and on the battering the nation got in october from 
hurricane joan 
thats political talk they are killing us with hunger but they 
dont want to blame themselves said an 81yearold man wearing a 
straw hat 
a truce has been in place since march but the sandinistas still 
consider the country to be in a state of war 
the 3hour march began with a mass for chamorro then winded its 
way almost two miles through a western part of the city to the 
cemetery where he is buried the caravan stopped periodically so the 
many politicians involved could address the crowd 
a lot of people didnt come because they were afraid said 
alberto borge who said he wasnt marching but was watching in 
solidarity 
he said he had once been a sandinista but no more and 
identified himself as a cousin of the powerful interior minister 
tomas borge 
the government issued a permit for the march and opposition 
leaders denied accusations that they accepted money from the us 
embassy for the march 
it was the largest demonstration against the government since a 
protest in the town of nandaime on july 10 
police used tear gas and clubs to break up the nandaime 
demonstration and arrested 40 opposition leaders 
chamorro was publisher of the newspaper la prensa his 
assassination on january 10 1978 galvanized opposition to the 
somoza dictatorship 
la prensa published by one of chamorros sons is now the 
leading newspaper opposed to the sandinista government 
the sunday march was also dedicated to luis medrano a union 
leader killed about a year later as he passed out leaflets inviting 
passersby to a memorial service for chamorro

heading to the windup of a 35nation 
human rights conference secretary of state george p shultz called 
on the soviet union sunday to uproot its facilities for jamming 
western radio broadcasts 
the soviets and their east european allies stopped jamming radio 
liberty and radio free europe late last year and shultz said 
generally their societies were now more open 
he told reporters aboard the us air force jet that carried him 
to vienna for his last diplomatic mission that i think we have 
seen deeds 
but shultz said before a refueling stop here what we now will 
be pushing for and insisting on is a continuation of these deeds 
in vienna shultz will participate with foreign ministers of 34 
other countries in the conclusion of a 27month review of the 
helsinki agreement 
signed by the united states canada the soviet union and 32 
european countries in 1975 it called for a reduction of eastwest 
tensions and a broader exchange of people and ideas 
in helsinki shultz said the diplomacy was way ahead of 
the reality gradually the reality has moved toward what we set out 
as the objective it has a long way to go but we now have a process 
of movement 
shultz who will leave office friday with the end of the reagan 
administration seemed confident the incoming bush administration 
would keep pressure on moscow 
we will keep attention on this subject continuously he said 
for his part shultz called on the soviets to dismantle the giant 
transmitters used to jam western radio broadcasts and to tear down 
the berlin wall 
we think the practice by which you jam should be dismantled so 
you cant start it up again he told a halfdozen reporters taking 
this final trip with him 
shultz called the concrete and barbedwire wall which surrounds 
west berlin keeping east germans from fleeing the acid test in 
the human rights area 
until that wall comes down its just there shultz said 
and it is more than a symbol it tells you by its very presence 
that you still have a long way to go 
shultz seemed taken aback by published reports that the new 
administration of presidentelect bush questioned a decision to hold 
a human rights conference in moscow in 1991 
the decision was taken by president reagan on shultzs 
recommendation it was based on several steps taken by the soviets 
including the release of more than 600 political prisoners the 
reunification of more than 100 families and increased jewish 
emigration 
i certainly havent heard a word from anyone in the bush 
administration he said its obviously a question of some 
judgment 
he said that by setting conditions for the soviets including 
free access by all citizens to the conference we managed to help 
along the process quite a bit 
shultz said that he had frequent foreign sessions with his 
designated successor james a baker iii including a two and 
onehalf hour meeting saturday at bakers home where the incoming 
secretary of state is recuperating from the flu

china on monday acknowledged that a senior 
vietnamese official was in beijing for talks on cambodia the issue 
that for the past decade has deeply divided the two socialist 
neighbors 
china in the past has said it would not hold direct talks with 
hanoi until vietnam removes its troops fighting chinabacked 
resistance forces in cambodia 
first deputy foreign minister of vietnam dinh nho liem arrived 
in beijing on jan 14 for private consultations with chinese vice 
foreign minister liu shuqing on a political settlement of the 
cambodian question the foreign ministry said in a statement 
eastern european sources said liems visit the first by a 
highranking vietnamese official in more than nine years could pave 
the way for a meeting between chinas foreign minister qian qichen 
and his vietnamese counterpart nguyen co thach 
the vietnamese embassy in beijing would say only that liem will 
be talking about bilateral relations and matters of mutual concern 
liems arrival saturday night was not reported by the chinese 
media and his welcoming venue was changed to beijings old airport 
which is used for highlevel diplomatic visits in an apparent 
effort to evade foreign journalists who had learned he was on a 
commercial flight from bangkok 
relations between beijing and hanoi crumbled after vietnams 
late1978 invasion of cambodia to drive the prochinese khmer rouge 
from power china launched a 20day border war against vietnam in 
1979 to punish the vietnamese for its military actions in 
cambodia 
china is the main arms supplier to the khmer rouge and other 
resistance groups in cambodia 
foreign minister qian in a news conference in paris saturday 
repeated chinas stand that cambodia is the major obstacle blocking 
improved relations with vietnam and said vietnam must take the 
initiative by withdrawing its troops as soon as possible 
however in recent months china has taken a more conciliatory 
stand on some aspects of the cambodian conflict in an apparent 
effort to expedite the peace process 
in august china opened direct talks with the soviet union 
vietnams main financial supporter on cambodia and now says enough 
progress has been made to hold the first chinesesoviet summit in 30 
years 
previously china said moscows backing of vietnams occupation 
of cambodia was the main obstacle to normalization of chinesesoviet 
relations 
china also has given assurances that it does not support the 
return to power of the khmer rouge blamed for the deaths of 1 
million cambodians during their brutal 197578 rule it has said it 
is willing to reduce its assistance to the khmer rouge and other 
guerrilla forces as vietnam pulls out 
china has called for the formation of a coalition government 
headed by resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk and including 
the vietnambacked heng samrin faction 
sihanouks son prince ranariddh said last week that china had 
agreed to hold direct talks with vietnam at the urging of the soviet 
union which says it favors an early settlement in cambodia 
including a vietnamese pullout 
vietnam claims it has about 50000 troops in cambodia and has set 
a target of september for total withdrawal china says previous 
vietnamese withdrawals were mere troop rotations but has said the 
setting of the september target date was a step forward

you merely have to be black in the wrong neighborhood or even 
its the right neighborhood jackson said in a news conference 
sunday we were there five minutes we had just gotten off the 
freeway 
he said that he arranged the sting fully in commemoration of 
the efforts of martin luther king jackson said that really is 
what gave me the courage to do this the slain civil rights leader 
would have been 60 on sunday 
jackson who belongs to a group called police misconduct lawyer 
referral service said he was told police frequent a strip of the 
pacific coast highway in this city 20 miles south of los angeles 
about 1130 pm saturday jackson and a friend were driving in 
that area at martin luther king boulevard when police stopped their 
car claiming that it was straddling lanes said jackson 30 who 
was a passenger in the vehicle driven by an offduty corrections 
officer 
jackson alleged that officer mark dickey slammed his head through 
the window and painfully pulled one of his fingers back 
next he took me to the back of the car and slammed my head 
into the trunk of the car jackson alleged then he ordered me 
to spread my feet out he kicked my legs as hard as he could 
authorities deny that dickey pushed jacksons head through the 
storefront but are investigating the allegations said lt mike hill 
were going to conduct a complete and thorough investigation 
he said 
police booked jackson for investigation of interfering with 
police and challenging a police officer they set his bail at 
12000 then reduced it to 250 and finally released jackson on his 
own recognizance more than six hours later 
he said he plans to file a personnel action with police against 
dickey and a lawsuit against the department 
david lynn of the lawyer referral service said long beach 
residents have filed 50 misconduct complaints against city police 
officers of those 27 were filed by black people and 24 of those 
cases involved white police officers he said 
jackson was involved in a similar sting last february at an 
upscale shopping area in los angeles where he was arrested after 
allegedly refusing an officers request to move along

cars he said 
government officials immediately appointed a commission to 
investigate the crash some railway officials said operators may not 
have known how to work a signaling system installed on tuesday

and others cautioned that such improvements often are small 
the jury is still out on whether positive thinking and other

the city londons equivalent of wall street is 
suffering another wave of cutbacks reflecting persistently sluggish 
trading low stock prices and smaller profits at brokerages 
further cuts are expected in coming months and weaker firms have 
become targets of takeover speculation 
the retrenchment the third in two years has dented many 
investment firms ambitious plans of becoming powerful global 
traders 
it also has crimped britains flamboyant new breed of yuppies 
who came to symbolize prime minister margaret thatchers capitalist 
revolution with flashy sports cars swanks suits and champagne 
the investment firms are suffering from the intense competition 
following big bang the 1986 deregulation of britains financial 
markets which attracted new international players the firms also 
have been clobbered by the october 1987 stock market crash which 
scared many investors 
their margins have narrowed sharply and few if any are believed 
to be making money 
analysts estimate that between 1000 and 3000 jobs have been cut 
in the recent wave bringing the number of cuts since big bang to an 
estimated 10000 estimates of the number of employees in the city 
range from 250000 to 450000 
although not unexpected the recent cuts still were a nasty shock 
there were the sob stories and the hard luck stories said 
simon coombe a banking analyst at the london investment firm ubs 
phillips and drew 
he added that for sacked traders hunting new jobs the most 
important thing now is not the salary being offered but the length 
of contract being offered security is very obviously more on 
peoples minds these days 
the first wave of cuts came soon after big bang when the firms 
quickly realized there were too many players chasing too little 
money the second followed the crash and the third was prompted by 
the firms usual yearend review of results 
its the time of year that people look back at the numbers they 
made in the previous year and look ahead at their budget coombe 
said 1988 was a year that most securities firms didnt make a lot 
of money 1989 doesnt look all that much better 
big increases in british interest rates in the second half of 
1988 have also hurt the stock market said banking analyst chris 
smith of barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
some firms have pulled out of marketmaking in equities or 
british government bonds called gilts or both or they have cut 
back the number of equities in which they make markets 
the gilts market also has been hurt by the conservative 
goverments tight fiscal spending policy britain is enjoying a rare 
budget surplus and the government is repaying debt 
marketmakers are the specialist brokers who continuously quote 
prices in certain stocks on the london markets computerized trading 
system 
people are trying to improve their profitability coombe 
said one of the ways to improve profitability when revenue is not 
going to increase is to cut costs 
morgan grenfell plc made the biggest cuts in the recent wave when 
it withdrew from marketmaking in equities and gilts slashing 450 
of its 3000 jobs in december 
the firm said it lost 403 million in the first 11 months of the 
year from such trading 
ironically marketmaking was an activity the traders had sought 
and won under big bang previously it was restricted to 17 special 
firms called jobbers 
the number of marketmakers soared to 61 after big bang and 
since has receded to 51 
the average daily value of equities trading on londons stock 
exchange stood at 31 billion in november well below a july 1987 
peak of 54 billion 
big bang which occurred in october 1986 also abolished minimum 
commissions allowed banks to enter the securities business and 
permitted foreign firms to join londons stock exchange 
the exchange introduced computer systems allowing dealers to 
trade off the stock exchange floor using phones and screens 
american firms which had geared up especially aggressively for 
big bang also have cut back 
among them security pacific corps london unit announced early 
in january it was pulling out of marketmaking in gilts and 
eurobonds cutting 135 of its 1400 london jobs chase manhattan 
bank na said it was withdrawing from marketmaking in british 
equities cutting 135 of 2500 britishbased jobs 
japanese firms had proceeded more cautiously and havent 
publicly announced any massive layoffs 
the number of major trading firms in london is expected to shrink 
over the next few years from more than two dozen now to three or 
four with smaller participants establishing niches 
the most widely held belief is as old darwin said the fittest 
will survive coombe said

in the united states mitsubishi sells the 
montero in japan its the pajero mazda markets the 626 here the 
same as the capella back home a bmw 750il is a 750il no matter 
where its sold 
putting a name on a car is a special mission sometimes carrying 
special considerations for the us market whats in a name can 
lead to bewilderment and as in at least two cases lawsuits 
the united states is by far the largest car and light truck 
market in the world a money pool foreign automakers cannot ignore 
that includes toyota which sold more than 616000 japanmade cars 
in the united states last year and sterling which sold fewer than 
9000 cars in 1988 
the american carbuyer is different from others especially 
europeans who own fewer cars and are more discriminating in what 
they want said bill wilcox a car marketing plans manager at ford 
motor co 
europeans are much more able to deal with we have found 
alphanumeric designations for car names he said whereas the 
majority of people drive here but a very small percent know what 
they have in their car 
john maton who sells bmw and mercedesbenz autos in ann arbor 
said theres confusion if theyre new customers and dont 
understand the significance of a cars name 
of all imports those two west german makers may have the most 
systematic approach to badging their cars the designations 
indicate characteristics size of the car and its engine 
for example the topoftheline bmw 750il is a 7series the 
7 car with a 50liter the 50 fuelinjected the i 
engine on a long the l wheelbase 
all automakers selling worldwide spend lots of time and money 
researching names it doesnt always spare them problems 
toyota motor corp is in federal court battling mead data central 
inc over the use of the name lexus for the auto companys new line 
of luxury cars designed strictly for us sale mead claims lexus 
waters down the name of its legal information retrieval service 
lexis 
lexus spokesman kurt von zumwalt said among the 600 or so names 
toyota officials in the united states and japan started with was 
alexis 
we took that and a few other names that were on the list and 
inhouse formed a committee he said as a result of that 
committee the word lexus was developed with the idea that it 
connoted luxury and high technology which were the two images that 
we wanted to create 
the company conducted us and international trademark searches 
and found the similarity with meads lexis toyota attorneys figured 
there would be no problem 
they were mistaken 
last april 22 after negotiations mead data sued toyota in 
federal court in new york a hearing is scheduled for jan 30 until 
then toyota can continue limited use of the lexus name the two 
models were unveiled at the north american international auto show 
here last week 
von zumwalt said toyota has no regrets over its name choice 
besides it has spent millions on development and promotion of the 
lexus name 
hindsight is always perfect he said by the time mead said 
we are going to sue we were into it too far 
general motors corp also is in court over the name of one of its 
chevrolets the beretta the italian weaponsmaker beretta claims 
trademark infringement that suit also is pending in new york 
the name of mitsubishis pajero a sportutility vehicle made and 
sold in japan was changed to the montero for us distribution in 
part because the word appeared vaguely spanish some consumers 
therefore may pronounce the j as an h spokesman shane smith 
said 
he also said the japanese name wasnt as an aggressive a name 
as the competition like nissans pathfinder or fords bronco 
beyond that he said montero is easier to pronounce for 
americans 
one of the names thats no trouble for americans to pronounce is 
sterling an upscale car made in the united kingdom and distributed 
through austin rover cars of north america 
the sterling name said marketing director dave huyett gave 
tremendous connotations to what the car should be luxury prestige 
and high end 
it was a natural he said

ada maxwell stood next to the chrysler millennium 
wondering if an alien should be at the wheel 
it looks like it came from outer space the detroit woman 
said shaking her head 
the milennium one of more than a dozen concept cars was 
displayed at the north american international auto show which 
closed sunday in detroit the handbuilt oneofkind vehicles drew 
skeptical glances from some showgoers and more studied appraisals 
from others 
chrysler corp bills the millennium as its safetyr automobiles on 
the road it has air bags antilock brakes and 
a heated windshield 
but it has some other things too that arent on the road 
including voiceactivated controls infrared beams to pick out 
objects in front of the car in the dark of night and collision 
warning radar some of the stuff on todays jet planes 
thats a testbed kind of car chrysler spokesman ben dunn 
said that car as it sits would never reach production but 
elements of it would 
ever since car makers had design studios there have been concept 
or dream cars its one way to test ideas on the public 
recent technology has made assembly lines more flexible making 
it possible for engineering manufacturing and other carmaking 
experts to become involved early in the design process that has 
resulted in concept cars taking on a decidedly road worthy and 
marketable look 
one of the concept cars close to production is the buick park 
avenue essence gill davenport a project coordinator for the 
essence said a version of it could be ready for the road in the 
1993 or 1994 model year 
mainly this car was put together to give people a feeling that 
this was an extension of home he said while standing next to the 
shiny aquamarine car 
some homey touches include a superthin 5inch color television 
set dropping down from the roof for rearseat passengers and 
separate sound systems with headphones for each of the passengers 
its fantastic the color the style said thelma paulausky 
of taylor a buick owner who said shed like to have an essence 
other concept cars at the show while unique arent nearly as 
close to making it to the road as is the essence 
the ford splash and the plymouth speedster are tiny twoseaters 
with a decidedly southern california look seats are covered in 
neoprene the same material used in wet suits 
i could just see a zillion of them in california betty 
schreiber of detroit said of the speedster she said she like

green 
it looks like a lego toy mike krol of detroit said while 
standing next to her and the speedster display 
over at the ford truck exhibit where the splash was displayed 
model leah murray said people asked frequently about the cars 
suspension and its upholstery 
it looks like it can go under water said murray costumed in 
a wet suit they always ask if its in production and when it will 
be coming out 
like plymouth ford has not announced plans to produce the car 
the dodge viper rt 10 is a concept car that has a familiar look 
to sports car enthusiasts to some like john koss of rochester it 
has lines similar to the shelby cobra 
unlike many concept cars the interior of the viper is spartan 
there is no tv no elaborate sound system or separate climate 
controls dials and gauges are reminiscent of roadsters 25 years old 
this is getting back to basics said koss looking over the 
fireengine red car with chromed exhaust pipes running along the 
rocker panels under the doors 
jazzy styling common to concept cars certainly isnt lost on the 
luxury end of the market displayed beside traditional sedan de 
villes and fleetwoods is the cadillac solitare a deep burgundy 
number that got its share of attention at the show 
the classic cadillac front end with the wellknown crest is 
gone from the solitare something that disappointed wally mazer of 
westland mich 
theyre going out of their class he said when asked if he 
could see himself behind the wheel of a solitare mazer said without 
hesitating 
oh no im retired

boston cos profits for the first three quarters 
of 1988 were overstated by 30 million more than twice as high as 
preliminary estimates officials with the investment firm said 
a spokesman for shearson lehman hutton inc boston cos parent 
firm said friday a committee of outside auditors and shearson 
officers arrived at the higher estimate after an examination of 
bostons financial position 
the spokesman thomas schick said the committee was trying to 
determine who was responsible for the overstatement and probably 
would reach a decision within a few weeks 
at the moment no conclusions have been reached as regards 
assignment of responsibility and as a result there is no decision 
on personnel matters schick said 
three top boston co officers were suspended last month 
discrepancies in the investment firms financial reports 
shearson declined to name the three officers who were suspended 
with pay when the overstatement was disclosed they have been 
identified by newspapers as president james n von germeten 
executive vice president joseph f murphy and chief financial 
officer michael j walsh 
shick said the overstatement involved no misuse of company or 
client funds and we do not believe that any laws were broken 
he said the overstatement resulted primarily from deferred 
booking of expenses and to a lesser extent accelerated or early 
recording of revenue 
the reviews conclusion was that what was involved here was 
accounting decisions that would boost the reported earnings he 
said in terms of what the motive was i cannot possibly speak to 
that 
shick said the overstatement was 44 million in pretax or 30 
million in posttax income he said shearson would not divulge the 
companys actual earnings but that boston co would be profitable 
in the fourth quarter and for the full year would achieve the 
third highest earnings level in its history 
boston co is the parent company of boston safe deposit amp trust 
co the nations 17th largest bank with more than 11 billion in 
deposits 
the company also runs a family of mutual funds and is a major 
manager of pension funds it has a total of about 35 billion in 
assets under management

mai basic four the small california computer 
company bidding to take over much larger prime computer inc for 
970 million has overcome initial skepticism on wall street and is 
now considered by securities analysts and arbitrageurs to have an 
excellent chance of success 
despite court battles that still could block the tender offer 
some securities analysts say the game is over 
it would appear to be a done deal which is what the arbitrage 
community has been saying by bidding up the price of the stock 
robert herwick who follows prime for hambrecht amp quist said 
friday these folks at mai have done the unbelievable 
when tustin califbased mai basic controlled by new york 
investor bennett s lebow launched the 20pershare offer on nov 
15 many wall street professionals did not take it seriously 
underlying the early skepticism was uncertainty about the 
strength of lebows investment banker drexel burnham lambert inc 
which was under investigation in the wall street insider trading 
scandal 
in addition disclosure filings that accompanied the bid said mai 
basic had previously offered to sell itself to prime which had 
shown little interest 
when mai basic turned around and made the offer to buy prime 
initially everyone just thought it was a backdoor way of trying to 
sell itself and they just laughed said one new york arbitrageur 
who declined to be quoted by name 
but mai pursued the bid vigorously and drexel burnham lambert 
moved last month to settle the allegations against it by pleading 
guilty to six unspecified felonies and paying a record 650 million 
fine 
now the general feeling is drexel is going to come back roaring 
and try to prove its mettle said the arbitrageur its really 
drexels desire to come back from all that confusion that makes this 
deal credible 
stockholders also have been effectively casting ballots for the 
offer by tendering their shares of prime which is headquartered in 
natick and has more than 12000 employees worldwide 
mai basic said thursday that 293 million shares have been 
tendered so far added to the 19 million shares that mai and its 
affiliate brooke partners already hold that represents 648 
percent of primes outstanding common stock 
prime officials were quick to point out however that 
convertible debentures interestbearing bonds that the owner can 
convert to common stock could create several million more shares 
if that happens mai basic would have less than 50 percent of 
primes stock 
the tender offer is conditioned on mai basics obtaining at least 
67 percent of the stock prime stock closed at 1912 a share 
friday in new york stock exchange composite trading 
mai basic also faces two major obstacles a stockholder rights 
plan or poison pill that is the subject of a delaware court 
battle and a temporary injunction imposed by a massachusetts judge 
the poison pill a defense against hostile takeovers would 
further increase the number of shares outstanding making a takeover 
prohibitively costly the injunction bars mai basic from pursuing 
its bid until it has made full disclosure of its financing 
arrangements with drexel burnham lambert 
despite the injunction stockholders can still tender their 
shares to a custodian but until judge a david mazzone rules that 
mai has made a full disclosure mai basic cannot actually take 
possession of the shares 
prime spokesman richard eckel said the combination of the poison 
pill and the temporary injunction mean that a takeover is far from 
a done deal 
jay stevens an analyst with dean witter reynolds said eckel was 
legally correct 
but he said a lot of us do feel its getting close

the government on sunday imposed a 
wageandprice freeze revamped the currency and laid off 60000 
public employees as part of a sweeping program to control soaring 
inflation and trim a huge budget deficit 
union leaders immediately threatened to call for a nationwide 
general strike to protest the measures which eliminated an 
automatic monthly indexing of wages to inflation 
inflation should fall drastically and abruptly finance 
minister mailson da nobrega said at a press conference sunday 
nobrega said the measures were the toughest a brazilian 
government has taken at any one time 
monday and tuesday were declared bank holidays to allow time for 
the financial system to adapt to the new measures which included a 
17 percent devaluation of the cruzado creation of the socalled 
new cruzado worth 1000 old ones 
it also scraps the automatic monthly indexing of contracts 
savings accounts and most financial tranactions to cost of living 
increases 
among the measures designed to slash the massive public spending 
deficit were the layoff of about 60000 civil servants jobs the 
elimination of five cabinet ministries and the closing of 42 state 
companies and organs 
the reform package put together by president jose sarney and his 
economic advisors also includes a 45day price freeze on about 200 
basic commodities 
union leaders criticized the elimination of the wage index that 
gives workers monthly wage increases union figures show that in the 
past two years workers purchasing power has dipped in real terms 
by about 40 percent because of losses to inflation 
under the new measures workers will receive a last monthly 
increase in january in february wages will be adjusted according 
to the average inflation over the past 12 months and then frozen for 
an indefinite period 
we werent consulted about the measures which will cut into 
workers salaries luiz mederos leader of the sao paulo metal 
workers union said i have no doubts furious workers will react 
negatively and they will have our support in organizing a nationwide 
strike 
the program is the fourth antiinflation plan since sarney 
brazils first civilian president after 21 years of military rule 
took office in 1985 
brazils inflation rate hit an alltimehigh annual rate of 933 
percent in 1988 substantially higher than 1987s 366 percent 
inflation in december rose to 288 percent well above the 
25percent limit set by business social and government leaders in a 
social pact announced in november 
brazils public sector deficit widely believed to fuel 
inflation is running at about 6 percent of the nations 300 
billion gross national product 
in addition the countrys economy is stagnating with the gross 
national product up just 004 percent in 1988 according to 
government figures 
brazil is the third worlds leading debtor nation owing 115 
billion or more than a third of its gnp according to government 
figures
