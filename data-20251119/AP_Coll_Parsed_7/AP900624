iranian authorities fear that the death toll in 
thursdays devastating earthquake may reach 50000 a senior un 
relief official said sunday 
previous figures on the number of deaths had varied but 
officials had said earlier an estimated 40000 were feared dead 
mhamed essaafi also said parts of the stricken area were still 
inaccessible because roads in the caspian sea region were blocked 
by landslides and rain 
essaafi spoke at a press briefing after meeting with the head of 
the iranian mission to the un office in geneva ambassador sirous 
nasseri he said nasseri again stressed that iran was more urgently 
in need of relief supplies than in rescue personnel 
he said the number of injured was still believed to be about 
100000 but there was no confirmed figure yet he said the 
homeless numbered about half a million 
about 6000 injured people are being treated in tehran 
hospitals according to the iranian authorities hospitals in the 
affected provinces are filled to capacity essaafi added quoting 
official iranian reports 
essaafi named by un secretary general javier perez de cuellar 
to oversee the international earthquake relief effort said he did 
not think there was any effort by the iranians to underreport the 
casualty figure 
an iranian resistance movement mujahedeen khalq had made such 
an accusation 
essaafi said that during the next two days at least 32 relief 
flights from nine countries were scheduled to land at tehran 
airport 
he said they included 11 planes from west germany carrying 145 
tons of supplies plus a field hospital with two medial teams and 
nine flights from turkey 
other flights announced to the office of the un disaster 
relief coordinator undro were to arrive from bangladesh japan 
canada cuba czechoslovakia pakistan switzerland and britain he 
said 
iran also asked for help from un experts in improving 
communications which continued to pose problems in the quake zone 
the international red cross said friday iran expressly stated it 
did not want satellite communications equipment to be included in 
the relief supplies 
the un official who will leave for tehran on monday said 
that the situation was being handed rather well by iran 
since the predawn quake on thursday more than 200 aftershocks 
have hit the region the biggest registering 42 on the richter 
scale and rocking the tarome olia region about 125 miles northwest 
of tehran the official islamic republic news agency said 
thursdays quake was at least 73 on the richter scale

the strongest aftershock in three days hit a 
quakedevastated northern province sunday and a moderate 
earthquake was reported in southern iran 
the stench of decomposing bodies hung over gilan and zanjan 
provinces the two hardest hit in thursdays earthquake as 
rescuers aided by police dogs pulled corpses from the rubble and 
quickly buried them in mass graves to stem the outbreak of disease 
a senior un relief official said sunday in geneva that 
authorities fear the death toll may reach 50000 some official 
iranian reports have set the toll at 40000 
tehran times the nations leading englishlanguage newspaper 
quoted an unnamed official as saying 50000 people died and 200000 
were injured in the quake he said even that was a conservative 
estimate because the figures are quoted taking account only of 
those who have been registered officially as dead or wounded 
there are areas where bodies were buried without counting 
them he was quoted as saying 
tehran universitys geophysics center reported 60 aftershocks in 
the northern provinces the strongest of which jolted rasht 
capital of gilan province at 116 pm 546 am edt sunday it 
measured 57 on the richter scale 
the aftershock was the worst since several thursday shortly 
following the quake irna said details of casualties or damage from 
the aftershock were not immediately available but the 
rashtrudbar road which had just been reopened was once again 
blocked by the latest tremor which caused a mountain slide 
rasht is 35 miles north of rudbar which is on the border 
between gilan and zanjan provinces 
the geophysics center also reported a moderate earthquake 
measuring 49 on the richter scale in southern iran at 839 am 
109 pm it caused no casualties or damage no further details 
were available 
the center in a statement carried by the official islamic 
republic news agency said 360 tremors have struck northern iran 
since the quake 
the aftershocks have caused massive landslides blocking many 
roads leading to demolished villages on the northern edge of gilan 
on the caspian sea 
irna monitored in cyprus said more than 72 hours after the 
horrifying earthquake many villages in the mountainous region 
which have been leveled remain inaccessible 
the agency quoted a survivor from abbor village in zanjan as 
saying so many bodies have perished under the rubble they have 
not been retrieved or buried 
the whole area is stinking because of the decaying corpses 
which make rescue operations even more difficult the survivor 
identified as ahmad ali was quoted as saying 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph

the economic merger of the germanys on july 1 
probably will be a doubleedged sword for the rest of europe 
experts feel it will spur general economic growth and speed the 
march toward a single european market but also may give west 
germany already the strongest economy by far even more influence 
over the continents economic affairs 
the germans believe they have a strategy that will merge the two 
economies with minimum shock to the rest of europe but there are 
unknowns 
if the union increases inflation german interest rates may rise 
and the other western european economies linked in an 
exchangerate system may have to follow 
the economic merger is the first major step toward reunification 
of east and west germany 
on july 1 the west german mark becomes the currency of east 
germany and the germanys will merge their economic machinery to 
create what their treaty calls identical social market systems 
that means east germanys communist economic regulations will be 
replaced by west germanys corporate union and welfare practices 
overall it should provide a bit of a spur of growth around 
europe over the longer term said stephen king international 
economist with the london investment firm james capel and co it 
should be good for the other european export sectors 
britains national institute of economic and social research 
said in a report the rest of europe is expected to benefit both 
from higher demand in germany and also marginally because of 
increased centrally planned economies imports 
neighboring holland which sells onefourth of its exports to 
germany expects to benefit even if unification proves bumpy 
in the long run it will be a boon for the dutch said chen 
ie lie an analyst for banque paribas amsterdam people cant do 
without things like cheese poultry and pork 
more truck drivers could be employed in hauling foreign goods 
from the dutch port of rotterdam europes busiest to germany 
there also are worries 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain said in midjune 
that a unified germany within a federal europe would be dominant 
both in numbers and political and economic power 
asked whether that worried her mrs thatcher said yes 
and i think many people in europe are a little bit apprehensive 
about a unified germany 
king said quite clearly the other europeans are worried 
about having such a large germany in the center of europe 
there is of course the fear that germanys economy makes it 
much more politically powerful as a whole and raises its prestige 
and raises its power in the european community 
a united germany will have a population of nearly 80 million 
west germanys gross national product last year was 12 trillion 
more than 25 percent greater than secondplace france 
the central bundesbank with its traditionally tight 
inflationfighting monetary policy already dominates european 
monetary affairs 
unification of germany within the context of western european 
integration greatly complicates the economic and political issues 
in 1992 the 12 european community nations are to scrap trade 
barriers and become a single market 
germany and france want a single european currency and a single 
central bank britain is opposed but the national institute report 
said monetary integration appeared to have gained support in recent 
months 
peter pietsch an economist with commerzbank in frankfurt said 
of course germany has a big economic importance and the 
importance will grow i dont see how this would be a bad 
influence 
we want to be a group of countries with the same target and 
the same goal of low inflation he said in an interview we are 
european we feel european i think that is much more important 
than the isolated importance of one country 
king said france and the netherlands hope an integrated europe 
will spread power more evenly but germany would like to impose 
more strongly a bundesbank on the whole of europe and essentially 
make a deutsche mark bloc hans jaeckel senior german economist 
for the private forecasting firm dri europe in frankfurt said 
european integration should be hastened to create a less 
germandominated europe 
john major britains chancellor of the exchequer takes the 
opposite view 
there are those who see in the hectic pace of change in the 
east a reason for urging similarly hectic change within the 
community he told the german chamber of industry and commerce in 
london speed is of no advantage if you go in the wrong 
direction better to build slowly and well

republicans cant wait to get their hands 
on an upcoming book by the exwife of democratic gov james 
blanchard nervous democrats wish they could put it on hold until 
after the november elections 
paula blanchard says both sides are overreacting her book 
covering the 1987 breakup of her 21year marriage to blanchard is 
due out in july 
blanchard who last year married janet fox his former 
secretary is favored for reelection this fall over likely gop 
opponent john engler the state senate majority leader 
paula blanchards book til politics do us part is a 
question mark in the campaign but michigans former first lady 
predicts it wont affect the election 
this book is not a kissandtell book she said this book 
is not an exercise in vengefulness or anything like that its the 
story of my life as a political spouse and the choices i made and 
why i made the choices 
paula blanchard supports her exhusbandss reelection bid and 
predicts he will win based on his solid record of performance 
engler offers a different assessment 
he describes michigan as overtaxed sputtering economically and 
in need of a new leader he contends blanchard masks an average 
record with a highpowered public relations machine 
just think what the right man could do is the theme of his 
campaign 
engler himself is divorced and his exwife colleen also has 
written a book that touches on the breakup of their marriage 
colleen engler a former state legislator and onetime 
gubernatorial candidate who works for the commerce department in 
washington said she doesnt have a publisher yet 
it hasnt even been edited yet an editor might say you 
dont want any of this stuff about john engler in there she 
said my book is about running for governor in 1986 and then 
running for lieutenant governor 
blanchards divorce made frontpage news as did his remarriage 
but there has been no backlash from voters in fact the newlyweds 
got a warm welcome earlier this month on a twoday tour to announce 
his bid for a third fouryear term 
paula blanchard said the governor and a number of his associates 
asked her to hold up her book until after the election 
the curious thing is none of them have read it she said 
they were asking me to hold it based on speculation and 
assumptions 
ive encouraged jim to read the book after he does that his 
concerns about it will be minimized he will be able to see its a 
book that puts a lot into perspective she said it goes 
directly from my heart to the page 
blanchard is unopposed in michigans aug 7 primary while 
engler is expected to easily defeat tax fighter john lauve a march 
poll found blanchard leading engler 51 percent to 31 percent but 
the lesserknown engler said that was to be expected early in the 
campaign 
engler launched his campaign in february and immediately began 
airing television ads aimed at boosting his name identification 
democrats say englers leadership is untested and focus on 
blanchards record in erasing a 17 billion debt his efforts to 
diversify the states economy improve education and fight crime 
while keeping the state budget balanced 
the governors first tv ad unveiled last month touted 
blanchard as tough on crime and set out his campaign theme 
tough tested trusted 
the ad closed with a white guard yelling at a black inmate at 
michigans boot camp prison for nonviolent young offenders who 
volunteer for its militarystyle discipline 
the ad was aired everywhere in the state except detroit which 
is twothirds black englers campaign director dan pero 
denounced it as racist and some black leaders and lawmakers agreed 
the ad later aired in detroit blanchard defended it as showing 
a real answer to a tough problem and dismissed the whole 
controversy as being manufactured by republicans 
the flap ended quickly and michigan democratic party chairman 
tom lewand said it was well behind us and not something to be 
concerned about 
but engler sees cracks in blanchards public image and cites 
the boot camp ad tight budgets ahead and 78yearold lt gov 
martha griffiths decision not to retire which came as a surprise 
to the governor 
the carefully constructed facade is in tatters engler said 
this is a very isolated administration that isnt as finely tuned 
and welloiled as people would believe

an antiamerican newspaper in iran said 
sunday the united states is partly to blame for the death of tens 
of thousands of people in last weeks earthquake 
the criminal role of america in irans past became evident 
once again in the recent earthquake the jomhuri islami said in 
an editorial reported by the official islamic republic news agency 
our people even under the rubble chant death to america 
and pray to god to cut off the hands of the united states even 
those hands stretched out to help it said 
it argued that by plundering irans oil and other resources 
for 25 years the united states had prevented the use of even a 
small part of the national wealth for urban development projects 
and advanced antiseismic building construction systems 
even after its expulsion from iran the us government by 
imposing economic sanctions and launching several other plots 
halted the renovation of the country the editorial added 
the newspaper was implying that with these actions the united 
states had blocked the diversion of funds to earthquake safety 
measures 
if the united states has real humanitarian objectives and 
intended to help the iranian nation it should do only one thing 
stop hatching plots the newspaper said 
it called on iranians to reject relief offers by the united 
states and other governments whose hands are stained with the 
blood of the iranian people 
iran at odds with the united states since the 1979 seizure of 
hostages at the us embassy in tehran has said it would welcome 
relief from the american red cross and other us humanitarian 
groups the two nations have no diplomatic ties

public housing tenants known to deal drugs 
will be kicked out of their apartments during nationwide raids set 
to begin this week even if they havent been convicted of a crime 
officials say 
federal marshals are scheduled monday to begin raiding 
apartments in housing projects located in as many as 22 cities 
where the holder of the lease is a known drug dealer and could be 
prosecuted for two felonies officials said 
the tenant and his or her family may be kicked out of the 
apartment even if the person has not yet been convicted of a drug 
crime under the program first announced last month by housing 
secretary jack kemp officials said 
the government calls the actions leasehold forfeitures not 
evictions the plan already has stirred up a legal challenge in one 
city 
the forfeiture of publichousing leases by known drug dealers is 
specifically authorized by assetforfeiture provisions of the 1988 
antidrug abuse act government officials say the same provisions 
enable federal prosecutors to seize boats cars and cash of drug 
dealers awaiting trial 
in this case the lease is the asset to be seized 
the raids are scheduled to be conducted in cities where 
authorities have identified drug dealing in housing projects as a 
significant problem 
the targeted housing projects are in some of the nations 
largest cities new york los angeles chicago as well as 
smaller municipalities such as chandler ariz tacoma wash and 
frederick md according to a list obtained by the associated 
press 
bob nipp a spokesman for the department of housing and urban 
development declined to comment on the planned raids when kemp 
first announced the plan he declined to identify the cities where 
housing projects would be raided 
civil libertarians have criticized the planned raids saying 
they will violate the principle that a person is innocent of 
criminal wrongdoing until proven guilty 
legal aid lawyers in richmond va one of the targeted cities 
last week obtained a temporary restraining order from a federal 
judge barring the government from removing tenants without giving 
them advance notice and an opportunity to be heard 
the order by us district judge richard l williams in effect 
affords tenants some of the due process of eviction proceedings it 
only applies to the richmond area but legal aid lawyers are 
expected to seek similar court rulings in other cities 
under guidelines adopted by the department of housing and urban 
development and the justice department only apartments that are 
notorious and open sites of drug distribution and leased by known 
drug dealers will be raided officials said 
the guidelines also state that authorities should have proof 
beyond a reasonable doubt that the leaseholder committed at least 
two felony drug crimes and will face prosecution said the 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
it was not known if authorities also planned to serve search 
warrants to seek possible evidence of drug activity 
the plan calls for using local social service agencies to 
relocate children and elderly people who will be displaced from 
their homes by the raids officials said 
public housing projects in the following cities also have been 
targeted washington atlanta dallas baltimore hartford conn 
newark nj indianapolis flint mich charleston sc macon 
ga el paso texas kansas city omaha portland ore and st

when last seen the sr71 blackbird spy plane 
was slicing through a dreary march sky for a recordsetting final 
coasttocoast flight that touched off regrets and doubts over its 
retirement 
the air force and congress had decided several months earlier 
that the reconnaissance aircraft which provided unsurpassed 
snooping during the cold war had become too costly and that 
satellites could do the job easily 
shortly after its 68minute 17second trip from los angeles to 
washington blackbird no 17972 was shipped off to the smithsonian 
institution 
but the blackbird wasnt quite dead yet 
tucked away in the report accompanying a 4 billion spending 
bill that president bush signed last month was a provision telling 
the pentagon to maintain at least six of the spy planes for use in 
the event of a national crisis 
the above outlined program should not be considered a charter 
for reestablishment of sr71 flight operations which were 
terminated as a part of the fiscal 1990 budget deliberations the 
report said 
rather the intent of the lawmakers action was to ensure that 
the national aeronautics and space administration which will 
receive three of the planes has enough funds to conduct 
aeronautics research and that the air force could begin flight 
operations within 90 days of an emergency 
the report even designated the aircraft by tail numbers for the 
contingency program 
although the report provision is nonbinding pentagon refusal 
to adhere to the language would be too costly in the tenuous 
relationship between congress and the bush administration 
thus behindthescenes negotiations have been going on between 
the air force and several congressional committees over the report 
language and the cost to maintain the black daggershaped planes 
is a major issue 
lawmakers and congressional sources who requested anonymity 
said air force gen michael j dugan told members of congress that 
the cost of maintenance would total 30 million 
dugan is commander of the air force in europe and president 
bushs nominee for chief of staff a selection the senate armed 
services committee approved last week 
the report said the air force should use 6 million of money it 
already has for upkeep of the aircraft 
shortly before pentagon and congressional negotiators sought a 
common ground on the issue defense secretary dick cheney staked 
out his position in testimony before the senate appropriations 
defense subcommittee 
we can park them cheney told the panel earlier this month 
we cant bring them back within 90 days without going back and 
spending a lot of money to reconstitute at least a portion of 
manpower and maintenance and so forth and recertify pilots 
dugan in his senate confirmation hearing complained of the 
conflicting guidance from the congress on the issue 
the resources to get the five or six airplanes operational 
within a 90day period those resources are considerably more than 
made available dugan told the armed services panel 
rep joseph mcdade of pennsylvania ranking republican on the 
house appropriations subcommittee on defense said lawmakers did 
not believe the report provision was an unreasonable 
disposition for the spy plane 
the blackbird regularly flew missions over heavily defended 
north vietnam and provided intelligence in many other regions 
including the middle east china and the persian gulf 
the plane can outrun the fastest fighters and has never been 
shot down built to withstand temperatures of more than 800 degrees 
fahrenheit its skin is a titanium alloy instead of the aluminum 
used on most airplanes it can sustain a speed of mach 3 or three 
times the speed of sound but its maximum speed is classified 
mcdade noted that cheney during his tenure as a wyoming 
congressman on the house intelligence committee had opposed the 
blackbird 
cheney always felt the system was not a costeffective system 
he didnt think it justified the expenditures mcdade said in an 
interview last week 
congressional sources said the provision in the spending bill 
report was perceived by the armed services intelligence and 
appropriations committees as the best opportunity to resolve the 
issue and negotiations were going well 
if they fail however the question of the highflying blackbird 
is certain to surface in next years defense bills which congress 
will begin crafting later this summer 
theyre not going to recreate the sr71 but its not going 
away lock stock and barrel one congressional source said

two extreme rightwing groups 
signed a cooperation agreement sunday in the latest effort by 
proapartheid whites to build opposition to reforms instituted by 
president fw de klerk 
the groups also pledged support for a white fugitive who has 
declared war on the government 
both de klerk and african national congress leader nelson 
mandela have warned that heavily armed rightwing extremists could 
undermine efforts to launch blackwhite negotiations on a new 
constitution and ending apartheid 
the boer resistance movement and the boer state party announced 
sunday they would work together to establish a homeland for the 
boers or afrikaners the countrys dutchdescended settlers who 
account for 3 million of the 5 million whites 
the two groups which are believed to have several thousand 
followers among them are among several rightwing organizations 
that favor strict segregation and oppose all concessions to south 
africas 28 million blacks 
the organizations consider the anc the countrys largest black 
opposition group a communistled terrorist movement 
the rightwing groups promised all possible legal support 
for piet rudolph a member of the boer state party who declared war 
on de klerks government last week 
rudolph has been in hiding since he allegedly stole arms and 
ammunition from an air force base in april he made his declaration 
of war in a videotape sent to a newspaper the government has 
offered a 19000 reward for information leading to rudolphs 
arrest 
the two afrikaner groups said they had established a fund to 
help all the other unknown piet rudolphs who have to flee 
from the de klerkmandela communists 
rightwingers have been threatening the government for months 
events of the past week provided the strongest indications yet that 
such groups are ready to act 
among them 
two offices belonging to de klerks national party were bombed 
friday night causing extensive damage but no injuries no one has 
claimed responsibility but government officials say rightwing 
whites are the most likely suspects 
an afrikaanslanguage newspaper reported friday that white 
extremists were planning to assassinate mandela and de klerk and 
poison drinking water in soweto the huge black township outside 
johannesburg police arrested 11 whites for questioning but all 
were released friday and no charges have been filed 
most political analysts believe that an increasing number of 
whites are joining rightwing groups in response to de klerks 
reforms the proapartheid conservative party captured 31 percent 
of the vote in white elections last september and would probably 
improve on that figure if polls were held at present analysts say 
de klerk says he wants to end racial discrimination in south 
africa and negotiate a constitution that allows blacks and whites 
to share power under the current apartheid system whites control 
the government and the economy

government troops hunting for tamil 
rebels crept forward sunday from two sides towards warravaged 
batticaloa and residents said the city was waiting to die 
a defense ministry statement said 16 soldiers and 11 separatists 
were killed in fighting that has already left more than 1400 
combatants and an unknown number of civilians dead 
residents of batticaloa on the eastern coast said they feared 
reprisals by government troops who are mostly sinhalese because 
the rebels burned police stations and sinhalese shops before 
fleeing into the jungles 
we are like a drum beaten on both sides first the tigers 
threatened and killed many of us and now government soldiers are 
coming we can only pray said a hotel owner on condition of 
anonymity 
the city has been without electricity and transport since the 
fighting began 
military officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
troops were approaching batticaloa from chenkaladi in the north and 
kalmunai in the south and were expected to reach the town early 
monday 
the troops are mainly sinhalese who make up about 75 percent of 
sri lankas 16 million people tamil rebels say the sinhalese 
discriminate in hiring and education against mainly hindu tamils 
who make up 18 percent of the population 
batticaloa 135 miles northeast of colombo was the first 
flashpoint of the fighting that erupted two weeks ago ending a 
13month ceasefire between the government and the militants of the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
according to the defense ministry statement nine soldiers died 
saturday when tamil rebels blew up a motorized military patrol near 
weli oya village in the north another seven soldiers and 11 rebels 
died when government troops attempted but failed to reach the 
besieged kankesanthurai naval base on jaffna peninsula 
on saturday troops destroyed five rebel bunkers and cleared 
land mines as they moved towards batticaloa the military officials 
said 
a tamil reporter in the city described batticaloas 200000 
people 85 percent tamil and the rest moslem as populating a 
city waiting to die 
batticaloa has a whole lot of scars a burnt buddhist temple 
and a police station and the gutted remains of eight sinhalese 
shops the sinhalese soldiers are going to be pretty mad when they 
get here said the reporter speaking on the condition he was not 
identified further 
on saturday president ranasinghe premadasa the architect of 
the ceasefire forged in may 1989 with the rebels said he still 
hoped for a negotiated settlement 
several tamil militant groups had been fighting for a separate 
homeland in the northeast since 1983 but most gave up their 
weapons after a 1987 peace accord the tamil tigers after a brief 
acceptance reneged on the pact and began attacking indian soldiers 
more than 11000 people have been killed in the sevenyear 
revolt

they came from the across the 
tracks and the more they were snubbed the closer they became the 
immigrant kids are retired now but they still celebrate their 
exploits as members of the deadline gang 
the youthful alliances forged during the 1920s and 1930s will be 
renewed this saturday when the gang children of immigrants who 
moved to western massachusetts in the 1900s gets together for a 
sixth time 
the memories come tumbling out when members of the deadline 
gang recall growing up in a gritty railroad town when the 
century was young 
for lester lamothe it was picking nuggets of reusable coal from 
the piles dumped at the railroad yards for cy conner it was 
playing the whip hanging on to the back of a model t spinning 
across a frozen river for john dechaine it was swiping ears of 
corn to roast on summer bonfires 
thats all we had we didnt have anything big but this was 
ours said sam pompei balding 72 years old but with the 
mischief of youth glinting behind his thick glasses this goes 
back to the 1920s and the same feeling toward each other has 
existed ever since 
lets be honest everyone looks at everyone else and sees how 
old they are lamothe said of course i dont get old 
just how the gang got started is hard to determine members say 
they never had a meeting a formal meeting it just sort of 
grew out of nothing pompei recalled when you came through 
this area we never bothered anybody but we said dont bother 
our property just behave yourselves 
deadline territory was just a few blocks bounded by a 
river railroad tracks industrial yards and a street 
this was our back yard this is where we played and this is 
where we fought weve always stuck together said lamothe the 
68yearold chairman of the gangs reunions held sporadically at 
first but biennial since 1986 
everyone looked at us as you come from across the tracks 
he said the more they looked down on us the more we stayed 
together 
nowadays shopping strips and fastfood joints have swallowed up 
the fields where the children used to play and somehow world war 
ii was the time the last of the deadliners grew up 
but even as adults living in a world that no longer revolved 
around the railroad and the local ice rink the group held onto its 
past 
now that retirement has freed their afternoons deadliners still 
living in their hometown can often be found at the dante club a 
social club housed in what used to be the neighborhood elementary 
school 
out come the scrapbooks and the faded blackandwhite 
photographs as new life is breathed into the decadesold memories 
that ones me a whitehaired flora senk says pointing to a 
1927 picture of children lined up against the wall shirts stiff 
with starch 
look at those long stockings she says with a laugh 
pointing to the clothswathed legs of the darkeyed girl she once 
was 
other photographs celebrate the exploits of the grownup gang 
pete bessone played hockey with the detroit red wings the 
zucchini brothers mario and babe played for the preworld war ii 
italian olympic ice hockey team and there is 1943 heisman trophy 
winner angelo bertelli who now lives in clifton nj but plans 
to be on hand for the reunion 
there was a closeness bertelli recalled we were all 
firstgeneration italians or most of us our parents not too many 
of them spoke good english but it was a beautiful existence 
none of us was hungry 
the reunions started in 1939 when gang members decided to get 
together one last time as war threatened that session and two more 
reunions didnt include women but in 1986 the women insisted on 
inclusion two years ago about 500 people showed up and this year 
the rules have been amended to allow the children of members to 
attend 
bertelli said he wouldnt miss the chance to see his old 
friends for the heisman trophy winner the deadline gang comes 
down to one thing 
i think of my youth he said

rampant unemployment racial division 
poverty nelson mandela neednt look far in washington to find some 
of the same troubles that afflict his homeland 
tourists stroll the manicured mall and the pristine capitol 
grounds but just a stones throw away the citys black community 
struggles 
many of washingtons problems can be laid at the altar of a 
flourishing drug trade 
a nelson mandela a jesse jackson or any other leader is not 
going to change it says gary burke a street vendor in the 
predominantly black southeast section of the city talk alone is 
not going to do it its around me every day and it affects us 
deeply 
more than 400 people were murdered in the nations capital in 
1989 and another 200 were slain in the first half of 1990 more 
than half of the deaths blamed on drugs 
during mandelas visit mayor marion barry will be spending his 
days in court standing trial on drug and perjury charges 
the citys infant mortality rate rose to an alarming 232 deaths 
per 1000 live births in 1988 more than double the national 
average 
weve been hit by a hurricane that government cant control 
patricia tompkins chief of the office of maternal and child 
health said theres a tremendous amount of drug abuse among 
women of childbearing age 
many of those babies were born to teenagers of the 10514 
births recorded in 1988 1765 were born to girls ages 1519 
local youth employment programs have helped slash the teen 
jobless rate by half in recent years but it still stood at 20 
percent in 1988 
mandela is not scheduled to see washingtons disadvantaged side 
during his threeday visit nonetheless many washington blacks 
share the excitement mandela has generated since his release from 
27 years in south african prisons 
i think its wonderful said von mcmeekin a graphics 
worker i think hes going to bring more of an understanding of 
black people toward each other 
nelson mandela is a symbol to black americans of great 
courage principle integrity and sacrifice said randall 
robinson executive director of the antiapartheid lobby 
transafrica this is the most soughtafter person of our time 
robinson and others said mandela is an inspiration to washington 
blacks who outnumber whites by more than 2to1 but share little 
in the citys overall affluence

leaders of the european community begin a 
summit meeting monday divided over soviet aid and south african 
sanctions but set to press ahead with plans to achieve political 
and monetary union by 1993 
the whole trend is toward unity and coherence and integration 
and not the other way about irish prime minister charles haughey 
said he spoke in a radio interview on the eve of the twoday 
summit in the medieval dublin castle 
for the first time an east bloc leader east german prime 
minister lothar de maziere will join the summit as a guest east 
germany is due to become part of the 12nation trade bloc after 
german unificiation expected by the end of the year 
despite reservations by britains margaret thatcher the summit 
appeared certain to agree to begin a conference on political union 
in december it would run alongside one on economic and monetary 
union with a december 1992 deadline for final conclusions 
mrs thatcher is confident that political union will amount to 
what she terms much closer cooperation among the 12 nations 
rather than grandiose plans for some kind of federal europe 
at an emergency summit in april the community leaders agreed to 
strive toward an undefined form of political union spurred by what 
they see as the need for stability in the rapidly changing 
continent 
britain threatened with being sidelined while the other 11 
nations move toward economic union last week suggested that the 
community create a new currency primarily for tourists and 
businessmen the banknotes of the european currency unit would 
circulate with the 12 exisiting currencies 
the plan is expected to be discussed in dublin but it has 
received a lukewarm response and been dismissed by critics as the 
creation of a glorified travelers check 
the issue of aid to the soviet union was a lastminute addition 
to the loose agenda after west germany and france last week called 
for the swift organization of a major western aid program to help 
president mikhail s gorbachevs crumbling economy 
west german and french officials will also seek to get the 
united states and japan to agree to an aid package at a meeting 
next month in houston of the worlds leading industrialized nations 
community officials said there was little prospect of any 
agreement on soviet aid being reached at the dublin meeting 
britain in particular endorses the us view that the right 
course is to give technical and other assistance rather than 
pouring in money to an economy that is potentially rich but grossly 
mismanaged 
on south african sanctions the summit appeared likely also to 
refuse to lift measures and agree only on a general experession of 
support for president fw de klerks reform measures 
britain has already lifted socalled voluntary measures 
such as discouraging academic contact and trade missions to south 
africa but the community approval is required to end a ban on 
imports of south african iron steel and gold coins and new 
investment agreed in 1986 
after the summit the communitys sixmonth rotating presidency 
will pass to italy the other members of the bloc are west germany 
britain france denmark the netherlands spain portugal greece 
belgium and luxembourg

if alderman jack korshak has his way 
students at northwestern university will be first in the nation to 
pay a tax on tuition 
administrators at northwestern and other schools nationwide 
students and the american council on education say such a tax would 
hurt students and take a swipe at the value of education 
the city council in this chicago suburb of 75000 residents has 
tried before and failed to implement such a tax korshak a 12year 
member of the council and a northwestern graduate says the move to 
tax is back because in his view his alma mater wants something for 
nothing 
the stated public attitude of northwestern is we dont give 
you a dime said korshak if you treat people in a rotten way 
sooner or later people are going to react 
the reaction came in the form of a proposed 05 percent tax on 
tuition levied against students at northwestern and three smaller 
colleges in evanston including two seminaries 
most of northwesterns nearly 10500 students are undergraduates 
who would pay about 68 a year based on next years annual tuition 
of 13725 the tax would raise more than 700000 a year said 
alderman marjorie collens head of the city councils budget policy 
committee 
the committee passed the tax proposal may 31 collens who 
opposes the plan said it likely will be introduced to the full 
council monday and could be decided on july 9 
no other city in the united states has such a tax according to 
sheldon e steinbach vice president and general counsel of the 
washington dcbased american council on education the council 
represents 1500 colleges and universities nationwide 
a tuition tax would be very poor public policy he said 
tuition already is high and to impose an additional burden on 
parents is somewhat unconscionable 
some other large universities make donations to their host 
cities but usually because city property they have had to buy 
said michael weston vice president and general counsel at 
northwestern 
cornell university pays its host city of ithaca ny more than 
2 million in contributions user fees and property taxes on 
universityowned land not used for educational purposes said david 
i stewart cornells director of community relations yale and 
harvard also make lumpsum payments to their host cities 
some university of california campuses reimburse their host 
cities for services like fire protection and city planning said 
ron kolb spokesman for the uc system 
but its always been our position that students shouldnt have 
to shoulder that burden kolb said 
we have always felt its important to keep fees as low as 
possible and i think the university would resist a taxation 
structure he said 
korshak says northwestern consistently has avoided paying for 
police and fire protection but weston says the university is a 
good neighbor bringing an estimated half million visitors a year 
to the city adding millions of dollars to the evanston economy 
and providing cultural advantages often used by city residents 
the university also has its own police force handling most 
campus calls he said 
what this tells the nation and the world about evanston is 
really unhealthy the notion that education should somehow be 
subject to tax like liquor or cigarettes weston said 
education may be addictive but its clearly a beneficial 
addiction 
lee ellis another northwestern vice president testified at the 
committees hearing that the school pays nearly 1 million a year 
in utility taxes permit costs and fees while students spend 10 
million a year and the university spends 7 million a year in the 
city 
but korshak calls the campus a money machine because he says its 
annual budget dwarfs the city budget of 776 million 
northwesterns operating budget this year is 610 million said 
ken wildes director of university relations 
theres no question that northwestern is a bigger operation 
than the city of evanston wildes said it doesnt mean were 
flush with funds as he implies 
some students also object 
i really think its absurd that theyre trying to tax the 
students said paul murphy 20 a junior from syosset ny 
dave hursey 23 manager of a chessking mens clothing store 
near campus said the campus contributes enough 
if it wasnt for the college i dont know if evanston would 
have much to put it on the map he said

the government has begun to 
routinely issue permits to nonwhites applying to live in 
whitesonly neighborhoods a leading newspaper reported sunday 
president fw de klerk has said that in 1991 the government 
will amend the law segregating residential areas by race but a 
growing number of blacks indians and people of mixedrace are 
seeking and receiving official permission to move to white 
neighborhoods even before parliament changes the law the sunday 
star of johannesburg said 
the newspaper said that when the government received an 
individual request by a nonwhite to live in white area approval 
often was sent in less than 24 hours 
as yet i have not had a permit refused one unidentified 
real estate agent told the sunday star 
the report gave no indication of how many applications have been 
approved in recent weeks or months government offices were closed 
sunday and officials could not be reached for comment 
the group areas act passed in 1950 segregates south african 
residential areas by race and is considered one of the pillars of 
apartheid 
however tens of thousands of blacks in recent years have moved 
illegally into innercity neighborhoods officially reserved for 
whites a far smaller number has applied for and received 
permission 
the government has largely stopped prosecuting alleged 
violations of the group areas act although dozens of bureaucrats 
are assigned to enforce the measure last week prosecutors dropped 
11 cases against 30 people 
the government also has opened four small neighborhoods to all 
races 
de klerk wants to amend the group areas act but has said he 
opposes its repeal he has not spelled out a new plan but has said 
the new law must be supported by a majority of south africans 
there is a surplus of housing for the 5 million whites in south 
africa but blacks face a critical shortage several million of the 
countrys 28 million blacks live in squatter shacks

bats dehydration and hallucinations during the wait for rescuers 
that began soon after their lamps went out while they explored a 
side trail lutes said 
if it had gone on another day it wouldve been a different 
outcome lutes said in a telephone interview with the associated 
press from his hospital bed 
for the first few days i thought we would be rescued he 
said after the fifth day i was really beginning to wonder 
lutes a member of the national speleological society said it 
was the first time he had gotten lost in 20 years of cave 
adventuring 
he and his sons were exploring new trout cave in pendleton 
county in eastern west virginia about 200 miles west of 
washington dc 
the trouble began when lutes put down his pack to squeeze 
through a small opening intending to retrieve the pack on his way 
out when their lamps later went out he and his sons couldnt find 
the opening or the pack which held food water and extra 
flashlights 
when the light started going out i knew there was a serious 
problem the boys got upset because they saw the look in my face 
but it was basically calm from then on lutes said 
i knew if there was panic or terror wed be nowhere we 
wouldnt have made it unless we were sitting and being calm he 
said 
they took turns keeping watch they recited psalms and prayed 
they would be rescued lutes said 
the search began after relatives in powhatan va contacted 
police when the luteses missed a meeting police said about 25 
experienced cave rescuers from virginia west virginia and maryland 
helped police search 
using lutes parked car as a starting point they began combing 
three sets of caves friday morning 
they found the pack shortly after 1230 am saturday and 
reached the luteses about 90 minutes later about a halfmile into 
a cave said state trooper rd gillespie in franklin 
the three were caked in dirt and parched but otherwise were in 
remarkably good condition he said 
they were thirsty and just jubilant to see the light of day 
even though it was night gillespie said 
barry chute a national speleological society member from 
burtonsville md who led the rescue effort said the luteses 
behaved smartly 
if you get lost and lose your light sources you cant go 
anywhere in a cave he said you cant grope your way out 
youd just go in circles 
lutes who with his sons was being treated for dehydration and 
exhaustion said he plans to give up caves 
when i was down in there it sure made things seem 
insignificant things i thought were important before i thought to 
myself if i ever get out of this what do those things mean job 
pressure whether i get the lawn mowed things like that 
i prayed so hard id be given a second chance and it came 
through

police found no explosives or arms aboard the airliner said erkki 
lepola head of air traffic controllers at helsinki airport 
it was the second hijacking of a soviet aircraft to finland in 
less than a week and the third to scandinavia in two weeks

in the united states 
a soviet civil aviation official in moscow identified the 
hijacker as m varfolomeyev finnish authorities refused to confirm 
his identity because of his asylum request soviet authorities have 
asked for his extradition 
witnesses said varfolomeyev took control of the plane five 
minutes after takeoff from tallinn and demanded that the crew 
divert the flight to stockholm sweden 
about five minutes after takeoff he went to the toilet with 
his briefcase then to an air hostess so i thought he was sick 
said vladimir vager a passenger who sat next to the hijacker 
when he came back to his seat he said to us all of you 
remain seated and obey me and he said he had a bomb in his 
briefcase vager told the associated press he said everyone on 
the plane remained calm

the democrats campaign to unseat 
republican gov kay orr has taken a detour by way of the 
courtroom to decide a primary election cliffhanger 
unofficial tallies from a recount in may 15s closestever 
democratic primary election showed ben nelson with a 32vote lead 
over bill hoppner but the state board of canvassers has not 
certified the results 
last week the board ordered 23 of the states 93 counties to 
count by hand some ballots that machines had read as having no vote 
in the race the additional counting was expected to begin this 
week 
but nelson an omaha lawyer has asked the nebraska supreme 
court to order the board to certify the results and declare him the 
primary winner hoppner a former aide to sen bob kerrey dneb 
faced a monday deadline for filing a challenge to the election 
the situation has left mrs orr who has received high 
disapproval ratings in recent polls wondering against whom she 
should campaign 
research is difficult acknowledged scott matter mrs orrs 
campaign manager what do you do spend your mornings on hoppner 
and afternoons on nelson 
recent floods and tornadoes have given mrs orr a chance to be 
visible in an official capacity statewide 
during a flight to view floodravaged northeastern nebraska 
mrs orr said thursday that she was anxiously awaiting the 
selection of a challenger but her campaign goes on with or 
without a known opponent 
mrs orrs unpopularity is based largely on the perception that 
she raised taxes the governor said that taxes were raised 
inadvertently when nebraskas income tax structure was adjusted to 
match federal guidelines 
she admitted the mistake nearly a year after it was made and 
attempted to soothe ruffled property owners by returning 118 
million to them through legislation last year 
shes clearly in a nasty situation said larry grisolano 
hoppner campaign manager with her negative approval numbers 
shes got to be anxious to go on the attack the time lag is to her 
detriment he said 
the situation has put mrs orr in a difficult position in other 
ways to avoid a potential conflict of interest she excused 
herself from wednesdays meeting of the fivemember canvass board 
which she normally chairs 
but it has also posed problems for the democrats 
state democratic party chairman mike dugan said it has slowed 
fundraising but the money hasnt gone anyplace else its still 
there a gold mine just waiting to be tapped 
grisolano said the eventual democratic nominee will have to 
play a quick catchup in fundraising but a lot of people are 
ready to give to the candidate 
nelson said he hasnt changed his campaign strategy but im 
eager to get it rolling 
democrats have viewed 1990 as an opportunity to recapture the 
governorship 
a midapril poll of 900 nebraskans by the omaha worldherald 
showed mrs orrs approval rating was 39 percent while her 
disapproval rating was 51 percent 
and in the gop primary omaha businessman mort sullivan who did 
little campaigning received 30 percent of the vote matter said 
sullivans showing was a concern 
but look at hoppner and nelson each of them only got 27 
percent of the vote in the sevenman democratic primary matter 
said 
dugan said that low percentage is not a concern 
i am very confident that either one of these candidates have 
the ability to beat kay orr he said 
dugan said the primary has drawn a lot of attention to the 
party but it hasnt harmed us any it has the governor concerned 
and the republicans dont really know which set of advertisements 
to use 
the republicans can draw on the party for campaign support 
president bush has been in nebraska twice in four months vice 
president quayle visited once and the past few weeks brought senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan and bushs chief of staff john 
sununu to orr fundraisers

neither rain nor sleet nor snow nor dark of 
night nor michael jackson shall keep the us postal service from 
its appointed rounds 
thats what lawyer thomas wampold reasoned after trying to serve 
a summons and other court papers to jackson 
wampold filed a classaction suit that alleges jackson was not 
sick as he said he was when he canceled three concerts in tacoma 
and that he therefore committed a breach of contract with 72000 
fans 
a telephone call seeking comment from jacksons publicist lee 
solters in los angeles on sunday was not immediately returned 
the suit also names ticketmaster corp which withheld service 
fees from refunds on tickets sold to the canceled october and 
november 1988 concerts 
wampold had no luck trying to reach jacksons attorney in los 
angeles by telephone so he decided to have a process server go to 
jacksons residence 
but process server mark hamilton was turned away repeatedly by 
guards at jacksons encino and malibu homes at encino hamilton 
was first told jackson didnt live there and then was told he was 
out of town and wouldnt be back for several weeks 
wampold finally asked king county judge marsha pechman for an 
order allowing him to give jackson legal notice of the case by 
firstclass and certified mail the judge granted the request 
wampold figures guards may turn away process servers but 
nothing stops the us postal service

thousands of relics left by a lost indian 
tribe in the ruins of their famed cliff houses were methodically 
looted before the turn of the century now a band of reverse 
archaeologists wants to bring them home 
before congress outlawed the practice in 1905 collecting 
baskets pots tools and other everyday household items from 
anasazi indian ruins was a thrilling romp through history for 
explorers hired by east coast collectors 
like the swashbuckling treasure hunter in the indiana jones 
movies they took the ancient ruins of a culture that vanished 
before europeans reached the new world 
most of the loot eventually found its way into museum display 
cases large collections are housed at the american museum of 
natural history in new york and the museum of the american indian 
in new york among others 
but a group of volunteer researchers is eager to bring them home 
to the four corners area of the southwest where the anasazi 
pioneered farming and built dense communities hundreds of feet high 
in scenic cliffsides 
julia johnson the director of the volunteer wetherillgrand 
gulch researchers decried the looting at a recent symposium on the 
early anasazis known as the basketmakers in blanding utah 
the group wants to reverse the actions of 1890s explorers and 
return the artifacts to museums as close to the ruins from which 
they were taken as possible 
to help achieve that and to help scientists study the anasazi 
5000 pages of documents and 500 photographs have been compiled on 
the museum artifacts to trace their origins 
since many of the earlyday explorers kept meticulous diaries 
its possible in some cases to identify exactly which hole 
something came out of said fred blackburn a biologist who 
joined the reverse archaeologists 
blackburn 40 and his colleagues crawl through grand gulch in 
utah about 100 miles west of cortez searching for signatures the 
explorers carved into cliff walls 
by matching the individual artifacts on display in eastern 
museums with the diaries blackburns group can supply a research 
base for scientists studying the basketmaker era of the anasazi he 
said 
the ruins were virtually cleared out and their treasures carted 
off by the time congress forbade the practice in 1905 blackburn 
said 
and the expeditions werent real researchers said 
blackburn whose wife victoria atkins is an archaeologist 
theres so much we dont know about the basketmakers 
the basketmaker anasazis lived in the area from about the time 
of christ until the year 700 blackburn said 
they are believed to be the farming pioneers of the tribe that 
built a thriving civiliation in the famous cliff houses of mesa 
verde national park their pueblo anasazi descendants disappeared 
from the area apparently driven by a long drought in about 1300 
were putting this together so researchers can go back and 
find out what the origins of these people were their customs 
where they came from and where they went blackburn said 
he started with the diary of charles cary graham who with 
charles mcloyd began excavating grand gulch in 1890 the pair met 
richard wetherill and charlie mason just as the latter two were 
riding out after discovering the landmark balcony house at mesa 
verde 
wetherill a nearby rancher and amateur archaeologist hired 
graham and mcloyd to bring artifacts from grand gulch to the local 
historical society the collection later ended up at the field 
museum in chicago 
as news of the rich ruins spread other expeditions followed 
explorers erasing clues to the mysterious anasazis past in their 
diligence to gather prized artifacts 
one likely site for any relics returned to the region would be 
the anasazi heritage center in dolores a town north of cortez 
initial efforts will try to arrange artifact loans with the 
eventual goal of establishing permanent exhibits volunteers said 
fundraising is under way to pay for lobbying visits to museums 
that house large anasazi collections 
blackburn who specializes in studies of bighorn sheep says his 
strong ties to the four corners area prompted his reverse 
archaeology work hes especially fascinated with evidence of the 
anasazis ability to coexist with the sheep that used to roam the 
area in large numbers 
the fledgling reverse archaeolgist movement looking for 
artifacts in museums to bring them back to historic sites rather 
than the other way around could provide clues to true 
archaeologists enabling them to unravel the mystery surrounding the 
demise of the anasazi he said 
archaeology is really pretty new here in southwest colorado 
he said and there hasnt been much done on the basketmakers 
there are a lot of parallels between the anasazi and what we 
have today overpopulation and drought were a major problem for 
them and many archaeologists think thats what drove them out of 
here overpopulation and drought are big problems for us too

nomonde ngudo and dr naomi baumslag share a 
dream that might have been impossible to have only a few months ago 
ngudo a black labor relations expert and baumslag a white 
pediatrician want to return to their native south africa in the 
near future and maintain the friendship that has developed since 
theyve been living in the nations capital 
for both women nelson mandelas trip to the united states has 
rekindled hopes that began when south african president fw de 
klerk agreed that reforms are needed and released the black 
nationalist leader from prison after 27 years 
african national congress officials were trying to arrange a 
meeting between some of the areas south african exiles and mandela 
following his arrival in washington on sunday 
i am hoping with this mandela visit new channels will be 
opened up to go back home ngudo said in an interview i am 
really excited he mandela embodies all of our anticipations 
totally 
baumslag also bubbled with excitement in a separate interview 
my heart cries for the country although my feet are here 
she said im glad it movement towards change happened in my 
lifetime so i could see it 
the women say their feelings echo the sentiments of nearly all 
of the estimated 500 to 750 south africans living in the washington 
area 
my main concern is if were all going to be absorbed 
baumslag said of the desire of many to return home she pointed to 
the slow efforts of the whiteruled government to make room for the 
many south africans who want to return to their homeland to help 
put into place the many needed reforms 
baumslag said she also is very nervous about the reluctance 
of the united states to provide south africa with needed resources 
that are absolutely necessary for changes 
ngudo who lived in queenstown south africa said she came to 
america in 1983 to attend indiana university of pennsylvania after 
completing the twoyear labor relations program she worked with 
the united mine workers union 
for political reasons ngudo refused to discuss her family back 
in south africa and why she had not been able to return home but 
she stressed her work with the union here has had positive impact 
in south africa where many blacks work in the gold mines 
baumslag and her husband dr ralph e yodaiken also a south 
african native left the country because they could no longer 
tolerate the poor treatment of the blacks as physicians working in 
many of the segregated black townships they said they constantly 
were faced with conditions they felt compelled to reveal to the 
public 
we were treating preventable conditions that only the blacks 
were exposed to such as diarrhea malnutrition polio and 
rheumatic fever said baumslag we had to choose either to stay 
there and risk going to jail because of the compulsion to buck 
the apartheid system or leave and try to do things from the 
outside 
since coming to america baumslag said she and her husband 
have been able to work with others help with meetings make 
ourselves available as resources and help with students its 
almost like a little family

people in this oncethriving mining town 
say theyve never turned to strangers when times got tough and 
theyre not going to start now 
residents who lost homes and loved ones when a heavy storm sent 
a wall of water crashing down from the appalachian foothills are 
skeptical about help from the government and outside charities 
said mead township trustee gregg warren 
people in this town take care of their own theyve always 
been leery of outsiders said warren whose village of 4300 has 
lost at least 23 lives and scores of homes and businesses from a 
flash flood june 14 ten people are missing 
there was plenty of food clothing and volunteerism here 
before any of these outside organizations came in he said the 
local tv stations have raised a quarter of a million dollars around 
here banks have put up thousands of dollars contractors have 
donated the equipment and labor 
adversity is no stranger to shadyside where the slumping steel 
and coal industries idled many residents who once earned good 
wages and forced others to leave in search of work 
when the coal industry left that was the roughest thing that 
happened to this valley these people have been beaten down and 
now this flood just beats them down even further warren said 
the areas 68 percent unemployment figure is misleading because 
it does not account for people who have been unemployed so long 
theyve exhausted their unemployment benefits warren said 
residents know that sooner or later the government disaster 
relief agencies the american red cross and others will go home and 
they will again be alone to deal with their grief and hardship 
if people in this valley get their lives put back together 
its other people right here who are going to help them get it 
done not nobody from columbus not nobody from washington or 
nowhere else said ben otto whose house along pipe creek was 
severely damaged by the flooding 
robert henry the shadyside local school district 
superintendent said the community would unite to rebuild just as 
it does to grieve 
its a chance for people to pull even closer together henry 
said as about 900 people gathered last week at the high school 
football field for a memorial service for the dead and missing 
weve got to go from where we are and start to rebuild in our 
community the people of shadyside have always responded that way 
residents have not refused government help a federal emergency 
management agency disaster aid center here has received about 350 
applications from people who sustained flood damage said gene 
neiditch who manages the center 
outsiders also have come in large numbers to volunteer their 
services many from hundreds of miles away tommy hause said he and 
his cousin chris hause drove in from mobile ala after reading 
about the flood 
ten years ago we had a hurricane hurricane frederick hit 
our state we had an 11acre farm and it was wiped completely out 
people from ohio were the first to volunteer to help us a group 
came in from springfield ohio and stayed at our place 2 weeks 
doing whatever they could 
i was on vacation and i said well maybe i ought to be up 
there said tommy hause 30 who owns an auto parts store in 
mobile 
people are tired of the reporters and the ohio national guard 
troops who have swarmed into town said raymond ponzo the school 
band director 
people are feeling overwhelmed were such a small town kids 
around here are thrilled when the man from the local paper aims a 
camera at them now theyre seeing themselves on evening network 
news ponzo said 
warren said townspeople need to be left alone now to deal with 
their emotions i realized after i went to the first of these 
funerals that its more important to be with our own than showing 
some reporter around he said

molly cooke happened to be a physician at 
san francisco general hospital in the eye of the aids storm when 
the epidemic blew in a decade ago and if she had it to do over 
again she would 
but some of the 1045 residents she and other researchers 
interviewed at 41 internal medicine programs across the nation are 
so fearful of contracting the deadly virus and so prejudiced 
against the groups of people primarily infected that they want 
nothing to do with aids treatment 
the residents intention to care for hivinfected people was 
low by all measures cooke said some residents would not treat 
to save a life in the face of any seroconversion risk and only 17 
percent of the residents indicated a strong intent to accommodate 
hivinfected people in practice 
distaste for the groups of people disproportionately affected by 
the disease was the one factor that distinguished doctors who had 
no plans to treat hiv and those who did cooke said on saturday in 
her report to the sixth international conference on aids 
some 65 percent of those surveyed agreed with the statement 
most iv drugusing patients with aids have brought the disease on 
themselves fortysix percent agreed with the same statement when 
the phrase gay patients was substituted and 35 percent agreed 
when minority patients filled the blank 
eighty percent of the residents thought that treating aids was 
difficult and more than half were insecure about their ability to 
offer proper social support onequarter believed caring for aids 
patients was unpleasant because they always die 
whats happening is everybodys scared and there are some 
people who have say a high sense of professional duty they say 
i may be scared but this is what doctors do cooke said 
other people have a low sense of professional duty or are very 
prejudiced they say these people are not worth me dealing with 
all this fear about so im going to take myself somewhere else 
where i dont have to feel this anxiety all the time 
cooke said more than half the residents believed that hiv will 
prove to be transmissible in ways now believed to be safe and 
twothirds said they were afraid of being infected on the job 
thirtysix percent said their practices wouldnt be set up to 
accommodate hivinfected patients 
theres a myth that i ran into all the time in the mid80s 
when i would go out and talk to doctors in other hospitals about 
what we were doing she said and what people would say was 
you can do that because somehow at san francisco general youre 
different but it scares us too much 
for years she would reply you shouldnt be scared theres 
nothing to be scared about she finally decided that wasnt true 
i learned to say its very scary cooke said the point 
is not whether youre scared the point is what you do next 
cooke said the researchers plan to follow the residents and find 
out what they actually do when their training is done 
people who are hivinfected already have to deal with a number 
of obstacles to getting care cooke said theres 
discrimination the treatments are expensive the hivinfected 
patients in the second wave have enormous social problems in their 
lives that are impediments to care 
and i think the unwillingness of physicians may be added to 
that list

least 20 years old that have been largely unrestored but preserved 
well enough to serve as models for those doing restoration 
in excellent condition a corvette built between 1963 and 1967 
could fetch up to 100000 says david burroughs president of the 
show 
some custombuilt racing models go even higher five grand sport 
corvettes produced in 1963 exclusively for racing are worth up to 
1 million burroughs says 
next on the mostvaluable list would be the l88 corvette says 
burroughs produced from 1967 to 1969 and also built for racing 
l88s sell for 100000 to 500000 only about 200 of the cars were 
built 
the demand for corvettes is changing though burroughs says 
the vettes of the 1950s are popular with people who grew up then 
but as baby boomers become able to invest in the cars the 196367 
models are becoming more popular 
about 35000 people and as many as 5000 corvettes were expected 
for this years show which concluded sunday with judging and the 
radiocontrolled finals

several hundred adults and children rallied in 
a park across the street from the white house on sunday to protest 
the slow progress in getting federal child care assistance 
legislation enacted 
working families are weary of campaign promises that vow to 
help americas families only to see those promises go 
unfulfilled marian wright edelman president of the childrens 
defense fund told the gathering 
the rally took on a festive atmosphere as red green and yellow 
balloons were distributed to youngsters many of whom munched on 
ice cream bars donated for the event several clowns and a juggler 
performed for the youngsters along with volunteer who told 
childrens stories and sang childrens songs 
ms edelman said the rally was intended for families to have 
some fun together on a sunday afternoon but she also focused on 
the more serious concerns many parents have about inadequate child 
care 
more than half the mothers of children under 2 work outside the 
home and millions of parents have a hard time getting proper 
daycare for their children yet the men in congress and in the 
white house are still dickering about technicalities on a child 
care assistance bill she said 
the house and senate have agreed on parts of a 175 billion 
child care assistance bill but differences remain on some elements 
dealing with tax credits 
the rally featured thousands of paper chain links that had 
been collected in more than 130 cities in 30 states to dramatize 
support for child care legislation organizers of the rally said 
they planned in coming weeks to encircle the white house with the 
paper chain 
president bush was at camp david in maryland during the rally in 
lafayette park across pennsylvania avenue from the white house

for thousands of alaskans venturing into 
the wild to hunt fish and gather plants for food is as much a 
routine part of their daily lives as a trip to the supermarket is 
for most americans 
the right to live off natures bounty in this wildliferich 
state is at the center of a dispute that has the federal government 
poised for an unprecedented takeover of game management in most of 
alaska next week 
the takeover is the result of an alaska supreme court ruling 
that put state and federal laws governing subsistence hunting and 
fishing at odds 
on monday the alaska legislature convenes in special session to 
consider an amendment to the state constitution that would 
guarantee that rural alaskans continue to have first crack at fish 
and game for subsistence uses 
gov steve cowper says the amendment is the only way to avert a 
permanent federal takeover of game management on the twothirds of 
alaska that is federally owned 
in alaska subsistence hunting fishing and gathering is a 
traditional way of life central to the states indian aleut and 
eskimo cultures 
it is the means for them to provide food to feed their 
extended families and their communities said julie kitka 
president of the alaska federation of natives its the core of 
their existence 
but indians aleuts and eskimos comprise fewer than half of the 
estimated 110000 alaskans who take part in subsistence activities 
in much of alaska the absence of stores and roads to the cities 
makes subsistence hunting and fishing a necessity 
subsistence is defined and protected for alaskans in state and 
federal law in fact alaska is the only state that gives 
subsistence use of fish and game the highest priority when 
decisions are made about catch limits and seasons sport and 
commercial hunters and fishermen take a back seat 
subsistence and the way its regulated has been an issue in 
alaska since statehood 31 year ago the states first subsistence 
law was enacted in 1978 and there have been repeated legal 
challenges 
public support for subsistence rights has remained strong 
however an initiative to repeal the subsistence law failed by a 
wide margin in 1982 and a statewide poll in march showed solid 
support for the constitutional amendment 
the latest dispute began in december when the alaska supreme 
court ruled that part of a state law that limits subsistence 
activities to rural residents unconstitutionally discriminates 
against urbanites 
but a federal law the alaska national interest lands 
conservation act of 1980 requires a rural preference as a result 
five federal land agencies plan to assume game management of 
alaskas federal land about 180 million acres on july 1 to 
protect the rural subsistence right 
the takeover which doesnt affect management of the states 
fisheries is expected to lead to considerable confusion among 
hunters as they are faced with differing regulations on alaskas 
patchwork of public lands 
federal land mangers said they were taking over control of the 
wildlife because of the federal requirement for the rural 
preference but they said they were doing so only reluctantly 
because of the complexity of setting hunting seasons bag limits 
and the like over such a wide area 
its the worst jigsaw you can imagine said bruce batten a 
spokesman for the federal fish and wildlife service 
the court had stayed the rulings effective date until july 1 to 
give the state time to find an alternative solution but thus far 
lawmakers have failed to pass a constitutional amendment bill 
some advocate a permit system that would provide subsistence 
rights only to those who meet certain requirements based on 
traditional use and need regardless of where they live 
it seems to me you lose some people out in the bush and gain 
some people in the urban areas said rep robin taylor 
rwrangell and house minority leader i think it would be kind of 
wash 
a group of environmental and sportsmens groups and individual 
plaintiffs in the lawsuit that led to the supreme court ruling 
filed another lawsuit friday seeking to overturn the federal rural 
preference 
if an amendment is not put to voters in november it would be 
two years before the legislature could get another amendment on the 
ballot 
cowper fears that if federal game management is allowed to 
continue past this year it could expand and become more 
restrictive 
by the weekend legislative support for a constitutional 
amendment appeared to be increasing cowper a democrat got help 
from the states allrepublican congressional delegation when it 
endorsed his plan friday 
us sen ted stevens was scheduled to address a joint session 
of the legislature on monday and urge passage of the amendment

a neighbors dispute between a pair of 
lawyers has escalated into a multimilliondollar war of lawsuits 
it began on an afternoon in march 1989 michael rubin 36 a 
personal injury lawyer wanted to take a nap his neighbor kenneth 
schild 47 a tax lawyer wanted to play a little basketball with 
his son before dinner 
schild sayd rubin sprayed him and his son with a hose when they 
wouldnt stop playing basketball rubin doesnt deny that but says 
his nights have become haunted by the fear of being suddenly 
awakened by the obnoxious sounds emanating from his neighbors 
basketball court 
schild sued after rubin allegedly warned that he would enter 
schilds property if necessary to prevent future basketball games 
and rubin has sued not only schild and his wife gail but the 
couples son and daughter ages 13 and 11 their psychologists and 
attorneys 
its very unfortunate but you have someone attacking your 
kids in the back yard said schild he said his lawsuit which 
seeks general damages is to protect his childrens right to play 
safely in their own back yard 
rubins lawsuit against the schilds seeks more than 2 million 
in assorted damages claiming injury in his health strength and 
activity 
a superior court dismissed the lawsuit against the psychologists 
and attorneys last week and ordered rubin to pay 1500 in damages 
to the lawyers but rubin said hell appeal 
rubin also has filed a product liability lawsuit against the 
manufacturer of schilds backyard basketball hoop and has conducted 
sound tests to determine the noise level of bouncing basketballs 
rubin has obtained a restraining order limiting the schilds 
basketball playing schild got one forbidding the rubins from 
coming into contact with them or their guests 
the rubins have videotaped the schilds shooting hoops court 
records show the schilds have videotaped the rubins videotaping 
them 
schild claims in court papers that he has also videotaped rubin 
spraying his son with a hose a second time on april 1 this year 
schild says rubin told his son you play and ill spray you got 
that 
rubin agrees thats what he said 
the two have been unable to settle their dispute out of court 
although both say they dont need the hassle of the embarrassing 
legal battle 
i guess if nothing else its a great opportunity for 
newspapers to make lawyers look silly rubin said

the criminal trial of exxon corp over 
the exxon valdez oil spill has been scheduled for april 1991 more 
than a year after the case was filed and more than two years after 
the tanker ran aground 
us district court judge russel holland said the case is so 
complicated both sides will need an unusual amount of time to 
prepare 
the underlying factual situation is extremely complex and it 
is understood by the court to involve massive quantities of 
documents as well as review of an extensive transcript of a 
related earlier trial holland wrote in an order signed thursday 
holland was referring to the state trial of joseph hazelwood 
the captain who was accused and acquitted of operating the tanker 
under the influence of alcohol when it struck bligh reef on march 
24 1989 
the crippled tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude 
oil in prince william sound fouling miles of shoreline and killing 
many birds otters and other sea animals 
hazelwood was acquitted of the alcohol charge and a felony 
criminal mischief count in march following a twomonth trial 
jurors found hazelwood guilty of a single misdemeanor charge 
reckless discharge of oil 
in the federal indictment against exxon and exxon shipping co 
the government charged the companies with violations of the clean 
water act the refuse act and the migratory bird act 
in addition the companies are accused of violating the ports 
and waterways safety act and the dangerous cargo act by failing to 
make sure that competent people were in charge of the vessel and by 
allowing physically and mentally incompetent people to operate the 
tanker 
in other court papers the government has said the latter 
charges are connected to hazelwoods history of alcohol abuse and 
the limited abilities of seaman robert kagan who was at the helm 
when the tanker failed to complete a maneuver and struck the reef 
exxon attorneys say the charges against the oil company for the 
actions of employees of a subsidiary company are unprecedented 
in his trialsetting order holland agreed at least in part 
saying the case is likely to present novel questions of fact and 
law that will demand more time for trial preparations

from a distance this village on sunday 
looked like just another pile of rocks found on any hillside in 
northern iran 
thursdays devastating earthquake left hardly a building 
standing in the town and killed many of its 2000 residents 
in a nearby field army bulldozers dug communal graves which 
soldiers filled with hundreds of bodies and amid an overpowering 
stench hurriedly covered them with soil 
the graves were shallow because we did not expect so many 
bodies said one army sergeant on condition of anonymity 
a few survivors gathered around the graves and many wailed in 
grief for relatives and friends 
the scene in manjil a farming and fishing community on the 
banks of an artificial lake 125 miles northwest of tehran was 
reminiscent of old photographs of devastation during world war ii 
only occasional telephone poles and parts of some buildings were 
left standing a large mural portrait of late revolutionary 
patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini half his face reduced to 
rubble loomed above the remains of a house 
similar scenes of devastation and tales of grief were reported 
throughout the afflicted region after the quake which by some 
accounts killed 50000 people 
the islamic republic news agency quoted a survivor from abbor 
village in zanjan province as saying so many people perished 
under the rubble the bodies have not been retrieved or buried 
the whole area is stinking because of the decaying corpses 
which make rescue operations even more difficult the survivor 
identified as ahmad ali said 
another survivor identified only as soleyman from kopteh 
another village in zanjan said dont ask me how many are dead 
ask how many survived only me my son and a woman from my village 
my survival was a miracle because tons and tons of rocks slid 
from mountain peaks and buried the village and all the villagers 
livestock and orchards are under mountains of rock and rubble he 
said

the head of the us naval academy wants 
new female students to know the institution will not tolerate 
incidents like the recent handcuffing of a woman to a urinal 
rear adm virgil l hill jr wrote to incoming female midshipmen 
to extend his personal commitment to the protection of their 
civil rights here lt cmdr mark van dyke academy spokesman 
said late last week 
the letters dated june 1 were mailed to the women who on july 
3 will begin their military careers at the academy van dyke said 
the academy this year accepted 136 of 170 female applicants 
male candidates for the class of 1994 were not sent letters van 
dyke said about 1000 students are in each class 
van dyke said hill was concerned about the adverse publicity the 
academy received with reports of the handcuffing of former 
secondyear midshipman 2nd class gwen marie dreyer 
dreyer 19 resigned in april to protest the punishment meted 
out to male classmates who dragged her from her room handcuffed 
her to the urinal and snapped photos two male midshipmen were 
penalized with loss of leave time and demerits and six others were 
issued written reprimands 
van dyke said hills letters congratulated the incoming women on 
being accepted to the academy and explained the circumstances of 
the dreyer case noting that the male midshipmen responsible were 
severely punished 
hill also indicates in his letter that he did not feel the 
news coverage accurately conveyed his disgust over what happened 
and that the academy will not condone this behavior van dyke 
said 
the case triggered national media coverage and congressional and 
navy inquiries into student hazing and sexual harrassment at the 
academy 
last month the academy toughened its rules so any midshipman 
found guilty of physical abuse of a plebe will be expelled 
previously midshipmen were expelled for the more narrowly defined 
hazing 
in the dreyer case a hearing panel found the male midshipmen 
had not planned the action they took and it therefore was not 
hazing the new rules also call for increased demerits and 
restrictions for forcing a fellow middie to engage in horseplay

sunday as they spent an anxious weekend on the threshold of 
enormous change 
next sunday the former communist country will merge its economy 
with west germany a momentous event that will have an immediate 
effect on the lives of the nations 16 million people 
leftwing radicals tried to attack the east berlin headquarters 
of a neonazi group saturday the latest in a series of extremist 
clashes in recent months that some officials call a byproduct of 
the social upheaval under way 
authorities said 21 police officers were badly injured in the 
rioting and east german interior minister petermichael diestel 
called for tougher laws against extremist acts 
prime minister lothar de maiziere urged the nation to stay calm 
and condemned extremist violence as an affront to the peaceful 
revolt that toppled the former communist government last fall 
right extremist power must not be combated through violent 
left extremism he said in a statement the basis for the 
democratization of our land was the peaceful protest of the people 
so must it remain 
east germanys currency will be changed to west german marks 
sunday which marks the former socialist nations official 
immersion into the free market and a major step toward full 
unification with west germany 
banks stayed open all weekend to allow customers to fill out 
applications to change their savings to west german marks and 
thousands of people stood in lines 
to keep the powerful west german mark from being weakened by the 
abrupt expansion of the money supply east germans will only be 
able to convert 2000 marks 1210 of their savings to west 
marks during the first month of economic union 
some already were receiving checks for that money which they 
will be able to cash sunday 
were going to buy a car said margit schollain 32 as she 
waited with more than a thousand other people in lines that snaked 
from a bank on east berlins leipziger street

mozambicans and other foreigners live has become a flashpoint for 
extremist violence 
diestel said in a statement sunday the government should ban 
such radical groups and give the police broader powers to battle 
extremists 
resentment of foreign workers in east germany has been growing 
the country is expected to face massive unemployment as its former 
state enterprises compete with more efficient western companies 
that already are flooding the country 
on leipziger street west germanys mayer food chain already has 
renovated a building just 50 yards from a dowdier looking east 
german store the new store is to open its doors next week 
it is too expensive said martin ibold 31 as he waited in

will take their west german marks and buy a lot of things 
but i have two children and another coming probably this 
week he said gesturing to his pregnant wife i just need the

sen dave durenberger was cautioned by his 
attorney in 1986 about accepting government reimbursement for stays 
in a minneapolis condominium according to documents despite his 
contention this month that he had no reason to doubt the propriety 
of the plan 
durenberger rminn collected 40055 in per diem payments 
from the senate from 1983 to 1989 for staying in the condominium 
he was part owner from 1983 to 1987 and says he sold the facility 
in april 1987 a deal called a sham by the special counsel for the 
senate ethics committee 
the propriety of durenberger accepting reimbursement for staying 
in the condominium with a bedroom bathroom kitchen and sitting 
area is one of the principal areas of investigation for the 
senate panel 
after a 15month investigation of alleged financial 
irregularities by the 55yearold republican the committee soon 
will decide whether he willfully violated the rules and deserves 
punishment 
the committees special counsel robert s bennett argued in 
triallike hearings june 12 and june 13 that durenberger misled the 
senate first bennett said durenberger hid his part ownership of 
the condominium as he collected reimbursements from 198387 and 
then he engineered a phony sale to the company owned by his former 
campaign manager to keep the reimbursement money flowing from 1987 
to 1989 
it wasnt until december 1989 that durenberger formally sought 
the senates advice on the propriety of the reimbursements after a 
story in the star tribune newspaper in minneapolis raised 
questions the rules panel said 11005 of the reimbursements were 
improper and durenberger repaid the money the ethics committee 
will determine the legality of the remaining 29050 
three years before durenberger asked for a senate ruling his 
personal attorney michael c mahoney advised the senator in late 
1986 that he couldnt find any support for the reimbursements 
the lawmaker had been receiving since 1983 mahoney recalled the 
advice in statements to the ethics committee now part of its 
official record 
the documents made public in the ethics committee probe also 
show that seven months after lawyer mahoney issued his caution in 
june 1987 durenberger confided to friends in a personal letter 
that he believed he had relied on shaky or misleading legal 
advice when he set up the condominium partnership in 1983 
in his appearance before the committee june 13 the senator 
conceded that rules had been broken but insisted he never intended 
to commit violations 
durenberger said the strains and vulnerabilities in his 
personal life affected his decisions including heavy education and 
medical expenses the loss of his first wife to cancer and the 
burdens of his current wife penny whose first husband was killed 
in vietnam 
the senator told the committee that all the key decisions on 
the condominium were made by his lawyers defense attorney jim 
hamilton argued there was no warning for six years that 
anything was improper 
durenberger spokeswoman lois west asked to comment on the 
documents responded we arent going to try to argue our case in 
the press 
durenbergers june 1987 letter was written to a former campaign 
chairman gene holderness and former law partner paul magnuson 
now a us district judge 
he wrote for the last five years i have had the benefit of 
renting my former condominium at 1225 lasalle from a partnership 
with businessman roger scherer i now discover that my legal 
advice was either shaky or misleading 
bennett the ethics committee lawyer said durenberger misled 
the senate when he and scherer each placed a condominium into their 
joint venture and named it the 703603 association not using the 
senators name durenberger rented the condominium from the 
association 
bennett further said that the 1987 sale to the firm headed by 
durenbergers excampaign manager paul overgaard was engineered 
solely to continue the reimbursements the transaction documents 
show was an oral agreement and final papers were not signed until 
october 1989 after overgaard threatened to cancel the deal due to 
the delays 
durenberger said he bought the condominium in 1979 but when it 
became too costly in 1983 he placed it in the partnership with 
scherer a former minnesota state legislator and a businessman he 
said he made the deal with overgaard after scherer said he was 
backing out of the partnership 
durenberger said he made the 1983 ownership change because a 
political adviser told him he could qualify for senate 
reimbursements by renting the condominium or staying in a hotel 
but not if he owned the residence 
in fact senate rules are unclear on how ownership affects 
reimbursements when a senator stays in his home state 
in an interview with ethics committee lawyers in april 1989 
mahoney stated our advice was we cant confirm nor could we 
deny that durenberger was correct in his interpretation that the 
rules allowed the reimbursements we simply couldnt find any 
support for it 
in his defense durenberger pointed to a legal opinion he was 
given june 28 1983 by another lawyer randall e johnson 
johnsons sworn statement to the committee on june 7 said he 
advised durenberger seven years ago that under senate rules i 
believed he could claim reimbursement for official business stays 
at the condominium that he rented from the partnership

the church of ireland ordained 
two women as priests sunday joining anglicans in seven other 
countries in taking a step resisted by the mother church of england 
the rt rev samuel poyntz bishop of down and connor ordained 
irene templeton and kathleen young in an afternoon ceremony in st 
annes cathedral they became the first women priests in the united 
kingdom 
mrs templeton 49 of the belfast suburb of dunmurray is 
married and has a 5yearold son mrs young 50 of carrickfergus 
is widowed 
four men also were ordained 
both women had previously been ordained deacons which is the 
highest post women may hold in the church of england mrs young 
had been a paid curate in carrickfergus while mrs templeton was 
unsalaried 
the church of irelands general synod decided may 17 to admit 
women to the ranks of priests and bishops 
it became the seventh anglican province to ordain women 
following the united states canada new zealand brazil kenya 
and uganda 
the ordinations in ireland may have a greater impact on the 
church of england because priests ordained by the church of 
ireland like those of the scottish episcopal church and the church 
in wales are not classified as overseas clergy by the church of 
england 
at the time of the synod vote the irish times of dublin said in 
an editorial that the ordination of women as anglican priests may 
come to be remembered as one of the landmarks in the liberation of 
women in ireland this was a brave vote which places the 
church of ireland not only at the forefront of liberal thinking in 
ireland but at the forefront of liberal thinking in the anglican 
community 
earlier this month the spiritual heead of the anglican church 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie said he expected to see 
women ordained by the church of england within a decade 
ecclesia a newsletter published by a conservative 
anglocatholic organization in hull england denounced the church 
of ireland as a protestant sect that can no longer claim the 
allegiance of catholics 
according to the church of england newspaper ecclesia contended 
that future irish anglican ordinations will be invalid

sometimes programming is the worst enemy of jazz 
festivals 
take saturday nights lineup at one concert of the jvc jazz 
festival the world saxophone quartet a powerhouse jazz outfit 
was paired with steve reich and his disciples followers of 
minimalist music 
talk of an odd couple 
in the old days at newport the rhode island forebear of this 
annual big apple festival such a pairing would have been laughed 
off aquidneck island 
maybe those in charge thought this kind of eclectic bill would 
attract a large new york audience if so they were wrong but 
adding a solid jazz group and deleting the minimalists might have 
filled the place and created a night worth remembering 
although the program indicated the saxophonists would play the 
second half they came on first they were wise they didnt have 
to hang around backstage listening to reichs futuristic but 
joyless stuff 
the quartet arthur blythe oliver lake david murray hamiet 
bluiett impressed the carnegie hall crowd with their skillful 
playing their feeling for their music much of which theyve 
composed themselves 
this is no kind of ersatz allstar group in which each player 
has a starring role but the group as a whole is only passablethe 
four saxophonists clearly respect each other and enjoy their 
collaboration 
in solos and together they explored the saxophones full range 
its hotness and coolness its chaos and simplicity 
and what a pleasure to hear jazz without all the electronics 
this is the way jazz should be played whether in preservation hall 
in new orleans or in a new york concert hall 
unfortunately for some in the audience the world saxophone 
quartets set lasted only 45 minutes steve reich and his musicians 
played only two pieces one of which ran an hour by itself at the 
end the listener wondered what did this new age music have to do 
with a jazz festival 
the jvc jazz festival sponsored by the japanese electronics 
firm runs in new york through saturday and then goes to saratoga 
springs ny

japan surpassed the united states to become the 
biggest donor of government aid to the third world in 1989 the 
organization for economic cooperation and development said monday 
the achievement could soften criticism that japan with its 
immense financial strength has not done its share to help 
developing countries 
japans total aid effort in 1989 was 9 billion compared with 
77 billion for the us the parisbased organization of 
industrial democracies said in a report 
the us figure represented a decline of 27 percent from 1988 
after adjusting for inflation 
the decline meant that us aid as a share of gross national 
product declined from 021 percent in 1988 to 015 percent last 
year the worst performance among the organizations main aid 
donor countries 
joseph wheeler chairman of the groups development assistance 
committee told a news conference sunday that us aid to the third 
world has fallen steadily in recent years 
but wheeler said he expects the us will lift its aid effort to 
at least 9 billion this year he said us contributions to 
multilateral aid institutions should return to normal levels in 
1990 and substantial new aid programs in central america are 
likely 
but this probably wont be enough to enable the us to regain 
its number one slot wheeler said since japan plans to spend at 
least 31 billion on aid over the next three years 
wheeler said government assistance to developing countries from 
all sources in 1989 totalled 513 billion scarecely changed from 
the yearearlier figure of 517 billion the total flow including 
private funds and export credits to these countries is estimated 
at 109 billion up 45 percent from 1988 
wheeler said the aid effort of the international groups 18 
richest countries has increased in real terms at an average rate of 
29 percent a year or a total of about 33 percent in the past 
decade 
wheeler said the aid effort of western industrialized nations in 
1989 wasnt affected by assistance to eastern europe most donor 
countries have indicated future aid to eastern europe wont be 
diverted from traditional aid recipients he said 
the group said scandinavian countries continued to provide the 
most official aid last year as a percentage of gnp led by norway 
with 102 percent 
the member nations are australia austria belgium britain 
canada denmark finland france greece iceland ireland italy 
japan luxembourg the netherlands new zealand norway portugal 
spain sweden switzerland turkey the united states and west 
germany 
the third biggest donor in dollars after japan and the us 
was france with 514 billion followed by west germany with 495 
billion

according to a newspaper close to president hashemi rafsanjani 
official radio put the death toll at 48000 
army mountaineers climbed peaks in the rugged region in an 
effort to rescue villagers trapped in remote hamlets following 
thursdays earthquake the official islamic republic news agency

based in new canaan conn 
it was the first overt us shipment of its kind to be accepted 
by iran since the hostage crisis of 1980 when 52 american hostages 
were held at the us embassy in tehran for 444 days the two 
nations have no diplomatic ties 
in washington the state department said a red cross charter 
flight carrying supplies donated by the us government was 
scheduled to arrive in tehran late sunday 
earlier the radical newspaper jomhuri islami urged that no help 
be accepted from the united states and other countries whose hands 
are stained with the blood of the iranian people 
the foreign ministry however said that due to the magnitude 
of the disaster iran would accept all such aid 
iran accepts the assistance of all foreign countries except 
israel and south africa tehran radio quoted deputy foreign 
minister ali mohammad besharati as saying 
there were conflicting death tolls the tehran times the 
nations leading englishlanguage newspaper quoted an unidentified 
senior relief official as saying 50000 people died and 200000 
were injured in the quake 
he said even that was a conservative estimate because the 
figures are quoted taking account only of those who have been 
registered officially as dead or wounded many victims were not 
counted he said 
in geneva senior un relief official mhamed essaafi also 
estimated the toll would reach 50000 dead and 200000 wounded

mountaintops and in inacessible valleys under tons of rocks 
cutting off the routes with the outside world 
in rudbar dozens of iranian military helicopters flew relief 
supplies into makeshift airstrips on a small island in a river that 
flows through the agricultural city

a cargo jet carrying us aid for iranian 
earthquake victims arrived sunday becoming the first private 
american relief mission to this country after more than a decade of 
bitter relations 
to be on the ground here in tehran is a very special feeeling 
for us said stephen m johnson president of americares a 
private us relief organization based in new canaan conn 
we are trying to fulfill the needs of the iranian government 
americares flew in 84000 pounds of supplies to tehran after the 
iranian government said it would accept humanitarian assistance 
from the united states for victims of thursdays devastating 
earthquake in northwestern iran 
in washington renee bafalis a spokeswoman for the us agency 
for international development said a red cross charter flight 
carrying supplies donated by the us government was scheduled to 
arrive in tehran late sunday 
the quake killed 50000 people and wounded 200000 according to 
a senior iranian official quoted in the englishlanguage tehran 
times official radio put the death toll at 48000 
the us relief shipment included everything from bandages and 
antiseptic burn cream to orange slices in syrup and tents with 
builtin fiberglass frames 
the cargo palletes heaped with supplies each bore an american 
flag and a handlettered sign in farsi reading from the american 
people to the iranian people with very great affection and love we 
offer you these things 
americares officials said they received scores of telephone 
calls both opposing and supporting the relief effort even before 
the shipment left connecticut on saturday 
some callers criticized the group for helping iran saying the 
islamic government would not return the favor if the situation was 
reversed and americans were suffering 
the us relief shipment also had critics in iran the radical 
newspaper jomhuri islami urged sunday that no help be accepted from 
the united states and other countries whose hands are stained 
with the blood of the iranian people 
but the foreign ministry said sunday iran would accept all aid 
due to the magnitude of the disaster 
the us shipment was the first of its kind to be accepted by 
iran since the hostage crisis of 197980 when 52 americans were 
held at the us embassy in tehran for 444 days 
iran is also believed to have influence with the shiite moslem 
extremists holding 16 western hostages including six americans in 
lebanon the longestheld is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
but americares officials said the scope of the human disaster in 
northwestern iran meant that political differences had to be put 
aside 
its a disaster we havent seen the likes of even in 
armenia said johnson referring to the december 1988 quake in 
the soviet republic of armenia that killed an estimated 25000 
people 
when you have a disaster of this magnitude you have to set 
aside differences and come on over and help said doyt l conn a 
project director for americares 
the iranian air force ground staff at the miltary field in 
tehran where the supplies were unloaded seemed slightly taken aback 
at the amount of aid 
ducking into the planes cargo deck to confirm that the 
americans had indeed brought emergency supplies they emerged 
grinning 
thank you said one officer on condition of anonymity the 
quake area is like a leveled graveyard its terrible 
the americares group praised the speed with which the plane was 
unloaded but was not told how the supplies would be distributed 
the americans waited on the ground for about four hours hoping 
that someone from the iranian red crescent society the equivalent 
of the red cross would come to greet them 
but nobody showed up after a slight delay in collecting their 
passports the americans departed expecting to return to the 
united states by early monday

the citys zodiac gunman became a killer 
sunday when a 78yearold man died 3 weeks after he was shot in 
the back by the letterwriting attacker a hospital administrator 
said 
joseph proce the third of four people the gunman shot went 
into cardiac arrest at jamaica general hospital at 1025 am and 
died about 40 minutes later said administrator ole pedersen 
proce who walked with a cane was shot in the back as he walked 
near his queens home on may 31 he lost a kidney and never left the 
hospitals surgical intensive care unit pedersen said 
a note was discovered near the street where proce was shot it 
read simply zodiac time to die the gunman also wrote 
police the third sign is dead on may 31 1990 204 am white old 
man with a cane shoot in front of house 
police believe the victims have been chosen because of their 
birthdates proce was a taurus born may 20 1912 
the zodiac victims also are vulnerable besides proce they have 
been a 50yearold man who used a cane to steady a childhood limp 
a 33yearold man who was drunk and a sleeping homeless man 
the zodiac gunman has written letters to news media and police 
detailing the shootings which began in march in a november letter 
to police zodiac threatened to kill 12 people one for each 
astrological sign 
the latest shooting was before dawn thursday when larry 
parnham a 30yearold homeless man was wounded as he slept on a 
central park bench 
the police zodiac task force was doubled to nearly 50 officers 
chief of detectives joseph borrelli said friday 
the latest victim apparently was chosen and stalked because of 
his astrological sign police said the other three each had 
different signs but authorities didnt know whether the attacker 
knew that before they were shot 
parnham told detectives that days before the shooting he was 
befriended by a stranger who asked him his birth date borrelli 
said 
detectives fear the gunman may stalk future victims the same 
way and urged new yorkers to beware of strangers asking their 
birth dates 
a note claiming responsibility for the central park shooting was 
received friday by the new york post the gunman also has claimed 
responsibility for the other shootings which took place in march 
and may in an eightblock workingclass section straddling the 
brooklynqueens borough line 
the latest note appeared identical to an earlier one sent to the 
paper by the gunman said post editor jerry nachman four similar 
notes have been found one sent to police one to the cbs show 60 
minutes and two left with shooting victims 
all but one of the notes start with the words this is the 
zodiac and three contain the phrase the twelve sign will die 
when the belts in the heaven are seen 
the birth dates of the other three victims correspond to 
astrological signs scrawled in the gunmans notes borrelli said 
the notes recalled david berkowitz who killed six young men and 
women and wounded seven others in new york city in 1976 and 1977 
he wrote letters to newspapers about the killing signed son of 
sam 
the case also recalls the san francisco zodiac killer who 
in a series of letters took responsibility for 40 murders since 
the 1960s unlike berkowitz he was never captured 
in the latest letter to the post the gunman claimed to be the 
same man who terrorized california police do not believe that 
astrologers had warned police that the first day of summer when 
the central park shooting occurred was considered a significant 
day because the zodiac changed from the sign of gemini to the sign 
of cancer 
a note sent to police and dated nov 19 1989 written by the 
gunman threatened to kill 12 people and warned when the 
zodiacal light is seen zodiac will spread fear 
the zodiacal light is the diffuse glow seen in the west after 
twilight and in the east before dawn since march 8 the gunman has 
struck during the predawn hours on thursdays at 21day intervals 
except for a gap of 63 days between his second and third victims

ground searchers reached the site by afternoon fournier said 
and federal aviation officials would investigate the crash 
the plane disappeared from radar screens around midnight monday 
heading into the greenville area near moosehead lake the 
disappearance did not prompt a search because it happens frequently 
in the mountainous area officials said 
fournier said moynihan had indicated to air traffic control that 
he was having trouble activating the runway lights at many small 
airstrips an approaching pilot activates the runway lights by 
radio 
a controller asked the pilot at least twice if he could see the 
runway lights and he answered no fournier said adding that 
the pilot might have been too far from the runway or his view 
impaired by the dense forest 
lt carter smith of the warden service said investigators 
believe the pilot was preoccupied with the landing lights and 
trying to focus on two or three different things while flying 
at a considerable speed 
the plane was exactly where the radar showed it dropping off 
the scope smith said of the wreckage they definitely were too 
low it would appear that the left wing caught on a tree 
in boston fbi agent stephen morrill said cavanagh was traveling 
to a training mission state police maj robert morse said the two 
men may have combined plans for a training session with a rafting 
excursion 
faa spokesman mike ciccarelli said moynihan received a weather 
briefing monday night for a flight from worcester mass to 
greenville 
when the pair did not arrive in greenville those they were to 
meet assumed they canceled travel plans because of stormy weather

the head of the us civil rights commission 
said sunday he had been unable to convince president bush that a 
proposed civil rights bill would not lead to racial hiring quotas 
but arthur fletcher said he hoped bush would back away from a 
threat to veto the civil rights act of 1990 unless it is modified 
fletcher who appeared on nbctvs meet the press program 
with jesse jackson was asked whether he believed bush would veto 
the legislation fletcher responded i hope not but he added 
i cant tell you what the president is going to do 
the bill is designed to overcome a series of supreme court 
decisions last year that made it more difficult for workers to sue 
employers for alleged job discrimination 
but the bush administration has sought changes in the measure 
cosponsored by sen edward m kennedy dmass and rep augustus 
f hawkins dcalif the bill may be brought up for senate 
consideration this week a similar version still awaits judiciary 
committee approval before being cleared for debate in the house 
the administration has claimed that the bill as drafted would 
in effect force businesses to resort to hiring quotas to reduce 
their exposure to lawsuits backers deny that the bill requires 
quotas either directly or indirectly 
the white house has said it is willing to compromise although 
some republican leaders have expressed doubts that an accord can be 
reached 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said last week that bush 
wants a bill he can sign 
but fletcher appointed by bush in february said the commission 
voted 71 last week to support the legislation however the 
commission wants included a statement that there is no intention to 
force quotas 
fletcher said he had tried to convince administration officials 
that the bill as drafted would not do so 
i obviously havent convinced them yet but we dont know 
the language in the bill yet when we finally see what that says 
well know whether there is a propensity for quotas or not he 
said 
gop leaders have urged top congressional democrats not to bring 
the bill to the senate floor during the us visit of south african 
antiapartheid leader nelson mandela the african national congress 
official arrived last week and was scheduled to be in washington 
from sunday through tuesday he has other us appearances 
scheduled through saturday 
on another matter jackson was asked if he would run for 
president in 1992 
its a matter that is worthy of serious consideration given 
the favor that weve gained among the public said jackson who 
unsuccessfully sought the democratic presidential nomination in 
1984 and 1988 but its too early to make that decision

japanese and us trade officials met monday for 
talks on barriers to trade and investment that were expected to 
center on tokyos public works spending officials said 
negotiators tackled japans land use policies the foreign 
ministry said in a statement us officials say the policies have 
contributed to higher real estate prices that prevent foreign firms 
from setting up business here 
before the talks began japanese officials indicated they would 
push the united states to cut its federal budget deficit us 
officials meanwhile said they hoped japan would agree to increase 
public works spending 
both nations agree the government should do more to improve the 
quality of life in japan and in turn encourage more imports but 
they differ widely over exactly how much more spending tokyo should 
promise in the talks 
prime minister toshiki kaifu has endorsed a 268 trillion 
10year public works package 
but deputy us trade representative linn williams and other 
us officials say that figure would not result in a sizable fall 
in japans current account surplus they say japan should spend 
onetenth of its gross national product each year on public 
investment instead of the current 6 percent to 7 percent 
williams in an interview with kyodo news service here said he 
would be satisfied if japan committed itself to spending at least 
323 trillion over 10 years 
japanese officials acknowledge the need here for better 
airports roads sewers and parks but they oppose committing a set 
percentage of gnp to such projects because it would limit the 
governments flexibility 
economists say japans booming economy has a limited capacity to 
absorb a significant increase in public spending without 
stimulating inflation 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
talks which began monday were to finetune the wording of a final 
report media reports said disagreements remained over details of 
measures to be adopted 
both sides hope to complete the final report before the summit 
of seven major industrialized nations begins in houston on july 9 
president bush proposed the talks dubbed the structural 
impediments initiative last july to help cut japans massive 
trade imbalance with the united states 
the talks are aimed at reforming business practices and policies 
that are believed to act as structural trade and investment 
barriers 
in an interim report in april washington committed itself to 
cutting the federal budget deficit encouraging savings curbing 
excessive consumption and improving worker training and education 
japan said it would ease rules on opening retail stores crack 
down on allegedly unfair business practices by corporate groups 
consider revising land use policies to help reduce inflated real 
estate prices and increase public works

four roman catholic bishops held a 
cordial but noncommittal meeting with a delegation of former 
priests who were stripped of their duties because they married and 
who want to return to work 
the hourlong exchange came saturday during a retreat for about 
200 members of the national conference of catholic bishops 
they listened and took notes said terry dosh one of five 
former priests at the meeting none of us got our hopes up that 
anything could happen immediately were realists 
the four bishops including pierre dumaine of the san jose 
diocese agreed to take the request to their national committees 
for further discussion at least one bishop appeared to support the 
former priests cause 
within the framework of the discipline of the church which 
has served the church well over the centuries these men should be 
encouraged to put their life experience at the churchs service 
bishop donald wuerl of pittsburgh said in a prepared statement 
the former priests are members of a minneapolisbased group 
called corpus or the corps of reserve priests united for service 
which held an annual meeting over the weekend at san jose state 
university 
the group claims about 10000 members about half of them 
priests who married and are no longer allowed to serve 
the meeting with the bishops was the first since the 1978 
election of pope john paul ii who opposes letting married priests 
or women celebrate mass or perform other priestly duties 
corpus president anthony padovano said the group tried before to 
meet with bishops without success corpus hopes the church will 
reconsider the ban on married priests this fall at an international 
meeting of bishops in rome 
despite its insistence on a celibate clergy the church in 
recent years has allowed married episcopal priests to convert to 
roman catholicism remain married and celebrate mass hear 
confessions and perform other priestly duties 
thats a double standard said guy murning who was ordained 
as a roman catholic priest in 1970 but left eight years later to 
get married

nelson mandela criticized us aid to 
noncommunist guerrillas in angola on sunday shortly after he 
arrived in washington for meetings with president bush and 
congressional leaders 
the pointed remarks were a sure sign that the african leaders 
threeday visit to the us capital will have a decidedly more 
businesslike flavor than his first four days in the united states 
which were marked by a round of enthusiastic rallies and 
appearances that drew hundreds of thousands of supporters in new 
york and boston 
it is here where mandela must make his case for continued us 
economic sanctions against south africas government and press 
other items on his political agenda 
during an unusual 20minute questionandanswer session with 
reporters and editors from blackowned media concerns mandela said 
the united states should not be providing assistance to jonas 
savimbi a guerrilla fighter seeking to overthrow the angolan 
government 
the united states and south africa are the main countries that 
support savimbi he said we strongly condemn that because 
independent countries should respect the political sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of angola and no assistance should be 
rendered to savimbi 
although questions were limited to representatives of 
blackowned media other reporters were allowed to monitor the 
event 
mandela said he had not broached the subject of angola with 
south africas white government and he refused to divulge what he 
is going to tell bush when they meet monday 
nevertheless mandela was explicit in saying no assistance 
should be given savimbis rebels who have waged war for nearly 20 
years against the soviet and cubanbacked angolan government 
several of the reporters who were allowed to ask questions 
praised mandela and asked what they could do to help the 
antiapartheid struggle 
apartheid is still there mandela said it is therefore 
necessary for you to continue to put pressure on your government 
and congress to continue sanctions 
moreover he said the african national congress with 20000 
exiles and enormous financial needs for new programs must have 
money take part in the campaign to raise funds for the anc 
mandela said 
in a lighter vein when one reporter asked about his health the 
71yearold leader said why dont you arrange a ball a dance 
and take me on 
asked whether he could control militant anc youth in south 
africa mandela acknowledged they are militant but that they also 
are highly disciplined and take orders from their leaders 
he showed no bitterness about having spent 27 years in jail 
saying he didnt want to dwell on the past let bygones be 
bygones he said when asked specifically about reports that the 
cia had helped arrange his arrest in the early 1960s 
when one of the reporters asked mandela whether he would help 
end vestiges of racism in the united states the south african 
responded we are prepared to be guided by the black leadership 
at a brief airport arrival ceremony earlier mandela had said he 
was greatly encouraged by his rousing reception in the united 
states 
i come here to put the message out that sanctions must be 
intensified and to ask for resources so we could be able to 
address the problems that are facing our country today said the 
anc deputy president 
we have been greatly encouraged by the rousing reception which 
the american people in new york and boston have given us they have 
left us with the distinct impression that in this country we have 
our brothers and sisters who are committed to the fight against 
racial oppression in our country mandela said 
mandela noted that recent concessions by south african president 
fw de klerk have raised the hope for peace but he said the 
government yielded not because of a change of heart but because 
of the pressure put on the government inside the country and of the 
international community generally 
before getting down to business the mandela motorcade took the 
scenic route into town from national airport winding across the 
potomac river and past the lincoln memorial and the washington 
monument there was little traffic on the streets and no crowds 
lining the way 
once he reached the madison hotel however manela was greeted 
by hundreds of people lined up behind ropes on the sidewalk across 
the street from the hotel some danced and waved banners security 
was tight 
his only other announced events sunday were a reception for 
african diplomats and a visit to a meeting between anc members and 
south african exiles living in the washington area both were 
closed to reporters 
mandelas wife winnie attended a church service sunday 
afternoon to honor south african women 
washington mayor marion barry on trial on drug and perjury 
charges was not present at airport welcoming ceremonies but leila 
mcdowell of the communications company helping with the mandela 
arrangements said the mayor was invited she said the mayor said he 
would not be able to attend because of his trial barrys wife and 
son were among those greeting mandela 
on monday mandela meets with bush and secretary of state james 
a baker iii on tuesday he becomes one of only a handful of 
private citizens who have addressed a joint session of congress 
mr mandela is a working statesman said roger wilkins 
national coordinator of mandelas visit this is a visit to 
official washington really 
during his threeday stay he also will speak to 19000 people 
at a soldout rally at the washington convention center and visit 
labor leaders 
in advance of mandelas arrival assistant secretary of state 
herman cohen told reporters that bush and other us officials are 
eager to hear mandelas view on how he envisions a postapartheid 
society in south africa 
the main emphasis of the meeting with bush is negotiations 
and how to we help promote negotiations cohen said 
the anc and the de klerk government held their first talks last 
month over obstacles to negotiations for a new constitution 
mandela has said the next problem to resolve is who sits at the 
negotiating table 
cohen said that among the questions us officials have for 
mandela is what would be the format for negotiations what are his 
constitutional ambitions for south africa and what are his economic 
models 
the united states also disagrees with mandelas unbridled 
support for cuban leader fidel castro libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi and palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat 
mandela says he wont criticize their human rights records because 
theyve been strong backers of the antiapartheid movement 
jesse jackson who is promoting mandelas visit said sunday on 
nbctvs meet the press program that mandelas support for 
castro must be put in an african context castro sent cuban troops 
to help drive south africans out of angola jackson noted 
cohen said the united states cant relax sanctions which 
include a ban on new us investment in south africa and a trade 
embargo on items such as oil and agricultural products until the 
white government meets a list of conditions set out in the 1986 
comprehensive antiapartheid act 
de klerk has satisfied all of those conditions with the 
exception of two releasing all political prisoners and lifting a 
state of emergency in the natal province where anc members are 
waging a bloody political battle with the supporters of chief 
mangosuthu buthelezi who heads the zuludominated inkatha movement

a new slate of officers for the 
nations oldest hispanic advocacy group was elected by acclamation 
sunday during a raucous convention that ended with a pledge of 
unity 
we will work together said jose velez after he was sworn in 
as president 
the league of united latin american citizens which has 110000 
members is the nations oldest and largest hispanic advocacy 
organization 
its 61st annual convention held here this week was rife with 
accusations of votebuying and election fraud 
proceedings were stopped often during sundays general assembly 
as delegates tried to shout each other down over parliamentary 
procedure 
disgruntled supporters of outgoing twoterm president jose 
garcia de lara accused velez a las vegas entrepreneur of buying 
the presidency 
velez supporters said de lara a san antonio texas architect 
used heavyhanded tactics to maintain power like suspending and 
expelling members 
but both camps called the convention atmosphere standard lulac 
operating procedure and a healthy expression of the democratic 
process 
sometimes latinos are so americanized that they do the same 
things democrats and republicans do arnold torres lulac 
national political adviser said friday 
sundays real battle centered on whether 43 recently formed 
local councils made up primarily of velez supporters would be 
able to vote 
most of the local councils are made up of filipinoamericans 
from california and the de lara supporters argued that lulacs 
constitution says the bodies must be at least twothirds hispanic 
they said velezs effort to bring in the filipinoamerican 
contingent amounted to votebuying 
velez supporters countered that de lara was trying to limit his 
opponents backing by keeping the councils out 
after hours of unruly debate a roll call vote was ordered 
sunday afternoon to decide the council question 
about 40 votes before the tally would have been final de lara 
suddenly appeared on stage and withdrew his candidacy saying 
the people have spoken 
with a graciousness rarely seen during the fourday convention 
de lara pledged his full support to velez as the two men stood 
arminarm 
one by one all other incumbents then withdrew 
at a news conference later velez said an early order of 
business would be returning lulacs national headquarters to 
washington dc from san antonio 
velez also said he would investigate all suspensions and 
expulsions under de lara and review all lawsuits in which lulac is 
involved

a 2yearold boy who spent all but seven 
weeks of his life in a coma after a severe beating by his mother 
has died after his father allowed the hospital to turn off life 
support machinery 
a coroner said sunday that the boys death was a homicide that 
resulted from the december 1987 beating 
this was the most difficult decision of my life david m 
crane said in a statement his son leslie michael crane died 
saturday 
hospital officials had urged crane for a year to permit them to 
turn off leslies respirator but crane would not because he feared 
his wife could then face murder charges 
tracey jean crane 26 of warren county was convicted in 1988 of 
assault for beating her son repeatedly after his birth on oct 16 
1987 
an autopsy showed leslie died saturday of brain injuries 
suffered in a december 1987 beating said allegheny county coroner 
joshua perper who ruled the death a homicide 
warren county district attorney joseph a massa jr said he 
expected to announce monday whether he will file any new charges 
against mrs crane who is serving a six to 20year prison 
sentence 
the child was 7 weeks old when he was admitted to childrens 
hospital of pittsburgh with a severe brain injury he suffered in a 
beating by mrs crane his leg had been broken and his skull 
fractured in two earlier beatings 
leslie remained in a vegetative state for the rest of his life 
connected to the respirator the baby grew teeth and gained weight 
but showed no other signs of improving 
it was apparent the first hour he was here that he was a 
profoundly injured child and it was unlikely we could make any kind 
of a difference said dr ann thompson director of critical care 
medicine at childrens hospital 
the boy died at 229 am saturday hospital officials declined 
to say when they shut off the respirator 
i became convinced that morally ethically and practically it 
was time to commit leslie to the mercy of god said crane of 
turtle creek his statement was issued by his attorney george c 
entenmann 
childrens hospital president edwin k zechman jr said the 
hospital had planned to ask the court to appoint a new guardian for 
the child 
costs in the hospitals respiratory care unit run about 1000 a 
day hospital spokeswoman lynn mcmahon would not say how the bills 
were being paid 
entenmann would not comment on whether crane had agreed to allow 
the lifesupport removal in exchange for leniency for his wife 
the lawyer said the boys burial arrangements would be private

the germans believe they have a strategy that will merge the two 
economies with minimum shock to the rest of europe but there are 
unknowns 
if the union increases inflation german interest rates may rise

attorney in 1986 about accepting government reimbursement for stays 
in a minneapolis condominium according to documents despite his 
contention this month that he had no reason to doubt the propriety 
of the plan

foreign exchange dealers agree the first trading 
day after the powerful west german mark becomes east germanys 
currency should be calm but what happens next is a matter of 
argument 
july 1 when the merger takes place is a special day of 
course in particular for the history of this country but in 
economic terms the world will not be so different from june 30 
said peter pietsch an economist with commerzbank in frankfurt 
west germany will convert east german marks at the generous 11 
rate for the first 4000 and 21 above that total 
the government is printing 120 billion marks 70 billion for 
the conversion which will increase west germanys money supply by 
10 percent 
recently the mark has been strong in relation to the dollar and 
japanese yen against which it floats freely but weaker within the 
ninecurrency european monetary system which limits its movements 
bulls believe the mark will be pushed higher by germanys 
expected economic expansion and possible increases in interest 
rates to check inflation bears worry about political uncertainty 
and inflation 
robin aspinall director of currency economics at the london 
investment firm hoare govett ltd sees a rise in value to 140 
marks to the dollar from the current 168 and perhaps even to 
parity in three or four years 
you have the perfect conditions for a strong currency he 
said its right out of the textbook of the major currencies i 
would back the deutsche mark against all comers 
pietsch expects an increase to 160 to the dollar within a year 
but no more 
stephen king international economist with the london investment 
firm james capel and co feels the mark will weaken against the 
dollar and yen but rise against other european currencies

attorney general dick thornburgh on sunday 
fired back at critics who say the bush administration is not moving 
aggressively to ferret out savings and loan fraud

republicans or democrats north south east and west and weve 
compiled a very impressive record on that score thornburgh 
said during an appearance on the cbstv program face the nation 
his comments came as treasury secretary nicholas brady said it 
was time for democrats and republicans to stop trying to affix 
blame for the sampl scandal and concentrate on catching culprits 
brady appearing on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
program agreed with members of congress who have said the focus 
should shift from fingerpointing to prosecuting sampl industry 
officials who violated the laws 
what the american people want is a dedicated organized calm 
approach to cleaning up the problem and make sure to 
prosecute the criminals involved brady said 
brady recently revised the bush administrations estimate on the 
cost of the savings and loan bailout to as high as 130 billion 
thornburgh denied that prosecutors have targeted lowerlevel 
employees of failed institutions rather than top officials 
i think the record clearly indicates the contrary youve seen 
executive after executive convicted sentenced to jail he said 
but thornburgh couldnt say how many new indictments have been 
obtained since bush took office in january 1989 
theres a continuum there of activity on the part of the 
department of justice he said we dont keep score by whos 
the president at the time 
members of congress have criticized the slow pace of 
prosecutions in the saving and loans scandal but administration 
officials have said the investigations of financial mismanagement 
and fraud are extremely complicated and will take time to resolve 
thornburgh said sunday that something more important than the 
numbers should be addressed and thats the commitment 
administration officials said last week there were 791 fraud 
convictions in 1989 and 100 million in stolen funds was recovered 
sen pete domenici rnm urged against focusing on which 
political party is more to blame for the savings and loan debacle 
saying thats history we ought to go after the crooks 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said that while a republican administration failed to 
adequately regulate the savings and loan industry congress also 
should bear some of the blame the issue is do we go after those 
involved said panetta 
in recent days members of the bush administration have said the 
democraticcontrolled congress should accept part of the blame for 
the sampl mess 
likewise democrats have been quick to claim that the crisis 
emerged largely because of lax regulation of the savings and loans 
by the republican reagan administration 
brady meanwhile said sunday that the government should dispose 
of real estate holdings acquired as part of the growing savings and 
loan scandal even if it has to offer more favorable discounts 
the government shouldnt be in the real estate business he 
said on the abc program 
as part of the bailout of the ailing savings and loan industry 
the resolution trust corp is selling about 36000 properties 
originally valued at 149 billion often at discount 
most of the properties are in texas although they are scattered 
through 45 states 
brady said sunday that part of the increased cost estimate of 
the sampl cleanup was sagging real estate industry which has affected 
the sale of the distressed properties held by the rtc 
the rtc was created to administer the savings and loan cleanup

japan surpassed the united states to become the 
biggest donor of government aid to the third world in 1989 the 
organization for economic cooperation and development said 
the achievement could soften criticism that japan with its 
immense financial strength has not done its share to help 
developing countries 
japans total aid effort in 1989 was 9 billion compared with 
77 billion for the us the parisbased organization of 
industrial democracies said in a report 
the us figure represented a decline of 27 percent from 1988 
after adjusting for inflation the decline meant that us aid as a 
share of gross national product declined from 021 percent in 1988 
to 015 percent last year the worst performance among the oecds 
main aid donor countries 
joseph wheeler chairman of the oecds development assistance 
committee told a news conference sunday the us aid figure for 
1989 understates the us effort in the same way the 1988 total 
overstated aid disbursements 
if us contributions to multilateral aid institutions were 
spread evenly over the two years instead of bunched more heavily in 
1988 wheeler said the level each year would have been 89 
billion equivalent to 018 percent of gnp in 1988 and 017 percent 
in 1989 
but the oecd said us bilateral aid to the third world has 
fallen steadily in recent years 
wheeler said he expects the us will lift its aid effort to at 
least 9 billion this year he said us contributions to 
multilateral aid institutions should return to normal levels in 
1990 and substantial new aid programs in central america are 
likely 
but this probably wont be enough to enable the us to regain 
its number one slot wheeler said since japan plans to spend at 
least 31 billion on aid over the next three years 
wheeler said government assistance to developing countries from 
all sources in 1989 totalled 513 billion scarecely changed from 
the yearearlier figure of 517 billion the total resource flow 
including private funds and export credits to these countries is 
estimated at 109 billion up 45 percent from 1988 
wheeler said the aid effort of the oecds 18 richest countries 
has increased in real terms at an average rate of 29 percent a 
year or a total of about 33 percent in the past decade 
wheeler said the aid effort of western industrialized nations in 
1989 wasnt affected by assistance to eastern europe most donor 
countries have indicated future aid to eastern europe wont be 
diverted from traditional aid recipients he said 
the oecd said scandinavian countries continued to provide the 
most official aid last year as a percentage of gnp led by norway 
with 102 percent 
the oecds member nations are australia austria belgium 
britain canada denmark finland france greece iceland 
ireland italy japan luxembourg the netherlands new zealand 
norway portugal spain sweden switzerland turkey the united 
states and west germany 
the third biggest donor by dollars after japan and the us 
was france with 514 billion followed by west germany with 495 
billion
