its the battle of the monster roller 
coasters whiteknucklers designed to scare you silly and its 
just in time for youngsters on spring vacation to buy a thrill 
but at 17plus these thrills arent cheap 
thirty miles from downtown los angeles in opposite directions 
the knotts berry farm and six flags magic mountain amusement parks 
are fighting to outdo each other by unleashing multimilliondollar 
fright machines 
knotts to the southeast in buena park promises its new 5 
million boomerang coaster will elicit the primal scream magic 
mountain at valencia to the northwest says its 8 million viper 
coaster provides the most frightening ride on earth 
they are the latest in the nations decadelong competition to 
see who can build the biggest fastest and scariest amusement park 
attraction 
the battle sometimes ends up in court in allentown pa the 
dorney park amusement park recently filed a lawsuit in federal 
court to stop six flags over texas from claiming it has the 
nations tallest wooden roller coaster 
advertisements claim the 55 million texas giant coaster is the 
highest at 143 feet compared with 95 feet for dorneys hercules 
coaster but dorney park insists hercules is 157 feet because it 
drops over a cliff and the texas giant 137 feet 
coaster enthusiasts go all over the country looking for 
moments of negative gravity said paul ruben editor of roller 
coaster magazine he planned to be on hand today when viper opens 
to the public 
viper is a megacoaster that precisely defines the next step in 
roller coaster evolution viper is quite simply the ultimate 
scream machine said magic mountain president joseph schillaci 
viper sends cars racing 70 mph over a course that reaches 188 
feet high and includes seven loops during a 2minute run 
padded overtheshoulder locking harnesses keep passengers 
inside and failsafe air brakes on the track are computer 
controlled to assure proper ride speed 
asked about the safety of boomerang which also has padded 
shoulder harnesses knotts spokesman stuart zanville said 
structural experts employed by the amusement parks examine thrill 
rides daily there are no checks by government agencies although 
the occupational safety and health administration does inspect 
carnival rides 
weve never had a riderelated fatality every ride is 
inspected every single day by our safety inspectors zanville 
said 
magic mountain markets the viper as the worlds tallest looping 
roller coaster the nations tallest roller coaster is the 
205foothigh magnum xl 200 at the cedar point amusement park in 
sandusky ohio but it doesnt loop 
but the president of the 2000member american coaster 
enthusiasts group says pacing steepness and the severity of turns 
are more important factors than size 
you could have a ride 50 feet tall and it could scare the 
beejeebees out of you said randy geisler the chicagobased 
associations leader 
knotts berry farm understandably agrees with geisler 
boomerang pales in size compared to viper 
boomerang cars make the outbound and return trips on the same 
875footlong track riders are first pulled backward to the top of 
a 125foot tower then released to hurtle through three vertical 
loops before ascending another tower for the ride back it lasts 90 
seconds 
during the ride you have the sensation that you actually have 
fallen off the track with ours its not the height or the speed 
its how you feel when you get off said zanville 
there are similar rides at six flags over texas near dallas and 
canadas wonderland theme park in toronto 
roller coaster popularity peaked in the 1920s with more than 
1500 in operation in the united states by 1978 only 147 were 
left in north america 
but there will be 203 coasters in operation by the end of this 
year with 17 new moved or renovated ones opening

the house of balmain has presented its new designer 
for its ivoire line of luxury readytowear alistair blair of 
scotland 
he is wellknown in great britain having designed for jaeger 
and under his own label 
his sketches won me over said alain chevalier who as 
balmains resident has overseen a major financial restructuring 
this year 
chevalier said he based his choice announced friday on blairs 
creativity and experience which includes nine years in paris with 
couture houses like dior givenchy chloe and karl lagerfeld 
this is the latest in various french fashion companies bids to 
boost fashion excitement and sales with new designers 
the trend started in 1983 when karl lagerfeld made a splash at 
chanel reviving the old name with his creative ideas 
last summer gianfranco ferre took over as diors head designer 
the house of lanvin is looking for original couture creativity from 
claude montana 
and nina riccis readytowear got a fresh approach with another 
englishman philip waghorne 
erik mortensen balmains danishborn designer will keep his 
post as head of haute couture which he has occupied since pierre 
balmains death in 1982 
his last ivoire collection wednesday was a lowkeyed 
presentation of a few beautifully made outfits 
among the suits a standout was the black faille number with hot 
orange satin lapels turned back with a big button 
in the sparkly evening wear the hostess gown of gold guipure 
lace over a spangled stripe skirt had charm worthy of the new new 
york preference for taste over glitz 
there also were remarkable black knits pieced in swooping arcs 
buttoned up with gold and sporting tulipsplit skirts 
now fashion buffs will be watching for blairs october debut 
ive given up my own label in england said blair a 
francophile who grew up near glasgow and trained at st martins 
school of art 
i feel paris is indeed the fashion capital the place to be 
for any designer he said 
he wouldnt reveal his plans but his recent work shows a 
bright bouncy approach without being too wayout for a couture 
customer 
blair will move to paris for his new job but will continue to 
design for jaeger and ballantyne cashmeres 
his first balmain assignment is a trip to the united states next 
week to win american prestigestore buyers as yet balmain has 
little representation in us shops 
chevalier also announced plans for luxury readytowear 
expansion in the far east with stores coming up soon in hong kong 
bangkok and singapore 
the balmain label still has a classic image but no matter what 
creations blair comes up with the prices will remain in the 
mediumexpensive category about 1000 for a suit retail 
chevalier also announced there would be a less expensive 
subivoire line based on blairs creations as yet unnamed most 
big names exploit less expensive lines such as saint laurents 
variation it is about a third less than the regular luxury 
readytowear

from third world countries have arrived in italy each year 
officials say estimates of the total number of illegal immigrants 
vary from 500000 to 15 million 
italy has had difficulty absorbing the arrivals because of job 
and housing shortages as well as inadequate public health and 
education services 
there has been a recent wave of violence against immigrants 
particularly in the popular tourist city of florence

wall street is still waiting for assurance that 
the ual corps 438 billion buyout will go through but the 
companys employees say theyre willing to accept the tough 
concessions that are part of the deal 
the unions making the purchase have neither financing 
commitments nor a new management team and some investors and 
analysts say they wont take the new deal seriously until those 
issues are nailed down 
the question is who is going to manage this thing and take it 
to the banks said analyst jack hunter of howe barnes investments 
inc in chicago 
hunter said he believed the deal ultimately would go through 
but another airlines analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the deals chances were 5050 at best 
directors of ual the parent of united airlines announced an 
agreement in principle friday to sell the nations secondlargest 
carrier to its 71000 employees for cash and securities equal to 
201 a share which would create the countrys largest workerowned 
company 
the stock market reflected investor skepticism the deal will be 
done after a strong opening ual closed 2 lower at 16350 on the 
new york stock exchange 
the possibility the unions will dump ual chairman and chief 
executive stephen wolf was seen by some observers as the biggest 
threat to a successful conclusion of the deal 
wolf is perceived as a capable airline manager despite his 
abrasive relations with the unions 
frederick dubinsky chairman of the united chapter of the air 
line pilots association told a news conference in new york that 
wolf would be replaced 
its our intention to put together a topnotch senior 
management team and that will include a new ceo he said 
but later in the day union group spokesman hank krakowski said 
the group had made no such decision 
our position is were not including or precluding anyone from 
any management team at this point krakowski said 
the union group includes uniteds pilots machinists and flight 
attendants unions which together represent about twothirds of 
uals employees 
ual will spin off to shareholders its entire 50 percent stake in 
covia which is coowned by a consortium of five other airlines and 
operates an automated reservations system called apollo 
the agreement calls for employees to give up 2 billion in 
concessions over five years 
the unions would sign fiveyear contracts with nostrike 
clauses other concessions include wage cuts of up to 769 percent 
for flight attendants and machinists and up to 11 percent for 
pilots 
uals 25700 nonunion employees will negotiate their work 
conditions with the union group said their lawyer stephen fraidin 
under the agreement the pilots would own 379 percent of ual 
machinists would own 357 percent nonunion employees about 143 
percent and flight attendants about 12 percent the unions said 
the largest employeeowned company currently is publix inc a 
supermarket chain based in lakeland fla with 50000 employees 
said corey rosen executive director of the national center for 
employee ownership in oakland calif 
some ual corp employees said they were prepared to accept the 
concessions that go along with the agreement 
frederick dubinsky head of uniteds pilot union referred to 
the concessions as sweat equity and said there is no other 
decent alternative 
i would be willing to give up money myself said donna a 
flight attendant interviewed at ohare international airport who 
would not give her full name ten percent would be too much 5 
percent would hurt but i would be willing to take it 
we would never say no to job concessions said another 
flight attendant from denver but you have to look at the whole 
benefits package not just wages she said 
a 25year united pilot from washington dc said wage cuts 
should not go beyond about 10 percent but added paywise we 
will do everything we can to save the airline

a moderate earthquake jolted the san 
francisco bay area on friday night causing minor damage and 
jarring nerves during a baseball game that recalled the world 
series contest stopped by last years kller quake 
the quake which struck at 739 pm pdt registered 45 on the 
richter scale according to a preliminary reading from the state 
office of emergency services that is considered strong enough to 
cause moderate damage in the immediate area 
one of an afternoonlong series of tremors it was centered near 
danville about 20 miles southeast of san francisco and inland from 
san francisco bay 
at candlestick park where an exhibition ballgame between the 
san francisco giants and oakland athletics had just gotten 
underway players and spectators seemed to momentarily stunned 
everybody sort of sat up and said no that didnt happen 
did someone jump hard said bob egelko an associated press 
reporter who was covering the game it looked like the players 
hesitated 
the tremors were an eerie reminder of the devastating 
71magnitude quake that struck northern california on oct 17 
minutes before the start of the third game of the world series 
between the giants and the as at candlestick that quake killed 67 
people and did millions of dollars in property damage 
though the quake was felt over a wide area there werent any 
immediate reports of serious damage said chuck young of the office 
of emergency services 
we queried all of the affected counties and they said the only 
real problem has been a slow dial tone on the phone young said 
the 45magnitude quake was followed at 751 pm with a tremor 
of magnitude 35 young said 
several temblors centered in the danville area shook san 
francisco and its eastern suburbs through the afternoon the 
biggest of magnitude 39 at 341 pm and of magnitude 35 at 155 
pm those were preliminary measurements by the us geological 
survey in menlo park 
the afternoon quakes knocked objects from market shelves in 
several communities and startled some shoppers into running from 
the stores 
it was like the first one a sharp fast jolt and i felt a 
real tiny one after said sue nicoles administrative clerk at 
heather farms community center in walnut creek said of the largest 
temblor 
i jumped right out of my chair but it didnt last long enough 
for me to get under my desk which would have been my next move 
she said 
an apparently unrelated quake of magnitude 41 shook a sparsely 
populated stretch of desert 450 miles to the southeast near indio 
at 607 pm friday said scientists at the california institute of 
technology in pasadena authorities said there were no immediate 
reports of damage or injuries 
tracy hein of the contra costa county office of emergency 
services in danville described the afternoon temblor as a little 
joy ride ill tell you it was more like a truck hitting the 
building 
customers at the lucky supermarket in walnut creek ran out when 
cans and boxes tumbled from the shelves said store manager gary 
earl there wasnt any serious damage he said 
bay area rapid transit trains which connect san francisco with 
the suburbs across the bay were halted for about five minutes as a 
precaution during the afternoon quake said transit district 
spokesman sy mouber 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an 
earthquake every increase of one number means the ground motion is 
10 times greater 
a quake of the magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by 
humans a quake of 35 can cause slight damage in the local area 4 
moderate damage 5 considerable damage 6 severe damage a 7 
reading is a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy 
damage 8 is a great quake capable of tremendous damage

a new redoubt eruption confirmed the 
pattern that geologists have observed in the seismic activity 
around the volcano over the past four months 
increasing tremors at the volcanos base heralded a moderate 
blast friday from the 10197foot volcano about 110 miles southwest 
of anchorage said geologist michael doukas 
the same earthquake pattern preceded moderate eruptions on march 
23 and march 29 
the latest eruption at 523 pm adt 923 pm edt sent ash 
30000 feet into the sky it lasted eight minutes according to a 
seismometer on mount spur about 30 miles north of redoubt 
previous eruptions have disrupted flights because the ash can 
ruin airplane engines but the ash from fridays blast was split by 
wind sheer and drifted in two directions doukas said

you dont have to celebrate passover to love 
my first jewish cooking video says mother wonderful creator 
of the cooking instructions blended with nostalgia tradition and 
commentary 
and what gives any family more pleasure than sitting down 
together to share a delicious sabbath dinner says mother 
wonderful whose real name is myra chanin as she introduces the 
75minute procession of cooks with their favorite secret recipes 
and as the old ads for rye bread said you dont have to be 
jewish to enjoy it 
the video gives nonjewish people a feeling of that connection 
between food and love this is the food and the tradition that 
produced a generation of doctors lawyers and cpas mrs chanin 
said 
actually the video came out months ago but mrs chanin held 
off publicizing it too much at first 
i wanted to make sure jewish people liked it she said i 
didnt want them all hating the video when i went out promoting it 
those little old ladies theyre worse than muggers 
every recipe is kosher for passover except the challah a 
braided leavened bread 
the video offers recipes for gefilte fish horseradish chicken 
soup matzoh balls latke baked chicken and vegetable kugel for 
dessert there are tasty meringue and raspberry sorbet 
the video crew took no chances about making a slip that would 
violate jewish dietary laws mrs chanin said 
we had a kosher maven there for all the taping she said 
anyone kosher who wants to use it they can 
mrs chanin thinks the traditional meals are making a comeback 
the reason people are very taken with the old foods is they 
really miss the sense of community that existed with them there 
was tremendous feeling in those dinners love competition all 
those things 
mrs chanin whos quick with oneliners said she didnt really 
learn to cook until she left home and decided good cooking was part 
of the way to win a husband 
we all say the way to a mans heart is through his stomach 
because we know its not through his brains she said yes the 
way to a mans heart is through his stomach or somewhere around 
there 
her own mother did wonderful things with food mrs chanin said 
i still find that the dishes i cook today that really knock 
people out are her recipes she said 
mrs chanin immortalized her mother with a lighthearted book 
jewish penicillin or mother wonderfuls profusely illustrated 
guide to the proper preparation of chicken soup 
it shows her mother matching wits with a butcher persuading him 
to give her some extra feet for her soup pot to help the flavor 
cleaning and rerinsing everything 
my mother always wanted me to write something like war and 
peace mrs chanin said im sure she never expected to be 
immortalized by a book that showed her holding a dead chicken by 
its feet

three leaders of the crow indian tribe 
were convicted of fraudulently convincing two banks to approve 
loans that one of the leaders has not repaid a fourth defendant 
was acquitted 
a us district court jury friday convicted tribal chairman 
richard real bird theodore hogan and willie stewart jr on charges 
of conspiracy bank fraud and lying on a loan application robert 
s howe was acquitted of the same charges 
us district judge david ezra let the three tribal leaders 
remain free on bond until sentencing july 17 each faces up to 12 
years in prison and fines up to 25000 
the charges were part of a grand jury indictment that named 26 
tribal leaders on a total of 37 counts thirteen more trials 
about half of which probably will include real bird are scheduled 
throughout the summer 
assistant us attorney carl rostad had charged that the 
defendants misled the little horn state bank in hardin and first 
citizens bank in billings into approving loans in 1986 for hogan 
who was deeply in debt 
rostad said the defendants told the banks the tribe would pay 
hogan 296500 for land they knew already had been foreclosed on 
the banks have not been paid rostad said and hogans land 
which is near the custer battlefield national monument in 
southeastern montana eventually was sold to a nontribal member 
real bird testified that the bureau of indian affiars is holding 
38 million in coal taxes for the tribe he said the defendants 
acting on the approval of a bia employee believed that money would 
be available to pay hogan who then could repay the loans 
weve said the defendants wrongs were not affected by 
whatever the bia did or didnt do rostad said apparently the 
jury thought so as well 
but real birds lawyer rodney shepherd said this as much of 
a travesty as when the white man took everything from these people 
except their pride 
now i guess theyre trying to take that too

commissioner fred t goldberg jr says the 
internal revenue service is firmly committed to safeguarding 
taxpayers rights but critics say the word has not filtered down 
to some agents in the field 
david keating executive vice president of the national 
taxpayers union told a senate finance subcommittee friday that the 
situation could get worse as budget shortages increase pressure on 
the irs to boost collections 
as marching orders filter through the bureaucracy each 
management layer tends to rewrite the orders stronger to ensure 
that the field troops fully understand the new mission keating 
said 
the result may well be that irs employees could take a much 
tougher stand with taxpayers causing more violations of the 
taxpayer bill of rights 
goldberg testifying at a hearing on how the taxpayer protection 
law is being implemented acknowledged that his agencys 120000 
employees make mistakes but overall he said the new law is 
working we are indeed making a great deal of progress 
whether a taxpayer is due a refund owes the government taxes 
is being audited or is asking us a question that individual 
deserves to be treated fairly and with respect goldberg said 
that is the fundamental right taxpayers should expect and they 
should receive nothing less 
the taxpayer bill of rights was enacted in 1988 in response to 
complaints about the behavior of some irs employees and what 
congress viewed as a tendency to intimidate citizens 
the law for example requires the irs to spell out clearly any 
demand for taxes due prohibits the agency from rewarding employees 
on the basis of how much tax they collect and makes it more 
difficult for the irs to seize a persons property for nonpayment 
of taxes 
kay m council of high point nc told the subcommittee that 
after a long battle with the irs her husband killed himself so she 
could use his 250000 insurance policy to continue the fight 
alex is dead because of the irss arrogance and incompetence 
she contended 
the councils problem grew out of a 70000 taxshelter 
deduction they claimed on their 1979 tax return and which the irs 
rejected after alex councils death in 1988 a federal court ruled 
that the couple owed no back taxes because the irss notice of 
deficiency had been sent four months after the statute of 
limitations had expired 
keating of the national taxpayers union said it is unlikely 
that the bill of rights would have helped the councils although 
the legislation allows a taxpayer to sue for damages if the irs 
acts recklessly or intentionally breaks a law it does not permit a 
suit for careless actions 
was the irs treatment of the council family careless and 
negligent absolutely keating said was it reckless or 
intentional it might have been but that is a very difficult 
standard to prove 
the us chamber of commerce said the new law appears to have 
had a major positive impact on the relationship between taxpayers 
and the irs 
while we get plenty of telephone calls complaining about 
compliance burdens complexity and substantive tax provisions 
telephone calls from chamber smallbusiness members facing 
immediate and unwarranted levy on seizing their house or business 
or similar serious problems have declined noticeably said david 
r burton manager of the chambers tax policy center 
sen david pryor dark chairman of the subcommittee and chief 
author of the taxpayer bill of rights said the recent complaint of 
an arkansas businessman probably sums up how most americans view 
the irs 
its not that i have a problem with paying the irs every shiny 
nickel i owe the government and its not that i begrudge them 
getting tough with me if i dont pay the businessman said 
what i resent is when they bury me in computer letters dont 
even acknowledge my explanations then grab my bank account and 
ruin my credit and only then decide they were wrong after all

president bush says he will sign an executive 
order that he earlier promised and in fact claimed to have issued 
protecting chinese students from deportation 
aides said bush will release the order probably early next 
week incorporating provisions of an informal directive he had 
issued on dealing with chinese who feared for their safety if sent 
home when their visas expired many had supported the 
nowsuppressed democracy movement 
the president said his order also will extend the deferral of 
enforced departure for chinese nationals which is currently 
scheduled to expire on june 5 of this year through jan 1 1994 
reacting to criticism that he has failed to issue the executive 
order he promised last year bush said friday i did say i was 
going to have an executive order what we had was an executive 
directive from the president that had precisely the same legal 
effect as an executive order 
the president had promised the executive order when he vetoed 
congressional legislation nov 30 that was designed to protect the 
students from deportation 
he viewed the legislation as an infringement on presidential 
powers but pledged at the time that in the face of harsh 
reprisals by the beijing government against democracy advocates no 
chinese student would be forced to go home against his or her will 
the president has since said that he issued an executive order 
but instead it was a directive and to allay any concerns 
bush said friday he will now put it in the form of an executive 
order 
we dont want to take a chance on people being mistreated 
brutalized he said in a questionandanswer session to the 
american society of newspaper editors that also focused on his 
upcoming summit with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
on another topic bush said he will soon announce a policy 
banning offshore oil drilling in some environmentally sensitive 
areas and redefining sea lanes for tankers in others such as the 
florida everglades 
the president last year ordered a task force to study offshore 
drilling with an eye to environmental protection he has yet to 
announce the findings of the study or any policy moves 
bush a former texas oilman said he opposes a permanent ban on 
offshore drilling because then i would be compelled to ask the 
question where do we get the energy to keep this country going i 
dont think there should be a ban 
however he added there will definitely be bans on certain 
environmentally sensitive areas 
touching on other matters bush said 
he knew nothing about the meeting between former president 
carter and palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat 
this week he said carter was not acting with the blessing of 
nor disapproval of or anything else of the administration but 
certainly a former president should be free to do his thing 
he is not linking aid to israel to us hopes that israel works 
out a negotiating format for peace with palestinians 
he hoped a compromise budget plan could be drafted to reduce 
the huge federal deficit but he noted that one congressional 
deadline had already been missed and another was fast approaching

a ceremony for the surrender of 
10000 afghan guerrillas turned into a surprise attack in which 
rebels shot to death at least two afghan generals according to 
news reports and sources 
rebel sources said fridays attack near the western afghan city 
of herat was planned five months ago it apparently was in revenge 
for a similar deadly trick by government forces 11 years ago 
the exact number of casualties was not known 
western diplomats in pakistan said on condition of anonymity 
they had reports that up to five afghan generals were killed or 
wounded in the 15minute gun battle and in handtohand combat with 
knives and pistols they also said civilians including children 
died in the fighting on the plains outside herat about 400 miles 
west of the afghan capital of kabul 
governmentrun radio kabul said numerous people were killed 
including lt gen jalal razaminda a second unidentified general 
civilians and nine guerrillas 
the guerrillas had said they would give up their weapons and 
support the national reconcilation policy of sovietbacked 
president najib 
the government uses the term national reconcilation to 
signify agreement by local guerrilla groups to switch sides and 
either stop fighting or help the marxist government in the war it 
has fought with rebels since seizing power in a 1978 coup 
the government says tens of thousands of rebels have laid down 
their weapons in the past year 
but this time said the jamaitiislami guerrilla organization 
it was all a trick to trap government forces 
jamiatiislami is considered the most militarily efficient of 
the seven afghan guerrilla groups and the dominant one in the herat 
area 
the rebels are supported by the united states and saudi arabia 
and operate from bases in pakistan they call themselves 
mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
rebel sources in the southeastern pakistani town of quetta who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said rebels slowly began 
infiltrating the herat area in november and recently notified the 
government that they wanted to give up the fight 
according to radio kabul 2200 armed guerrillas and 8000 
unarmed rebels gathered on the plains about 25 miles from herat for 
the surrender ceremony 
but the guerrillas with weapons ranging from side arms to 
recoilless cannons missiles and rocket launchers fired at 
government officials and soldiers instead of laying down their arms 
western diplomats and rebel laders said the guerrillas fired the 
first shot when the provincial governor fazle haq khaliq yaar 
embraced an unidentified guerrilla commander dressed in a white 
robe and turban 
they said the governors guards immediately returned fire and 
the ceremony became a pitched battle with huge exchanges of 
gunfire 
the diplomats said several civilians including children were 
killed in the crossfire which stopped when two afghan army tanks 
moved in with bursts of fire 
kabul radios version of the fighting was a small group of 
extremists attacked the welcoming ceremony with heavy fire in the 
resulting battle between afghan troops and extremists numerous 
people were martyred 
an afghan national tv photographer was reported shot in the head 
and badly wounded 
herat was the first region in afghanistan to rise against the 
soviet union in early 1979 before the red army stepped in to 
bolster the marxist government 
at least 2000 afghans were reported to have died when 
government forces pretended to join the insurrection against 
growing soviet influence and killed protesters 
the soviet union withdrew its troops in february 1989 but still 
sends huge quantities of supplies and weapons to the kabul 
government

president bush is praising japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu for exhibiting political courage in 
championing a major trade agreement but warning that the true test 
will come in implementation of the pact 
bush lauded kaifu for the success he achieved in the month since 
the two leaders met in california to discuss trade tensions arising 
from this countrys huge 49 billion deficit with japan 
for the first time japan has committed to removing a broad 
array of structural barriers that constrain trade and impede 
imports bush said in an appearance friday before the american 
society of newspaper editors 
but he said actual results would be what counted 
neither the japanese consumer nor the american people will be 
convinced that progress is at hand until they see concrete 
results bush said 
after four days of marathon negotiations the united states and 
japan reached agreement late thursday on a set of proposals aimed 
at correcting broadbased structural barriers to trade in both 
countries 
japan promised to take a series of steps to make it easier for 
americans and other foreigners to do business in japan us 
negotiators pledged to boost americas ability to compete 
internationally by improving the education system increasing 
savings and reducing the federal budget deficit 
but us trade specialists expressed doubts friday over how far 
the japanese will go in implementing the accord especially in 
light of strong political resistance to some of the measures in 
tokyo 
a major japanese retailers group vowed to fight a key provision 
of the pact designed to relax restrictions on establishment of 
large retail stores in the country 
clyde v prestowitz jr who was a top trade negotiator in the 
reagan administration said the latest agreement bore many 
similarities to other accords dating back to 1984 and earlier that 
had failed to open japans markets 
these talks are always presented as a final solution to the 
problem he said we keep claiming victory victory and nothing 
much happens 
in a sign that kaifu faces major political obstacles in 
implementing the agreement japans federation of specialty stores 
associations charged that a key provision relaxing restrictions on 
opening large stores would hurt small shop owners 
the 50000member association of small retailers vowed to do 
our best to prevent the decisions from being enforced 
us negotiators viewed shortening of the time for opening large 
stores as a major victory because it would open the way for large 
american and other foreign retailers to set up operations one of 
the beneficiaries is expected to be the toys r us chain 
us trade representative carla hills said she believed the 
pessimists predicting failure for the new trade accord would be 
proven wrong because of a new climate of public opinion in japan 
she cited polls that found japanese consumers upset by high prices 
and lack of competition 
mrs hills said the administration intends to keep lobbying for 
results as negotiators work to prepare a final report on structural 
trade barriers that is due in july 
even after that time she said the administration will keep 
monitoring progress to make sure that the commitments made by japan 
are being met 
this is a good first step it constitutes a clear blueprint of 
reform that will facilitate market opening mrs hills said at a 
news briefing obviously we want results and if they dont 
occur we would be disappointed 
she refused to speculate about whether the administration will 
target japan as an unfair trader in a second round of negotiations 
the administration must decide on that issue by april 30 
many in congress viewed the increased willingness of japan to 
negotiate agreements as an attempt to escape being targeted again 
but sen john danforth rmo urged bush in a letter to once again 
target japan in order to keep up the pressure 
i believe strongly that a failure to designate japan will 
seriously jeopardize the credibility of us trade policy

its known by nasa as the phantom 
head a human skull filled with sensors to measure the dose of 
space radiation that astronauts receive 
the skull goes into space aboard the shuttle discovery for the 
third and probably last time tuesday its keeper in orbit 
astronaut kathryn sullivan hopes the trip will put an end to all 
jokes about the phantom passenger 
its not a passenger its a device actually a very 
sophisticated one and one that has considerable potential to 
provide some very significant data to all of the people within nasa 
who are trying to measure crew health she said 
the head is crammed with instruments that bring its weight to 
more than 20 pounds and covered with a black plastic material 
simulating human skin it contains as many as 600 tiny measuring 
devices called dosimeters 
as in the two previous missions the skull will be mounted to a 
wall in the shuttle middeck near the lower end of an astronaut 
sleeping bag it will be kept in a fireretardant bag 
its not like its hooked there staring at people said nasa 
spokesman brian welch 
the skull will help scientists determine how much radiation 
penetrates the astronauts heads when they are in space such data 
may be crucial for planning extended space station missions and 
lengthy stays on the moon and mars 
it would be medically irresponsible to commit crews to some of 
the highflown ideas we have without understanding their safety 
sullivan said the skull is one of 11 devices inside discovery that 
will monitor various kinds of radiation in space 
although the radiationmonitoring devices do not rival the 
sophisticiation of discoverys primary payload the 15 billion 
hubble space telescope they are equally important to the national 
aeronautics and space administration said gautam badhwar the 
johnson space center physicist in charge of the experiment 
hubble has a very fundamental importance in terms of astronomy 
and how we understand the solar system and the universe around us 
whereas the radiation experiments are much more local he said 
they are designed for the safety of the astronauts for both today 
and for future flights 
the skull first went into space on a defense department flight 
in august but its existence was not acknowleged until after a 
second secret military mission that of the atlantis ended march 4 
the space agency plans to send an entire human torso into space 
but not until the current data is analyzed further badhwar said 
data collected from the atlantis mission still is being studied 
badhwar said but results from the skulls first venture into space 
indicate there is twice as much neutron radiation in an orbiting 
shuttle than nasa had expected at high energy levels 
the extra radiation poses no danger to astronauts badhwar said 
welch said nasa decided to send the skull or dso469 as its 
formally known on discoverys fiveday flight because the shuttle 
will ascend to 380 miles the highest a shuttle has ever gone

the united states and the soviet union head 
for a superpower summit in seven weeks still divided on major 
nuclear arms control issues but hoping that more talks next month 
will produce the hard decisions needed to weld agreement 
secretary of state james a baker iii did use three days of 
meetings with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze this 
week to deliver repeated warnings of the consequences of employing 
moscows military weight to crush lithuanias fervor for 
independence 
and both nations took a new look at how a unified germany will 
fit into the european community making no effort to disguise 
fundamental differences on how that fit eventually will be made 
baker and shevardnadze acted to lower expectations that 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev actually 
will be able to sign a treaty sharply reducing intercontinental 
nuclear weapons when they meet here beginning may 30 
but the two did hold out hope that all or most major issues may 
be resolved by then leaving the actual signing of a treaty to 
await a celebration summit later in the year 
baker speaking to reporters before a backdrop of 14 american 
and soviet flags said he and shevardnadze failed to resolve 
differences over airlaunched and sealaunched cruise missiles two 
obstacles for agreement on a strategic arms reduction treaty 
that is a disappointment he said 
shevardnadze holding a separate news conference in the same 
state department auditorium said i would not hide from you the 
fact that we have encountered certain difficulties certain 
problems in concluding a strategic arms treaty 
this is a time of hard choices the hard choices that one has 
to make in the concluding stages of the talks the foreign 
minister said 
he said the problem is compounded by the need to write a treaty 
that will be ratified by the newly independent soviet parliament 
acting in much the same way as the us senate considers 
international accords 
but shevardnadze predicted in the end there will be real 
certainty that we will have a solid agreement a durable 
agreement 
baker and shevardnadze will hold another round of talks in the 
soviet union on may 1619 to try to settle the nuclearweapons 
issues 
its still our hope that major issues will be resolved by the 
summit but thats got to take a lot of work baker said 
he also said divisions remain on key elements of an agreement to 
reduce conventional nonnuclear military forces in europe 
especially on how to deal with aircraft 
bush met with shevardnadze for about two hours and joined baker 
in warning that crushing the independence drive in lithuania would 
chill superpower relations 
i dont think we are telling them what to do were telling 
them what not to do and that is dont use force the president 
told the american society of newspaper editors later 
baker said he raised the issue of lithuania with shevardnadze on 
each of the three days delivering very serious and candid 
warnings 
but he said there does seem to be hope for a peaceful resolution 
in shevardnadzes repeated commitment to peaceful dialogue and both 
sides apparent interest in some sort of referendum on the issue 
baker also said the furor may be dampened by the decision of 
lithuanian leaders to draw back from a headlong rush to 
independence by indicating that a more gradual stepbystep process 
might be acceptable 
shevardnadze said we have a clear conscience on lithuania 
and that he does not believe the controversy should damage 
ussoviet relations 
baker said moscow had dropped its insistence that a reunified 
germany be neutral recognizing that is perhaps not the best 
route to go 
but both he and shevardnadze made clear that sharp disagreement 
remains over us insistence that a unified german nation retain 
west germanys membership in the north atlantic treaty organization 
we have to look for a solution a solution that would be 
acceptable to both nato and the warsaw pact shevardnadze said 
he did not offer any specifics beyond a suggestion that perhaps 
the merged country could be part both of nato and the warsaw pact 
baker displayed no enthusiasm for the idea

states are getting poorer forcing governors 
to respond with budget cuts a freeze on new programs and calls for 
higher taxes a survey says 
twenty states have either proposed or already cut spending in 
budgets previously enacted compared with eight this time a year 
ago the study by two associations said friday 
the report blamed worsening state finances on increased spending 
for medicaid education prisons and transportation problems it 
traced in part to federal requirements or spending cutbacks 
the fiscal survey of the states is taken twice yearly by the 
national governors association and the national association of 
state budget officers 
the financial outlook for states has become so bleak the report 
said that governors are even willing to propose taxes in an 
election year 
large tax proposals are not commonly enacted in years 
corresponding with gubernatorial elections the report said 
fiscal 1991 is such a year thirtysix governors races will be 
decided in november 1990 
while 21 governors have proposed tax increases new jersey and 
new york would account for more than 50 percent of the 49 billion 
raised if the new revenues were enacted the survey found 
most governors have proposed 1991 spending increases of 5 
percent to 10 percent the report said 
this range of increases suggests that states will be 
continuing current programs but not adding new initiatives said 
gerald h miller executive director of the national association of 
state budget officers 
total state yearend balances which registered a record high of 
126 billion last year are projected to drop to 83 billion by 
the end of 1990 the survey found 
the study said the most significant personal income tax 
proposals were made in kentucky new york and oklahoma 
eight states have proposed sales tax increases with new jersey 
seeking to raise more than 1 billion by boosting the rate from 6 
percent to 7 percent and by removing some exemptions rate boosts 
also are under consideration in new mexico and oklahoma 
five states have asked for business tax increases with the 
largest hike proposed in new york 
nine states want cigarette tax increases led by floridas plan 
to raise 259 million in new revenue 
four states want higher motor fuel taxes with ohio and 
washington proposing the largest increases four states seek to 
increase taxes on alcohol

eastern airlines has government permission to 
sell its key international routes to american airlines under a plan 
that eastern officials say is key to the future of the troubled 
carrier 
the transportation department on friday tentatively approved the 
transfer of easterns south and central american routes along with 
a miamimadrid route to american it also approved sale of a 
continental airlines miamilondon route to american as part of the 
same package 
eastern and continental both are owned by texas air corp 
but the department stalled a proposal to turn over easterns 
only remaining canadian route from miami and tampa fla to 
toronto it said further study would determine whether that could 
go to american or another carrier 
the 349 million sale is central to easterns plans to rebuild 
under the direction of a bankruptcy court from the effects of a 
yearold machinists union strike us bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland last month approved the proposed sale of easterns latin 
american routes and related assets 
the transportation department approval is temporary and would 
not become final until after a 10day period to allow for 
objections to the deal and responses from the airlines 
while the government awards routes to carriers on the basis of 
public interest and must approve all transfers of service it 
allows the airlines to treat their routes as assets that can be 
bought and sold 
in approving the joint application by eastern continental and 
american the department said the transfer was in the public 
interest and did not conflict with important international 
aviation policy objectives 
it noted that the carriers maintained that the transfer of the 
routes was essential to the viability of eastern and that 
americans acquisition would continue the service 
the order also said the government determined that the transfer 
would not reduce competition and indeed will in many respects 
improve it

a cable telecast of a documentary about an 
international child custody battle went on as scheduled only 
minutes after a federal appeals court overturned a ban on the 
broadcast 
a threejudge panel of the us court of appeals on friday night 
vacated an order that dr eric foretich had obtained hours earlier 
in us district court barring broadcast of hilary in hiding a 
british broadcasting corp documentary about his 7yearold 
daughter hilary 
the program was aired friday night on the lifetime cable 
network whose executives had appealed the ruling of district judge 
stanley sporkin 
the documentary chronicled the girls odyssey with her maternal 
grandparents that took her from northern virginia to england to new 
zealand during her fathers attempts to have unsupervised visits 
with her 
foretichs lawyer elaine mittleman argued that the program 
contained a segment that included footage of the girl during 
therapy sessions she said that showing the scenes would have 
violated the childs constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy 
the girls mother dr elizabeth morgan sent the child into 
hiding 
after a district of columbia superior court judge ordered her to 
allow foretich unsupervised visits with the girl 
morgan claimed that her former husband had sexually assaulted 
the child a charge that foretich denies morgan spent almost two 
years in jail for contempt

the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
says it is investigating the two dozen shootings that have occurred 
in the fiveweekold greyhound strike 
we believe the public safety is at stake in the random 
shootings directed toward passengeroccupied greyhound buses the 
potential for disaster is considerable stephen higgins the 
bureaus director said friday 
the agency also will conduct an arson investigation into a fire 
at a greyhound garage in boston wednesday night that caused 
250000 in damage higgins said 
the agency has no involvement nor interest in the strike he 
said 
special agents in each of the bureaus 22 district offices will 
serve as coordinators with the bus company on the 
investigations in a statement higgins urged anyone with 
information to call the companys hotline for reporting suspects 
nick nichols a spokesman for the amalgamated council of 
greyhound local unions said the union welcomed the governments 
involvement 
richard cook head of the bureaus firearms division said 
agents had been working with greyhound officials on the shootings 
but had not gotten involved at the companys request 
were investigating it because its a violation of the gun 
control act we would be investigating it if there werent a strike 
and independent of anything greyhound asked for cook said 
fbi agents are involved only on a limited basis in some cases 
said spokesman mike kortan 
also friday union president jim la sala wrote greyhounds board

the air force waited months before notifying 
defense secretary dick cheney that one of two f117a stealth jet 
fighterbombers used in the panama invasion dropped a bomb way 
off target his spokesman says 
meanwhile cheney repeatedly touted the pinpoint accuracy of 
the futuristic f117a planes despite the incident during the dec 
20 attack 
cheneys spokesman pete williams also was kept ignorant of the 
error until after he disclosed new information about the 
longclassified aircraft at a pentagon press briefing tuesday 
in the days following the us invasion pentagon officials said 
the hightech planes were used for the first time in combat 
dropping 2000pound bombs near a panamanian defense forces 
barracks in order to stun and confuse the troops as us 
paratroopers landed in a nearby airfield 
but williams confirmed friday that one of the planes actually 
dropped its bomb some distance away due to an apparent pilot error 
the pilots were told to drop their bombs no closer than 50 
meters from two separate pdf barracks buildings williams said 
but due to a lastminute misunderstanding between the pilots the 
second f117a dropped its bomb on a hillside some distance away 
williams said 
the first bomb hit 55 meters from one of the barracks but the 
second bomb was way off target williams said 
williams also acknowledged that despite weeks of preparation for 
his f117a briefing on tuesday in which he disclosed 
longclassified details about the radarevading fighterbomber 
i didnt know about the bombing mistake 
it was news to us williams said on friday about the 
disclosure in the new york times and the trade publication 
aerospace daily that one of the f117as had missed its intended 
target by over 300 yards 
williams said neither he nor cheney knew about the pilots 
error until after they were questioned about an offtarget bomb 
crater by new york times correspondent michael gordon who had a 
photograph of it 
asked when the air force informed him and cheney williams said 
they were not told about the mistake until tuesday afternoon after 
the f117a briefing took place 
we all know now we all found out about the same time he 
said 
air force spokeswoman capt susan strednansky explained the 
lapse by saying that there was apparently some confusion 
regarding the exact impact of the bomb coming up the chain of 
command 
she said air force officials were looking into the matter to try 
to explain the confusion she said there was no attempt by air 
force military or civilian leaders to keep anything from cheney 
williams said it now appears that the problem centered on a 
misunderstanding between the lead pilot in the twoaircraft bombing 
formation and the second pilot known as the wingman 
as the planes closed in the on barracks the lead pilot was 
supposed to drop a bomb on a field near a barracks on the left 
while the wingman was supposed to drop a bomb on a field near a 
barracks located to the right of it because of a change in wind 
direction however the lead pilot told his wingman to exchange 
targets with him williams said 
however the lead pilot didnt do as he said he would and for 
some unexplained reason dropped his bomb on his original target 
the wingman then adjusted his target even further to the left 
believing that the lead pilot had followed the changed plans 
but that meant the wingman hit a hillside some distance away 
instead of his original target located to the right of the target 
hit by the lead pilot williams said

last years exxon valdez oil spill is 
unlikely to cause longterm harm to fish and other organisms in 
prince william sound exxon corp said in a report 
toxins from the nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled 
in march 1989 were in proportions low enough not to threaten fish 
plankton and sea mammals according to the report friday 
the tainting problem is just not there its good news to the 
fishermen jerry m neff of battelle the ohiobased company that 
conducted the study commissioned by exxon 
state officials said they were skeptical 
its an example of taking a part of the environment and saying 
well this little part is clean and therefore doesnt it follow 
there isnt any damage and there shouldnt be any concern said 
joe ferguson a spokesman for the departmant of environmental 
conservation 
the exxon valdez oil tanker went aground on bligh reef near 
valdez on march 24 1989 in the months following the disaster oil 
coated hundreds of miles of shoreline and killed countless birds 
otters and other sea mammals 
the study involved 2300 water samples taken from locations 
throughout prince william sound starting one week after the spill 
and extending through october according to the report accompanying 
it 
samples mostly came from shallow areas of the water column the 
portion of water between the ocean bottom and 3 to 9 feet below the 
waters surface neff said 
scientists found that the level of toxins from the crude oil 
including benzene and xylene fell rapidly in the weeks and months 
after the spill and were not sufficient to affect fish plants or 
animals 
the report did not attempt to assess contamination or its 
effects at the ocean bottom or at the surface 
we are encouraged by the results of this report and hope that 
those people most intimately linked with the water quality of 
prince william sound are equally encouraged said exxon spokesman 
karsten rodvik 
but ferguson said the report showed exxon was more interested in 
public relations than in sharing data about contamination from the 
spill 
the report was designed to diminish and lessen peoples 
perception of what might be wrong he said 
the report said thin sheens of weathered crude found on the 
surface of the water in some spots pose no threat to either fish or 
animals below or on the surface 
but state scientists who have analyzed the effects of the spill 
and who had seen the battelle report said shoreline contamination 
and not the water column is the real problem ferguson said 
jack lamb vice president of cordova district fishermens 
united said the study would ease a lot of the concerns but 
the report said pollution was highest last april and may when the 
fry were leaving streams and estuaries and feeding on plankton as 
they headed for the open ocean 
were still going to have concerns about how that affected the 
outgoing fry lamb said

us authorities now believe a fire at a

that burn marks were painted on the building the washington post

it clearly was an attempt at deception an unidentified 
senior intelligence official told the newspaper in a story 
published in todays editions its not particularly well done

the united states and other countries of being responsible for 
setting it on fire in early march 
by the end of last month us officials were saying that the 
damage at the plant was not as extensive as previously believed 
state department spokesman richard boucher said then that the 
possibility of a fake fire could not be ruled out

the food and drug administration says new 
warnings will be required on overthecounter aspirin products 
advising women in the last three months of pregnancy not to use the 
products unless directed by a physician 
aspirin late in pregnancy can affect fetal circulation and 
uterine contractions and cause excessive bleeding during delivery 
an fda spokeswoman said friday 
a thirdtrimester pregnancy warning is already required on 
nonprescription ibuprofen products 
acting fda commissioner james benson detailed the agencys plans 
in a march 29 letter to thomas warriner under secretary of the 
california health and welfare agency 
benson said he was aware of the states interest in preparing a 
similar warning under proposition 65 californias antitoxics law 
and wanted officials there to know fdas plans 
benson said the warning would likely be similar to the ibuprofen 
warning which says it is especially important not to use 
ibuprofen during the last three months of pregnancy unless 
specifically directed to do so by your doctor because it may cause 
problems in the unborn child or complications during delivery 
the warning would take effect immediately and companies would 
have one year to make the label changes he said 
aspirin labels already advise pregnant women and nursing mothers 
to get the advice of a health professional before using the product

a personality disorder prevented john e 
list from seeing solutions to his problems and like a tightly 
stretched rubberband he snapped and massacred his family a 
psychiatrist testified 
list a devout lutheran was a man who was being bombarded 
with stresses that he was taught to contain dr sheldon i 
miller said friday the fifth day of lists trial he believed 
that in doing what he did his family was allowed to join god 
list has admitted killing his wife helen 46 mother alma 85 
and three children in their westfield mansion on nov 9 1971 he 
was arrested in june in virginia where he had been living under a 
different name 
lists defense is that he is innocent by reason of mental 
disease or defect 
list was afflicted with an obsessivecompulsive disorder 
that made him a perfectionist preoccupied with details excessively 
devoted to work inflexible in his morality and unable to express 
emotion miller testified in lists defense 
he grew up emotionally impoverished virtually friendless 
and imbued with religion under an authoritarian father who taught 
that anything less than complete selfsufficiency was not manly 
and inappropriate miller said 
but list saw he could no longer support his family and could 
arrive at only two options welfare which was impossible because 
of his background and killing his family 
if the jury finds that because of lists mental state he did not 
act premeditatively willfully deliberately or with malice list 
could be convicted of seconddegree murder or manslaughter rather 
than first degree murder with which he is charged 
earlier friday the jury heard evidence that helen list suffered 
an advanced case of syphilis she had contracted from a previous 
husband and had managed to hide from doctors until 1969 
the disease which she apparently contracted in the 1940s had 
caused atrophy of her brain and caused blindness in her right eye 
said dr henry r liss a neurologist 
doctors who examined her observed her hallucinating speaking to 
an imaginary person and making facial grimaces and lipsmacking 
sounds but didnt realize that syphilis caused her ailments she 
was psychotic schizophrenic defensive and showed a slight tinge 
of paranoia liss said referring to medical records of different

alcohol tobacco and firearms was to help local and state officials 
determine the extent of damage and cause of the fire which quickly 
engulfed the lobby and the eastern half of the 39yearold hotel 
mayor alex daoud who opened his house to survivors unable to

appear suspicious

established

spilled out of doorways as fire raced down the hallways most 
escaped with only the clothes they were wearing

southern california officials have 
adopted what appears to be the nations first comprehensive policy 
to stem global warming and the loss of ozone in the earths 
atmosphere 
it was approved unanimously friday by the governing board of the 
regional south coast air quality management district the agency 
that last year adopted a sweeping antismog plan for the los 
angeles basin 
board member harriet m wieder of orange county alluded to the 
regions notoriety for the nations worst smog saying because 
of our situation here in southern california we should be a leader 
on this issue 
although vermont has adopted a state policy on global warming 
this is the first government i know of to adopt a regulatory 
program said curtis a moore an environmental consultant based 
in mclean va 
the measure proposes restrictions on carbon dioxide and certain 
industrial gases causing the destruction of the earths protective 
ozone layer 
a fourpage statement approved by the board directs the 
districts staff to draw up a series of rules and programs that 
address global warming and ozone problems the major provisions 
will 
require the recycling of chlorofluorocarbon gases or cfcs 
from air conditionsers and refrigerators that are serviced or 
discarded studies have linked cfcs which are widely used as 
refrigerants to the destruction of ozone in the earths outer 
atmosphere 
phase out the use of cfcs and halon gases other 
ozonedestroying compounds widely used in fire extinguishers by 
jan 1 1997 a threeyear extension would be granted in certain 
circumstances 
develop strategies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions the 
board asked its scientific advisory panel to study the feasibility 
of curbing carbon dioxide emissions 20 percent by 2000 and 40 
percent by 2010 
the district also would to support scientific research of 
chemicals that could be used as alternatives to cfcs 
scientists agree that concentrations of carbon dioxide have 
increased in the atmosphere over the past 150 years many argue the 
gas is raising the planets temperature by trapping heat in the 
atmosphere but data is inconclusive 
environmentalists urged the 12member board to strengthen its 
policy by moving up compliance deadlines 
it is vital for the district to adopt effective 
technologyforcing policies to curb global warming and to halt 
depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer said veronica kun of 
the natural resources defense council 
industry executives attacked the plan 
we believe it is premature to implement a policy that so 
clearly assumes there is scientific certainty especially when the 
cost to business the community and society would be so large 
said ross hopkins a lockheed executive who spoke on behalf of the 
california manufacturers association 
hopkins said the district was putting southern california 
businesses at a competitive disadvantage since firms elsewhere 
would operate without the cost of compliance

jesse jackson was the star speaker but marion 
barry nearly stole the show after he quietly slipped into an 
antidrug meeting of the national conference of black mayors 
jackson interrupted his own speech when he spotted the 
washington dc mayor entering the room friday come on up mr 
mayor he said and a crowd of about 400 stood and applauded as 
barry walked to the podium and sat at jacksons right hand 
after jacksons speech reporters and wellwishers swarmed 
barry who recently completed seven weeks of chemical dependency 
treatment after an arrest on cocaine charges 
barry said he saw no irony in his attending the antidrug 
meeting and said his own problem with substance abuse should not be 
linked by the media to the proliferation of drugs in his home city 
what about new york david dinkins has not had this kind of 
personal problem personal disease what about chicago or miami 
florida said barry 
barry has admitted dependency on alcohol and tranquilizers but 
has skirted the issue of cocaine abuse he was arrested jan 18 
during an fbi sting operation and faces trial on five misdemeanor 
cocaine possession charges and three counts of lying to a grand 
jury about his drug involvement 
america has a critical need to solve its problem barry 
said im not going to be the focus of it not me 
barry also was asked about news reports that the bush 
administration is preparing to issue a report that will declare its 
own yearold pilot antidrug program in washington a failure 
i have not seen the report said barry i think theyre 
going to release it next week but as jesse jackson indicated the 
initial approach was wrong 
it was like an exclusionary situation where you come down and 
you propose things for us without talking to us 
jacksons speech was a scathing indictment of bushs war on 
drugs 
he accused the administration not only of failing to get closely 
involved with state and local officials involved in the war but 
also of providing too little money and failing to attack the root 
causes of drug abuse 
among those causes he said were poverty and unemployment 
hell declare a war with the resources and have you fight the 
war without resources voodoo politics said jackson who also 
received a standing ovation from the crowd 
jackson also reiterated his call for government officials to 
develop a plan to make public and private pension funds available 
for investment in lowincome housing and other programs aimed at 
eliminating poverty

top economic officials of the worlds seven richest 
democracies are opening talks on the financial markets which have 
been jittery over the unexpected fall of the japanese yen 
the talks were to begin today and include us treasury 
secretary nicholas brady and finance ministers and central bank 
presidents from britain canada japan france west germany and 
italy the nations are known as the group of seven or g7 
japanese officials are expected to appeal for help in driving up 
the yens value but analysts doubted the other nations would be 
quick to come to their aid 
stephen king an international economist at the london 
investment firm of james capel and co predicted that neither 
the united states nor germany would be willing to help out japan 
that much 
moreover david wyss chief financial economist at drimcgraw 
hill in lexington mass said the yens rise in recent days has 
taken a little bit of pressure off the g7 meeting 
the dollar had shot up against the yen in recent weeks and it 
reached a threeyear high earlier this week since then the yen 
has strengthened some which analysts say reflects the markets 
uncertainty about the results of the finance meeting 
some analysts argued that the united states may agree to 
intervene more heavily in the currency markets to try to prop up 
the yen governments buy and sell currencies in the markets to try 
to alter the value of a currency 
but they ruled out any move by the united states to trim 
interest rates at tokyos request lower us interest rates would 
tend to give a lift to the japanese currency but american 
officials fear they would fuel inflationary pressures at home 
the g7 nations have been trying to coordinate economic policies 
since a campaign in september 1985 to push the dollar lower as a 
way of reducing the us trade deficits 
in february 1987 the reagan administration decided the dollar 
was weak enough in the socalled louvre accord the major 
economies pledged to work to support the dollar at the levels of 
that time 
analysts disagree about whether the countries are still sticking 
to their coordination promises 
there is still some coordination but its not as good as it 
was said wyss 
he said it was easier for the governments to act together when 
their economies were on par but he said the us economy has 
slowed while those in europe continue to expand 
the ministers agenda also was to be taken up by the dramatic 
events that have unfolded in eastern europe since they met in 
september 
west german finance minister theo waigel and karl otto poehl 
the president of the west german central bank were expected to 
offer details on plans to form an economic and monetary union this 
summer with east germany 
the bonn government has become embroiled in a controversy over 
the conversion rate for exchange of the east german currency to the 
west german mark 
the central bank known as the bundesbank has recommended a 
2to1 rate that would give east germans one west german mark for 
every two units of their currency except for small savings 
accounts which would be traded in at a higher rate 
east germans have complained that the proposed rate would 
effectively cut in half their wages pensions and other savings

president chaim herzog has given his support to 
a growing public campaign to reform the electoral system which has 
put minor political parties in the role of kingmakers and 
deadlocked the government 
by friday at least 70000 israelis had signed petitions 
demanding changes such as direct election of the prime minister and 
legislators voters now cast ballots for party slates 
reformers say the current method does not make legislators 
accountable to voters they also say the system of giving any party 
with 1 percent of the vote a seat in parliament gives small parties 
too much leverage 
a wide range of political religious and student organizations 
urged members to attend a protest rally in tel aviv today on 
friday more than 20 people were on a hunger strike outside the 
parliament building 
in a statement released friday herzog said he welcomed the 
actions of the protesters but urged them to end the fast so they 
would not endanger their health 
the president is for changing the electoral system said 
herzogs spokesman giora pordes 
the protests came as the leftleaning labor party tried to form 
a ruling coalition and the rival rightwing likud bloc moved to 
torpedo labors efforts 
the two parties have been stalemated since the government 
collapsed march 15 labor leader shimon peres announced this week 
that he put together a majority in the 120seat parliament or 
knesset but would not identify his backers 
israel radio reported that labor signed a deal with likud 
defector avraham sharir a former tourism minister 
critics have accused labor and likud of using offers of 
government money and political jobs to entice small ultraorthodox 
parties to join their side and allow the formation of a government 
on friday labor reportedly tried to persuade four wavering 
sharir allies to abandon likud peres has offered one of them 
economics minister yitzhak modai the finance ministry in a labor 
government the radio said 
modai sought offers from peres after several likud leaders 
refused his demands for a 25 million bank guarantee to back up 
the partys promise to make him a likud cabinet minister 
the public campaign against backroom deals with smaller parties 
began march 28 when two army reserve officers began a hunger strike 
in front of parliament more than 20 people have joined the strike 
the hunger strikers have collected more than 25000 signatures 
in addition to 40000 gathered by the association of americans and 
canadians in israel and 5000 sent to the president by university 
students from haifa and jerusalem 
the momentum is enormous said political science professor 
ehud sprinzak the campaigns organizer in jerusalem we are 
trying to galvanize it into a huge political movement 
in addition to herzog other prominent israelis spoke out for 
reform friday including natan sharansky a former soviet dissident 
and activist for soviet jewish immigration 
former president jimmy carter said friday he believed peace 
prospects would be greatest under a laborled government 
my last preference would be another laborlikud national 
unity government which i think reaches the lowest common 
denominator of inactivity and stalemate carter said during a 
visit to stockholm likud and labor have ruled jointly since the 
1984 election ended in a stalemate 
also friday three small leftwing parties courted by peres 
demanded that a labor government lift some of the harsh measures 
imposed by the army to suppress the 27monthold palestinian 
uprising

a 37year fight to desegregate schools in 
impoverished st helena parish supposedly ended last year when 
blacks and whites began attending classes under the same roof 
but when white school board members fired the black 
superintendent it showed the fight was far from over 
the firing which apparently was decided at a closed meeting and 
never publicly explained led superintendent perry spears to take 
his firing to court in baton rouge where the federal judge who has 
overseen the parishs desegragation once more will take up charges 
of racism 
it led students and teachers to boycott classes and created a 
sense of disbelief in activists who thought their efforts to 
integrate schools in this severely depressed rural parish were over 
and done with 
if i wasnt in this situation id find it hard to believe 
said spears who is scheduled to leave office june 30 after the 
school board ignored his request for a new contract and hired a 
white to replace him 
the school board doesnt intend to do what the court tells 
them said john hall one of the original plaintiffs in the 
desegregation suit 
us district judge john parker has scheduled a hearing for 
april 19 to hear complaints that spears removal was racially 
motivated 
the school boards four white members who already had made 
their decision to oust spears announced his replacement at a jan 
2 meeting where they outnumbered the two black board members who 
wanted to keep him 
it came as a total shock spears said 
willie george lee one of the black board members said he knew 
nothing about the move until it was put on the agenda at the last 
minute 
i think its unjust lee said i think he has done an 
excellent job 
spears who has worked in the district for 27 years and has been 
superintendent for five years won a state court order to stay on 
the job through the end of the school year myrtie wofford a white 
former elementary principal was hired to replace him 
after the board refused to explain its reasons for replacing 
spears about half of the districts teachers stayed out and about 
70 percent of the districts 2000 students boycotted classes for a 
week in february 
the school district is about 70 percent black 
desegregation efforts began in the 1952 when a lawsuit was 
filed after the district just south of the mississippi border 
refused to build a new school for blacks 
in january 1989 the school board closed four of the districts 
dilapidated school buildings and consolidated all classes into 
three buildings parker approved the move although it apparently 
was motivated as much by the lack of parish funds to keep all the 
schools open as by the integration order 
parker had described the districts schools as not fit for a 
doghouse 
the st helena parish system is ranked as one of louisianas 
poorest about 95 percent of its financial support coming from the 
state 
some elementary school students attend classes in converted 
mobile homes one school had to be closed because the district 
could not afford the 100000 needed to remove loose asbestos 
attorney robert williams who is representing the plaintiffs in 
the desegregation case said he wants to find out if spears 
dismissal is the result of racial blacklash 
if this man is carrying out court orders and being retaliated 
against we want the court to do something about it i dont know 
if thats the case williams said 
williams added 
in december this guy is the greatest thing since ice cream 
in january you replace him without advertising no one is saying 
what happened he was replaced by somebody they obviously had 
interviewed where did you interview her it obviously was a secret 
proceeding the position was never declared vacant it was open and 
gone in one bold stroke 
spears said two white board members told him they were 
pressured apparently by whites who did not approve of sending 
their children to school with blacks 
both said id done a good job but they just couldnt vote for 
me he said 
robert easley one of the white board members said he felt it 
was time for a change at the helm 
for five years everything had been in turmoil and everything 
had been going for him we were last on the state test and the 
system had just collapsed easley said 
as far as racism on my part no sir he said 
easley said he was not involved in any interviews for spears 
replacement wofford deferred comment to the boards attorney 
clifford speed who said the allegations involving spears 
replacement took place before he began representing the district in 
march 
consolidation of the schools has saved the district money and 
enabled schools to offer a wider curriculum spears said in 
addition a breakfast program has been started in the district for 
the first time he said 
but easley said public support was lacking for the school system 
and was demonstrated last fall when a bond issue was overwhelmingly 
defeated

us businessmen trying to penetrate japans market 
often express frustration at the clubby nature of much of this 
countrys business and the trade reforms japan will undertake are 
meant to promote competition 
japan and the united states announced an agreement on the 
reforms thursday 
the government issued a report friday outlining its plans to 
change the deepseated business practices that contribute to the 
united states 49 billion trade deficit with japan 
it said the fair trade commission will subject the countrys 
corporate groups known as keiretsu to audits every two years 
companies within such a group own each others stock and buy 
products and services from each other excluding foreign companies 
or raising their costs 
the report said the audits will look at suppliercustomer 
transactions financing arrangements and personal ties 
the commission is to publish its findings and take steps 
including stricter enforcement of the antimonopoly act to address 
anticompetitive and exclusionary practices the report said 
in addition government powers to restrict foreign investment or 
technology imports on grounds they might adversely affect japanese 
companies will be revised the report said 
such restrictions are not needed on a general basis the 
report said 
the commission also promised to simplify procedures for 
corporate mergers and acquisitions foreigners complain that 
present rules hinder them from putting their money to work in japan 
the government said however there were sound economic reasons 
for forming corporate groups 
in the latest issue of economic eye magazine an analyst 
ryutaro komiya said the groups did not deserve the criticism they 
received 
he said that while the sales of us automaker general motors 
are more than double those of japans no 1 automaker toyota 
its employees are 13 times more numerous 
toyota contracts out much of the work that gm handles 
inhouse thus the toyota group of subcontractors is akin to gms 
internal divisions its not a question of good vs bad business 
arrangements komiya said 
he said that within a keiretsu a firm will get no sympathy 
or sales from other group members with products that are more 
expensive or of lower quality than market standards 
another point of contention between the united states and japan 
has been japans policies on retailing the government protects 
small shops by requiring large stores to obtain the consent of 
their smaller neighbors before opening the process can take 10 
years 
while refusing to abolish the law the government promised 
revisions including a shortening of this coordination processing 
period to less than 18 months if problems persist the 
government may decide in three years to exempt parts of japan from 
the law the report said 
the supermarket chain life stores co said last week it was 
suing the government for the equivalent of 63 million on grounds 
it suffered losses from not being allowed to open a new branch 
on friday toshiaki namiki a spokesman for the company said 
the promise of change would not lead the company to drop its suit 
he said its aim was to attack the law not to win compensation 
the united states has argued that the reforms would help 
japanese consumers who pay some of the worlds highest prices 
because of the complex distribution system and myriad government 
regulations 
but some consumers see advantages in the small stores consumer 
groups have said cultural aspects and community relationships 
should also be taken into consideration

a mother who gave birth so her 
leukemiastricken daughter might be saved with the newborns bone 
marrow said she wants a normal life for the baby despite its 
muchpublicized prenatal existence 
weve been saving all the articles from magazines and 
everything and when shes old enough to understand well give her 
the big scrapbooks mary ayala said she will know all about 
it 
mary 43 delivered marissa eve at the queen of the valley 
hospital but it does not bring an automatic reprieve for her 
daughter anissa 18 because the baby will not be ready to donate 
marrow for six months 
initial tests showed the newborn would be a compatible donor and 
it was a virtual 100 percent certainty that marissas marrow 
cells will be a match for anissa said charles mathews spokesman 
for city of hope national medical center where the transplant will 
be performed 
the baby was in the headlines since the ayalas revealed eight 
weeks ago that they had conceived her as a last resort to save the 
life of anissa 
the ayalas took the step of having another child after waiting 
for almost two years for the national marrow donor program to find 
a suitable donor 
but friday mary ayala said her first thought was for the baby 
we havent even bothered to ask about the transplant or talked 
to city of hope yet she said im going to stay home and take 
care of my baby 
anissa said at a news conference she would love her newborn 
sister regardless of whether the baby can save her life 
im just really glad shes here anissa said i love my 
little sister 
mary ayala said if i had it to do again now that its all 
over i dont think i would change anything im happy everything 
has gone the way it has 
leukemia a cancer of white blood cells typically is treated by 
killing bloodproducing cells with chemotherapy or radiation 
marrow from a matching donor usually a sibling is then 
transplanted into the leukemia patient so the healthy stem cells 
can produce healthy blood cells 
dr rudolf brutoco said anissa could still face a crisis if her 
disease advances were keeping our fingers crossed she stays 
healthy he said 
the baby was delivered tuesday by caesarean section without 
complications the baby was handed to the father abe ayala who 
held her as the mother gave her a kiss doctors said

sc johnson and son inc said it was 
voluntarily withdrawing its deep woods off insect repellent from 
retail stores because test animals developed tumors in response to 
an ingredient 
the withdrawal friday affects about 150000 cases of aerosol and 
pump containers and boxes of towelettes johnson spokesman david 
coronna said 
a company statement called the withdrawal precautionary saying 
it was not aware of any reports of adverse human health effects 
the action does not involve other johnson repellents 
the company said an ingredient that repels biting flies r11 or 
2 butylene tetrahydro2furaldehyde showed adverse effects to 
some laboratory animals which were fed high levels of r11 in 
preliminary research 
preliminary data in one test showed laboratory mice developed a 
nonmalignant tumor said roger grothaus vice president of 
scientific support and government affairs for johnson 
grothaus said r11 has been used in deep woods off for 17 years 
and as a repellent ingredient by other companies for many years 
the chemical was being tested for a recertification requirement 
coronna had no estimate of the cost of the withdrawal he said 
there was no immediate decision on whether to provide refunds to 
customers 
the company said it was providing a tollfree telephone number 
18005585252 for customer questions starting monday

dutch police released the jobless 
and distraught man arrested for spraying acid onto rembrandts 
the night watch on condition he seek psychiatric help police 
said today 
the 31yearold suspect released late friday may still face a 
maximimum oneyear prison term if convicted of vandalizing the 
netherlands most famous painting in the rijksmuseum here police 
spokesman klaas wilting said 
the man was freed shortly after an interview with prosecutors 
who decided to let him go provided he talk to a psychiatrist 
wilting said 
it was not immediately clear how psychiatric counseling could be 
imposed as a condition for his release the suspect a resident of 
the hague has not been identified in line with dutch police 
practice 
the man described by police on friday as confused was 
arrested by museum guards immediately after he sprayed acid on the 
huge 1642 rembrandt 
guards immediately applied a neutralizing agent on the painting 
damage to the work was minimal since the acid apparently failed 
to eat through the thick layer of veneer protecting the delicate 
paint museum officials said 
wilting said the suspect could only be prosecuted for vandalism 
even if it was a very expensive painting that charge carries a 
oneyear maximum prison term 
it was the third attack this century on the night watch the 
dutch masters most vandalized work 
in 1975 a disturbed schoolmaster made 13 slashes in work with a 
knife he had stolen from a restaurant minutes earlier the man 
later committed suicide in a mental asylum 
during world war i an umemployed shoemaker slashed the painting 
to protest his inability to find work

gaining statehood could cause puerto rico to 
lose up to 100000 of the 900000 jobs on the island according to 
a government study 
the study released thursday by the congressional budget office 
addressed the elimination of tax benefits aimed at stimulating 
investment in the island the new york times reported in todays 
editions 
private us investment which now makes up half the islands 
22 billion private investment would drop 73 percent in a puerto 
rican state the study said statehood would spell the end of an 
estimated 2 billion a year in tax benefits designed to encourage 
investment 
the island which currently has an 82 million ceiling on 
federal money for social programs would gain an additional 36 
billion in federal spending by the year 2000 
but the net effect of statehood would be a 43 percent drop in 
the islands gross product by the decades end the report said 
the study is sure to have an impact on the decadeslong debate 
over statehood independence or continued commonwealth status for 
the island 
gov rafael hernandez colon and other opponents of statehood 
who fear voters would be attracted to statehood by the promise of 
additional social programs paid for by washington hailed the 
report 
my position has always been that the future of puerto rico 
cannot be decided by how much the people would receive in social 
legislation colon said in the times 
supporters of statehood or independence maintain that the report 
failed to take into account certain intangibles such as the fact 
that doubt about the island already has dampened investment said 
former gov carlos romero barcelo 
an independent puerto rico would lose federal revenue but might 
be able to maintain investment through incentives to foreign 
businesses the report said 
congress commissioned the study from the cbo its research arm 
to give it direction while it considers a bill to allow a 1991 
referendum on puerto ricos political future 
puerto rican currently has a 16 percent jobless rate

the state has declared war on a breed of 
crickets that can grow to the size of mice and bite people who 
interfere with their ravenous feeding 
the mormon crickets which can reach two inches in length are 
hatching across 700000 acres in five rural counties in the states 
largest infestation since the 1930s near winnemucca 150 miles 
northeast of reno 100 crickets have been counted per square foot 
theyre in the canyons right now and our goal is to kill them 
before they reach the valleys and the towns where they can do some 
real damage robert gronowski director of the nevada department 
of agricultures plant industry program said friday 
if we stop them in the mountains i think weve got the problem 
licked but we couldnt wipe out the entire population no matter 
what we did gronowski said 
once on the march the crickets will leave barren land in their 
wake eating the bark off trees and even dining on each other if 
food is scarce they will bite people if disturbed 
once they start marching it becomes much tougher to stop 
them gronowski said but right now theyre still young and 
arent really on the move so weve got an opportunity to do 
something to control them 
mormon crickets which actually are relatives of grasshoppers 
and katydids got their name from an infestation in utah in the 
1800s that ended when sea gulls from salt lake city reportedly flew 
over the land and ate the insects 
the battle plan worked out by state and us agriculture 
officials begins tuesday with spreading a poisonlaced bran and oil 
mixture on egg beds at the mouths of canyons where the insects are 
hatching 
the insecticide isnt harmful to larger animals or people 
according to gronowski someone would have to eat a lot of it to 
even get sick 
aerial spraying will begin april 23 in infested rural areas 
where there arent any rivers to get polluted by the insecticide 
the program is expected to cost 25000 to 80000 which will 
be picked up by the federal government because the infestation is 
on bureau of land management property gronowski said 
well keep the baiting and spraying programs going until the 
crickets start laying eggs about july 15 he explained the 
insects die after laying their eggs 
that should be the end of the problem but theres no way to 
tell if theyll come back like this next year or in 10 years well 
just have to wait and see he said 
if the program doesnt keep the insects out of crops and towns 
gronowski said authorities might have to get private ranchers and 
farmers involved in killing them 
agricultural officials say they believe this years large 
infestation occurred because three years of drought allowed large 
egg beds to accumulate and there were no extremes of heat or cold 
to kill them

plo chairman yasser arafat said he has had secret 
contacts with israeli leaders to discuss middle east peace and the 
palestinian uprising in isaraelioccupied lands 
but later friday an israeli un official in new york 
categorically denied any such contacts the israeli government 
has refused to negotiate the palestinian question directly with the 
plo which it considers a terrorist organization 
arafats remarks on italys stateowned rai television were 
broadcast hours after the palestinian leader met for the third time 
in eight years with pope john paul ii 
asked whether he had clandestine contact with israel arafat 
replied yes there is there are many contacts between the 
palestinian and israeli leadership 
he said former defense minister yitzhak rabin sent an emissary 
with a message for me he said prime minister yitzhak shamir 
also did so 
yuval rotem spokesman for the israeli un mission in new york 
denied arafats statement he said arafat may have referred to 
talks israeli leaders held last summer with palestinians to advance 
an israeli peace plan 
arafat and the plo is a nonstarter to any negotiations 
rotem said 
he said arafat made the latest claim because hes looking for 
legitimacy from the israelis 
there have been rumors of contact between israeli and palestine 
liberation organization leaders but they had not been independently 
confirmed israel says the plo is bent on destruction of the jewish 
state 
shamir dismissed science minister ezer weitzman from israels 
inner cabinet last december for having contacts with the plo 
the shamir coalition government collapsed march 15 in a dispute 
over a usbacked proposal that calls for preliminary meetings 
with palestinians to discuss proposed elections in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
the labor party backed the plan but it was opposed by likud its 
coalition partner led by shamir 
arafat said the messages he had received from the israeli 
leaders regarded the intefadeh some aspects of the peace 
initiative messages that illustrate their point of view about 
them 
intefadeh is the arab name for the palestinian revolt that began 
in december 1987 against israeli rule in the west bank and gaza 
strip at least 875 palestinians and 43 israelis have died in 
uprising violence 
asked what israel wanted arafat said with whom are they 
going to make peace with phantoms with me 
he compared israeli leaders to ostriches for refusing to deal 
officially with the plo 
they put their heads in the sand refusing to face reality 
he said in comments translated into italian they dont want to 
walk in the direction of history some of them think they can hide 
the sun with a finger 
earlier friday the pope urged the palestinian leader to pursue 
dialogue israel criticized the meeting as it did the two previous 
encounters between the pope and arafat in 1982 and 1988 
arafat on a european trip aimed at increasing pressure on 
israel to negotiate said thursday he was willing to meet israeli 
labor leader shimon peres to advance the peace process if the 
politician succeeds in his effort to form a government 
arafat said he and the pope discussed the palestinian question 
from all angles and ways and means of establishing a just 
comprehensive peace

a superior court judge said vermonts 
costcutting ban on civil jury trials is unconstitutional because 
it subjects a fundamental civil right to a price tag 
but the ruling by superior court judge frank mahady only applies 
to the case of a widow seeking a 15000 payment from her late 
husbands insurance company the civil jury trial moratorium will 
remain in effect in all other state courts unless judges there make 
similar rulings said john evers the middlebury attorney 
representing the widow 
jerome f oneill president of the vermont trial lawyers 
association said he hopes other judges soon will follow mahadys 
lead 
i certainly expect it will have significant precedential value 
in any future case oneill said friday challenges are pending 
around the state and i expect youll be hearing about them in the 
near future 
the lawyers association has filed a classaction lawsuit to 
overturn the ban saying it violates the constitutional right to a 
speedy trial that lawsuit is pending in vermont supreme court 
the widows suit which began in 1985 was scheduled to go to a 
civil jury trial earlier this year 
but the state supreme court postponed all civil jury trials from 
jan 22 through june 30 because of cuts in the judiciarys budget 
the courts were ordered by the legislature to make about 300000 
in cuts this fiscal year which ends june 30 to help avert a state 
budget deficit 
the moratorium is expected to save about 75000 
in his ruling mahady said the seventh amendment to the us 
constitution and several sections of the vermont constitution 
guarantee a citizens right to a trial by jury both in criminal 
and civil matters 
no government official no branch of government in our free 
society dare subject such a right so honored by our people for 
centuries to a price tag mahady said 
placed in the admittedly awkward position of being required to 
resolve a conflict between an administrative order of its supreme 
court and the clear mandate of the constitution this court with 
great respect for the supreme court will stand fast by the 
constitution 
thomas lehner vermont court administrator and clerk of the 
vermont supreme court could not be reached for comment friday 
although the specific impact of this ban is not known court 
officials have said about 50 cases go to jury verdict and another 
300500 cases are called in for jury drawing during a typical 
sixmonth period

economics officials of the seven leading industrial 
powers met today to discuss the turmoil in japans financial 
markets but they appeared unlikely to do much to prop up the yen 
currency 
theres no reason to unnecessarily dramatize developments in 
japan said a senior west german finance official who spoke to 
reporters before the start of daylong talks at the french finance 
ministry 
the gathering of the socalled group of seven britain canada 
france west germany japan italy and the united states was the 
first formal session of the year 
the west german official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the yens recent weakness did not pose a danger to the 
international economy 
i dont see any reason to consider the japanese situation a 
mediumterm destabilizing factor in the world economy he said 
but japanese officials obviously worried about their 
oncemighty currency were expected to appeal to us treasury 
secretary nicholas brady and the other finance chiefs for help 
a japanese official accompanying the finance minister ryutaro 
hashimoto said the industrialized nations believe the decline in 
yen was a problem for all 
the official who also spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
dollar has not strengthened significantly but rather the value of 
the yen has fallen thats where the difficulty lies he told 
japanese reporters 
the value of the dollar reached a threeyear high earlier in the 
week the yen has since firmed some reflecting according to 
analysts uncertainty about the outcome of the finance ministers 
meeting 
brady and hashimoto were among the string of finance ministers 
and central bank presidents who arrived by car at the modern 
glassandsteel building housing the french finance ministry on the 
eastern edge of paris 
the officials talks were expected to end by early evening it 
was uncertain whether they would issue a statement at the 
conclusion 
in advance of the meeting analysts said they doubted the united 
states and the others would be quick to come to the aid of the 
tokyo government 
stephen king an international economist at the london 
investment firm of james capel and co predicted that neither 
the united states nor germany would be willing to help out japan 
that much 
moreover david wyss chief financial economist at drimcgraw 
hill in lexington mass said the yens rise in recent days has 
taken a little bit of pressure off the g7 meeting 
some analysts argued that the united states may agree to 
intervene more heavily in the currency markets to try to prop up 
the yen governments buy and sell currencies in the markets to try 
to alter the value of a currency 
but they ruled out any move by the united states to trim 
interest rates at tokyos request lower us interest rates would 
tend to give a lift to the japanese currency but american 
officials fear they would fuel inflationary pressures at home 
the g7 nations have been trying to coordinate economic policies 
since a campaign in september 1985 to push the dollar lower as a 
way of reducing the us trade deficits 
in february 1987 the reagan administration decided the dollar 
was weak enough in the socalled louvre accord the major 
economies pledged to work to support the dollar at the levels of 
that time 
analysts disagree about whether the countries are still sticking 
to their coordination promises 
there is still some coordination but its not as good as it 
was said wyss 
he said it was easier for the governments to act together when 
their economies were on par but he said the us economy has 
slowed while those in europe continue to expand 
the ministers agenda also was to be taken up by the dramatic 
events that have unfolded in eastern europe since they met in 
september 
west german finance minister theo waigel and karl otto poehl 
the president of the west german central bank were expected to 
offer details on plans to form an economic and monetary union this 
summer with east germany 
the bonn government has become embroiled in a controversy over 
the conversion rate for exchange of the east german currency to the 
west german mark 
the central bank known as the bundesbank has recommended a 
2to1 rate that would give east germans one west german mark for 
every two units of their currency except for small savings 
accounts which would be traded in at a higher rate 
east germans have complained that the proposed rate would 
effectively cut in half their wages pensions and other savings

even though the sex life of a football 
referee and dogs i have known didnt make bookofthemonth 
club they still deserved to be promoted 
thats the finding of a jury which on friday awarded 35 
million in a 13yearold lawsuit charging one of the nations 
largest vanity publishers with fraud and deception 
the 11 million class action suit represents thousands of 
authors who have paid up to 8000 to have their book manuscripts 
published by new yorkbased vantage press since 1971 
vantage operates a sham operation rife with fraud and phantom 
editors said arthur j jacobs attorney for the authors 
but laurence shanahan a lawyer for the publisher said 
vantage did exactly what it promised these authors by 
publishing their works and advertising them in mailings and small 
trade publications 
vantage publishes about 400 books a year 
the civil suit claimed vantage press which advertises a

greece could end up with another coalition 
government after voters go to the polls sunday and that could mean 
a continued impasse over how to deal with growing economic problems 
temporary coalitions have run the country since the 
scandalridden socialists were ousted last year after eight years 
in power 
opinion polls indicate than no one party will gain a majority in 
the balloting for the 300seat unicameral parliament the third 
election in less than a year that would mean that one of greeces 
small parties could have a pivotal role in forming the next 
government 
with 17 percent inflation and a 15 billion budget deficit the 
european community says greece is in danger of bankruptcy 
the economic problems spurred by the lack of government 
cohesion has led to frustration and violence 
leftist terrorists have called for an election boycott and have 
set off scores of bombs conservatives and socialists have clashed 
constantine mitsotakis conservative new democracy party thinks 
it has the best chance of winning the necessary 151 seats for an 
absolute majority in novembers elections it won 148 seats two 
more than it received in the june vote which knocked prime 
minister andreas papandreou and his panhellenic socialist movement 
party from power 
the conservatives and the small communistled coalition of the 
left and progress teamed up after the june vote 
with new democracy deputy tzannis tzannetakis as premier the 
alliance presided over the indictment of papandreou and some of his 
ministers on charges of involvement in financial scandals and 
illegal wiretapping of political opponents a trial date has not 
been set 
in february another alliance of the conservatives socialists 
and communists collapsed after it was unable to confront economic 
problems or stem a resurgence of urban terrorism 
prime minister xenophon zolotas 86 a former governor of the 
bank of greece remains in charge until a new government is chosen 
if no party wins a majority in the elections parties with one 
or two seats in parliament could wield considerable influence 
i see all parties falling slightly said pollster panayote 
dimitras but the coalition communists could fall a little more 
because of protest votes that may go to the 
environmentalistalternative party or blank ballots he said that 
if the environmental party which won one seat in the last 
election gains one or two more seats they could also become the 
key to power 
the 71yearold papandreou whose party finished a close second 
in november does not have a specific platform but has promised 
stability and progress 
mitsotakis also 71 has promised to increase private investment 
as a way to create 100000 jobs he ended his campaign friday with 
a rally that drew tens of thousands in athens 
these elections are not between left and right mitsotakis 
told supporters the real choice is between progress and 
regression 
conservatives and socialists disagree over us military bases 
in greece new democracy wants the bases and nato membership 
saying they are essential for defense the socialists say any 
future bases agreement should be put to a referendum 
communist leaders offered nothing new in their party platform 
but repeated their pledge to protect workers rights

a helicopter flew low over 
strangeways prison early today to disturb the sleep of rebellious 
inmates and barking dogs shouting guards and spotlights were also 
used to wear down a weeklong siege 
prison governor brendan ofriel told reporters that fewer than 
25 prisoners remained inside the prison which was heavily damaged 
in a riot that broke out at a chapel service on sunday 
we have been using a certain amount of noise tactics to reduce 
the in our view unauthorized access of prisoners to the media 
ofriel said we have continued to put pressure on the prisoners 
in other ways 
but he said authorities still hoped to negotiate an end to the 
impasse 
earlier lines of shouting prison officers beating nightsticks 
on riot shields and accompanied by barking guard dogs marched into 
the building where the defiant inmates are holed up behind 
barricades 
inmates appeared on the roof and one was heard chanting we 
won we won you lost 
a flickering strobe light played repeatedly over the roof of the 
prison in the northern city of manchester 
on friday prison authorities used blaring rock music and a 
wailing helicopter siren to drown out inmates shouting from the 
rooftop to reporters outside the prisons perimeter wall 
the home office said two more prisoners surrendered friday 
prisoner derek white 46 died in north manchester hospital on 
tuesday of injuries he suffered at the hands of other inmates when 
the riot began white had been in strangeways awaiting trial on 
charges of indecently assaulting three children 
child molesters convicted policemen and some other groups are 
regarded with particular loathing by other prison inmates 
whites death was the only confirmed fatality resulting from the 
riot 
but speculation that at least four other prisoners were killed 
by fellow inmates on sunday increased when a lawyer for 40 
prisoners who surrendered said friday that several reported 
witnessing killings 
lawyers for other prisoners had heard similar tales the 
attorney frank sinclair said 
the reports cannot be checked until staff have access to the 
entire prison 
strangeways housed prisoners of all categories from extremely 
dangerous to low risk 
strangeways prison which was built in 1868 to house 970 male 
prisoners had 1648 when the riot there broke out during a service 
in the prison chapel 
on thursday prisoner paul taylor 28 a selfprofessed leader 
of the rampage shouted through a makeshift bullhorn to a tv crew 
perched on a roof opposite the prison 
he said he had grabbed the chaplains microphone during the 
service as a prelude to a planned sitin to protest conditions in 
the overcrowded jail he said he had not meant to start a riot 
when taylor started shouting through the bullhorn friday the 
authorities set up a counterblast of noise 
in a separate incident 80 miles southeast of manchester 36 
inmates at glen parva center for young offenders at leicester 
surrendered to guards before dawn today the prisoners had held the 
guards at bay more than seven hours the home office said 
it said the protest at the glen parva center began friday night 
when 60 inmates overpowered a guard he was taken to a hospital 
with a dislocated shoulder twentyfour of the 60 surrendered later 
friday night and the other 36 held out until early today 
glen parva houses 770 young male offenders ages 16 to 20 the 
home office said the cause of the disturbance was being 
investigated

moslem guerrillas said today that 
they dealt a major blow to the afghan government when they turned a 
surrender ceremony for 10000 guerrillas into a surprise attack 
najibullah lefrey information minister of the selfproclaimed 
rebel governmentinexile said fridays guerrilla attack in herat 
province was a setback to president najibs claims that tens of 
thousands of rebel fighters are changing sides and embracing his 
sovietbacked government 
jamiatiislami considered the most effective of the seven 
pakistanbased fighting forces claimed the surprise attack on the 
herat plains was planned five months ago to trap government forces 
it apparently was intended to avenge a similar deadly trick by 
government forces 11 years ago 
the guerrillas had invited afghan officials to what they said 
would be the surrender of 10000 rebels but instead opened fire on 
their hosts setting off a gun battle that left many dead on both 
sides 
western diplomats in pakistan said on condition of anonymity 
that they had reports that up to five afghan generals were killed 
or wounded in the 15minute gun battle and in handtohand combat 
with knives and pistols they also said civilians including 
children died in the fighting on the plains outside herat 400 
miles west of the afghan capital of kabul 
governmentrun kabul radio said at least a dozen people were 
killed including lt gen jalal razaminda who is also deputy 
security minister a second unidentified general civilians and 
nine guerrillas 
an official rebel news agency midia claimed that six generals 
25 communist party members and several top government bureaucrats 
were killed in the attack the agency said 100 others were injured 
the guerrillas lured government troops into the ambush saying 
they would surrender their weapons and support the national 
reconcilation policy of sovietbacked president najib the 
government uses the term national reconcilation to signify 
agreement by local guerrilla groups to switch sides and either stop 
fighting or help the marxist government in the war it has fought 
with rebels since seizing power in a 1978 coup 
the government says tens of thousands of rebels have laid down 
their weapons in the past year 
diplomats based in kabul and a small group of foreign 
journalists were flown to herat for the ceremony and dove for cover 
during the intense closerange battle kabul radio said 
the radio said 2200 armed guerrillas and 8000 unarmed rebels 
had gathered on the plains about 25 miles from the city of herat 
for the surrender ceremony 
the guerrillas with weapons ranging from side arms to 
recoilless cannons missiles and rocket launchers opened fired at 
the government officials and soldiers western diplomats and rebel 
leaders said the guerrillas fired the first shot when the 
provincial governor fazle haq khaliq yaar embraced an 
unidentified guerrilla commander dressed in a white robe and turban 
yaar was reportedly wounded in the incident 
the diplomats said the governors guards immediately returned 
fire and the ceremony became a pitched battle with massive 
exchanges of gunfire 
the diplomats said the shooting stopped when two afghan army 
tanks moved in with bursts of fire 
an afghan national tv cameraman was reported shot in the head 
and badly wounded in the fighting 
in order to stop the propaganda show of the puppet regime 
some mujahedeen holy rebels decided to give their lives to kill 
the people responsible for the show lefrey said this attack 
shows that the puppet regime has just been launching a lot of 
propaganda about national reconciliation 
no one is joining the regime they just parade the militia for 
show and say they are mujahedeen he said 
najib has organized thousands of afghan villagers into milita 
forces to supplement his army 
the rebels have been fighting for 12 years to topple successive 
communist governments in afghanistan they are supported by the 
united states saudi arabia and other arab states 
after the last soviet soldiers ended nine years of direct 
intervention in afghanistan in february 1989 western diplomats 
predicted najib would fall within weeks or months but the rebels 
has been partially paralyzed by bitter infighting and have failed 
to win any major battle 
najib emerged a formidable opponent taking the political 
initiative with offers to end the fighting 
herat was the first region in afghanistan to rise against the 
government in early 1979 before the red army stepped in to bolster 
the marxist government 
the soviet union withdrew its troops in february 1989 but still 
sends huge quantities of supplies and weapons to the kabul 
government

a long march 3 rocket blasted into space today 
bearing a usmade telecommunications satellite marking chinas 
debut into the international satellite launching business 
applause broke out in the launch control room after the rockets 
flaming tail disappeared into the black skies over the xichang 
satellite center in southwest chinas sichuan province 
the launch shown live on chinese central television for the 
first time in chinas 20yearold satellite program was delayed 
more than an hour because of bad weather it finally took place at 
930 pm 830 am edt and appeared to go smoothly 
china hopes the successful sendoff of the 2750pound asiasat 
satellite will attract more customers who face long waits for 
launches by western europes ariane consortium and private us 
companies 
china has put 26 satellites of its own in space including at 
least five with long march 3 rockets but the official china daily 
newspaper said that launching the asiasat and other foreign 
satellites would amaze the world 
most foreigners and chinese citizens too think of china as 
the land of the bicycle it wrote they may have to adjust that 
image 
the asiasat satellite was made by the us hughes aircraft co 
and its launch was nearly blocked by a ban on weapons exports to 
china imposed after the june killing of prodemocracy protesters in 
beijing 
but in a conciliatory and controversial move president bush 
waived the ban for it and two other hughes satellites being made 
for an australian company china is to launch them in 1991 and 1992 
sabotage of nearby communications lines also nearly disrupted 
the launch according to a local radio report last month it said 
two men were arrested for allegedly cutting sabotaging or stealing 
communications lines between the launch site and the monitoring 
base 220 miles away in the provincial capital chengdu the 
sabotage occurred from november 1988 through january the report 
said and no motive was given 
the asiasat satellite is on its second trip into space it was 
launched in 1984 as the westar6 but failed to reach its proper 
orbit it was recovered by the us space shuttle and sold to the 
asia satellite telecommunications co ltd a hong kongbased 
consortium with chinese british and hong kong partners 
once in geostationary orbit always staying above the same spot 
on the earths surface it will be used to transmit television 
telephone and other communications signals to asian countries 
burma and two hong kong companies have signed contracts to use it 
and thailand pakistan south korea nepal and other countries have 
signed letters of intent 
it is estimated to have a 10year lifespan

nasa prepared its countdown today 
for launch of the shuttle discovery after replacing a dirty 
television camera lens that will help in the deployment of the 
powerful hubble space telescope 
countdown for tuesdays liftoff was to begin at 3 pm edt an 
hour after the scheduled arrival of discoverys five astronauts 
the 15 billion hubble space telescope will be capable of 
detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater 
clarity than the best groundbased observatory 
it is to orbit 380 miles above earth for 15 years enabling 
astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant that their light 
has been traveling to earth for 14 billion years 
air force weather forecasters today said they expect a 60 
percent chance of favorable weather at launch time the forecast 
was somewhat worse than fridays predictions which calculated the 
chance of good weather at 80 percent because of the expectation of 
strong surface winds 
but nasa test director terry willingham said launch preparations 
are proceeding smoothly 
overnight technicians discovered four faulty connectors on one 
of the shuttles three main engines the cables were removed for 
repair or replacement and the problem should be no impact at all 
on the schedule willingham said 
the launch window for tuesday extends for 2 hours beginning at 
847 am edt it is the longest period of opportunity for launch 
since the challenger mission in 1986 that ended in tragedy 
willingham said 
we want to give ourselves every opportunity to get this launch 
off in the first few days willingham said 
technicians discovered the spotty lens during a routine check 
friday afternoon they removed the television camera from the 
orbiter and replaced the lens within two hours 
mission specialist steven a hawley will use the 50footlong 
robot arm to deploy the telescope on the second day of the fiveday 
mission a spot on the television camera lens might have hampered 
his view 
hawley said he has practiced deploying the 24250pound 
telescope dozens of times and is prepared for just about anything 
that might go wrong 
im confident we can do it under almost any circumstance he 
said nasas real good at whatifs and weve done a lot 
whatifs what if this part doesnt work what if the arm fails 
completely 
mission specialists bruce mccandless ii and kathryn sullivan 
veteran spacewalkers will go out to help remove or fix the 
telescope if necessary 
nasa planned to stop charging the telescopes nickelhydrogen 
batteries today

in the computer studies room 
at maghaberry prison a small clerkish man taps away at a braille 
typewriter preparing a text for the blind 
bobby bates was one of the shankill butchers a protestant 
murder squad whose throatcutting atrocities against roman 
catholics exceeded even northern irelands savage standards 
thirteen years into a life sentence for 10 murders with a 
history of violent behavior behind bars 42yearold basher 
bates comes across as a changed man he works and eats alongside 
catholic prisoners he has discovered christ he makes no excuses 
for his crimes 
the new bobby bates is a product of maghaberry prison which 
opened in 1986 as an alternative lockup for inmates who want to 
leave the paramilitary milieu learn a skill and one day return 
to a peaceful life outside prison 
left behind in the older maze prison outside belfast are the 
truly committed still segregating themselves into republican 
catholic and loyalist protestant cellblocks still refusing to 
work or do anything else that could be read as acknowledging that 
their offenses were criminal not political 
simply by choosing maghaberry instead of the maze a prisoner 
tacitly signals he is removing himself from the battleground and 
rehabilitation can begin 
maghaberry is part of the quiet transformation of northern 
irelands prison system in the decade since the maze seethed with 
protest and 10 inmates led by bobby sands of the irish republican 
army captured world attention by fasting to death 
the government has always seen selfimposed segregation as a 
perpetuation of the conflict between republicans fighting to rid 
northern ireland of british rule and loyalists fighting to 
maintain the union with britain 
attempts to force integration have invariably met resistance 
indeed the one jail where tension persists is belfast prison 
where about 650 pretrial inmates are demanding segregation 
several belfast guards have been beaten in recent months and 
four have been fired prosecuted or suspended since 1983 for 
mistreating prisoners a mass breakout was foiled in october 
since maghaberry opened 164 maze prisoners have gone there by 
choice now two years after it became fully operational it has 
about 275 prisoners and 520 are in the maze 
had bobby bates not moved to maghaberry he probably would have 
stayed in jail for the rest of his life as recommended by the 
judge now he may stand a chance of freedom in the next decade 
the prison service felt confident enough to invite four foreign 
journalists to visit maghaberry and the maze last month and chat in 
private with prisoners the only condition was that no prison 
officials be identified because they are targets for assassination 
i think the government is anxious to get the prisoners out as 
much as anybody else said the rev denis faul a catholic priest 
and human rights campaigner in close contact with prison 
authorities and prisoners families 
there are very many people in prison both from the protestant 
and the catholic side who would not normally be in prison for 
any type of crime other than a politically motivated crime he 
said in an interview 
nearly 2800 people have been killed in northern ireland since 
sectarian violence began in august 1969 the violence has declined 
in recent years 
the number of security offenders sentenced once forecast to 
reach 3000 is about 800 many were jailed 10 years ago or more 
and the government has been persuaded that at least some can be 
freed without risk 
wellbehaved prisoners with release dates are eligible for a 
weeks furlough at summer and christmas some prisoners 
incarcerated in britain have been moved to northern ireland to be 
nearer their families 
most prisoners on fixed sentences can expect onehalf off if 
they behave as opposed to onethird in britain 
four prisoners were learning bricklaying in a maghaberry 
workshop one an ira man serving life for killing a soldier said 
he left the maze because i didnt fancy that environment 
anymore 
he was 34 had served 14 years and expected to be released in 
1992 he went home last summer and at christmas 
i met people my age who are married with kids settled down 
he said the amount of people i didnt know it was like there 
was a gulf between myself and my family 
did he have regrets it was something you got caught up in and 
you thought it was worth it but in retrospect you wouldnt 
have done it 
working beside him was a loyalist doing life for aiding and 
abetting a murder he had a wife and four children all those 
years lost he remarked a life completely wasted 
no such sentiments are expressed at the maze a maximumsecurity 
sprawl of hshaped cellblocks 
republicans and loyalists locked in separate uprights of each 
h never meet or work they have their own gyms exercise yards 
billiard tables and libraries 
why not move to maghaberry because its saying forget your 
republicanism and become part of a criminal system an ira lifer 
said but we are not criminal prisoners we are political 
prisoners 
ira supporters argue that the journalists visit is a propaganda 
exercise that abuses do occur in belfast prison and at police 
interrogation centers 
they maintain britain has no right to be in ireland at all let 
alone to jail people who see themselves as freedom fighters 
we say northern ireland as a concept is illegal and should 
never have been set up said a maze republican on whose cell 
wall hung portraits of che guevara and jesus christ 
conversation kept moving back to 1983 when 38 prisoners escaped 
from the maze in a mass breakout and half were recaptured 
immediately one told a reporter of being beaten and set upon by 
dogs 
the prison service doesnt deny the abuses but says they 
happened in the heat of the immediate aftermath of the breakout 
and that the violence was mutual leaving one prison officer dead 
and several injured it insists abuses could not happen now 
compensation was paid to 19 prisoners who alleged being 
assaulted but no prison official was ever disciplined for the 1983 
incidents 
last month an irish court ruled against extraditing two maze 
escapees believing they might face reprisals 
faul said there had been no serious incident of brutality 
since 1983 in any of northern irelands four prisons 
by and large allowing for the difficulty of imprisoning large 
numbers of men and so on conditions have been excellent faul 
said 
he supported the irish court decision and said the british 
can only blame themselves if they had put the prison officers on 
trial or had dismissed them and could show that to the court then 
the prisoners would have been sent back 
in fauls view whatever improvements are made in the lives of 
northern irelands catholic minority are undermined by the 
nonaccountability of the security forces british army police 
prison officers for killing and illtreating persons 
this he said is one of the major problems thats keeping the 
ira in existence

hillsborough circuit judge richard lazzara said he did not 
believe hospitalization was necessary in light of the insanity 
finding but said ms moritt should remain under psychiatric care 
the hillsborough community college student from hollywood was 
charged with firstdegree murder in the oct 23 drowning of her 
newborn 6pound 9ounce boy if convicted of that charge she 
would automatically have been sent to prison for life with the 
possibility of parole only after 25 years 
dormitory roommates heard a babys cries before finding ms 
moritt in the bathroom covered in blood and rushed her to the 
hospital when they returned to dorm to clean up they found the 
baby stuffed headfirst in the toilet and covered with bloody towels 
and sheets 
defense attorneys argued that ms moritt was temporarily insane 
suffering from a dissociative disorder that left her with no memory 
of being pregnant or even giving birth 
nine psychiatrists and psychologists backed up that defense 
during the trial but prosecutors blasted it all as 
psychobabble 
shes attempting to flee not physically but mentally from 
the scene of the crime assistant state attorney stephen crawford 
told the jury in closing arguments dont let her do it 
the hillsborough circuit court jury declared itself deadlocked 
friday after 16 hours of deliberations but reached agreement after 
another hour behind closed doors today 
ms moritt ignored the advice of her lawyer and stood before the 
judge late friday night to say she wanted jurors to press on 
im prepared to declare a mistrial do you want me to declare 
a mistrial lazzara asked the woman 
no she said bursting into tears 
the judge gave her a chance to compose herself and come back 
but her response was the same 
lazzara warned defense counsel that urging on the weary jury 
could be foolish for his client 
i want to be careful not to hold this jury hostage it could 
backfire on the defendant i want you to know that lazzara told 
defense attorney b anderson mitcham 
never in his 27year legal practice had he advised his client to 
turn down a mistrial mitcham said but he added that he was bound 
to follow the wishes of his client her mother and father 
outside court the defense attorney explained that the stress of 
the twoweek trial was taking a toll on the defendant and her 
family 
she was charged with firstdegree murder she was under the 
care of a psychiatrist and consider the enormous sums of money 
they spent trying to defend this case mitcham said 
ms moritt reportedly rejected numerous plea deals for reduced 
sentences because she did not want to spend even one day in prison

a suspicious fire swept through a ferry 
carrying about 490 people in the north sea before dawn today 
killing at least 75 people and leaving about 75 missing and 
presumed dead authorities said 
the manager of the danish company that operated the 
americanowned ship which was carrying danish and norwegian 
tourists said he believed the tragedy was caused by arsonists who 
set two fires on separate decks 
the dead were found in cabins and on the car deck where many 
people were apparently sleeping in their vehicles on the overnight 
trip from norway to denmark aboard the 10000ton scandinavian 
star officials said 
there was a lot of smoke and flames it looked rather 
horrible helicopter pilot nils martinsson who helped in the 
rescue told swedish radio 
firemen found 75 bodies on the burning vessel said elsebeth 
roalso of the coastal rescue center at sola norway 
seventyfive people were missing and presumed dead said 
christer waldegren spokesman for the swedish sea rescue center at 
goteborg about 340 people were rescued and taken to ports and 
hospitals in norway sweden and denmark more than 20 of them were 
injured 
passenger and crew lists were not immediately available and 
this led to confusion about the numbers and identities of those on 
board officials said 
about 200 passengers were norwegians and the rest were danes 
officials said most were young people families and retirees on a 
weekend trip 
helicopters and boats rescued the survivors from the 465foot 
ship and from life boats early news reports said passengers had 
jumped into the nearfreezing waters but that could not be 
confirmed 
aage danielsen a norwegian rescue vessel captain said the 
missing passengers were believed still on the ferry 
the ship is owned by the miamibased seaescape ltd registered 
in the bahamas and had norwegian officers and a portuguese crew 
officials at seaescape could not immediately be reached for comment 
in miami 
ole hansen managing director of vognmandstruten the danish 
shipping company that operated the ferry was quoted on danish 
radio as saying he was virtually certain the blaze was the result 
of arson hansen said two separate fires broke out on the ship the 
first at about 230 am 
officials gave no immediate details on how the fires may have 
started or what would have motivated someone to set fires that 
would have endangered them too a blaze aboard the ship in 1988 was 
blamed on a leaky oil pipe 
waldegren said the blaze was under control but still burning 12 
hours later he said the ferry was being towed to lysekil sweden 
140 miles southeast of oslo 
the fires broke out in the aft section of the ferry as it sailed 
in the skagerrak strait from oslo to the fredrikshavn in denmark 
the captain reported the first fire as the ferry was about 40 
miles south of the norwegian ferder island in the outer oslo fiord 
or just west of the swedish vaeder islands 
the crew quickly extinguished the fire then discovered a larger 
blaze one deck below reports said 
when we came there was a strong fire in the aft and strong 
smoke developing and then only 30 to 45 minutes later it started 
burning also on the port side martinsson said 
rescued passengers said they heard no fire alarm but were 
awakened by the smell of smoke 
rescuers equipped with smokebreathing apparatus searched the 
ferry for possible survivors according to the coastal rescue 
center at sola near stavanger 180 miles west of oslo 
bettina kold 20 a danish employee in a retail shop on the 
scandinavian star was quoted by ntb as saying her alarm clock woke 
her more than two hours after the fire began she said she could 
not escape through smokefilled corridors and was unable to break 
open her cabin window 
she waited 90 minutes until a rescuer helped her out 
nearby vessels responded to the ferrys distress call 
soviet and west german freighters helped norwegian and swedish 
vessels pull survivors from lifeboats and ferry them to ports in 
sweden norway and denmark 
two tugs poured water into the scandinavian star 
soeren kamp knudsen the frederikshavn police chief told danish 
radio that police would investigate a possible link to previous 
ferry fires in scandinavian waters 
earlier fires include one on the ferry holger danske near oslo 
in september 1988 in which no one was killed in february 1989 two 
crew members were injured in a fire on the king of scandinavia 
between copenhagen and oslo 
ntb said the scandinavian star had been chartered for one week 
on the oslofredrikshavn route by the danish company vognmannsruten 
a fire aboard the ship occurred in march 1988 off cancun 
mexico and was caused by leaking oil in the engine room no one 
was injured 
the us national transportation safety board concluded that 
blaze was caused by inadequate maintenance and it said the ships 
crew lacked training in firefighting procedures

after 10 months as speaker of the house tom 
foleys most noticed accomplishment may be a remarkable 40pound 
weight loss 
shedding the pounds and with it any comparison to former 
speaker tip oneill came more quickly and apparently with greater 
ease than his first major legislative victory passage of a child 
care bill 
foley made the bill one of his top priorities the day he became 
speaker last june but he let it drag on and turn into a test of 
his mettle 
this year he set an endofmarch deadline and met it 
i would say the first quarterly report of the foley leadership 
is going to be a positive one if for no other reason than the 
passage of this bill a top lieutenant rep steny hoyer dmd 
said after the house passed the measure late last month the bill 
provides tax credits and other assistance to parents for child care 
pushing through a clean air bill and campaign reform will pose 
similar tests this year 
when foley became speaker last june after jim wright of texas 
resigned because of an ethics investigation he was warmly greeted 
as a conciliator with the added quality of television presence he 
and his fellow democratic leaders offered a more modern face for 
the congressional majority to counter the republican white houses 
media savvy 
any real measurement of his performance at this point is 
premature house colleagues and outside observers say the initial 
grades are mixed at best 
his ability to win legislation has shown promise but his 
unwillingness to lead or even join in a partisan charge against the 
bush administration is rated a disappointment by many 
foley shrugs off such criticism saying were unwilling to 
simply be an opposition party 
instead of making up his mind and convincing others to join him 
he prods others toward consensus and then hops aboard 
the question mark about foley is whether hes tough enough to 
knock the heads when he has to to make things happen said 
norman ornstein congressional scholar at the american enterprise 
institute a conservative think tank 
some of foleys fellow house democrats say he has shown that 
toughness 
what happened in child care is pretty instructive of whats 
going to happen the rest of the year said rep martin frost 
dtexas a former ally of wright who has become a deputy whip under 
foley 
in the child care battle foley stood aside while democratic 
committee chairmen fought their own turf battles then imposed a 
deadline to force a resolution 
confident he had the votes foley and his leadership team used 
the house rules to limit debate and thereby block any republican 
amendments once they decided on the final bill and made it public 
democrats were able to win its passage within 48 hours 
this was the first time i have seen foley deliberately use the 
muscle of the majority to drive something in an unfair way said 
house minority whip newt gingrich rga 
rep mickey edwards rokla complains that foley has brought a 
return to backroom dealing in which it takes months for the 
democrats to decide what their own position is 
edwards chairman of the republican policy committee said that 
struggling with foley is like fighting cotton candy 
foleys first months as speaker were otherwise without 
significant accomplishment except for passage of a big pay raise 
for congress itself done with the quiet agreement of republicans 
although democrats have a 258176 majority foley was unable to 
stop house passage of president bushs proposed cut in the capital 
gains tax last year 
foley also has been unable to forge a leadership position on a 
social security payroll tax cut proposed by sen daniel p 
moynihan dny similarly he has declined suggestions that the 
savingsandloan bailout be made a partisan issue 
just heating this matter up when there is already some 
misunderstanding about it may not be in the best public interest 
even though it might be somebodys view of a clever political 
ploy he said

minutes after israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir swept out of the grand hotel with his bodyguards in tow a 
robed arab leader was whisked into the suite shamir had just 
vacated 
its a revolving door at the hotel an oasis of opposites in 
washingtons diplomatic and political whirl 
democrats hold fundraisers there republicans too atampt stays 
there as does mci 
and for 2500 a night intransigent foes from the middle east 
also call the grand home 
you wont see greta garbo strolling languidly through the lobby 
as she did in the hotels namesake movie but on a recent march 
morning singer janet jackson went bouncing past the reception desk 
trailed by an entourage laden with luggage 
jackson wasnt the only celebrity 
guillermo ford panamas vice president was holding court in 
the lobby raphael calderon the presidentelect of costa rica was 
on a preinaugural visit to washington and moroccos top military 
generals were in town 
the lobby looked like a parking lot for bodyguards said 
samir darwich the lebaneseborn frencheducated manager 
arabic and spanish drowned out english 
the presidential suite where kings and presidents stay is vast 
a grand piano graces the living room a jacuzzi dominates the 
bathroom and the beds are truly king sized 
darwich says clients are drawn to the 260room hotel by its 
european elegance multilingual staff and unobtrusive service but 
for some of his guests security is the paramount consideration 
we have proven we have the toughest most sophisticated 
security in town he said 
plainclothes guards their identity often unknown to the hotel 
staff mingle with the guests 
it can get crowded because visiting dignitaries also are 
protected by the us secret service 
we tell our security to use their brain not their muscles 
darwich said 
there has never been a clash between the guests or the guards 
although a few close calls have pumped some adrenalin 
there was the time former israeli prime minister shimon peres 
changed course and decided to shake hands with guests in the lobby 
on his way out rather than use the side door to leave the hotel 
several arab officials were in the lobby and the security agents 
were freaking out said one witness 
several months ago israels defense minister yitzhak rabin was 
coming to town and asked to stay at the grand rabin was not 
deterred after being told that a plo official khaled alhassan 
also was staying there a source said 
if the palestinian is concerned let him move out rabin 
reportedly said 
in the end alhassan stayed on the 5th floor rabin on the 9th 
the hotel people did all they could to make sure they wouldnt 
bump into each other said the source 
the hotel staff is used to unexpected events 
on a sunday evening two years ago darwich got a frantic call 
from the state departments protocol office king juan carlos of 
spain was stranded in washington during a refueling stop because of 
mechanical trouble with his jet 
we had 30 minutes to prepare to receive the king and his 
entourage of 70 people they were all hungry darwich said 
the pianist became a busboy one of the owners turned into a 
waiter and darwich carried suitcases 
darwich a practicing moslem does not talk politics with his 
guests nor do the lebanese owners whose chain includes four 
hotels in saudi arabia and one in switzerland 
its pure business for us darwich said 
i dont care what nationality religion color or race he is 
as long as a guest pays the bill hes my boss

did the americans play into fidel castros hands 
by starting tv broadcasts to cuba giving him a credible new 
complaint about us imperialism or has jamming the telecasts 
increased hostility among his people 
judging public opinion in a relatively closed country like cuba 
is a highly speculative undertaking 
cubans would like a more varied tv menu but no one knows for 
sure what they think of the voice of america operation known as tv 
marti for that matter estimates of support for the revolution 
itself after 31 years differ wildly 
like radio marti another voice of america venture tv martis 
purpose is to provide balanced news and entertainment to a country 
where the bush administration says both are in short supply 
there is broad disagreement about how many listeners radio marti 
has after five years one dissident described the audience as 
massive but officials call it trifling 
there are no reliable polls of public sentiment in cuba some 
people wonder whether castro is as oblivious to the public mood as 
were the eastern european leaders ousted by popular uprisings last 
year 
cuban officials insist they have mechanisms that ensure people 
an opportunity to complain publicly without fear 
in the regla section of havana last monday local leaders heard 
dozens of complaints from hundreds of citizens 
gripes were aired about the transportation system and the uneven 
distribution of goods to neighborhood stores similar meetings were 
held this past week all over the island 
how durable is the revolution can castro make viable a system 
that is being reviled in other places that tried it 
a leader of the young communist league on tuesday night 
predicted somewhat extravagantly that his group would still be 
functioning in 28000 years 
two days later a leader of a human rights group predicted no 
less extravagantly that popular discontent resulting from economic 
hardship will bring castro down in less than a year 
whatever the truth castro is going all out to use the tv marti 
issue to rally support 
there is little doubt many cubans agree with him that the 
broadcasts which began march 27 violate national sovereignty 
tv marti castro says is a gross instrument of subversion 
naming the station after the hero of cubas independence struggle 
he says is like an american naming a house of prostitution for 
george washington 
boredom is a constant companion for many cubans however they 
are intensely curious about what kind of programming tv marti would 
bring and are disappointed by the successful jamming effort 
the question is how many are in each camp 
the only known instance of a test albeit limited of public 
sentiment occurred in an east havana neighborhood a year ago the 
results were not encouraging for the government 
a human rights activist roberto bahamonde ran for a municipal 
assembly seat as a proponent of a free press free speech and free 
enterprise heretical views in marxist cuba 
he lost 6030 but there were 59 abstentions in the 
showofhands vote presumably many who abstained were closet 
bahamonde supporters who felt voting for him openly could lead to 
charges of disloyalty 
the establishment candidate gerardo aldama won slightly more 
than 40 percent of the vote virtually the same as president daniel 
ortega of nicaragua in his losing reelection campaign in february 
bahamonde was arrested two weeks after election night and wont 
be free until july the government says his detention is based on 
participation in illegal meetings and on economic crimes rather 
than his political stands

police officers mingled among the lines of 
spectators that crowded the contemporary arts center for todays 
public opening of the photographs of the late robert mapplethorpe 
ive never seen crowds like this at an opening center 
spokeswoman amy bannister said 
when people hear about censorship of art museums they wonder 
where its going to stop she said 
hamilton county authorities sparked controversy in recent days 
by saying they think some of the photographs which depict 
homosexual and erotic themes are criminally obscene but despite 
the police presence at the opening no police action was 
immediately taken against the show which runs through may 26 
a demonstrator at a museum entrance held up a sign reading 
censorship is obscene because of the high number of expected 
spectators the show opened at 9 am an hour earlier than 
scheduled no immediate attendance figures were available 
roger ach president of the centers board of trustees said 
public criticism would not change the museums plans for choosing 
future shows ach said he is encouraged by the public debate about 
art and freedom of expression 
i find myself being a conservative spokesman in a conservative 
community ach said but i believe in art expression and 
freedom of expression 
close to 6000 people lined up friday night and filed through 
the museum to for an advance view of the exhibit in advance of 
todays public opening the exhibit includes nine homoerotic or 
sadomasochistic photos among the 175 on display 
this crowd says a lot about the people of cincinnati and their 
desire to express their freedoms said museum director dennis 
barrie i think it is a vindication of the exhibit 
earlier friday hamilton county municipal judge edward donnellon 
dismissed a lawsuit in which the private museum had sought a 
summary judgment deeming the exhibit art not obscenity 
his ruling appeared to clear the way for prosecutors to step in 
we can do a lot of things im not going to tell you what 
were going to do said hamilton county prosecutor arthur ney jr 
i cant discuss anything that i may could should or might do 
the controversy has revealed two sides of cincinnati a city 
with a lively arts scene and a conservative law enforcement 
establishment whose suppression of pornography is viewed favorably 
by much of the population 
it also revived the dispute over the mapplethorpe exhibit 
canceled in june at the corcoran gallery of art in washington 
dc but shown since in philadelphia chicago hartford conn 
berkeley calif and boston 
the exhibit of the work by mapplethorpe who died of aids in 
march 1989 prompted congress to limit funds for the arts after 
sen jesse helms rnc declared the photographs obscene 
rallies in support of the museum were held all week at the 
downtown plaza a block from the arts center 
antismut campaigners protested friday outside donnellons 
courtroom one held a sign saying jesus is freedom for captives 
of pornography another declared you cant disguise 
pornography and get away with it in cincinnati 
although police were not in evidence at fridays opening fire 
marshals were they ordered the center to let patrons in only one 
of the museums three entrances forcing people to stand outside up 
to an hour in a blocklong line 
members paid 10 apiece to help offset the loss of 300000 the 
arts center suffered because of the controversy over mapplethorpe 
the museum lost that money because directors withdrew from the 
fine arts fund which sponsors and finances various groups in the 
cincinnati area because they feared the community uproar over 
mapplethorpe would block contributions to all arts 
a lot of people have joined just so they could be here 
tonight said bob swaney the museum staffer who prepared the 
mapplethorpe exhibit our membership has risen by about 30 
percent this week 
one caller said i have no interest in seeing this show but 
the sheriff is making me buy a ticket 
the crowd including welldressed older folk and arty types in 
black turtlenecks filed through the gallery until sometime after 
midnight 
warning signs about controversial photos were posted at the 
door and no one under 18 was admitted 
barrie expressed concern about the shows future 
the ruling today was not a setback he said but since the 
matters not in court we dont know where its at 
last month sheriff simon leis jr declared the photographs 
criminally obscene leis as county prosecutor successfully 
prosecuted former hustler magazine publisher larry flynt in the 
1970s 
he and other officials have closed all of the citys adult 
bookstores and bylaws make it illegal for video stores to rent 
xrated material

an animalrights activist decried the removal 
of a pigs heart that was flown on a passenger jet to a medical 
conference in florida 
but the company that transported the heart said it was essential 
for research that could bring down the cost of transplants by 
determining if organs can be shipped on regularly scheduled 
commercial flights rather than chartered planes 
the heart was removed from a pig at presbyterianuniversity 
hospital in pittsburgh and connected to a pump still being 
researched and tested by organetics ltd of minneapolis the heart 
was flown in a special container to fort lauderdale fla in a 
seat aboard a usair flight on friday 
sandra etzel director of animal advocates of pittsburgh called 
the action an absolutely abominable publicity stunt 
i think its terrible theyre going to kill a pig just to sell 
a product etzel said you are not helping to save anyones 
life by killing a pig to demonstrate a fact that you already know 
she said the device which was to be displayed with the heart at 
the 10th annual international society for heart transplantation 
conference has been written about in medical journals 
a company official acknowledged several articles have been 
written about the pump 
but weve never put a heart on a plane said tom jakubowski 
vice president of sales and marketing for the biomedical 
engineering company this is our airborne test its just 
continuing our research 
the pig heart reached its destination without incident 
inflight tests indicated the heart did well during its journey 
and further tests will determine how well it fared while connected 
to the pump jakubowski said today 
the heart will then be disposed of following the conference he 
said 
human donor hearts currently are packed in ice and transported 
on chartered planes which costs 7000 to 8000 an organ shipped 
that way must be transplanted within eight hours after it is 
removed from the donor 
organetics hopes to show that its pump will sustain blood flow 
in a heart for 12 to 15 hours giving doctors time to send the 
organ on a cheaper commercial flight jakubowski said 
it should impact the cost of organ procurement significantly 
if we can get it to the state of using commerical airliners 
jakubowski said of the container the cost of the containers 
ticket for fridays flight was 225

greek voters who cast their ship of state 
adrift 10 months ago are being asked for a third time to finally 
put someone at the helm 
but sundays parliamentary election like those last june and 
november could end without a clear winner and again leave greece 
with a weak coalition unable to cope with a foundering economy and 
a resurgence of terrorism 
the outcome may also have bearing on the countrys four us 
military bases which could be forced to close in november unless a 
new agreement is reached with washington 
the conservative new democracy party which missed a majority by 
about 1 percent of the vote last november believes it can win 
sunday the socialists and communists neither strong enough to win 
alone hold out the hope of forging a leftist coalition 
but after almost a year of indecision and near political 
paralysis opinion polls indicate the likely outcome is continued 
deadlock and new elections prime minister xenophon zolotas 86 a 
former governor of the bank of greece remains caretaker until a 
new government is chosen 
new democracy argues that greeks must make hard choices for hard 
times the choice is simple economic reform or economic ruin says 
71yearold party leader constantine mitsotakis who promises to 
slash public spending and restructure the economy 
this is what is at stake in these elections your wages and 
pensions the bread of your families mitsotakis told his final 
campaign rally friday night 
however his socialist and communist opponents describe his plan 
as a blueprint for wholesale unemployment and severe cuts in 
pensions and government services 
if new democracy needs to increase its vote total only slightly 
sunday it could win a majority in the 300seat single house 
parliament and the right to govern greece first results are 
expected late sunday evening and final results tuesday 
new democracy narrowly missed a majority both in november and in 
june when voters first rejected twoterm premier andreas 
papandreou and his panhellenic socialist movement pasok 
but the charismatic papandreou also 71 continues to be a 
political force despite his indictment on corruption charges 
openheart surgery and an open affair with dimitri liani a former 
airline hostess half his age whom he married after divorcing his 
american wife of 38 years no date has been set for his trial 
papandreous pasok and a communistled alliance which has 
finished third in the last two elections have worked together 
seeking to prevent a conservative victory and to forge their own 
leftist coalition 
the european economic community has warned greece that the 
country is facing bankruptcy and that the common market will not 
bail it out greek economists fear the country might be forced to 
turn to the international monetary fund and institute tough

japanese consumers and news media saturday welcomed 
their governments pledge to the united states to make structural 
economic reforms that could fundamentally change this 
workobsessed thrifty nation 
but some japanese bristled at the strong us pressure behind 
the reform program 
every japanese citizen was hoping that the talks would force 
japan to change its structure said housewife noriko kimura 55 
of yamato a tokyo suburb there is no way around relying on 
pressure from outside 
but the mainichi shimbun daily newspaper said in an editorial 
that japan compromised to appease us demands 
on thursday japan agreed to reforms that included simplifying 
the national distribution system increasing public works spending 
on such things as roads and harbors and promoting shorter working 
hours 
the 32page list of promises which turned out to be more 
comprehensive than many critics had expected was also aimed at 
altering the closeddoor policies that japanese businesses have 
long employed to keep out foreign competition 
the unprecendented agreement came thursday after four rounds of 
talks between us and japanese officials under the structural 
impediments initiative framework the initiative was devised by the 
bush administration last july as a way to alter the underlying 
economic factors that led to the united states 49 billion trade 
deficit with japan in 1989 
in return the united states agreed to try to boost its 
international competitiveness by trying to balance the federal 
budget improving the us educational system and increasing 
incentives for personal savings 
i think it is a good thing if the united states gets japanese 
politicians moving and gets them to change old laws that are no 
longer useful said kumiko tsukamoto a nurse at a large tokyo 
hospital but telling us to raise public works expenses to 10 
percent is going a bit far 
toshiyuki ogura a 25yearold employee of a british chemical 
company said he was ambivalent about the agreement 
i think america is intervening too much in our affairs he 
said but on the other hand these talks are a good chance for 
japanese consumers 
japanese leading economic daily nihon keizai shimbun said the 
economic pressure was inevitable 
as the international borders of economic activities get 
blurred intervention into internal matters to a certain extent and 
changing rules are inevitable the newspaper wrote in its 
saturday edition 
it is wise for japan to accept the us intervention although 
it could be painful the newspaper said

the government ordered farmers in areas 
hit by swine plague to start destroying some 150000 pigs saturday 
in an attempt to wipe out the epidemic 
farmers protested the preventive measure arguing the refunds 
for the loss will not cover the cost of restarting pig farming from 
scratch which could take years 
the measure to destroy all pigs within a halfmile radius of the 
29 plague dens discovered since march 15 affects some 200 pig 
farms refunds for destroyed pigs will total about 169 million 
officials said 
the european community is expected to extend the measure later 
this week by approving the killing of some 380000 more pigs and 
piglets in a wider area costing about 465 million in refunds 
minister for agriculture paul de keersmaeker said the swine 
plague remains out of control in the northern belgian provinces of 
west and east flanders the plague was discovered jan 15 and 
65000 pigs have already been destroyed

a moderate earthquake rattled the san 
francisco bay area during an exhibition baseball rematch between 
the teams that were about to start a world series game at 
candlestick park when last years killer quake struck 
the temblor measuring 45 on the richter scale capped an 
afteroonlong swarm of seismic activity that jangled nerves and 
tossed merchandise from store shelves but caused no major damage or 
injuries 
the quake struck at 739 pm just one minute after the game 
between the oakland athletics and the san francisco giants got 
under way at candlestick 
in the press box everybody sort of sat up and said no that 
didnt happen did someone jump hard said bob egelko an 
associated press reporter covering the game it looked like the 
players hesitated 
it was a spooky reminder of the 71 magnitude earthquake that 
struck northern california on oct 17 killing 67 people and 
causing an estimated 7 billion in damage 
that quake shook candlestick minutes before the start of game 3 
of the world series between the giants and as before a crowd of 
60000 some cracks appeared in the stadium pieces of concrete 
broke off and power was knocked out forcing a nationally 
televised pregame show off the air the game was postponed and the 
series resumed 10 days later 
many of the 23760 fans at fridays game seemed unaware of the 
temblor egelko said giants pitcher russ swan paused for a moment 
on the mound before he resumed pitching the as went on to win the 
game 92 
the quake friday evening was centered in the danville area 
about 20 miles southeast of san francisco said pat jorgenson a 
spokeswoman for the united states geological survey in menlo park 
it was followed by a 35 temblor at 751 pm and a 31 at 759 
pm the usgs recorded a total of 77 earthquakes in the bay area 
between noon and 1030 pm friday including shocks estimated at 
39 and 35 jorgenson said 
she said this morning that while the detailed count of overnight 
tremors was not immediately available nothing significant was 
reported between 1030 pm friday and 9 am today 
a candlestick switchboard operator who felt an afternoon temblor 
recalled i thought oh my god here we go again the giants and 
the as are playing and were getting another earthquake 
the quakes were felt over a wide area but damage was minimal 
said chuck young a spokesman for the office of emergency services 
in sacramento 
were sort of numb said mark scollans assistant manager of 
bills drugs in danville where crews had just finished picking 
spilled merchandise off the floor when the evening quake struck 
were just getting rocked scollans said its all back on 
the floor 
at a convenience store in nearby alamo cashier mahmoud 
hiderzada said hed lost count of the quakes and was waiting for 
the next one 
of course they scared me he said i was here by myself i 
jumped from behind the cash register and went outside i took the 
short way 
the temblors were centered about 9 miles southsoutheast of 
concord near danville probably on the concord fault jorgenson 
said 
april had been designated california earthquake preparedness 
month 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph 
evey increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times 
greater 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter 
scale

nearly two years after residents pledged to clear 
a local park of drug traffickers it remains a drugfree oasis in 
one of houstons toughest neighborhoods 
to me its kind of like sacred ground said police sgt 
richard zajac who heads a unit of undercover drug officers they 
drug dealers dont trespass on it but everything around there is 
fair game 
the cleanup of winzer park once called crack in the box 
because it was so easy to drive up and buy drugs there has been 
hailed by federal drug czar william bennett and president bush as 
an example of communitypolice cooperation both visited the park 
in december 
police started the cleanup in november 1987 gradually 
overcoming the distrust of neighborhood residents to enlist them in 
the campaign 
teacher thelma lastrap 49 joined up after seeing a tv news 
report that portrayed her acres homes neighborhood as a pocket of 
drug abuse 
i thought they dont have drugs in this neighborhood so i 
got in the car and drove around the park recalled mrs lastrap 
now secretary of the group known as acres homes war on drugs as 
i looked at groups of young black men some yelled out my name 
hi mrs lastrap 
see i taught out here for years and they knew me that was 
depressing people were drinking and exchanging packets of drugs 
and money but nobody was using the facilities 
capt david massey who heads the police substation that 
oversees the area said that before the cleanup good people in 
the community hadnt been able to use the park in five years 
today teenagers play basketball in the park which covers 
roughly 10 square blocks until nearly midnight officers use the 
parks baseball diamond to practice after their 11 pm shift ends 
on weekends families barbecue and push their children on swings 
and the park has been renamed for andrew winzer a police officer 
from the neighborhood who spent time with kids at the park and was 
killed in a car accident while on duty 
they aint been selling no more dope said richard gould 
14 a student at aldine junior high and a regular at the basketball 
court its kind of chilled out on all that 
the bottom line is theyve cleaned it up zajac said we 
havent made a case there since ive been here thats a year and 
three months 
but the victory against drugs remains limited to the park 
since the beginning of the year undercover officers have made 
five felony drug busts within three blocks of winzer park 
a barbecue joint a few blocks away and a liquor store in the 
opposite direction are hangouts for middleaged men who drink from 
bottles wrapped in paper bags and allegedly deal crack day and 
night sometimes as early as 5 am to people en route to work 
zajac said 
bloodstains on the basketball court are testament to continued 
troubles in the neighborhood ballplayers said the stains appeared 
after a drug suspect shot another at the liquor store and the 
wounded man ran home through the park dripping blood 
even though the park is still very active i wont say that 
weve totally cleaned up all the drugs said sharon pouncey one 
of four officers assigned to a storefront police squad in the 
neighborhood we still have spots but were working on them 
the storefront officers work with the acres homes group to 
provide tips on drug activity and form friendships the 
organizations membership fluctuates between 200 to 300 with an 
active core of 15 to 20 people said storefront officer vergil 
ratliffe 
i remember the first year we got out here ms pouncey said 
this is the largest black area in the city and they were really 
reluctant to join the police we had to go out and instill that 
trust 
at first the only time they saw officers was for arrests and 
shakedowns now that theyve implemented the neighborhood police 
approach its been a lot different they know us and they tell us 
whats happening

former national security adviser john 
poindexter was convicted today at his irancontra coverup trial of 
all five felony charges against him in the scandal that rocked the 
last two years of the reagan administration 
the jury delivered the verdict on one count of conspiracy two 
counts of obstructing congress and two counts of lying to congress 
the former national security adviser is the highestranking 
reagan administration official to be put on trial in the 
irancontra scandal the former president testified on videotape 
poindexter 53 faces up to 25 years in prison and fines of 
125 million us district court judge harold greene scheduled 
sentencing for june 11 
poindexter made no comment but his attorney richard beckler 
said the verdict would be appealed were going to keep fighting 
it as long as we can 
prosecutor dan webb said the trial team led by lawrence walsh 
would make a recommendation on punishment within the next several 
weeks so far none of the irancontra figures convicted has drawn 
a jail sentence 
in the courtroom poindexter stood grimly facing the jurors as 
25yearold foreman wayne mitchell read the verdicts 
guilty mitchell said as the clerk read each of the five 
criminal charges aloud 
there was silence in the courtroom as the first verdict was 
returned and then a murmur as mitchell continued to read guilty 
verdicts on each of the five counts 
he joins former aide oliver north and another reagan 
administration national security adviser robert mcfarlane as 
officials who stand convicted in irancontra 
the charges stem from efforts by officials in the reagan 
administration to sell weapons to iran and divert some of the 
proceeds to the contra rebels in nicaragua at a time when congress 
had banned such aid poindexter was charged with destroying 
documents and obstructing efforts by members of congress to learn 
details of the affair 
theres no question that even being charitable to admiral 
poindexter he did it because he wanted to protect the political 
viability of ronald reagan and i consider that to be a selfish 
motive webb said outside the courtroom 
asked about reagans sworn deposition in which the president 
said he felt no crimes had been committed in irancontra webb said 
simply president reagan was wrong and incorrect noting the 
earlier conviction of poindexters former aide north 
the white house said president bush would have no comment on the 
verdict 
poindexter was found guilty of charges he concealed from the 
house and senate intelligence committees the us role in a 
november 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
the jury also found him guilty of concealing from the house 
norths military assistance to the contra rebels fighting the 
leftist government of nicaragua 
the former national security adviser did not take the witness 
stand in his own defense during the five week trial jury 
deliberations took six days 
reagan said in his videotaped testimony that he didnt think 
poindexter had made any false statements to congress 
reagan said he had instructed his aides to stay within the law 
in assisting the contras poindexters lawyers asserted that he was 
following reagans instructions at all times 
north delivered damaging testimony against his former boss 
the former white house aide testified that he was reluctant to 
go to a meeting with members of congress about the contras because 
he knew there would be things he could not disclose 
north said he expressed his concerns to poindexter who sent his 
subordinate to the meeting anyway 
north testified that poindexter told him you can handle it 
or you can take care of it 
once there north lied repeatedly telling house intelligence 
committee members he wasnt offering military advice to the rebel 
force 
north also testified that he watched poindexter tear up a 
politically embarrassing presidential document that ratified a nov 
25 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran the document called a 
finding portrayed us involvement in an arrangement to trade arms 
for hostages 
poindexter tore up the document nov 21 1986 hours after 
telling congress that reagan hadnt approved the hawk missile 
shipment 
in fact poindexter had presented the document to reagan who 
signed it dec 5 1985 reagan said in his videotaped testimony he 
couldnt recall when he learned of the hawks shipment and didnt 
recall the finding 
poindexters lawyers countered by emphasizing other aspects of 
norths testimony 
nobody ever told me to lie to congress north said of his 
statements about the contras north insisted that the decision to 
cover up was his own not poindexters 
north at one point started to testify that he might have gotten 
the conversation with poindexter backward north said it may have 
been he rather than poindexter who gave assurances that north 
could handle or take care of the house intelligence 
committee 
greene cut off norths revised testimony saying the subject had 
already been covered in detail the day before 
on the hawks shipment poindexter was accused of lying to 
congress when he said he didnt find out about the delivery until 
five weeks after it occurred and that he hadnt realized other us 
officials might have known about the shipment ahead of time 
prosecutors suggested that poindexter lied so that congress 
wouldnt start inquiring about the presidential document 
the document stated that munitions could be provided to the 
government of iran which was taking steps to facilitate the 
release of the american hostages 
poindexter tore up the document eight days after reagan told the 
nation that we did not trade weapons for hostages 
poindexters defense was that by nov 21 1986 he had only a 
dim memory of the yearearlier hawks shipment 
he told congress he would try to find out details and report 
back 
beckler didnt deny that poindexter had known of the shipment 
earlier than january 1986 but excused it as a misstatement due to 
bad memory 
poindexter supposedly found out at the end of november about 
the hawks shipment rather than in january and that is no big deal 
that is a fiveweek mistake beckler told the jury 
considering all he had to do its not too bad that he only 
missed by five weeks

a west virginia wesleyan college 
fraternity that displayed the confederate flag despite a campus 
moratorium on use of such symbols has been disciplined school 
officials said 
president thomas b courtice on thursday ordered 45member kappa 
alpha to stop recruiting pledges for six months and said the 
fraternitys current pledges cannot become active members 
the penalty came after an incident in which fraternity members 
clad in confederate garb wore 2inch rebel flags on their hats as 
part of old south weekend the fraternitys annual spring 
dance said dusty williams alumni adviser to the group more than 
a dozen black students later protested outside the fraternitys 
offcampus house williams said 
courtice instituted the moratorium last december after students 
and parents complained about the use of confederate symbols 
i think the punishment was quite severe and the members feel 
the same said williams a 1969 wesleyan graduate we dont see 
why the pledge class has been targeted 
in addition to the sanctions kappa alpha was ordered to 
complete a workshop on cultural diversity and sensitivity

americas newspaper editors who always worry 
whether theres a future for the newspaper last week examined what 
the future newspaper might look like 
the editors are concerned because millions of people find 
reading the paper is no longer a daily routine circulation has not 
kept pace with population growth 
our readers are older and every time we print an obituary we 
may be losing a reader says ray jenkins editorial page editor 
of the baltimore evening sun 
analyst leo bogart author of press and public says that while 
the number of us households increased by 41 percent between 1970 
and 1987 daily newspaper circulation increased by less than 1 
percent 
many people read the paper only a day or two a week studies 
show some take it on days grocery store coupons appear some only 
on sunday 
editor dave zweifel of the capital times in madison wis said 
sales of his paper from news racks are up while home delivery is 
down 
that means people are stopping by the newsstand when they feel 
they need a paper zweifel said our readers are telling us 
were not considered necessary 
women particularly have been abandoning newspapers 
the number of women who read the paper four days out of five has 
diminished by 26 percent in five years one study says 
we wondered how and whether we could engage a bright young 
population that increasingly saw newspapers as oldfashioned the 
future of newspapers committee said in a report to the american 
society of newspaper editors 
jenkins says such worries may themselves be old fashioned 
he thinks the era of the printed and delivered newspaper is 
drawing to a close because of the convenience wellknown to young 
people of being able to fish information out of a home computer 
he cites too the environmental impact of publishing a 
newspaper 
one day the public is going to say to us you cant cut down 
1000 acres of trees to deliver one sunday paper any more 
jenkins said 
his is a maverick viewpoint he admits members of the editors 
society still seemed optimistic that the newspaper would survive 
by finding ways to become more useful 
they examined prototype newspapers produced by the future of 
newspapers committee another ambitious study is under way to 
examine the occasional and atrisk reader 
the prototypes suggested what the paper might be in 30 years 
full of color full of graphs and charts highly compartmentalized 
organized indexed with pages labeled and stories colorcoded so 
readers would know at a glance whats in the package 
these papers would be designed to be utilitarian perhaps even 
customized so that subscribers would have the option of taking only 
the sections they want 
they looked like less of a random conglomeration of isolated 
reports on the last 24 hours and more like a groomed selected 
package of information 
restaurant critics would rate rest rooms as well as cuisine 
some stories would be told entirely in pictures or sketches 
the newspaper might also publish a thin quickly read summary 
edition to be sold at supermarket checkout counters to people who 
dont take the regular paper because it is too heavy in both 
senses of that word 
committee member bill southerland executive editor of the 
republican and american of waterbury conn said he drew 
encouragement from the editors newly aroused interest in readers 
he said he expects people will depend on news on paper rather 
than computer screens for the foreseeable future 
they want to scan for the pleasant surprise the story they 
do not know to ask a computer for he said 
but even southerland talks of his wifes time poverty and 
concedes his three children dont find the newspaper vital 
they are aware of whats in the paper he said when i 
call it to their attention 
some editors thought the concern about the vanishing newspaper 
was silly 
were finding a lot of older people are getting back to 
reading theyre fed up on television said harvey jacobs editor 
of the indianapolis news who said he grew up in a house in which 
there were two items on the table the holy bible and the evening 
news 
im bullish on the industry added ted beitchman editor of 
the tribunedemocrat of johnstown pa for the past year in any 
small town the newspaper is just so important to the culture of 
the whole town 
he said when he dropped a cartoon panel of pennsylvania history 
he got 117 postcards in protest when he wrote a prochoice 
editorial on abortion he found 67 pickets outside the papers 
front door 
he didnt relish the protests he says but he sure liked 
knowing what his paper said mattered so much to his townspeople

a chinese rocket lifted a usmade 
telecommunications satellite into space saturday marking the 
nations debut in the international satellite launching business 
applause broke out in the launch control room as the flaming 
tail of the long march 3 rocket disappeared into the nighttime 
skies over the xichang satellite center in southwest chinas 
sichuan province 
the launch was broadcast live on television for the first time 
in chinas 20yearold satellite program chinese central 
television said premier li peng watched the launch from a control 
center in beijing 
attending the launch were about 400 invited guests from around 
the world including many from satellite maker hughes aircraft co 
and us ambassador james lilley 
the rocket lifted into orbit an asiasat telecommunications 
satellite which is owned by the asia satellite telecommunications 
co ltd a hong kongbased consortium with chinese british and 
hong kong partners 
the satellite will be used to transmit television telephone and 
other communications signals to asian countries burma and two hong 
kong companies have signed contracts to use it and other countries 
have signed letters of intent 
i hope that tonights launch is the beginning of a longterm 
chineseamerican collaboration in space and is the basis of a 
continued improvement in the relationship between the peoples of 
our two countries an official from hughes aircraft said he was 
not further identified 
china hopes the successful sendoff of the 2750pound asiasat 
will help improve its image as a backward country and attract other 
customers who face long waits for satellite launches 
most foreigners and chinese citizens too think of china as 
the land of the bicycle the official china daily newspaper 
wrote they may have to adjust that image 
china has launched 26 of its own satellites 
the launch of the asiasat was almost blocked by a us weapons 
ban imposed after chinese troops crushed a prodemocracy 
demonstration in beijing killing at least 500 people 
but in a conciliatory and controversial move president bush 
waived the ban for asiasat and two other hughes satellites that 
china will launch for an australian company in 1991 and 1992 
the asiasat satellite is on its second trip into space it was 
launched in 1984 as the westar6 but failed to reach its proper 
orbit it was recovered by the us space shuttle and then sold to 
the asia satellite telecommunications co 
it is estimated to have a 10year lifespan 
after the launch an official from asia satellite announced that 
the company would donate the use of six of the satellites 24 
transponders to asian broadcasters covering the asian games in 
beijing this september 
the launch is a major breakthrough for china which has been 
trying for several years to enter the world launch market 
western nations have expressed concern that advanced technology 
could be leaked to china during satellite launches while western 
space technology companies have complained that chinas launch 
price of 30 million is artificially kept lower than the fees 
charged by the european ariane consortium or the space shuttle 
in 1988 china signed an agreement with the united states 
promising to safeguard satellite technology from misuse or 
diversion and to launch no more than nine us communications 
satellites over the next six years it also promised to abide by 
market practices in pricing and insurance 
xichang is one of chinas three known launch sites although 
sources say a fourth exists the pad is nestled among green 
mountains sparsely inhabited by peasants of the yi minority who 
evacuate their homes for each launch

has opened an investigation into the 1968 warsaw pact invasion of 
czechoslovakia that crushed a prodemocracy movement a newspaper 
reported saturday 
the probe will clarify all circumstances of a criminal offense 
against peace and identify czechoslovaks responsible for the 
sovietled invasion the daily newspaper slobodne slovo said the 
names of officials who invited the five warsaw pact armies into 
czechoslovakia in august 1968 will be made public 
to identify those people is the main aim of the 
investigation the daily quoted lubomir veleta deputy general 
prosecutor as saying he said the people questioned will include 
vasil bilak a former communist party highranking official who 
resigned all his political posts in december 
bilak 72 a longtime party ideologist was accused by 
czechoslovak human rights activists in a report sent to authorities 
in may 1988 of treason for allegedly helping to prepare the 1968

rumored to be one of a handful of prague communist leaders who 
asked the soviet union to intervene to halt the reform movement 
on aug 2021 1968 600000 troops from the soviet union 
poland bulgaria east germany and hungary crushed the prague

president bush may have won the battle when 
the senate confirmed t timothy ryan jr as top savings and loan 
regulator but democrats also gained 
ryan a labor lawyer with no banking experience was confirmed 
on a 6237 vote as director of the treasury departments office of 
thrift supervision hes expected to be sworn into office monday 
the administration lobbied hard for that result treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady worked the phone for days white house 
lobbyist tom korologos roamed the halls of congress ryan himself 
met with dozens of senators some as late as wednesday morning the 
day of the vote 
the hard work paid off in a widerthanpredicted victory 
seventeen democrats joined all 45 republicans in endorsing ryan 
that left 37 democrats opposed 
democrats acknowledged from the outset that the battle was lost 
yet for six hours leading to the vote they railed against ryan as 
unqualified for the job and at the administration for even thinking 
about sending his name why 
in part because thats what they believed but senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas offered an alternate explanation the 
democrats he said just created an opportunity to say i told you 
so to the president if ryan doesnt work out 
i have a sneaking suspicion that much of this debate is not 
really about tim ryan dole said it may be an exercise in 
political selfprotection and it may be about writing the opening 
chapter in who is really to blame for the savings and loan mess 
the sampl crisis was years in the making and the blame definitely 
rests on both parties and on both the legislative and executive 
branches of government but democrats are frustrated that the mess 
has left president bush and ronald reagan before him politically 
unscathed 
this is especially distressing because of the ethics 
investigation of four democratic senators and one republican who 
received 13 million in campaign contributions from charles h 
keating the man at the center of the nations worst thrift failure 
during his eight years in office reagan never mentioned the 
developing problem bush has barely touched on the subject since 
signing the bailout law eight months ago 
though the congress is unquestionably the one that is writing 
the laws this needs to be shared as well by the president 
said sen bob kerrey dnebin terms of the amount of money we 
are allocating to this bailout president bush deserves to be known 
as the savings and loan president not the education president not 
the clean air president 
slowly but surely thats happening bush has had to put the 
administration solidly behind ryan who will have the thankless job 
of deciding which sampls are strong enough to survive and which must 
surrender to government control 
bush also will be confronting the dilemma of finding more money 
for the problem on friday a report from congressional auditors 
made it clear the need for more dollars will be soon 
charles a bowsher comptroller general of the general 
accounting office increased the agencys estimate of the crisis 
cost from 257 billion to at least 325 billion he said it could 
easily top 400 billion and may hit 500 billion in the economy 
falters 
bushs 1991 budget through various budget gimmickry earmarks 
only 73 billion for sampls recognizing reality as described by the 
gao means bushs budget deficit projection would have to zoom 
the administration seems to have felt the job was done the 
day the bill was signed actually the job just began said rep

this university town voting to declare 
itself a zone of reproductive freedom to preserve abortion 
rights still echoes with the voices of 1960s liberalism 
just say no to capitalism is typical of the occasional 
graffiti on main street aging volkswagen buses painted with 
flowers are at home on the streets 
utility poles are studded with staples used to tack up leaflets 
for the latest cause please save black pond woods begs one 
notice with the reminder please recycle this paper 
on monday voters approved 2to1 a measure that would limit the 
penalty for abortion to 5 the charter provision modeled after 
the citys 5 marijuana ordinance takes effect only if a state or 
federal law bans abortion 
kim lane scheppele an assistant professor of political science 
at michigan calls the abortion measure the municipal equivalent 
of civil disobedience 
the provision which backers believe is unlike any other in the 
nation attracted no organized opposition and its passage surprised 
no one yet the voters also approved raising the marijuana fine 
from 5 to 25 
critics of the abortion measure point out that like the 
marijuana fine it is largely symbolic the michigan court of 
appeals ruled in 1977 that communities may not enforce a city 
provision in place of state law 
scheppele who teaches a seminar on abortion at michigan said a 
conservative strain exists alongside the citys liberalism 
pointing out that it has a republican mayor but she said 
politicians shouldnt dismiss the vote as a symbol of frustrated 
liberalism in a university town 
it does show there is at least some constituency in michigan 
that is going to be very upset if restrictive abortion measures are 
ever passed she said 
ann arbor elects prochoice lawmakers but they are a minority in 
the legislature which has supported a ban on statefunded 
abortions and requiring minors to have parental consent for an 
abortion 
the city of 108000 showed its prochoice leanings in 1988 when 
the issue of banning statefunded abortions for poor women was on 
the ballot it passed easily statewide but lost in ann arbor 
some chafe at the citys liberal image others shrug it off 
its a university town and university towns always do unusual 
things former mayor robert j harris said 
its going to perpetuate that liberal stereotype its trying 
to perpetuate the image that ann arbor is above state law that 
somehow it has placed itself higher than state law complained 
senior mark tullki a member of the conservative coalition ticket 
in the universitys student elections 
paul stebleton a sophomore from maine who is prochoice said 
it was the abortion opponents who are a vocal minority imposing 
their will on others its the rest of the country that is out of 
step with what people really want 
stebleton said politicians shouldnt ignore the ann arbor vote 
i would hope they see us as the future and do take us 
seriously he said the way we vote indicates the course of 
events for the future 
dan calderone a bearded baker with long hair tied back in a red 
bandanna said ann arbor voters may not be out of step with the 
times just more thoughtful 
voters are very sophisticated they understand the issues very 
deeply and are not afraid to voice their opinions and take somewhat 
unpopular stands he said 
calderone is prochoice but didnt vote in mondays election 
i havent voted since richard nixon won in 1972 he said i 
was disillusioned with the whole american political system

nuclear accident will get free vacations extra medical care and a 
whole array of other benefits pravda reported saturday 
more than 100 radiation victims who were denied proper hospital 
care because of a drug and bed shortage began a hunger strike in 
the ukraine last month to demand better treatment the tass news 
agency reported a week ago 
beginning this summer people who worked within 20 miles of the 
chernobyl atomic power plant after its 1986 explosion and fire will 
get lowered rents 
they will also be placed at the front of waiting lists for 
hospitals and better apartments 
tass said president mikhail s gorbachev asked the soviet trade 
union council to ensure that children from contaminated areas spend 
their summer vacations in medical centers and rest homes 
nationwide he told governments to make spaces for these children 
before may 1 and ordered that one sanitarium normally used for 
government officials be turned over to the children 
the moves appeared to answer the hunger strikers main demands 
the soviet government also plans to organize an additional 
medical checkup this year for all the cleanup workers and keep them 
under closer medical supervision in general 
the april 26 1986 fire and explosion at the chernobyl plant 
located in the kiev region of the ukraine killed at least 31 
people radioactive contamination affected millions of acres of 
land and tens of thousands of people were relocated because of the 
poisoned environment 
the weekly moscow news reported in november that more than 250 
people who were working at the plant or helped clean up afterward 
have died 
people affected by radiation will be registered on a single list 
and beginning this year special rehabilitation centers will be 
created for them pravda said 
a soviet lawmaker and environmentalist yuri shcherbak said 
thursday in geneva that he believed it would take 320 billion to 
cope with all the consequences of the chernobyl accident over the 
next 10 years 
the ukrainian parliament has designated april 26 as chernobyl 
tragedy dayand the body voted last month to phase the station 
out of operation over the coming years

the state department has expelled an iraqi 
diplomat at the united nations because of his suspected role in an 
alleged murder plot against two opponents of the baghdad regime 
the diplomat who was not identified was ousted for an abuse 
of his privileges of residence in the united states a department 
spokeswoman anita stockman said saturday she said the diplomat 
left on thursday 
given the nature of the diplomats actions it would be 
inappropriate for the government of iraq to take any retaliatory 
action the spokeswoman said 
she said the department could not provide no more specific 
information except to confirm that the expulsion was linked to an 
investigation in california 
we cannot comment on that case since it is currently under 
investigation she said 
but a us official asking not to be named said the diplomat 
helped plan the alleged plot 
a federal grand jury in sacramento on friday indicted a former 
employee of the mission for allegedly participating in an iraqi 
plot to kill two foes of the iraqi government in the united states 
andri khoshaba 47 of the central california city of modesto 
was indicted on two counts of interstate travel to further the 
alleged murderforhire plot khoshaba is a former employee of 
iraqs mission to the united nations 
us attorney david levi said khoshaba an iraqiamerican was 
promised 50000 for his role in the plot which the fbi disrupted 
by detaining him briefly 
a spokesman for iraqs un mission in new york said friday he 
had no knowledge of khoshabas recent activities 
levi refused to identify the targets of the plot but said they 
were not part of any countrys mission to the united nations and 
that they were not us officials 
they were people opposing the iraqi regime in this country 
he said one of the targets was living in the united states 
the modesto bee reported that the targets of the assassination 
plot were sargon dadesho a leader of the assyrian community in 
californias central valley and an unidentified kurdish leader 
whose photograph khoshaba was carrying when he was detained by the 
fbi the bee got its information from dadesho and unnamed sources 
close to the investigation 
a federal warrant has been issued for khoshabas arrest levi 
said he remains at large 
a spokesman for the iraqis un mission who would not give his 
name said khoshaba was working with the former permanent 
representative at his residence as a janitor 
his job was terminated one year ago and from that time we 
dont know anything about him the spokesman said 
levi said khoshaba worked as a driver 
the us attorney said khoshaba traveled to new york city twice 
this year to meet with an iraqi government agent he returned to 
modesto after each trip levi said

a southeastern trailways bus was damaged by 
objects thrown or fired from an interstate overpass in the latest 
violent incident since greyhound drivers and maintenance workers 
went on strike five weeks ago 
none of the 25 passengers or two drivers on the bus was injured 
in the incident at 10 pm friday on interstate 74 at fairland 
about 20 miles east of indianapolis 
greyhound lines inc claims there have been 26 incidents of 
shooting at buses not counting fridays incident since 6300 
drivers and 3000 maintenance workers went on strike against 
greyhound and its affiliates on march 1 
greyhound spokesman steve scarpino said the southeastern 
trailways bus had no connection to greyhound greyhound did not 
have a driver on that bus it was not our bus and it was not our 
route he said 
though indianapolisbased southeastern trailways is a separate 
company from greyhound some of its buses travel greyhound routes 
under a cooperative arrangement unlike fridays incident the two 
other attacks reported on southeastern trailways buses since the 
strike began including one march 31 in which a driver was 
seriously wounded occurred while those buses were going on 
greyhound routes 
state police sgt robert cooley said fridays incident was being 
investigated as a possible shooting the driver went under an 
overpass and he heard a blast and the shotgun pellets he thought 
hit the windshield cooley said 
but the bus company said a senior driver on the bus who was 
training the man at the wheel thought there was no sign of 
shooting the impact would appear to be from rocks ball bearings 
or some other similar objects said dispatcher norma largent 
ms largent said the windshield and destination sign glass on 
the bus were broken in 11 places all the size of a silver dollar 
greyhound has offered 100000 rewards leading to the arrests of 
people who fire on its buses scarpino said the company had not yet 
decided whether to offer the reward in the case of fridays 
incident 
weve got to know exactly what the facts are before we make 
other decisions he said 
greyhound has demanded one week of nonviolence before its 
bargainers will agree to resume negotiations 
we wont be intimidated and neither will our customers 
gravley said 
jeff nelson a spokesman for the amalgamated council of 
greyhound local unions said the incident was unfortunate but he 
criticized greyhounds stance that negotiations will not resume 
until violence has stopped 
we believe that thats a shame that the company is allowing a 
few crackpots around the country to determine whether or not they 
will finally come to the negotiating table he said 
the bus drivers union has disavowed any involvement in the 
violence and cites incidents in which drivers have been injured a 
picket in redding calif was killed when he was crushed by a bus 
driven by a replacement driver authorities ruled it an accident

the crimes

this has ruined my life said bruno 
bruno said he became involved with the totos daughter 
elizabeth in 1982 he also grew close to mrs toto looking on her

after another boyfriend of elizabeth failed three times to kill 
toto bruno was enlisted

automatic handgun to the back of totos head as he slept and 
squeezed the trigger toto still carries the slug in the back of 
his skull 
im definitely a different person bruno said ive 
matured a lot

civilians and wounded 45 others in a bombing raid on the red sea 
port of massawa ethiopian rebels said saturday 
fridays raid was the second attack on the port by sovietbuilt 
jet fighters in three days the eritrean peoples liberation front 
said in a report sent to the associated press in nairobi 
the rebels previously reported aerial attacks on massawa and the 
town of afabet on tuesday and wednesday they said 46 civilians 
were killed and 82 wounded in those raids 
the reports could not be confirmed independently and the 
government has not mentioned any air raids but a handful of 
reporters allowed into eritrea in recent weeks have reported 
previous air and artillery attacks on massawa 
in all three attacks last week the rebels said the air force 
targeted civilian centers with cluster and demolition bombs 
israel has been accused of supplying the government of president 
mengistu haile mariam with cluster bombs a charge denied by both 
ethiopia and israel 
a cluster bomb contains dozens of smaller bomblets that hurl 
shrapnel over a wide area they are particularly effective against 
massed troop formations 
massawa is one of only two ports on ethiopias red sea coast it 
was captured by the rebels on feb 11 three days after they 
launched a new offensive across much of ethiopias northernmost 
province

it took scarcely a minute amid the hubbub of a 
late afternoon house committee meeting to insert the unassuming 
amendment into the clean air bill 
it meant the world to a bearded slightly offbeat chemist at the 
university of denver 1600 miles away 
but in the days that followed it would bring chills to some 
environmentalists local air pollution control officials and the 
environmental protection agency 
the provision now part of the massive and complex clean air 
bill approved last week by the energy and commerce committee calls 
on states to require as part of pollution control plans in scores 
of cities use of a portable automobile pollution detection device 
similar to a radar gun that pinpoints speeders 
the requirement is not in a senate version of the bill which 
passed 8911 last week its not known if the amendment will 
survive future congressional action 
the mobile pollution sensor is the invention of chemistry 
professor donald stedman who has been working on the project for 
14 years and has had a prototype ready since early 1987 
until now few people have been seriously interested in the 
sensor 
its been a terrific struggle weve been going from month to 
month to keep my group together he said in an interview 
anytime im not teaching im telling people about this 
one of those who learned of stedmans device was rep joe 
barton rtexas who sponsored the amendment requiring the devices 
as part of air pollution cleanup programs 
barton called it a commonsense solution and a 
costeffective way to identify the worst polluting automobiles 
known as a friend of oil interests barton sees the device as a 
better way to combat air pollution by getting the dirtiest cars 
off the road than in requiring clean fuels including 
alternatives to gasoline or tougher exhaust controls 
stedman also has done little to ingratiate himself with denver 
area pollution control officials as he admits by arguing his 
invention would be a much better way to combat smog than the 
mandatory testing and oxygenated fuels program now in use in the 
area 
denver is among the most pollutionplagued cities in the nation 
stedman said as many as several thousand of the devices 
costing about 50000 apiece might eventually be in use 
to test vehicles adequately a city such as denver would require 
five of the mobile sensors a state such as illinois about 20 and 
in california youre talking between 50 and 100 he says 
none of the sensors has been produced commercially although 
stedman said several companies have become interested he and the 
university which holds the patent would get percentages 
but bartons amendment has not been received enthusiastically 
everywhere 
the day after it was approved the epa sent a memo to all its 
regional offices saying that while stedmans invention may have 
some merit and is being evaluated much work needs to be done 
before remote sensing is a viable tool in air pollution control 
richard wilson director of the epas office of mobile sources 
expressed concern to barton that use of the devices was being made 
mandatory arguing such a move was premature considering the 
unanswered questions surrounding use of the device 
among the concerns are that the device for the time being 
anyway is capable of detecting only carbon monoxide emissions and 
not other chemicals that contribute significantly to smog 
emission results also could change significantly depending on 
where the sensor is located and how a vehicle is being driven 
making enforcement of violations difficult critics maintain 
this hasnt been tested and its premature to make it a 
mandatory requirement in the clean air act said bill becker the 
washington representative for state air pollution control officials 
the coalition for safer cleaner vehicles a washingtonbased 
consumer and environmental group also raised concerns about making 
such devices mandatory saying it brings up questions of fairness 
and due process 
it seems very unfair to test someone at a random stop where 
they may be pressing on the gas pedal hard or their car might be 
cold and not quite warmed up said gary huggins the groups 
executive director 
stedman insists those problems can be worked out during a 
recent visit to washington to demonstrate his device he was 
ecstatic about the lift given his longtime project by the barton 
amendment 
the two men had not known each other previously barton learned 
of stedmans sensor from a letter the professor had published in 
the wall street journal 
after the requirement was put into the clean air legislation 
interest suddenly jumped stedman said two very nice 
gentlemen in two very nice suits from a fairly large company came 
to visit me the next day saying wed really like to talk to you 
about this

while progress on cutting nuclear weapons is 
slow too slow probably to sign an accord at the summit in late 
may the united states and soviet union are beginning to lay the 
groundwork for a future europe free of cold war tensions 
the tempo is being set by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
whose concept of a single europe would supersede the nosetonose 
confrontation of the north atlantic treaty organization and the 
warsaw pact and it picked up speed at the latest round of 
ussoviet talks here 
while president bush is in no mood to scuttle nato and in 
fact insists on membership for a unified germany he has accepted 
the idea of a 35nation european summit meeting later in the year 
where proposals for europes future would be exchanged for months 
the president has proclaimed his vision for europe whole and 
free 
bushs approval of a 35nation summit this year depends on 
having a treaty to reduce troops tanks and other nonnuclear 
weapons in shape to sign at the gathering and that is nearly as 
much in doubt as completing a framework for a strategic missile 
reduction accord for bush and gorbachev to sign at their washington 
summit beginning may 30 
but secretary of state james a baker iii in threedays of 
talks with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze showed 
interest in constructing new arrangements with new missions for 
nato and the warsaw pact back in december in a speech in berlin 
he called for a new architecture after 40 years of cold war 
before wrapping up three days of talks in washington last week 
shevardnadze offered some suggestions 
they included setting up an alleuropean council and a 
riskreduction center the council members would be the heads of 
the 35 nations including the united states and canada that signed 
the 1975 helsinki agreement to reduce eastwest tensions they 
would meet annually and their foreign ministers more frequently 
to discuss security problems 
baker in december proposed keeping nato in business but giving 
it some new assigments such as overseeing troop reductions and 
refereeing conflicts in other regions he said on friday he was 
open to new ideas provided nato stays in business 
since the process is new the ideas are just now taking shape 
but they are bound to multiply if east and west keep moving closer 
together 
baker and shevardnadze managed to take a cooperative approach in 
their talks despite tensions in the baltics between the kremlin and 
independenceminded lithuanians latvians and estonians 
a blowup could send the drive for a new europe into reverse 
of course i would be disturbed if i thought conflict might 
erupt bush said at a windup news conference friday 
but otherwise he will go to the soviet union for another round 
with shevardnadze in midmay that produce ideas for a new europe 
even as they grope for a framework for a strategic weapons 
reduction treaty 
the two sides failed in the washington talks to overcome several 
obstacles to a nuclear accord among the problems are the limits to 
be imposed on cruise missiles and devising a formula to monitor 
weapons reductions 
taking into account it is in seven weeks yuri nazarkin the 
soviet chief strategic arms negotiator said thursday of the 
summit it is impractical to expect it is going to be signed 
already us and soviet officials are considering the 
possibility of a second bushgorbachev summit later in the year to 
sign the treaty if it is ready by then 
on a new look for europe however the picture is brighter 
shevardnadze withdrew the longstanding soviet demand that 
germany once it is reunified be neutral that helped the 
discussion even though baker continued to insist that the merged 
country be a member of nato 
shevardnadze rejected the us demand as unacceptable he 
recalled how germany overran its neighbors including the soviet 
union in world war ii 
but he said i have no doubt that in the time remaining it is 
possible to find mutual acceptable solutions 
the bush administration considers german membership in nato the 
best insurance against aggression by germany again shevardnadze 
said his government is seeking a solution to this very acute and 
very difficult question 
however the problem is resolved a united germany would be at 
the center of the new europe american troops on the continent 
would be limited to 225000 and the soviets could have only a 
maximum of 195000 outside its borders

a man was arrested saturday on murder and 
attempted murder charges accused of spiking cocacola with an 
outlawed rat poison that killed a neighbor and crippled two 
children in 1988 authorities said 
george trepal 41 was arrested without incident at his sebring 
home and charged with one count of murder six counts of attempted 
murder and several product tampering charges 
the fbi said the october 1988 poisonings of the carr family of 
alturas was the nations only known case of deliberate thallium 
poisoning 
trepal was a neighbor of the carrs when family members ingested 
the outlawed rat killer from an eightpack of 16ounce soda bottles 
at their home said lynne breidenbach a polk county sheriffs 
spokeswoman 
there was a definite motive but were not at liberty to 
discuss it because the investigation is in its infancy she said 
she added that the arrest was based on a sealed grand jury 
indictment returned thursday 
peggy carr 41 was placed on life support and died march 3 
1989 her son duane dubberly 16 and stepson travis carr 16 were 
left paralyzed by the poison 
mrs carrs husband parearlyn carr and three others also 
absorbed traces of the chemical but did not become ill carr 
contacted saturday by the associated press said he had no comment 
on the arrest 
trepal also was charged with seven counts of poisoning food or 
water and one count of tampering with a consumer product he was 
held in the polk county jail without bond 
health investigators determined within six weeks of the 
poisoning that a deliberate act of tampering was involved and ruled 
out the tampa bottling plant and the soda distribution system as 
the source of the thallium sulfate which has been banned for 
general use since 1965 
tests performed by the fbi on three unopened bottles showed the 
crimped metal caps had been removed and replaced and traces of the 
toxic pesticide were found inside 
based on the amount of thallium found in the residue in the 
empty bottles a state epidemiologist estimated each bottle 
contained about a half gram of thallium one gram is considered a 
fatal dose for humans 
thallium sulfate can be found in the form of a crystal powder or 
a paste which dissolves in water 
investigators from the fbi food and drug administration polk 
county sheriffs office and state attorneys office were involved 
in the case

the countdown began saturday for 
space shuttle discovery and its launch of the 15 billion hubble 
space telescope the observatory astronomers hope will solve some 
basic mysteries of space and time 
countdown for tuesdays liftoff began on time at 3 pm edt an 
hour after the five astronauts arrived 
its been a long time happening and now its really here 
said discoverys commander air force col loren j shriver this 
is the end of a fairly long wait but i think in the case of 
this payload the hubble space telescope its well worth the 
wait 
were very very anxious to get it up there and get it into 
operation mission specialist bruce mccandless ii told a small 
crowd of reporters photographers and astronaut family members 
air force spokesman ken warren said forecasters expected a 90 
percent chance of favorable weather for a tuesday launch with a 10 
percent chance of strong surface winds that could delay the launch 
after arriving from johnson space center in houston the 
astronauts were driven to the launch pad to view the hubble space 
telescope which they are to deploy on the second day of the 
fiveday mission it is the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever 
built by nasa and has endured seven years of delay because of 
technical problems and the 1986 challenger explosion 
the space agency finished charging the telescopes 
nickelhydrogen batteries saturday afternoon technicians then 
began a final sweep of the shuttles payload bay removing the 
battery chargers and any remaining protective coverings the 
payload bay doors were to be closed early sunday 
technicians also repaired a shuttle engine cable and replaced a 
damaged connector that was discovered late friday 
because the telescopes nickelhydrogen batteries must be 
recharged in a week nasa plans to halt launch attempts for eight 
days if discovery does not lift off by friday the batteries will 
power the telescope from the time it is disconnected from the 
shuttles power system during deployment until its two 
energycollecting solar panels take over in space 
nasa has up to six hours to launch discovery starting from 847 
am tuesday but the space agency limits the crews time in an 
orbiter before launch to slightly more than five hours to prevent 
fatigue so that the launch window would be shorter if a 
problem developed after the crew went into the shuttle 
it is the longest period of opportunity for launch since the 
1986 challenger mission said terry willingham nasa test director 
we want to give ourselves every opportunity to get this launch 
off in the first few days willingham said 
the telescope once deployed is to orbit 380 miles above earth 
for 15 years it will be capable of detecting objects 50 times 
fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best 
groundbased observatory 
astronomers expect to study stars and galaxies so distant that 
their light has been traveling to earth for 14 billion years 
in addition to shriver and mccandless the crew includes marine 
col charles f bolden jr the pilot and mission specialists

the united states and the worlds six other leading 
industrial powers expressed worry saturday about the steep slide of 
the japanese yen and its impact on the global economy 
us treasury secretary nicholas brady and other finance chiefs 
wrapped up daylong talks at the french finance ministry by pledging 
to keep developments in the exchange markets under review 
however no major action was announced to support the yen 
the ministers reaffirmed their commitment to economic policy 
coordination including cooperation in exchange markets the 
ministers said in a final statement 
the officials of the group of seven nations britain canada 
france west germany italy and japan in addition to the united 
states met against the backdrop of turmoil in the japanese 
financial markets 
in recent weeks the dollar soared to a threeyear high against 
the yen although it firmed in the last few days on uncertainty 
about the outcome of the finance ministers meeting 
a stronger dollar threatens to worsen the united states already 
large trade deficit with japan it makes japanese imports less 
expensive for american consumers and us products more expensive 
for foreign buyers 
japanese officials had sought help from their economic partners 
in strengthening the yen against the dollar 
after the meeting finance minister ryutaro hashimoto of japan 
said the group of seven countries would like to see a stronger yen 
there is no country which said the yens recent levels 
accurately reflect japans economic fundamentals he said 
hashimoto and yasushi mieno japans central bank president 
expressed confidence they had pledges from the other nations to 
keep the currency from slipping further we didnt do this to let 
the yen fall hashimoto said of the ministers statement 
i dont want to indicate to you that means there were promises 
made brady said 
he said the yen was trading at about 154 to the dollar three 
years ago and ended last week at about 157 to the dollar so 
thats more stable than one could have thought he said 
to help bolster the yen governments can intervene in the 
financial markets by selling dollars to buy the japanese unit the 
nations central banks earlier in the year intervened heavily to 
try to brake the rise in the dollar 
asked if more invention is planned to bolster the yen finance 
minister theo waigel of west germany replied you know what 
happened in the past i cant say anymore 
he said the groups official communique recognizes that 
coordination and cooperation will continue and nothing more can be 
added 
the statement said the ministers talked about developments in 
global financial markets especially the decline of the yen against 
other currencies and its undesirable consequences for the global 
adjustment process and agreed to keep these developments under 
review 
the nations also said overall growth remains good with 
strong investment providing a major stimulus to their economies 
and inflation remains contained 
they urged however continued vigilance of inflation rates 
john major britains chancellor of the exchequer said there 
was no express pressure for increases in interest rates and 
no great concern about inflationary prospects in the seven 
nations 
governments raise interest rates to dampen consumer demand and 
ease inflationary pressures 
the ministers also discussed west germanys plans to create an 
economic and monetary union with east germany this summer they 
said the merger could contribute to improved global growth 
they also welcomed the economic reforms under way in eastern 
european countries from central planning to freemarket systems 
this was the first formal meeting of year of the group of seven 
officials they will gather again next month in washington

owners of older model cars who want to add 
rearseat shoulder straps will find that the safety modification 
can be expensive 
kits including shoulder belts cost from 50 to 150 and 
installation could run from 125 to 250 or more manufacturers and 
dealers say 
attention was drawn last week to the limitations of having only 
lap belts in the rear seats of automobiles when ford motor co 
agreed to pay 6 million to a california couple 
ford is paying the record amount to jim and patricia miller of 
san diego calif one of their 11yearold twin sons died in a 1988 
headon collision and the other was paralyzed both were secured in 
the back seat of a 1986 ford escort by laponly belts 
the car company has not acknowledged that the lack of shoulder 
belts figured in the highspeed headon collision but the 
noshoulderbelt issue is the basis for a growing number of 
lawsuits against auto manufacturers 
national highway traffic safety administration spokesman tim 
hurd said the likelihood of a rearseat passenger being killed in 
an accident is reduced by 31 percent with a lap belt and 42 percent 
with a lap and shoulder belt 
cars beginning with the 1990 model are required to have 
rearseat shoulder restraints and the requirement will be extended 
to minivans in 1992 
but auto safety advocates say only a few thousand of the 120 
million pre1990 models have the additional protection 
its like the labors of hercules to get a rearseat shoulder 
belt system installed said clarence ditlow head of the 
nonprofit center for auto safety 
ditlow said that with an increase in lawsuits and with 
outofcourt settlements soaring into the millions of dollars 
manufacturers ought to push the retrofit systems and make them 
cheaper 
the center has been campaigning for years to get automakers to 
issue recalls for shoulder strap additions something that could 
cost manufacturers hundreds of millions of dollars 
european cars have had shoulder belts in four seats for years 
but most japanese cars have no better record than us vehicles 
said ditlow 
checks with several washington area auto dealers on installation 
of a set of rearseat shoulder restraints in an older car brought a 
variety of responses 
one mechanic said he didnt think they were available at all 
quotes on installation charges ranged up to 270 for a set the 
cost of the belts themselves ranged up to 78 each 
one dealer said it would take a week to 10 days to get a set on 
order another said i wouldnt even begin to tell you how much 
it would cost without seeing the car 
any car built since 1972 was required by law to contain special 
anchors for the rear shoulder belts but it has taken the 
government 18 years since then to require the belts themselves on 
new models 
the national transportation safety board has strongly advocated 
their installation in front and rear seats since it investigated 
200 crashes in 1986 and concluded that laponly belts were not only 
insufficient but sometimes hazardous 
the board recommended that manufacturers provide retrofit 
assemblies to convert laponly belts to lapshoulder systems and 
make installation of them as simple and inexpensive as possible 
ford chrysler and general motors all have now established what 
the board considers acceptable programs for making the shoulder 
belts available said board spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
chrysler spokesman tom houston said it plans to have the straps 
in its minivans a year ahead of the 1992 requirement and retrofits 
are available for most older models one drawback is that they only 
come in black while regular seat belts usually match the cars 
interior 
gm spokesman john anderson said the company makes 90 different 
retrofit kits for over 50 models 
the company however has supplied ntsb with a list of 16 models 
for which kits are not available for some models gm said its 
engineers concluded that a laponly belt is safer because a 
shoulder belt would provide no additional protection and could 
cause the occupant to slide under the lap belt last december the 
safety board accepted the companys conclusions 
the safety board and the transportation department have asked 
automakers to provide customers with information on belts for 
individual cars

novelist mario vargas llosa appeared to be the 
frontrunner in sundays presidential election but another 
political neophyte may force him into a runoff in this country 
plagued by rebel attacks and soaring inflation 
besieged by a savage decadelong leftist insurgency and 
impoverished by hyperinflation running at 2000 percent annually 
peruvians have grown distrustful of politicians promises of easy 
solutions 
the countrys 10 million voters are to elect a new congress and 
choose a successor to populist president alan garcia who is 
ineligible for reelection to a consecutive fiveyear term 
leftist rebels have launched numerous attacks aimed at scaring 
voters away from the polls and have threatened more action sunday 
the countrys 80000man police force and army units are on alert 
to protect voters and candidates against attacks by the maoist 
shining path guerrillas 
six candidates for congress were assassinated across peru in 
recent weeks more than 18000 people have been killed as a result 
of the 10yearold insurgency the governnment says half the 
country is under emergency rule because of the rebels 
public opinion polls indicate support for vargas llosa has been 
dropping fast in recent weeks as voters have begun to see him as 
just another politician 
vargas llosa 54 running on a freemarket platform is still 
the leading presidential contender in the field of nine candidates 
but an 11thhour surge by political newcomer alberto fujimori the 
son of japanese immigrants has dimmed vargas llosas chances for a 
firstround victory 
fujimori 51 was a political unknown as recently as a month 
ago his meteoric rise in the past two weeks has stunned political 
analysts and public opinion survey firms 
polls open at 8 am edt and close at 3 pm voting is required 
by law unofficial results are expected sunday night but official 
returns will not be available for weeks 
as late as february voter support for vargas llosa was above 50 
percent sufficient to avoid a runoff but analysts say an 
aggressive campaign by the ruling leftofcenter aprista party has 
created fear in voters about the social cost of the severe 
austerity measures vargas llosa proposes 
vargas llosa despite being a political independent also has 
been tainted by the support he has received in his twoyear 
campaign from traditional politicians discredited in past 
governments pollsters say 
surveys made as recently as a week ago show vargas llosa falling 
to around 35 percent of voter support fujimori an agricultural 
engineer running on an independent ticket has leaped into second 
place with 24 percent of voter preference 
if vargas llosa falls short of a majority he will be forced 
into a runoff most likely in early june 
and if his vote total is significantly less than 50 percent his 
centerright democratic front coalition also could fall short of 
majority control in the 60seat senate and the 180seat chamber of 
deputies 
that would make it difficult for him to impose the radical 
reforms he is seeking 
we have been observing a tendency first in lima and then in 
the provinces that is so strong that it has disconcerted 
pollsters said manuel saavedra director of the peruvian company 
for market research 
analysts say fujimoris success is a reflection of the 
alienation of peruvian voters who feel loyalty to no party and are 
looking for miraculous painless solutions to the countrys crisis 
peruvians are in search of a savior said manuel torrado 
president of datum a market research firm 
in the closing days of his campaign vargas llosa responded to 
the attacks against him by his opponents the heaviest criticism 
came from the aprista partys candidate luis alva castro 48 who 
was favored to win a runoff spot against the novelist until 
fujimoris lastminute surge 
in his last television appearance friday night before a midnight 
ban on campaigning the novelist accused the garcia government of 
using all its resources to deceive humble people about what i 
desire for peru 
they say for example that i defend the rich and that if i 
reach the presidency i will forget the poor that is not true my 
fellow countrymen i dont owe anything to the rich of this 
country 
i have left literature and entered politics because i believe 
that through freedom this country can be changed so that people 
are assured work and food 
vargas llosa is seeking a strong mandate from the electorate to 
put into practice an economic shock program his program includes 
removal of price controls reduction in import restrictions sale 
of moneylosing state enterprises and elimination of tens of 
thousands of jobs from the bloated bureaucracy 
vargas llosa bestknown as the author of aunt julia and the 
scriptwriter among other novels entered the political arena in 
1987 after organizing a huge demonstration against garcias plan to 
nationalize the banks

soldiers shot and killed three people and 
imposed an indefinite curfew on katmandu saturday after the 
bloodiest riots in more than a century in this himalayan kingdom 
it was reportedly the first time that a curfew has been imposed 
in nepal 
the government said 10 people were killed and 107 injured during 
fridays demonstration but witnesses said 300 people may have been 
killed when police opened fire on 200000 prodemocracy protesters 
police shot at the demonstrators who are demanding a multiparty 
system after they set government buildings afire put up burning 
barricades and then marched toward the palace 
it was one of the worst killings ever since the kot

children those who most need protection 
from the law often become its victims legal experts said saturday 
the bitter fact is that the status of children in america has 
deteriorated over the past several decades us court of appeals 
judge patricia wald told about 400 lawyers judges and other 
professionals in the opening session of lawyers for children in 
the 1990s 
the conference on childrens legal rights was aimed at promoting 
what one lawyer called the practice of pediatric law 
the conference organized by the harvard law school children and 
family rights project was a nutsandbolts examination of what 
lawyers could and should do to help societys children 
according to howard davidson an american bar association director 
specializing in childrens issues 
the courts that children are involved with are often the worst 
in the system davidson said in an interview they should be 
the best 
unlike bankruptcy proceedings for example when theres time to 
examine every nuance of a case a juvenile court judge is lucky 
if he can put five minutes in to say whats this all about he 
said weve misplaced our priorities 
if juvenile courts were open to the public if people knew how 
resourcepoor how overwhelmed the system was i would hope they 
wouldnt stand for it davidson said 
the conferences panel discussions were more than an opportunity 
to trade horror stories about the system 
rather davidson said the goal was to provide practical 
knowledge for lawyers who represent children or who could volunteer 
to represent children through pro bono work services provided for 
free 
we want to be to children what pediatrics are to doctors he 
said 
one way of helping children is through guardian ad litem 
programs in which children in both abuse and juvenile delinquency 
cases are represented by an attorney davidson said 
another is by providing more services for victims of domestic 
violence said conference chairwoman sarah m buel a thirdyear 
harvard law student 
buel a 12year veteran of battered women programs rattled off 
survey after survey indicating a link between juvenile crime and 
violence in the home she called for more intervention to protect 
women and their children 
a 1986 study by the hazelton foundation found that 63 percent of 
all boys and young men age 11 to 20 who had committed murder had 
killed the person battering their mother buel said 
theyve taken on the role that weve failed to do she said 
buel was herself a battered wife a single mother and former 
welfare recipient who survived through a social service network 
after putting herself through undergraduate school she is now 
completing her law degree and hopes to specialize in family law 
she decried the small amount of time many law schools devote to 
teaching the legal rights of children compared with the 15 
courses on advanced taxes and services as for harvard we have 
nothing we have family law court thats all she said 
the need for legal volunteers to keep track of children caught 
up in the fostercase system was stressed in a panel discussion by 
louisville ky district court judge tom mcdonald 
he cited the case of eugene a baby born blind and with 
cerebral palsy to a teenage mother he was placed in foster care 
at one year of age weighing 17 pounds when eugene was 10 the 
state finally got around to checking on his condition and removed 
him from the foster home he still weighed 17 pounds mcdonald said 
our law used to pretend that there was a benevolent aspect of 
society constantly working to improve the lot of these children 
wald told the conference now at least we admit that is not 
always so

to a small band of mohawk indians living in 
the forest around miner lake their territory is a sovereign nation 
totally independent of the united states and new york state 
the mohawks at miner lake are at a standoff with state troopers 
who have had them surrounded since march 30 when a vermont 
national guard helicopter on a medical emergency mission was forced 
down after it was struck by gunfire that caused minor wounds to a 
doctor on board 
troopers have vowed to investigate the shots they think came 
from the indian land the mohawks say theyll die for their 
sovereignty they have investigated they say and turned up 
nothing 
continuing negotiations have gone nowhere offers made by the 
indians to allow police on the land have been rejected so far by 
the state as too narrow and limiting for their investigation 
things are pretty much the same as they have been state 
police lt donald romanchuk said saturday 
the mohawks are righteous viewing their community as perhaps 
the last frontier for the traditional mohawk way of life 
isolated behind barricades though resourceful mohawks have 
sometimes resorted to the 1990 method of getting their message out 
by fax machine 
the mohawk people have never relinquished their land they 
have never given up being a people as independent as possible 
said their spokesman darryl martin in order to survive and not 
be assimilated into western culture we keep this law alive today 
those in the community known as ganienkeh do not care what 
judges governors or state troopers in the united states say about 
the complicated issue of indian tribal sovereignty 
sovereignty is not something somebody can give you said 
martin sovereignty comes from the people we are not waiting for 
some commission somewhere to decide whether we are sovereign we 
are sovereign 
we respect the laws of the united states when we travel on 
that land as guests our laws apply here 
new york officials cite acts of congress giving them criminal 
jurisdiction over the indian lands as justification for their 
investigation of the helicopter shooting the indians cite 
treaties the state also has sued the indians to try to close a 
bingo hall that opened in 1988 
a lawyer representing the indians dennis curtin called the 
ganienkeh residents fundamentalist mohawks 
theyre trying to preserve their culture their language 
their heritage their environment he said 
when you look at the rest of society theirs is one to be 
looked up to said curtin who insists that fears of bloodshed at 
ganienkeh are legitimate absolutely every one of them is willing 
to die for sovereignty 
the ganienkeh mohawks first set up their traditional settlement 
by takig over state land around moss lake 150 miles to the 
southwest in 1974 the moss lake occupation erupted into violence 
the same year when gunfire from the encampment wounded a man and a 
9yearold girl passing by in separate cars the mohawks said they 
had been fired upon first 
in a response similar to the present situation outside miner 
lake state troopers set up roadblocks around moss lake in an armed 
standoff that lasted more than three years no arrests were ever 
made in connection with the shootings 
it was at moss lake that gov mario cuomo learned firsthand how 
important sovereignty is to these mohawks then new yorks 
secretary of state cuomo negotiated an end to the tense situation 
by persuading the mohawks to move to their present community near 
the canadian border 
its a complicated thing because the indians regard themselves 
as a sovereignty cuomo said they had never dealt with 
anything under a sovereignty they are a nation and they will deal 
only with a nation 
cuomo finally gained credibility with the mohawk negotiators by 
persuading the fbi to deputize a state police official qualifying 
him as a federal representative in the eyes of the traditionalist 
mohawks 
it took us weeks and weeks to figure that simple thing out 
but it is very important to the indians because it involves their 
understanding of themselves said cuomo they see themselves as 
a nation 
fifty miles to the west at the st regis akwasasne reservation 
the pros and cons of sovereignty has divided the 4000 mohawks who 
live there 
seth shapiro the lawyer defending kakwirakeron in a federal 
court trial on charges he led armed defiance of a state police raid 
on casinos at the st regis mohawk reservation tried 
unsuccessfully to apply the helsinki accord to the indians 
there is an absolute parallel to what is going on with 
lithuania and the soviet union shapiro said we believe in 
sovereignty with lithuania for all these other places we say 
sovereignty is important but not when it comes to our native 
americans they just want to be left alone

radicals stormed out of a communist meeting in 
latvia saturday after fellow delegates refused to declare the party 
independent from moscow in lithuania hundreds of thousands of 
people held a defiant proindependence rally 
the two events underscored the different pace at which the 
neighboring baltic republics are moving as their residents clash 
over attempts to restore the independence lost in 1940 with their 
forced incorporation into the soviet union 
lithuanias parliament like the republic as a whole dominated 
by ethnic lithuanians declared independence march 11 
latvian proindependence politicians have been unable to go as 
far as those in lithuania because the indigenous population 
comprises only 54 percent of the republics 27 million population 
russians make up about 33 percent byelorussians 5 percent and 
poles and ukraines 3 percent each 
about 270 delegates most of them ethnic latvians walked out of 
a party congress on its second day after a draft platform that 
would have established an autonomous latvian communist party was 
voted down a journalist reported 
alex grigoriev an editor of a grassroots political groups 
newspaper said by telephone from the latvian capital riga that a 
majority of the 800 or so delegates felt the platform would have 
gone too far toward independence the platform stopped short of a 
complete break from the moscowbased national communist party 
the delegates who stormed out of the session had favored a more 
radical platform that would have formally split the 177000member 
latvian party from moscow but they supported another version 
calling for autonomy preserving some ties with moscow grigoriev 
explained that version which was voted down apparently had the 
support of the republics leadership and the kremlin the 
journalist said 
he said the walkout was included in a live broadcast of the 
session on staterun latvian television which he was monitoring 
after they left the radical delegates met separately in the 
same building where the congress was held the political education 
house and planned another session of their own april 14 to form a 
separate party 
late saturday lithuanian radio reported the delegates formed a 
committee to try to break the deadlock but it was not clear what 
action congress would take next 
in the lithuanian capital vilnius a crowd official media 
estimated at 300000 massed for the largest proindependence rally 
since the republics parliament voted march 11 to secede from the 
soviet union escalating a clash of wills with the kremlin 
the size of the rally held in a park called into question the 
kremlins emphasis on what it claims is widespread opposition in 
lithuania to independence antiindependence rallies in vilnius 
have attracted only 50000 to 100000 residents lithuanias 
population is 38 million 
military helicopters showered leaflets on saturdays 
demonstration which followed weeks tension between the republic 
and the kremlin which sent troops to take over several vilnius 
buildings and arrest lithuanian army deserters 
the leaflets quoted president mikhail s gorbachevs criticism 
of the independence drive and some bore caricatures of lithuanian 
president vytautas landsbergis elona rukene of lithuanian radio 
said in a telephone interview 
landsbergis spoke to the crowd about the leaflets as they rained 
down 
for 70 years theyve been littering the whole world and 
lithuania but their end is clear their pamphlets and they 
themselves will end up on the trash heap of history the 
lithuanian leader said according to eduardas potashinskas of 
lithuanian television 
the soviet government has barred western journalists from 
lithuania 
landsbergis told the crowd that lithuanians would never revoke 
their pledge to be independent and a message to gorbachev was 
adopted defending the decision to secede and calling the appeal 
popular diplomacy paving the way toward friendly relations with 
the kremlin 
in another development the official soviet news agency tass 
reported that the lithuanian government told local authorities to 
end support services to military draft boards and called on the 
republics youth to refuse service in the army an army official in 
moscow told tass the actions were illegal

a college student who claimed she didnt 
remember being pregnant or giving birth was found innocent by 
reason of insanity saturday in the drowning of her newborn in a 
dormitory toilet 
claire hilary moritt 18 of hollywood burst into tears of joy 
and hugged her attorneys when the jury returned its verdict after 
nearly 17 hours of deliberations over three days 
i knew from gut instinct i knew i wasnt guilty said the 
woman who insisted the jury keep trying for a verdict when it 
twice declared itself hopelessly deadlocked i couldnt go 
through it again 
ms moritt who would have faced life in prison if convicted of 
firstdegree murder was ordered by circuit judge richard lazzara 
to continue psychiatric care in her hometown for as long as is 
necessary 
ill never be able to put this behind me she told 
reporters but im definitely going back to college i want 
to study law and be able to help other people 
the hillsborough community college student was charged with 
drowning the 6pound 9ounce boy only minutes after giving birth 
in her highrise dormitory on oct 23 
roommates heard a babys cries before they found ms moritt in 
the bathroom covered in blood and took her to the hospital when 
they returned they found the baby stuffed headfirst in the 
commode wrapped in bloody towels and sheets 
nine mental health experts testified for the defense that ms 
moritt suffered from a dissociative disorder in which she detatched 
herself from her pregnancy and everything to do with it 
they testified in the twoweek trial that she was out of touch 
with reality and couldnt have known right from wrong at the time 
although many firstdegree murder defendants have tried the 
temporary insanity defense in hillsborough county ms moritt is 
the first to win a acquittal in 14 years 
one of the reasons the defense hasnt been successful is that 
few people have the courage to do what claire moritt did said 
defense attorney paul jeske noting that she consistently rejected 
plea offers on lesser charges that would have meant as little as 
one year in jail 
by going to trial she was risking a minimum of 25 years of

some see them as invaders others consider 
them economic saviors but nearly everyone agrees this tiny 
appalachian town wont be the same with the arrival of 183 college 
freshmen from japan 
i think there was some negative thinking and fear said 
mayor donna stewart but i think a lot of that went away after we 
learned something about japanese culture and met some other 
students from japan 
the biggest thing i think is going to be patience on both 
sides 
sixty students fresh from japanese high schools arrived 
saturday at salemteikyo university created in july in a merger of 
salem college and japans teikyo university the rest of the 
japanese are due later this week 
the students who looked tired and bewildered after their 
2hour ride from pittsburgh aboard a chartered bus said they were 
surprised by their new surroundings 
im happy to be here said yoshikawa wataru 19 of tokyo 
the spaces are so wideopen here and its cold temperatures in 
west virginia were in the 30s and 40s saturday 
akemi matsumoto 18 of tokyo said she was a bit disappointed 
that there were no shops or department stores in this town of 2700 
about 140 miles southwest of pittsburgh 
i was very surprised that there werent any shops she said 
i didnt know it would be so wide open but its very nice 
this is matsumotos second trip to the united states she was in 
this country for a month two years ago 
im here to study american business my first purpose is to 
learn to speak better english and i want to make many friends in 
america matsumoto said 
classes in a new yearround schedule begin april 23 
i think our students will be very happy at salem said jungi 
ikawa the students campus adviser its close to new york and 
washington dc but set in a backtotheland atmosphere 
in japan the colleges are crowded and noisy said ikawa 
this is the opposite it is very quiet here and the hills are 
beautiful the students can see nature and even animals right on 
campus 
teikyo with 26000 students in japan and branches in britain 
and the netherlands last month announced a similar merger with 
westmar college in le mars iowa classes at teikyo westmar 
university begin this fall 
the university also operates a pacific studies program with 
regis college near denver other japanese plans include a twoyear 
college in maryland and a 250 million school near washington 
dc for us and japanese students 
many educators welcome the growing japanese investment in us 
higher education such mergers give japanese institutions 
international prestige and provide the us colleges in some 
cases get muchneeded capital 
before the merger salem college was struggling with 400 
students and no endowment on a campus designed for 1200 teikyo 
paid off the colleges debts and boosted salaries an average 27 
percent with a 12 million investment 
teikyo which set up a 75 million endowment and will award 
400000 in annual scholarships to appalachian students owns the 
101yearold schools grounds and plant leasing it back to the 
school 
the school expects to spend 40 million to 60 million on 
improvements equipment and staff an enrollment of 500 american 
students and 500 japanese students is planned by 1995 
americans will be required to attend two semesters each school 
year and japanese three at a cost of about 5000 a semester 
asian studies will be stressed for americans and intensive english 
courses for the japanese 
the people who attend salemteikyo will be among the leaders 
in business and politics someday in their respective countries 
said salemteikyo president ronald e ohl they will understand 
each other and operate from a global viewpoint instead of the 
narrow selfinterest we see so much of today 
most changes on campus have been cosmetic but real changes will 
be evident when japanese and american live and learn sidebyside 
said senior thad davis president of the student administration at 
salemteikyo 
some students are worried that things are going to get tougher 
academically said davis 24 right now a lot feel the 
american students arent being treated equally theyre using the 
money to fix up dorms and the grounds for the japanese those 
things should have been done in prior years 
ohl said some students may be unable to adapt to the changes 
ultimately a couple years down the road the only people who 
will be here are those who want this kind of program ohl said

few privileges are more sacrosanct in the gay 
community than the right to decide for oneself when and whether to 
tell friends family coworkers or even strangers im a 
homosexual 
but the aids epidemic has produced a new generation of militant 
gays who believe not only that every homosexual should come out of 
the closet but that those public figures who refuse should be 
kicked out and the door locked behind them 
this new philosophy has given rise to a debate and a new verb 
whether to out or not to out a person and under what 
circumstances 
public figures dont have a right to privacy says ann 
northrop a gay youth counselor in new york and a member of the 
militant aids coalition to unleash power known as actup they 
certainly have a right to privacy about what particular sex acts 
they perform but in terms of sexual orientation no i dont 
believe they have a right to privacy 
gabriel rotello editor of outweek a new york magazine 
devoted to making the world more hospitable to homosexuals said it 
is not his position that all gay public figures be forced out yet 
we were the ones who planted the germ of the idea that maybe 
this might be an appropriate thing to start thinking about 
rotello said 
his magazine has gained notoriety for gleefully pushing famous 
people to the edge of the closet and leaving them clinging by their 
fingernails outweek has published deliberately provocative 
columns features letters and for two issues a list called 
peekaboo which was just the names of of prominent people 
readers could draw their own conclusions 
last month outweek published a piece purporting to prove 
that a prominent new york businessman was gay accompanying the 
feature was an editorial rationalizing that the outing was for 
the benefit of gay and lesbian youth who need role models 
but some gay political activists just say no to the whole 
question 
we will not make the decision for anybody public figure or 
private citizen to bring them out of the closet no matter what 
theyre doing in public life said urvashi vaid executive 
director of the national gay and lesbian task force in washington 
timothy mcfeeley executive director of the human rights 
campaign fund a gay lobbying group agreed 
on a more philosophical level i object to the practice 
because i think what our movement really is about is privacy and 
allowing people a certain area of privacy even if theyre public 
figures he said 
somewhere in the middle is thomas stoddard a lawyer and 
executive director of the lambda legal defense and education fund 
in new york he said he can envision circumstances under which it 
might be justified to out someone 
i would suggest that tug of war can be best resolved through 
what one might call a nexus test a test of jobconnectedness 
stoddard said if sexual orientation is related in some fashion 
to job performance or evaluation of job performance then that 
issue is an appropriate subject of public discussion or 
disclosure 
in recent months gay activists have held protests to shame 
elected officials by charging that they werent doing enough to 
combat acquired immune deficiency syndrome even though they 
themselves were alleged to be homosexual 
last march for example about 3000 members of actup stormed 
new yorks city hall to demand more money and care for people with 
aids some demonstrators wore placards ridiculing thenmayor edward 
i kochs assertion that he is heterosexual 
kochs sexual preferences were the subject of rumor from his 
first run for mayor as an unmarried congressman in 1977 at that 
time koch refused to answer questions on the subject saying that 
any answer would indicate that sexual preference should be an issue 
at the same time he was accompanied by former miss america bess 
myerson at campaign stops and seemed to be actively cultivating 
gossip that the city might have a first lady if he was elected 
then last year koch unexpectedly proclaimed his heterosexuality 
on a radio talk show during his failed bid for a fourth term 
by raising the issue himself koch signaled it was ok to discuss 
the subject of his sexuality according to stoddard 
up until that point it seems to me the subject of his sexual 
orientation ought to have been offbounds because it did not relate 
to job performance or public character stoddard said 
so when does it relate 
rep barney frank dmass one of two openly gay us 
congressmen and the only one who came out voluntarily says 
hypocrisy is the test for any public personality 
i think you have a right to privacy but not hypocrisy he 
said in an interview anybody who is himself x or does x and 
then uses x against other people ought to be exposed as a 
hypocrite 
but frank stopped short of so doing last june 
that was when the republican party circulated a memo falsely 
implying that house speaker tom foley dwash was gay frank 
threatened to blow the cover of truly homosexual gop congressmen 
and most washingtonians believed his list would be accurate 
however the gaybashing stopped and frank kept his counsel 
asked if he would feel compelled now to out a colleague who 
for example voted for legislation to exclude homosexuals from 
basic civil rights protection frank said no 
this is an option not an obligation he said adding 
however that forcing some out under those circumstances would be 
justified 
robert bauman a former maryland congressman who lost his seat 
in 1980 after being arrested for soliciting sex with a teenage 
boy said he could see no justification for pushing anybody out of 
the closet 
if hypocrisy was a justification for exposure everybody in 
public life would be dragged out into the streets and pilloried 
for something said bauman who was an outspoken conservative while 
in congress 
it would be better if everyone voluntarily decided to identify 
themselves in their own circles or publicly if that was 
appropriate he said because then everyone would see the 
extent of gay and lesbian presence in america and the world

a canadian who won a new trial on his 
conviction for trying to export metals used in nuclear weapons to 
pakistan in 1986 pleaded guilty to lesser charges rather than face 
another trial 
arshad z pervez formerly of toronto was released after being 
sentenced in the new case to 32 months in prison time he has 
already served assistant us attorney amy kurland said saturday 
pervez pleaded guilty wednesday to attempting to export 
beryllium a material crucial to nuclear weapons production in 
return prosecutors dropped charges of conspiracy and making false 
statements to the government she said 
pervez a native of pakistan who became a canadian citizen was 
to be arraigned wednesday on a new indictment but surprised 
prosecutors with his plea ms kurland said pervez said he planned 
to return to canada 
his attorney jeffrey miller did not return telephone calls 
saturday 
kurland said pervez contacted carpenter technology corp in 
reading in late 1986 to ask about purchasing maraging 350 steel 
a highstrength nickeliron alloy that is used to build nuclear 
weapons 
a carpenter official who knew that the import of the metal to 
pakistan was restricted became suspicious and contacted the 
government 
under federal law the commerce department must license such 
metal shipments because pakistan has refused to sign an 
international nuclear nonproliferation treaty ms kurland said 
pervez was required to show that the metals would not be put to 
military use in pakistan but the government alleged that pervez 
intended to ship the metals to a retired pakistani general named 
inam ulhaq 
ulhaq also was indicted with pervez and still faces arrest in 
this country ms kurland said 
us customs agents posing as a carpenter employee and commerce 
department officials arranged for pervez to buy an export license 
and then arrested him when he paid 1000 for the license 
although pervez claimed he was entrapped by the government he 
was convicted in 1987 of attempted exportation of beryllium 
conspiracy and making false statements to the government he was 
sentenced to five years in prison 
he was acquitted of bribery interstate travel in aid of 
racketeering and illegally trying to get a license to export 
maraging 350 
a 1988 us supreme court ruling changed federal entrapment 
laws and in march 1989 the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
granted pervez a new trial on the charges of conspiracy and attempt 
to export beryllium 
us district judge james giles then granted a new trial on the 
charges of making false statements and a superseding indictment 
similar to the original was returned in march

conservatives and the opposition intensified 
efforts saturday to form the countrys first noncommunist 
government before april 15 with both sides declaring readiness to 
discuss personnel and policy issues 
martin kirchner general secretary of the conservative christian 
democratic union again claimed a coalition could be formed by 
thursday even without the leftleaning social democrats they are 
the countrys second biggest party 
the coalition talks began late saturday afternoon at the house 
of parliamentarians in east berlin kirchner and social democratic 
leader markus meckel said beforehand they were prepared to discuss 
division of cabinet posts and the policy line of the new goverment 
kirchner said the new government would have about 22 portfolios 
and that names of future ministers and policy matters were expected 
to be discussed at saturdays third round of talks 
earlier in the day meckel said a new government must be formed 
quickly but that coalition talks may have to continue after easter 
with the conservative forces 
meckel also told a news conference that the party wants to be 
informed of plans for a state treaty under discussion in bonn to 
set the rules for unifying the two german states 
he called on the east german christian democrats who won the 
march 18 election to use its contacts in west germany to obtain a 
copy of the plans to help the future government prepare its 
policies 
the social democrats on friday had charged the christian 
democrats with failing to present position papers at earlier 
coalition talks meckel said at the time he doubted that a broad 
coalition government could be formed by easter 
the christian democrats responded by saying the conservative 
alliance it leads would be able to form a coalition government and 
gain a majority in parliament with east germanys centrist parties 
they said they would not necessarily need the social democrats 
however such a move would not provide the twothirds majority 
needed for decisions on quick unification with west germany which 
the conservatives want 
the christian democratic union is part of a conservative 
alliance that also includes democratic awakening and the german 
social union 
meckel said saturday after a meeting of his partys leadership 
that it supported continuing the coalition talks 
all efforts should be made to create a government quickly if 
possible before easter or april 15 meckel said 
he said however that if the no agreement on a coalition could 
be reached before the holiday more talks after easter are 
possible 
lothar de maiziere who heads the conservative alliance was 
charged thursday by the countrys first freely elected parliament 
to form a new government

survivors of a fire on a north sea ferry 
said saturday that alarms didnt work and an apparently untrained 
crew didnt always speak the same language aggravating the 
disaster that killed about 150 people 
it took a very long time to get the lifeboats out then nobody 
knew how to get them down said eli kvale nielsen describing how 
her lifeboat hung suspended over the north sea still attached to 
the burning ferry the scandinavian star we were hanging there 
with smoke coming out 
we went on board a death trap said greta holen of norway 
another of about 340 survivors it was pure luck that i 
survived 
survivors and rescuers told stories of confusion during one of 
scandinavias worst sea disasters passengers trying to reach the 
open decks lost their way in narrow smoky corridors and died 
there some were asphyxiated in their cabins 
tom brokopp a doctor at uddevalla hospital near lysekil 
quoted several passengers as saying alarms didnt work and crew 
members had trouble understanding each other 
it was chaotic neilsen said it was clear that the crew 
was not trained for this kind of situation 
news reports said the bahamianregistered ferry had a mixed 
portuguese and filipino crew with norwegian officers and that the 
crew had joined the vessel within the past two weeks 
when the fire broke out some passengers were still awake but 
many were asleep in cabins 
we woke up in the middle of the night i heard a noise 
outside i went out of the cabin and saw thick black smoke said 
danish passenger leo odeland an oslo resident traveling with his 
wife and two daughters 
nothing happened when i pushed the fire alarm i hadnt heard 
the alarm go off at another place where there was supposed to be 
an alarm nothing was there 
odeland said the crew was apparently new and untrained 
it was hard to get the lifeboat into the water and then the 
motor didnt start he said adding that the lifeboat drifted 
away and a soviet freighter picked them up 
bettina kold 20 a danish employee in the ferrys dutyfree 
shop said her alarm clock woke her at 445 am according to 
rescuers the scandinavian star radioed a distress call at 230 am 
kold said she smelled smoke but heard no fire alarm she found 
it impossible to enter the smokefilled corridor and waited in her 
cabin for 90 minutes until a rescuer arrived 
there were plenty of people aboard and i guess they all tried 
to leave at the same time said norwegian fireman svenjohan 
svenson in the heavy smoke it would be easy to take a wrong 
turn people would panic in those narrow corridors 
some of those who got left behind and died just didnt find 
their way out 
neither the fire alarm nor the loudspeaker worked said 
passenger elisabeth skeiro

houses 100 inmates refused to return to their cells

outside the prison said a small number of people were injured but 
he gave no details 
he said 103 prisoners were believed to have taken control of one 
wing and about five hooded prisoners were on the roof prisoners 
also had control of the roof of another wing 
may said prison officers had received intelligence there would 
be trouble this weekend but he did not say what measures were 
taken to prevent it 
prison officers association head john bartell said a search of 
the prison had turned up a hoard of weapons and some prisoners had 
been transferred 
extra staff was brought in from nearby prisons to restore order 
and police were standing by on the perimeter a prison spokeswoman 
said no escapes were reported and the seized wing had been sealed

in other ways 
but he said authorities still hoped to negotiate an end to the 
impasse

ryan white the pale gaunt teenager who 
won a lengthy legal battle to attend public school learned a hard 
lesson about fear but taught the public a more important lesson 
about his deadly disease aids 
this kid is unbelievably important to us surgeon general 
antonia novello said in a telephone interview last week from 
washington 
hes the kid who was able to communicate with adults as well 
as children hes a spokesperson for the whole aids crisis 
novello said he was able to fight alone the stigmatization of 
the disease 
white was hospitalized march 29 with an aidsrelated respiratory 
infection at riley hospital for children where he remained sedated 
in critical but stable condition on a ventilator saturday 
we look for optimistic trends his physician dr martin 
kleiman said saturday we have not seen enough change to change 
his status 
white contracted aids in 1984 at age 13 from a bloodclotting 
agent used to treat his hemophilia 
hes shown us the disease is purely a disease and has no 
social implications kleiman said last week 
white gained national attention in 1985 after he was barred from 
attending western middle school near kokomo because of his aids 
his family sued the case was in and out of courts other families 
petitioned to keep white out of school but white finally won 
personally i would rather have given it up a long time ago 
whites mother jeanne said during the court battle it would 
have been a lot easier on me and a lot easier on the rest of the 
family 
but believe it or not ryan has always really loved school 
ryans sister andrea says boy i wish it would be me that could 
stay home but this is what ryan wants to do and i want what he 
wants 
mrs white moved her family to cicero about 20 miles from their 
home saying they did not want to stay where they were unwanted 
white said at the time that he did not want to die in kokomo or to 
be buried there they were welcomed by the new community and the 
school system 
the battle provided the impetus for the first revision of 
indianas communicable disease law since its original draft in 
1948 and gave many americans a person with aids to identify with 
hes young white and middleclass said eric engstrom 
executive director of the national aids network many people 
could see themselves in ryan ryan understood that and worked to 
educate people and raise awareness hes been an incredible 
catalyst for acknowledgement of the aids crisis 
dr woodrow myers state health commissioner during whites 
battle to attend school and now health commissioner for new york 
city said white answered a call for leadership 
america saw in living color what its like to be the victim of 
unnecessary unwarranted fear myers said it also saw someone 
who endured that struggle with bravery and with his head held high 
and with a spirit of determination that ive found rare 
a national educational and fundraising program to fight 
misconceptions about children carrying the aids virus was named in 
whites honor 
i came face to face with death at 13 years old but decided 
to live a normal life he testified before the white house aids 
commission 
he was on the cover of people magazine his story was dramatized 
in an abc television movie the ryan white story in which he 
played a cameo role 
while white was unconcious in his hospital bed last week 
thousands of people called the hospital to offer support 
president bush planted a tree during a ceremony here while 
visiting the city on a political trip and dedicated the tree to 
white saying let it be ryans tree singer elton john kept a 
vigil with the family and distributed 500 worth of toys to other 
patients 
sen edward kennedy dmass called mrs white after a senate 
committee unanimously approved his bill providing 600 million in 
emergency funds for aids care this ones for you ryan 
kennedy said 
the rev jesse jackson visited white saturday accompanied by 
singers willie nelson and kris kristofferson who were in 
indianapolis for the farm aid iv benefit concert 
other calls have come from vice president dan quayle and 
entertainers michael jackson phil donahue carol burnett and 
lionel richie 
the centers for disease control in atlanta said 125000 aids 
cases had been reported through february and 76031 people had died 
from complications related to the disease 
the cdc estimated 1 million people in the us carry the virus 
what makes ryan white special 
through him we learned that education of the public is 
possible novello said and for everyone out there who learns 
to hate someone out there learns to care because of ryan

earrings probably wont become de rigueur 
among the ranks of portlands finest but policemen wishing to 
adorn their ears with dainty pieces of precious metal may now do so 
the city attorneys office has advised the police to allow male 
officers to wear earrings after a policeman filed a labor grievance 
recently 
the office got involved because of a grievance filed by an 
officer whose name is being withheld said stan peters president 
of the portland police association said 
the grievance challenged rules on proper attire that specified 
female officers must wear small nondangling earrings but didnt 
really address the question of ear decorations for males 
police officials say theyll follow the city attorneys advice 
but they dont have to like it 
i dont think the public is prepared to see a male police 
officer wear an earring said capt wayne inman but i do see a 
shift in public attitudes to allow police officers to mirror 
societys dress code

california will require aspirin makers to warn 
women against taking the drug in the late stages of pregnancy a 
state science panel has decided 
the panel on friday classified aspirin a reproductive toxin 
under proposition 65 the landmark toxics initiative law that 
requires public warnings for substances that pose a risk of cancer 
or birth defects 
the warnings probably on aspirin labels must appear within 
one year after a substance is formally listed in keeping with the 
panels decision 
in making its recommendation the panel rejected a 500000 
report prepared by the aspirin industry that report said it found 
no evidence that aspirin taken in the last three months of 
pregnancy could cause excessive bleeding during delivery and other 
pregnancy complications 
the panel unanimously ruled that such risks have been shown 
based on studies involving high aspirin dosage 
but panel members also acknowledged recent studies that aspirin 
in very low doses half a tablet or less may relieve certain 
medical problems suffered by pregnant women 
they said the aspirin warning should be qualified to advise 
women against taking aspirin in the last three months of pregnancy 
unless directed to do so by your doctor 
aspirin products have carried a general warning label since 1982 
and certain overthecounter aspirin substitutes also carry a label 
that reads it is especially important not to use aspirin during 
the last three months of pregnancy unless specifically directed to 
do so by your doctor because it may cause problems in the unborn 
child or complications during delivery 
proposition 65 mandates public warnings but does not dictate 
warning labels on specific products however a spokesman for the 
aspirin industry said a warning label seemed likely in about a year 
the us food and drug administration notified state authorities 
last week that it planned to require a new warning on 
overthecounter aspirin products similar to the warning under 
review by the proposition 65 panel 
but science panel members said they saw no point in waiting for 
federal action aspirin industry representatives said the fda was 
pushed into action by proposition 65 which has served as a model 
for toxics legislation across the country

tens of thousands of israelis rallied 
saturday demanding electoral reform in a movement spurred by public 
anger over political wheelinganddealing in a bid to form a new 
government 
demonstrators who gathered in tel avivs central kings of israel 
square carried israeli flags and wore stickers criticizing both 
major political parties likud and labor 
the stickers read are you sick and tired and horsetraders 
in the market are more decent 
israel television said tens of thousands protested in front of 
city hall while israel army radio estimated the crowd at 250000 
one city official estimated it at more than 120000 police refused 
to give estimates 
the protest was called after labor party leader shimon peres 
announced that he had formed a coalition that included a 
ultraorthodox religious party and a defector from the rightwing 
likud bloc of caretaker prime minister yitzhak shamir labor is a 
leftofcenter party 
peres informed president chaim herzog on wednesday he had put 
together a potential governing coalition the announcement came two 
weeks after he was assigned to try to form a new government 
shamir lost a noconfidence vote march 15 in a crisis triggered 
by a dispute over us conditions for holding israelipalestinian 
peace talks 
peres forced the showdown with shamir who was reluctant to 
accept the us proposals on forming a palestinian delegation 
the protest campaign was initiated by a group of mayors and the 
constitution for israel organization which seeks to revamp the 
political system it also won the support of president herzog 
uriel reichman a law professor who heads the group told israel 
radio reformers wanted direct election of the prime minister and 
one half of the 120 parliament members as well as a bill of rights 
now we are no longer lobbying we are no longer asking now 
we are demanding that the change will come and right away said 
reichman who called the political maneuverings of the two major 
parties a betrayal of trust 
critics have accused both labor and likud of offering government 
money and political jobs to entice small religious factions and 
encourage individual members of parliament to switch sides 
peres reportedly gave 35 million to religious institutions 
affiliated with parties that he hoped would support his bid for 
power hours before he left the finance ministers post last month 
at the same time shamirs likud raised 25 million from party 
contributors as a guarantee to underwrite its promise of a cabinet 
post for yitzhak modai a likud ally who was threatening to defect 
to labor

the chesapeake amp potomac telephone company and 
its parent company have been suspended from signing new contracts 
with the federal government on grounds campp sales people made false 
statements about whether the kind of telephones they proposed to 
install for the treasury department were already in wide use 
treasury officials said the statements were made during recent 
negotiations over a disputed contract in which american telephone amp 
telegraph co is competing with campp and by extension its parent 
bell atlantic corp 
the agency invoked a federal law that allows any agency to hold 
up contract awards from any other federal agency pending resolution 
of the dispute 
in fiscal 1989 585 individuals or companies were suspended from 
receiving new contracts under the regulations treasury applied to 
campp and bell atlantic 
the current ruling does not affect federal contracts already 
signed by campp and bell atlantic including one under which campp is 
to begin switching on a private phone network for federal offices 
in the washington area a job that is estimated to be worth about 
220 million to 280 million over 10 years 
however it would put on hold campps pending bid for a major 
defense department telephone contract known as tempo 
the claims center on whether telephones campp proposes to use on 
the treasury job are available commercially federal contracting 
procedures normally require that items bought by the government be 
markettested so it is not saddled with new unproven equipment 
in a statement issued friday in response to the treasury action 
bell atlantic officials called the suspension an abuse of 
authority and a subversion of the governments own bidding 
process the company accused lowlevel employees at the treasury 
of trying to award atampt contract worth about 90 million to provide 
a 20000line telephone system for 16 treasury locations in the 
district 
twice since 1987 treasury has awarded the contract in question 
to atampt only to have campp win appeals to the general services 
administrations board of contract appeals 
campp will not be harassed out of this competition tony 
murray bell atlantic federal systems division vice president said 
friday the company said it will challenge the treasurys move 
atampt has not commented on the latest development 
campp provides local telephone service to the metropolitan 
washington area and is owned by bell atlantic a philadelphiabased 
regional telephone company

the pistol teddy roosevelt carried in his 
charge up san juan hill has been stolen officials said saturday 
the 45caliber colt revolver was discovered missing from 
sagamore hill the long island home of the nations 26th president 
which is run as a museum by the national park service 
chief ranger ray bloomer who is blind noticed saturday that 
the exhibit case that contained the gun was loose and summoned a 
sighted park service investigator nothing else was missing from 
the case which also contained roosevelts rough riders uniform 
hat and gloves 
it appeared someone forced open a door to the case thursday or 
friday bloomer said fifty to 100 visitors pass through on an 
average day 
the pistol now valued at 500000 was given to roosevelt after 
it was recovered from the battleship maine whose sinking in havana 
harbor in 1898 led to the united states declaration of war against 
spain 
the guns blued barrel is inscribed with the words july 1 
1898 san juan carried and used by col theodore roosevelt and 
from the sunken battleship maine 
roosevelt killed at least one enemy soldier with the gun during 
the charge up san juan hill that gave the us army control of the 
hills overlooking havana and roosevelt his reputation as a national 
hero bloomer said the only other weapon he carried during the 
charge was his sword 
the inscription should make it difficult to sell at its 
estimated value of 500000 said park service spokeswoman edie 
sheanhammond 
roosevelt became president after william mckinley was 
assassinated in 1901 and served until 1909

the united states last month secretly proposed a 
ban on some landbased missiles with multiple nuclear warheads but 
the soviet union said the plan was too limited according to a 
published report 
the new york times reported in its sunday editions that soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev responded to the proposal last week 
complaining that it excluded submarinebased ballistic missiles 
a letter containing gorbachevs reply was delivered to president 
bush friday by soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze the 
paper said quoting administration officials it didnt name 
the white house refused to confirm the offer or refusal the 
times said 
the offer signals an attempt by bush to put his stamp on arms 
reduction talks which thus far have followed proposals made during 
the reagan administration the times said 
the rejection of the proposal caught the white house by 
surprise the times said adding that bush administration officials 
believe the soviet unions tougher position reflects a move by 
soviet military officials to assert themselves 
one unidentified white house official told the times that 
secretary of state james baker iii first presented the proposal to 
shevardnadze last month in namibia where both were attending 
independence ceremonies 
the proposal would ban mobile landbased missiles with multiple 
warheads followed by the eventual elimination of all landbased 
missiles with multiple warheads 
administration officials said moscow showed little interest in 
the first stage of the bush plan the times reported 
that first step which could have been considered as part of the 
strategic arms treaty being negotiated this year would have 
prevented the united states from deploying 10warhead mx missiles 
on rail cars it would have forced moscow to remove its 10warhead 
ss24 missiles from railroad launchers and put them in stationary 
silos 
the united states bases more of its ballistic missile warheads 
at sea while the soviet union has most of its missiles on land

vice adm john m poindexter was regarded 
throughout his navy career as the consummate military aide a 
perfect man to carry out orders with a preciseness that bordered on 
brilliance 
yet he emerged as a national security adviser who would tell 
skeptical congressional committees investigating the irancontra 
affair that the buck stops here with me with regard to the 
decision to divert to the central american contras money made from 
arms sales to iran 
a man once decorated for his efficiency in handling paperwork 
poindexter was convicted saturday of felony charges that make the 
53yearold officer liable for a potential 25year prison term one 
of the charges tearing up paperwork 
when the jury decision was read indictmentbyindictment 
guilty verdictbyguilty verdict the career military man stood at 
attention before the bench rocking forward every so slightly as 
the count was rendered 
his wife an episcopal priest sat stoically beside the chief 
defense lawyers wife mrs poindexter remained still showing no 
emotion until it was over then she inclined her head every so 
slightly on the other womans shoulder an sighed quietly 
linda and john poindexter both from indiana were married in 
1958 two days after he finished first in his class at the us 
naval academy at annapolis he was also brigade commander one of 
only about a halfdozen men this century to graduate no 1 in both 
academics and leadership 
for 20 years she devoted her time to raising the couples five 
boys and when they started to leave home began studying for the 
ministry 
poindexter went on to earn a doctorate in nuclear physics and 
was on the navy fast track in 1981 when he was tapped to become 
military aide to former president reagans first national security 
adviser richard v allen 
when allen was replaced by william p clark jr poindexter 
stayed in the same role and subsequently was a deputy to nsc 
director robert c mcfarlane 
when mcfarlane left poindexter moved into the top nsc job and 
right into the irancontra caldron that was already swirling much 
of it around oliver north a marine lieutenant colonel with a 
natural flair for theatrics who was to emerge as a well known 
national figure a hero to some and a big drawing card at 
conservative fundraisers 
by contrast the jurors who were to convict poindexter indicated 
in their responses to questions during jury selection that his name 
let alone details of the charges against him barely registered 
on their mental radar screens 
poindexter has declined to give interviews since being 
implicated publicly in the affair but interviews with friends 
colleagues and some in congress and elsewhere who are not 
necessarily fond of the admiral have painted an almost universal 
picture of a man more versed in the scientific and military 
pursuits than politics and public relations 
in particular it was said that he never masted the art of 
dealing with congress or with the press 
as an ncs aide in 1985 he was credited within the inner circles 
of the white house with planning and supervising the bold midair 
interception of the plane carrying the hijackers of the achille 
lauro and diverting the plane to italy 
although unknown to the public at the time reagan is reported 
to have said i salute the admiral when he walked into the 
morning nsc briefing the next day 
he wasnt the kind of officer who would do something without 
authority adm daniel j murphy chief of staff to thenvice 
president bush from 1981 to 1985 said of poindexter in an 
interview more than three years ago 
yet it was the same poindexter who told an inquiring 
congressional panel the buck stops here with me i made the 
decision to divert arms sale money to the contras i thought i 
had the authority to do it i thought it was a good idea i was 
convinced the president would in the end think it was a good 
idea but i did not want him to be associated with the decision

allegations of drug use continued to agitate the 
democratic gubernatorial contenders on saturday as a new poll 
found tuesdays runoff too close to call 
the runoff pits state attorney general jim mattox against state 
treasurer ann richards the winning democrat will face republican 
clayton williams in the general election 
a poll for the houston chronicle and the dallas morning news 
showed ms richards backed by 44 percent of democrats who said they 
planned to vote tuesday mattox had 38 percent 16 percent were 
undecided and 3 percent didnt support either candidate according 
to the poll published in the papers sunday editions 
the poll of 759 democrats was conducted last week by the center 
for public policy at the university of houston it had a margin of 
error of 4 percentage points 
mattox who made a political issue of ms richards refusal to 
answer questions about alleged drug use more than 10 years ago on 
saturday found himself again fending off allegations that he smoked 
marijuana in the 1970s 
jim mattox has never used any kind of dangerous drug ever 
the state attorney general said in houston 
a houston lawyer and a former dallas police officer told 
newspapers on thursday they saw mattox smoke marijuana on separate 
occasions in the 1970s then on friday an austin barber told tv 
stations that he smoked marijuana with mattox in dallas about 20 
years ago 
mattox blamed the campaign staff of ms richards the state 
treasurer for planting the allegations with news organizations 
i believe its totally fabricated by the richards campaign 
he said even if ms richards didnt personally talk to those 
accusing him of using marijuana mattox said shes absolutely 
responsible for what took place 
ms richards press secretary monte williams denied mattoxs 
claim and said no one in the richards campaign knows the men 
making the accusations 
we think on tuesday that the voters are going to reject his 
negative campaigning williams said 
williams the republican nominee on saturday made an issue for 
the first time of the row over drugs 
if those democrats keep doing drugs im going to teach them 
the joys of busting rocks both of them williams said in 
dallas making light of one of his commercials 
but he added i probably wont need to as bad as they are 
whipping up on each other 
ms richards has repeatedly answered the question of drug use by 
saying she has not used a moodaltering drug since leaving a 
rehabilitation program for alcoholism 10 years ago 
the issue has dominated the democratic runoff forced after ms 
richards finished the march 13 primary with 39 percent of the vote 
to mattox 37 percent

gorky park a soviet rock superband that 
plays to big crowds in its homeland but small clubs on its first 
american tour appeared before 45000 people saturday at farm aid 
iv 
were not worried were just nervous a little bit 
guitarist ian ianenkov said during a news conference before the 
show at the hoosier dome 
members of the fourman band also brainstormed about doing their 
own farm aid concert in the soviet union 
we want to do the same kind of concert in russia and invite 
everyone to play lead guitarist alexei belov said 
the band urged changes in us agriculture policies warning 
that american farms are becoming more like the huge farming 
cooperatives formed 70 years ago in the soviet union 
first they chased all the farmers off the land and then they 
made big cooperatives big state farms it didnt work said 
belov i dont think you would want in america for it to go like 
this 
gorky park whose members are culled from some of the most 
popular soviet bands regularly attract sellout crowds at home but 
have drawn mostly small curious club crowds during the us tour 
the group nurtured by jon bon jovi and invited to farm aid by 
john mellencamp was among the few foreign performers in the

former national security adviser john 
poindexter was convicted saturday of conspiracy obstruction and 
lying to congress in the irancontra scandal which marred the last 
two years of ronald reagans presidency 
a federal court jury found poindexter guilty on all five felony 
charges against him he could face up to 25 years in prison and 
125 million in fines when he is sentenced june 11 
poindexters lawyers said they would appeal 
in reaching the verdict jurors rejected reagans claim in 
videotaped testimony that no crimes were committed in his 
administrations secret arms sales to iran and diversion of profits 
to help the nicaraguan contra rebels 
president reagan was wrong and incorrect said prosecutor 
dan webb noting the earlier conviction of poindexters former aide 
oliver north 
poindexter 53 had appeared confident as he walked into the 
courtroom shortly after noon on the sixth day of jury 
deliberations he stood facing the jurors as the 25yearold 
foreman wayne mitchell rose to his feet to read the verdicts 
guilty mitchell said as the clerk read each of the five 
criminal charges aloud 
there was silence in the courtroom as the first verdict was 
returned and then a murmur as mitchell continued to read guilty 
verdicts on each of the five counts 
the foreman was quoted later as saying reagans testimony had 
little impact on the jurors verdict 
mr reagans testimony didnt play any more of an important 
role than any other testimony mitchell told washington post 
reporters in an interview at his apartment actually he didnt 
give much information 
mitchell said he viewed norths testimony considered by 
prosecutors to be damaging to poindexter as coming from a witness 
who was there trying to protect himself 
to me oliver north was a soldier mitchell said of 
course i didnt figure he would come in there and tell lies 
against his superiors i saw he was there for protection of 
himself rather than mr poindexter 
the jury foreman said of poindexter all in all i think he 
was very dedicated but guilty as charged 
did the jurors consider reagan ultimately responsible for the 
irancontra case 
thats dynamite mitchell said i would rather not answer 
that 
webb said the prosecution team would meet in the next two weeks 
to make a sentencing recommendation to us district court judge 
harold greene 
poindexters conviction marks the end of a very difficult and 
very important trial in american history he said 
high men in government office who have the responsibility for 
the security of this nation ought not to be allowed to commit 
crimes to pursue their own selfinterest webb said 
poindexter is the third top reagan administration figure 
convicted in the scandal the others north and former national 
security adviser robert mcfarlane have not served any jail time 
north was convicted in a jury trial and mcfarlane pleaded guilty 
poindexter was convicted of conspiring with north businessman 
richard secord and others to conceal the truth about irancontra 
from congress 
in an interview webb said the others included cia director 
william casey and mcfarlane 
along with north secord and poindexter those are clearly the 
people we established are the most deeply involved in this 
conspiracy said webb 
casey told the house intelligence committee on nov 21 1986 
that there had been no presidential finding approving the hawks 
shipment us rep lee hamilton dind testified at the trial of 
poindexter 
specifically poindexter was accused of covering up norths 
secret contra resupply network and the us role in a ciaassisted 
shipment of hawk missiles to iran in november 1985 
norths contra military assistance operation took place during a 
congressional aid ban that required the cia to withdraw military 
support for the rebel force the hawks shipment was ratified by a 
politically embarrassing presidential document that depicted the 
missile delivery as a swap of arms for hostages 
poindexter tore up the document nov 21 1986 hours after 
telling congress that reagan hadnt approved the shipment on nov 
13 1986 reagan had told the nation in a televised address that 
we did not trade weapons for hostages 
poindexter said nothing as he left the us courthouse a 
reporter asked whether he had any second thoughts about not taking 
the witness stand in his own defense 
no second thoughts responded poindexters wife linda who 
was at her husbands side 
were naturally disappointed with the verdict in this case 
but were going to appeal it and were going to keep fighting it as 
hard as we can defense attorney richard beckler said 
during the fiveweek trial poindexters attorneys suggested 
that his actions were aimed at protecting the president 
even being charitable to admiral poindexter he did it because 
he wanted to protect the political viability of ronald reagan and 
i consider that to be selfinterest webb said people do not 
commit crimes to protect the public good 
webb said a decision on whether prosecutors will recommend that 
poindexter be given jail time will be made in consultation with 
independent counsel lawrence walsh whose office has been 
investigating the irancontra scandal since december 1986 
norths secret contra operation was set up in 1984 as congress 
was cutting off us military aid to the rebel force 
the ciaassisted shipment of hawk missiles was approved by 
reagan after it actually took place the approval came in a 
socalled finding signed by reagan 
the finding depicted the administration as trading arms for 
hostages something reagan had said he would never do 
in addition to tearing up the finding poindexter deleted 5000 
computer messages in his final days on the job his defense was 
that employees leaving the government were encouraged to purge 
their computer files prosecutors said he was trying to cover up 
his lies to congress 
poindexter told congress he didnt find out about the hawks 
delivery until five weeks after it occurred and that he hadnt 
realized other us officials might have known about the shipment 
ahead of time 
prosecutors said the misstatements were designed to avoid 
raising questions about the politically embarrassing finding 
beckler said the misstatements resulted from an imperfect memory 
and were not an attempt to cover up 
poindexter supposedly found out at the end of november about 
the hawks shipment rather than in january and that is no big deal 
that is a fiveweek mistake beckler told the jury in final 
arguments considering all he had to do its not too bad that he 
only missed by five weeks 
the national security adviser was the man in charge of the 
us role in the hawks shipment responded irancontra prosecutor

a fourth body was found saturday as 
authorities continued a toptobottom search of the wreckage of a 
hotel that was swept by fire as residents slept 
ten tenants were still unaccountedfor in the fire that hit the 
fontana hotel before dawn friday 
we believe there are more victims inside said police capt 
rocco deleo what we are doing is getting details from relatives 
of people who we believe are missing and getting the physical 
characteristics of these persons 
one hundred and one of the 102 rooms were rented out but no one 
is sure exactly how many people were in the hotel at the time of 
the fire said olimpia mihai one of the fontanas ownermanagers 
estimates of the number of inhabitants has ranged up to 150 the 
registration records were burned in the fire 
as federal state and city teams launched a toptobottom 
search a crane was brought in to help pick apart the gutted ruins 
of the hotel 
investigators broke off their search at sundown saturday and 
planned to return sunday morning with specially trained dogs to 
search for bodies said miami beach police detective jim hyde 
with the cause still a mystery us magistrate linnea johnson 
issued a search warrant at the request of the us bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms to preserve any evidence that might 
be needed later in court the bureau conducts arson investigations 
mayor alex daoud said fire officials told him friday that arson 
was strongly suspected but fire chief branaird dorris said tenants 
had mentioned a water leak which raised the possibility of an 
electrical short 
whenever you have a serious loss of life and a substantial 
loss of property damage and money a warrant is routine hyde 
said saturday 
us attorney dexter lehtinen who donned a hard hat to inspect 
the threestory hotel said the purpose of the warrant was to 
legally preserve any possible evidence 
he played down the significance of his visit saying you 
shouldnt judge the importance of any particular investigation by 
what officials are there 
asked when the death toll would be known robert creighton atf 
agent in charge of the florida office said we may have that in 
two days it all depends on what we find 
names of 14 residents who had not been seen since the fire were 
provided by surviving tenants 
the four bodies found so far two women a man and a fourth 
person whose sex wasnt immediately determined were tentatively 
assumed to be among the 14 missing hyde said 
were bringing our total of unaccountedfor people to ten 
hyde said again this is an approximate guesstimate based on 
information we were given by residents of the hotel 
twentyone hotel residents were taken to three area hospitals 
friday and five remained hospitalized in good condition saturday

investigation into the alleged abduction torture and sexual abuse 
by government agents of an american nun

said sister francisco wilhelm at a news conference on friday 
some guatemalan officials have alleged that the kidnapping of

matter 
we know and gen carlos morales the security minister has 
admitted that there are thousands of cases like dianas in 
guatemala sister wilhelm said by the grace of god she was 
freed

a grand jury indicted an arts center and its 
director on obscenity charges saturday for an exhibit of the late 
robert mapplethorpes photographs including some with partly nude 
children or homosexual acts 
despite the indictment the controversial photos will remain in 
the exhibit said dennis barrie director of the contemporary arts 
center 
the show will continue barrie said of the exhibit which 
prompted debate last year in congress over federal funding for the 
arts when sen jesse helms rnc objected to some of the photos 
there is simply nothing wrong with this exhibition barrie 
said its an important exhibition its important that it be 
seen here 
attorneys for the center planned to ask us district judge carl 
rubin for a temporary restraining order sunday barring the hamilton 
county prosecutor the county sheriff and the cincinnati police 
chief from closing the show center spokeswoman amy banister said 
saturday night 
the hamilton county grand jury indicted the arts center and 
barrie on two misdemeanor counts each of pandering obscenity and 
illegally using a minor in nudityoriented material after jurors 
viewed the exhibition anonymously among the crowd saturday the 
grand jury concluded that seven of the 175 photographs are obscene 
the indictment touched off an emotional rally saturday afternoon 
by patrons who were ordered out of the center while police 
videotaped the display under protection of a search warrant 
the whole world is watching the whole world is laughing 
several hundred patrons chanted while they waited outside the 
center 
the crowd also gave nazi salutes and shouted sieg heil to 
officers videotaping the show 
the show was reopened after police finished their videotaping in 
about 45 minutes no arrests were made 
about 650 people saw the exhibit before it was closed for the 
videotaping at midday in all more than 3000 people paid 5 each 
on saturday to view the exhibit easily breaking the centers 
attendance record for an opening day ms banister said 
the centers largest previous openingday crowd was 1000 in 
late 1988 for a show on computers and art she said 
although police didnt confiscate any of the photographs 
saturday hamilton county prosecutor arthur ney suggested further 
action would be taken next week unless the pictures in question are 
voluntarily removed he said no action would be taken until monday 
or tuesday 
theres always a possibility that each day this continues 
could be an added criminal action or sanction ney told a hastily 
called news conference im not saying there will be im saying 
there could be 
the arts center refused to admit people under 18 to the show 
unless they were accompanied by parents the center also put the 
controversial photos in a separate display room 
the exhibit opened to the public saturday morning after an 
evening preview showing that attracted more than 4000 members of 
the center 
a demonstrator at a museum entrance saturday held up a sign 
reading censorship is obscene at another entrance a sign 
read stop pornography stop perversion stop mapplethorpe 
amateur photographer john daniels praised the photos and said 
the controversy prompted him to attend the opening 
its embarrassing to be from cincinnati with this kind of 
reaction and be seen as a backward jerkwater town daniels said 
i hope that the turnout demonstrates that cincinnati really is 
enlightened 
the university of pennsylvanias institute of contemporary art 
organized the exhibit in the fall of 1988 it drew large crowds in 
philadelphia in december 1988 and in chicago at the time of

on both charges the maximum sentence for the arts center would be 
a 10000 fine 
lawyers for the city and county told a municipal court judge on 
friday that no decision had been made about whether the photos were 
obscene ney said saturday he considers them personally offensive 
but that he would leave it to a jury to decide whether they are 
obscene

content that the law has been followed in issuing the indictments 
there are no raving neanderthals running amok in the streets

a north sea ferry with nearly 500 people 
aboard caught fire before dawn saturday suffocating many 
passengers who tried to flee down smokefilled corridors about 150 
people were reported killed and at least 20 injured 
the danish owners of the car ferry said they strongly suspected 
arson some passengers said the boats fire alarms didnt work and 
the crew seemed unprepared for the emergency 
there were plenty of people aboard and i guess they all tried 
to leave at the same time said norwegian firefighter svenjohan 
svenson some of those who got left behind and died just didnt 
find their way out 
dr tom brokopp leader of a swedish medical rescue team told 
reporters at the swedish port of lysekil that 75 bodies were 
counted so far on the scandinavian star ferry and that 71 more were 
dead or missing he said some missing were still in the ship and 
others were in the sea 
however assistant oslo police commissioner bjoern gran told 
norwegian radio that the deaths would total about 150 
we have been in contact with swedish police and they say 
there were no more survivors on board gran said 
in oslo jan erik nermoen representing the danish vrdano line 
that owns the ship said 493 passengers and crew were on a manifest 
the ferry caught fire early saturday after leaving oslo en route 
to the danish port of frederikshavn 
up to 340 people were reported rescued from lifeboats by 
helicopters and about seven nearby vessels in the skagerrak 
straits 44 miles south of the norwegian ferder island more than 
20 injured were taken to hospitals 
the swedish news agency tt said it was the worst ferry disaster 
in scandinavian waters 
the fire was the worst north sea ship disaster since march 6 
1987 when a car ferry the herald of free enterprise capsized off 
the belgian port of zeebrugge killing 189 people that accident 
was blamed on ship personnel who failed to close bow doors 
allowing water to rush in 
the scandinavian star still burning and listing was guided by 
tugs to a dock in lysekil port on swedens west coast saturday 
night more than 18 hours after it caught fire much of the 
midships section on the upper decks was blackened 
more than 100 bodies remained aboard district police chief roar 
onso said adding that they would not be removed before sunday he 
said it would take several days to investigate the cause of the 
fire 
most of the dead had apparently succumbed to smoke and few were 
seriously burned said conny englund head of the swedish sea 
rescue center at lysekil firemen who probed the blackened 
compartments of the 10000ton ferry said they found three 
passengers alive and apparently uninjured among the many bodies 
we woke up in the middle of the night i heard a noise 
outside i went out of the cabin and saw thick black smoke said 
danish passenger leo odeland an oslo resident traveling with his 
wife and two daughters 
nothing happened when i pushed the fire alarm i hadnt heard 
the alarm go off at another place where there was supposed to be 
an alarm nothing was there 
odeland said the crew was apparently new and untrained 
it was hard to get the lifeboat into the water and then the 
motor didnt start he said adding that the lifeboat drifted 
away and a soviet freighter picked them up 
brokopp quoted several passengers as saying alarms didnt work 
and crew members had trouble understanding each other because they 
spoke different languages 
it was chaotic said passenger eli kvale neilsen it was 
clear that the crew was not trained for this kind of situation 
passenger and crew lists were not immediately available rescue 
officials said and this led to confusion about the numbers and 
identities of those aboard the scandinavian star the crew was 
believed to be largely portuguese with scandinavian officers 
the bahamianregistered ferry is owned by the danish shipping 
company vrdano line seaescape ltd of miami sold the ship to 
vrdano last month a seaescape spokeswoman said in a telephone 
interview from miami 
danish radio quoted ole hansen managing director of the danish 
company as saying he was virtually certain the fire had been 
deliberately set aboard the ferry 
hansen speaking at a news conference in copenhagen insisted 
the vessel was safe but he refused to discuss the reports that 
alarms had not worked on the ferry and that the crew was untrained 
company officials said two fires broke out on separate decks 
within 15 minutes crew members reportedly extinguished the first 
fire then discovered a bigger blaze one deck below 
scandinavian news reports quoted survivors as saying the fire 
began on a low deck beneath the ferrys water line and near the 
stern thick smoke spread upward through the deck where 
passengers cars were parked and through a higher deck where a 
casino and bars are located 
maritime and police officials in sweden denmark and norway 
announced plans for a joint investigation gran told reporters that

the cuban supreme court on friday rejected an 
appeal by two human rights activists sentenced to prison for 
criticizing a drug trial that led to the execution of four military 
officers a news report said 
the cuban news agency prensa latina said the court upheld the 
sentences handed down last november to elizardo sanchez santa cruz 
and hiram abi cobas nunez 
both were convicted of crimes against the state 
the intention of the accused was to impair the prestige of and 
discredit the cuban state and affect its relations with other 
nations by propagating false and tendentious news prensa latina 
monitored in mexico city quoted the supreme court as saying 
sanchez santa cruz received two years imprisonment and cobas 
nunez 18 months 
prensa latina said the two wrote a joint communique 
criticizing the court martial that convicted 14 military officers 
of drugtrafficking four of whom were executed in july 
the statement said the court martial violated legal regulations 
and rights of the accused prensa latina said 
maj gen arnaldo ochoa a war hero who fought with president 
fidel castro in cubas revolution and three fellow officers were 
executed by firing squad in july for their involvement in the drug 
trafficking scandal 
also executed were col antonio de la guardia font maj amado 
pardo and capt jorge martinez 
ochoa had been a trusted aide to castro commanding cuban forces 
in ethiopia and angola and heading a cuban military mission to 
nicaragua 
the scandal stunned and embarrassed castro and his communist 
government which for years denied us accusations that cuba was 
being used to smuggle drugs into the united states 
another 10 officers were sentenced to prison terms and the 
scandal led to a major shakeup of the armed forces the interior 
ministry and the cubas state security force

simha vaknins boyfriend a tall handsome man 
was known to everyone in her town of pardes hanna as avi levy a 
jew from zicharon yaacov five miles away 
in zicharon yaacov where he had lived for 20 years avi was 
abed altiar a member of the towns only arab family 
tiar wanted to be a jew and when his masquerade was exposed 
last month his hopes of escaping the limitations of being arab in 
israel collapsed 
police said he fatally shot simha and jill eden a jewish woman 
from his own village who had rejected him then took his own life 
the case illuminates the element of identity that has 
exacerbated the decadeslong political conflict between arab and 
jew 
intermarriages are not accepted by either community there are 
only a few hundred in israel a nation of 35 million jews and 
810000 arabs 
yochanan peres a sociology professor at tel aviv university 
said the taboo against marrying outside the group is so strong that 
the few violators are put in a suicidal situation 
abed altiar seemed able to overcome the obstacles if anyone 
could 
residents of zicharon yaacov describe the 23yearold farm 
worker as appearing jewish in every way education dress 
flawless hebrew sense of humor and friendships they say he was 
happy and wellliked and for most of his life stayed out of 
trouble 
then two years ago tiar fell in love with jill eden a 
30yearold beautician in his hometown 
she was friendly but did not reciprocate romantic interest and 
he began to press her 
yitzhak zur police commander of the town in northern israel 
said tiar wrote love letters to ms eden and painted messages on a 
wall near her house 
he began threatening her a year ago and ms eden complained to 
the police tiar was convicted of harassment and released on 
probation 
a few months later tiar met simha vaknin 20 who worked at a 
boarding school for retarded children in pardes hanna he 
introduced himself as avi levy a name as common in hebrew as john 
smith in english 
he would be here from first thing in the morning said 
simhas brother yaacov we knew him as a jew in everything he 
never gave a single sign that would give him away 
her brother said simha never considered the possibility that 
avi was not jewish until the beginning of march when she spoke 
to his older sister and detected a slight arab accent tiar allayed 
her doubts by showing her a forged army identity card 
while they sat in his car a week later a policeman stopped for 
a routine check of their identity cards police said they arrested 
tiar for possessing a counterfeit card and told simha his true 
identity 
she decided from that moment to break it off her brother 
said she told him very politely that he had lied to her this 
whole time and she didnt want to continue their relationship 
if she had known avi was an arab simha never would have 
become involved with him yaacov said 
were not interested in relationships like that the brother 
said its not natural its not healthy 
a few days later tiar arrived at the school where simha worked 
zur the zicharon yaacov police commander said the young man 
persuaded her to get into his car drove to the outskirts of pardes 
hanna and shot her to death 
tiar then drove to zicharon yaacov and came upon jill eden 
leaving work followed her home and shot her to death as she was 
entering her apartment zur said 
that evening in the orchard where he worked tiar wrote a 
suicide note in hebrew on a cardboard box and shot himself in the 
head police would not disclose the notes contents but the daily 
maariv quoted it as saying they wouldnt let me live as jew 
he told me he wanted to be a jew said shai zukerman the 
dead mans employer he was born an arab but among the arabs he 
was a jew and among the jews he was an arab

since last fall the price of cocoa has risen 300 a ton off the 
14year low of 900 despite six consecutive seasons of surplus 
production and record inventories 
analysts say there are several reasons for the upsurge 
including a concern the west african crop areas primarily the 
ivory coast nigeria and cameroon have received only a quarter of 
their normal rainfall in the past two months 
there also has been some warming of the central pacific ocean 
off the coasts of chile and peru a phenomenon that in the past has 
caused dry spells and droughts in the cocoa growing areas of brazil 
and in west africa 
political unrest in the ivory coast the worlds largest cocoa 
producer also is providing a boost to prices 
the cocoa market has been further boosted by a concern over the 
availabilty of cocoa to processors says sandra kaul an analyst 
with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
ms kaul noted the activity in the market is taking place in 
between two crops the main crop harvest takes place between 
september and january and supplies have been sold out the 
secondary harvest begins next month 
because so little cocoa is available producers have been less 
inclined to protect themselves in the futures market where they 
could sell cocoa contracts and lock in prices now 
ms kaul added that against the background of concern about the 
weather and political stability the international cocoa agreement 
has been extended for another two years eliminating the prospect 
that the agreements 250000 ton buffer stock of cocoa beans will 
be released into the market 
judy ganes an analyst with merrill lynch in new york said the 
bullish cocoa market was somewhat of a surprise because most 
traders had a bearish expectation of a soft market after years of 
oversupply 
one analyst who asked not to be identified said the technical 
nature of the price rise is an indication traders are finding a way 
to construe any bit of information about the crop as bullish 
certainly if it rains in west africa or any of the other 
cocoa growing regions its the price surge over ms ganes 
said

stockmarket investors are bracing for a new 
round of negative earnings news over the next few weeks as 
corporations post results for the first quarter of 1990 
but if the suspicions of some analysts prove correct the gloomy 
mood that has prevailed in the earnings outlook for most of the 
past year could begin to brighten in the months ahead 
their hopes are based to a great degree on recent signs that 
business activity is slowly pulling out of its recent slowdown 
apparently having staved off a fullscale recession 
it is more likely than not that we are passing the low point 
in corporate profits asserts michael sherman investment 
strategist at shearson lehman hutton inc 
in the last half of 1989 by shermans reckoning operating 
earnings for the companies that make up standard amp poors 500stock 
composite index showed an average decline of 4 percent 
shearson estimates that the quarter ended march 31 will see a 
57 percent drop from the like period last year to be followed by 
a 2 percent shortfall in the second quarter 
but after that the firm projects small gains in the third 
quarter perhaps quickly expanding to record levels as 1990 comes 
to a close if they follow such a script profits could finish the 
year with a small net gain over 1989 
corporate america has not thrown in the towel on 1990 says 
stephen roach economist at the investment banking firm of morgan 
stanley amp co 
thats a bold assertion to say the least but one that draws 
ample support from what is shaping up to be a pleasant surprise on 
corporate profits 
we have long maintained that a resilient american consumer 
will provide solid support to the us economy in 1990 and now it 
seems as if the business sector will follow suit 
the prospective timing of any upswing in profits is the subject 
of much disagreement an earnings pickup will be delayed til 
late 1990 argues thomas doerflinger at painewebber inc 
but for next year he projects a 13 percent improvement from 1990 
levels this forecast implies that the fed will successfully 
engineer an antiinflationary soft landing he says 
despite such upbeat thoughts the stock market managed only a 
mixed showing in the past week the dow jones average of 30 
industrials rose 991 to 271712 
the new york stock exchange composite index slipped 07 to 
18678 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
fell 464 to 43090 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 74 at 36101 
volume on the big board averaged 14397 million shares a day 
against 13231 million the week before 
for the immediate future one point of particular concern for 
many analysts is earnings in the banking industry 
entangled as they are in many of the debt problems the economy 
is grappling with ranging from junk bonds and third world loans 
to real estate the banks now face what looks like a long period 
of exacting scrutiny by federal regulators looking into their 
lending practices 
we suspect that the president the treasury and the federal 
reserve are going to have something to say about how this process 
unfolds observed sherman 
in the end it is healthy that the office of the controller 
of the currency is forcing banks to tighten up their lending 
standards 
however the economic repercussions of these actions should be 
controlled and will be controlled before they do major damage to 
the total economy

oil prices are weakening a decline traced to 
rising opec production seasonal slack demand and the notable 
absence of any jolting events such as the exxon valdez spill that 
helped traumatize the market last year 
nonetheless it appears unlikely that prices will fall 
dramatically and some analysts say the market is much more stable 
than at any time in the recent past if these trends persist 
motorists shouldnt see any sudden price changes in gasoline as the 
summer driving season begins 
others however contend that the oil market in general is much 
more vulnerable to disruptions now partly because of the growing 
integration of the world economy and some politically unstable 
hotspots 
if for example soviet oilworkers went on strike or chemical 
warfare broke out in the middle east or another major spill fouled 
the us coast the psychological impact could give the oil market 
a serious case of nerves and force prices up sharply 
most of the oilprice decline this past week was attributed to 
new evidence that suggests the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries is aggressively producing oil in what has been a slack 
demand period between winter and summer when most refiners 
curtail operations 
opec accounts for a growing chunk of world production and has 
doubled its market share in the united states over the past four 
years from about 12 percent to nearly 25 percent 
the price of west texas intermediate the primary grade of us 
crude and a widely followed market barometer finished the past 
week at 1915 per 42gallon barrel down more than 1 a barrel 
from a week earlier and down about 4 from the beginning of this 
year wholesale gasoline prices also dropped sharply but some 
strategists believe these declines wont last long 
right now its perceived there isnt going to be a crash in 
prices said kevin lindemer associate director of cambridge 
energy research associates in cambridge mass we can expect a 
little bit of price weakness but i think this is something thats 
typical for this time of the year 
it remains unclear why opec production is so intense oil 
intelligence references that track the cartels output estimate the 
13 members are producing about 235 million barrels a day which is 
about the highest level in eight years if that persists a serious 
price decline would seem inevitable 
at the same time however much of that oil is getting soaked up 
by industrialized areas of the world moreover potential markets 
that nobody thought existed a year ago the most notable example 
is eastern europe could provide new sources of demand for opec 
oil 
edward n krapels president of energy security analysis a 
washingtonbased research concern that tracks prices worldwide 
said theres another wrinkle in the world oil equation the 
difference between lowsulphur sweet crudes such as west texas 
intermediate and the highersulphur sour grades that span much 
of what opec sells 
the sour crudes are plentiful but require intense refining to 
produce highquality gasoline while sweet crudes are much cheaper 
to process this is important because us oil companies play a 
major role in refining sour crudes and could use their leverage to 
hold down prices charged by producers 
we think west texas intermediate will stabilize at about 19 
to 20 a barrel but unfortunately for exporters highsulphur oil 
will fall further krapels said predicting less than 15 a 
barrel for dubai a standard middle east crude 
so its kind of a bifurcated view he said you expect the 
price of the dirty stuff to be lower than the clean stuff the 
refiners are in a very strong negotiating position 
in other business and economic news this past week 
the governmentdirected savings amp loan salvation effort took 
several dramatic turns most notable were the record 30year prison 
sentence imposed on a failed texas thrifts former executive 
convicted of fraud a congressional auditor prediction that the 
bailout cost could hit 500 billion if the economy falters more 
than triple the amount the white house forecast last year and 
senate approval of labor lawyer timothy ryan as top sampl regulator 
nullifying a court decision that had threatened to derail the 
entire rescue effort 
japan and the united states agreed on a broad economic pact 
designed to make it easier for foreigners to do business in japan 
and make american industry more competitive the pact was hailed as 
a major event in relations between the worlds two largest 
economies but it remains unclear whether and when its effects will 
be felt 
the long battle for control of united airlines appeared to be 
near an end directors of parent company ual corp agreed to a 
438 billion takeover offer from employees about 24 billion 
less than a debtfinanced acquisition proposal that collapsed a 
half year ago 
general motors corp named robert stempel as chairman and chief 
executive to succeed roger smith when he retires in august the 
appointment of stempel to take the helm of the nations biggest 
industrial company was expected and many believe he will play a 
more aggressive role in gms car design and development than smith 
who was widely criticized because of his accounting background
