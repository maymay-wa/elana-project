some say 1989 has been bangkoks year 
of the condominium others call it the year of greed 
the air of this once languid city of treeshaded canals and 
quiet temples now is filled with the thud of pile drivers and the 
thunder of traffic 
there seems to be no reprieve bangkok has become a vast work 
site of mushrooming highrises its streets choked with traffic and 
pollution at dangerously high levels 
the boom began about three years ago with annual growth rates 
around 9 percent to 10 percent thailand is talked about as asias 
next economic miracle and bangkok as the dynamic hub of peninsular 
southeast asia 
land prices in the city have soared to as high as 1115 a 
square foot in prime areas millions are being made in land 
speculation and construction rents not long ago among the most 
reasonable in the world are approaching the levels of new york 
hong kong and london 
in the upper class residential area along sukhumvit road more 
than 50 towering condominiums apartment blocks and office 
buildings are rising on what were once leafy family compounds and 
peaceful lanes 
what worries planners and many citizens is that bangkok is not 
only destroying its past but possibly also its future with 
unplanned growth 
forecasts are largely ominous 
the united nations predicts bangkoks population will nearly 
double to 12 million by 2000 making it the 10th largest city in 
the world 
the thailand development and research institute says the citys 
mighty menam chao phraya the river of kings will be devoid of 
all aquatic life by the end of the century unless decisive action 
is taken immediately every day the institute says tons of 
untreated waste pour into the river from sewers and the 
nowbefouled canals that earned bangkok the name venice of the 
east 
already serious pollution is expected to worsen as more 
factories sprout around the capital the main culprit now in air 
pollution is the omnipresent motor vehicle and its leaded fuel 
the national environment board recently found lead levels along 
bangkok streets to be up to four times higher than standards in the 
united states and hospitals are reporting children with abnormally 
high lead levels in their systems 
the topic of inordinate greed by the few has become the talk of 
the town a mefirst attitude is often held responsible for 
many of bangkoks woes 
i believe if they could dig up thailand and put it in a 
parcel they would sell the country too bangkok post columnist 
normita tongtham wrote recently of what he described as 
unscrupulous businessmen 
academics journalists and some technocrats criticize what they 
say is blatant pollution by commerical enterprises disregard for 
public wellbeing by real estate developers and the quick resort 
to bribery to circumvent regulations and laws 
the critics claim vast economic power and behindthescenes 
decisionmaking is still in the hands of a few chinesethai 
families and say it is their ethos that now pervades bangkok rather 
than the traditional thai one of being satisfied with a modest 
lifestyle 
standing in stark contrast is chamlong srimuang widely expected 
to win reelection in january as bangkoks mayor 
a 55yearold buddhist he seems to represent older rural 
values that still attract a large albeit still largely powerless 
segment of bangkoks population 
we must not be selfish is one of chamlongs tenets another 
is eat less and spend less 
he means what he says 
chamlong sleeps on a floor mat eats one meal a day and dresses 
in the roughspun cotton shirts of upcountry farmers he drives a 
battered old car and has donated his salary to the city

to load the 65pound carcass into a supermarket cart they were 
caught by the night watchman and taken to a police station

ostrichlike bird from brazils central plains killing one is 
considered an ecological crime and punishable by up to six 
years in prison

commuters brush past the outstretched paper cup 
as its holder serenades them in the subway with the hymn there 
is no secret what god can do 
walter mckinney sings for his supper which is soup and a bagel 
when he can get it i might have to sing 35 to 40 minutes to get 
a dime he said 
its the season of giving and shoppers sashay to department 
stores in mink coats and furlined boots 
over a pair of pajamas mckinney wears four pairs of pants two 
shirts two sweaters two jackets and two coats the sleeve on his 
gray outercoat a pierre cardin donated by a wall street 
benefactor was torn from cuff to shoulder in a tussle with a 
policeman 
his fur scarf came from a womans coat found in the trash his 
feet are shod with reebok sneakers salvaged from a shoe stores 
garbage the shoestrings are missing seized after his last arrest 
thats standard police procedure so prisoners wont hang themselves 
his raspy wailings strain to be heard above the screeching train 
brakes and cranking turnstiles at a midtown subway stop 
its hard to get money from people today mckinney lamented 
theyre fed up theyre distrustful in a lot of cases theyre 
hostile they dont want to be bothered 
there aint no generosity 
a good day mckinney says brings 20 a nickle or dime or 
quarter at a time for five hours of gospel melodies and ramblings 
on abortion the death penalty and el salvador a bad day means an 
empty cup and an empty belly 
hes not alone in the streets homeless vietnam vets beggars in 
wheelchairs and mooching musicians playing violins all have their 
hands out 
the competition makes for tough times even at this time of year 
when new york giftwraps an entire fifth avenue building hangs a 
2ton snowflake as a street ornament and adorns a 65foot tree with 
miles of lights 
it seems like christmas and yet mckinney says police ran him 
off when he was panhandling shoppers outside bloomingdales he 
says hes been kicked by security guards and tossed down escalators 
by street gangs he says he has been spat upon and pelted with 
bottles 
mckinney twice divorced says he has no other way to survive a 
native of sanford fla he hasnt had a job in 20 years and 
prefers the streets to shelters which attract gangs and psychos 
theres no stigma to begging its better than stealing he 
said 
if a days collections are paltry mckinney sifts for scraps in 
the garbage he interrupted an interview to retrieve a discarded 
meatloaf sandwich 
you got to take advantage of every opportunity he explained 
the hard life yields a hard look 
mckinneys dreadlocks which he says havent been shorn in four 
years bulge from a painters cap a fresh scar runs from under his 
right eye to his nose his upper gum is toothless except for the 
left canine 
a canvas backpack pinned shut stores his bible a spare pair of 
socks his hat and gloves 
everything i have i found i aint bought nothing but food for 
20 years mckinney said 
well not exactly hes partial to quarts of ballantines beer 
his presmoked cigarettes are reclaimed from the floor 
theres a momentary glimmer of christmas at the third avenue and 
53rd street subway stop where he offers his daily hymns someone 
requests silent night its worth a quarter 
with the days take he buys a beer and heads to harlem to eat 
at night mckinney trudges the streets prostitutes are the only 
other creatures walking 
if he gets too cold a subway corridor provides shelter or he 
may just sleep on the train his way of beating the chill you 
just keep moving 
mornings find him at a bench in battery park where hedges are a 
windbreak there he can rehearse or read his discarded newspapers 
that bench is my home its the one place i can go and feel 
safe and secure mckinney said i like to amble about not be 
hassled and bothered by the devils and demons 
then hes off to wall street where his ragtag clothes from a 
giveaway bin clash with the gray flannel of brokers he washes his 
feet in restroom sinks of office buildings or trinity church 
eventually his routine takes him back to the subway platform 
every day holiday or not 
singing he sticks out the modern day version of the tin cup a 
crumpled paper coffee container decorated with scenes of greek 
temples and the words we are happy to serve you 
i never asked for anything mckinney said i have the cup 
out to receive if they care to give

members of congress are tempering their 
initial support of president bushs decision to attack gen manuel 
antonio noriegas stronghold with concern about the renegade 
dictators elusiveness and a possible long stay in panama for us 
troops 
i can see a scenario whereby the support for this operation 
could turn difficult for the president rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee told reporters on 
wednesday 
if there is a beginning middle and end to american military 
involvement it is far better than having this thing dragging out 
over weeks and months added sen robert w kasten jr rwis 
in the hours after american forces invaded panama lawmakers 
from both parties endorsed bushs action as the only option left to 
remove suspected drug trafficker noriega and establish a democratic 
government 
president bushs actions were justified based on the changing 
and alarming circumstances of recent weeks in panama said sen 
sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services committee 
sen richard lugar rind a senior foreign relations committee 
member called the invasion an overwhelming success because 
democracy has now been inaugurated and installed in panama 
but as the day wore on with reports of americans held captive 
and noriega still a fugitive lawmakers hinted that the us 
action dubbed operation just cause may prove problematic 
noriega continues to elude us and we dont know where he is 
plus the hostage situation thats a very difficult hostage 
situation plus some kind of a continued american presence loss of 
life here and there occasional sniper fire aspin said 
kasten ranking republican on the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on foreign operations stressed the importance of the 
united states withdrawing its army rangers and special forces as 
quickly as possible 
international public opinion in latin america might well turn 
against the united states if there is sustained fighting with 
us troops in uniform and panamanian blood being spilled kasten 
said 
sen charles robb dva emerging from a classified briefing 
conducted by defense and state department officials said its 
fair to say the duration of the operation is of serious concern for 
a good number of people 
but sen john warner rva ranking minority member on the 
senate armed services committee cautioned against imposing a 
schedule on troop withdrawal 
i dont think we should try to impress a time line warner 
said after the briefing 
aspin predicted that some us forces will remain in panama for 
several months possibly a year shoring up the decimated 
panamanian defense forces most of whom served as police custom 
inspectors or in some public safety capacity 
the us presence was likened to the situation in grenada when 
american mps remained for several months after the invasion 
in addition to the concern over the presence of us forces 
lawmakers said interpretation of the panamanian invasion as a major 
achievement was complicated by noriega who remains at large 
the fact that general noriega is unaccounted for means that 
the principle issue is unresolved robb said 
now it is our responsibility to track down the renegade 
general noriega and bring him to the united states where he can be 
tried and punished as the criminal he truly is added sen 
christopher s bond rmo 
aspin said he believes bush will be under some political heat 
if two three days from now we still have not found noriega and 
captured him the wisconsin democrat however cautioned against 
judging the success of the operation on whether noriega is captured 
other lawmakers questioned the invasions impact on us 
relations with central american nations 
i am gravely concerned that this unilateral military 
intervention may do longterm damage to our foreign policy to our 
ability to work with other nations in latin america and to our 
goal of achieving lasting democracy in the region said sen 
edward kennedy dmass a member of the senate armed services 
committee

when american blood is shed americans rally 
around the flag remember the maine pearl harbor mayaguez 
grenada and the unsuccessful iran hostage rescue 
the doubts come later 
when the casualties are tolled and the troops have returned 
there may be rethinking but the immediate reaction of the american 
people is to be on the presidents side 
sure enough the first of the surveys a tally of viewers by 
cable news network on wednesday afternoon showed 91 percent 
supporting the american action in panama 
its the roman candle effect says stephen hess a brookings 
institution scholar 
it goes pop he says its an immediate burst into the 
air but like a roman candle it also tends to fall quickly in 
short its like a shot of adrenalin in the body politic 
if the panama operation had come close to an election hess 
says that roman candle burst of color in the air would have been 
very valuable 
military actions like the one in panama tend to wipe other 
troublesome issues off the front page 
its hard to keep two balls bouncing and its impossible with 
three balls says hess its the crisis of the moment like the 
childrens game where paper covers rock and rock breaks scissors 
this is the newest one in and will immediately take precedent 
bush for instance had been under fire for sending a delegation 
to china while the memories of tiananmen square were still fresh 
the latest development in that story came monday when the white 
house conceded it had made an earlier highlevel visit only a 
month after the chinese massacre of student demonstrators 
on wednesday with gunfire in panama city and smoke in the san 
miguelito neighborhood the troublesome subject of china had faded 
at least for a while 
in 1983 president reagan faced sharp questions when more than 
200 us marines and sailors were killed by a suicide terrorist 
bomb in beirut just two days later reagan sent troops to the 
caribbean island of grenada and elicited an outpouring of patriotic 
support 
a new york timescbs news poll taken after the bombing in beirut 
found substantially more americans approved of the us 
military presence there than a month earlier it also found that a 
slight majority approved of the grenada invasion 
reagans approval rating improved three points to 49 percent 
after those two events but the times noted that reagan thus far 
has not become the beneficiary of the sharp upturn of approval that 
presidents often enjoy after a foreign crisis 
jimmy carter not the most popular of recent presidents got a 
46 percent approval for his handling of the iran hostage crisis of 
19791980 in a newsweek poll taken after the aborted plan to rescue 
the americans seventyone percent said carter was right in the 
attempt only 18 percent disagreed 
when reagan sent american planes to bomb libya in 1986 a usa 
today poll found 84 percent of the american people would support 
another attack on that country if it were linked to another act of 
terrorism and more than twothirds of 534 adults surveyed in an 
nbc newswall street journal poll an hour after the attacks 
supported the strike 
gerald ford sent american sea air and ground forces to rescue 
39 us crewmen when their container ship mayaguez was captured by 
cambodians in 1975 the operation cost more lives than it saved 
but the presidents approval rating in a gallup poll rose by 11 
percent one of the sharpest gains ever recorded the previous 
high was richard nixons 17point rise in approval after the 
vietnam peace settlement in january 1973 
while the national adrenalin is flowing policymakers can 
announce news that otherwise might be controversial as proof 
secretary of state james a baker iii on wednesday notified 
congress that the us embassy in moscow will be torn down because 
it is riddled with listening devices put there by the soviets a 
new facility will cost an estimated 500 million 
at any other time that might have received critical reviews and 
widespread attention especially during a christmastime news 
drought with troops in panama its possible that hardly anyone 
will notice

when president bush launched military action 
against panamas gen manuel antonio noriega he cited the 
dictators declaration of war against the united states and attacks 
on us servicemen saying that was enough 
the decision won bush strong congressional support but a few 
congressional dissenters and some legal scholars say the legal 
underpinnings for the invasion are likely to become the subject of 
debate if the stay of us troops in panama stretches into weeks 
the most adamant critic was rep don edwards dcalif chairman 
of the house judiciary subcommittee on the constitution who 
dismissed administration arguments that the invasion was a matter 
of selfdefense 
there was no danger to our national security from this weak 
small country nor was the panama canal in real peril edwards 
said in a statement issued while he was traveling in budapest 
hungary 
michael glennon an international law professor at the 
university of californiadavis said the united nations charter 
gives countries the right to use force for selfdefense but the 
charter is clear that in order to exercise that right a countrys 
interests must come under actual attack 
threats and intimidation for example the unconfirmed 
intelligence reports cited by secretary of state james a baker iii 
of an impending noriega attack on us civilians are not 
sufficient grounds for action he said 
nor is the simple desire to oust a government inimical to us 
hopes for panama he added 
glennon who was counsel to the senate foreign relations 
committee during consideration of the panama canal treaties in 
1978 also said any claim that the treaties give the president 
additional authority for military action is incorrect 
the treaties make it abundantly clear that there is no 
authority to use armed force in hostilities that he the president 
did not have prior to ratification of the treaties he said 
justice department spokesman david runkel said the 
administration believed there was clearly legal authority under 
both us law and international law for wednesdays military 
action 
baker listed the un charter and that of the organization of 
american states as the legal basis for the action echoing bush he 
said noriegas declaration of war and the killing of an unarmed 
us marine this weekend gave us the right to take the steps 
necessary to remove this threat 
constantine menges a scholar at the american enterprise 
institute and formerly a latin american policymaker in the reagan 
white house said justification for the military move went well 
beyond events of the past few days in panama and included dozens 
and perhaps hundreds of incidents involving noriegas forces and 
us military personnel over the past few years 
its a matter of judgment and we elected bush to make that 
judgment said menges who was an architect of the 1983 invasion 
of grenada by us forces that ousted a leftist government its 
reasonable by any commonsense reading of the un charter he 
said 
that judgment was contested by jules lobel a law professor at 
the university of pittsburgh who also is associated with the center 
for constitutional rights a liberal new yorkbased civil liberties 
group 
id say its clearly illegal under the un charter and the oas 
charter lobel said the united states doesnt have the right 
to unilaterally decide to overthrow another government by the use 
of force nothing that the president said today or the secretary of 
state said would give the united states such a right 
a second issue raised by the invasion is that if the united 
states has the right to intervene in panama who within the 
american government holds the authority to commit forces the 
constitution makes the president commanderinchief of the 
military but gives congress the sole power to declare war 
as a purely technical constitutional matter the president 
does not have the authority to do what he did said david cole 
another attorney for the center 
several legal scholars agreed and predicted that if us troops 
remain in place for long congress will seek to invoke its 
prerogatives through the war powers act a postvietnam law enacted 
in 1973 that requires approval from capitol hill for deployment of 
force longer than 60 days 
the use of force will rapidly move into the domain of shared 
powers said glennon international law and domestic 
understandings allow the use of force to defend american citizens 
and members of the armed forces in an emergency situation once the 
emergency is over it is necessary to come to the congress and get 
approval

if the bush administration was counting on a 
quick surgical strike in panama officials can only conclude that 
their surprise military action is off to a rocky start 
while the wisdom of president bushs decision almost certainly 
will be debated at length in congress the massive american 
military force dispatched to panama faces daunting challenges as 
does the new usinstalled panamanian government as it seeks 
acceptance both at home and abroad 
seldom are military operations pulled off without a hitch and 
panama is no exception the invasion dealt the panamanian defense 
forces a severe blow but gen manuel antonio noriega remains on 
the loose the deaths of american soldiers tend to undercut a 
primary goal of the invasion protecting american lives in what 
bushs view was an increasingly unsafe environment in panama 
the 24000 us troops in panama still face the challenge of 
securing control over panama city they also may be confronted with 
the possibility that some americans may be held hostage and that 
armed pronoriega partisans may be able to engage in guerrilla 
warfare 
still the pentagon could take some comfort that organized 
resistance dissolved within hours after the operation began 
wednesday morning 
the acceptance both nationally and internationally of the 
government the united states helped install in panama remains 
uncertain the bush decision will be viewed positively over time if 
panamanians accept president guillermo endara as their leader and 
foreign governments show their approval by dispatching ambassadors 
to panama city 
bush is able to boast perhaps only one unqualified endorsement 
from a foreign leader great britains while the voices from 
latin america have been almost uniformly negative 
at the organization of american states the holdover pronoriega 
envoy was allowed to assume panamas seat wednesday the envoy sent 
by the newly installed government was rebuffed 
things have gone better for bush on the home front with the 
strong bipartisan congressional backing standing in sharp contrast 
to the widespread criticism bush endured following the recent 
disclosure of two highlevel trips to china 
a cable news network poll found public support for the action in 
excess of 90 percent 
and few could argue with the assessment of william j bennett 
the director of national drug control policy who said of noriega 
i think we can safely conclude that this ends his career as a 
drug trafficker hes not running drugs hes not running panama 
hes just running and thats good 
the administration hoped that by now noriega would have been 
hustled off to florida to face charges of narcotics trafficking 
but when us troops arrived where noriega was thought to be on 
wednesday he wasnt there the white house is offering a 1 
million bounty for him 
fairness requires that bushs critics take into account the 
consequences of doing nothing permitting noriega to continue what 
many agree has been a corrupt oneman rule in one of the 
hemispheres most strategically placed nations 
bush said he had no choice but to do what he did 
i took this action only after reaching the conclusion that 
every other avenue was closed and the lives of american citizens 
were in grave danger he said 
the wisdom of bushs decision will be discussed well into the 
winter months and beyond the risks and rewards of his decision are 
such that there may not even be a definitive judgment by the time 
according to the panama canal treaties panama is ready to assume 
full control of the waterway at midnight on dec 31 1999 10 
years and 10 days from now

dodging gunfire and patrols of both 
us troops and panamanian militia civilians took to the streets 
of a city in chaos and enthusiastically looted everything from 
jewelry stores to appliance shops 
a festive atmosphere reigned wednesday in commercial districts 
as civilians walked away with cameras tires mattresses even 
refrigerators and stoves carried by four or five people at a time 
as midday temperatures hovered at 99 degrees red cross teams 
scurried to pick up bodies from the predawn fighting before they 
decomposed in the heat 
men women and children emerged from the lowincome area of 
chorillo and old panama where combat was especially intense and 
walked to churches hospitals and schools in search of safety 
some cursed the us troops others gen manuel antonio noriega 
still others said they had faith in the strongmans powers of 
survival 
they the americans have been very tough with this invasion 
and the poorer people had to suffer most said juan about 25 
years old as he and a group of friends fended off the heat with 
cold beers a few yards from the old panama barracks destroyed by 
american troops 
if you keep standing in the middle of the street the 
gringos are going to arrest you juan warned a reporter about 
half a dozen american soldiers sat on a roadside patch of grass 
about 20 yards away 
the gis appeared nervous as they took a break to eat lunch 
a few blocks away a housewife of about 40 looked happily at the 
american troops there was no other way to get this bandit out 
she said of noriega 
a man of about 25 with unkempt hair spraypainted a nearby 
wall sovereignty without noriega 
armed toughs who support noriega took advantage of the chaos to 
commandeer cars often at gunpoint 
attack jets bombed and helicopters strafed a panamanian defense 
forces barracks on a hill in the san miguelito neighborhood to the 
northeast a stronghold of the dignity battalions the armed 
militia loyal to noriega 
one man who said he was a government employee stood at a 
newsstand near the foreign ministry building about 35 he refused 
to give his name but said he had confidence in noriega 
the man he said referring to the general by his nickname 
hes going to resist and things are going to get tough for the 
yankees he knows what hes doing 
at dozens of us army checkpoints those who wanted to pass had 
to get out of their cars and drop to their knees while their 
vehicles were thoroughly searched 
in one house where four reporters were hiding along with the 
residents the owner said he had nothing to fear until his wife 
noticed an 8by10 color photo of her husband as a student shaking 
hands with cuban president fidel castro 
she swiftly hid the photo in their bedroom

an abc news producer taken hostage in panama 
said he was held in a panamanian army intelligence headquarters 
where he was threatened constantly but released 
the producer robert campos said wednesday night he was 
abducted at the panama city marriott hotel with four other 
americans and that to his knowledge none of the others had been 
released cbs producer jon meyersohn and an american businessman 
staying at the marriott were separated from campos and a colombian 
national after their abduction campos said by telephone on 
abctvs nightline 
cbs said it had received no word of meyersohns whereabouts 
a group of us were on the mezzanine level of the hotel when we 
saw the dignity battalion soldiers entering the hotel from the 
lower level he said referring to gen manuel noriegas 
staunchly loyal paramilitary force 
we tried to run away by taking an elevator up to a higher 
floor and when the elevator doors opened two soldiers leveled

would kill us if we did they laid us on the floor and took us off

most of the 150 captured panamanians 
being held in an automobile storage lot were cooperating as us 
military officers tried to determine which of them were civilians 
caught up in combat and which were pows 
the prisoners made a forlornlooking group wednesday as they 
stood in the lot under a broiling sun some prisoners wore military 
fatigues others wore casual civilian clothes such as tshirts and 
shorts most were shirtless 
staff sgt phillip salcido of las cruces nm said some were 
in fact civilians caught up in combat and officers were 
questioning them to determine who could be released 
the lot holding brandnew japanese and korean cars was 
surrounded by razorsharp concertina wire 
though salcido said most prisoners were cooperating some 
squabbled over cooperating with their questioners an mp broke up 
one apparent fight that salcido said might have been planned as a 
diversion for an attack on guards 
in a remark he took back immediately salcido quipped that a 
prisoner cooperates or accidents happen 
one prisoner called out to another in spanish speak spanish

a former paramount pictures executive said 
eddie murphy was told in 1983 about an art buchwald script idea for 
murphy to play an african king visiting america 
we had just made a new deal with eddie to make four or five 
more movies david kirkpatrick recalled wednesday at the trial of 
buchwalds 5 million lawsuit against paramount the purpose of 
the meeting was to tell him what was ahead for him 
he said murphy listened politely to several script ideas 
including the one by buchwald then titled king for a day he 
didnt react negatively to king for a day but he didnt jump up 
and down about any of the projects said kirkpatrick 
later he said murphys manager bob wachs read five or 10 
pages of a script written from buchwalds treatment and did not 
like the script 
buchwald the pulitzer prizewinning columnist claims paramount 
stole his idea for murphys hit movie coming to america 
on crossexamination by paramount lawyer robert draper 
kirkpatrick sought to explain why he and other executives generated 
a blizzard of memos in 1983 and 1984 about the anticipated 
production of king for a day 
he said a new studio chief ned tanen had arrived recently and 
the memos were intended to show tanen that projects were in the 
works for murphy 
he said the proposals included plans for murphy to play a 
priest a prisoner a detective a witch doctor and a schizophrenic 
with 10 personalities 
kirkpatrick chief of production at walt disney studios 
identified dozens of memos written in 1983 and 1984 that included 
the story idea entitled king for a day among the top projects 
in the works for murphy and director john landis 
in one 1984 memo kirkpatrick said another executive had circled 
the king for a day entry and scribbled the word great 
but later that year paramount dropped the idea which involved 
an african prince coming to america in search of a bride three 
years later paramount produced coming to america starring 
murphy and directed by landis the story involved an african prince 
who comes to america in search of a bride 
the film one of murphys biggest hits grossed more than 300 
million 
studio officials say there are no similarities between 
buchwalds script idea and coming to america they contend that 
murphy and his costar arsenio hall conceived the idea and 
created a series of humorous incidents never mentioned by buchwald

us ambassador arthur davis 
returned to panama after a sevenmonth absence wednesday and 
declared that neighboring latin american leaders would deep 
down be pleased that us troops ousted gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
but he warned that life in panama would remain dangerous as 
noriega loyalists retaliate 
davis left panama the day after noriega voided elections which 
most observers say he lost to opposition candidates now installed 
by the us action however other latin american countries have 
sharply criticized the united states and have refused to accept the 
new leadership in panama so far 
davis said the position of those leaders was a reflection of 
their many years supporting noninterventionist treatment of their 
region but he said privately they had to be pleased 
i think that deep down that theyre glad to get rid of this 
man he told a heavily guarded press conference at howard air 
base only a pool of reporters from washington was allowed to 
attend 
he expressed concern that noriega supporters would seek revenge 
i think that this is a very difficult time for security 
because of retaliation there will be retaliation davis said 
the returning ambassador said he was bringing an economic 
recovery plan for discussion with panamas new leaders but made no 
promise of us aid except to point out that 700 million in assets 
would be returned as a result of president bushs decision to lift 
economic sanctions

while the fbi investigates last weeks 
bombing death of a federal judge in alabama investigators here are 
still puzzling over the mysterious 1987 slayings of a biloxi judge 
and his wife 
the investigation has unearthed links among the dixie mafia an 
organized crime group that once flourished on mississippis 
golden gulf coast a sex and extortion ring allegedly run from 
a louisiana prison the mayor of this coastal city and a purported 
hitman sitting in a georgia jail 
but while there are many pieces to the puzzle few of them fit 
together 
a federal grand jury has spent months investigating the deaths 
of circuit judge vincent sherry 58 and his wife former biloxi 
councilwoman margaret sherry 57 so far there have been no 
indictments 
the sherrys were shot to death sept 14 1987 in their home 
the judge was shot three times in the face and his wife four times 
in the head authorities said the same 22caliber pistol was used 
their bodies were discovered two days later by vincent sherrys 
former law partner peter halat who has since become mayor of 
biloxi and has been implicated in the crime 
halat worked with sherry until sherry was appointed judge in 
1986 
louisiana prison inmate bobby joe fabian a convicted murderer 
has said halat attended a 1987 meeting at the louisiana state 
penitentiary at angola in which the killings were plotted halat 
angrily denied the accusations last august saying he wasnt at the 
prison when the meeting allegedly took place 
fabian claims the sherrys were killed because inmates believed 
the judge kept about 400000 from an extortion scam that ran ads 
in homosexual magazines and newspapers 
respondents to the ads were told their friend was getting 
out of the louisiana prison and needed money for airfare to meet 
them authorities claim hundreds of thousands were taken in the 
scheme 
an alleged member of the dixie mafia kirksey mccord nix jr 
has been indicted in the scam fabian claims that nix who is 
serving a life sentence for killing a new orleans grocer was a 
party to the murder plot 
nix 46 said recently that hed take a lie detector test as 
long as his accusers and investigators would do the same 
halat said he represented nix for nearly 10 years but severed 
his ties in may 1988 he said he wouldnt comment further and 
take the chance of compromising the ongoing investigation 
number one i want the case solved number two after it is 
solved i dont want anything to be tainted by publicity halat 
said in an interview 
federal and state officials also are keeping mum 
all i can tell you is that weve been trying to hold the press 
down so we can do the job the way it ought to be done said us 
attorney george phillips 
another person who has been linked to the case is john elbert

others contend the hit on the sherrys was ordered by enemies the

the documentation comes from investigations by private investigator

protesters took to the streets in four us cities to denounce 
the invasion of panama but many of them encountered jeers and 
unscientific surveys showed americans overwhelmingly in favor of it 
scholars on central america were mixed in their reactions 
its obvious that we dont want democracy we want client 
states said john donaghy a member of the central american 
solidarity association which organized a rally wednesday on boston 
common 
about 100 people braved 29degree temperatures and stiff winds 
to attend the demonstration against the predawn us raid to 
capture gen manuel noriega who faces drug charges in florida 
about 25 people from the rhode island central america network 
picketed the federal courthouse in providence on wednesday evening 
and about 70 demonstrators held a candlelight vigil in baltimore 
kathy schaafsma a demonstrator in baltimore said she military 
action was illegal and the newly installed government of elected 
president guillermo endara was a puppet government that will 
ensure us control of the panama canal 
about 200 people gathered in front of a us armed services 
recruiting center in new york citys times square before beginning 
to march chanting slogans such as us out of panama 
as they marched up the avenue of the americas they were jeered 
by numerous passersby 
i say theyre confused said one passerby frankie ambrosia 
i think this is more than a political thing he said of the 
us intervention this was an antidrug thing 
when the protesters began chanting in rockefeller center many 
tourists there to view the giant christmas tree at the skating rink 
began booing at them 
besides the boos other barometers bore out strong support for 
the military strike 
cable news network asked viewers to call one of two special 900 
numbers to indicate whether they support or oppose the us action 
in panama 
the network said early today that 91 percent of more than 
100000 viewers phoning in supported us intervention and 9 
percent opposed it 
radio programs that sought opinions from listeners also found 
that most callers supported president bushs decision 
cincinnati radio station wlw also received more than 1000 calls 
during a 2hour telephone survey with 844 supporting the invasion 
and 233 opposing it 
ann twinam a latin american historian at the university of 
cincinnati said the perception of the invasion will be different 
from criticism of other us intervention in latin america 
normally we would suspect universal condemnation but the 
extent of the drug trade by panama could alter that she said 
she said panamanians did not want to settle the countrys 
problem themselves people werent really willing to take to the 
streets people really wanted him gone but they werent willing to 
do it she said 
but carlos munoz associate professor of ethnic studies at the 
university of california berkeley called the move the most 
serious policy blunder since vietnam 
i see a vietnam war in the making he said i hope to god 
im wrong in this but i fear the worst 
one reason noriega has been so difficult to remove from power 
munoz said is the widespread support for him in panama 
rightly or wrongly he has been a very respected leader in 
that country munoz said i dont like to see dictatorships 
but the government the united states is putting in place does not 
have the support of the panamanian people 
in jacksonville nc home of camp lejeune many residents 
approved of the strike 
they the troops should have gone in when they had the 
coup harold schaefer a retired marine said of octobers failed 
attempt by panamanian officers to overthrow noriega theyre 
doing the right thing 
william little another retired marine said bush had better 
not pull out until they hang him by the neck here in the us 
bush has more guts than i gave him credit for but id like to see 
old harry truman in there now 
still others were upset by the timing 
i question the judgment of the president in sending these 
young men into battle this close to christmas and having them 
giftwrapped in body bags said victor carucci of east amherst 
ny

a bomb damaged the us embassy in 
bolivia nicaraguan troops went on alert and thousands of cubans 
reportedly protested in havana as most of latin america reacted 
angrily to the invasion of panama 
peru withdrew its us ambassador and the organization of 
american states met in emergency session wednesday following the 
predawn mililtary assault aimed at deposing and seizing panamanian 
strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
the oas refused to recognize the new usinstalled governments 
representative and instead considered a resolution condemning the 
us action 
el salvadors usbacked government was the only one in latin 
american to clearly support the move 
in la paz the bomb went off around 830 pm wednesday 
destroying windows at the embassy and surrounding offices no 
injuries were reported 
police at the scene said there were no suspects but the armed 
liberation front of zarate willka a radical leftist group claimed 
responsibility 
death to the yankee invader our hatred is unplacable and the 
war will be until death the group said in a statement released 
just after the bombing we are fighting against aggression and 
for the sovereignty of our people 
the group has been accused of killing two mormon missionaries 
from the united states in may and has been linked to an attempt to 
kill thenus secretary of state george shultz during an august 
1988 visit 
perus president alan garcia said he was pulling his 
ambassador from washington in protest he said a drug summit 
scheduled for feb 15 with bush and other latin american presidents 
in cartagena colombia should be postponed as a result of the 
invasion 
venezuela also criticized the move but said in a communique 
that lack of an effective and firm response by latin american 
nations to human rights violations and constitutional norms by 
panamas government had made it necessary 
in nicaragua president daniel ortega said the invasion 
threatened his central american country and placed troops on 
maximum alert sovietbuilt tanks rumbled through managua at least 
20 large howitzers were positioned in the capital and red beret 
special forces went to the international airport 
in addition to constituting a flagrant trampling of the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of panama it is a threat to 
the peace and security of all latin america central america and 
especially constitutes a serious threat to nicaragua ortega said 
in a communique read on voice of nicaragua radio 
thousands of cubans protested the invasion by rallying outside 
the havana building that houses the us interests section the 
official cuban news agency prensa latina said the united states 
has no embassy in havana 
fidel castros government called on the world to unite in 
denouncing the united states the agency said 
president jose sarney of brazil said in a television interview 
that the invasion was a step backward in international 
relations 
argentina offered aid to panamanians and said it truly 
deplores what is happening it called for immediate removal of 
the american troops but also described noriega as an obstacle to 
democracy 
chile mexico uruguay and ecuador also deplored the us move 
colombia did not directly comment on the invasian but enrique 
pennalosa its united nations ambassador who also chairs the un 
security council said colombia as a matter of principle 
rejects any armed intervention against a sovereign country 
el salvadors government said the united states was using its 
legitimate right of defense 
this type of actions could permit the panamanian people to 
identify with a democratic process to reestablish an elected 
government said vice president francisco merino 
honduras appeared to give qualified support to the us move 
saying its government laments the declaration of a state of war 
in panama and the violent acts taken against american military and 
civilians 
honduras equally laments that the us government saw it 
necessary to take military action moving away from the principle 
of nonintervention as an extreme measure to guarantee the 
security of thousands of its citizens residing in panama the 
foreign ministry statement added 
costa rican foreign minister rodrigo madrigal said in a 
statement that his country regretted the us use of force to 
bring about an end to the crisis caused by the despotic 
government of gen noriega but hopes that peace returns to 
panama with a quick restoration of a democratic government

the ice block on the mississippi river has 
created a traffic jam of 1000 barges giving some pilots time to 
catch up on their reading 
right now its southern outdoors roy east said by cb 
radio wednesday from his tugboat tied up with 22 barges on an 
island in the icy river just north of alton mostly its just sit 
up here and hurry up and wait 
a 200mile stretch of the mississippi from alton just north of 
st louis down to cairo in southern illinois was closed 
indefinitely to barge traffic monday night by the coast guard 
because ice and low water had combined to make navigation unsafe 
the shutdown comes at the slowest time of year for barge traffic 
on the river but it still worries shipping officials who fear 
damage to barges stuck in and around the ice and mounting costs of 
idled towboats 
up to 1000 barges are sidelined in the st louis harbor a 
20mile section of the river below a huge ice bridge that has 
formed just north of the city at the confluence of the missouri 
river according to the coast guard other barges are idled 
elsewhere on the river 
tom garrett the captain of the towboat illini docked at alton 
said he had rarely seen such a build up at the confluence 
usually that missouri river keeps everything pretty clear 
garrett said i figure its going to last a long time because 
were not going to get any hot water im sure its going to be bad 
conditions until spring 
charles norman president of the norman brothers inc barge 
company agreed 
its not fun but its kind of amazing to watch nature do its 
thing he said 
coast guard petty officer dean jones said there was no way to 
determine when the river could reopen he said it depended on when 
temperatures warmed the ice melted and the water level rose 
on wednesday st louis temperature ranged from 3 to 20 
degrees the mississippi was 8 to 10 feet below normal 
jones said the river levels were lower than any time since 1940 
the last time the river was closed because of ice was in january 
1977 when barge traffic was restricted for about a week he said 
lt michael rand of the coast guards st louis marine safety 
office said a few towboats have been allowed to travel below st 
louis but no traffic can get through the chunky ice bridge at the 
missourimississippi confluence 
barge operators in the st louis harbor have doubled up on their 
lines and put out shear barges which are barges placed at an angle 
to the shore above each fleet to ward off any large dangerous 
chunks of ice that may break off the bridge 
the ice bridge extends about two miles on the mississippi and 
about 14 miles back on the missouri river rand said he said it 
had formed because there was little current from the missouri to 
keep it clear due to record low water levels 
on wednesday officials considered breaking up the jam with 
dynamite but with subzero temperatures expected for the next 
several days ice would simply reform 
the cold weathers coming and it will only make more ice so 
we dont know whats going to happen rand said 
back in alton roy east had managed to pilot his margaret o 
from cairo to alton before the river was closed but he said the 
ohio river co is sidelining his boat because of ice problems 
farther upstream on the illinois river 
east interviewed by cb radio said he was hauling coal and 
scrap iron 
it costs the company a lot of money i imagine he said 
you dont make any when youre sitting here

million shares down from wednesdays 1 billion

a judges new weapon in the war against 
deadbeat dads in divorce cases has led a fathers group to demand 
equal time against mothers who violate visitation rights 
family court judge stephen levin spent nearly 7000 in court 
funds for a fullpage ad last week in the philadelphia daily news 
listing 136 fathers and six mothers accused of ignoring bench 
warrants for more than a year mostly for failing to pay child 
support he warned they would go to jail if they did not respond 
immediately 
sixty delinquent fathers and two mothers did although they were 
angry about the unexpected and unwanted publicity 
they said they were petrified angry humiliated and several 
told me they were even afraid to show their face on the street 
levin said 
while mothers congratulated the judge for his innovative 
approach it irritated a group called fathers and children 
equality which claims family court caters far too much to mothers 
and takes too long to handle child visitation violations 
why doesnt he do it to the women who are purposely keeping 
their children from their fathers asked benjamin manis who has 
experienced problems with his former wife over their 4yearold 
we dont get equal rights in family court 
the judge said he recognized the validity of complaints over 
visitation rights but said he was elated at the results of the ad 
we got an immediate response and we sent a strong message to 
others delinquent in child support that if you dont want your name 
in the paper you better pay up he said 
levin said he would also try to address the visitation problem 
custody is difficult to deal with and sometimes fathers 
wont pay support because the mothers wont let them see the 
children the judge said 
and fathers are resentful because courts dont move as swiftly 
to help them as they do for mothers seeking support in the middle 
unfortunately are the kids and we are there to make sure they are 
taken care of 
what about those 76 fathers and four mothers who have ignored 
the ad 
i am going to get sheriffs deputies to arrest them and i am 
going to put them in prison levin said i am not bluffing

an agreement billed as the nations first common 
market for educators has been signed by officials in seven states 
seeking to draw talented teachers to the northeast 
this must be the most attractive section of the country for 
teachers if we want to attract the kind of talent we are used to in 
new england harold raynolds jr commissioner of education in 
massachusetts said wednesday after the agreement was signed during 
a conference here 
the pact which goes into effect april 1 1990 will loosen the 
certification restrictions that prohibit teachers from moving 
across state lines 
under the plan teachers with a northeast regional credential 
who move within the region would have two years to fulfill any 
unmet requirements for certification in their new state of 
residence 
the states in the agreement are massachusetts vermont rhode 
island new hampshire maine connecticut and new york 
new jersey pennsylvania delaware maryland and the district of 
columbia also were making overtures to join the northeast compact 
said anne newton a director for the regional laboratory a 
federally funded educational research group which helped to develop 
the agreement with the northeast common market project california 
also was watching the experiment closely she said 
teacher representatives heralded the agreement as one more step 
toward professionalizing education 
its very exciting and very forwardthinking said rosanne 
bacon president of the 68000member massachusetts teachers 
association 
bacon said the agreement would among other things encourage 
more competitive salaries for teachers who could move to states 
which offered them more money or benefits 
were going to have an incredible interest in people moving 
from one area into an area where they are truly needed and the 
market will obviously have to reflect that with higher salaries 
said bacon who teaches at a public high school 
with 20 years teaching experience and two masters degrees 
bacon said she could earn 24000 more a year if she worked 30 
miles away in connecticut 
raynolds and top educators in other states insisted they were 
interested in improving teaching in the region not just in their 
state 
were trying to think and act regionally said richard p 
mills vermonts education commissioner 
not all seven states embraced the agreement wholeheartedly 
maine has agreed to allow teachers to fulfill their requirements in 
one year instead of two 
connecticut agreed to accept outofstate teachers under the 
terms of the agreement only in vocational classes

the nations most sophisticated hospitals which 
invest in the latest hightech equipment and the besttrained 
doctors and nurses do the best job of saving sick peoples lives 
a study today concludes 
our findings suggest that the resources utilized in hospitals 
may have an impact on mortality said dr arthur j hartz who 
directed the study 
he said the results may surprise many doctors who often feel 
that differences between hospitals are relatively unimportant in 
patients survival 
the research found that hospitals are mostly likely to save 
lives when a large proportion of their doctors are certified by 
specialty boards and their nurses have rn degrees the most 
successful hospitals also tend to have large payrolls high 
occupancy rates and the most technologically advanced equipment 
the study found that the lowest death rates are in private 
teaching hospitals the medical centers that train young doctors 
the highest rates were in osteopathic public or profitmaking 
hospitals 
all of our findings have the same possible explanation they 
reflect differences in quality said hartz a physician at the 
medical college of wisconsin 
the study based on federal statistics is the largest to 
attempt to settle a longrunning debate over whether forprofit 
hospitals are as good as their nonprofit counterparts while at 
least two smaller studies have found no difference the latest one 
suggests that nonprofit hospitals have an advantage 
private nonprofit hospitals had 114 deaths for every 1000 
patients by contrast the forprofit hospitals had 121 deaths 
it could be that the physicians and nurses in the forprofit 
hospitals because of administrative pressures deal with patients 
in such a way that is detrimental to their health said dr 
alfred a rimm a coauthor of the study 
the study found that public hospitals such as city and county 
hospitals averaged 120 deaths per 1000 patients the highest 
death rate in all the categories studied was osteopathic hospitals 
which had 129 deaths 
the best record was for private nonosteopathic teaching 
hospitals which train interns and residents after medical school 
they had 108 deaths per 1000 patients 
i wouldnt go to anything but a hightech university 
hospital commented rimm 
the study was based on 1986 data gathered on 3100 of the 
nations nearly 6000 hospitals by the health care financing 
adminstration the agencys latest figures released wednesday 
showed that 34 percent of all hospitals had higherthanexpected 
death rates in 1988 
the wisconsin researchers and coauthors from the health care 
administration used the figures to see how mortality rates differed 
between various categories of hospitals they adjusted the numbers 
to reflect differences in the severity of illness of patients 
admitted to the hospitals the results were published in todays 
issue of new england journal of medicine 
michael bromberg head of the federation of american health 
systems which represents forprofit hospitals said the research 
was flawed 
this study represents an unfair comparison of hospitals that 
are not alike he said a small rural hospital that is 
forprofit is treated the same way as a big notforprofit teaching 
hospital with lots of doctors and lots of equipment for the purpose 
of determining mortality there is no way you can make such a 
comparison and have it mean anything 
martin wall senior vice president of the american osteopathic 
hospital association noted that the nations 160 osteophatic 
hospitals fit into several of the other categories studied 
including forprofit and nonprofit teaching and nonteaching 
making our hospitals a separate category is inappropriate 
he said 
doctors of osteopathy prescribe drugs perform surgery and 
receive the same training as medical doctors they also believe 
that disturbances of muscles and bones can underly disease and 
perform massage and other manipulation as part of their treatment

central american natives living in the united 
states reacted to the us military invasion of panama with 
feelings from ecstatic relief to condemnation 
about 200 members of miamis panamanian exile community 
celebrated the us action to oust gen manuel antonio noriega 
after a prayer vigil in the citys coconut grove section 
viva bush he brought down noriega he brought down the rat 
they chanted unfurling a 15foot panamanian flag 
im here to thank the lord for the american invasion said 
one panamanian at the gathering jeanne friend because thats 
what i really wanted for the americans to come in and take hold 
of noriega 
but in los angeles a native of el salvador denounced the 
invasion 
the time has long passed when the united states had to be the 
police force for south america said mario rivas spokesman for 
our lady queen of angels church my reaction is united states 
get out of panama let panamanians work the situation out for 
themselves 
rivas a salvadoran refugee who came to the united states eight 
years ago said several panamanian refugees told him they were 
outraged by the attack 
i hope the invasion fails because its imperial thirst to 
conquer foreign lands rivas said thats not democracy lets 
practice democratic ways and means 
in miami ivan chacon who was beaten by noriega supporters in 
attacks on opposition candidates after panamas elections in may 
had a different view he said us intervention was the only way to 
bring democracy to his homeland 
the people couldnt bring noriega down waving little white 
handkerchiefs chacon said 
aurelio barria who last year headed the antinoriega opposition 
until he was forced into exile in miami said panamanians would 
blame noriega for the bloodshed not the united states 
its a mixed feeling we have been fighting so long through 
nonviolent ways to get noriega out barria said but he just 
became a psychopath he went a few steps beyond the limit 
we arent happy that our country has been invaded said 
roberto dominguez the former panamanian counsul in miami but it 
is an action to get rid of someone who has held our country 
hostage 
at the rally susana toral wept with joy 
i cry for not being there she said i left panama because 
i was afraid but i dont want to live here i want to return to my 
panama 
luis endara a cousin of panamas new president guillermo 
endara said the longing to return home remains great among the 
estimated 5000 to 7000 members of miamis panamanian community 
we will probably see for the first time an emigration back to 
a country that has been liberated endara said 
adela bonilla de giroldi widow of maj moises giroldi the 
leader of a failed panamanian military coup against noriega on oct 
3 said her feelings were mixed her husband was killed after 
troops loyal to the general rallied some accounts said noriega 
shot giroldi 
i am glad that my husband is dead mrs giroldi said 
because if he had been there today i am sure he would have died 
defending his barracks 
the us intervention is not the best way but it had to be 
done she said 
in texas the nations largest hispanic rights organization came 
out strongly in favor of the us military strike 
we stand squarely behind our commander in chief on this 
issue said jose garcia de lara president of the san 
antoniobased league of united latin american citizens what 
were doing here is getting rid of a hooligan that is causing great 
turmoil in our hemisphere

a plan in britain to give residency rights to 
225000 people from hong kong received mixed reviews today with 
some arguing it would be too narrow to be of much help to the 
colony before china takes over in 1997 
a little that will not go very far read the headline over 
the hong kong standard newspapers editorial on the package 
the nationality plan announced wednesday by british foreign 
secretary douglas hurd is designed to prevent 50000 key hong kong 
residents and their families from emigrating before the colony 
reverts to china 
he argued that giving important people in the civil service 
business and the professions the right to live in britain was 
essential to persuade them to not join the brain drain of top 
whitecollar workers leaving because of concern over impending 
communist chinese rule 
chinas promise that hong kong can maintain its capitalist 
system for 50 years and enjoy a high degree of autonomy has met 
with widespread skepticism here particularly after the bloody 
suppression of spring prodemocracy protests in beijing 
hong kongs governor sir david wilson praised the plan as 
helping create the sort of stability and the reassurances for a 
substantial number of people which we have been looking for 
honor hong kong a group of top business leaders formed to press 
for right of residency in britain also welcomed the package as 
encouraging key whitecollar staff to remain in the territory 
we argued for more we should have been given more but this 
figure we believe is a basis on which to rebuild confidence in 
our economy said simon murray the groups chairman 
murray noted that a private study released last week estimated 
as many as 315000 key workers were essential to maintaining hong 
kongs vibrant economy 
community leaders on the colonys legislative council who have 
long argued that the right of residency should be granted to all 
325 million hong kong chinese eligible for british passports vowed 
to pressure london to broaden the program 
some expressed worries the plan will divide the community as 
only 4 percent of the colonys 57 million people will qualify 
fears also were voiced that the offer will not stop the brain drain 
the lobbying group british citizens for hong kong issued a 
statement saying the plan will have no effect in stemming the 
outflow and is a divisive and dishonorable gesture of dismissal 
by britain 
wonghyo vice chairman of the hong kong chinese civil servants 
association was quoted by the standard as saying the package was 
inadequate to keep up morale and retain staff 
although the xinhua news agency chinas official representative 
in the colony refused to comment on the package a newspaper that 
often reflects beijings thinking was critical of the plan 
the chineselanguage wen wei po argued that the package showed 
britain was only concerned with maintaining the territorys 
prosperity until 1997 
if the society is divided into two types of people who have 
different futures and benefits it would be very difficult for them 
to unite and live through the transitional period and the years 
after the paper said in an editorial 
to solve hong kongs confidence crisis hong kong people 
should develop trust in themselves and put into effect the one 
country two systems policy china has promised for the territory 
it said

gen manuel noriego would be treated as any other 
criminal defendant no more no less said the federal judge 
handling the ousted panamanian leaders drug trial 
but 80 miles to the north in west palm beach another federal 
judge on wednesday postponed the cocaine importation trial of three 
men after agreeing with defense attorneys contention that the trio 
could not receive a fair trial because of the us military action 
in panama 
noriega and 16 associates face federal drugtrafficking 
indictments returned last year by grand juries in miami and tampa 
if general noriega is apprehended and brought here for 
trial us district judge william m hoeveler said wednesday 
he would be given the same treatment as any other person accused 
of a crime no more no less 
all his rights will be protected the miami trial judge said 
in the february 1988 miami indictment against noriega 
in west palm beach judge james c paine postponed the trial of 
two us citizens and a colombian national charged with smuggling 
more than 25 pounds of cocaine into south florida 
paine agreed with defense arguments that accused drug 
traffickers cannot receive a fair trial when the united states has 
just invaded a country to apprehend someone accused of the same 
crime 
paine said it might be difficult if not impossible to get a 
jury seated that would give the three a fair trial 
noriega remained at large today the united states has issued a 
1 million reward for information leading to his arrest if he is 
caught federal officials confirmed that extremely tight security 
has been included in plans drawn up to handle his arrival 
officials spoke on the condition of anonymity 
after being flown to an unspecified military base in south 
florida noriega would be transferred to a secure location to 
await the miami trial according to an official for the us 
marshals service 
two noriega attorneys in miami said if their client was 
cornered he would rather die than surrender 
hes a fighter said miami attorney raymond takiff the 
attorney said he last spoke with noriega monday evening and 
remained in touch with the generals aides on wednesday 
attorney frank rubino agreed 
the general is alive well and somewhere in panama rubino 
said and he is on top of the situation as far as leading his 
forces 
noriega is charged in the indictments with accepting bribes of 
10 million from drug traffickers of colombias medellin cartel to 
protect smugglers and cocaine shipments launder cash and supply 
drug laboratories 
if convicted he faces up to 145 years in prison and more than 
11 million in fines

two former jim bakker associates accused 
of lying to a grand jury have been released on 25000 bond pending 
their trials 
evangelist john wesley fletcher whose introduction of jessica 
hahn to bakker led to the scandal that destroyed the television 
ministry and the rev sam johnson former pastor of the heritage 
church at ptl were both released following a brief hearing 
wednesday 
fletcher is accused of lying to a grand jury about why he 
introduced ms hahn to bakker in 1980 and johnson is accused of 
lying to the same grand jury about the source of a 10000 loan he 
made to one of bakkers aides that eventually was given to ms hahn 
johnsons arraignment was scheduled for jan 16 
fletcher appeared without an attorney before us magistrate 
paul taylor who imposed several conditions for his release 
including surrendering his passport and refraining from the use of 
alcohol and narcotics 
fletcher recently was arrested twice in one night in durham on 
charges of driving while impaired 
my life has been in such shambles these past three years 
fletcher said as he left the federal courthouse in downtown 
charlotte 
taylor said he would appoint counsel for fletcher after the 
evangelist told the magistrate i have nothing sir except the 
clothes on my back 
taylor did not schedule fletchers arraignment because he said 
it will take about a week to appoint counsel 
johnson faces five years in prison and a 250000 fine for each 
of 12 perjury counts fletcher could face the same sentence on one 
perjury count

a federal jury convicted an alabama 
state legislator of taking money to influence legislation but 
acquitted two others of accepting bribes from a union official 
after almost three days of deliberations jurors on wednesday 
found rep pat davis guilty of four counts and innocent of four 
others reps john rogers and jim wright were found innocent on two 
counts each all three are democrats 
mrs davis refused to comment after the verdict and friends 
rushed her away from the federal courthouse 
but rogers was jubilant after the verdict yes there is a 
santa claus its the best christmas present in my life he said 
the lawmaker said he would return immediately to work in the 
legislature which is meeting in special session 
wright declined to comment after being acquitted 
so far this year six jefferson county legislators have been 
indicted but five have been acquitted a jury at montgomery 
several weeks ago acquitted three other legislators of extortion 
charges in connection with an attempt to establish a dog track 
us district judge james hancock set sentencing for mrs davis 
on jan 25 the maximum possible penalty is 20 years and 250000 
on each of the four counts 
the jury convicted her of taking 12000 from a union official 
1200 for her hotel expenses during legislative sessions in 
montgomery 1000 in appreciation money and 5000 to 
reintroduce a failed coal bill 
mrs davis as were rogers and wright was acquitted of a 
conspiracy count and she was cleared of charges she took 400 to 
pay for a barbecue 500 as a christmas gift and 500 in 
fundraising money 
rogers and wright also were acquitted of charges they accepted 
5000 payments 
the government contended the three lawmakers accepted about 
30000 for their support of a bill that would have required 
alabama utilities and state agencies to buy coal mined within the 
state 
a united mine workers union official john w stewart testified 
that mrs davis solicited a bribe from him stewart became an fbi 
informant and he said set up various meetings with the lawmakers 
paying them with money provided by the fbi in its sting operation

a chinese man jailed after he and his 
pregnant wife entered the united states illegally to flee a forced 
abortion in china hopes a presidential order will bring him freedom 
li jin lins case is one of the first in the nation to test 
president bushs directive that says fear of forced sterilization 
or abortion can be considered as grounds for granting an alien 
political asylum 
the directive though not specifically for chinese was part of 
bushs nov 30 order allowing many chinese citizens to remain in 
the united states indefinitely after the massacre of prodemocracy 
demonstrators in beijing 
li 37 and his wife wang sai zhen fled their hometown of 
fuzhou after she became pregnant with the couples second child 
ms wang had been forced to have several abortions after the 
birth of her first daughter now 10 because chinese law limits 
most families to one child she feared for her health if forced to 
undergo another said patrick wh wesp lis lawyer the daughter 
remains in china with relatives 
the lis entered the united states from canada last march but 
the us immigration and naturalization service caught them in 
albany and returned li 37 to canada ms wang whose age was 
unavailable was allowed to remain because of her advanced 
pregnancy and gave birth to a girl in new york city 
li and his nephew chun kong cheung tried once more to get into 
the united states but border officers found them in the back of a 
tractortrailer at the peace bridge on oct 14 wesp said 
the couple now fears harassment and worse if they should be 
returned to china and their daughter could suffer even though she 
is a us citizen by virtue of her birth here said kathleen rimar 
a lawyer representing them before the ins 
our research indicates that individuals who have had two 
children face sterilization in china rimar said the child 
would never have any advantages in her life she would be cut out 
of schooling any chance at a job 
she said bushs directive doesnt grant people asylum but it 
gives them a better shot if they can prove they would be forced to 
abort or face sterilization she added that it should apply even 
though the lis were caught before the order was issued 
john j ingham acting district director of the ins said the 
lis are the first refugees in the buffalo area to claim asylum 
because of their countrys familyplanning laws rimar and wesp 
said that as far as they know it is the first such case in the 
country 
li and his nephew are in jail awaiting trial on criminal charges 
of conspiracy to enter the united states illegally ingham said 
he said the family should have requested political asylum at the 
border but rimar said the lis neither speak english nor understand 
immigration law 
they dont even know the word asylum rimar said

the communist party voted today to 
immediately disband the despised paramilitary peoples militia in 
another concession to the countrys increasingly powerful 
prodemocracy movement 
the delegates vote came at a special party congress aimed at 
shoring up the partys plummeting popularity the staterun news 
agency ctk reported 
the paramilitary force which had been under the direct control 
of the party was disarmed on dec 3 and its weapons stored in army 
warehouses 
the militia last acted in january when it helped riot police 
suppress a weeklong series of demonstrations in prague 
disbanding the militia was among the earliest demands of the 
prodemocracy movement which began rallying hundreds of thousands 
of czechoslovaks last month and has since won broad reforms from 
the party and government 
delegates were expected to elect a new central committee by the 
close of the congress late today 
falling in line with the reform movement in eastern europe 
czechoslovakias communist party on wednesday replaced its top 
leaders with men who accept that the party will no longer enjoy 
unquestioned supremacy 
delegates at the special party congress also apologized for the 
harsh repression of the past today they were expected to approve 
a program aimed at bringing democratic socialism to czechoslovakia 
on wednesday the delegates sent a clear message that they want 
a clean break with the hardline policies of the past by dumping 
party boss karel urbanek he had served less than a month in the 
post 
the delegates gave the job to former premier ladislav adamec 
who arranged the first official negotiations with opposition leader 
vaclav havel 
urbanek who served less than a month was viewed as too closely 
associated with the hardline leadership that was ousted by the 
gentle revolution that has brought to an end four decades of 
oneparty tyranny 
the delegates also elected politburo member vasil mohorita first 
secretary mohorita was a key negotiator in talks with the 
opposition that led to the nations first noncommunist dominated 
government in 41 years 
the chairmanship the more powerful of the two posts is 
responsible for dealings with other political forces which are 
expected to increase as the country moves toward its first free 
elections in 43 years 
they are to be held in june or july 
im aware things wont be easy in the future adamec told 
the delegates in his acceptance speech 
he said he took the job out of feelings of responsibility for 
correcting the mistakes of the past and he told the 1500 
delegates that their principal task was to not let the party 
disintegrate 
the delegates also passed a resolution apologizing for harsh 
policies after the warsaw pact invasion that crushed the 1968 
prague spring reforms 
we apologize to our youth and all citizens afflicted by 
unjustified repression the resolution said 
last month the party reevaluated its stance on the period 
condemning the sovietled invasion it was one of a series of 
dramatic policy reversals made in response to the popular revolt 
a top communist official also delivered an apology on live 
television wednesday night 
the communist party of czechoslovakia apologizes to the 
czechoslovak people for its past policies said evzen prusa a 
member of a working group responsible for guiding the congress 
it also apologizes for the events following 1968 and for 
expelling and harassing the innocent 
in late november the party ousted hardline leader milos jakes 
and others responsible for the crackdown after 1968 jakes also was 
among former leaders behind the 1970 expulsion of half a million 
people from the party including alexander dubcek the leader of the 
1968 reforms 
the party said his most recent failure was being responsible for 
the brutal police crackdown on peaceful demonstrations nov 17 that 
ignited the mass movement for an end to authoritarian rule 
in a speech that illustrated the partys current crisis urbanek 
told the congress that it had lost 66290 of its 17 million 
members in the past month 
about 1000 new members have joined including 143 people purged 
from the party after the 1968 invasion who were recently 
rehabilitated he said

increasing its troop strength in the former panama canal zone in 
march 1988

what we are saying to north america is that when you invade

sears roebuck and co says it is 
immediately pulling off the market a toy that simulates a rocket 
booster blowing up 
four boise children had complained the toy represented sick 
humor after the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle challenger 
sears spokesman gordon jones said wednesday in an interview from 
chicago that the building blaster toy is removed from sale we 
will not fill orders 
jones said the toy was pulled out of concern that we may have 
offended some customers he said the company had as many as 100 
complaints 
the sons of christa and gary sanders jared 13 seth 9 
spencer 5 and cody 3 spotted the toy in the sears holiday 
wishbook catalog and wrote sears and president bush to complain 
we dont want children learning to blow up space shuttles 
they wrote 
the national aeronautics and space administration got the 
sanders letter to bush and submitted a complaint of its own to 
sears 
jared praised the withdrawal of the product but said thats 
something they should have thought of earlier 
the toy available only through the toy catalog was advertised 
in the wishbook as simulating a countdown gone awry construct 
the rocket pad and prepare missile for launch ticking timer 
detonation device destroys the entire structure 
john bohach a vice president of the manufacturer kenner 
products inc said from cincinnati that the company had no 
intention of equating the toy with the challenger he said the 
company found that kids like to build things and like to knock 
them down 
jones said two other toys in the building blaster series a 
communications tower and a bridge also are withdrawn

a former police official suspected in the 
disappearance of money from a secret 14 million police department 
fund was arrested on fraud charges today 
kenneth weiner a former civilian deputy chief who resigned in 
1986 amid allegations of a pyramid scheme was arrested as he 
stepped off a flight from los angeles about 1215 am the fbi 
said he awaited a bail hearing today 
the fbi charged weiner with wire fraud in a 1986 precious metals 
investment scheme in which detroit investors lost thousands of 
dollars officials refused to say how they learned of his travel 
plans 
weiner had dropped from sight in recent weeks as the fbi and 
city officials looked into the 14 million fund used for 
undercover narcotics operations weiner had access to the fund from 
1980 to 1986 while deputy chief 
police chief william hart has accused weiner of diverting 
hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fund and funneling money 
into phony corporations in california records also show a phony 
california corporation connected to weiner paid 72000 rent on a 
beverly hills home occupied by harts daughter and her husband 
weiner has not been charged in the disappearance of the money 
hart has said he was unaware of problems with the fund 
including the rent payments for his daughter until recently 
mayor coleman young reluctantly turned records of the fund over 
to city auditors this week but some documents needed to trace 
money were missing 
young initially maintained that turning over the records could 
jeopardize undercover operations 
last week the fbi raided weiners apartment in ann arbor and 
seized boxes of documents

defense secretary dick cheney raised the 
prospect today that some american forces could be withdrawn from 
panama by christmas even though gen manuel antonio noriega a 1 
million bounty on his head evaded a huge military manhunt 
the pentagon issued a new report on casualties from the massive 
invasion intended to usher in a new democratic government in 
panama and wipe out noriega 18 us servicemen killed 117 wounded 
and one missing there was also one american civilian death that 
of a woman teacher 
at least a dozen americans were held hostage by noriegas forces 
and the smithsonian institution said 11 scientists and technicians 
were missing from a research institute and believed taken hostage 
given the size of the operation and its complexity and the 
opposition thats been encountered the level of casualties is 
probably lower than would have been expected the defense 
secretary said on cnn 
i think within the next few weeks well be able to return the 
situation back to where were relying only on those us forces 
that were in the country prior to the intervention he added 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said 
most of the military objectives had been accomplished we are 
seeing a mopping uptype activity he said 
powell said reports of noriegas whereabouts had been received 
throughout the night and were chased down but without results 
we do not know where he is powell said on abctvs good 
morning america 
while president bush drew broad support from congress there 
were hints that the political backing might erode if the military 
deployment turns out to be a prolonged one 
both the president and the congress i think assume that this 
is going to be an operation that will be concluded as soon as 
possible said house speaker tom foley dwash on cbstvs 
this morning 
deep skepticism about the operation came from rep charles b 
rangel dny weve been waiting for some darn excuse to invade 
panama 
but sen richard lugar rind said things had reached the 
edge the president had to act 
in all bush ordered 9500 soldiers and marines into panama to 
bolster the 13000 already based there 
cheney said the americans were beginning to get telephone calls 
in response to the 1 million reward for the capture of noriega 
that was posted wednesday night at the end of the first day of the 
american intervention 
so hopefully well be able to wrap up mr noriega in the near 
future and return him to the united states for trial cheney said 
he expressed the belief that noriega had not left panama 
noriega and 16 associates were indicted in miami and tampa 
fla last year on drugtrafficking charges 
powell said he was not worried about noriega still being at 
liberty since he wielded no power any longer he no longer 
controls the drug money and he no longer is in a position to give 
out his favors or his punishments the general said 
reports from panama said american forces had met stiff 
resistance during the night with heavy fighting raging just before 
dawn in the middleclass suburb of san miguelito but by daybreak 
the fighting had ceased us army troops patrolled the streets of 
panama city but were unable to prevent widespread looting 
in an interview on cbs this morning cheney was pressed 
about when us units might be withdrawn 
i wouldnt want to make a hard and fast projection he 
replied 
i would guess that some of the units may be out by christmas 
but i think the key thing is for us to make certain that the 
situations under control that the new government of panama the 
democratic government is well established and a lot of that we 
can do with forces that are permanently in panama 
but we wont take anybody out until were confident that in 
fact the situations under control cheney added 
in panama noriega said on a governmentrun fm radio station 
that he will now lead a guerrilla war against the united states 
were in trench warfare now and we will maintain the 
resistance he said our slogan is to win or die not one step 
back 
powell said the chief us goal today would be to locate 
americans who were taken hostage by forces loyal to noriega in the 
chaotic opening hours of the operation

dozens of guests hiding in the seaside luxury marriott hotel in 
panama city cheered when a battalion of elite us airborne troops 
shot their way through a neighborhood to reach the building late 
wednesday night ending a day of terror 
cheney said the pentagon had received conflicting reports about 
american hostages 
its sort of a floating crap game he said there may well 
still be some americans held but at this point we havent been 
able to confirm specific identities or specific numbers 
bush is pleased by the military precision and smoothness of 
the operation said spokesman marlin fitzwater he said bush 
would take a planned vacation in texas next week 
cheney gave this situation report today 
the organized resistance by the panamanian forces has 
virutally ended what we still have though is a situation in 
which there are a fairly large number of socalled dignity 
battalion members that are loose in the streets many of them armed 
so its still a somewhat chaotic situation our forces are 
still involved in some cases in firefights and its not complete 
yet but weve made major progress 
in his speech bush extended official diplomatic recognition to 
a new panamanian government headed by guillermo endara the 
opposition candidate in last mays elections voided by noriega 
and moved swiftly to bolster him 
ambassador arthur davis returned to panama for the first time 
since the elections at a heavily guarded news conference on a 
military base attended only by a poo of washingtonbased reporters 
davis said he was bringing an economic recovery plan for discussion 
with panamas new leaders 
he made no promise of us aid except to point out that 700 
million in assets would be returned as a result of bushs decision 
to lift economic sanctions 
davis added that deep down he thought leaders of other 
regional countries would be happy to have noriega gone despite 
their stated opposition to us military intervention 
the united states defended its decision at the united nations 
and at the organization of american states meeting in washington 
vice president dan quayle spoke by telephone with endaras vice 
presidents billy ford and ricardo arias calderon and 
administration officials also said privately he might visit panama 
next month in a gesture that would dramatize administration support 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said the bounty on 
noriegas head would come from an existing drug enforcement fund 
the reward is coupled with an offer of 150 per weapon to 
noriega loyalists who surrender their firearms 
the assault was the first time us military force had been used 
against a foreign government since the 1986 air raid on libya and 
the first fullfledged assault since the invasion of grenada in 
1983 
it came after american forces sat by inactive on oct 3 when 
dissident panamanian officers attempted a coup and briefly held 
noriega an incident that subjected bush to congressional 
criticism for timidity and indecision

us military officials say they 
have concluded that most of the fighting between pronoriega forces 
and american troops has subsided and that little real threat 
remains 
col ronald sconyers director of public affairs for the us 
southern command said wednesday evening that a lot of the sporadic 
gunfire still being heard around the country is from roving bands 
of noriega loyalists known as dignity battlations who are just 
getting their last licks in 
early wednesday morning john bushnell the us charge 
daffaires in panama briefed the pool after president bush spoke 
to the nation he said it was the clear desire of the new 
government to take contol 
bushnell said he had dinner monday night with three officials 
that us authorities say were elected in may 7 balloting 
president guillermo endara and vice presidents ricardo arias 
calderon and guillermo ford noriega annulled the elections 
after getting pledges of secrecy from the civilian leaders 
bushnell said he outlined the scope of the us military plans he 
said they wrote bush a letter affirming their support for the us 
assistance 
asked why the panamanian civilian leaders had changed their 
minds about having us rather than panamanian forces oust noriega 
bushnell said there had been no snap conversion 
i dont think it was overnight he said it was a matter 
that the panamanians werent being very successful in doing it 
after the failed coup on oct 3 he said there was a feeling 
that well there werent many more panamanians left with guns that 
might do it so it was becoming a hopeless situation 
they never said it so many words we wish you would really 
send the 82nd airborne to do it but they clearly indicated their 
frustration that if we didnt the situation was just going to go 
on and get worse bushnell said 
the new leaders main concern he said was that if noriega were 
shot another panamanian defense force colonel might take his place 
bushnell said he thinks it is certainly possible that 
noriega might run for the hills to hide out or possibly seek refuge 
in cuba or nicaragua but he said it was unlikely he would take to 
the hills to form a guerrilla movement inside panama because he 
lacks sufficient popular support 
bushnell said calls were made to panamanan defense force 
representatives by both the new government leaders and military 
officers in some instances he said the military officers would 
speak to whomever answered the telephone at pdf headquarters and 
say in effect this is suicide pack it in 
at least two mortar rounds hit the embassy wednesday us 
officials said bushnell said that although noriega remained at 
large officials had expectations at the outset of the operation 
that he could be seized 
if he had been at one of the several places we took down we 
would have gotten him but he wasnt bushness said

the united states has plenty of plutonium for 
future use in nuclear weapons and the bush administration should 
drop plans to spend 1 billion to expand supplies of the material 
a government advisory panel concludes 
the conclusion published wednesday by a special committee of the 
national research council contradicts the administrations repeated 
assertions to congress that additional capacity to make 
weapongrade plutonium is vital to national security 
the energy department which owns the nations defense nuclear 
materials plants issued a brief statement saying it had not fully 
analyzed the document but would respond in detail within 30 days 
it said the reports recommendations appear to to fully 
consistent with and supportive of actions already taken or 
planned by the department 
former energy secretary john herrington said during the reagan 
administration that the nation is awash in plutonium but his 
successor james d watkins had disavowed the statement watkins 
contends that while current plutonium supplies are adequate more 
capacity will be needed in the coming decade 
the research council said it saw no good reason either to 
produce more virgin plutonium or to increase the capacity for 
processing recycled plutonium from old weapons it also challenged 
watkins plan to build a 600 million plant in idaho that would 
convert reactorgrade plutonium to weapongrade material 
the department of energy should concentrate on making better 
use of existing plutonium processing capacity as required and 
postpone plans to construct additional capabilities the report 
said 
many private arms control groups have long advocated scaling 
back plutonium operations 
this is a certification by a semiofficial body that you dont 
need additional plutonium supplies said david albright senior 
staff scientist of the federation of american scientists 
the report also criticized some aspects of the energy 
departments overall management of the weapons complex which 
includes 17 major plants and laboratories in 12 states 
on the subject of plutonium the report noted that the united 
states already has more than 20000 nuclear weapons 
the plutonium in these devices plus that in the supply chain 
is obviously sufficient to supply a nuclear deterrent of the 
existing size or even greater it said 
official information on nuclear arms materials is classified 
watkins has advocated building a special isotope separation 
plant at the idaho national engineering laboratory near idaho 
falls it would use a new vaporizing technology to convert 
reactorgrade plutonium now stored near richland wash into 
plutonium suitable for use in nuclear weapons 
the scientific panel cited several reasons for scrapping the 
idaho project 
to our knowledge no compelling need for this material has 
been demonstrated its report said 
it also said the idaho facility if built could complicate 
international efforts to limit the spread of nuclear arms the new 
isotope separation technology could be obtained by other countries 
to convert fuel used in civilian nuclear reactors into highgrade 
plutonium needed to build nuclear bombs it said 
john spratt dsc chairman of a special house committee on 
defense nuclear facilities said in a telephone interview that the 
reports conclusion about plutonium supplies combined with 
congressional resistance to adding more capacity make it very 
unlikely that the special isotope separation plant will be built 
the report also said the energy department should drop plans to 
spend 400 million renovating a building at the rocky flats plant 
near denver that recycles scrap plutonium into weaponsgrade 
material 
the research council is an arm of the national academy of 
sciences a congressionally chartered group that conducts special 
research at the request of the government

a swedish court today convicted mohammed 
abu talb a palestinian suspected in the bombing of flight 103 of 
terrorism charges in connection with a fatal 1985 attack on an 
airline office 
the 35yearold palestinian was sentenced to life in prison for 
the july 1985 bombing of a northwest airline office in copenhagen 
the attack killed one person and wounded more than 20 
a codefendent marten imandi also 35 was convicted of charges 
in connection with the copenhagen attack and was sentenced to life 
in prison 
in sweden life imprisonment usually means 20 years at most 
the court found imandi guilty of murder for placing the fatal 
explosive and convicted abu talb as an acessory 
the convictions were part of a series legal actions concluded 
today against a terrorist ring involved in bombings of us 
israeli and jewish targets in copenhagen and amsterdam in 1985 
they were acquitted of another bombing in stockholm in 1986 
the court also sentenced mahmoud al mougrabi 24 to six years 
in prison and his 23yearold brother moustafa to a oneyear 
sentence for their involvement in the 1985 attacks 
by coincidence the verdict fell on the first anniversary of the 
bombing of flight 103 the pan am boeing 747 that went down in 
lockerbie scotland killing 270 people abu talb is a suspect in 
that bombing 
abu talbs possible connection with the disaster surfaced when 
it was established he had been in the mediterranean island of malta 
two months before the explosion when investigators believe the 
bomb may have been prepared 
shreds from clothes wrapped around the bomb could match clothing 
that abu talb brought back with him from malta scottish police 
seized 15 bags of clothing from his uppsala home nov 27 
legal expers have said that if he was indicted for the pan am 
explosion he could be extradited to face trial in a foreign 
country he likely would be returned to sweden to complete his 
sentence however 
abu talb who listed his birthplace as the sabra refugee camp in 
beirut lebanon is a former egyptian army soldier who deserted to 
join the palestine popular struggle front 
police have taken extra security precautions at airports around 
sweden this week in anticipation of a possible terror attack to 
mark the flight 103 anniversary experts warned that a guilty 
verdict could heighten the risk 
the 100page decision by the court in uppsala 40 miles north of 
stockholm was distributed at the courthouse without a hearing 
meanwhile a swedish newspaper reported today that further 
evidence had been uncovered linking abu talb to the pan am 
explosion over lockerbie 
the dagens nyheter newspaper said police found a 1988 calendar 
with the date dec 21 circled the day the plane was blasted by a 
barometertriggered explosive concealed in a radiotape player 
inside a suitcase 
scottish police tried to question abu talb on tuesday but he 
refused to cooperate the officers reportedly left sweden and were 
due back after the holidays to continue their probe 
lord fraser scotlands chief law officer has said no 
prosecutions were imminent in the case and no extraditions had been 
requested he was quoted in london last week as saying the united 
states likely would claim jurisdiction and any trial would be held 
there

president francois mitterrand of france said 
today that the days of romanian leader nicolae ceausescu are 
numbered and called for his replacement 
it is a regime of personal family power that has no honest 
reason to remain mitterrand said at a news conference during his 
threeday visit to east germany i think that the days of this 
regime in a europe in full movement are numbered but at what 
price 
in his first condemnation of the bloody suppression of protests 
in romania mitterrand ruled out foreign intervention to topple 
ceausescu he said the response has to come from romania 
mitterrand also met with east german political leaders today to 
express the concerns of the west about the possibility of german 
unification 
his visit came as west german chancellor helmut kohl told west 
german lawmakers that the germanys plan to strengthen all economic 
and political ties 
but kohl also tried to ease the concerns of european nations 
worried about a united germany saying the growing closeness of the 
two countries can only help the continent 
meanwhile the west german government said east germany would 
open berlins brandenburg gate on friday the gate is a historic 
portion of the berlin wall viewed by many as a symbol of german 
unity 
kohl east german premier hans modrow west berlin walter 
momper and east berlin mayor erhard krack will participate in the 
historic ceremonies said government spokesman hans klein 
the official east german news agency adn said mitterrand met 
with modrow and that the joint responsibility for balance in 
europe was the main topic 
mitterrand and modrow also discussed the possibility of 
expanding ties while the east german premier expressed interest in 
a trade and cooperation agreement with the european economic 
community adn said 
it added that mitterrand had reacted positively to the idea 
of closer east german ties to the eec 
but before leaving paris on wednesday mitterrand said for 
the whole of europe it would not be good indeed it would be very 
dangerous to reopen the issue of the existing borders 
in an interview with east german television he also said the 
two paths open for the germans are the democratic path and the 
peaceful path 
the possibility of reunification was raised after the 
prodemocracy movement recently forced the communist party in east 
germany to oust its hardline leaders lift travel restrictions and 
open the berlin wall 
mitterrand arrived wednesday a few hours after kohl germany 
ended an emotionally charged visit to east germany that brought out 
thousands advocating reunification 
during mitterrands visit french and east german officials are 
to sign several agreements including a fiveyear project for 
closer economic and technical cooperation 
at a state dinner wednesday hosted by east germanys interim 
president manfred gerlach a noncommunist mitterrand paid tribute 
to the east german prodemocracy movement and said the germans 
should determine their own future 
but he stressed that no country may impose its political 
system on another he said closer german ties would result in the 
context of a strengthened european community and a general 
overcoming of the continents division mitterrand is representing 
the 12nation ec whose rotating presidency france holds until dec 
31 
he is also the first head of state from the three western world 
war ii allies to visit east berlin 
the united states soviet union france and britain have 
ultimate authority over berlin a result of the postwar occupation 
of hitlers defeated third reich 
while relations between kohl and mitterrand are close the 
french leaders statements before his trip highlighted traditional 
french wariness of a strong germany at the heart of europe

the state department citing changing 
conditions in the soviet union is giving high priority to 
constructing a new us embassy in moscow to replace the one to be 
razed after years of indecision 
the job could cost up to 500 million nicholas salgo a former 
us ambassador to hungary was assigned wednesday to hold formal 
negotiations with the kremlin in the meantime the soviets will 
continue to be shut out of their new embassy in the mt alto 
section of washington and relegated to an older mansion near the 
white house 
ever since us intelligence 10 years ago detected what was said 
to be a network of sophisticated listening devices in the moscow 
embassy us officials have pondered what to do with the 95 
million building 
finally on wednesday secretary of state james a baker iii 
notified key members of congress the embassy will be torn down and 
a new one constructed in its place 
baker who sent salgo and ivan selin the undersecretary of 
state for management to moscow on an inspection trip in april 
passed up the option of saving millions of dollars by demolishing 
only floors believed to be infested with bugs and salvaging 
others 
he also rejected the option of constructing an annex for 
topsecret business that would have involved at least two 
problems finding the space and creating an assumption that whoever 
entered the annex was involved in sensitive operations 
the decision was taken after a careful review of the 
alternatives for dealing with the bugged new building the state 
department said in a press release wednesday night 
the review showed that among the realistic alternatives the 
teardownrebuild option offered the optimum combination of 
security space cost and time required for rebuilding the 
statement added 
the embassy was built under a 1972 agreement made by the nixon 
administration that allowed the soviets to prefabricate offsite 
the concrete slabs for the building us officials did not insist 
on a right of inspection 
the agreement also provided for a new soviet embassy in the mt 
alto section of washington one of the highest points in the us 
capital it was built but the soviets were kept from occupying it 
while a decision on the moscow embassy was pending 
critics of the arrangement said americans gave away valuable 
real estate that also put the soviets in a good spot to monitor 
communications through listening devices the soviets however 
have not been able to occupy their new building until the problems 
with the moscow embassy are solved 
soviet occupancy of their new chancery building at mt alto 
remains linked to our occupancy of a new building in moscow the 
statement said 
it said there was progress in preliminary talks with soviet 
officials and added we look forward to working with the congress 
and getting on with the project 
the changing conditions in the soviet union have made 
resolution of this issue very high among our foreign policy 
priorities it said 
in april salgo and selin reported to baker that building an 
annex would be cheaper than the estimated 500 million cost of 
building a new embassy 
former president reagan last year advocated razing the building 
saying the united states had no choice but he left a decision 
to bush 
the state department said it will ask congress in the next 
budget for 270 million for initial building costs it also said 
the united states will press claims against the soviets to recover 
damages for implanting eavesdropping devices in the building and 
for shoddy workmanship 
meanwhile a trade group headed by dwayne o andreas chairman 
of archer daniels midland co offered to buy the building for use 
as business offices 
andreas is cochairman of the usussr trade and economic 
council which promotes trade between the two superpowers he made 
the offer on behalf of a consortium of us companies which would 
have used the building as a moscow headquarters 
bakers decision surfaced first on capitol hill where it was 
disclosed by the office of rep olympia snowe rmaine 
i am extremely pleased that the bush administration has given 
final approval to the total reconstruction of our bugged embassy 
building in moscow snowes office said our goal now must be 
to move quickly to build a secure facility

family member who fatally stabbed pregnant actress sharon tate 
20 years ago has been denied parole for the ninth time 
fellow manson disciple leslie van houten was scheduled for a 
parole hearing this morning 
the victims mother argued wednesday against ms atkins release 
i dont understand why anyone would murder an innocent 
pregnant woman doris tate told the threemember parole board 
the thing that goes continually through my mind is the lack of 
compassion susan had for sharon 
in rejecting her bid for release the state parole board noted 
ms atkins had a role in eight murders for the bizarre motive of 
starting a race war 
ms atkins 41 is serving a life sentence for murders that 
included the 1969 slayings of miss tate and of grocer leno labianca 
and his wife the following night ms atkins wont get another 
parole hearing until 1992

east germany recalled its ambassador and 
czechoslovakia issued a formal protest as european nations formed a 
united front today to condemn the bloody repression of protesters 
in romania 
the international outcry came after reports that security forces 
for the second time in a week fired on crowds of protesters in 
romania and that shooting also occurred in the western romanian 
city of arad 
east germany where the hardline government was toppled by 
reformers in october condemned what it called the brutal action 
of the romanian state power against peaceful citizens demonstrating 
to assert their elementary human rights 
in a statement the government called on romania to halt 
immediately all violence against its people east german ambassador 
herbert plaschke was recalled from romania for consultations in 
east berlin 
czechoslovakia also summoned a senior romanian diplomat to 
receive a protest from the foreign ministry in prague 
massive protests in czechoslovakia and east germany in recent 
months have toppled the old hardline regimes in those nations and 
ushered in new eras of breathtaking reforms 
but the regime of romanian president nicolae ceausescu has tried 
to crush the protests with bloodshed according to reports reaching 
the west last weekend security forces fired on protesters in the 
western city of timisoara 
government protests against the ceausescu regime continued in 
hungary which has long had tense relations with bucharest because 
of alleged harassment of the 17 million ethnic hungarians in 
romania 
there exists or has developed in romania a serious political 
movement said hungarian foreign minister gyula horn i do not 
know exactly wheter it is comprehensive it is an anticeausescu 
movement 
there is no accurate information on its strength on the 
extent to which it has spread he said 
the soviet union officially reacted with caution but the 
staterun tass news agency stepped up coverage of the romanian 
events giving vivid accounts of violence against demonstrators by 
the government 
if we do receive information on victims among people we of 
course will be extremely sorry for them said soviet foreign 
ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev 
we should emphasize that we do have opinions on what is 
happening but in my place as an official representative of the 
ministry of foreign affairs i cannot go into comments without 
having allinclusive information and orders in that regard 
in east berlin french president francois mitterrand was far 
more blunt 
it is a regime of personal family power that has no honest 
reason to remain he told reporters i think that the days of 
this regime in a europe in full movement are numbered but at 
what price 
ruling out foreign intervention mitterrand said the response 
has to come from romania 
in bonn chancellor helmut kohls chief spokesman hans klein 
said kohl was deeply shocked over the brutal repression of the 
justified and peaceful protests of the romanian people 
he strongly condemns the massive use of weapons and the 
reprehensible attempts by the romanian leadership to suppress the 
efforts for freedom and democracy klein said quoting kohl 
klein said kohl appeals to those responsible at all levels in 
romania to halt repression by the military and security police and 
to open a dialogue on the justified demands of people 
in london the foreign office said common market countries were 
considering a withdrawal of ambassadors from romania in the wake of 
the weekend massacre of civilians during antigovernment 
demonstrations 
but the spokesman stressed that this was only one of a number of 
options under consideration by the 12 member states as a response 
to the crackdown 
meanwhile italy announced it has recalled its ambassador to 
romania luigi amaduzzi for consultations 
the greek government also condemned the suppression of the 
romanian protests and all political parties also expressed outrage 
the athens academy of sciences stripped ceausescus wife elena 
of her membership awarded in 1976 
in austria president kurt waldheim expressed his deep 
concern over bloody repression of the peace movement in 
romania 
he spoke of a serious violation of human rights 
the communist regime in romania is very brutal and the 
western countries whose unity in this matter could be greater 
should use all possibilities in order to help set afoot reforms in 
romania austrian foreign minister alois mock said 
dutch foreign minister hans van den broek wednesday on summoned 
romanian ambassador constantin statescu and told him of the hague 
governments grave concern about the repression of defenseless 
demonstrators 
van den broek also appealed to the ceausescu government not to 
turn a dead ear to the populations call for change and 
threatened further measures in line with the other 11 nations 
of the european community

prime minister vp singhs minority 
government passed its first test of support thursday winning a 
vote of confidence in parliament as expected 
a chorus of yes arose when the vote was called and speaker 
rabi ray of singhs peoples party declared the motion carried the 
congress party of former prime minister rajiv gandhi abstained 
singh who led a broad coalition in the november elections 
presented the confidence motion he had pledges of support from 
several parties that would have given him more half the votes if a 
roll call vote had been necessary 
he took office dec 2 ending gandhis fiveyear tenure as prime 
minister and named his cabinet three days later under a deadline 
set by president ramaswamy venkataraman he had until jan 1 to 
obtain approval from the legislators 
shortly before the vote was taken singh told parliament his 
government showed india could turn from personalities to issues in 
choosing a leader 
the delicate balance of political forces may turn out to be 
the most glorious occasion for our democracy said the new prime 
minister whose victory ended a hold on power by the congress party 
that extended back through gandhis mother indira to his 
grandfather jawaharlal nehru 
it is only the second time since independence from britain in 
1947 that the congress party has not controlled the government 
this also was the first time a prime minister or his party had 
initiated a confidence motion 
the constitution does not require a confidence vote for a new 
government but neither does it prohibit one president 
venkataraman felt a vote was the best way to determine whether 
singhs government could function 
in the elections gandhis congress party won 193 of the 525 
seats in the lower house of parliament making it the largest 
single party the peoples party won 137 seats and its partners in 
the national front alliance won three

kelly director of operations for the joint chiefs of staff 
outlined three goals for the days military operation continued 
support for the operations of the new government to secure panama 
city and to continue to track mr noriega in an effort to capture 
him 
he said us forces had secured the legislative building and he 
raised the possibility that guillermo endara the new usbacked 
president would go there during the day 
the formal briefing came several hours after defense secretary 
dick cheney called the deaths of american servicemen a terrible 
tragedy but said the number of casualties was low given the 
complexity of the operation 
as for noriega who now as a 1 million us bounty on his head 
cheney said were getting phone calls coming in from panamanians 
who have suspicions thoughts or ideas about where noriega may be 
hiding 
we will chase down the individual reports but we do not know 
where he is said gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff 
in television interviews powell and cheney said it was unclear 
how many americans were being detained or held hostage in panama 
you can be sure however that this is a primary concern for 
us today powell said on abctvs good morning america we 
will do everything we can to determine who is unaccounted for and 
do everything we can to locate those individuals 
reinforcements were sent in late wednesday from fort ord 
calif and fort bragg nc to bolster the us troops 
participating in operation just cause to about 24000 men 
cheney said he hoped some of the troops would be called home by 
christmas but powell and other pentagon officials said it was 
unclear when the united states would be withdraw all of the troops 
sent in to bolster those already stationed at the panama canal 
the us attack force planned to make sure panama citys streets 
were clear of noriega loyalists today kelly said adding that most 
panamanian units had dispersed and may have fled into the jungle 
there is every chance that we will go off after them he 
added 
kelly and sheafer also on the staff of the joint chiefs said 
wednesday there were difficult tasks ahead even though the 
panamanian defense forces were largely subdued 
we went after them first we have reduced them kelly said 
thats a problem were having in a lot of areas in that much of 
the pdf is fleeing in the face of the us military units 
the americans next priority was to ferret out 18 socalled 
dignity battalions armed gangs primarily roaming the streets of 
panama city a metropolis of about 1 million people officials said 
the battalions vary in size from as few as a couple of dozen 
people to about 250 said sheafer they are throughout many 
parts of panama city at this time 
the move into the city is designed in part to protect americans 
and others kelly said 
urban operations are possibly the most difficult kind he 
said to sweep through its going to take a lot of people 
kelly said the americans some of whom had been up for three 
days traveling and fighting were exhausted 
about 7000 troops including army rangers marines 
paratroopers from the 82nd airborne division special units and 
military police were flown into panama tuesday evening for the 1 
am predawn startup on wednesday 
they joined about 13000 us troops stationed in panama with 
the primary mission of protecting the panama canal the canal was 
open wednesday with no threat from the panamanians kelly said 
us troops relied on heavy equipment in their efforts to rout 
the pdf four light tanks called sheridans were brought to panama 
earlier kelly said the military also used six apache helicopters 
and some air force ac130 gunships

sir hector monro said before the group joined in singing the 
lord is my shepherd at the end of the 10minute ceremony 
names of the victims are carved in roughly alphabetical order 
family members are grouped together in the light polished granite 
of the 6foot memorial consisting of three panels 
as darkness fell an american couple paul and eleanor hudson 
whose 16yearold daughter melina was killed lit 270 luminarias 
candles in sandfilled bags along a path leading to the 
memorial and in a circle before it 
its the greatest honor i can think of said mrs hudson

a 52pound turkey once bound for a 
christmas banquet table is pecking away in a back yard because an 
animal control officer didnt have the heart to wring its neck 
the turkey was found waddling the streets this week and senior 
animal control officer john gonzales initially hoped to donate it 
to a group that feeds the homeless 
everyone was interested in getting a turkey that large but no 
one wanted him alive he said but no one wanted to kill the 
bird especially not gonzales 
so he turned to beach charities a nonprofit group that 
sponsors a christmas adoptapet program 
sharrie dyer director of beach charities said she liked the 
idea of donating a big turkey to feed the homeless but she hated 
the idea of playing benefactor and butcher 
after all she said our mascot is a 7foot pelican long 
beak how would it look for long beak to kill a turkey 
so she bought 20 lifeless turkeys for the christmas dinners of 
needy families 
and animal control officers donna and paul clement adopted the 
gobbler and added him to their menagerie on their ranch near corona 
his name 
lotto of course said gonzales because hes so lucky to

as the security council convened for an 
emergency debate on the us invasion of panama the question that 
immediately arose was who speaks for panama 
the council was expected to recognize a new panamanian 
ambassador today said diplomats and un officials speaking 
privately 
at issue was which government was legitimate that of strongman 
gen manuel antonio noriega or guillermo endaras which was 
installed by the us troops that invaded panama early wednesday 
and smashed noriegas forces 
the united states with help from other western members pressed 
wednesday for recognition of a new ambassador appointed by endaras 
government 
diplomats said endara had appointed eduardo vallarino a 
panamanian businessman in selfimposed exile in the united states 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said today the 
council was faced with an unprecedented situation because the 
upheaval occurred when panama had no accredited un ambassador to 
argue a case 
the previous permanent representative leonardo kam was 
promoted to foreign minister and no one took his place 
noriegas government is trying to have its ambassador to the 
european community mirla bellavita accredited as un ambassador 
perez de cuellar said of the us invasion that the position 
of the united nations for the last 45 years is that we always 
regret the use of force 
at the same time i think i shouldnt forget to say that what 
is important as well for the united nations is the preservation of 
democracy he added 
endara won the presidency in panamas national elections may 
79 but the noriegacontrolled government nullified the results 
before they were announced 
during wednesdays debate us ambassador thomas r pickering 
said his country had exercised its right to selfdefense under 
international law and the un charter in response to armed 
attacks by forces under the direction of manuel noriega 
panamanian soldiers shot and killed a us marine officer at a 
roadblock saturday night one day after noriega declared a state 
of war existed between his country and the united states 
american officials said the marine a lieutenant was unarmed 
and that the attack on him and three fellow americans was 
unprovoked 
pickering said the incident capped two years of harassment of 
us military personnel and workers at the panama canal commission 
he said more than 400 us personnel had been detained and 140 
endangered 
pickering noted that noriegas 1988 indictment in the united 
states on drugtrafficking and moneylaundering charges 
gen noriega could not be permitted falsely to wrap himself in 
the flag of panamanian sovereignty while the colombian drug 
cartels with which he is allied intervene throughout this 
hemisphere the ambassador said 
that is aggression it is aggression against us all and now 
it is being brought to an end pickering said 
his ruthless cabal repeatedly obstructed the will of the 
panamanian people which has been expressed in the may free 
elections which noriegas candidate lost pickering said 
the ambassadors of nicaragua china and the soviet union 
criticized the invasion and said us troops should be withdrawn 
immediately 
britain and canadas ambassadors defended the intervention 
saying noriega had provoked it 
ambassador pierrelouis blanc of france agreed that the united 
states had been provoked but said for us use of outside force 
is deplorable whatever the circumstances 
panama has repeatedly come before the council to complain about 
allegedly provocative us military maneuvers it said were intended 
to lay the groundwork for an invasion to topple noriega 
during council debates in april and august panama claimed the 
united states was trying to provoke confrontations in order to keep 
control of the panama canal 
under 1977 treaties the united states will cede control of the 
canal to panama at the end of 1999

president bushs nighttime airlift of 
thousands of soldiers to a battle zone in panama was a 
hereandnow guns and planes example of what some pentagon 
planners see as the army of the future 
with the pentagon facing likely budget restraints in the coming 
years and with a declining soviet threat suggesting deep troop 
reductions in europe senior army planners have proposed that 
their service be molded into a lighter more flexible fighting 
force that can be ordered to hot spots within hours 
since the panamanian strike came as defense secretary dick 
cheney was hammering out the pentagons fiveyear budget 
projections some senior army officials indicated that the timing 
couldnt hurt their cause 
we made a decision and in almost no time at all we were 
putting our paratroopers and our rangers on airplanes and sending 
them down there army gen tom w kelly the director of 
operations for the pentagons joint staff told reporters on 
wednesday 
i dont know that theres another country in the world that 
can do that kelly said 
there were some advantages in the panama situation that wouldnt 
necessarily be present in many foreign battle scenes the army was 
able to do months of onthescene planning in panama and link up 
with an established fighting force of some 13000 soldiers sailors 
and helicopter gunship pilots already based there 
as well commanders could count on cooperation from the air 
force navy and marines the army would like to plan on that in the 
future but the past has shown that service rivalries can make for 
messy military operations 
some of the ideas for revamping the army were first put forward 
this year by the army chief of staff gen carl vuono that was in 
a white paper that envisioned a pareddown force that would 
rely more on air assault light infantry and mechanized units the 
very mix that was used in the panamanian operation 
the army of the future is one that is versatile an army 
that can be forward deployed albeit at smaller numbers an army 
that has a contingency package that can go worldwide an army that 
has a mix of heavy light and special operations forces vuono 
told reporters in october 
army plans envision slashing the current 764000strong force to 
630000 by 1994 army sources have said 
gen gordon r sullivan the armys deputy chief of staff for 
operations and plans predicted in an interview last week that by 
199596 youll see more of the nations forces in the 
continental us but that those soldiers will be capable of 
responding to any contingency 
sullivan added that while the army is preparing for the future 
its leaders are determined not to repeat what they consider the 
mistakes of the past such as the postworld war ii drawdowns 
that caught the military off guard at the break out of the korean 
war 
while americas new military will be a smaller fighting force 
he said it should be trained to take on new roles and be prepared 
to fight in third world arenas battle the nations drug scourge or 
help deal with such disasters as hurricane hugo and the san 
franciscoarea earthquake 
the army must maintain its relevance to respond to various 
requirements sullivan said 
the planning officer said he is confident that the army has 
the structure to be able to respond to change even though the 
challenges of the future may be difficult to see at this time 
we know where were going and we know what we should look like 
when we get there he said 
army officers familiar with vuonos plans walked the pentagons 
halls with smiles on their faces after the panama intervention 
touting the strike as an example of their future fighting force 
even if it is a smaller one 
versatile deployable lethal chanted one army colonel 
using the three catchwords that define the forces new proposals 
eighteen hours from stand to start its the army of the 
future said an army general of the time required for the 
panamanian deployment 
another colonel pointed to the complex effort involved in 
ferrying troops from both east and west us coasts and dropping 
some 3000 paratroopers from 1200 feet in the air so that they 
could team up with mechanized units and helicopters that had been 
moved into panama in advance 
there wasnt one life lost in that nighttime parachute drop 
in world war ii they expected to lose between 10 to 15 percent of 
their men one officer said

antigovernment protesters in the romanian capital of bucharest 
today and several demonstrators were killed yugoslav radio

around several thousand mostly young people at a main intersection 
in an effort to control the burgeoning unrest said a yugoslav 
reporter 
a soviet news report from bucharest said along the central 
street of the capital tanks are moving following the lines of 
submachine gunners pushing back the crowds bursts of automatic 
weapons fire are being heard panicstricken people are hiding in 
doorways and courtyards 
the unrest was the first reported in the capital since 
demonstrations against the hardline president nicolae ceausescu 
broke out over the weekend on the other side of the country in the 
city of timisoara 
there were chilling reports by yugoslav media that soldiers and 
police who refused to shoot at demonstrators in timisoara were 
publicly executed and tass said workers occupied businesses in the 
western city today and threatened to blow them up if demands for a 
new government were not met 
hungarian radio said the romanian communist partys ruling 
politburo was meeting in an unannounced session which was likely 
to discuss measures to curb the unrest it said some protesters 
chanted the army is with us 
the unrest is the biggest challenge to ceausescus 24yearlong 
authoritarian rule and reportedly has spread to a dozen cities 
access to the country by foreign reporters is strictly curtailed 
but witnesses have said hundreds and perhaps thousands of people 
have been killed 
shots were also reported fired today at protesters in the city 
of arad about 40 miles from timisoara there was no immediate word 
on casualties there security forces first used tear gas to try to 
quell protests in bucharest a reporter for the yugoslav news

gathered in the square are shouting the slogans freedom down 
with dictatorship they are stopping buses and cars 
security forces also fired on protesters during a general strike 
in arad according to klaus lanz a spokesman for ethnic german 
romanians based in munich 
a romanian who arrived in yugoslavia today from timisoara said 
that city was in the second day of a general strike asking that he 
not be identified he told reporters at the border he had heard 
reports of demonstrations today in the southern city of craiova and 
in suceava in the north 
tass said factories in timisoara were closed and occupied by 
workers who demanded that the government resign the military leave 
the city and leaders be called to account for the loss of lives in 
the city 
according to the latest information the military units have 
started to leave tass said 
in east germany today the government recalled its ambassador 
from bucharest and czechoslovakia issued a formal protest as 
european nations formed a united front to condemn the repression 
president francois mitterrand of france said ceausescus days 
are numbered and called for his replacement but he ruled out 
foreign intervention to topple ceausescu who has refused to adopt 
the reforms accepted in other east bloc countries 
elsewhere in the east bloc today 
the czechoslovak communist party voted to immediately disband 
the hated paramilitary peoples militia which was used to help 
crush dissent a day after publicly apologizing for its hardline 
policies of the past 
hungarys parliament paved the way for free elections next year 
by voting to dissolve itself in march 
the western diplomat in bucharest who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said by telephone that ceausescu was interrupted today 
at an official rally called to support his tough stance against 
protesters 
the speech was broadcast on radio and television when shouts 
erupted the broadcast abruptly switched to patriotic music for 
about three minutes it then then resumed with ceausescu in 
midsentence 
as ceausescu returned to the air waves people were heard loudly 
applauding his promises of a higher minimum wage increased 
allowances for families with children and other benefits 
apparently intended to quell discontent the diplomat said 
but protesters then marched through the streets of bucharest 
shouting anticeausescu slogans the source said hungarian radio 
said people burned banners they were issued for the proceausescu 
rally 
witnesses say hundreds possibly thousands of unarmed people 
were shot to death in timisoara on saturday and sunday while 
protesting ceausescu

security agents after refusing to fire on antigovernment 
demonstrators

students arriving in yugoslavia this morning from timisoara said 
demonstrations were still going on in the city during the night 
a resident of timisoara told hungarian television that 80000 to 
90000 people took part 
breaking his silence on the unrest wednesday ceausescu blamed 
the protests on hooligans incited by a brazen campaign of 
slander and lies from abroad especially hungary 
he has been accused by budapest of persecuting ethnic 
hungarians who are concentrated in the transylvanian region that 
includes timisoara

jailed black leader nelson mandela 
held an emotional reunion thursday with an ailing 84yearold 
white women who was his codefendant in a landmark antiapartheid 
trial 28 years ago 
helen joseph who in the 1960s was one of the first whites 
banned by the government spent four hours with mandela in victor 
verster prison near cape town 
he was in very good form full of jokes full of laughter 
ms joseph said outside the prison gate he looks forward to 
coming home but he doesnt know when it will be 
she described the meeting as a wonderful friendly loving 
visit 
mandela 71 heads the outlawed african national congress 
guerrilla movement and is the countrys best known black leader he 
has been imprisoned for more than 27 years and is serving a life 
sentence for plotting to overthrow the whiterun government but 
his release is widely expected within weeks 
mandela and ms joseph both emerged as leading voices of the 
antiapartheid movement in the 1950s they were among more than 150 
codefendants at a marathon treason trial from 195661 
ms joseph now confined to a wheelchair most of the time 
recalled how she and mandela often traveled together to the 
courthouse in pretoria to take their minds off the trial they 
would take turns picking out homes where they would want to live 
she said 
all the accused were acquitted but the trial made clear the 
governments intention to clamp down on opponents mandela went 
underground shortly after the trial to form the ancs armed wing 
he was arrested in 1962 and has been imprisoned since 
ms joseph resumed her antiapartheid activities after the 
trial but was placed under police restrictions including house 
arrest for most of the 1960s and 1970s police lifted the 
restrictions in 1982 when she was 77 a year later she was 
arrested for singing and giving a clenchedfist black power salute 
while attending a treason trial 
last year the anc awarded her its highest award for her 
outstanding contribution to the struggle to end apartheid and 
transform south africa into a united democratic and nonracial 
country 
she still goes to antiapartheid rallies in her wheelchair and 
is greeted with rousing cheers by black audiences 
she said both she and mandela were excited to see one another 
for the first time in 28 years all her previous requests to visit 
mandela had been turned down 
she said mandela has agreed to meet government leaders 
including president fw de klerk because the time has come for 
peaceful talks between the government and the anc 
the anc cant give up the armed struggle at this stage but he 
mandela is very hopeful said ms joseph 
she said mandela believes de klerk is a sincere person but 
his limitation will be what his national party government will 
allow him to do he feels de klerk is not a free man 
de klerk says he wants to end discrimination and bring blacks 
into the national government within five years however he opposes 
a oneman onevote system and envisions a mechanism that will give 
whites veto power on major policy decisions

the former conservative party chairman on thursday 
denounced as folly the governments plan to give residence 
rights to 225000 hong kong people 
norman tebbit said he would join other tory rebels to vote with 
the opposition labor party against the policy which he said has 
split prime minister margaret thatchers conservative party from 
top to bottom 
conservatives have expressed concern the plan will encourage a 
wave of immigration in britain the labor party called it 
divisive and elitist 
tebbit spoke in favor of the past conservative policy allowing 
no further largescale immigration and said british people fear 
they will be swamped by people of different culture history and 
religion the fact is that most people in britain did not want 
to live in a multicultural multiracial society but it has been 
foisted on them 
the plan announced wednesday by foreign secretary douglas hurd 
aims to prevent a crippling brain drain from hong kong before it 
reverts to rule by china when britains lease on the colony expires 
in 1997 
hurd told the house of commons that a maximum of 50000 key 
people in hong kong plus their families would be given full 
british citizenship he estimated the total at 225000 
some 50 tory members pledged to vote against the measure when it 
is put to the house of commons in the spring another 20 to 30 
tories might abstain the british news agency press association 
estimated 
the conservatives have 374 seats in the 650seat commons labor 
has 229 
the governments decision has split the party from top to 
bottom tebbit said in an article he wrote for londons evening 
standard there is no doubt that in the cabinet itself the home 
secretary and the foreign secretary led bitterly opposed factions 
the word at present is that the final rebellion will be more 
like 50 than 100 
he said party officials who saw the danger of mrs 
thatchers policy failed to prevent such a folly 
speaking earlier on bbc radio tebbit said the residence rights 
would involve more than the number indicated by hurd it would mean 
wives and husbands sisters cousins aunts and grandmothers 
tebbit said 
about 325 million hong kong chinese have british passports but 
no residence rights 
earlier foreign office official francis maude repeated the 
governments aim was not to encourage immigration from hong kong 
but to allow key people to stay there under the chinese by giving 
them an escape route if they needed it

another lawyer henry grady smith of warner robins said he was 
surprised to learn that his name was on the return address of a 
package bomb sent to the naacp office in jacksonville fla that 
bomb was defused tuesday 
ive never represented their organization im not a civil 
rights attorney he said adding that he was interviewed by the 
fbi about the package tuesday 
ive never dealt with anybody in jacksonville i cant figure 
out why anybody would use my name 
earlier this week a government source said the bomb that killed 
us circuit judge robert s vance in birmingham ala on saturday 
bore the return address of a fellow judge who regularly sent vance 
packages 
fbi spokesman diader rosario in atlanta said agents have 
interviewed everyone whose name appeared on the parcels but we 
do not consider them suspects or involved in any way shape or 
form 
fbi agent jerry shockley of montgomery ala said the bombs 
the two fatal bombs plus unexploded ones found at the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals in atlanta and a naacp office in 
jacksonville fla may have been sent by a racist group in 
response to naacp school desegregation lawsuits 
mississippi lawyer richard barrett leader of a white 
supremacist group called the nationalist movement said he does not 
think anyone in his or similar groups is to blame 
i believe them to be the work of a deranged lunatic that is 
my first impression barrett said i think that the american 
people should not be stampeded by the liberal kneejerk hysteria 
that seems to be emanating from various quarters including the 
fbi 
the fbi today said it was installing 24hour tip lines in 
birmingham ala jacksonville fla and atlanta to seek clues in 
the investigation 
in birmingham a telephoned bomb threat today forced evacuation 
of a building that includes the office of the us bankruptcy court 
judge who gave the eulogy for vance on wednesday no explosive was 
found us marshal tom greene said 
national and local judicial figures were among more than 700 
mourners at a memorial service for vance in a church guarded by 
dozens of police officers and checked by dogs trained to smell for 
bombs 
vance a member of the 11th circuit and a former chairman of the 
alabama democratic party was killed instantly saturday in his home 
when he opened a package and the bomb exploded sending finishing 
nails into his lower abdomen the bomb also wounded his wife 
two days later another package bomb killed robert e robinson 
a black lawyer in savannah ga a third bomb was found was found in 
the court building that houses the 11th circuit in atlanta and a 
fourth in the headquarters of the naacp in jacksonsville fla 
those two bombs were defused 
us bankruptcy judge clifford fulford of birmingham delivered 
the eulogy for his close friend he asked the mourners to put 
aside our outrage for a while to honor vance 
the assassins were cheated if they thought that bob vance was 
afraid to die fulford said 
vances life fulford said was the antithesis of our grief a 
life of fullness and gusto 
he described vance as a strong believer in the law and a man 
who stood up for the underdog and the oppressed no wonder 
his assassins could not stand such a man in their presence

us troops today surrounded the 
nicaraguan and cuban embassies after rumors spread that gen manuel 
antonio noriega may have fled there during the us military 
invasion that toppled his regime 
the nicaraguan government immediately ordered its army to 
surround the us embassy in managua until the siege on its embassy 
ended 
us troops hunting for noriega gained control of all major 
panamanian military bases after sporadic fighting late wednesday 
and early today 
on wednesday night noriega tried to rally his supporters by 
making a brief radio address in which he vowed to win or die 
the generals loyalists apparently still held at least a dozen 
americans hostage armed thugs roamed through the capital today 
one day after the us attack on panama in which at least 18 
americans died 
after rumors spread that noriega or other members of the 
panamanian defense forces high command were in the nicaraguan and 
cuban embassies us troops in armored personnel carriers 
surrounded the two missions 
one armored personnel carrier driver had to ask a reporter for 
directions and a soldier laying concertina wire at the nicaraguan 
embassy said were just securing exits 
the nicaragua government which has fought the ussupported 
contra rebels for eight years ordered its troops to surround the 
us embassy in managua until us troops withdrew from the 
perimeter of its embassy in panama city 
several hours later state department spokesman richard boucher 
said that tanks or armored vehicles were surrounding the us 
embassy in managua there is some sort of activity like that 
going on he said in washington 
heavy fighting raged in the middleclass suburb of san miguelito 
just before dawn marked by machinegun fire grenade explosions 
and light artillery fire us aircraft and helicopters flew 
overhead and drew ground fire 
by daybreak today the fighting had ceased and us army troops 
patrolled the streets as many panamanians began looting shops once 
more there was no evidence us troops were trying to halt the 
looting 
us military officials said most of the fighting between 
pronoriega forces and american troops has subsided and that little 
real threat remains 
col ronald sconyers spokesman for the us southern command 
told a pool of pentagon reporters wednesday that much of the 
gunfire still being heard around the country is from roving bands 
of noriegas civilian dignity battalions who were just 
getting their last licks in 
meanwhile the panama canal opened today after closing 
wednesday the first time anything other than a landslide has 
forced the 75yearold canal to close the 43milelong waterway 
will be open only during daytime until at least the weekend the 
panama canal commission said in a statement from washington 
shortly before midnight wednesday a day of terror ended for 29 
americans and other foreigners at the marriott hotel when about 90 
paratroopers from the us 82nd airborne division secured the 
building after firefight 
armed panamanians had raided the hotel periodically and abducted 
guests eventually freeing all but two the hotels manager and a 
cbs news producer 
the hotel was cleared of guests today and there were reports 
that us soldiers were exchanging gunfire with noriega loyalists 
a marriott spokesman in washington said 
in addition the smithsonian institution said 11 scientists and 
technicians were missing from a research institute and believed 
taken hostage 
pentagon officials said finding american hostages is a primary 
concern 
noriega surfaced with an ominous message he said on a 
governmentrun fm radio station that he will now lead a guerrilla 
war against the united states 
were in trench warfare now and we will maintain the 
resistance he said we ask the world for help with men 
dignity and strength our slogan is to win or die not one step 
back 
the generals whereabouts could not be determined and it was 
unclear whether he had substantial forces under his command 
journalists recognized the voice on the radio wednesday night as 
noriegas 
in washington pentagon officials said troops may have to head 
into the jungle to pursue noriega units 
the united states was offering a 1 million reward for noriega 
and 150 for each firearm surrendered 
american forces appealed today in radio broadcasts for members 
of noriegas panamanian defense forces to surrender 
do not fight for a small group of drug traffickers remember 
the oath you took when you joined such an honorable institution as 
the defense forces one broadcast said in spanish your fellow 
citizens are asking your help to restore democracy 
pentagon officials said about 1500 usbased reinforcements 
were flown into the country late wednesday to assist an exhausted 
attack force and prepare to flush noriega loyalists out of panama 
city 
that effectively doubled to 24000 the number of us troops 
that had been in the country before president bush ordered 
operation just cause in a bid to topple the general who has 
been a thorn in the side of two us presidents 
bush initially ordered 9500 troops to panama to augment 13000 
at bases along the panama canal 
the bush administration declared the operation a military 
success at least 18 americans were dead 117 wounded and one 
missing also one american female dependent was killed 
noriegas president francisco rodriguez said more than 60 
panamanians had been killed and hundreds were wounded many of them 
civilians 
by late wednesday us troops controlled most panamanian bases 
and the government television station they had also knocked out a 
radio tower silencing the national network that had broadcast 
appeals for resistance and military messages 
bush said in a speech wednesday morning that he ordered the 
invasion to bring noriega to trial in the united states on 1988 
cocainetrafficking charges to protect the 35000 americans in 
panama and to restore democracy 
opposition leader guillermo endara winner of the may 7 
elections that were voided by the noriegacontrolled government 
was sworn in as president also sworn in were first vice president 
ricardo arias calderon and second vice president guillermo 
billy ford 
none surfaced by late wednesday however and a call for public 
demonstrations of support drew no visible reaction 
noriega declared friday that panama was in a state of war 
with washington and a us marine lieutenant was killed the next 
day in what american officials called an unprovoked shooting 
secretary of state james a baker iii claimed the administration 
had received unconfirmed reportes that noriega planned to order an 
attack on an american residential neighborhood in panama 
us forces began the attack by pounding panamanian military 
bases in and around the capital with mortar cannon and machinegun 
fire noriegas headquarters in the densely populated neighborhood 
of chorillo was gutted 
us troops took 150 panamanians prisoner and were holding them 
in an automobile storage lot a report from pentagon pool reporters 
said 
the us invasion was the biggest chapter in washingtons long 
war with noriega a career soldier who had a strong core of support 
among workingclass people and who seemed to delight in defying the 
mighty united states 
noriega survived two coup attempts from within his defense 
forces and washingtons best nonmilitary efforts to oust him 
including harsh economic sanctions that severely depressed the 
economy 
bush ordered the sanctions lifted wednesday and said he intended 
to turn over the panama canal as required under existing treaties

polands communist party is losing touch 
with a critical constituency the workers its leaders said 
thursday 
so few actual workers were elected as delegates to the partys 
crucial national congress set for next month that the leadership 
may issue special invitations said janusz bisztyga the central 
committee spokesman 
the share of workers is disquietingly low bisztyga said 
we have called on all party groups to work out a different 
solution 
the percentage of workers has not been calculated while delegate 
elections continue but the spokesman offered two examples of the 
problem the baltic province of slupsk with only one worker and 
two farmers among the 22 delegates and the central area of kielce 
with only four bluecollar workers among the 44 delegates 
the situation is dire for the party created for the 
proletariat said wieslaw veitz a sociologist and party member 
during a news conference called to discuss the congress which 
meets jan 27 
it is not that the party leadership is losing touch with the 
base in fact there is no contact with the base because if we had 
contact the situation would not be as it is now he said 
the communists iron grip on polands government and economy 
broke in the last year first they turned to the independent 
solidarity movement they had sought to crush seeking help with the 
economic crisis and social unrest then they suffered a stinging 
popular rejection during unprecedented democratic parliament 
elections leading to the east blocs first noncommunist prime 
minister and a solidarityled cabinet 
now huge government budget subsidies and tax exemptions that 
funded communist party activites are ceasing jan 1 while economic 
reform is radically reducing the role of the party in staterun 
industries and within four years the party will have to face 
fully free elections 
the party congress the 11th since the communists consolidated 
power in postwar poland may be its last in its current form 
struggling to retain a place in the nations political future the 
party is expected to adopt a new name and a program that will cast 
it as broadly leftist supporting parliamentary democracy 
today the partys future is being discussed by a narrow group 
of intelligentsia and lacks participation from the workers said 
zbigniew sobotka an alternate politburo member from the warsaw 
steel works 
if we are to discuss the future of the party we should give 
the floor to the people who have been most identified with the 
party so far he said 
we do not want a situation where after the congress there is 
no base of membership to support the reformed party 
a workers congress forum was created at factories in warsaw to 
generate interest in party issues among the workers who sobotka 
described as frustrated by slow party reform and the leadership 
in preparation for the congress new rules were established for 
more democratic election of the 1500 delegates previously 
participants were approved by party leaders 
but sobotka said that in the elections members of the 
intelligentsia have an advantage they are more eloquent than 
the workers 
among the alternatives being considered to bolster worker 
representation at the congress are inviting delegations from 
factories to speak to the session allowing factories to elect the 
guests and making them full delegates to the congress of any new 
party that is formed sobotka said 
also said zenon szoda a polish academy of science professor 
we do not confine ourselves to the working class we mean people 
who are gainfully employed we do not reject people who have 
production means private farmers private entrepreneurs 
the party has a membership of just under 21 million in a nation 
of 39 million down 1 million in the last decade and 35000 in the 
first half of 1989 according to an august report 
about 375 percent of the members are workers compared with 
521 percent who are members of the intelligentsia managers 
teachers and others whose jobs require higher education the rest 
are in agriculture 
the central committee reported in october that 72 percent of 
members favored changing the name charter and program of the party 
that was formed in 1948 the report said there were 70 proposals 
for a new name 
polish communists have been studying their hungarian 
counterparts who voted oct 7 to scrap the old party and replace 
it with a socialist one

officials have rejected an offer by an 
italian communist to buy a statue of vladimir i lenin that was 
removed from a public square after violent antisoviet 
demonstrations it was reported thursday 
robert napoleone a member of the italian communist party who 
owns a rome publishing house offered to give the 30foot monument 
a place worthy of a great revolutionary 
but the local government council in nowa huta the idustrial 
suburb built as a model socialist city in 1950s decided the statue 
cannot be the object of such a transaction according to the 
state news agency pap

was stressing in the offer his financial and political 
independence pap said 
demonstrators shouting soviets go home had tried to destroy 
the statue and clashed with police during protests in november and 
early december the statue was quietly removed the night of dec 10

a palestinian suspected in the bombing of 
pan am flight 103 was convicted thursday in a series of terrorist 
attacks in northern europe four years ago along with three 
codefendants 
the palestinian mohammed abu talb was sentenced to life in 
prison which in sweden generally means 20 years at most behind 
bars he is expected to be expelled after serving his time the 
court said 
the verdicts were delivered on the first anniversary of the 
bombing of flight 103 over lockerbie scotland which killed 270 
people 
a swedish newspaper thursday said new evidence had surfaced 
linking abu talb to the attack including a calendar found in his 
apartment with the date dec 21 circled 
abu talb a 35yearold former bodyguard in the radical 
palestine popular struggle front and codefendant marten imandi 
received life sentences for bombing the northwest orient airlines 
office in copenhagen in 1985 one person was killed and more than 
20 were wounded 
two brothers mahmoud and moustafa al mougrabi were given 
sentences of six years and one year respectively for their 
involvement in three attacks in copenhagen and amsterdam 
all the defendants were acquitted in a fourth incident in 
stockholm in 1986 the case was decided by a judicial panel 
the type of crime is extremely serious it is directed 
against the lives and property of innocent people society must 
react very strongly against such crimes said the court in its 
100page decision 
abu talbs attorney said he would appeal the conviction which 
was based largely on the testimony of mahmoud al mougrabi 
in addition to the northwest orient office the men were 
convicted in bombings at a cophenhagen synagogue where seven 
people were hurt and the offices of el al israel airlines in the 
danish capital and in amsterdam no one was injured in those 
explosions 
abu talb was arrested in may in connection with the attacks he 
came under suspicion in the lockerbie case after swedish 
investigators established he had been in malta about the time the 
lockerbie bomb may have been prepared the altitudesensitive bomb 
apparently was hidden in a radiocassette recorder which was 
placed in a suitcase and wrapped in clothing bought in malta 
abu talbs lawyer svenerik sjogren repeated his clients 
denial that he was involved in the flight 103 incident and said his 
trip to malta was for business 
last month police seized clothing from abu talbs home in 
uppsala about 40 miles north of stockholm to compare it with 
shreds found in lockerbie and with clothing from a boutique in 
malta 
sjogren has challenged the legality of the raid but he said he 
understood the clothing already had been flown to malta for 
analysis 
a swedish newspaper dagens nyheter reported thursday that 
scottish detectives were disappointed with the results of the 
examination in malta 
dagens nyheter said further evidence has surfaced linking abu 
talb with lockerbie police found a 1988 calendar with the date 
dec 21 circled it said 
after the police raid abu talbs wife also was recorded in a 
wiretapped telephone call warning another palestinian who was not 
identified to get rid of the clothes immediately the paper 
said police later seized a suitcase from the family she called 
the paper added 
abu talb came to sweden from syria with his wife and child on a 
false moroccan passport under the name of belaid massoud ben hadi 
he settled in uppsala and ran a store specializing in arabic foods 
and videotapes

dozens of guests hiding in a seaside 
luxury hotel cheered when a battalion of elite us airborne troops 
shot their way through a neighborhood to reach the building 
the troops arrival late wednesday night ended a day of terror 
for 30 to 40 guests and staff who had endured several raids and 
abductions by armed panamanians after the us assault to topple 
gen manuel antonio noriega 
the gunmen seized 15 people and all but two eventually were 
released jon meyersohn of cbs and daniel sarria the hotels 
resident manager were apparently still being held hostage early 
today 
lt col harry axson the battalion commander said his unit 
based several miles away in old panama had received direct orders 
from secretary of state james baker iii to secure the hotel within 
three hours they did it but not without several skirmishes with 
panamanian forces 
three american soldiers were wounded during the trek axson said 
he said he did not know if the combat was with members of the 
panamanian defense forces but that he believed at least some were 
members of dignity battalions bands of armed thugs loyal to 
noriega 
later today state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
denied that baker had ordered us forces to secure the hotel 
she said baker called defense secretary dick cheney twice to 
relay information on the situation at the hotel but any contention 
baker was issuing orders to the military is 100 percent erroneous 
and false she said 
guests first heard the sound of american aircraft and helicopter 
gunships overhead wednesday night then the crack of smallarms 
fire getting louder by the minute then came the voices but it 
wasnt clear who they belonged to 
finally about 90 members of the us 82nd airborne division 
marched in 
it was 1122 pm and the guests huddled together in two rooms 
cheered and applauded the troops 
the gis took the guests to the hotel casino handed out sodas 
cookies and crackers and settled in for the night as evacuation 
plans were made 
roger conners a marriott spokesman in washington dc said 
today that the panama city hotel has been cleared of all guests and 
employees and that the only occupants are us troops who have set 
up a command post he said an army captain who telephoned him 
reported that shots were being exchanged with panamanians 
apparently members of the dignity battalions 
axson a veteran of the 1983 grenada invasion said his troops 
had not rested since early monday morning but were in high spirits 
officials of the marriott corp said earlier wednesday they were 
pressing the us government to ensure the safety of guests at the 
400room hotel after the military assault to capture noriega 
roger conner a spokesman for bethesda mdbased marriott said 
most of the guests were journalists and airline workers along with 
a few business people 
at one point some hotel guests were so fearful of giving away 
their position that they refused to let three reporters make 
telephone calls for about four hours during the afternoon 
the first raid on the hotel by panamanians occurred shortly 
after the us military assault began around midnight tuesday 
armed men entered the hotel again about 1 pm by then a few 
guests had managed to flee but drivers were difficult to come by 
one driver fled when he learned his riders would be americans 
the hotel is popular with americans and is less than two miles

american businesses plan to boost capital 
spending in 1990 but the rate of increase is only a little more 
than half this years and includes the first decline in 
durablegoods investment since 1986 the government said thursday 
analysts saw the report as more evidence of manufacturing 
sluggishness 
according to a commerce department survey completed in november 
spending on new plants and equipment will total 4901 billion next 
year a 49 percent jump but less than the 85 percent increase in 
1989 spending over that in 1988 
the 49 percent rate of increase is the slowest since a 42 
percent advance in 1987 the department said 
the report said lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser for 
the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa forecasting group means 
capital spending is not going to be the contributing factor to 
the economy in 1990 at least not like it was for much of 
1989 
david jones an economist for aubrey g lanston amp co new york 
said the survey reflects the pattern of weakness that is 
concentrated in the manufacturing sector 
weve had weakness in manufacturing particularly in autos 
but thats spreading now to computers defenserelated 
industries jones said and thats causing business to turn 
more cautious 
in addition to a softness in orders for manufactured goods 
chimerine said corporate debt also is a factor in the slowing of 
capital spending 
a lot of companies are paying a lot of interest to service 
their debt chimerine said its squeezing profits so the 
report is no surprise they only question is will it get much 
weaker 
in the latest survey manufacturing companies said they planned 
a 14 percent increase in capital outlays to 1828 billion 
compared with a 73 percent increase to 1802 billion in 1989 
this includes a 15 percent decrease in plants that produce 
durable goods bigticket items expected to last more than three 
years and a 40 percent gain in companies producing nondurable 
goods the last decline in the durablegoods sector was a 67 
percent drop in 1986 
durablegoods plants increased their investments 42 percent in 
1989 and nondurable investments were up 10 percent 
companies engaged in mining transportation and other 
nonmanufacturing ventures indicated they would increase spending 
by 71 percent to 3073 billion compared with a gain of 92 
percent to 2869 billion this year 
before adjusting for inflation 1990 plant and equipment 
spending is expected to rise 64 percent to 505 billion in 1990 
the latest estimate for 1989 spending is 475 billion 103 percent 
more than in 1988

for the first time that anybody could 
remember romanian president nicolae ceausescu was interrupted at a 
public speech by boos and jeers that began a huge demonstration 
against him in bucharest thursday 
dressed in a black persian lamb hat with matching coat collar 
ceausesecu 71 was about three minutes into one of his typically 
rousing speeches when according to a yugoslav journalist in 
bucharest a crowd of young people quickly joined by hundreds of 
sympathizers marched close by 
all that viewers on state television and listeners on state 
radio knew of the demonstration was the muffled sound of boos and 
jeers before live broadcast abruptly stopped 
ceausescu romanias hardline leader for 24 years was midway 
through a sentence thanking the organizers of his own rally on the 
square in front of his official residence the elegant palace that 
until the communist takeover in 1947 housed the nations kings 
radio and tv quickly switched to stirring patriotic songs but 
hungarian tv showed more footage of a disconcerted ceausescu 
clearly aware something was amiss and a man advising him come 
inside 
three minutes later the broadcast resumed again catching 
ceausescu midway through a sentence this time a stirring appeal to 
defend the independence integrity and sovereignty of romania 
eastern europes longest surviving ruler has made many such 
appeals in his 24 years as the autocratic boss of romania 
the appeals are intended to touch the raw nerve of romanian 
nationalism long played upon by ceausescu in his vision of a great 
romania with himself as its undisputed greatest leader ever 
but the increasing hardships he has imposed on 23 million 
people and the reported massacre of unarmed civilians in the west 
romanian city of timisoara last weekend apparently have united 
ethnic hungarians germans and romanians in revolt 
according to reports from east bloc journalists in bucharest 
the crowd that interrupted ceausescus speech was undeterred by 
tear gas grenades 
about 25 minutes after his mass rally drew to a close thousands 
of mostly young people marched down the nearby central magheru 
boulevard chanting down with ceausescu and calling for the 
libertate or freedom that is coming to their east 
european and soviet neighbors 
submachine gunners and tanks tried to push the crowds back and 
bursts of automatic weapons fire were heard as the protesters moved 
toward an intersection ringed by the imposing buildings of the 
university the national theater and the 22story intercontinental 
hotel 
there according to a yugoslav journalist the crowd was 
encircled by tanks riot police troops and special security forces 
there was a lull in the shooting during which a bulgarian 
correspondent said elderly people entreated the security forces not 
to move against the protesters 
shouts of the army is with us rang out a hungarian 
correspondent said 
but then according to yugoslav journalist petar tomic of 
tanjug an armored vehicle ran over two students others who went 
to help were mown down with gunshots with about 20 people killed 
or wounded 
a british diplomat told television in london that at least eight 
or nine corpses were seen in the streets 
elsewhere the city was quiet according to a swiss diplomat 
interviewed by swiss radio the airport and outskirts while 
heavily patrolled by security forces seemed untouched by the furor 
in the center he reported 
romanians who listened to their own media would have known 
nothing radio retransmitted ceausescus speech editing out the 
offending jeers television which normally transmits only two 
hours a night in the shortageplagued balkan nation simply did not 
start its usual 8 pm broadcast the soviet news agency tass said 
radio free europe broadcasts in romanian and the station is a 
lifeline to the rest of the world in a country that now receives 
few western visitors and sells no foreign newspapers not even 
those of its allies in the warsaw pact 
some have adjusted their tv antennas to receive hungarian 
yugoslav soviet or bulgarian news

tiny tim appeared before the city 
commission and tiptoed his way through an endorsement of a 
sculptors effort to live in a storefront studio 
local artists figured the 1960s celebrity could help sculptor 
darien bogart persuade city commissioners wednesday to let bogart 
live in a downtown studio 
tiny tim who is in town for club performances was glad to 
oblige he even stopped to serenade passersby plucking his ukulele 
on the steps of city hall 
but as tiny tim stood before the city commission dressed in a 
multicolored coat and a red white and blue striped tie his 
support of bogart wavered 
im supportive with a lot of ifs tiny tim said 
it might be all right if bogart kept the place clean and didnt 
bother neighboring businesses he said 
but later i cant see him living in a store that is on a main 
thoroughfare the danger there also is that others may follow suit 
to make it a thing to spread right now it appears to be out of 
taste 
commissioners decided to research the issue and reconsider it in 
february

farmers are closing out one of the best 
years ever but will be subject to pivotal decisions in 1990 by 
congress and international trade negotiators agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter said thursday 
yeutter said 1989 income reached nearrecord levels 
agricultural exports have improved and the farmcredit situation 
has eased for both lenders and borrowers 
net farm income will be either at or near a record for 1989 
he said the numbers are not fully determined yet but certainly 
its been a very good year for american agriculture one of the 
best ever 
most questions at yeutters yearend news conference related to 
the uruguay round trade negotations under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade or gatt those talks are scheduled to conclude a 
year from now 
yeutter was asked if he thought there would be a freer 
international market by 1999 one of the goals sought by us 
negotiators particularly for agricultural products 
my personal assessment is that we have the best chance for 
significant trade liberalization in agriculture that weve 
experienced since the gatt began 40 years ago he replied 
i do believe itll be a freer market 10 years from now than it 
is today and i also believe firmly that that will work to the 
advantage of the american farmer 
other questions related to legislation being drafted by congress 
to succeed the 1985 farm law that expires next year yeutter said 
teams of agriculture department experts are working on plans for 
the 1990 farm bill but did not divulge details 
the united states at the gatt talks has sought a gradual 
reduction and eventual elimination of all tradedistorting 
subsidies and policies but administration officials have adamantly 
insisted that no us programs would be scrapped unless other 
countries did likewise 
though we may want to make some changes in all of these 
programs in the 1990 farm bill because those may be desirable in 
their own right were not going to unilaterally disarm 
internationally in that legislation yeutter said 
so whether were talking about sugar the wheat program or 
any other program i determined that we not forgo any of our 
negotiating leverage in that 1990 legislative debate he said 
but at the same time i am not prepared to accept the arguments 
of any individual industry to the effect that says all changes in 
the program are offlimits 
yeutter who joined president bushs cabinet in january was 
us trade representative in the reagan administration and has been 
in the thick of uruguay round negotiations since they began sept 
20 1986 in punta del esta uruguay 
im always an optimist as you know he said about the final 
push during talks in 1990 but certainly i do not underestimate 
the negotiating challenge it will be significant indeed 
yeutter said it would require an immense amount of effort and 
a strong political commitment on the part of the united states 
the european economic community japan the developing countries 
and others to bring the gatt talks to a close a year from now 
the private sector including farm groups also will be 
important in reaching us objectives during the negotiations he 
said 
they can disagree about tactics or they can disagree about 
particular nuances of the program yeutter said but its 
important that we have broad support for our fundamental 
objectives

and litter 
the 35 boys and girls in the camp fire group were joined by 
volunteers in raising 20000 for the project through bake sales 
spaghetti feeds raffles turkey bingo and other fundraisers 
the lot was cleared and materials were donated to turn it into 
the sprague centennial plaza complete with gazebo trees and 
grass a 100foot mural of 270 painted tiles tells the history of 
the town 35 miles southwest of spokane 
i get weepy when i even talk about it said gladys engles 
80 theres more spirit and more christmas lights in sprague this 
year than ever

in a shantytown named brooklyn and in 
a half dozen other slums hundreds of people set up shop on the 
sidewalks thursday with merchandise looted from the rich stores 
they were hawking everything from designer brassieres to 
french champagne and gucci watches all at bargainbasement prices 
the alleys of the slum called brooklyn were crowded with buyers 
and sellers haggling and bargaining while the wealthy stores on 
avenida espana panama citys main thoroughfare were stripped bare 
all day wednesday while fighting raged between us troops and 
defense forces loyal to strongman gen manuel antonio noriega mobs 
out of the dirtpoor barrios invaded calidonia avenida central 
transistmica supercentros almanecenes and other stores 
they carried off everything from tvs and stereos to cellular 
phones mattresses and even huge refrigerators and washing 
machines from clothes to desingner shoes and barbie dolls 
some even set up shop in the doorways of their wooden shacks 
many people deplored the massive robbery and said they were 
ashamed of it but for a neighborhood such as brooklyn it appeared 
to be a christmas boon virtually all the residents are without 
work 
they lost their jobs when the us imposed a trade embargo last 
year one of a series of bush administration measures to pressure 
noriega out of power plunging panama into a severe economic crisis 
he doesnt have any running shoes for me but i ordered a pair 
for tomorrow a buyer about 50 years old explained to a 
visiting reporter pointing to one of the stall vendors 
itll be only 5 another vendor nearby said as he draped a 
girls dress over his arm trying to convince a prospective client 
too expensive said the client a housewife they started 
haggling she like almost all panamanians these days did not want 
to give their names 
one small house was filled with women buyers the owner was 
selling designer brassieres at 2 apiece the buyers rummaged 
through boxes full of them looking for their sizes 
at another store men jostled each other trying to buy some 
of the best brand shaving lotions and perfumes at a fraction of 
the regular price 
look a young man said proudly showing a visiting reporter 
a gold watch i bought it for 20 the salesman didnt even 
realize it is a gucci 
a middleaged matron doing her christmas shopping was all 
smiles i bought it for 8 she said pointing to an imported 
turkey that costs at least 40 in regular stores 
but another woman about her age looking down at the scene from 
a nearby balcony shook her head in dismany it makes feel like 
sitting down and crying she said sadly as a couple of handcarts 
were dragged down the street full of looted merchandise 
one of the carts even had pieces of furniture 
this is horrible i prefer to continue being poor i just 
dont like this said another woman in los libertadores another 
shanty neighborhood 
a little girl of about eight ran by carrying three boxes full 
of clothes for a barbie doll her brother had given her as a present 
im scared im trembling i couldnt keep my son from going

the measles explosion of 1989 involving 
unvaccinated preschoolers and schoolchildren whose shots didnt 
work has been accompanied by the most measles deaths in 18 years 
federal health officials said thursday 
fortytwo deaths from measles have been reported this year said 
national centers for disease control measles specialist dr william 
l atkinson thats the largest death count since 90 in 1971 he 
noted 
nationwide 14714 measles cases were counted with two weeks 
left in the year the cdc said in its weekly report thats more 
than five times the 2876 cases reported at this point a year ago 
an analysis of measles cases in the first six months of this 
year shows 30 percent occurred in children under 5 who are too 
young to fall under schoolvaccination laws fiftyone percent 
occurred among young people 519 
in the wake of the new measles explosion cdc researchers have 
recommended this year that children get vaccinated twice the 
initial dose at 15 months in most areas then again at school 
entry ages 46 
in the first half of this year 51 percent of measles cases 
occurred among people who were believed appropriately 
vaccinated the atlantabased cdc said 
the unvaccinated preschoolers present a separate problem 
atkinson noted 
weve got to find some sort of clever ways to motivate parents 
to get their kids vaccinated he said a 15monthold doesnt 
walk in on his own 
large measles outbreaks are continuing in los angeles chicago 
and houston primarily among young blacks and hispanics the cdc 
noted vaccination rates in some inner cities are as low as 49 
percent in 2yearolds the agency said 
federal health officials believed measles eradication was within 
reach early in this decade just 1497 cases were reported in 1983 
but the disease has bounced back although still nowhere near the 
prevaccine levels of half a million cases a year 
during 1971 when 90 patients died 75290 cases were reported

the federal budget deficit increased 2896 
billion in november raising the imbalance during the first two 
months of the fiscal year to more than half the ceiling for the 
entire year the treasury department said thursday 
combined with the october deficit of 2609 billion the 
imbalance totaled 5505 billion the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law sets a 100 billion ceiling for the fiscal year that 
began oct 1 
while the deficit is growing at a slower rate than during the 
last fiscal year it will have to slow substantially in subsequent 
months to meet the grammrudman limit 
the november deficit was 11 percent more than that posted in 
october but 06 percent less than the 2913 billion november 
imbalance a year ago 
the deficit for the first two months of fiscal 1990 was 19 
percent less than the 5614 billion recorded in octobernovember 
of fiscal 1989 
the deficit for fiscal 1989 totaled 1521 billion 
president bush on tuesday signed a deficit reduction bill that 
would trim spending by 147 billion with a goal of reducing this 
years deficit to about 103 billion according to supporters of 
the measure 
however private economists said that estimate was based on 
optimistic assumptions and that the actual deficit for the current 
budget year is likely to be well above that figure 
the congressional budget office estimates the deficit actually 
will be 128 billion despite the bill signed tuesday 
revenue last month totaled 7121 billion 107 percent above 
the same month of 1989 while spending rose 72 percent to 10017 
billion the deficit is the difference between revenue and spending 
as usual the biggest spending categories were for the military 
social security and other programs in the department of health and 
human services and interest on the national debt 
military spending totaled 2457 billion in november and 4374 
billion so far this year it is projected to total 28689 billion 
for the entire fiscal year 
social security payments amounted to 1975 billion last month 
and 3961 billion so far this year it is projected to total 
24295 billion for the year 
other hhs programs including medicare and medicaid totaled 
1428 billion in november and 2763 billion so far this year and 
are projected to total 19017 billion for the year 
interest on the national debt amounted to 2020 billion in 
november and 3666 billion so far this year and is projected to

martin wenick executive director of the us organization 
national conference on soviet jewry said the news about the 
refuseniks those jews repeatedly refused permission to emigrate 
came from anatoly adamishin a deputy foreign minister 
adamishin told wenick and other representatives of the us 
group a substantial number of the refuseniks who had been 
barred from emigrating because of access to state secrets would be 
told soon they could leave 
a western diplomat who follows the refusenik issue said he had 
heard the same report but cautioned that the soviets had not 
officially notified the refuseniks of the news we hope its true 
but lets wait and see said the diplomat 
emigration of soviet jews has reached record levels under 
president mikhail s gorbachevs liberalized policies an alltime

hungary 
refuseniks remain however and problems of emigration have been 
a central topic at the conference of soviet jews that began monday 
and ends friday 
a draft resolution to be voted on friday welcomes progress made 
so far in emigration but says the number of refuseniks has remained 
stable at about 250 families 100 of them refused on secrecy 
grounds the resolution also criticizes a draft law on emigration 
and travel as overly vague and says it contains infringements on 
the political economic and social rights of citizens 
the meeting was organized by more than 160 jewish organizations 
in 75 cities and marked the first time since 1920 that jewish 
leaders were allowed to openly congregate to establish a national 
organization 
the countrys biggest jewish group the jewish bund was founded 
by jewish socialists in 1897 but disbanded in 1920 
former refuseniks now living abroad deputies from the soviet 
parliament and about 150 jewish leaders from the west were among 
the 650 people attending the conference 
but soviet officials denied a visa to jewish activist natan 
sharansky who spent nine years in soviet labor camps before 
emigrating to israel in 1986 
the conference also was scheduled to adopt a resolution saying 
antisemitism is growing in the soviet union and delegates 
expressed concern about two protest groups that have been 
demonstrating outside the cinema center 
as the conference opened about 60 jeering members of the 
russian nationalist pamyat society jostled delegates as they tried 
to enter the hall 
they waved signs saying zionists out of the ussr and 
jews get out of the union 
on thursday several dozen palestinian students demonstrators 
marched outside they carried a picture of palestine liberation 
organization chief yasser arafat and signs that read plo 
israel no and zionism wont go through

party ranks are to be delivered at a regular party congress in 
may altogether 32 officials will be investigated hora told 
reporters on the final day of the congress 
husak and other hardliners installed after the 1968 crackdown

the communist partys 41year monopoly on power and led to a 
government dominated by noncommunists 
former ideology chief vasil bilak was expelled thursday as a 
representative of forces who initiated the invasion of 1968

four weeks before losing it wednesday

politburo member vasil mohorita was chosen first secretary the two 
new positions share the powers once wielded by the allpowerful 
secretarygeneral

roving bands of noriega loyalists 
getting their last licks in shot from the rooftops and the 
us ambassador predicted life in panama will continue to be 
dangerous for some time 
a continuing firefight prevented a helicopter from dropping off 
a small us media contingent at patilla airport the chopper 
touched down briefly but was waved off 
reporters saw american soldiers pressed behind concrete walls 
and running between buildings near the control tower officials 
said there were snipers on rooftops in the area 
military officials of the southern command confirmed that a 
journalist had been killed near the marriott hotel but could not 
say immediately who it was 
however spanish ambassador tomas lozano said juan antonio 
rodriquez a photographer for spains largest newspaper el pais 
was killed thursday during a cross fire between us troops in the 
hotel parking lot 
troops from the 82nd airborne division freed 29 us citizens 
and 35 foreign nationals from the marriott where they had been 
trapped for 36 hours since the military operation began early 
wednesday military officials said 
us ambassador arthur davis back in panama after a sevenmonth 
absence predicted there would be retaliation from troops loyal to 
gen manuel antonio noriega who was ousted by us forces 
i think this is a very difficult time for security because of 
retaliation davis said 
the ambassador left panama in may the day after noriega voided 
elections observers said he lost davis said he was bringing an 
economic recovery proposal to panamas new leaders including the 
700 million in assets freed by presidents bushs decision to lift 
economic sanctions 
the sporadic gunfire in panama was attributed by us military 
officials to roving bands of noriega loyalists getting their last 
licks in rather than to fighting between noriega forces and 
american troops 
panamanian civilian leaders had wanted panamanian forces not 
those from the united states to oust noriega but john bushnell 
the us charge daffaires said that after a failed coup oct 3 
there was a feeling that well there werent many more 
panamanians left with guns that might do it so it was becoming a 
hopeless situation 
they never said it so many words we wish you would really 
send the 82nd airborne to do it but they clearly indicated their 
frustration that if we didnt the situation was just going to go 
on and get worse bushnell said 
the new leaders main concern he said was that if noriega were 
shot another panamanian defense force colonel might take his place 
indeed it was by pretending that noriega had been killed us 
soldiers bluffed panamanian soldiers into freeing two american 
women held hostage more than six hours in an airport terminal 
mary rebhan 24 of hollywood fla and tara king 25 of 
dallas told reporters they were used as shields by 30 armed 
noriega loyalists who holed up in a sweltering customs room at omar 
torrijos international airport when american forces moved in 
the two women had gone to the airport tuesday evening to pick up 
rebhans brother flying in for her wedding at the end of the month 
they had us in choke holds for most of the time rebhan said 
they made us kneel down and held guns to my back and to her 
head king said 
american troops began to arrive in force to take over the 
airport but the panamanians held them off with the women 
for six hours they made us keep shouting go away were 
americans theyre going to kill us and the children if you 
come rebhan said 
just before dawn the americans set a deadline of 630 am for 
the men to surrender and told them they were surrounded and that 
noriega was already dead in fact noriegas whereabouts was not 
known 
the panamanians gave up leaving the room with the women held in 
front of them

here is the transcript of president bushs 
news conference thursday afternoon 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
president bush i have a brief statement to be followed by a 
brief press conference because i have a pain in the neck 
laughter seriously 
q why 
president bush thats your first question 
q no laughter 
president bush okay ill go ahead well our efforts to 
support the democratic processes in panama and to ensure continued 
safety of american citizens is now moving into its second day im 
gratified by the decision and effect of the precision and the 
effectiveness of the military forces in achieving their objectives 
im pleased that the endara government is taking charge and they 
made several appointments today starting to govern the country 
the young men and women involved in the exercise have 
demonstrated the highest standards of courage and excellence in 
defending americas interest and protecting american life they 
have been outstanding in carrying out the mission of our nation 
there has been and they have sustained a tragic loss of life 
military casualties are a burden which a nation must endure and all 
presidents have to face up to but which we can never accept and 
maybe its just this time of year but i dont think so but 
particularly just a second particularly at this time of year 
my heart goes out to the families of those who have died in panama 
those who have been wounded 
this operation is not over but its pretty well wrapped up and 
weve moved aggressively to neutralize the pdf panamanian defense 
forces to provide a stable environment for the freely elected 
endara government and i mentioned that it helps to ensure the 
integrity of the panama canal and to create an environment that is 
safe for american citizens 
gen noriega is no longer in power he no longer commands the 
instruments of government or the forces of repression that hes 
used for so long to brutalize the panamanian people and we are 
continuing the efforts to apprehend him see that hes brought to 
justice 
i appreciate the support that weve received strong support 
from the united states congress from our latin american neighbors 
from our allies from the american people and its always 
difficult to order forces into battle but that difficulty is 
mitigated by the moral and personal support that is granted by our 
friends and allies 
youve received detailed briefings from the pentagon on the 
logistical aspects and i might say that i think secretary of 
defense dick cheney and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
gen colin powell have done and ably assisted by others have 
done an outstanding job of keeping the american people informed 
i wanted you to know that as we move into the days ahead we 
will continue to support the endara government to help establish 
stability in the country to allow those desires for freedom and 
democracy to flourish 
and ill be glad to take some questions

at least 26 american aids patients have been 
given bone marrow transplants as a possible cure but at least 10 
have died and the rest have shown only temporary improvement 
researchers say 
interest in these apparent failures was sparked by a report from 
johns hopkins university that a bone marrow transplant combined 
with the antiaids drug azt might have eliminated the aids virus 
from one patient the patient died before the researchers could be 
certain the virus was gone 
the hopkins case was widely reported in june when it was 
announced at an international aids meeting in montreal the case 
received renewed attention this week when it was described in the 
new york times 
on wednesday dr clifford lane of the national institute of 
allergy and infectious diseases said his study of 16 patients 
produced 16 failures he found only transient improvement in 
immunity in patients getting azt and bone marrow transplants 
lanes study used identical twins so that a perfect bone marrow 
match could be obtained for each patient from his twin the hopkins 
study did not use twins and so it was necessary to destroy or 
ablate the patients immune system with chemotherapy and 
radiation before the transplant 
lane said at least 10 other us aids patients had received 
transplants after their immune systems were ablated with 
exceedingly poor results 
every case i know of where the recipient was ablated the 
recipient died lane said that includes the hopkins patient 
there are lots of us who havent published our results because 
theyve been so dismal said dr ronald mitsuyasu of the 
university of california los angeles who has handled four such 
cases all we can say is that its an interesting concept and 
that additional patients will need to be studied 
bone marrow transplantation used most commonly to treat rare 
genetic immune disorders and certain forms of cancer is risky and 
expensive the cost averages about 125000 and 35 percent to 40 
percent of recipients over age 35 die from the procedure said dr 
richard oreilly chief of bone marrow transplantation at memorial 
sloankettering cancer center in new york the mortality rate drops 
below 15 percent in children he said 
it is unlikely therefore that the technique could be used on a 
large scale to treat patients some researchers said you have to 
be young you have to be rich and you have to be willing to risk a 
oneinfour chance that the cure will kill you said dr mark 
jacobson an aids specialist at the university of california san 
francisco 
in lanes study done in collaboration with dr anthony fauci 
director of the allergy institute azt did not prevent the virus 
from infecting transplanted bone marrow as the researchers had 
hoped it might planned studies using different aids drugs might be 
more successful lane said 
the hopkins team led by dr rein saral used drugs and 
radiation to wipe out the immune system of a 41yearold aids 
patient with lymphoma a form of cancer they then gave him azt and 
a bone marrow transplant thirtyfive days later they used a 
sensitive test called polymerase chain reaction or pcr to search 
for the aids virus in his body they found no evidence of it 
the patient died of the lymphoma 47 days after the transplant 
tests again failed to show the virus in his blood or in various 
tissue samples but researchers couldnt be sure the virus was 
eliminated 
the virus could be there but in such small numbers that we 
couldnt detect it said dr h kent holland a member of the 
hopkins team its possible there was no virus thats all we 
can say

q mr president one of your major objectives was to get 
noriega are you frustrated that he got away how long will you 
keep on chasing him and are you confident that youll get him 
a ive been frustrated that hes been in power this long 
extraordinarily frustrated the good news hes out of power the 
bad news he has not yet been brought to justice so id have to 
say terry there is a certain level of frustration on that 
account the good news though is that the governments beginning 
to function and the man controls no forces and hes out but 
yes i wont be satisfied until we see him come to justice 
q how long will you keep up your fullscale pursuit 
a as long as it takes 
q mr president you did mention the casualties did you expect 
them to be so high on both sides i mean 
a we had some very 
q and also was it it really worth it to send people to their 
death for this to get noriega 
a we had some estimates helen on the casualties ahead of 
time but not in numbers i mean it was more general that 
look mr president no way can you do an operation this large 
and not have american casualties so the defense department was 
very up front with us about that and every human life is precious 
and yet i have to answer yes it has been worth it 
david 
q mr president 
a no david brit and wyatt and john 
q a few months ago you said your complaint was not with the 
pdf not with the panamanian people but with noriega only you 
also said only a month ago that you didnt think it would be 
prudent to launch a largescale military operation what changed 
your mind and particularly why did you opt for the maximum use of 
force in this situation 
a i think what changed my mind was the events that i cited in 
briefing the american people on this yesterday the death of the 
marine the brutalizing really obscene torture of the navy 
lieutenant and the threat of sexual abuse and the terror inflicted 
on that navy lieutenants wife the declaration of war by noriega 
the fact that our people down there felt that they didnt know 
where this was going and they werent sure what all that meant and 
whether that meant we could guarantee the safety of americans there 
and so i made a decision to move and to move with enough force 
this was the recommendation of the pentagon to be sure that we 
minimized the loss of life on both sides and that we took out the 
pdf which we did took it out promptly and so i would like to 
think that what i said some time ago still stands 
im not sure whats left on the ground in terms of people but 
what david hoffman is referring to is that i said our argument was 
not with the pdf but with noriega and if they would get rid of 
him and recognize a democratically elected government we could go 
back to more normalized relations weve done that but we have to 
see who emerges in the pdf but i would like to repeat here that we 
have no continuing ax to grind with the institution of the pdf 
endaras going to need loyal troops who recognize the constitution 
and the fairness and the legitimacy of his election

pony rides and petting zoos exploit 
animals and must be banned from public property the city 
commission decided in a move praised by animalrights activists 
i think petting zoos are terrible vice mayor guy roper said 
before wednesdays vote while a lot of children have probably 
gone and petted the cute little bunnies at a petting zoo little 
children may not realize when they grab them they might be 
breaking an ear or putting a finger in the eye 
animal rights activists and members of the humane society of 
broward county told commissioners the ordinance would prevent some 
animal abuse 
but some people feared the ban would deprive children from 
learning about animals 
most of you have had your picture taken on a pony with a 
cowboy hat on is that going to be against the law asked henry 
harbinson 
commissioners gave initial approval to the ordinance but asked 
city attorney maria chiaro to rewrite it to make it more specific 
as approved wednesday the law allows animal exhibits for 
educational purposes only

newly revised income figures by the 
agriculture department show that farmers havent been making as 
much money the last few years as agency economists had been 
reporting 
the economic research service the departments professional 
agency that keeps the financial books on agriculture on wednesday 
issued revised estimates reflecting higher expenses than had been 
used in the earlier computations 
it doesnt change what actually happened of course said 
agency economist greg gajewski it changes our perception but 
i cant see that it changes the direction of anything 
one of the effects was to reduce the net cash income of farmers 
the money left over after deducting cash expenses from gross cash 
proceeds during the calendar year it includes government payments 
and proceeds from crops grown in earlier years 
the revisions based on 1987 figures from the federal census of 
agriculture showed that net cash income in 1987 was 545 billion 
instead of the 577 billion reported as recently as a month ago 
in 1988 according to the revisions net cash income of farmers 
rose to 572 billion not to the 599 billion stated previously 
this year according to the agencys new report the net cash 
income of farmers may be in the range of 52 billion to 57 
billion that is unchanged from the earlier forecast 
gajewski who oversees preparation of the monthly report said 
that the 1987 census benchmark now being used showed that farm 
expenses turn out about 3 percent higher than had been estimated 
earlier 
it suggests farmers did a little less well than we thought 
they were doing gajewski said in a telephone interview 
but he noted that despite the downward revisions the new income 
numbers for those years are still records and that the rebound 
from the financial crisis is still very real 
the revised figures also prompted changes in another method of 
farm accounting used by the agency that involves net farm 
income which measures the value of production including federal 
payments in a specific year changes in the value of crop and 
livestock inventories are part of the annual accounting 
under this method net farm income in 1987 was 435 billion 
instead of the 471 billion reported previously in 1988 net farm 
income was revised to 427 billion from 457 billion 
this years estimate was pegged at 48 billion instead of in a 
range of 48 billion to 53 billion used a month ago 
gajewski said the revisions are part of the profession of 
economics and are done regularly year after year 
when the government stops revising numbers thats when you 
have to start really worrying he said to some extent it take 
a lot of courage to go back and lower income numbers

china on thursday praised president bush for 
easing economic sanctions saying the measures would help restore 
normal relations 
bushs actions were positive steps helpful to the 
normalization of relations between china and the united states 
said foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua we welcome this 
bush this week exempted from economic sanctions the export of 
three communications satellites to be launched by china and 
sanctioned exportimport bank credit to companies doing business in 
china 
the relaxation of sanctions followed a dec 910 visit to 
beijing by national security adviser brent scowcroft that ended a 
us ban on highlevel exchanges between the two sides 
the bush administration which imposed the sanctions after the 
bloody military attack on studentled prodemocracy demonstrators 
this june has been criticized for being too friendly to beijings 
hardline leaders 
white house officials said the decision to allow china to launch 
satellites for australian and hong kong firms and the waiving of 
restrictions on lowinterest exim bank loans to americans 
investing in china were in the national interest 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the sale of the 
satellites will bring 300 million worth of business to us firms 
jin declined comment on whether bushs actions would help settle 
other outstanding issues particularly that of fang lizhi the 
outspoken dissident who has been hiding in the us embassy in 
beijing since june 
jin repeated the chinese position that fangs future is a 
sensitive question that must be solved through joint efforts of 
the two sides 
jin also reread a foreign ministry statement issued earlier 
condemning us military action in panama saying it was 
interference in the internal affairs of another country and a 
violation of international law 
on saturday a senior soviet communist party official arrives 
for a visit to include talks between the two largest marxist 
nations on the crisis in world communism 
the crumbling of oneparty communist rule in eastern europe is 
certain to be on the agenda during the weeklong visit of valentin 
falin head of the decisionmaking central committees 
international department a soviet embassy official said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
chinese are unhappy with events in eastern europe and are eager to 
sound out the soviets on their approach to the popular groundswell 
of opposition to communist rule 
the official said the chinese have also expressed concern about 
growing turmoil in romania east europes most stubborn holdout 
against political reform and a staunch ally of china since its 
military crackdown 
on bilateral matters falin will discuss how to improve 
partytoparty relations following the may visit of president 
mikhail s gorbachev which ended a 30year freeze in sinosoviet 
party contacts 
falin has asked to meet party general secretary jiang zemin and 
a favorable response from the chinese would indicate their 
willingness to move party relations to a higher plane the official 
said 
the two sides may touch on a planned visit by premier li peng to 
moscow tentatively set for next april 
the official said overall sinosoviet relations have generally 
progressed well since the gorbachev visit in spite of the june 
turmoil in china and divergences in views on political reform 
he said there were so many soviet delegations visiting china 
that the embassy could no longer handle them all trade along the 
oncetense border is booming and total bilateral trade is expected 
to increase substantially from last years 325 billion 
the official china daily said thursday that the two countries 
are now discussing cooperation in a 46 million project to build 
chinas first coal slurry pipeline 
soviet officials acknowledge however that chinas top priority 
is still obtaining western technology and chinas strained 
relations with the west will not result in a sharp increase in 
sinosoviet economic exchanges 
the soviet union the official said hopes better relations with 
china will facilitate multinational development of siberias rich 
natural resources with chinese laborers being brought in for 
projects backed by japanese us and south korean technology and 
financing

q mr president in light of what youve said about the endara 
government getting started the need for stability the need for 
some kind of police action down there we really are in a kind of 
an openended military occupation there arent we sir 
a well i wouldnt say its openended except its openended 
as far as going after noriega openended in terms of the 
restoration of order in panama cleaning up a few elements 
ragtag elements of this socalled dignity battalion if you 
ever talk about a misnomer thats it dignity battalion 
going after them the pdf units have pretty been rolled up but 
we will keep whatever force is necessary there until our military 
are satisfied and recommend to the president that they be 
withdrawn i want them out of there as soon as possible 
q mr president just to follow up if i could sir in he 
planning of this operation surely you must have recognized that 
these actions would be needed and some force would have to be on 
the ground there for awhile what estimate did you have as you 
undertook this operation as to how long it would take 
a brit no day number of day estimate was given to me i 
think everyone recognized some of that would depend on when noriega 
was brought to justice some of that dependent on how a 
restructured pdf behaved 
q mr president what do you know about americans held against 
their will and what are you doing now to free them 
a im looking for help on that because we dont have a count 
and if there are a lot of them we dont know about it but i just 
had a briefing i dont know whether cheneys still here 
q well the pentagon said sir there were 12 open cases 
a well ill tell you that included probably those smithsonian 
people who have now been released and i think there may have been 
9 or 10 of those so but id just have to get marlin to get back 
to you 
q well does that indicate that thats not a priority in the 
reporting to you 
a no it indicates to me that its very hard to know whats 
going on when theres a firefight and a battle because we heard 
all kind of rumors we had calls from your network your chairman 
of the board urging us to go in and take the some laughter 
take the no he did and i understand it he had a reporter that 
he a producer that he felt was held weve gone there that place 
is secure im told but i dont know that we can tell him this 
minute about that the life of that individual but we will keep 
on going till we can tell him about the life of that individual 
theres been an awful lot of interest in the marriott hotel 
but im very pleased to say that it is secure and weve had heads 
of corporations weve had news organizations other than his 
concerned about their people and we must be as responsive as we 
can 
yeah john and then charles 
q we are hearing were hearing that american 
a then ellen 
q troops and tanks have surrounded the cuban and nicaraguan 
embassies in panama city and that in managua the nicaraguans have 
retaliated by surrounding our embassy there with their own tanks 
are you hearing the same thing 
a we were told that is not true 
q that is not true 
a yeah as of a briefing i just had 
charles 
q mr president youve referred to the elected government of 
mr endara as you know there was never an accurate final count 
that confirmed that even though most polls suggested he had 
probably won by a 3to1 margin in talking with him or in the 
future have you encouraged or would you encourage him to seek 
again elections that would verify that he indeed or whoever would 
be a legally elected president 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO> AP891221-0122 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
a i would encourage as much as their constitution calls for 
but the election of endara was as you point out so overwhelming 
the vote count so high that i dont think anybody can suggest 
somebody else might well have won that election 
q but mr president what i pointed out was that it was never 
final and it was never verified it was 
a well because it was aborted by this dictator noriega 
maximum leader so decreed three days ago but he was acting 
like maximum leader before that thwarting frustrating the will of 
the panamanian people so i think the international community that 
oversaw those elections including a former president of the united 
states felt that it went pretty well 
yeah on the aisle 
q mr president if i can go back 
a then ellen 
q to the question 
a excuse me you go ahead and then i got to go to ellen 
q if i can go back to the question of hostages they say that 
you anticipated noriega might escape the initial assault and so 
there were plans to go after him where are your priorities sir 
in getting manuel noriega or in dealing with the americans who 
might be held because if you get noriega the americans may still 
be held 
a and if we get noriega in quite a pretty much likelihood 
theyll be released unless somebody wants to use a held american as 
a ticket to get out of town so were doing both we are 
concentrating every way we possibly can to find noriega and that 
is not drawing down here is my answer it is not drawing down on 
the assets that we have available to safeguard the lives of 
americans they are not mutually exclusive 
ellen 
q sir why is it that tens of thousands of american fighting 
men and with all of our intelligence we are still 
a ellen 
q unable to catch one bad guy from panama 
a because intelligence is imperfect ellen 
q and sir did we did we make an effort 
a its good sometimes its certain counting numbers very 
sure intention of a person to be someplace or move very 
difficult but its still sophisticated i am convinced weve got 
the best but thats why it is imperfect 
q a followup sir had you made an effort prior to the 
invasion to go down and capture general noreiga 
a have i no ive been right here on the job scattered 
laughter 
yeah 
q had the administration sir had our people had americans 
made an effort to do so 
a have was there some operation you mean not that i know of 
yeah in the middle 
q what was the 
a i was thinking of the lady next to you but go ahead and then 
well go again 
q what led you to approve 
a youre next youre next 
q what led you to approve of the decision to have a bounty on 
noriega and is this the type of thing that we will be doing in the 
future 
a his picture will be in every post office in town thats the 
way it works he is a fugitive drug dealer and we want to see him 
brought to justice and if that helps if there is some incentive 
for some panamanian to turn him in thats a very a million bucks 
that i would be very happy to sign the check for 
yes 
q yeah i was going to ask you about panama and the panamanians 
who have suffered mightily as a result of all of this not only 
because of the sanctions that we have imposed for a long time but 
the military action the homes destroyed the lives lost and so 
forth are you willing to make now a major commitment in terms of 
aid to panama to help rebuild what has been destroyed down there 
a yes i am willing to help the panamanian people we have 
already ordered the lifting of sanctions we are i am convinced 
that as we open up economic channels theyll do a much better the 
standard of living will increase for all as we go forward with 
investment we have permitted now the reflagging or the stop 
put it this way dont have to unflag their panamanian vessels 
and there are other things that we can do weve released escrowed 
funds we are trying to help mr endara already with you know 
operating funds to pay the workers and the people and beyond that 
though i think your question goes i think we will feel obligated 
to try to help in every way possible 
yeah

a path of lanterns flickered against 
a granite memorial thursday as grieving relatives and local 
residents marked the first anniversary of the pan am flight 103 
bombing over this scottish town 
the 270 lights one for each victim killed shone in the night 
after local clergymen dedicated the memorial in a 19th century 
graveyard during a day of somber and poignant commemoration 
at least 20 american relatives joined in the services 
culminating in an openair ecumenical gathering at night outside 
the town hall that on dec 21 1988 became a makeshift morgue 
more than onethird of lockerbie 3500 people turned out in 
freezing temperatures to hear the local roman catholic priest 
declare from this disaster there is no complete recovery 
the honest answer is that quite simply life cannot be the 
same again said the rev patrick keegan it has changed we 
have changed 
in the early evening relatives some sobbing packed an 
isolated stone church tundergarth overlooking the field where the 
cockpit fell from the jumbo jet it was blown apart by terrorist 
bomb in a radio cassette player 
earlier about 500 people gathered in biting cold at a simple 
dedication of the memorial in the dryfesdale cemetery one mile 
outside lockerbie 
while this might be a traumatic experience for us the worst 
has already happened said george williams of joppa md his only 
child a 24yearold us army lieutenant was on the flight 
when we go home well feel a whole lot better added 
williams 58 who came with his wife judy 
vapor trailing from two aircraft overhead formed a cross in what 
appeared to be a coincidental tribute 
all 259 people aboard the new yorkbound pan am jet died and 11 
others died on the ground as the jet exploded over this small town 
in southern scotland 
after a year of painstaking investigation the bomber has not 
been identified but suspicion points to an extremist middle east 
terrorist group the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command 
as darkness fell an american couple paul and eleanor hudson 
lighted 270 lanterns along a path leading to the memorial and in a 
circle before it their 16yearold daughter melina was aboard 
the flight 
classmates at melinas school the albany academy for girls in 
albany ny made the lanterns which were sandfilled bags with 
candles inside each was inscribed with a dove and the name of a 
victim 
its the greatest honor i can think of said mrs hudson 
from albany 
on the light polished granite of the 6foot memorial names of 
the victims are carved in roughly alphabetical order with families 
grouped together in three panels 
when you actually see the names thats when it really hits 
you 270 is just a number said briton barry flick whose 
brother clayton boarded flight 103 clayton flick and his fiancee 
had been going on a threeday sightseeing trip 
wreaths heaped at the foot of the memorial included one from 
syracuse university to its 35 students who perished on flight 103 
as they flew home for christmas from an exchange program 
i thought it was very appropriate and very respectful an 
extension of the people of lockerbie theyve given us faith and 
hope throughout the year said joe horgan of philadelphia a 
member of the board of victims of pan am flight 103 it represents 
american victims 
british families of victims sent a 3foot wreath of evergreen 
sprigs and carnations carrying the inscription their spirit 
lives on 
the stars and stripes sodden from rain that stopped only as the 
service in the cemetery began drooped in front of the granite 
memorial 
no formal invitations were issued to what the local member of 
parliament sir hector monro called a family affair but the 
us ambassador henry catto attended and queen elizabeth ii sent 
a representative 
in the heart of the garden is a grave containing a single casket 
symbolizing the 17 victims whose bodies were never found 10 from 
the aircraft and seven from lockerbie 
at the back of the cemetery a memorial plaque presented 
wednesday night by american relatives was attached to a rock wall 
where other relatives can affix individual plaques 
earlier britain announced that following recommendations of a 
security study inspectors with inert explosives will begin posing 
as terrorists to test airport security following the practice of 
israels el al airline

q yes mr president what can you tell us about civilian 
casualties specifically panamanian civilian casualties down there 
and was there any estimate given in the preplanning of this 
invasion of civilian casualties 
a our numbers are almost nonexistent and i heard some reports 
from a hospital and weve not been able to confirm those numbers 
that some civilians were killed and i just asked that of our 
defense chief who had the latest information when he came over 
here and so i just cant help you on the total numbers 
q well then my the other question was the second part 
was there an estimate in the preplanning of this invasion 
ai dont think an estimate of numbers but a great concern 
about that and one of the reasons we went in with the force we 
did to take down the pdf and do it as quickly was to minimize 
civilian casualties and the way we went after some of these 
targets was to minimize civilian casualties we a lot of kids 
risked their lives going in at night parachuting in someplace at 
night is not a piece of cake and we some of that was to stay 
away from the fact that civilians would be out and about in the 
morning 
q mr president how do you rate the chances now that 
laughter in response to offmike comment noriega might be able 
to manage some kind of a hitandrun guerrilla operation from 
hiding what are the chances of that 
a i dont think so the military doesnt seem to think that he 
has the communications or a pdfcontinued loyalty that would make 
him go into the woods i like the way colin powell put it he 
hasnt been in a jungle in a long time and its tough living and 
hes been living high off the hog off the panamanian people and 
so we dont expect kind of a sierra madre approach to this 
sarah youve been very good and kind all year this is my last 
press conference here 
q got a final question 
a and this is the secondtolast question i hope its a 
gentle one 
q what do you mean your last press conference here sir 
a is that your question well here is laughter heres 
the thing weve how many have we had this year 
q no but sir 
staff thirty 
a weve had 30 press conferences this year helen and some in 
your midst here have come to me and said please sarah lighten 
up do not dont do this quite so much 
thank you very much 
q this is a very mild question are you sending a letter today 
to the senate to coordinate with the war powers act they have the 
a i dont know whether it goes today but we will do what 
well were we will i think theres certain technical language 
on this that but notification of the congress will be done in 
accordance with our policy 
this is the last one 
q have the soviets the soviets have criticized very sharply 
this distinction of yours to the point of saying theyre going 
forward and the united states is going backwards what is your 
reaction to this 
a my reaction is i need to get on a wire there in a telegram 
or something explain this to mr gorbachev its not altogether 
surprising that he doesnt understand some of the special 
arrangements that the united states has in panama its not 
surprising that he doesnt fully understand that this freely 
elected man had been deprived of the democracy and i also need to 
let him know ok if american marine is killed if they kill an 
american marine thats real bad and if they threaten and 
brutalize the wife of an american citizen sexually threatening the 
lieutenants wife while kicking him in the groin over and over 
again then mr gorbachev please understand this president is 
going to do something about it 
so well have to explain it very the last one maureen and 
then i really do have to go

q will you bring any troops home by christmas 
q mr president we now find out that last summer when we 
thought that your policy was no contact with the chinese 
government that you sent a highlevel delegation there to talk to 
them dont you feel that american people deserve to know that when 
you say something nots happening that its really not happening 
a yes i do think they do but i didnt say that i said no 
highlevel exchanges so please look at it carefully 
q but you didnt tell us that this was happening 
a well but no i feel no obligation to do that i feel an 
obligation to keep you informed but i have an obligation as 
president to conduct the foreign policy of this country the way i 
see fit reporting under the law to the united states congress you 
could say how come you didnt tell me that you were going down 
to invade the send in those troops down into panama because i 
didnt want to take a chance the information would get out that is 
the responsibility of a president and i will continue to exercise 
it while having 37 press conferences next year 
shes got a followup 
q does that mean all kinds of other secret diplomatic missions 
going on around that we have no idea 
a maybe not of that magnitude but theres a lot going on 
theres a lot of going on that in the conduct of the foreign 
policy or a debate within the us government has to be sorted out 
without the spotlight of the news there has to be that way the 
whole opening to china would never have happened the whole the 
whole yes if kissinger hadnt undertaken that mission it would 
have fallen apart so you have to use your own judgment 
and youve got your job and that is to find out absolutely 
everything you can careful im sure most of you are about 
legitimate national security concerns but i have mine and that is 
to conduct the foreign policy of this country the way i think best 
if the american people dont like it i expect theyll get somebody 
else to take my job but im going to keep doing it and weve had 
a very open administration very 
but once in a while if i go to try to set up a meeting with mr 
gorbachev weve got people here who scream who say you should 
have told us that the day you wrote the letter to him i dont 
agree with that and i was elected so im going to keep on trying 
to do this with an openness i hope a new openness but also 
the right of a president to conduct his business in this case of 
panama to safeguard the lives of american kids 
and the other one to go and see what happens i know how china 
works see what we can do make a representation of how strongly 
we feel against human rights abuse but see what its going to take 
to go forward 
thank you all

israel television said thursday that gen 
manuel antonio noriega a fugitive from us justice since american 
forces invaded panama this week was spotted within the last 24 
hours on the luxurious island of contadora 
israel television correspondent hanan azran told the associated 
press that noriega and mike harrari a former agent in israels 
mossad intelligence agency and a top noriega aide were on 
contadora 40 miles southeast of panama city planning an escape to 
nicaragua where they would ask for asylum 
azran said the television report was based on two phone calls he 
received from people who are close to mike and the weapons 
business there he said similar phone calls were also made to the 
panamanian embassy in tel aviv 
azran said the callers who he would only further identify as 
native spanish speakers said noriega and harrari were spotted with 
their aides on contadora within the last 24 hours 
they explained to me that harraris plan is to cross the 
border into costa rica and then nicaragua azran said 
contadora first came to public attention when the shah of iran 
stayed several months there after he was exiled from his country 
contadora was where the foreign ministers of four latin 
countries mexico venezuela colombia and panama met in 1981 to 
negotiate the first attempts at peace in central america the four 
later expanded to a group of eight including south american 
countries but panama was later suspended from the group 
azran said harrari and noriega plan to go from contadora to 
chiriqui a small town in the north of the country which noreiga 
has already prepared for himself with his own people 
azran said he was told the two men would then cross with their 
forces into costa rica and later nicaragua 
harrari a renegade mossad agent is regarded as a top noriega 
advisor 
israels foreign ministry refused to comment on harraris 
actions saying the ministry does not comment on the actions of 
private citizens 
there was no immediate comment on the israeli television report 
from us or panamanian officials

parliament on thursday voted to 
dissolve itself on march 16 paving the way for the first free 
elections in the country in more than four decades 
before it dissolves however parliament will begin discussing a 
motion at its january session calling for the complete withdrawal 
of all soviet troops from hungary defense minister ferenc karpati 
announced plans for the continued withdrawal as part of moscows 
unilateral troop pullout from eastern europe 
dispensing with the usual showofhands voting 320 deputies 
decided by roll call vote to end parliaments mandate march 16 
there were two abstentions and no votes against 
the house also adopted the governments budget for 1990 which 
foresees strict austerity measures agreed with the international 
monetary fund 
negotiations with the imf for hardcurrency loans necessary to 
help hungary service its 20 billion foreign debt and revamp its 
economy hinged on the adoption of the budget 
no date was set for the elections the first free balloting 
since the communists took power in 1948 acting president matyas 
sueros was to announce a date by friday 
elections were due in june but there have been increasing calls 
for them to be moved up 
hungary is one of at least four east european nations expecting 
their first free elections since the communists took power more 
than 40 years ago in the first half of 1990 
in east germany elections are scheduled for may 6 in bulgaria 
and czechoslovakia plans have also been announced for free 
elections before the end of june 
the budget adopted by parliament after considerable debate is 
to lead to price rises as subsidies on consumer goods prices are 
reduced and could contribute to unemployment as lossmaking firms 
are closed down 
the imf wants to see the countrys budget deficit which is 
likely to reach 800 million this year cut to 156 million in 1990 
as a precondition to further loans 
a crucial 1 billion world bank loan hinges on the imf agreement 
as does a 114 billion loan from the european community 
hungary is to resume its negotiations with the imf in january 
in presenting the budget wednesday finance minister laszlo 
bekesi said there would be a drastic reduction of subsidies to loss 
making companies by 720 million which in turn could double or 
even quadruple the number of unemployed currently at 25000 
subsidies on consumer and producer prices are also to be reduced 
which will lead to price increases averaging 25 percent on foods 
starting in january 
bekesi said the budget was designed to avoid economic 
collapse and he called it a crisis budget 
the house wednesday adopted a new bill on housing that will lead 
to an increase of average rents by 35 percent starting feb 1 it 
also levied a home loan tax 
bekesi said interest payments on the countrys 20 billion 
foreign debt will amount to 15 billion in 1990 and payment on the 
principle would be another 19 billion 
as part of the countrys ongoing economic reform designed to 
introduce market forces into the economy the governments economic 
program foresees initiating bankruptcy proceedings against

relatives and friends of americans killed when pan am flight 103 
blew up a year ago over lockerbie scotland honored the 270 
victims on thursday bells pealed on the anniversary of the tragedy 
pan am took out fullpage ads in newspapers here and abroad 
urging the public to pray for these and all other victims of 
terrorism all over the world at 202 pm est the exact time 
that the plane exploded 
in addition to holding memorials at kennedy heathrow and 
frankfort airports pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon said all of 
our employees did pause at 202 at their workplaces around the 
world observing a moment of silence 
pan am offered to fly families of victims to memorial services 
in lockerbie about two dozen attended 
those marching past pan am headquarters in new york city were 
mostly silent in the 20degree temperatures although some carried 
signs with messages such as 270 people murdered over scotland 
and we are all victims of pan am flight 103 many wore 
photographs of loved ones pinned to their coats it was an exercise 
some relatives go through each month in front of pan am to 
publicize what they say was lax security that allowed the bomb to 
be planted on the plane 
the protest was followed by a memorial service at st georges 
episcopal church attended by about 300 people the name of each 
victim was read aloud and 270 white carnations were placed on a 
large christmas wreath 
mary allen desantis an aunt of 25yearold victim julian 
benello said the memorial activities consist of a lot of tears 
a lot of anger and a lot of unanswered questions 
jeannine boulanger of shrewsbury mass whose 21yearold 
daughter died in the crash said she was angered over pan ams ad 
asking for a moment of silence for the victims 
thats the reason were here because there was too much 
silence she said 
about 200 people lighted candles and placed remembrance roses at 
a service at holy trinity church in washington dc dignitaries on 
hand included sir antony acland britians ambassador to the united 
states who read a passage from the new testament 
terrorism is on the rise and has become a plague of our world 
today bert ammerman of river vale nj whose brother tom was 
killed told the gathering 
ammerman president of a support group of flight 103 victims 
relatives also sent an open letter to president bush urging 
steppedup efforts to punish those responsible for the bombing 
obviously nothing you can do will bring back our loved 
ones he told bush in the letter but without appropriate 
retaliatory action terrorist groups and the outlaw nations of the 
world will quite understandably assume that american citizens are 
easy prey any time they want to make their point on the world 
stage 
many memorials like ones in greensburg pa and ramsey nj 
consisted of chiming bells at 202 pm est 
bells also pealed one year to the minute at syracuse university 
which lost 35 students although most students had already departed 
for christmas break 550 people attended a campus memorial last 
week 
many of those who lost friends and relatives preferred to mourn 
in seclusion 
in massachusetts emily pescatore said she could not make it 
overseas to commemorate the anniversary of her sons death so she 
arranged for a service thursday night in a dedham church that was 
to include a candlelighting ceremony and a bagpipe processional 
other families of victims were expected to attend 19 new 
englanders were killed in the explosion 
john boland of nashua nh who lost his son stephen 21 said 
he wants publicity about the event to fade because every reminder 
is painful 
we have a good two or three weeks and then were sitting at 
supper watching the 7 oclock news and see a plane coming down 
he said i dont want to watch it ive seen that plane come down 
enough

president bush vigorously defended sending 
unannounced highlevel missions to beijing saying thursday that if 
americans didnt approve i expect theyd get somebody else to 
take my job 
bush compared his sending envoys to china in july and in august 
despite the governments bloody tiananmen square crackdown against 
protesters in june to thenpresident nixons decision to dispatch 
aide henry kissinger to china in 1972 
the whole opening to china would never have happened if 
kissinger hadnt undertaken that mission it would have fallen 
apart so you have to use your own judgment bush told a news 
conference 
he denied that sending his national security adviser brent 
scowcroft and a senior state department official to beijing on the 
two trips represented a violation of sanctions he imposed on china 
bush ordered a halt to high level exchanges which he 
insisted thursday did not apply to governmenttogovernment 
contacts between officials 
the administration claims that scowcrofts visits were 
contacts rather than exchanges 
bush said he felt no obligation to announce the missions 
i feel an obligation to keep you informed but i have an 
obligation as president to conduct the foreign policy of this 
country the way i see fit reporting under the law to the united 
states congress 
asked if similar clandesdine missions were now under way bush 
said maybe not of that magnitude but theres a lot of going on 
in the conduct of the foreign policy that has to be sorted out 
without the spotlight of the news 
youve got your job and that is to find out absolutely 
everything you can bush told reporters but i have mine and 
that is to conduct the foreign policy of this country the way i 
think best if the american people dont like it i suspect 
theyd get somebody else to take my job 
bush also noted that he had been criticized from some quarters 
for not announcing sooner his mediterranean meeting with soviet 
president mikhail s earlier this month 
i dont agree with that and i was elected bush insisted

a panel of mental health experts cast doubt 
thursday on the fbi conclusion that clayton hartwig triggered an 
explosion on the uss iowa because he wanted to commit suicide 
and kill his shipmates 
i do not believe that clayton hartwig was suicidal and i 
certainly do not believe he was suicidialhomicidal dr douglas 
jacobs told the house armed service committee 
the fbi however said it stood behind its findings 
jacobs a professor of psychiatry at the harvard university 
medical school and director of the suicide education institute of 
boston was on a 14member panel of mental health experts that 
examined the fbi findings after the april 19 blast that killed 
hartwig and 46 crewmembers 
the panel consisted of 12 psychologists appointed on a pro bono 
basis by the american psychological association at the request of 
the armed services committee and two psychiatrists named by the 
committee seven of the 14 panel members appeared at thursdays 
hearing 
members of the house committee which is investigating the 
navys conclusion that hartwig most likely caused the explosion in 
the battleships no 2 gun turret attacked the methods the fbi 
used to reach its conclusion 
lawmakers criticized the fact that no independent interviews 
were conducted and that analysts relied entirely on interview 
summaries and other material supplied by the navy investigative 
service 
hartwigs parents and a sister attended thursdays hearing 
when asked why no review had been made of such primary documents 
as hartwigs personnel and medical records robert hazelwood of the 
fbis national violent crime center replied we were satisfied 
with the information we received 
i find it mindboggling that you are asserting 
criminalhomicidal conduct and do not go to the primary 
documents said rep frank mccloskey dind i think it is 
almost fatally flawed 
we are very comfortable in our honest assertion hazelwood 
responded 
eight of the psychologists and both psychiatrists took serious 
exception to both the fbis methods and the conclusions drawn 
it is my conclusion that the data is qualitatively and 
quantitatively weak and does not warrant the conclusion that was 
drawn said dr ronald s ebert senior forensic psychologist at 
mclean hospital in belmont mass 
i got the impression that there was a determination that had 
been made and then data had to be gathered by navy investigators 
to support that determination ebert said 
norman g poythress professor of psychology at the university 
of alabama said that while suicide could not be ruled out 
arbitrarily i dont think the conclusion is nearly as strong as 
has been characterized 
he noted that hartwig had told a friend in an april letter that 
his service aboard the iowa was soon to end that he had strong 
attachments to the ship and its crew and that he wanted to stay in 
port to wave the iowa goodbye when it sailed in june 
this is not a man in my judgment who had willing disregard for 
his shipmates poythress said 
however alan berman professor of psychology at american 
university said he was comfortable with the conclusion that 
hartwig committed suicide 
unfortunately i am uncomfortable with the procedure that led 
to the data berman said 
robert p archer professor of psychiatry at the eastern 
virginia medical school at norfolk outlined the reasons for the 
inadequacy of the data the fbi reviewed 
there was no information on hartwigs early development family 
environment or family history including suicide legal history 
medical and psychological records and alcohol or drug abuse he 
said 
it is my opinion that the evidence is not sufficient to say 
the explosion was the result of a homicidal or suicidal act by 
hartwig archer said

the official tass news agency dispatched dramatic 
and detailed reports from romanias capital early friday making 
little attempt to hide the swelling public feelings against 
president nicolae ceausescu 
absent from the tass reports were any details of ceausescus 
speech at an official rally in bucharest where he was shouted down 
in years past tass would have emphasized ceausescus views 
instead it reported the growing protests against him and clashes 
between demonstrators and police 
the coverage highlighted the kremlins changing attitude toward 
the conservative communist stalwart which has resulted in frosty 
meetings between ceausescu and reformminded soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
gorbachev repeatedly has expressed support for the reformers who 
have taken power this year in other eastern european countries 
the soviet president withheld comment on the events in romania 
where hundreds perhaps thousands have been reported killed in 
recent days he told the soviet parliament that members from the 
republic of moldavia had called for adoption of a statement on the 
turmoil in the country on their eastern border 
but gorbachev said the soviet union had not received enough 
information about the events to warrant comment even though the 
foreign ministry summoned the romanian ambassador in moscow and 
asked its envoy in bucharest to supply details 
the romanian ambassador here does not provide an opportunity 
to form a notion of what is taking place in that country 
gorbachev told the 2250 deputies 
tass meanwhile spoke of swelling numbers of demonstrators 
shouting anticeausescu slogans it said the government responded 
with tanks patrolling the streets and there is yet no official 
response to the events in bucharest 
tass also reported that at least two people were killed after 
they were run over by an armored personnel carrier and that 
demonstrators were fired on 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev at a moscow 
briefing declined comment 
if we do receive information on victims among people we of 
course will be extremely sorry for them he said 
but he added we should emphasize that we do have opinions on 
what is happening but in my place as an official representative of 
the ministry of foreign affairs i cannot go into comments without 
having allinclusive information and orders in that regard 
the kremlins attitude toward the romanian leader became 
apparent dec 4 after ceausescu met gorbachev in moscow 
an official report said the two met in comradely fashion in 
the spirit of an open exchange of opinions in diplomatic jargon 
that means they disagreed sharply 
in the soviet republic of moldavia which borders romania and 
has a large populace that speak a romanian dialect activists said 
they planned an outdoor religious service friday for victims of the 
bloodshed in romania 
moldavians are ethnically very close to romanians but the 
border between their republic and romania has been tightly guarded 
since ceausescu refused in 1968 to take part in the warsaw pact 
invasion of czechoslovakia 
natalya pascal a spokeswoman for the moldavian peoples front 
said ethnic moldavians had not been able to gather any detailed 
information on the events across the border

a federal judge thursday delayed the start of 
john poindexters irancontra trial and demanded to see excerpts 
from former president reagans diaries and notes which poindexter 
wants to use in court 
us district court judge harold greene said president reagan 
shall produce for the courts inspection by jan 7 some of 
the materials sought by poindexter greene will then determine 
whether the material is relevant to the criminal charges against 
reagans former national security adviser 
greene moved back the jan 22 starting date of poindexters 
trial until feb 20 saying a delay is necessary because of pending 
issues those include poindexters subpoenas approved by the 
court seeking reagans documents 
greene quashed major portions of poindexters subpoenas for 
documents from the former president but kept in place the most 
sensitive sections those dealing with reagans diaries notes and 
notebooks 
the court is not disposed to requiring president reagan to 
make wholesale production of documents which ultimately may turn 
out to contain little or no material evidence said the judge 
the obvious answer to this dilemma is an examination 
by the court of the relevant excerpts from the former presidents 
diaries notes and notebooks to determine whether they contain 
specific evidence that should be produced said greene 
greene said legal and historical precedents indicate that a 
review by the judge is appropriate of the presidential papers at 
issue 
the judge said that he will review the reagn documents and 
render a decision on the parts of the reagan diary notes and 
notebooks that must be made available to poindexter 
poindexter obtained court approval to issue the subpoena for 
reagans documents by submitting a secret paper outlining what he 
believes they contain 
the judge said that reagan and president bush will be permitted 
to see that paper next month if reagan invokes executive privilege 
in response to any decision by greene to turn reagan documents over 
poindexter 
executive privilege is the legal concept by which presidents can 
shield from public disclosure documents used in carrying out their 
constitutional duties in the watergate cases involving president 
nixon courts ruled that the privilege could not be used to protect 
evidence needed in a criminal trial 
poindexter separately sought approval to subpoenaed reagan 
earlier this week seeking testimony from the former president in 
person 
greene set up a schedule for reagans lawyers and president bush 
to file objections to that testimonial subpoena and for 
poindexters lawyers to respond to the objections greene said he 
will rule on the matter sometime after jan 8 
the judge in october outlined poindexters statement of what he 
expected to discover filed in support of a request to issue a 
subpoena to reagan for documents 
reagan met poindexter daily frequently alone and they 
discussed specific matters which now are connected to the criminal 
charges against poindexter the former national security adviser 
says 
the subjects discussed with reagan include the accuracy of a 
chronology prepared by former white house aide oliver north and 
reviewed by poindexter according to greenes outline 
the chronology falsely says no one in the us government knew 
until 1986 that a ciaassisted november 1985 shipment to iran 
contained hawk missiles 
four of the five criminal charges against poindexter relate to 
allegedly lying about the 1985 shipment 
reagan also discussed the administrations view of a house 
resolution inquiring into whether north was raising money and 
supplying military advice to the contras 
poindexter is accused of obstructing congress by sending letters 
endorsing earlier white house denials that north was assisting the 
contras 
poindexter had subpoenaed documents from reagan touching on 67 
meetings or events involving the former president and his national 
security adviser fifty of the meetings or events involved the 
contras and 17 involved the administrations secret arms sales to 
iran according to papers filed in the case 
poindexter also served a subpoena on the archivist of the united 
states who holds presidential documents greene quashed that 
subpoena after the archivist asserted that he already had turned 
over to the prosecutors the documents poindexter was seeking

president mikhail s gorbachev blasted lithuanias 
communists on thursday for breaking with the national communist 
party in their drive to restore their republics sovereignty 
the national communist party central committee scheduled an 
emergency meeting to discuss the historic defiance 
rimantas kanapenes a spokesman for lithuanias political group 
sajudis said gorbachev summoned lithuanian members of the national 
parliament to protest wednesdays decision by the lithuanian 
communist party congress to end subordination to the national party 
and declare itself independent with its own rules and program 
the kremlin had warned of great trouble ahead for the 
lithuanians and it came fast 
this decision should be assessed only as a step aimed at the 
split of the lithuanian communist party from the soviet communist 
party the ruling politburo said in a message to the lithuanian 
communists 
this concerns not only the lithuanian communist party but the 
entire party 
the message was signed by gorbachev and reported by the official 
news agency tass 
gorbachev told the congress he shared the concern and alarm 
of many communists about lithuanias action and said the politburo 
decided to call an emergency meeting of the central committee its 
parent body on the issue in a few days 
he said dozens of communist members wrote him notes calling 
lithuanias action very sad for all communists and describing 
it as a new step in a separatist tendency in the country a new 
enormous danger for the soviet communist party and our 
multinational state 
the alarm is growing the chain reaction has started the 
notes read 
a sajudis official has predicted the communist parties of 
neighboring latvia and estonia in the baltics and armenia and 
georgia in the caucasus would follow lithuanias lead and break 
off from the national party 
kanapenes said gorbachev telephoned lithuanian party chief 
algirdas brazauskas in vilnius the republics capital shortly 
after the 855160 vote to break away from the national party 
brazauskas said it was a very difficult conversation 
kanapenes said gorbachev said he was very sorry about the 
decision 
brazauskas told a news conference in vilnius thursday night he 
had a very correct talk with gorbachev and denied rumors that 
gorbachev threatened to declare martial law in lithuania 
its a great anecdote but there was no such talk he said 
he said he understood why some orthodox communists were upset 
i think its a very important step toward perestroika but for 
someone who cant imagine such profound restructuring it must be a 
real shock 
the lithuanian congress reinforced its stand thursday by 
approving statutes implementing the break with the national party 
and reelecting the 57yearold brazauskas as its first secretary 
kanapenes said gorbachev aides also called in the head of 
sajudis vytautas landsbergis 
a resolution approved by lithuanias legislature declares the 
republics party an equal partner with the soviet communist 
party other progressive parties public organizations and 
movements 
that position runs counter to more than 80 years of party 
policy before the 1917 bolshevik revolution vladimir i lenin 
demanded unity and a 1921 party congress formally ruled out any 
factions 
tass said about 160 lithuanian congress delegates who voted 
against the breakoff met in vilnius on thursday it said the 
dissident group claiming to represent a quarter of the republics 
communists pledged to work to maintain ties with the national 
party 
politburo member yegor k ligachev had said wednesday that 
lithuanias move is great trouble for the people and for 
communists 
lithuanians just do not realize yet what grief will descend 
lithuanian leaders on dec 7 supported a move by the legislature 
to create a multiparty political system striking from the baltic 
republics constitution language making the communist party the 
leading force in society 
the communists new program also supports eventual restoration 
of the independence lithuania enjoyed between the world wars the 
soviet union absorbed the region in 1940 under secret agreements 
with nazi germany 
several small political parties already have formed to challenge 
the communists in feb 24 local elections and lithuanian communist 
leaders say they need an independent structure to compete in the 
balloting

shipowners of many countries that fly the flag 
of panama so they can pay lower wages and taxes wont have to 
reflag their vessels president bush said thursday 
with the installation of president guillermo endara the us is 
lifting sanctions imposed against the government of gen manuel 
antonio noriega bush said the action is a measure of support for 
the new usbacked government 
one of those sanctions announced nov 30 and scheduled to go 
into effect jan 31 would have barred ships flying the panamanian 
flag from entering american ports us officials had said the 
action would deny noriega and his government tens of millions of 
dollars of revenue 
noriegas cronies will also be deprived of millions of dollars 
of illegal income in the form of bribes and kickbacks the white 
house said in a nov 30 statement announcing the sanction 
owners of ships registered in panama pay a fee based on tonnage 
but they dont pay any tax on earnings as they might have to do if 
they registered the ships with their own government 
the flags of liberia cyprus and the bahamas are also called 
flags of convenience 
the state department estimated that 1500 ships of more than 
1000 tons would have been affected by the ban 
philip j loree chairman of the federation of american 
controlled shipping said that as many as 10000 ships may fly the 
panama flag but that many of them are small and never come into 
us ports 
loree said that registration of about 400 ships mostly 
japanese had been changed in anticipation of the ban at an 
estimated cost of 16 million

defense secretary dick cheney said thursday 
that us troops were still involved in conflict and firefights 
in panama city well into the second day of the us intervention 
however he said the operation had been enormously 
successful during its first 36 hours despite the fact that gen 
manuel antonio noriega had escaped capture 
cheney said taking noriega had been only one of several 
objectives in the intervention 
the defense secretary pledged to get us forces in panama home 
as quickly as we can but he also said the date remains open as 
long as is at large and civil unrest continues 
its still a situation in which there is ongoing conflict and 
firefights said cheney said acknowledging the possibility of 
individual terrorist strikes and the taking of us hostages 
clearly we havent resolved all the potential situations 
where there may be americans being held cheney said in an 
interview with 11 newspaper and wire service reporters we are 
aggressively working every one of those cases 
major resistance had ended he said and we dont have any 
reason at this point to anticipate any sort of organized attacks 
pressed to predict when the american invasion force could be 
brought home cheney said that remains an open question 
president bush meanwhile said us troops would pursue noriega 
as long as it takes and he called the nations commitment to 
the operation in panama openended 
gen colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
sat at cheneys side during the briefing and both men refused to 
speculate where noriega might be hiding both men appeared somewhat 
tired after their hourslong vigils at the pentagon 
powell said that while there still appears to be resistance by 
noriega loyalists in panama city for the most part it is 
disorganized resistance it will dry up over time the 
fourstar general said he did not believe that the resistance was 
under the direction of a central command 
us forces encountered sporadic firing in panama city while 
trying to recover american hostages capture noriega and restore 
democracy pentagon officials said 
those were the three main objectives of the nearly 24000 us 
troops who on wednesday dispersed the panamanian defense forces a 
key to restoring order was gaining control of the streets of panama 
city where looting was reported overnight 
us forces were in control of several key points in the city 
including the legislative building said pentagon spokesman pete 
williams raising the possibility that guillermo endara the new 
usbacked president would go there during the day 
lt gen tom kelly director of operations for the joint chiefs 
of staff also said us troops were protecting the panama canal 
against sabotage by noriega loyalists he rated the chances for 
successful attacks as low not impossible but low 
he said all panamian bases were in us hands although some 
shooting was reported in the city 
it appears there is some resistance that is organized and some 
that isnt kelly said noriega was not believed to be in command 
of any units that were resisting he said 
we do not think he is effectively in command of anything at 
this time said rear adm ted sheafer an intelligence specialist 
with the joint staff 
the latest us military casualty count stood at 21 killed in 
action 208 wounded and four missing the first american dead were 
flown back to dover air force base in delaware 
in addition candy helin 43 the wife us serviceman steve 
helin was dead mrs helin who taught gifted chiuldren at a us 
government school in panama and was the daughter of a former army 
port commander was killed by stray fire from the panamanian 
defense forces 
helin told his sister jane sheaffer of dixon ill that his 
wife was killed in an ambush as the couple drove home on a dark 
road early wednesday from dinner at a friends 
we dont think she was shot deliberately kelly said 
us officials put the casualty count for panamanian defense 
forces as 59 killed 66 wounded 
us forces captured 1500 panamanian soldiers but were unsure 
how many noriega loyalists remained at large snipers were spotted 
clad in the black uniforms of panamanian special forces sheafer 
said 
he reported sporadic fighting saying people on the tops of 
buildings are the kind of thing im talking about snipers were 
reported at the caracol hotel in the city 
us intelligence was tracking dozens of reported sightings of 
noriega the rate of which increased sharply after the americans 
offered a 1 million reward for him said williams 
the pentagon believes noriega still is in panama despite 
reports that he had fled to colombia the dominican republic or 
mexico said sheafer 
the lives of american hostages became a prime concern for us 
forces as the fighting died down williams said there were reports 
of an unknown number of americans being held in separate incidents 
us troops freed 29 americans and 35 foreign nationals mostly 
panamanians from the marriott hotel in panama city late wednesday 
night but williams said a list of the evacuees was not available 
overall 35000 us citizens live in panama and there are 
americans scattered throughout the city said williams

pentagon officials fear actions by noriega 
loyalists taking americans hostage perhaps or attacking the 
panama canal could force us troops to transform their 
mopup operation into a longterm guerrilla engagement 
the nations military leaders were looking at thursdays day 2 
of operation just cause as crucial in the battle for control of 
the central american nation said one highlevel military official 
the fear is that unless manuel antonio noriegas supporters are 
captured and disarmed they could continue to threaten panamanian 
citizens and the lives of the 35000 americans living in the 
country or at the very least offer a serious disruption to any 
return to normalcy at the canal and elsewhere officials said 
this is a key day because it will determine whether the 
panamanian defense forces and the dignity battalions are 
consolidating or whether they remain as pockets of resistance that 
can be cut out and neutralized said the highly placed officer 
who spoke on condition he not be identified by name 
asked how long he believed the strike force of thousands of us 
troops will remain in the country the official said i dont 
think anybody here knows 
remarking that the forces were going housetohouse in their 
efforts to clean out the remaining noriega loyalists in panama city 
and could be forced to search the countryside in search of the 
deposed general the official said its not just a mopup 
operation anymore 
asked if us military units might well be facing a protracted 
guerrilla battle in urban and country areas in their search for 
noriega the official answered yes it very well may be 
president bush asked at a session with reporters whether he 
believed the intervention would become a guerrilla operation said 
i dont think so adding that noriega has been stripped of his 
communications capabilities and the support of military forces that 
would allow him to mount an opposition in the countryside 
he hasnt been in a jungle in a long time and its tough 
living and hes been living high off the hog off the panamanian 
people and so we dont expect a kind of mountain guerrilla 
organization to arise reminiscent of that led by cubas fidel 
castro in the 1950s bush said 
defense secretary dick cheney in a separate session with 
reporters said that while major resistance from the panamanian 
military had ended he could not rule out any possibility of 
such things as terrorist attacks 
its still a situation in which there is ongoing conflict and 
firefights said cheney said acknowledging the possibility of 
individual terrorist strikes and the taking of us hostages 
clearly we havent resolved all the potential situations 
where there may be americans being held cheney said we are 
aggressively working every one of those cases he said in 
comments to a group of news service and newspaper reporters 
at a public briefing on thursday pentagon spokesman pete 
williams struck a positive note saying that the organized 
resistance has ceased at this point and that the objective 
of the day was to support the establishment of a democratic 
government under the newly sworn and ussupported president 
guillermo endara 
williams did acknowledge however that there was some 
conflict continuing with some members of the noriegas dignity 
battalions the his armed supporters in civil garb that remain 
in panama city 
at the briefing army gen tom kelly the joint staffs director 
of operations advised reporters that there was no time estimate 
available for when the increased us forces might withdraw 
we dont have a time line kelly said they will be there 
until the job is done 
rear adm ted sheafer who also briefed reporters said us 
military officials still think noriega is inside panamanian borders 
we believe he is in the country sheafer said 
on capitol hill sen robert kasten rwis expressed concern 
over a longterm engagement 
if there is a beginning middle and end to american military 
involvement it is far better than having this thing dragging out 
over weeks and months kasten said 
another senior pentagon official who also spoke privately said 
he was confident that the specialized us military units on 
noriegas trail will ultimately be successful 
it may take some time he said but theyll get him 
noriega is noisy blustery and has such a big ego that it is 
nearly impossible for him to travel incognito the official said 
the official said that the us intervention force will be able 
to sustain itself easily over the long term if a lengthy presence 
is necessary because of the wellorganized us base of operations 
that has been in place for decades in panama

patricio aylwin met on thursday with 
augusto pinochet whom he will replace as president in march and 
said the general refused to give up command of the army 
after the 50minute meeting the civilian presidentelect told 
reporters he asked pinochet to consider relinquishing the command 
which he cannot be forced to do under the constitution his military 
regime wrote in 1980 
i thought it my duty to let him know i considered it 
preferable that he not make use of the special constitutional 
provisions aylwin said he told me the opposite 
the issue was left pending for another conversation aylwin 
said when asked whether he thought pinochet would change his mind 
the presidentelect said youll have to ask him 
aylwin a 71yearold moderate christian democrat supported by a 
17party coalition won a landslide victory in elections dec 14 
and will take office march 11th with a new civiilian congress 
he said several other issues were discussed in thursdays 
meeting at the presidential palace including a bill prepared by 
the ruling junta that would give the military virtual autonomy 
under civilian rule 
pinochet 74 made no immediate comment but interior minister 
carlos caceres who was present at the meeting gave an account 
similar to aylwins 
the general seized power in september 1973 overthrowing 
president salvador allende an elected marxist who died in the 
coup he was forced to call elections when voters rejected a 
referendum proposal last year that his presidency be extended to 
1997 
according to aylwin pinochet said his remaining as commander 
was the best guarantee of the armys loyalty to the constitution 
and the future government 
thursdays meeting was the first known direct conversation since 
the coup between pinochet and any leading critic of his 
authoritarian rule 
about 2000 aylwin supporters waited outside the palace for his 
arrival and chanted give it to him hard as the 
presidentelect entered the building 
when some government officials peered through trough gtrgout of 
windowsped out palace windows the crowd waved and shouted go 
away pinochet and the dictatorship will fall 
aylwin said he and pinochet they discussed a proposed armed 
forces law that would bar the new government from cutting the 
defense budget limit its influence in promotion of officers and 
allow the military to decide on arms purchases without government 
approval 
the fourman military junta that acts as a legislature under 
pinochet has yet to approve the legislation 
pinochet invited him to prepare written comments on the armed 
forces law and other issues then our people and people from the 
government would debate their differences and look for reasonable 
solutions aylwin said

reestablishing law and order in 
panama is the next objective of the us military but the capture 
of gen manuel antonio noreiga remains a priority a top military 
planner said thursday 
as long as noriega is floating around there are going to be 
some people who will not accept the government of president 
guillermo endara said lt col bill bennett 
we want to capture this guy and get him to miami bennett 
said there are ongoing efforts to locate general im sorry 
mr noriega 
bennett chief of contingency plans for the us southern 
command in panama said he could not estimate the strength of 
remaining forces loyal to noriega but that they remain mostly in 
outlying towns where us troops have yet to go 
weve got to reestablish law and order throughout panama 
city bennett said 
the plan he said is to identify leaders who will be loyal to 
the endara government and then get a panamanian police force in 
action 
we are interested in doing what the endara government will 
need to succeed bennett told reporters 
there are about 1500 us military police already in panama 
with another 1500 en route to help with law and order bennett 
said 
bennett predicted that more panamanian military units that 
have been sitting on the fence will soon support the endara 
government 
but that is where the capture of noriega does become 
important he said we dont want to give them any sort of 
cause to rally to the other side

president guillermo endara on thursday made 
his first appearance in public since being sworn in and announced 
an 18hourlong curfew would go into effect immediately in the face 
of widespread looting 
the order had little initial impact and it was unclear how it 
would be enforced panama city was a scene of chaos with thousands 
looting stores amid scattered gunfire no police were seen on the 
street 
endara said in a speech at the national assembly building that 
he will preside over a government of reconstruction and 
reconciliation he asked panamanian exiles to return because the 
military dictatorship has fallen 
one of first problems that we have to face is the problem of 
anarchy and public order that now exists because of this i have 
ordered the closing for two days today and tomorrow of all 
private and public establishments endara said 
with all these measures and other police measures that we will 
take we hope to reestablish public order before christmas 
although he mentioned two days of closing the curfew he 
proclaimed began at 2 pm thursday and was to expire at 6 am 
friday he did not say whether it would be extended 
endara was sworn in as president early wednesday morning by a 
panamanian judge in a private ceremony shortly after us troops 
attacked panamanian defense forces the americans failed in their 
effort to seize gen manuel antonio noriega who last may annulled 
a presidential election won by endara 
endara said he talked to president bush by phone and asked him 
for immediate emergency help in food and medicine for those who 
are injured hungry and sick he said he was told aid was coming 
endaras speech was transmitted over the uscontrolled 
patriotic network for broadcasting the truth the only radio 
station on the air the speech at the national assembly was 
attended by about 200 people most of them members of political 
parties who opposed noriega 
us military officials confirmed that endara had stayed on a 
us military base from the time he was sworn in to the assembly 
address 
endara appointed first vice president ricardo arias calderon as 
minister of government and justice responsible for internal 
security he named second vice president guillermo ford as minister 
of planning and political economy 
arias and ford had been sworn in along with endara 
endara also announced the appointments of eduardo vallarino as 
ambassador to the united nations lauren fabrega as ambassador to 
the organization of american states and carlos rodriguez as us 
ambassador 
no other appointments were announced and it was not clear when 
he would get around to structuring a government 
arias said he was contacting police officials asking them to 
return to their jobs he said he had started contacting some 
military to offer them an opportunity to define their loyalty to 
the people so they can resume their service to fatherland 
the police force is part of the defense forces which were in 
large measure either resisting the us occupation or were 
dispersed by the fighting it was not clear who would enforce 
endaras order or any kind of law and order here 
also unclear was how much support endara had among panamanians 
or the extent of his grip on the government 
but he emphasized the importance of restoring order to panama 
francisco rodriguez who was appointed noriegas provisional 
president after election results were annulled told reporters 
wednesday we are prepared to resist 
rodriguez was apparently in hiding thursday 
in elections held may 7 endara beat noriegas handpicked 
presidential candidate by a 31 margin according to international 
observers noriega nullified the results ignoring the outcry at 
home and abroad 
endara is a member of the liberal authentic party and ran for 
president as the compromise candidate of an eightparty 
antinoriega alliance

american combat soldiers should be withdrawn 
from panama as quickly as possible members of congress said 
thursday but one said some troops should remain as policemen and 
could still be there on christmas eve a year from now 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said the presence of us soldiers may be required for 
an indefinite period if the panamanian defense forces are unable to 
perform normal police functions and defend the new democratic 
government 
i think the chances are that there is going to be a need for 
them to be there aspin said adding that police and public 
safety operations in panama appeared to have broken down 
manuel antonio noriegas panamanian defense forces performed 
many police functions as well as military ones their headquarters 
was the main target of the first us assault 
aspin said of some us troops i do see a need for them to 
stay i would not be surprised to see them there on christmas eve a 
year from now 
he said that american combat troops were withdrawn from grenada 
two months after the us intervention there but that military 
police units were not removed until 18 months later 
other members of congress said there is a pressing need to move 
far faster in panama 
rep frank mccloskey dind a member of the house armed 
services committee said the most negative situation would 
exist if in 24 hours noriega now a fugitive with a 1 million 
reward offered for his capture was holding hostages or if 
fighting lasted beyond 24 to 48 hours 
id say if we have any kind of significant ongoing hostilities 
or ongoing hostage situation where noriega has some leverage its 
going to be an extremely tense time for the americans he said 
aspin agreed that a combination of an uncaptured noriega a 
faltering government attacks on americans and sporadic sniper fire 
could change positive perceptions of the us action 
you could have this thing turn real sour for george bush real 
quick aspin said 
mccloskey said i backed president bush and the necessity to 
make a military move on noriega given the violence against our own 
military personnel and dependents as in any situation things go 
wrong in the implementation 
i just hope they are supersensitive to concerns for civilian 
casualties both americans and panamanians mccloskey said 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass another committee member said 
there are several positive aspects in the present situation in 
panama 
noriega is not administering the affairs of the government of 
panama that is the key factor he said i think noriegas 
input into the affairs of panama is at an end 
if we can firm up the new government make that government 
secure then the special forces have to come out of there 
mavroules said 
he said that if us forces remain and their stay is seen as 
longterm or indefinite the governments of latin america would be 
extremely upset to see any american military outside of the us 
bases 
thats why its important they get out and that they get out 
just as quickly just as soon as possible mavroules said 
but i cant place any time limit on that the congressman 
said 
much congressional comment has been supportive of bushs action 
in sending thousands of troops against noriega and his forces 
however there has been criticism too 
rep pat schroeder dcolo said as much as we support 
tuesdays us military action in panama we should remember 
that noriega himself is the toxic waste of a polluted reaganbush 
foreign policy 
noriega was aok as long as he did our bidding and supported 
assistance to the contras in nicaragua she said it didnt 
matter if he murdered panamanians or peddled cocaine 
meanwhile the chairman of a subcommittee that controls foreign 
aid said the new government should call elections to revalidate its 
popular support in the face of criticism that it is a 
usinstalled regime 
the new panamanian government will have difficulty 
establishing credibility throughout latin america unless it 
immediately announces that it regards itself as a temporary 
government and will guarantee a new election next year rep 
david obey dwis said in a letter to bush 
elections would mute criticism and could create a much more 
stable situation in panama than would otherwise be the case said 
obey chairman of the house appropriations foreign operations 
subcommittee

near the us embassy in managua on thursday after us troops in 
panama city surrounded the nicaraguan and cuban embassies american 
officials said 
the officials said the turrets of the nicaraguan tanks were 
turned away from the embassy adding that there was no indication 
hostile action was contemplated 
us troops were sent to the nicaraguan and cuban embassies in 
panama city after rumors spread that gen manuel antonio noriega 
may have fled there during the us military invasion 
if the nicaraguan tanks do nothing to disrupt embassy operations 
in managua there is not anything we would want to do to 
escalate the situation said one official who asked not to be 
identified 
otherwise the administration will give deep consideration 
on how to respond he said 
us diplomats told nicaraguan authorities they saw no reason 
for the tank deployment but the nicaraguans said the deployment 
was in response to us activities in panama 
the americans replied that no hostilities were planned against 
the sandinista embassy in panama

french president francois mitterrand urged 
closer links between east germany and western europe but said 
thursday that rash moves toward german unity should be avoided 
mitterrand met communist premier hans modrow and other political 
leaders to express the wests concerns about the possibility of 
german unification 
the two countries signed six agreements including an economic 
and industrial cooperation accord for 199094 as well as one on 
youth exchanges 
the french president also discussed cooperation between his 
socialist party and the east german communist party 
at the brandenburg gate work on creating two pedestrian 
crossings immediately north and south of the gate began at 10 pm 
east german workers used a crane to lift a section of the rounded 
top of the wall then began working on opening the two crossing 
points 
more than 1000 people on the western side cheered and set off 
firecrackers as work began under floodlights 
mitterrand drove by the gate on the eastern side and briefly got 
out of his car to look at it shortly before the work began 
he told the students in leipzig the birthplace of the 
prodemocracy movement that france set conditions but not a 
veto on german unification 
german unity is first and foremost an affair for germans 
france will not stand in the way he said 
only free open democratic elections will permit us to know 
exactly what the germans on the two sides want mitterrand said 
in replies to questions posed by some of the 600 students of 
leipzigs karl marx university 
but the german people must take the european balance into 
account in its decision he added 
since a peaceful peoples revolution forced the ouster of the 
former hardline communist leadership a growing number of east 
germans have called for quick german reunification 
in recent weeks demonstrators at traditional monday rallies in 
leipzig have carried west german flags and shouted for german unity 
with world war ii memories still fresh in many minds european 
leaders have cautioned against quick unification and its 
consequences for postwar stability in europe 
mitterrand said a written treaty could not wipe out european 
realities created after world war ii 
mitterrand arrived in east berlin on wednesday a few hours after 
west german chancellor helmut kohl departed 
kohl and modrow announced the two countries expected to conclude 
a treaty broadly expanding bilateral cooperation in the spring 
the treaty will provide for practical steps to establish close 
links between west germany and east germany in many areas 
kohl also urged east germans to be patient about unification 
saying the process could not come overnight and that germans had to 
consider security implications of such a move 
meanwhile a leader of the new forum opposition group warned 
that the 200000strong movement faced a growing rift 
rolf henrich a cofounder of new forum said the groups 
members were divided on whether to constitute the movement as a 
political party or leave it as a loose organization 
mitterrand also urged the ouster of nicolae ceausescus 
hardline communist leadership in romania where security forces 
have reportedly shot and killed hundreds and possibly thousands of 
antigovernment demonstrators 
it is a regime of personal family power that has no honest 
reason to remain mitterrand said during a meeting with east 
german students in leipzig i think that the days of this regime 
in a europe in full movement are numbered

princess dianas brother and his wife said in a 
television program broadcast thursday that britains tabloid 
newspapers harassed them and fabricated stories in the weeks before 
they were married sept 16 
viscount althorp 25 and his wife the former victoria 
lockwood 24 said events and remarks attributed to them were 
manufactured 
in an interview on hard news a channel 4 television program 
about the news industry viscountess althorp said tabloid 
journalists harassed her and her friends and invaded their privacy 
i think theyre really totally insensitive evil evil 
people she said i dont know how they go home to their wives 
and children and talk about their day with a clear conscience and 
have any selfesteem or selfrespect 
viscount althorp who works as a reporter for the nbctv show 
today as charles althorp said of the tabloid reporters they 
were not content with the story as it stood they wanted to make it 
juicier nastier 
everyday people are bruised by the press and they havent got 
any recourse to speak out and i am doing this because i think i 
ought to and because i am in the position to do so 
his wife criticized a cover story in the sunday mirror of sept 
10 on which the headline was charlies bride in sexy clinch with 
exlover 
if i were going to smooch with an exflame i certainly 
wouldnt do it in a nightclub in front of everybody she said 
a spokesman for maxwell communications which owns the sunday 
mirror said company officials had not seen the program and could 
not comment until they had done so 
althorp said he once found a photographer hiding in bushes 
beside his house when he and miss lockwood were outdoors 
we had a drink on the lawn and i heard this clicking from a 
bush at the end of the garden he said so i raced there and i 
hauled out this photographer who was weighed down with cameras 
darius guppy the couples best man said a news of the world 
journalist tried to get him to agree that the bachelor night party 
degenerated into an orgy 
they were interested in inventing a story that would 
compromise lord althorp which i think was unforgivable he said 
stuart kuttner the news of the world managing editor said his 
paper was interested in covering the althorp engagement and 
wedding but the allegation that the paper was interested in 
inventing a story that would compromise lord althorp is utterly 
without foundation 
indeed the claim does not bear examination since to invent 
without foundation a compromising story would expose the paper to 
the risk of legal proceedings which it would be unable to defend 
kuttner said in short this serious charge is wholly rejected

president bush vowed thursday that american 
troops would scour panama as long as it takes to capture manuel 
antonio noriega he said the loss of american lives in the military 
action has been worth it and called the us commitment 
openended 
expressing sorrow over the deaths bush said military 
casualties are a burden which a nation must endure and all 
presidents have to face up to but which we can never accept 
several congressmen called for the troops to be brought home 
quickly though one rep les aspin chairman of the house armed 
services committee said some might have to remain as policemen 
until christmas eve a year from now 
bush said the operation was openended as far as going after 
noriega openended as far as restoration of order in panama 
a day after ordering 9500 fighting men into panama to join 
more than 13000 already stationed there bush said the military 
mission is not over but pretty well wrapped up 
us forces encountered sporadic firing in panama city but were 
reported in control of several key points in the city including 
the legislative building said pentagon spokesman pete williams 
officials said most units of noriegas panamanian defense forces 
had fled into the jungles and that us troops may be ordered to 
follow them 
bush said that with noriega on the run and a new president 
guillermo endara in place the government is beginning to 
function and the man noriega controls no forces and hes out 
but yes i wont be satisfied until we see him come to justice 
bush made his remarks at a white house news conference at the 
very hour a military aircraft arrived in dover del bearing the 
bodies of some of the americans killed in panama 
the pentagon said 21 troops had been killed in action 208 were 
wounded and one was missing 
in addition an american civilian candy helin 43 was killed 
a schoolteacher of gifted children at a us government school in 
panama she was killed by stray fire from the panamanian defense 
forces officials said 
military hospitals in san antonio texas reported they were 
treating about 190 troops evacuated from panama a higher count 
than reported at the pentagon 
asked if the attempt to catch noriega had been worth the loss of 
life bush said i have to answer yes it has been worth it 
us officials said 59 panamanian soldiers had been killed and 
66 wounded army lt gen tom kelly said us troops had taken 
1500 prisoners most of them regulars from the panamanian defense 
force 
bush said 11 people said to have been abducted by panamanian 
troops from a smithsonian research facility had been freed 
however williams the pentagon spokesman said there were other 
reports of an unknown number of americans being held in three 
separate incidents 
the pentagon said the us offer of a 1 million bounty for 
noriega had prompted many calls but no results 
weve had a lot of nibbles said rear adm ted sheafer an 
intelligence specialist for the joint chiefs of staff 
suddenly the number of reports on his location has gone up 
dramatically he said a lot of it turns out to be very bogus 
bush said thats 1 million bucks id be very happy to sign 
the check for and he joked that noriegas wanted poster will 
be in every post office in town 
noriega is under indictment in the united states on drug charges 
the general dropped from sight and eluded capture as american 
troops landed in panama 
the good news hes out of power bush said the bad news 
he has not yet been brought to justice there is a certain 
level of frustration on that account 
bush said i wont be satisfied until we see him come to 
justice 
asked how long he would chase noriega bush said as long as 
it takes 
defense secretary dick cheney had suggested that some elements 
of the us force might be withdrawn by christmas although the 
white house later suggested that might be overly optimistic 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said we 
certainly arent willing to give a timetable to it but everyone 
recognizes this is not going to be a case of going in wednesday and 
coming out thursday 
the new government doesnt have an easy task fitzwater said 
at his own news briefing dont look for results overnight 
bush used the word invade to refer to the us operation in 
panama but caught himself and changed it to send in those troops 
down into panama 
he acknowledged that he had changed course from october when he 
was criticized for not supporting or joining the effort by 
panamanian officers to overthrow noriega 
the president said i think what changed my mind was the 
death of the marine brutalizing really obscene torture of the 
navy lieutenant and the threat of sexual abuse and the terror 
inflicted on that navy lieutenants wife the declaration of war by 
noriega 
bush said he needs to spell out those incidents to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev whose government has criticized the 
intervention 
bush said that with instances of harassment and death mr 
gorbachev please understand this president is going to do 
something about it 
meanwhile fitzwater said bush still anticipates attending a 
feb 15 drug summit with latin american leaders in cartagena 
colombia even though perus president alan garcia pulled his 
ambassador from washington in protest of the panamanian 
intervention and called for postponing the summit

hundreds of thousands of islamic 
fundamentalists many of them women gathered thursday near the 
national assembly to demonstrate for the dignity of islamic 
women 
the rally was intended as a reply to a recent spontaneous 
demonstration of women at the site to protest islamic extremism and 
demand the strict application of algerias constitution calling for 
equality of the sexes 
many of those at the peaceful gathering were women with their 
heads covered by traditional islamic scarves islam is the official 
religion of this north african country 
about 10000 demonstrators who rallied earlier were joined by 
hundreds of thousands of others strictly separated according to 
gender they blocked streets leading to the government building 
police looked on but no violence was reported loudspeakers 
broadcast verses from the koran the moslem holy book banners 
praised islamic law as the only moral guide and declared that women 
should be honored to wear the hijab the traditional scarf covering 
head neck and ears 
it was the largest demonstration by women in algeria since the 
country gained independence from france in 1962 
the national assembly meanwhile adopted a ban on political 
demonstrations at sites reserved for religious purposes 
the fundamentalists who control most of the 8000 algerian 
mosques have increasingly used their sermons to denounce the 
westernization of algerian society and the decline of strict 
islamic values

western creditors may lend 
yugoslavia up to 4 billion in the next two years if it adopts 
premier ante markovics new marketoriented economic program 
sources and press reports said thursday 
yugoslav banking sources told the associated press the 
international monetary fund agreed to grant yugoslavia an 18month 
standby credit worth 600 million the loan once fully approved 
by imf authorities will be available from jan 1 1990 
yugoslavia hopes the imf will increase that to 900 million for 
a twoyear period said sources close to the negotiations which 
ended in belgrade this week 
the newspaper vecernje novosti said yugoslavia now has a shot at 
obtaining additional western credits because commercial banks and 
governments usually follow the imf lead in gauging whether to keep 
supporting a debtor country 
it quoted national bank vice gov zarko trbojevic as saying the 
world bank the european community the imf and the european free 
trade association have already agreed to grant yugoslavia a total 
of 3 billion in new credits 
italy japan and canada have also given guarantees to supply 
yugoslavia with additional loans worth about 1 billion in the next 
two years if markovics reform package is put into effect vecernje 
novosti said 
the money would be used mainly for importing new western 
technology and restructuring yugoslavias economy and its banking 
system which is being reformed in accordance with western 
standards the sources said speaking on condition of anonymity 
they said money was needed to prop up banks that have been 
backing moneylosing ventures that would lose government subsidies 
under marketoriented reforms 
markovic has apparently won a battle in parliament against 
conservatives who oppose his efforts to introduce market mechanisms 
into the economy now burdened by a 2000 percent inflation rate 
a 17 billion foreign debt and a 17 percent unemployment rate 
his reform package calls for compulsory shutdown of all 
moneylosing firms wide introduction of private and foreign 
investments wage freezes and tight monetary and budgetary controls 
yugoslavia on wednesday became the first communist country to 
introduce convertible currency when part of markovics program was 
adopted in parliament 
communist leaders in serbia yugoslavias largest republic 
oppose markovics efforts to restructure the staterun economy and 
promote greater political pluralism but his measures are likely to 
be adopted despite the opposition 
about 650000 workers held a halfhour warning strike in 
belgrade the capital on wednesday to protest planned austerity 
measures tanjug news agency reported

at least two of the four targets of mailed bombs 
have been sent followup letters apparently from the same person 
threatening further action federal investigators said thursday 
officials would not reveal where the letters were sent or their 
contents 
the four targets of the bombs were federal judge robert s 
vance his court the 11th us circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta savannah attorney robert robinson and the jacksonville 
fla naacp 
vance was killed in his suburban birminham ala home saturday 
when a nailstudded bomb exploded robinson was killed in his 
office by a bomb monday the packages sent to the court and the 
naacp office were defused safely 
there have been followup letters sent since receipt of the 
bomb parcels said leo shatzel a postal inspector in atlanta 
it appears they may have been sent by the individual who sent the 
parcels 
shatzel said the letters were threatening additional mailings 
to other individuals but asked if the letters specifically 
threatened further bombings he replied simply no 
shatzel and fbi officials said a number of letters have come to 
their attention in the wake of the bombings including the two sent 
to targets 
william hinshaw head of the fbis atlanta agency said none of 
the letters specifically claim responsibility for the bombings on 
behalf of a person or group or describe exactly the details of the 
four bombing attempts 
hinshaw said the letters were not sent before the bombings 
which might corroborate a link between the lettersenders and the 
bombings 
shatzel said investigators have to assume there may be a 
relationship between this weeks letters and letters sent in 
august to a jackson miss tv station and other parties 
threatening the 11th circuit court which as hinshaw noted 
thursday does not handle mississippi cases 
the latest letters may be a hoax they may be from other 
persons shatzel said but they may be from an individual who 
did send a bomb 
all four packages have been linked to civil rights court cases 
vance and other 11th circuit judges have handled school 
desegregation and other civil rights cases from georgia alabama 
and florida the jacksonville naacp recently won a school 
desegregation case in the atlanta court and robinson had 
represented the savannah naacp in a school desegregation case 
hinshaw said that while no bombs have been discovered in the 
past two days investigators dare not assume the attacks are over 
a bomb threat was called in thursday to a birmingham ala 
building housing two bankruptcy judges and the internal revenue 
service but no explosive was found 
were fortunate today we didnt turn up any more bombs knock 
on wood he said speaking with reporters at a news conference 
with postal authorities and georgia law enforcement officials 
but we cant say this persons stopped 
fbi spokesman diader rosario in atlanta said agents have 
interviewed everyone whose name appeared on the four parcels but 
we do not consider them suspects or involved in any way shape or 
form 
fbi officials have said at least three of the bombs were mailed 
in georgia in newnan atlanta and macon and all four had 
georgia return addresses the package to robinson may have been 
mailed in macon as well but officials said the postmark on that 
bomb was damaged or blurred 
a macon attorney charles a mathis said wednesday the fbi had 
questioned one of his associates about a 14yearold racial 
discrimination case against the air force as part of the bombing 
investigation 
mathis declined to name the associate or detail what he was 
asked the macon firms clients won a 375 million settlement in 
the case which involved robins air force base in warner robins and 
had been before the 11th circuit

one of two teenagers allegedly 
induced to gamble by staffers of a tabloid tv show testified 
thursday that he was offered free food and lodging for his 
participation but never got it 
city prosecutor steve smoger said the charges of inducing a 
teenager to gamble are the first such case to be prosecuted since 
casino gaming was approved for atlantic city in 1977 
in an effort to convict the two staffers from hard copy a 
nationally syndicated tv news show smoger said he offered a plea 
bargain to andrew pearlstein and jeff gerson both 19 and from 
cherry hill 
the youths pleaded guilty thursday to charges of falsifying an 
application on a drivers license and were fined 250 each 
smoger said the underage gambling charges pearlstein and gerson 
face could be reduced after the resolution of the case against 
hard copy producer ellen gussenberg and reporter daphne 
pinkerson 
ms gussenberg and ms pinkerson face disorderly persons charges 
an offense that carries up to a year in jail and a 2000 fine 
the staffers work as field directors developing stories by 
finding people to interview said jane yollin a spokeswoman for 
the show 
under crossexaminatin by ms guttenbergs attorney carl d 
poplar pearlstein said he and a friend didnt got a free room or 
food from hard copy but he believed that ms gussenberg 
offered them over the telephone 
pearlstein who was on the stand for more than an hour said his 
testimony was not influenced by a lawsuit he is contemplating 
against ms gussenberg and ms pinkerson 
john maroccia attorney for pearlstein and gerson said he would 
decide on the lawsuit in 30 days 
the two youths were arrested aug 18 for allegedly gambling at 
tropworld casino and entertainment resort 
under questioning by smoger pearlstein said ms pinkerson 
called him in july after a friend of his sister suggested he might 
be a good person to contact 
the friend jennifer denmark 21 of cherry hill testified 
earlier that ms gussenberg identified herself as being from mtv 
when she approached her earlier in the month at ballys grand hotel 
amp casino 
ms denmark crying on the stand said she believed ms 
gussenberg wanted to do a feature on youths at the jersey shore in 
the summer but under crossexamination ms denmark said part 
of the conversation dealt with underage gambling 
pearlstein said he drove aug 18 from cherry hill to atlantic 
city with gerson because the idea of a television interview 
appealed to him and because several phone calls from ms pinkerson 
led him to feel sorry for her 
i didnt completely blow her off in the beginning he said 
she was very nice to me and i felt bad for her 
she seemed very persistent and had trouble finding people 
for the show he said 
after their arrest by casino security pearlstein said he told 
state police that they were part of the television program he said 
he then called ms gussenberg 
i said to her that we got arrested and we need you to come 
and take us out pearlstein said she never came 
the trial is expected to resume either jan 8 or jan 9 with 
continued testimony by pearlstein and gerson taking the stand 
smoger said

the organization of american states suspended 
its thursday session five minutes after it opened as 
representatives divided on the wording of a resolution to condemn 
the us military intervention in panama 
oas chairman angus albert khan of trinidad and tobago said he 
had been approached by several delegations asking for more time 
before beginning debate on a resolution submitted wednesday by 
nicaragua he did not say when the session would resume 
nicaraguas leftist government on wednesday introduced a 
resolution calling on the members to condemn the use of force and 
demand the immediate withdrawal of american troops as written the 
measure could be interpreted to include the more than 10000 us 
soldiers permanently based in panama 
the members held firm to oas procedures wednesday and put off 
debate on that resolution for 24 hours they also used established 
procedures to rebuff a request by the usrecognized government of 
guillermo endara in panama to accept a new representative 
instead panama is representated by jose maria cabrera who 
decried the brutal and criminal aggression against his homeland 
and de facto ruler gen manuel antonio noriega 
traditional us allies in speech after speech wednesday spoke 
out against the use of force in the region but the agreement 
stopped there 
oas sources speaking thursday on the condition of anonymity 
said at least two other resolutions were being prepared by the 
latin countries the sources said the new drafts would include a 
condemnation of noriega who is wanted in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges but eluded capture when troops stormed into 
panama city 
the caribbean members said they did not have enough time to 
consult their governments on an appropriate response 
its even more fragmented that that us ambassador luigi 
einaudi said after the session he declined to comment further 
saying only that the united states obviously wont accept 
condemnation 
the oas has not been asked to decide which government it 
recognizes in panama the united states announced wednesday that 
endara was sworn into office hours after the first troops arrived 
he was elected in may in balloting later nullified by noriega 
during the wednesday evening session member nations long 
considered us allies read statements condemning the assault on 
panama the criticism came from chile brazil ecuador guatemala 
haiti and costa rica 
we see abusive practices have not been forgotten and we do not 
accept it we protest it said peruvian ambassador edmundo haya 
de la torre this does not mean we support general manuel antonio 
noriega 
defense for the us assault came from el salvador which said 
the us action supported the freely elected government backing 
also came from canada which holds observer status until it becomes 
a member next year 
canadian representative richard gorham said his government 
regretted the use of force but added we must nonetheless 
again highlight the extraordinary circumstances which have caused 
the united states to act as it has and to support its objective of 
restoring constitutional democratic government to the republic of 
panama 
cabrera accused the united states of slaughtering defenseless 
civilians and said panamanians would not back endara 
he will stay thanks to the bayonets the gunships and the 
tanks of the us army he said no worthy panamanian no 
panamanian who is aware of his homeland can accept guillermo endara 
as president

a federal judge thursday delayed the start of 
john poindexters irancontra trial and demanded to see excerpts 
from former president reagans diaries and notes which poindexter 
wants to use in court 
us district court judge harold greene said president reagan 
shall produce for the courts inspection by jan 7 some of 
the materials sought by poindexter greene will then determine 
whether the material is relevant to the criminal charges against 
reagans former national security adviser 
greene moved back the jan 22 starting date of poindexters 
trial until feb 20 saying a delay is necessary because of pending 
issues those include poindexters subpoenas approved by the 
court seeking reagans documents 
greene quashed major portions of poindexters subpoenas for 
documents from the former president but kept in place the most 
sensitive sections those dealing with reagans diaries notes and 
notebooks 
the court is not disposed to requiring president reagan to 
make wholesale production of documents which ultimately may turn 
out to contain little or no material evidence said the judge 
the obvious answer to this dilemma is an examination 
by the court of the relevant excerpts from the former presidents 
diaries notes and notebooks to determine whether they contain 
specific evidence that should be produced said greene 
greene said legal and historical precedents indicate that a 
review by the judge is appropriate of the presidential papers at 
issue 
the judge said that he will review the reagn documents and 
render a decision on the parts of the reagan diary notes and 
notebooks that must be made available to poindexter 
greene said photocopies and typewritten transcripts may be 
produced rather than the original documents 
poindexter obtained court approval to issue the subpoena for 
reagans documents by submitting a secret paper outlining what he 
believes they contain 
the judge said that reagan and president bush will be permitted 
to see that paper next month if reagan invokes executive privilege 
in response to any decision by greene to turn reagan documents over 
poindexter 
executive privilege is the legal concept by which presidents can 
shield from public disclosure documents used in carrying out their 
constitutional duties in the watergate cases involving president 
nixon courts ruled that the privilege could not be used to protect 
evidence needed in a criminal trial of nixons former aides 
poindexter separately sought approval to subpoena reagan earlier 
this week seeking testimony from the former president in person 
greene set up a schedule for reagans lawyers and president bush 
to file objections to that testimonial subpoena and for 
poindexters lawyers to respond to the objections greene said he 
will rule on the matter sometime after jan 8 
the judge in october outlined poindexters statement of what he 
expected to discover filed in support of a request to issue a 
subpoena to reagan for documents 
reagan met poindexter daily frequently alone and they 
discussed specific matters which now are connected to the criminal 
charges against poindexter the former national security adviser 
says 
the subjects discussed with reagan include the accuracy of a 
chronology prepared by former white house aide oliver north and 
reviewed by poindexter according to greenes outline 
the chronology falsely says no one in the us government knew 
until 1986 that a ciaassisted november 1985 shipment to iran 
contained hawk missiles 
four of the five criminal charges against poindexter relate to 
allegedly lying about the 1985 shipment 
reagan also discussed the administrations view of a house 
resolution inquiring into whether north was raising money and 
supplying military advice to the contras 
poindexter is accused of obstructing congress by sending letters 
endorsing earlier white house denials that north was assisting the 
contras 
poindexter had subpoenaed documents from reagan touching on 67 
meetings or events involving the former president and his national 
security adviser fifty of the meetings or events involved the 
contras and 17 involved the administrations secret arms sales to 
iran according to papers filed in the case 
poindexter also served a subpoena on the archivist of the united 
states who holds presidential documents greene quashed that 
subpoena after the archivist asserted that he already had turned 
over to the prosecutors the documents poindexter was seeking 
in another matter irancontra prosecutors said the restrictions 
the judge placed on norths testimony may make it impossible to 
call him as a witness against his former boss 
greene ruled this week that he would limit norths testimony 
because it might have been tainted by poindexters immunized 
testimony on capitol hill in 1987 the judges decision rules out 
use of most of norths testimony from his trial in april in which 
north frequently mentioned poindexter the office of the 
independent counsel urged greene to permit north to testify to 
all events he currently recalls even if his current 
recollection has been refreshed by poindexters immunized 
testimony 
these limitations may preclude mr north from testifying at 
all concerning conversations and events in which he participated 
and which he currently recalls that are of critical importance to 
this case said the court filing by the independent counsel 
north said last week he doesnt want to testify against 
poindexter prosecutors said norths demonstrated unwillingness 
to answer substantively any question posed to him by the government 
may well preclude from calling this witness at all

the florida supreme court on thursday 
ordered an innocent verdict for a former army soldier of the 
year sentenced to die in the 1978 murder of a young walt disney 
world worker 
the court in a unanimous ruling said there was insufficient 
evidence to convict robert craig cox 30 a former army ranger the 
ruling vacated coxs death sentence reversed his conviction and 
ordered the trial court to acquit him of all charges 
the state showed the possibility that he might have been one 
of several people who could have done it thats not enough in a 
criminal case said larry b henderson an assistant public 
defender in daytona beach who handled coxs appeal 
henderson and the state attorney generals office said it was 
rare for the supreme court to order an innocent verdict usually 
the court sends such cases back for new trials or sentencing 
hearings 
we may ask them to rehear it said richard doran the 
prosecutor in the case for a court to reverse a case and direct 
an aquittal is very rare within my memory theres been maybe one 
or two cases where thats happened since the death penalty was 
reinstated in 1976 
cox was convicted in 1988 of the killing 10 years earlier of 
sharon zellers 19 she disappeared after leaving work dec 30 and 
her badly beaten body was found several days later in an orange 
grove near orlando 
police questioned cox who was in central florida visiting his 
parents but brought no charges he became a suspect because he was 
staying in a motel adjacent to the grove and part of his tongue had 
been bitten off the night before indicating a possible struggle 
the case went unsolved for a decade in the meantime cox was 
named the armys soldier of the year in 1979 henderson said 
and took part in the invasion of grenada in 1983 
in 1986 cox ran into trouble in california and pleaded guilty 
to kidnapping and assault with a deadly weapon he was sentenced to 
nine years in prison and dishonorably discharged from the army 
florida authorities then charged cox with ms zellers murder 
and he was convicted in 1988 cox contended throughout that 
prosecutors had only circumstantial evidence and on thursday the 
supreme court agreed 
the states case hinged on hair otype blood and a boot print 
found in the victims car expert testimony about the hair and 
blood type while saying both could be linked to cox was not 
conclusive the court said 
coxs boots were never compared with the print found in ms 
zellers car the court said the missing piece of tongue was never 
found and no witnesses had seen the two together 
circumstances that create nothing more than a strong suspicion 
that the defendant committed the crime are not sufficient to 
support a conviction the justices wrote 
henderson said cox would likely be transferred from death row at 
the starke prison to orange county where a formal aquittal hearing 
would be held cox then would go to california to finish serving 
his prison term there he said

the bush administration is preparing to reduce 
us ties with romania following that countrys brutal and 
violent crackdown on antigovernment demonstrations us 
officials said thursday 
the officials said the cutbacks could affect programs of 
economic scientific and commercial cooperation with romania and 
that an announcement could come as early as friday 
state department spokesman richard boucher hinted at the 
possibility of sanctions saying the administration was carefully 
reviewing possible steps against romania 
a massacre of undetermined proportions is believed to have 
taken place in romania over the past several days boucher said 
he said the us embassy in bucharest reported that 13 young 
people were killed thursday by automatic weapons fire from 
government security forces during a major demonstration other 
fatalities may have occurred as well he said 
antiregime demonstrations in timisoara and the governments 
brutal and violent crackdown against them continue said boucher 
who noted that some reports put the death toll since the upheaval 
began at several thousand 
it was not clear whether the united states as part of a 
sanctions program is planning to reverse a 1988 decision to send 
to romania weapons grade uranium 
the 164 kilograms of uranium are slated to be used at the triga 
reactor near bucharest a facility for teaching basic research and 
the production of radioactive isotopes such isotopes are commonly 
used in medical tests 
but opponents said the amount of uranium is large enough to make 
a bomb 
us trade with romania has declined sharply since 1988 when 
that country was deprived of the right to sell its exports at the 
lowest possible tariff rates under the socalled most favored 
nation system 
boucher said president nicolae ceaucescu has blamed the unrest 
on fascists and imperialist circles abroad 
in fact however the growing antigovernment movement 
encompasses all of romanias nationalities who are showing their 
unalterable opposition to ceausescu and his policies he said 
boucher said the us ambassador in romania alan green has 
been rebuffed in repeated efforts to deliver a strong protest 
against the crackdown in timisoara 
deputy secretary lawrence eagleburger attempted to see the 
romanian ambassador in washington on wednesday but was told the 
ambassador was unavailable 
we have summoned the romanian ambassador to come to the 
department tomorrow to receive our protest boucher said 
telephone calls to the romanian embassy on thursday were not 
answered 
protests against the repression in romania have been made in 
statements issued by nato the european community and by the 
35nation helsinki group 
members of the warsaw pact of which romania is a participant 
have criticized the romanian actions individually boucher said 
adding that the bush administration has asked the soviet union to 
use whatever influence it has on romania he did not characterize 
the soviet response

a former police deputy chief accused of cheating 
investors and stealing money from the detroit police department was 
arrested thursday on a federal charge of wire fraud officials said 
kenneth weiner was held without bond after a heariang before 
us magistrate virginia m morgan after prosecutors argued 
successfully that there was a risk the former civilian deputy chief 
would flee 
weiner was carryng had dozens of blank checks credit cards and 
valid flight coupons when he was arrested early thursday at detroit 
metropolitan airport in romulus said assistant us attorney 
sheldon light 
the wire fraud charge is related to a pyramid investment scam in 
1985 and 1986 us attorney stephen markman said 
earlier this month weiner was accused of stealing from a 14 
million police secret service fund used for undercover operations 
he had access to the fund from 1980 to 1986 when he left the 
department 
the fbi under a warrant issued by morgan on wednesday arrested 
weiner without incident as he stepped off a plane from los angeles 
fbi special agent in charge hal helterhoff said 
weiners troubles began in 1986 when caine steel co of detroit 
filed a civil lawsuit against him charging that he defrauded the 
company of 379000 
he is suspected of duping as many as 90 investors out of about 
20 million in a scheme that involved gold and silver trading 
weiner 43 resigned as a deputy police chief in 1986 in the 
wake of allegations about the investment scheme in his six years 
with the department he advised police on security and 
antiterrorism practices 
caine steels suit claimed weiner said he represented comsec 
corp and could turn a sizable profit above current market 
interest on its investment the alleged investment scheme used 
new investors cash to provide large returns to previous investors 
such plans collapse when new investors cant be found 
earlier this month police chief william hart said weiner stole 
money from the police secret service fund phony corporations set 
up by weiner in california received checks from the fund 
weiners companies paid 72000 in rent for a beverly hills 
calif house occupied by harts daughter and soninlaw hart 
signed checks to the corporations but denies knowing anything 
about the rent paid on his daughters home 
weiner disappeared in recent weeks as federal and city officials 
investigated the 14million secret police fund as of thursday 
no charges had been filed against him on alleged theft from the 
police department 
mayor coleman young this week reluctantly turned records of the 
fund over to city auditors who found that key documents needed to 
trace money were missing police officials said a theft report was 
filed 
young initially balked at turning over the records because he 
said it could jeopardize undercover operations

day of their offensive they encountered sporadic firing but us 
officials said their forces were in control 
president bush said the military operation was open ended 
indicating it would last as long as necessary to capture gen 
manuel antonio noriega and restore order in panama 
new president guillermo endara addressed the legislative 
assembly under heavy us guard he said he would welcome back 
members of noriegas forces who support democracy 
us troops surrounded the nicaraguan and cuban embassies with 
armored personnel carriers following rumors that noriega may have 
fled there in response nicaraguan troops in armored cars and 
tanks surrounded the us embassy in managua 
a 1 million bounty offer led to a flood of tips and rumors on 
noriegas whereabouts callers placed him in numerous locations in 
panama and in colombia the dominican republic and mexico israeli 
television reported he had been seen on the luxurious island of 
contadora off panamas coast and that he was planning to escape to

the designated un envoy of the 
usinstalled government in panama said thursday that if gen 
manuel antonio noriega is captured he should not be extradited to 
the united states but tried in panama 
later thursday the 15member security council debated the 
panama invasion with many governments denouncing the united 
states but the council could not decide which government to 
recognize noriegas or the usbacked government of guillermo 
endara and no further meeting was scheduled 
both sides have sought to have their ambassadors accredited to 
the united nations which can recognize only one of them 
eduardo vallarino a selfexiled panamanian businessman was 
nominated as panamas un ambassador by endaras government 
installed by us troops at a military base wednesday 
vallarino told a news conference that panamas constitution 
prohibits extradition if noriega is captured by occupying us 
forces he said panama would protest his extradition to face 
narcotics charges in the united states 
i would have to say that probably the panamanian government 
would have to protest vallarino said in answer to a question 
if noriega is apprehended by the authorities in panama he 
will have to be duly charged and tried in panama vallarino said 
but he added that the situation is irregular 
he also said the endara group had not sought us intervention 
in panama but welcomed it 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar in his first comment 
on the us intervention said the position of the un for the 
last 45 years is that we always regret the use of force 
he added that he hoped the security council would reach 
agreement to restore order in panama 
he spoke before the council reconvened at the request of 
nicaragua which along with the soviet union condemned the us 
invasion wednesday night 
nicaragua seeks council condemnation of the us military 
action but the united states and britain could veto any critical 
resolution 
discussion of credentials by the security council is rare and 
has not occurred in recent memory 
the noriega government is not represented in the united nations 
because the previous envoy leonardo kam has been promoted to 
foreign minister that government is trying to accredit as un 
envoy its ambassador to the european community mirla bellavita 
un diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
expected the council would not take up the question of competing 
claims they said the council was likely to ask the 
secretarygeneral for a report the secretarygeneral however had 
said he hoped the council would decide the question 
the question ultimately could be passed on to the general 
assembly diplomats said but according to the un charter the 
159nation assembly cannot take up a question while it is under 
consideration by the council without a request by the council 
the un legal department is studying the question 
the organization of american states in washington declined to 
recognize the endara government wednesday 
vietnams invasion of cambodia in late 1978 posed a similar 
problem for the general assembly which refused to recognize the 
vietnaminstalled government and still recocognizes the ousted 
cambodian government in exile headed by prince norodom sihanouk 
and his allies 
speakers from 10 countries addressed the council thursday and 
all except el salvador denounced the us invasion although some 
also criticized noriega 
el salvador did not specifically endorse the us action but 
criticized noriegas undermining of democracy and 
selfdetermination in panama 
peru was especially vocal in condemning flagrant violation of 
panamas sovereignty in what it called a grim updating of 
imperialist practices 
other speakers included algeria brazil cuba ethiopia finland 
and libya in the first debate wednesday night only britain 
staunchly backed the us action

a threejudge panel on thursday certified 
the election to governor of democrat l douglas wilder in a recount 
that gave him a 6741vote margin over republican j marshall 
coleman 
the recount confirmed wilder as the first black elected governor 
in history with 896936 votes to 890195 for coleman who picked 
up 113 votes in the recount 
the first count of the nov 7 election gave wilder victory by 
6854 votes or fourtenths of 1 percent of the 178 million votes 
cast under state law that margin was close enough for coleman to 
get a recount at state expense 
the first statewide recount in virginia was conducted wednesday 
in the states 136 localities the results were driven to the state 
board of elections 
william h hurd colemans attorney said the republican would 
not challenge the judges decision in the general assembly 
the outcome of this hardfought contest is no longer in 
doubt coleman said in a prepared statement handed to reporters 
as an individual and as the nominee of my party i cannot deny 
that it hurts to come so close and yet fall short coleman said 
but the system has worked the people have spoken and doug 
wilder deserves and will have my full support as our new governor 
wilder also issued a statement declaring that he never had any 
doubt about the outcome 
board of elections employees tabulated the results from each 
voting machine to get totals for each of the states 1967 
precincts and then added those figures to get a total for each 
locality the numbers were checked by independent auditors before 
being passed for inspection to the lawyers for wilder and coleman 
the results are an outstanding tribute to the accuracy and 
integrity of the electoral process said lawrence framme 
chairman of the state democratic party he said it was truly 
amazing that only 113 errors were made of almost 18 million 
votes cast only 113 errors were made 
the republicans however said the process needs to be changed 
to prevent felons from registering to vote hurd said the coleman 
camp found 3000 to 4000 felons on the voter rolls and he 
estimated that 2000 to 3000 voted 
earlier hurd had called the recount a very worthwhile 
proceeding as i think the results will bear out 
circuit judges melvin r hughes jr of richmond robert w

the comandancia complex that was 
the nerve center for manuel antonio noriegas regime is a dank and 
gutted ruin today bristling with us soldiers trying to root out 
the last snipers of the dictators forces still roaming the city 
a group of reporters escorted into the area for a look at the 
sites of the heaviest fighting in the us invasion were hustled 
back into the van with a warning from soldiers there was 
occasional sniper fire from a highrise apartment building that 
makes a backdrop to the comandancia 
the entrance to the area a poor section of panama city called 
chorrillo was littered with the wreckage of three cars across the 
intersection someone had painted on the bottom of a billboard 
yanqui go home 
soldiers backed a tanklike personnel carrier into the burnedout 
remains of a laundry commanding a view of a nearby intersection 
up the street a hydrant gushed water into the gutter adding to the 
stench of the burned and soaked rubble streets were filled with 
twisted corrigated metal roofing burned stocks of weapons pieces 
of blocks and tile highrise buildings were deserted and large 
portions of the area had been reduced to blackened rubble and 
twisted pipes 
outside the commandancia an iron fence was strung with colored 
lights for christmas walls were blackened or pocked with 50 cal 
bullet holes or simply blown away the roof was twisted and iron 
bars hung limply from the windows said one soldiers there was 
an awesome amount of firepower put on this place 
a broken scene in front of the commandancia lay is disarray the 
plastic figures shattered at the end of the block a soldier 
points out the g2 headquarters where it is alleged much of 
the harassment of detained americans had occurred the structure 
had much less damage than the turquoiseandwhite commandancia 
building 
at the edge of the rubble of the several blocks around the 
commandancia was a grisly scene from the early fighting a compact 
car mashed to onethird its height with a body sprawled across the 
remains of the front seat soldiers explained that when the us 
assault moved into the area a patrol found the auto with its 
occupants handing out ak47 assault rifles to noriega fighters one 
us armored personnel carrier just rolled over the car a soldier 
said thirty feet down the street was a similarly squashed hulk of 
anorther small car 
among the graffiti and advertising placards of the downtown area 
could frequently be seen the painted slogqn yanqui go home 
noriegas visage smiled out from the sides of some of the 
buildings in paintings that carried the slogan general of peace 
a commander for a long while or for panama my life not a

into the streets of bucharest thursday and security forces with 
submachine guns fired on young demonstrators protesting his iron 
rule killing at least 13 people 
in washington the state department said a massacre of 
undetermined proportions was believed to have taken place the 
last few days officials said the bush administration was preparing 
to reduce ties with romania and hinted at possible sanctions 
petar tomic a yugoslav journalist in the closed country said 
an armored vehicle crushed two students other students rushed to 
their aid and security forces opened fire killing or wounding 
about 20 people he said other people were shot down but he did 
not have a casualty count 
clashes were reported in at least two other cities thursday a 
polish couple interviewed by hungarian television said that in the 
eastern city of arad soldiers fired on about 3000 demonstrators 
they said they saw some students ordered out of a college made 
to stand up against a wall and shot dead when the alleged shooting 
occurred was not clear 
american diplomats counted at least 13 people felled by 
automatic weapons fire and said more were possible according to 
state department spokesman richard boucher 
jonathan lamb first secretary at the british embassy in 
bucharest told british broadcasting corp tv that two of his 
colleagues had seen the bloodied bodies of eight or nine young 
people with head wounds and guessed there could be many more 
one of my colleagues stepped over a dead body he said 
two of my colleagues have been towards another demonstration near 
the american embassy and they have found bodies in the streets 
he said he had no doubt security forces had fired on 
protesters 
it was the first violence in the capital since hundreds 
possibly thousands of anticeausescu demonstrators reportedly were 
shot and killed by security forces last weekend in the 
transylvanian city of timisoara 500 miles from bucharest 
by 3 pm the official yugoslav news agency tanjug and the 
bulgarian state news agency bta said from bucharest firing had 
stopped elderly people urged troops not to act against the 
protesters bta said 
by early evening however yugoslav radio and tass reported more 
bursts of automatic weapons fire 
the streets are becoming more and more animated tass said 
adding that romanian state tv had not begun its customary broadcast 
at 800 pm 
the demonstators are surrounded by romanian army soldiers 
special troops armed with truncheons and plastic shields and 
security forces tass said choppers are patrolling over the 
city 
the tass correspondent said he was told by a man in plain 
clothes who identified himself as a representative of the 
working people who helps to preserve order that there was no 
loss of life 
the man said people who were seen being carried to ambulances 
had no time to dine got overexcited and fainted 
mass protests began after ceausescu was shouted down while 
addressing an official rally in a downtown square in the capital 
an occurrence unheard of in the nation he has treated like a feudal 
fiefdom for 24 years official media switched off live coverage 
when the jeering started 
last weekend in timisoara 30 miles from the hungarian and 
yugoslav borders police and soldiers opened fire on crowds 
shouting bread and down with ceausescu estimates of 
deaths there range from hundreds to 4000 
resistance to ceausescu who on wednesday returned from a 
threeday official visit to iran spread to other cities in 
transylvania to moldavia in the north and on thursday to bucharest 
clashes were also reported thursday in arad and cluj in 
transylvania general strikes were reported in timisora and arad 
ceausescu 71 faces his most serious challenge with no support 
and much criticism from warsaw pact allies whose societies are 
being transformed by a democratic tide the downfall of the old 
guard elsewhere in eastern europe has made ceausescu the 
longestserving communist ruler 
journalists have not been admitted to romania since the weekend 
and the travel of those already in the country is severely 
restricted 
hungarian radio said in an early evening broadcast that 
protesters chanted the army is with us indicating some 
soldiers were unwilling to fire at demonstrators but also quoted 
hungarian defense ministry spokesman gyoergy keleti as saying 
romanian security forces wore military uniforms 
yugoslav media quoting witnesses reported that soldiers and 
police who refused to fire on antigovernment protesters in 
timisoara were executed they did not say when the executions 
occurred 
yugoslav radio said there were unconfirmed reports of strikes in 
factories and that students were promoting a general strike 
hungarian radio said the communist partys ruling politburo was 
meeting in unannounced session probably discussing the unrest 
timisoara was reported near open revolt 
according to accounts coming from journalistic circles 
enterprises plants and factories arent working in timisoara 
tass reported they have been occupied by workers who have 
warned that if their conditions arent met they will blow up these 
enterprises 
the conditions include a demand for the governments 
resignation and a demand that party officials military and other 
leaders who allowed loss of life in the town be called to account 
it said the workers demanded withdrawal of the army and 
according to the latest information the military units have 
started to leave 
a romanian who crossed to yugoslavia said tanks were withdrawn 
from timisoara after workers occupying a large petrochemical plant 
and threatened to blow it up 
a romanian traveler arriving in yugoslavia said he also had 
heard of protests thursday in craiova in the south and suceava in 
the north 
reports of continuing trouble in timisoara suggested ceausescu 
obtained little effect by declaring a state of emergency in the 
region wednesday night that set an 11 pm curfew and banned 
gatherings of more than five people 
foreign minister gyula horn of hungary said he had heard of 
clashes between security forces and some army units and that 
there was a serious political movement against ceausescu 
french president francois mitterrand said ceausescus days in 
power are numbered 
a french radio station said romanian exiles in rome had 
announced the desire to form a governmentinexile 
at the official rally at which ceausescu spoke hundreds of 
people began to boo and jeer and thousands more soon joined in 
tomic journalist said 
live radio transmission was interrupted for about three minutes 
as the protesters approached and booed and jeered ceausescu whose 
austerity programs and other harsh policies have imposed rationing 
and other hardships on his 23 million people 
suddenly there was a highpitched noise on the radio then 
patriotic music was played for about three minutes before 
ceausescus speech resumed in midsentence later broadcasts of the 
speech were edited to omit the jeers

diplomat said street protesters could be heard chanting down 
with ceausescu freedom and timisoara timisoara

israeli troops shot and killed two palestinians 
on thursday after soldiers were stoned as they tried to arrest 
uprising activists in a west bank village the army said 
five other palestinians two of them women suffered gunshot 
wounds in the incident arab reports said 
in the occupied gaza strip 21 palestinians were shot and 
wounded in scattered stonethrowing clashes with israeli troops 
arab reports said 
the military confirmed seven wounded in gaza and five in the 
west bank 
also thursday more than 150 palestinian university 
administrators and professors launched a campaign to demand israel 
to reopen colleges and universities closed by the army almost since 
the start of the palestinian uprising 
at an organizational meeting the group said that the closures 
in the west bank and gaza since january 1988 were depriving 42000 
palestinians of an education and seriously damaging the finances of 
the institutions 
we are being banned from a basic right access to schools and 
universities adib khatib a vice president at annajah 
university in nablus told the meeting in jerusalem this 
collective punishment must be brought to an end 
the deaths occurred in beit furik a village of about 5000 
people near nablus 
the army said soldiers raiding the village were attacked with 
stones and concrete blocks and that one officer was lightly wounded 
in the face 
the soldiers shot a number of plastic bullets at the stone and 
block throwers the army said later it was reported that two 
were killed 
the victims ayesh wajeeh khatatbeh 17 and zahi tawfik 
hannani 21 both were hit in the head arab reports said 
the deaths raised to 633 the number of palestinians killed by 
israelis since the start of the palestinian revolt in december 1987 
fortythree israelis also have been slain and 161 other 
palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of 
collaborating with israel 
in the west bank town of bethlehem soldiers putting up strings 
of colored lights for christmas eve choir services were stoned by 
palestinian youths wearing green head bands of the islamic jihad 
fundamentalist movement witnesses said 
the soldiers were decorating because palestinian municipal 
officials have canceled christmas festivities in solidarity with 
the uprising the troops chased the stone throwers but no arrests 
were reported 
the army announced thursday that it has adopted rules to punish 
the parents of child stone throwers in the gaza strip by 
confiscating property or sealing off rooms in houses 
the spokesman said the steps were being taken because minors 
those under age 12 cannot be jailed under israeli law 
all this is because we cant put the boy in jail said the 
spokesman who cannot be identified under military regulations 
the new rules require parents to post bail if a child is caught 
throwing stones repeatedly the spokesman said that if a family 
refused to pay the army could confiscate property or seal a room 
of the familys house

larry mahoney was convicted thursday of 
27 counts of seconddegree manslaughter in the nations deadliest 
alcoholrelated traffic crash which claimed the lives of 27 people 
riding home from a church outing 
the jury also convicted mahoney on 12 counts of firstdegree 
assault and all but one of the 42 wanton endangerment counts he was 
charged with in the fiery crash on may 14 1988 
i accept your verdict mahoney later told jurors and 
collapsed in tears 
mahoney a 36yearold chemical plant worker escaped a possible 
life sentence when the jury opted for the less serious charge of 
manslaughter which carries a maximum prison sentence of five to 10 
years he had been charged with 27 murder counts but the jurors 
had the option of two lesser charges 
the only acquittal was on a charge of wanton endangerment of 
clint bradley a motorist whose car nearly was struck by mahoneys 
pickup which was traveling the wrong way down an interstate 
highway 
defense attorneys had acknowledged that mahoney was drinking on 
the day of the accident however they argued that a defective bus 
design was the primary cause of the deaths and that he had been 
tricked into drunkenness 
the jury deliberated about 11 hours and returning shortly before 
4 pm when the lengthy verdict was read in carroll county circuit 
court jurors decided to begin immediately the penalty phase of the 
trial in which they would make a sentencing recommendation to 
circuit judge charles satterwhite 
mahoney took the witness stand during the sentencing hearing and 
told the jurors that he intended after prison to warn 
schoolchildren of the dangers of drinking and driving 
i know god kept me alive for a reason mahoney said i 
accept your verdict i want you to know i dont feel bad toward 
you in any way 
if at least one school child heeds his warning mahoney said 
at least that will be one life saved 
after the onehour hearing the jury decided to quit for the 
night and resume its work friday in recommending the sentence to 
satterwhite two jurors were sick said william summers a defense 
attorney 
besides the manslaughter penalty mahoney could be punished more 
severely for firstdegree assault which carries a possible 
sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison firstdegree wanton 
endangerment is punishable by one to five years in prison 
the judge decides whether the prison sentences are served at the 
same time or consecutively 
mahoney bowed his head slightly his eyes fixed on the tabletop 
before him as the judge slowly read the verdict on each of the 82 
counts mahoney remained composed throughout but members of his 
family broke down in tears 
mahoneys sister judy odonovan patted him and whispered to 
him before he was led from the courtroom mrs donovan later said 
she told him that everythings going to be all right and that i 
love him 
on the other side of the courtroom crash survivors and victims 
families also reacted emotionally some covering their mouths or 
touching and holding one another for support 
before he read the verdicts satterwhite warned spectators that 
there should be no outbursts 
he advised all those in the courtroom to envision the worst 
verdict from each persons standpoint prepare themselves and if 
you dont think you can handle it leave the courtroom now no 
one left 
under kentucky law the jury had immediately recommended a 
penalty for drunken driving and it set mahoneys punishment at 30 
days in jail with a 500 fine 
mahoney was driving his pickup in the wrong direction on 
interstate 71 near carrollton when it rammed headon into a bus 
killing 24 children and three adults who belonged to the radcliff 
first assembly of god church 
mahoneys lawyers said he admitted being drunk and driving north 
in the southbound lanes of the divided highway striking the 
churchowned former school bus as it returned a youth group from a 
cincinnati amusement park but the defense said faulty design of 
the bus gas tank not the collision caused the explosion and fire 
that killed the victims 
the former school bus fuel tank ruptured and the bus burst into 
flames killing 24 children and three adults forty people escaped 
but 12 were severely burned 
autopsies showed the fire not the crash killed the victims 
the jury began deliberating wednesday afternoon 
its in my mind that i might go to jail but another part of 
my mind says everything will come out all right mahoney said in 
an interview published in thursdays editions of the 
courierjournal of louisville 
relatives of many of the victims watched wednesday as mahoneys 
lawyers and special prosecutor paul richwalsky gave closing 
arguments in the trial that began with jury selection nov 8 
lead defense attorney william summers said mahoney had been 
beaten by public opinion like a cur dog since the crash 
this tragedy needs to be put behind people summers said 
everyone needs to begin rebuilding their lives the world has to 
start anew 
richwalsky an assistant attorney general said it was difficult 
to reconcile the spirit of the season with the task before the 
jury but he told jurors they should not be more charitable 
toward mahoney and his family because christmas was near 
summers and cocounsel jack hildebrand stressed the twin themes 
of mahoneys defense that his intoxication was unintentional and 
that the bus was unsafe because of a vulnerable fuel tank and seats 
that spewed toxic fumes as they burned

panamas newly installed leaders met 
with members of the last legislative assembly and other public 
figures under heavy us guard thursday trying to gain control of 
the country and declaring a dusktodawn curfew 
gunshots echoed in the streets outside as president guillermo 
endara and vice presidents ricardo arias calderon and guillermo 
ford presided over the meeting which contained the incongruous 
spectacle of us soldiers in jeans sweatshirts and other civilian 
clothes sprinkled throughout it 
in his speech to an audience of about 200 endara held out an 
olive branch to followers of deposed dictator gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
endara his vice presidents and members of the audience sang 
with special feeling their national anthem and one line in it we 
have finally achieved our victory 
endara ordered a 6 pm to 6 am curfew in hopes of maintaining 
law and order as thousands of looters roamed the streets smashing 
in windows and hauling away goods from virtually every shop in the 
city 
us troops were too busy with snipers and small bands of armed 
noriega loyalists to challenge the looters 
the new government by the accounts of most foreign observers 
overwhelmingly won an election on may 7 but noriega cancelled it 
and continued his rule 
at the time endara and ford were beaten by members of one of 
noriegas dignity battalions units who are still wrecking 
havoc in the aftermath of the us military takeover that started 
early wednesday morning 
two close aides to endara jailed by noriega over a month ago 
and feared by opposition members to have been tortured or killed 
appeared suddenly at the podium at the start of the session and 
were embraced by endara and his two vice presidents to a warm 
ovation 
the two men miguel batista and ivan mojica were spirited away 
by noriegas police and had not been heard from since they were 
freed from a jail by us troops on wednesday 
several people attending the session said they were grateful for 
the us intervention 
the united states is responsible for delivering the dream we 
have had since 1968 said cattleman felix espansona an assembly 
member in 19521956 
we have had a dictatorship for 20 years and now we feel 
liberated 
endara called the new leadership the national reconstruction 
government in a brief speech he made no threats of retaliation 
against followers of noriega now the subject of a nationwide 
manhunt by the us military and with a 1 million reward offered 
by the white house for his capture 
in a bid for unity endara said he would welcome back members of 
noriegas defense forces who can show they support our 
democracy 
vice president ford said it will take some time to restore 
order but us troops should leave the sooner the better 
he also said it is highly important for our country that 
general noriega be caught and be brought to justice 
a top us military official agreed that noriegas capture is 
critical in restoring law and order 
its a problem because as long as you have the head of the 
snake and you have parts of the snakes body and he can make the 
tapes like he did yesterday then youll have some number of 
hardcore loyalists said lt col bill bennett chief of 
contingency operations plans in us southern command 
the endara government strongly backed by president bush met 
amid tight security provided by dozens of us troops who were all 
dressed in civilian clothes 
panamanian politicians did not want to give the impression of 
total dependence on us supports so the soldiers were asked not 
to wear their uniforms several of them told reporters 
looking out of place with their crewcuts and bluejeans they sat 
in the audience to prevent trouble in the national assembly 
building 
while the speeches were being delivered inside the government 
building shots rang out across the street scattering scores of 
looters and curiosity seekers from outside the wroughtiron gates 
around the assembly 
a us officer in charge of security dismissed it as a minor 
incident only some shopkeeper firing shots into the air to scare 
away a looter the officer told a reporter 
government officials said all public offices and buildings would 
be closed for the next two days virtually everything in panama 
has been closed 
since the us attack and it was unclear when they might 
reopen 
the major exception was the panama canal which resumed full 
operations at dawn thursday military officials said dozens of 
cargo ships were offshore awaiting a chance to go through the canal 
the opposition to the american military takeover in the capital 
city was mostly disorganized said bennett but some noriega 
military units remained in the countryside and would have to be 
dealt with 
with the operation more than 30 hours old the us completed 
taking control of the national assembly building demolished 
noriegas former headquarters and took control of other key points 
in the city 
late wednesday soldiers from the 82nd airborne division swept 
through the downtown marriott hotel where some americans were 
trapped 
bennett estimated that some 3000 of the 24000 us troops 
involved in the operations were military police who would be 
taking over police duties formerly carried out by noriegas forces 
their mission will be to reestablish law and order in panama 
city he said 
one of the primary duties will be to identify and hand over 
duties to panamanian police officers who will be loyal to a 
democratic government he said 
as the police units take over downtown attack units would turn 
their attention to routing out the remaining noriega loyalists 
elsewhere a job which would be made easier if noriega is found 
and captured 
without noriega as a rallying point a lot of the units out 
there that have been sitting on the fence will be calling to tell 
us that they will support the democratic government he said 
us officers reported that there was a mortar fired overnight 
near fort clayton a major us military installation but had no 
details of any damage 
they also reported that a special unit seized a 65foot 
panamanian boat near the bridge of the americas spanning the panama 
canal they captured 18 armed men aboard but found no explosives

susan atkins who fatally stabbed 
pregnant actress sharon tate during the charles manson family 
killings 20 years ago was denied parole for a ninth time wednesday 
in rejecting her bid for release the state parole board noted 
that atkins was involved in three incidents resulting in the 
premeditated murder of eight people for the bizarre motive of 
starting a race war 
atkins 41 who is serving a life sentence on eight murder 
convictions that included the 1969 tatelabianca slayings wont 
get another parole hearing until december 1992 the threemember 
board decided 
atkins with other manson followers was convicted of murder and 
conspiracy in 1971 for the murders of miss tate and four others at 
the actress home and of for slayuing grocer leno labianca and his 
wife at their home the next night 
prosecutors argued during the manson family trial that the 
killings were part of mansons plot to incite chaos or helter 
skelter that would result in a black vs white civil war 
manson who expected ultimately to take control of the country 
when the fighting ended is serving a life prison sentence and has 
repeatedly been denied parole 
miss tate who was 8 months pregnant was stabbed 16 times by 
atkins and charles tex watson who is serving a life sentence 
in the california mens colony in san luis obispo 
presiding commissioner rudolph castro called the crimes among 
the most heinous and callous ever committed in california if not 
in the nation 
the actress mother doris tate addressed the board 
anyone has an alternative to do right i dont understand why 
anyone would murder an innocent pregnant woman she said the 
thing that goes continually through my mind is the lack of 
compassion susan had for sharon 
when sharon begged for her life susan said shut up bitch 
youre going to die and after they stabbed her 16 times they hung 
her i have nothing but contempt for this individual 
prosecutor stephen kay a los angeles county deputy district 
attorney told the board the release of atkins would be one of 
the most dangerous things this board can do 
atkins said she realized she might spend the rest of her life 
behind bars for acts she called unforgivable 
i take the blame atkins told the board not only am i 
being punished but i deserve to be punished for what i did 
atkins attorney deborah fraser said although her clients 
crimes should not be excused the board should put aside political 
considerations and offer her a release date she cited a 1989 
psychiatrists report that found atkins less dangerous than the 
average inmate

when technicolor was first tested in the 
1930s the onscreen results raised some wellpenciled eyebrows 
the hills were green the grass was green and the actors faces 
were green 
max factor hollywoods beauty guru realized makeup was 
reflecting the color of the scenery so he headed to his shop 
experimented and delivered a makeup that dried to a dull finish he 
packaged the new product in round flat containers for lack of a 
better name factor called it pancake makeup 
it was one in a series of innovations offered by the russian 
immigrant during a hollywood career that spanned 29 years 
the name max factor was synonymous with movie glamour for 
decades but his true gift to hollywood was to make actors appear 
natural instead of glamorous 
factors contributions to good looks can be seen at the max 
factor makeup museum in hollywood founded in 1984 by curator bob 
salvatore a 23year employee of max factor amp co 
max saved technicolor and at the same time he invented modern 
makeup salvatore said max knew he had something when the 
actresses started stealing the pancake for their own use 
salvatore admits the museum is part historical preservation and 
part publicity for the company now owned by revlon inc admission 
is free and the museum shop is a max factor retail outlet 
unlike the touristoriented hollywood wax museum or the 
fredericks of hollywood bra museum with its exhibit of celebrity 
undergarments the factor museum is notable for its quiet elegance 
the main lobby has antique glass and wood cases displaying 
powder lipstick and perfume containers from past decades four 
color rooms where beauty treatments were once given branch 
off from the lobby 
when the rooms were added to the salon in 1935 each was 
dedicated by an actress the blonde room painted in shades of blue 
was dedicated by jean harlow the redhead room in green hues by 
ginger rogers the brunette room in rose colors by claudette 
colbert and the brownette room in peach by rochelle hudson 
a woman could walk into the room for her color and immediately 
be surrounded by a flattering environment salvatore said 
for factor applying makeup was as much science as art the 
beauty calibrator is a reminder of his search for the perfect 
face a quest salvatore said that was never satisfied 
the contraption a mass of metal bands and pointers circling a 
mannequins head was patented by factor in 1932 to measure the 
distance between the eyes the length of the chin and other aspects 
of a womans face with that information factor would apply makeup 
to camouflage natures imperfections 
another factor invention on display is the kissing machine he 
wanted his lipsticks to withstand a perfect 10pound kiss 
that salvatore said is a respectable goodbye kiss between a 
husband and wife any more than that and they are on their own 
factor hired a man and woman to test the indelibility of new 
lipsticks but the pair who were married to other people soon 
tired of the work and quit factor had rubber molds made of the 
kissers lips and attached them to a handoperated machine that 
pressed the fake lips together 
the factor saga in america began in 1904 when he arrived in st 
louis to run his display at the worlds fair after the fair he 
stayed on operating a barber shop for five years factor had 
40000 in gold when he arrived in the united states but lost most 
of it through bad business deals 
after moving to los angeles in 1909 he opened a barber shop in 
the theater district and made wigs and makeup for stage clientele 
filmmakers soon sought him out with makeup problems 
one early problem he tackled was converting stage greasepaint to 
film makeup the early film monochromatic did not register red 
so cheeks and lips looked black on the screen factor mixed up 
colors that would look natural 
max factor was not only the most important force in hollywood 
makeup he was the only source that was interested in movie 
makeup said howard smit a 30year veteran of the makeup and 
hairstylists union this wasnt a product that you could make for 
the masses 
the first film for which factor had a contract to do all the 
makeup and hair was vogues of 1938 
factors sons max jr and davis carried on the legacy when he 
died in 1938 the family sold the company in the 1970s it was 
owned by beatrice corp and others until 1985 when revlon purchased 
it 
during that time the company expanded into a 
multimilliondollar international cosmetics firm that prosperity 
was fueled by the use of dozens of stars such as loretta young and 
bette davis in celebrity ad campaigns unequaled before or since a 
few of the ads appearing in international publications between 
192847 are on display at the museum 
it was not love of factors makeup that attracted the big names 
the actresses had little choice they were told by the studios to 
pose for factor ads salvatore said it was a relationship that 
benefited both factor and the studios 
at the time he was shipping his makeup all over the world and 
european sales for movies were even more lucrative than american 
salvatore said the ads would say barbara stanwyck in double 
indemnity and it would be like advance advertising for the 
movie and max got to use a very recognizable face in his ads here 
no money ever changed hands not a penny 
hollywood recently knocked on max factors door again director 
jack nicholson wanted to use the museum to film a scene for the 
movie the two jakes a sequel to chinatown set in the late 
1940s 
in the scene actress meg tilly a brunette comes to the salon 
to have a facial 
they filmed it in the blonde room salvatore said max 
would have been appalled

zip from santas in tights to eight 
maidsamilking zip from ebenezer scrooges london to christmas 
in new york 
and in they step the highkicking rockettes and other 
performers from one costume to the next in a backstage 
choreography with the precision timing of their onstage routines 
as radio city music hall puts on its annual christmas shwo 
dressers carrying plastic laundry baskets run with the clothes 
dropped by one of the 79 cast members as he switches from the 
london of tiny tim to the dancing rooftops of new york lined up 
for each dancer in the production number are his tuxedo pants 
suspenders fancy dressfront bow tie and tailcoat in the order in 
which theyll be donned there also are black socks and patent tap 
slippers and a shoehorn beside each pair 
the backstage choreography timing and rhythm is as 
important as the choreography on stage said bree daniels who 
has been a dresser for seven years three at the music hall 
behind all this kinetic energy is the tiny trim blonde whose 
costumes are constructed built sewn stamped and stretched with 
this kind of activity in mind and shes been doing it for 40 years 
leanne mitchell director of the music halls mammoth costume 
shop constructs wings for sugar plum fairies dresses santas 
elves sews buttons for wooden soldiers stamps on sequins for 
rockettes fashions swaddling clothes and drapes the brightly 
colored silks of the three wise men 
mitchell left her home in iowa to come to new york and in 1949 
at the age of 19 she was hired by the music hall as a seamstress 
the rest as they say is show biz 
she still remembers her first glimpse soon after she arrived in 
new york of the enchanted stage where today live camels bow to the 
stableborn child where the precisiondancing rockettes bring 
wooden soldiers to heel where christmas trees spring to life she 
even remembers the movie that played a date with judy 
starring elizabeth taylor and jane powell 
she still seems slightly titillated by the glamour of it all and 
admits she was awed by the girls of the chorus line when she first 
joined the staff 
i was their age when i came here she says her mother told 
her later that at the age of 8 she had written an essay saying that 
someday she was going to come to new york and make clothes for the 
rockettes 
they dont want something that doesnt fit them right we have 
to live with those costumes we have to make them so theyll 
last she said drawing a comparison between oneshot shows on 
television and the live spectacular on the music halls vast stage 
with its 43foot turntable 3ton motorized curtain and 38piece 
orchestra that rises from its pit and moves across the stage not 
to mention three live camels and several sheep and donkeys that 
bed down in the basement waiting for their stage cues for the 
nativity scene 
the hardworking rockettes will do their christmas show 188 
times in the eight weeks of its run through jan 3 more than 1 
million people are expected to see the show in the cavernous art 
deco theater that seats 5874 
whats changed not a lot except stretch fabrics and punchin 
rhinestones and ironon sequins the unforgettable collapse in slow 
motion of the line of 36 wooden soldierrockettes is pretty much 
what audiences of the first christmas show saw in december 1933 
variety reported in 1934 that the slow motion had gotten slower 
fabrics with added give have made life a lot easier says 
mitchell whose work force varies from 6 to 30 depending on the 
season they made the 350 costumes used in the christmas show but 
her 26500 budget for this season was only for refurbishing and 
making totally new costumes for two numbers out of 12 the 
seamstresses are included in the 123 support staff for the 117 
actors and musicians 
her job is to make clothes that fit the body move with the body 
and reveal as much of it as possible in the case of the 
highstepping rockettes 
during the scene preceding the 12 days of christmas the 
womens dressers drop long puffyskirted costumes at designated 
spots so each rockette coming off stage in an abbreviated santa 
outfit can strip to her bodysuit and step into a 12 days dress 
almost in a stride a dresser moves in and zips 
actors who switch in a wink from nutcracker bears who cavort to 
tchaikovskys waltz of the flowers to dancing christmas trees 
with twinkling lights and green felt arms need fast changes and 
freedom to move

the abused and trampled can win thats the legacy of hanukkah 
it was demonstrated in the origins of that jewish holiday and also 
resonates in present surges toward religious freedom in communist 
lands 
the point that the weak but principled can triumph over the 
mighty was etched in that ancient jewish victory which preserved 
the mother faith and also the roots of christianity and islam 
their rise hinged on the heritage of hanukkah whose eightday 
observance begins at sundown friday it commemorates the amazing 
feat of the maccabeeled insurgents in overthrowing a 
religioncrushing totalitarianism 
all three major monotheistic faiths judaism christianity and 
islam owe an enormous debt to the maccabees said rabbi a 
james rudin interreligious affairs director of the american jewish 
committee 
if that victory had not occurred the ruthlessness of imperial 
power likely would have washed out and eliminated jewish life as 
jesus knew it rudin added 
but in that first war for religious freedom the groundwork 
endured not only for judaism but also for its two offspring faiths 
the successful outcome in 165 bc came after a lopsided 
threeyear war in which relatively small tattered bands of jewish 
guerrillas finally beat off the worlds then mightiest military 
power the syrian empire 
the courage and faith of the few prevailed over overwhelming 
odds said rabbi henry michelman executive vice president of the 
synagogue council of america embracing all three wings of judaism 
it was the miracle of freedom over tyranny he said citing 
parallels between that event and the emergence of persisting 
freedom movements in eastern europe 
the whole history of activism and dissent is of minuscule 
handfuls of people through stubbornness and conviction being able 
to resist the mighty empires he added 
the lonely suppressed voices ultimately are sustained 
rudin said that more and more were seeing the weak overcoming 
the strong the power of an idea we see it in czechoslovakia in 
east germany poland and elsewhere its the theme of hanukkah 
over and over again the folly of the world is that if 
military power is sufficient it is controlling but monotheism 
freedom democracy have their own greater strength 
in the ancient epic struggle syrias despotic antiochus had 
conquered most of the middle east he ordered all subjects to 
worship the state pantheon of gods and the destruction of all 
vestiges of judaism 
scripture scrolls were burned synagogues razed sabbath 
services forbidden a defiling statute to the pagan jupiter was 
erected in the jerusalem temple thousands of jews were slain 
though most complied 
pagan altars were erected throughout israel and patrols 
deployed to force villagers to bow and make offerings to the new 
gods 
but revolt broke out when the aging maccabee father of five 
sons refused and killed a syrian officer 
the maccabees fled to the hills and gradually gathered a scanty 
illequipped but growing army of resistance fighters a few 
against the syrian many but their leader judas maccabee the 
hammerer said 
in the sight of heaven there is no difference between 
deliverance by many or by few so do not be afraid of them 
the long relentless struggle marked the first successful use of 
guerrilla tactics lightning strikes and retreats surprise 
attacks ambushes night raids and harassment 
in the final decisive battle the overwhelmingly outnumbered 
maccabee force of only 3000 routed a syrian army of 47000 
including horsemen foot soldiers and spearmen mounted on elephants 
it was a turning point for civilization in the preservation of a 
monotheistic religious heritage that has spread around the earth 
through its descendant faiths 
in successfully throwing off the yoke of religious 
suppression judaism was able to go on and many years later from 
its womb came the other monotheistic faiths michelman said 
those successive events had a direct historical correlation 
he said 
after the maccabean victory the jerusalem temple was cleansed 
and rededicated 
legend says that there was only enough oil for the temple lamps 
to burn one day but miraculously they burned eight days until more 
oil could be made 
in celebrating the event jewish families light an additional 
candle each night beginning with the first this friday evening 
until on the final evening the following friday eight candles 
shine from the menorah 
called the festival of lights it is not directly related to 
christmas but they have similar merry traditions of decorative 
lights games and giftgiving 
they also share that hanukkah gift that produced them both the 
perpetuation of religious rights

at this time last year katie kelly once an 
entertainment tonight movie critic was in ho chi minh city on 
vacation of all things spending christmas in a peaceful vietnam 
now shes spending christmas preparing to return as an english 
teacher for the kids the vietnam war left in the city then called 
saigon the amerasians born to vietnamese mothers and american 
servicemen 
the kids obviously have no father and in many cases no mother 
for a number of reasons kelly says its a heartbreaker when 
you see a whole bunch of them sleeping on the streets of saigon 
you see these little freckled noses and these little green 
eyes and the curly hair my god 
generally shunned by other vietnamese they are teenagers or 
young adults now the youngest would be 14 the war having ended in 
april 1975 
kelly who on dec 29 will quit her present job as a television 
critic here at nbcowned wnbctv met these children of war 
because as she jokes i take weird vacations im irish i dont 
go to the beach 
she sees the world instead this took her to vietnam last year 
most countries make her think she says this is nice ill visit 
again some day but vietnam was different it was my god ive 
got to get back here 
that attitude was prompted by running into these amerasian 
kids you start finding them in hue da nang but theyre all over 
the streets of saigon black and white i spent a couple of weeks 
there just hanging out with them 
and they are truly remarkable human beings and they suffer 
she learned of an operation set up for the children in ho chi 
minh city by a group of vietnam veterans in the united states 
based in wahiawia hawaii and run by a retired army master 
sergeant john rogers its called foundation for amerasian 
children emergency support she says 
the groups aim is to get these kids off the street get them 
food shelter some medical treatment she says 
the vietnamese government donated a house she says because 
the vietnamese government is interested in having the people learn 
english im a former schoolteacher so ill be tutoring these 
children in english 
the aim is not to ready the young people for when and if theyre 
allowed to emigrate to this country although her work would help 
that 
the main goal she says is to prepare the amerasians for when 
and if the united states and vietnam ever resume normal relations 
if that happens there will be americans over there and this 
would provide future job opportunities for these children 
kelly plans to leave in march she doesnt know how long shell 
stay it could be a year or the rest of her life 
its a far cry she says from growing up in tiny albion neb 
out there in corn country and even farther from being a tv or 
movie critic at wnbctv then wabctv here then entertainment 
tonight and then back at wnbc 
but the way she sees things its payback time 
im 53 years old she explains i consider myself the 
luckiest human being on the face of the earth ive had the best 
run of luck the last 10 years working in television 
ive made a good wage saved a good deal of money im very 
restless and its just time to cash in on my restlessness and 
maybe do some good its time to put a little of it back 
while not a victim of the bahhumbug disease that affects some 
at yuletide kelly feels uncomfortable this christmas in new york 
the reason her previous christmas in vietnam 
youre surrounded by christmas here and its so commercial 
she says people are spending all this money and i keep 
thinking 15 bucks would support one of these kids for a month 
a woman walked into the makeup room the other night with 100 
for gag presents that will be thrown away that would support a kid 
for six months

when william woys weaver picks up an old red 
clay stewpot or a wooden cookie press its the nicks and cracks 
that draw his practiced eye 
the form is what i look at first i like to pick up and see 
where it was used where the scratches are thats first and 
foremost if i can figure that out it makes me happy said 
weaver guest curator for the exhibit america eats forms of 
edible folk art at the museum of american folk art 
there are no styrofoam boxes microwaveready trays or juice 
boxes but there is a lovely rolling pin of whalebone and mahogany 
made by an american sailor around 1850 theres a batter jug 
decorated with blue swirls with two handles and a spout for 
pouring onto a griddle there is an eagleshaped cookie cutter and 
an intricate cider jelly mold many pots are glazed inside to 
withstand the acids of pickling or preserving 
america eats traces folk cookery mostly in the east 
through 135 objects from the 1600s to 1920s a book of the same 
name from harper amp row looks more deeply into cooking history and 
includes 42 recipes adapted to todays kitchens and ingredients 
the food is functional hearty simple foods that no longer 
serve a purpose are quickly forgotten weaver writes 
he celebrates the simple toast properly done was one of the 
unsung accomplishments of american folk cookery it was a culinary 
art form reduced by its very nature to the perfection of classic 
simplicity it represented a craftsmanship in folk cookery that has 
little to do with ornament 
an original recipe for maryland biscuits directs beat the 
dough with an ax for half an hour until the dough is soft or until 
it breaks when pulled the modern version still requires beating 
but with a rolling pin 
the exhibit inludes a wooden roller contraption called a break 
which cuts the beating time in half for either recipe 
little has been written about folk cooking so there are plenty 
of misconceptions such as the labeling of many old stewpots as 
chamber pots 
we always assumed people cooked everything in these old cast 
iron boilers but a lot was done in ceramics said weaver who is 
trained as an architect and found himself working increasingly on 
kitchens and food 
iron cookware came into vogue as cooks had to deal with the more 
intense heat of iron stoves 
more than any other single force the cookstove brought a 
radical change to the art of cookery weaver writes the rules 
that applied in the past the techniques and oral tradition that 
had been relied on for centuries were suddenly obsolete 
and toward the end of the 19th century the tin can made food 
available away from its source there was a mysterious virture a 
sense of impending progress once americans discovered that they 
could put folk culture into a can weaver writes 
folk art has enjoyed a new popularity today and folk cooking 
has benefited from that as well as from a heightened interest in 
food 
we are looking at the kitchen a lot today because there is an 
immense interest in cooking regional cuisines womens studies 
all of this has given it a respectability it hasnt had before 
weaver said 
many people he said are attracted by the sense of nostalgia 
others perhaps fed up with todays quick food are drawn by the 
craftsmanship 
things are so rootless today these are kind of touchstones 
it reminds people of their backgrounds their grandmothers 
greatgrandmothers giving the sense of connectedness that is a 
major theme of weavers book 
food plays an essential role in the search for connectedness he 
said 
if i moved away i could still make my pennsylvania dutch food 
in seattle or wherever its inside me like my spirit i dont 
think anything comes as close as food 
and connections are on several levels a folk cook is connected 
to the fuel and water supply aware how much effort it takes to 
keep water hot for washing said alice ross an expert in hearth 
cooking from long island the cook also is connected to the 
regional foods available to her to her family or community 
food also connected people to major events and weaver writes of 
funeral biscuits election day cakes and new years cakes as well 
as to the seasons and it connects people over time from indians 
using corn right down to popcorn and fritos theres a 
continuity weaver said 
there is a great interest in ethnicity ross said as 
things have disappeared more you get to the third and fourth 
generations of families they dont really want to have lost all 
thats been lost 
one reason folk cooking has been of interest to professionals 
only for the last 20 years or so was that it was womans work 
weaver and ross said 
it wasnt something that was professional it was in the 
home weaver said with one exception i found nothing that i 
could honestly say had been made by women for their own use i 
could not find any women tinsmiths or potters 
he included in his exhibit a basket made by black women in south 
carolina the only item made by blacks 
but while the nation was polarized over slavery many people 
refused to use ingredients produced by slave labor a boycott 
weaver noted not unlike modernday protests boycott recipes such 
as wisconsin cake made without molasses or sugar became part of 
the folk repertoire this kind of current is always there in 
food weaver said and its helpful to know why there was no 
molasses or sugar in that honey tea cake 
america eats forms of edible folk art runs through feb 4

a quick reality check on the 1990s 
it was the decade ted kennedy announced his clans goal for the 
21st century a million kennedys by the year 2050 
it was the decade raisa gorbachev kicked her husband out of 
office and capitalized the soviet union with the slogan lets go 
shopping 
it was the decade that bennie the retarded gofer on la 
law became chief justice of the us supreme court 
wasnt it 
tony hendra and peter elbling hope so the two 
satiriststurnedprophets have just published the 90s a look 
back a retrospective on the decade whose catchphrase was will 
be uh might be have a nice millennium 
in putting together the book one thing that emerged was a 
certain kind of attack on creeping niceness the feeling that 
everything is coming out all right hendra said in a telephone 
interview 
dan quayle will be running in 1996 and its the perfect slogan 
for him lets all have a nice millennium together said 
hendra a former editor of national lampoon who played the band 
manager in rob reiners rockumentary spoof this is spinal tap 
hendra and elbling gathered more than 75 writers and artists to 
produce their pseudohistory including author george plimpton 
comics bill murray and george carlin and playwright david mamet 
in their world things to come include social unrest by the 
secondhomeless middleincome americans who cant afford summer 
homes monster alkaseltzer tablets dropped into mountain lakes to 
solve the acid rain problem and a national weather service 
announcement that trailer parks cause tornadoes 
geraldo rivera is elected president and declares that his 
inauguration was my first public appearance in 10 years where no 
one took a swing at me 
the line between politics and show business became so blurred 
in the 80s elbling said in a telephone interview if reagan 
why not geraldo if a bmovie actor why not a bgrade talk show 
host 
marilyn quayle nearly derailed her husbands 1992 presidential 
campaign by posing nude the book includes a picture 
but i wish she had gone to the gym and worked out before she 
posed elbling said 
tasteless maybe the editors admit 
but no more tasteless than whats going on in the world 
said elbling who has worked with chicagos second city comedy club 
and appeared on nbcs cheers and the golden girls 
with satire youre almost bound to offend someone hendra said 
if you dont youre probably not doing a very good job its a 
sign youre doing the job right when the nitwits and hypocrites get 
exercised about something youve written 
the 90s is a sequel to their 1979 book the 80s a look 
back edited by hendra elbling and christopher cerf son of 
humorist bennett cerf elbling said cerfs schedule didnt allow 
him to work on the new book but he is listed in the credits as 
editor in absentia 
in 1979 the editors found they always had to explain what the 
title meant 
people asked if we meant the 80s age group or the 1880s 
said hendra americans werent conscious of the 1980s as an 
entity he said 
with the 90s book they havent had to explain the title at all 
decadethink has become part of the national 
consciousness he said even the lowest form of intelligence 
airline magazines are doing stories about the 90s 
published by avon books the book uses issues of the late 80s 
to extrapolate the future in response to president bushs call for 
a kinder gentler nation america introduced the lowvoltage 
electric chair in 1994 the issue of dumping medical waste at sea 
came to a climax when an entire operating room complete with 
comatose patient washed ashore in new jersey the disease of the 
90s was chips computer human infectious parasitic syndrome the 
transfer of computer viruses to the human nervous system 
and the economic war with asia took a twist when the cia 
recommended that japan vaporize two american cities with small 
atomic bombs in august 1995 to stimulate new us economic growth 
the japanese refused saying they had no nuclear bombs 
if you can say that some frightful thing has already happened 
you do it with the hope that people will laugh and then not let it 
happen hendra said 
hendra and elbling talk as if theyre really living in the year 
historys odometer clicked around to three zeros they consider the 
90s a done deal with their book standing as the decades 
definitive history 
we feel as if weve lived through the 90s and we feel an 
obligation to share our insights elbling said 
hendra and elbling kill off a good share of todays public 
figures queen elizabeth is beheaded by margaret thatcher lauren 
bacall rex reed and other dakota apartment dwellers are murdered 
by yoko ono so she can buy their coops and dan quayle 
mysteriously ascends into heaven during a ski trip 
disposable people make good jokes says the books 
introduction 
in fairness the book also brings back some of historys dead 
we know nostradamus predictions that the dead would rise from 
their graves as the millennium approached were true and we have 
nostradamus himself to prove it 
the decade ends with a public suicide by donald trump who has 
become a trillionaire recluse with shoulderlength hair and gnarled 
finger nails a shot literally heard round the world 
i think dons much too busy ransacking parts of the globe to 
take much offense at anything we might write about him elbling 
said 
some predictions in the book already are coming true in 
principle if not in fact 
the 90s predicts the berlin wall will be torn down in the 
book though the wall is moved to central park to separate blacks 
from whites in another divided city new york 
and eastern europes shift away from communism is 
wellrepresented after seizing power raisa gorbachev proclaims 
a softer fluffier soviet nation as a brigade of washerdryer 
combinations rolls by in the first maytag day parade 
the three zeroes in the year 2000 could be the key to 
understanding the decade elbling said the noughts could signify 
the start of the third millennium or they could be read as 
ohohoh exclamations signaling the end of the world 
nobody knows if well even be here in 10 years he said 
everything could come to a crashing halt or a crashing bang that 
ohohoh kind of sums it up 
hendra said those ohs are a problem for the book he wants to 
do 10 years from now 
what do you call a book for the year 2000 the ohohs a look 
back he said ill cross that millennium when i come to it

for thousands in the area devastated by 
hurricane hugo the traditional southern christmas day feast will 
come in a cardboard box donated by the salvation army so much has 
been lost by so many and yet the spirit of the season shines 
through 
its there in christmas lights twinkling for the first time in 
charlestons historic district its there in acts of kindness 
small and large 
i wanted to do something to help this seemed the best thing 
to do ray cook said as he helped wire a new house in mount 
pleasant for elizabeth edwards who lost her home to hugos 135 mph 
winds 
cook who lives in aiken and a friend bruce mclauchlin of 
hopewell va spent a week of this month helping build the 
832squarefoot house both the home and their labor were donated 
the new house is the best thing thats happened in my whole 
life said mrs edwards who hopes to move in with her niece and 
her nieces daughter by christmas 
meanwhile donated toys are pouring into the state from across 
the nation to provide a brighter christmas for other families hit 
hard by the storm 
at least 30000 toys have been contributed and social service 
officials say the total should climb much higher as christmas nears 
five days before christmas the toys for tots campaign in 
charleston had received 18000 toys 10000 more than it 
distributed last year and hundreds more were expected said staff 
sgt ozell register chairman of the marine reservesponsored 
effort 
another collection effort was launched by a beaufort couple bud 
and evelyn culbertson after their 6yearold daughter leea 
started crying when she saw pictures of hugos devastation 
she was concerned about the kids she wanted to give away all 
of her toys culbertson said 
the family has collected about 15000 toys since late september 
he said 
meanwhile theres still a keen demand for food furniture 
blankets and kerosene heaters among storm victims three months 
after hugo slammed into south carolina at charleston on sept 21 
said capt jim worthy the salvation army commander for charleston 
the storm left 29 dead in south carolina and 6 billion in 
damage 
last christmas the salvation army donated about 1600 christmas 
baskets containing food for a family of four for a week this year 
about 4500 will be distributed but worthy said the demand will 
continue long after christmas 
we have adequate food right now were getting a lot of 
christmas help traditionally after christmas it will stop and 
thats when the real crunch will come he said 
in charleston christmas lights have blossomed in places they 
were never seen before on the palmettos along broad street and 
lining the old citadel building on calhoun square making the 
structure look like a fairy tale castle 
we decided to do everything possible to show christmas said 
howard chapman coordinator of the citys relief effort i think 
people appreciate that it gives them something to look forward to 
and the children the hope the community is coming back 
part of the display is the 89foot norway spruce which dominates 
king street strung with a mile of lights the tree is believed to 
be among the largest christmas trees in the nation 
this is a very special christmas for all of us in our 
community mayor joseph p riley jr told thousands who turned 
out for the tree lighting our community has shown we have the 
christmas spirit i saw people who lost their homes who were 
concerned about their fellow man this year we have so much thanks 
so much to be thankful for 
while the displays are helping weekend shopping business 
theres concern that seasonal business is lagging because of a 
misconception that downtown buildings were gutted by the storm 
kris holmes of the market area merchants association said the 
associations 250 members are taking out ads in addition to 
regular holiday advertising to dispel that misconception 
meanwhile business at suburban shopping centers is brisk 
sales are up from last year said shirley webb assistant 
manager of the childrens palace store in west ashley 
my personal opinion is its because of the hurricane she 
said customers are making up for some of the inconveniences 
especially for the children and theyre going to make this 
christmas better than before

like other mothers fifi reed cant give her 
son everything he wants for christmas she got 9yearold tarek his 
favorite transformer robots but his fondest wish is not to be 
she cant bring his father home 
christmas was very special for my husband said mrs reed 
this will be the fourth christmas in captivity for frank reed one 
of the eight american hostages in lebanon 
he would start getting things ready a month ahead of time 
hed have the christmas carols on every day and plan on who were 
going to invite he would cook the turkey himself 
for mrs reed a syrian national and tarek it is their first 
christmas in america far from friends and from husband and father 
i miss him a lot said tarek who uses the present tense 
when relating memories of his father 
he usually sees me when i play with the turtles said tarek 
referring to his pets we usually walk on the grass and talk 
reed the american director of the lebanese international 
school was kidnapped sept 9 1986 tarek wasnt quite 6 then 
now the boy and his mother plead the case of the hostages 
wherever they can from the glenwood school where tarek is in the 
third grade to university halls to the white house 
dear mr bush please free my father he began a letter to 
the president he signed it your friend tarek reed his 
classmates wore yellow ribbons and wrote similar letters to 
president bush but there has been no reply tarek brought in a 
9by12inch photo of his father and showed it to his classmates 
that was touching said his teacher trudy laspina he was 
very proud he was pleased with what we were doing 
these are the two faces of tarek a boy propelled far beyond his 
age trying to face the realities of the civil war in lebanon the 
last time when the bombings started everyone thought it was 
thunder he said a kid in his natural world of fantasy where 
toy dinosaurs and robots are the good guys he often talks about in 
the games he plays 
during a religious ceremony he placed a photo of his father 
beneath a tree of freedom a christmas tree decorated in memory 
of the eight american hostages in the next instant while a 
private mass was being said for the hostages in a home tarek was 
in the next room drawing in a coloring book with 7yearold 
michael his newfound friend 
if anything tarek is doing better than his mother in these 
painful times he walks to school alone something that would have 
been unheard of in beirut recently he went around the neighborhood

easily everything is so different the customs the habits 
mrs reed said she is not alive she is only existing people 
tend to think youre fine youre just as happy as other people

happy but deep inside youre not that happy you want your husband 
around and you want the comfort of a family 
mrs reed and tarek came here last summer on vacation but they 
stayed when fighting intensified in beirut and it appeared the

getting close and there are days when its just getting out of 
hand its getting impossible aw come on come on come on what 
is going on lets do something 
im angry who gave them the captors the right to do this 
wheres the justice by what right can the people take somebodys 
life and decide theyre going to put them in jail why 
in the midst of these thoughts she had asked herself how 
much more can i take 
jeanpaul kauffmann a french journalist who was released by 
proiranian shiite moslem captors in may 1988 told her about the 
treatment of the hostages and she said it just blew my mind 
theyd be blindfolded most of the time theyd be shoved the 
food in a dirty dish under the door a lot of times if they caught 
them talking to each other they would beat them

retaining being there three years i dont know is the person 
going to come out normal frank is not young hes 56 
the thoughts that race through her mind are not all haunting 
there are the good memories of how they met and married in 1977 
when she was in training as a teacher at the international school 
and they were the best of times as the couple faced together the 
objections of her parents because he was american and protestant 
and she was syrian and moslem he later converted to her religion 
we had to try to convince them we wanted to get married we 
were just the right people for each other this is the time i 
remember we just had a great time together i used to say its 
too nice to be true and it was too nice to be true it ended all 
of a sudden

outwardly its been christmas as usual shops filled trees 
flocked lights strung but for many people in places scarred by 
disaster this has not been an ordinary holiday season 
this christmas will be more deeply felt and longer remembered by 
those who were touched by the northern california earthquake the 
alaska oil spill and the tornado that killed nine schoolchildren 
near newburgh ny 
in san francisco the rev cecil williams of glide memorial 
methodist church said this holiday season presents special 
challenges to those who suffered losses in the october earthquake 
no one should be homeless on christmas eve and christmas 
day he said and weve decided anyone who needs a place were 
going to put them up 
glide has been raising money to pay for rooms at local 
residential hotels to house up to 1000 people the church also 
planned to hand out more than 9500 bags of groceries and 5000 
toys and feed more than 6000 people on both christmas eve and 
christmas day 
some bay area charities complained that the surge of giving 
after the quake has subsided even while the need remains strong 
at the volunteer bureau of santa cruz county spokeswoman maria 
norena said collections have been meager for new clothing and toys 
and she said this year we need it more than ever 
in alaskas port city of valdez site of the nations worst oil 
spill last march a dreary rainy summer has given way to a dreary 
slushy winter 
the communitys population ballooned to about 13000 people from 
its normal 3000 during the summers cleanup frenzy this winter 
the number has shrunk to about 4000 
i think theres kind of a letdown after a busy summer said 
city manager doug griffin i dont think that is necessarily bad 
i think after all the activity people need to catch their breath 
city councilman dennis holtz who owns the food mart said his 
sales have been strong but im sensing the community is not 
upbeat he added i think people are tired from the long 
summer and the spirit the christmas spirit is not present i 
just think everybodys beat

people are beginning to put the tragedy at east coldenham 
elementary school behind them although we all realize its going 
to be with us a long time 
for a lot of the families involved and others in the 
community its going to take a lot of the edge and joy off of 
christmastime bechtel said but kids get caught up in the 
season and the time of year and are generally doing well 
one of those killed 8yearold peter orsino had attended 
sunday school at bechtels church 
peters family is handling it pretty well bechtel said 
they have other children and theyre trying to celebrate a normal 
christmas but i know another family they dont want to decorate

democratic changes sweeping across eastern europe are making it 
easier to practice religion but church officials foresee a new set 
of challenges in the suddenly more open religious marketplace 
the new market for destructive religious cults will be eastern 
europe said rabbi a james rudin interreligious affairs 
director of the american jewish committee this will be an area 
of people who are in a sense almost innocent to the claims of 
cults 
and in the land where martin luther nailed his 95 theses to a 
church door in wittenberg in defiance of roman catholic authorities 
in 1517 starting the german reformation church members are 
demanding new freedoms including the right to participate in the 
churchs decisionmaking 
people are asking if the new thinking and openness is valid in 
society is it not valid for church structures said the rev 
david nelson viennabased secretary for europe of the evangelical 
lutheran church in america 
the new freedoms from open borders to reduced restrictions on 
worship and church membership were fought for by most of the 
churches themselves and are generally welcomed 
last week government officials in czechoslovakia said they were 
drafting laws to ensure freedom of religion soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev who met with pope john paul ii this month has 
pledged a new law guaranteeing freedom of worship and steps have 
already been taken to clear the way for legalizing the banned 
ukrainian catholic church 
church members who once faced restrictions ranging from the loss 
of coveted civil jobs to imprisonment are eager for the laws to 
change according to western observers 
there certainly is an opinion that the changes now under way 
in eastern europe are very favorable to the work of the christian 
church said nelson 
but with the new opportunities us experts say come a host of 
new challenges particularly in nations where the majority 
religious group enjoyed a special status as the only independent 
institution 
in a paradox the lutheran church in east germany and elsewhere 
found that being stripped of its power over the last 40 years freed 
the church to focus on its mission of being an advocate for the 
powerless said the rev steven boehme who spent 2 years in east 
germany for the national council of churches 
in their weakness was indeed their strength and further from 
the seat of power is closer to the heart of things said boehme 
of the christian church disciples of christ who returned home 
oct 30 
the church will have to reflect on what it has learned in the 
last 40 years 
he said he hopes the church under the new freedoms welcomes more 
plurality within its ranks and becomes the voice of those left 
behind during any hardships that result from economic reforms 
nelson said clergy and laypeople who have quietly accepted the 
actions of church leaders over the decades are beginning to 
scrutinize church hierarchy more particularly church officials who 
were viewed as collaborators with the old regimes 
in that way they are starting to catch up with decades of 
theological changes in the west giving greater authority to lay 
members of congregations 
but gerard powers an adviser on eastern europe in the office of 
international justice and peace of the us catholic conference 
said many churches in eastern europe have had to rely on preworld 
war ii theological texts and are not uptodate on even major 
changes such as the second vatican council in the early 1960s 
in general theres no doubt because of the restrictions on 
the catholic church in eastern europe and other churches one 
effect of that is the church has not kept up with changes in the 
universal church powers said 
rabbi rudin expressed concern about residual antisemitism 
he cited the controversy in poland over delays in the promised 
removal of a carmelite convent from the edge of the auschwitz death 
camp and derisive remarks by east german and hungarian leaders 
about the jewish media and rootless cosmopolitans which he 
called old code words for antisemitism 
as we move to a global village religious commmunities will 
have to live and work together in ways we have not done before 
said rudin who was in poland in the fall organizing conferences 
between catholic and american jewish leaders 
still us observers look ahead hopefully as change unfolds in 
eastern europe 
religious freedom can only benefit all the churches there 
said powers and we should celebrate it

withstanding parodies and putdowns president 
bushs thousand points of light have flickered from a cryptic 
campaign slogan into a federal program to foster the volunteer 
spirit in america 
not bad given that bush himself once confessed he wasnt really 
certain what the phrase meant much as he liked the lilt of the 
words 
so there are a thousand points of light at least there are 
supposed to be glittering from the national christmas tree on the 
ellipse behind the white house and the presidents pointoflight 
lieutenant has been issuing citations recognizing daily points of 
light individuals and organizations engaged in community service 
to help solve social problems 
we will single out the few because they represent the many 
bush said we hope that by highlighting their achievements and 
the ways theyve found to serve we can inspire others to serve 
and yes there is a pointoflight man at the white house c 
gregg petersmeyer a denver businessman who worked in the bush 
campaign is director of the office of national service his 
assignment is to mobilize the campaign for volunteer efforts the 
administration will be seeking congressional backing for a points 
of light initiative foundation to manage a nationwide drive to 
enlist people in community service 
the government already has programs to organize volunteer 
efforts among them vista action and the older american volunteer 
program congress approved an extension of those programs through 
1993 just before adjourning this year 
bush is expected to ask congress to provide 25 million in each 
of the next four years to help finance the foundation with 
matching amounts to be sought from private donors the goal 
according to petersmeyer will be to encourage every citizen to get 
involved in at least one community service activity every business 
also will be asked to join the effort to mobilize volunteers to 
cope with hunger homelessness drug abuse juvenile crime and 
other social ills 
the president appointed an advisory committee headed by retiring 
gov thomas kean of new jersey to plan the foundation and work on 
the legislation to create it at its first meeting petersmeyer 
told the five members that power is flowing from the government to 
the people with the effort to promote volunteerism 
the panel is to meet again next month to deliver its final 
report to bush 
so far as least the points of light do not seem to have 
multiplied despite the presidents emphasis on volunteer efforts 
a gallup poll conducted six weeks ago showed no measurable increase 
in charitable or social service activities during the past two 
years 
according to that survey 41 percent of americans say they are 
involved in volunteer work two years ago it was 39 percent the 
numbers go up sharply when the question is of charitable 
contributions rather than volunteer work more than 70 percent said 
they had made donations to charity in the past year 
the phrase that has become the bush theme on voluntary efforts 
dates from his speech to the republican national convention in 
1988 bush ticked off names of 10 organizations from the grange to 
the business and professional women of america and called them all 
elements in a brilliant diversity spread like stars like a 
thousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky 
i will keep america moving forward always forward for a 
better america for an endless enduring dream and a thousand points 
of light he said as he concluded 
speechwriter peggy noonan is credited with writing the line 
bush grabbed it and ran although he tripped now and then as he 
repeated the refrain during the campaign he spoke of a thousand 
points of life and of a thousand shining hills and at 
first he acknowledged that he couldnt define exactly what it 
meant 
but eventually practice made perfect 
when gov michael dukakis complained in a campaign debate that 
i dont know what that means bush said that was typical of 
bigspending liberals who think the government should do 
everything he said he was talking about the enormous number of 
people and organizations willing to help others 
it was part of his inaugural address a thousand points of 
light all the community organizations that are spread like 
stars throughout the nation doing good 
now it is part of his administration

at first the woman couldnt remember if the 
suspiciouslooking man she saw near the murder scene wore any 
jewelry 
but a few minutes later as she concentrated on her recollection 
of him turning his head to the side she remembered a gold earring 
that memory helped solve the case says psychologist ronald 
fisher who interviewed her at the request of police the payoff 
came from an experimental technique called the cognitive interview 
aimed at getting crime victims and witnesses to remember more than 
under standard police questioning 
the technique is one of several contributions psychology 
researchers hope will help solve crimes and convict criminals 
much of this work has been done only in laboratories but the 
cognitive interview recently showed promise in a realworld test 
with detectives at the metrodade police department in miami 
it proved to be real fruitful said police sgt jim wander 
the guys who took part in it are appreciative of the results and 
i think theyre probably better detectives overall as a result of 
it 
results were reported in the october issue of the journal of 
applied psychology by fisher and michael amador of florida 
international university and r edward geiselman of the university 
of california los angeles 
by analyzing interviews with robbery victims and witnesses they 
found that seven detectives trained in the technique elicited 47 
percent more information than before training and 63 percent more 
than did nine untrained detectives 
the technique involves asking fewer questions than a standard 
interview putting more burden on the witness to actively generate 
information rather than simply respond to queries fisher said 
among its strategies is to discern the witness job or hobby 
interests which might indicate details he is more likely to 
recall a clothing designer might be able to describe in detail 
what a suspect was wearing for example 
the witness is also asked to recall his emotions and thoughts at 
the time of the crime because studies suggest that will help 
recollectionthat can be tricky in the case of a victim who was 
frightened by the crime fisher said 
the interviewer also asks the witness what happened not so much 
to get information as to determine the witness vantage point in 
seeing the crime and the mental pictures he has of it the meat 
of the interview lies in asking the witness to recall the event 
one mental picture at a time and probe each picture for detail as 
it unfolds 
for example if a suspect initially approached the witness and 
then walked away the witness should be asked about the suspects 
face only while recalling the approach questions about the back of 
the suspects jacket should wait until the witness has moved on to 
recalling the departure 
the technique has a lot of promise said gary wells 
chairman of the psychology department at iowa state university and 
the author of a handbook on eyewitness identification for police 
but he and elizabeth loftus of the university of washington have 
some reservations for example the interview combines several 
techniques and it is not clear which produces the results finding 
that out might help researchers determine when to use the interview 
and when not to wells said 
loftus also questioned whether the extra details recalled during 
the cognitive interview are important some of them are 
important some of them are not replied fisher i go for all 
the information i can get 
wells said more tests of the technique are needed 
another line of memory research deals with the risk that a 
victim or witness will falsely identify an innocent person several 
hundred people a year may be falsely convicted of felonies in the 
united states through erroneous identification said ken 
deffenbacher a psychology professor at the university of nebraska 
at omaha 
laboratory experiments have shown two strategies useful in 
reducing the risk of false identifications in police lineups wells 
said lineups include a person suspected by police and several 
people who generally resemble him 
in one strategy wells studied the witness is shown a blank 
lineup which unknown to him does not contain any suspects if he 
fingers somebody he is discarded as unreliable 
in the other strategy the witness is shown one person at a time 
and asked if it is the right person in the laboratory this 
technique reduced false identifications by 20 percent to nearly 40 
percent wells said 
but lt ron lewis of the robberyhomicide division of the los 
angeles police department said he considered the blank lineup 
unnecessary because a regular lineup can already expose an 
erroneous witness if the witness fails to choose the suspect he 
also said the district attorney generally will not file a complaint 
against a person identified by only one witness corroborating 
evidence or multiple witness identifications are generally needed 
on another aspect of eyewitness reliability studies show that 
people do more poorly in identifying people of a different race 
than of their own said florida state university psychologist john 
brigham his recent analysis of 14 studies involving blacks and 
whites found the problem affected each race about equally a lot 
of people had assumed that whites would do worse with blacks than 
blacks would do with whites brigham said 
the reason for the problem is not clear the observers degree 
of racial prejudice doesnt seem to make a consistent difference 
and evidence suggesting the cause is lack of exposure to people of 
a different race is pretty weak he said maybe scientists need 
a better measure of exposure including types of exposure to 
demonstrate such a relationship he said 
brigham suggested that in appropriate cases jurors be told of 
the hazards of crossracial identification he also recommended 
that lineups be arranged by an officer who is the same race as the 
suspect and may be better able to choose people who resemble the 
suspect providing a fairer test of the identification police 
departments do not appear to do that generally now he said 
gerald arenberg executive director of the national association 
of chiefs of police said he doubts such a practice would be widely 
used because of the logistics of having enough officers of the 
proper race available 
wells said that when he describes his lineup techniques and the 
cognitive interview while giving workshops to police they are 
quite impressed with the kinds of findings that were coming up 
with 
i really think this is one of the areas of applied psychology 
that is making a real contribution and a real difference

in the spirit of christmas 8yearold 
carly bores is giving a gift that may mean a longer life for other 
children with cancer 
carly a blueeyed redhaired secondgrader has cancer of the 
lymph system she volunteered through marshfield clinic for an 
international study to test new treatments for cancers in children 
and infants 
when doctors discussed with mike and laura bores their 
daughters hodgkins disease it convinced them to let carly take 
part in the study 
all they can tell us is she has an 85 percent chance of being 
diseasefree for two years mrs bores said they cant say 10 
years or 20 years or a lifetime because they dont have those kinds 
of records 
the more information they can gather from more people the 
easier it will be to tell parents things like that in the future 
carlys ordeal also has changed the meaning of christmas for the 
family 
this christmas the kids will be seeing less under the tree 
and more of me i need to give more of myself mrs bores said 
sitting in a special home on the clinic campus where parents and 
children can live while a child receives radiation treatment the 
familys medical bills total 30000 most of wich has been covered 
by insurance 
the childrens cancer study group headquartered at the 
university of southern california school of medicine in pasadena 
enrolls 6000 patients each year and has 25000 in longterm 
research said dr john weiner administrative director more than 
100 hospitals including 32 major medical centers take par in 
ccsg which was founded in 1955 
all treatments are assigned by the national headquarters which 
also monitors patient progess and evaluates the effectiveness of 
new treatments weiner said adding that the research has led to 
dramatic progress in finding a cure for childhood cancers in 1972 
30 percent of youths with lymphatic cancers lived more two years 
the survival rate is now 80 percent 
if we had the perfect treatment in hand today we wouldnt 
stop these clinical trials for another 10 years he said 
the risk to patients is low weiner said they either receive an 
established treatment with proven results or they may get a better 
treatment with the new drug or therapy being studied 
carly found out in may she had hodgkins disease doctors dont 
know what caused it other than a cell decided to divide wrong 
said mrs bores who with her husband mike owns an outdoors 
sports store in three lakes 
the couple have one other child 10yearold aaron 
after 12 drug treatments carly started radiation therapy in 
early december for the next two years she will undergo monthly 
xrays and blood tests to make sure the cancer is destroyed 
because her spleen was removed she also must take penicillin every 
day for the rest of her life 
usually if a second cancer occurs it is within the first two 
years the longer you go past that twoyear mark the better your 
prognosis is said mrs bores adding that the shock of finding 
out her child had cancer has made her more patient more flexible 
and probably kinder this holiday season i feel so fortunate that 
i can take carly and hug her and love her 
as for carly she says the most difficult part of her ordeal was 
the surgery when a catheter was installed for chemotherapy she 
knows how serious the disease is because a friend died of hodgkins 
disease two years ago 
but this is christmastime and shes been getting ready as 
though her life hasnt changed at all theres been cookies to 
bake shopping to do and the excitement of hoping she may get more 
coins for her collection 
its the same as last year she said christmas is 
christmas

beneath the surface of lake pend oreille 
scientists are testing technology the navy hopes will make the new 
seawolf class attack submarines the worlds fastest and quietest 
general dynamics corp last month laid the keel for the first of 
the 14 billion ssn21 submarines at its groton conn shipyard 
said navy spokesman lt greg smith asked about specifics of the 
work here of the acoustic research detachment he said nearly 
all that information is classified 
the civilian contractor tracor inc of austin texas tests 
onefifth and onequarter scale models of hulls and propellers 
here in general researchers want to know how much noise is made 
by the special steel hull as water flows past and how much the 
steel dampens noise made by machinery inside said george a 
guedel the civilian manager 
we are trying to develop technologies for allowing the 
submarine to go faster quieter and still hear others before they 
hear it guedel said 
a key piece of equipment is the 64 million kokanee a 
quarterscale model steered by computer as it sails through an 
underwater course the model is used to test propeller designs 
intended to reduce noise said jim scott a spokesman for the david 
taylor research center at annapolis and carderock md 
the acoustic research detachment at bayview is a unit of the 
david taylor center and is one of six such laboratories for ship 
research 
the base is designated classified the lowest of three levels of 
security unarmed guards from a private security company patrol the 
grounds signs posted on fences and buoys in the lake tell people 
not to trespass 
bayview a quiet fishing resort community of about 237 fulltime 
residents surrounds the 22acre base which is behind a chain link 
fence with concertina wire otherwise there is not much to 
indicate that the collection of aluminum buildings is a center of 
classified research 
inside a metal drydock its ceiling covered with insulation to 
prevent snooping by soviet infrared satellites modifications are 
made to the kokanee and other test models named for northwest fish 
species although the kokanee is inside the building its aft and 
propeller are always covered by a shroud 
in the middle of the bay a large floating metal building is 
used to refit hull designs and conduct noise experiments on a 
110ton fullscale model 
in one series of tests buoyant hulls called vertical flying 
models are pulled to the bottom of the 1300footdeep lake then 
released as they rise to the surface technicians using 
computerassisted listening devices learn how much noise they make 
as they cruise through the water 
there are several reasons why the glaciercarved lake is in some 
ways better than seawater for testing the acoustic properties of 
various metals and equipment guedel said in the middle of the 
lake there are 23 square miles of water 1000 feet deep or more 
the subsurface temperature stays a chilly 395 degrees yearround 
and there is less corrosion than in saltwater tests

babies of depressed women cry more and are 
less responsive to their mothers who in turn are less 
affectionate less sensitive and less attached to their babies a 
psychological researcher says 
about 26 percent of american women experience a major depression 
some time during their lives and depression seems to be hitting 
earlier when the likely have small children said university of 
utah psychologist donna m gelfand 
gelfands findings compared 41 depressed mothers who had 3 to 
12monthold babies with 40 nondepressed mothers the depressed 
women were referred by area clinics and therapists nondepressed 
women were chosen from a birth registry 
researchers who werent informed which women were depressed made 
three home visits to each asking questions and observing 
interactions with their babies 
the depressed women were less attached to their babies less 
affectionate and less sensitive to babies needs gelfand said 
they also gave conflicting emotional messages more and gave their 
babies lower ratings than did the nondepressed group for being 
lively and alert in one extreme case a mother was so inattentive 
she didnt notice her baby had fallen off her lap depressed 
mothers lacked confidence in their own effectiveness as parents 
depressed mothers tended to issue strict prohibitions instead of 
showing or telling the child what to do she said this baffles 
children who cant make sense of it and makes their environment 
seem capricious the child may respond by being fussy and resisting 
parents directives the childs responses add to the womans 
feeling that shes not a good mother 
in the second phase of the research public health nurses are 
visiting the mothers weekly for six months to demonstrate methods 
of care and discipline answer questions and provide social support

the grass isnt greener over bill 
wolvertons septic tank he doesnt have one nor is his home 
hooked to a seage treatment system 
wolvertons household sewage flows through 50 feet of pipes 
reservoirs and plants along the outside wall of a 1500squarefoot 
addition the plants grown along large windows eat the organic 
wastes leaving pure clean water 
i wanted to put it in just to show that it can be done and 
this is what will be done on the moon base if nasa ever builds a 
moon base the retired national aeronautics and space 
administration scientist said 
wolvertons system uses a variation of the artificial marsh 
he developed a decade ago plants are supported on clay rocks 
imported from germany above reservoirs of wastewater the end roots 
of the plants reach into the wastewater for nutrients and thrive 
without fertilizer or watering the bug problem was corrected by 
introducing a few chameleons to the indoor system 
wolvertons artificial marsh in large outdoor versions is used 
by several small towns in mississippi and louisiana the system is 
relatively simple to install and once operating presents little 
or no maintenance costs 
i think philosophically that this sort of system would come 
closer to meeting the goals of the clean water act than some of the 
mechanical systems said barry royals of the state bureau of 
pollution control the problem is that a wetlands system is not 
the answer to everybodys problem 
an example of that would be if you tried to build a wetlands 
system for the city of jackson you would take up a good portion of 
hinds county and we know thats not practical

and in austin and san antonio texas the company said wednesday 
william jovanovich 69 remains as chairman of the board of hbj

jeopardy since last summer when hbj announced plans to sell its 
six theme parks the company also said at the time that it would 
allow caulo to leave his post to manage the parks

sentinel that anheuserbusch cos inc which bought the parks in

and agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
however they added in a joint statement wednesday certain 
aspects of the eec proposal cannot be accepted by the united states 
the comprehensive eec proposal was made in geneva in the uruguay 
round of trade talks under the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade the gatt negotiations are scheduled to conclude at the end 
of 1990 
while the proposal contains some positive indications we are 
concerned with the continued reliance by the eec on managed 
agriculture and in particular the apparent intention to continue 
to rely upon largescale subsidies and especially export 
subsidies the leaders said 
government programs that manage markets are one of the major 
causes of the current trade distortions in agriculture they 
said the successful future of trade in agriculture depends on 
market liberalization and significant reduction of subsidies that 
distort trade 
the united states cannot accept the eec proposal to 
rebalance import protection mrs hills and yeutter said 
rebalancing would raise tariffs reduce market access and 
increase the price of food to consumers they said rebalancing 
is simply protectionism by another name and we believe the other 
gatt countries will recognize it as such 
mrs hills and yeutter said the eec approach does little to 
liberalize market access and that the 12nation blocs position 
on export subsidies is unacceptably weak and totally out of 
step with other proposals made in the talks

south korea has chosen the fa18 
hornet produced by mcdonnell douglas corp as its main jet fighter 
a decision worth an estimated 44 billion to the us defense 
contractor 
the hornet won out over another us competitor general 
dynamics corps f16 falcon after a lengthy contest 
the announcement wednesday came as a surprise widespread 
reports said the nod would go to the far less expensive f16 south 
korea already has dozens of f16s in the early 1980s it 
purchased 36 of them 
mcdonnell douglas based in st louis said in a statement 
released in seoul the korean decision reaffirms americas 
worldwide leadership in the aerospace industry 
it estimated the contract would mean more than 20 million man 
hours of labor for us workers and 3 billion worth of exports 
over the next eight years 
defense minister lee sanghoon told a news conference we have 
chosen the fa18s after considering all factors including safety 
national interest and operational advantage that can help us to 
effectively cope with north koreas fast developing air 
capability 
the announcement gave no price tag for the project but industry 
officials estimated it was worth at least 44 billion they said 
the same number of falcons would have cost 28 billion 
the deal calls for south korea to buy or coproduce 120 fa18s 
under its fighter program from 199298 korea plans to buy 12 
finished fa18s assemble 36 from ussupplied kits and 
coproduce 72 in korean factories with the help of its us 
contractor 
the hornet is a singleseat twinengine jet first produced in 
1978 it is used by 30 squadrons in the us navy and marine corps 
and 842 planes have been sold to canada australia spain kuwait 
and switzerland 
its standard combat arms include two heatseeking sidewinder 
missiles on the wingtips two radarguided advanced sparrow 
missiles on fuselage stations and an internally mounted 20mm 
machine gun with 570 rounds of ammunition 
the cockpit is entirely digital with three color monitors and a 
new navigational and radar system for night attacks 
some civilian officials supported choosing the cheaper f16 but 
the air force preferred the fa18s which it believes can 
technically match north koreas newly introduced sovietmade 
mig29s and su25s government sources said speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
defense ministry spokesman brig gen kim jiwook said mcdonnell 
douglas offered a better deal including a promise to 
electronically upgrade aging phantom jet fighters now in operation 
industry officials expressed hope the plane purchase would help 
develop south koreas civilian aerospace industry samsung 
aerospace industries an arm of the giant samsung group will be 
the main korean contractor for the military deal and companies in 
the daewoo and hanjin groups will participate 
under american law the us congress will have 50 days to 
approve or reject the sale from the time it is formally notified of 
the agreement 
the us government under congressional pressure had asked 
south korea to purchase more finished aircraft to help reduce south 
koreas trade surplus with the united states expected to reach 
45 billion in 1989 
south korea bowing to us pressure also had to lower from 50 
percent to 30 percent the portion of the socalled offset program 
under which the us contractor would buy koreanmade aircraft 
parts in return for selling the american aircraft 
some us legislators expressed concern over technology transfer 
to a nation which can develop its own aviation industry to compete 
with american firms 
mcdonnell douglas officials in seoul said south korean air force 
people visited the united states twice this year to try out the 
airplane once for six weeks the company shipped more than a ton 
of paper evaluations on the plane to seoul in september 
they said delivery of the first planes will depend on how 
quickly congress approves the contract 
the fa18 was approved for overseas sales 3 years ago and is 
the top us military plane that can be offered for sale to foreign 
nations

the senate banking committee has defended the 
independence of the federal reserve board and praised the central 
banks inflationfighting program 
a suitable degree of independence for the federal reserve is 
essential the committee said wednesday in a report to vice 
president dan quayle adding the feds current structure 
appropriately provides some insulation from political pressures 
reviewing the feds attempt to curtail inflation by slowing 
economic growth just short of a recession the committee said 
this policy has been reasonably successful 
it also said the feds plan to depress growth slightly next year 
in order to achieve modest reductions in inflation does not 
appear unreasonable 
the report comes after several attacks on the feds 
independence from bush administration officials and members of the 
house 
president bush and members of his cabinet have criticized the 
central bank for what they call its excessive concern with 
inflation and dampening growth too much housing secretary jack 
kemp has said the administration and congress should have more 
influence over the fed 
he is backed by the chairman of the joint economic committee 
rep lee hamilton dind who introduced legislation earlier this 
year which would force the fed to operate more openly and consult 
more closely with the administration 
earlier this month house banking committee chairman henry b 
gonzalez dtexas said he would launch a major review of the fed 
next year 
the senate panels report was signed by its chairman sen 
donald w riegle jr dmich only one of the panels 20 members 
dissented sen james sasser dtenn who is chairman of the 
budget committee 
sasser in a written addition to the report said the fed which 
has eased its tight money policy since june has been not nearly 
aggressive enough in allowing interest rates to decline 
i think that there is increasing evidence that we may be 
sliding into a recession if this is so it will be the result of 
the feds tightening he said

the wampanoag indians of gay head mass have 
dropped a bid to run a cape cod cellular phone service in exchange 
for millions of dollars in a settlement with a competing 
telephone company 
nynex mobile communications a subsidiary of nynex corp agreed 
to the settlement wednesday which clears an obstacle for it to run 
a cellular phone servce on the cape 
the tribal president said the money will go toward other 
economic development programs for the wampanoags possibly 
including a resort complex on marthas vineyard island 
we both got what we wanted actually said donald widdiss 
president of the wampanoag tribal council of gay head inc we 
feel we can leverage the money we have to go into other ventures 
those include setting up a museum and cultural center in gay 
head a town on marthas vineyard and the tribes home base 
establishing a performing arts center and possibly developing a 
resort hotel complex 
neither widdiss nor nynex officials would disclose the exact 
amount of the settlement but widdiss said its in the millions 
of dollars 
the wampanoags began looking at the possibility of running a 
cellular phone service in 1987 as a way to generate revenue for the 
tribe while the tribe itself has no equipment or particular 
expertise in the field the wampanoags had agreed to work with a 
cellular phone company based in hartford conn message center 
management the hartford firm also got an undisclosed percentage of 
the settlement widdiss said 
permits to operate cellular phone service are awarded by the 
federal communications commission each region of the country is 
divided into service areas and the fcc awards a license to one 
company for each area 
wednesdays announced settlement came just before the fcc was to 
conduct a lottery in which one of the competing companies would be 
chosen once selected a company would still have to pass further 
government hurdles before winning a license 
with the announcement of the settlement the drawing for the 
cape cod region was canceled 
nynex is the largest cellular phone service provider in new 
england operating in regions extending from southern new hampshire 
to worcester mass and rhode island 
widdiss said the possibility of winning a cash settlement from a 
competitor was part of the strategy from the beginning when the 
tribe first sought to run the cellular service 
about 280 wampanoag indians live on marthas vineyard and the 
tribe is renting office space in the town of gay head about 250 
acres of land have been put into federal trust for a reservation 
where the indians can build homes

american corporations closed offices in panama and tried to 
assess the damage from the surprise us military action that 
resulted in the first closing of the panama canal in many years 
citibank closed its branches in panama city on wednesday 
soapmaking at the colgatepalmolive co factory halted and borden 
inc shut an ice cream plant 
shippers remained calm in the face of the rare closing of the 
panama canal which has been shut only for landslides in its 
75year history a prolonged closure could delay exports of south 
american fruit raise some prices in the united states and force 
importers to find alternate routes 
the number of us businesses operating in panama has declined 
by roughly 30 percent in recent years because of the unstable 
political environment and a deteriorating economy merrill lynch amp 
co for example moved its panama operations to the cayman islands 
last year 
direct us investment in panama is insignificant said 
nathaniel leff a business professor at columbia university 
its not a country like brazil where there are us 
carmakers and drug companies he said companies that operate 
plants there market panamamade goods mostly within the country 
bordens two factories in panama city were closed because of 
fighting a spokesman said but a third factory that makes 
processed cheese in the northwest province of chirique was 
operating as usual 
all our properties and people are safe said spokesman jim 
mckinley we dont have a feel for when they will open he said 
of the shuttered plants which make ice cream and powdered drink 
mixes 
a spokesman for colgatepalmolive said he did not know when the 
companys panama factory which makes soap toothpaste and 
cleaners would reopen 
citibank closed its six branches in panama city early wednesday 
spokesman ken campbell said the bank was trying to find out how 
employees were affected 
united brands co which owns the chiquita banana brand said 
operations were normal but spokesman peter fay said the company 
feared for the general safety of our employees 
united brands ships 30 million boxes of bananas each year from 
panama fay would not say what percentage travel through the panama 
canal 
exporters found good news in president bushs announcement that 
the united states was lifting economic sanctions against panama 
the us military action followed the secret swearingin of 
opposition leader guillermo endara as panamas president endara 
was widely regarded the winner of may elections but gen manuel 
antonio noriega blocked him from taking power 
at the port of houston where about 15 percent of foreign trade 
moves through the panama canal spokesman lee vela said exporters 
would benefit but we wont know exactly how much until april or 
may 
according to the commerce department the major us exports to 
panama are cigarettes aluminum fuels and perfume 
the 51mile canal lost some strategic importance in the 1950s 
with the development of supertankers and other ships too large to 
traverse its six locks 
still roughly 14 percent of us international sea trade passes 
through the canal government sources said the canal remains 
critical to the shipment of raw materials as well as fruits 
exported from south america 
if youre putting copper ore on a freighter that has to go to 
western europe it has to go through the canal iron ore from 
brazil to japan has got to go through the canal said george 
zimmerman an analyst with gruntal amp co a new york securities 
firm 
but because traveling through the canal can add as much as a 
week to shipping time only goods that are not timesensitive move 
through the waterway a hot consumer electronics product from asia 
that has retailers clamoring probably would not move through the 
canal experts say 
the canal continues to do a lot of business because it is among 
the lowestcost routes air transportation is costly and not all 
goods can be shipped from south american ports up the east and west 
coastlines 
shippers were optimistic that the canal would reopen today 
general motors corp spokeswoman karen longridge said a ship 
loaded with geo metro and storm automobiles from japan was just 
outside the canal resting at sea 
if things dont change in a short period of time we will 
probably send it to the west coast unload it and ship it by rail 
back to the east she said

wang laboratories inc which has posted losses 
and slashed its work force has been criticized for having too 
limited a product line but the computer company says it hopes to 
change its image by making equipment that uses popular 
industrywide standards 
were focusing more and more on our customers said gerry 
paul wangs vice president of systems research and development 
what they want is a wide variety of applications of software 
analysts said the strategy announced wednesday marks an 
important departure for wang and it follows a recent trend in 
which computer companies have been making equipment that is 
compatible across the industry 
wang traditionally has been a closed proprietary equipment 
company said steven wendler an analyst with gartner group inc 
for a company like wang this movement into open systems is a 
very significant philosophical change 
wang said the announcement was part of a general strategy 
outlined by company president richard miller last month in which 
the lowellbased firm is trying to pay closer attention to the 
needs of its customers 
in a statement wednesday miller said that by adopting 
openness both as a product strategy and a state of mind and 
constantly listening to and heeding our customers directions wang 
will succeed in its efforts to grow and remain competitive in the 
1990s and beyond 
wangs strategy calls for integrating standardized technologies 
into its existing product lines and developing new sets of hardware 
and software based on popular industry standards such as unix and 
dos 
for the past two years wang has been making personal computers 
that are compatible with equipment from industry leader 
international business machines corp paul said 
but he added we didnt move as quickly as we should have in 
opening up our products 
wang posted a loss of 621 million in the quarter that ended 
sept 30 as part of the companys new focus miller announced last 
month that wang would cut 2000 jobs in addition to about 5000 
jobs that were eliminated earlier in the year 
part of wangs rebuilding strategy has been to develop socalled 
imaging systems in which documents such as payroll forms or 
insurance claims are electronically scanned and stored in a 
computer 
the documents can be retrieved on a computer screen much as a 
vcr reproduces the images of a movie the technology is aimed at 
reducing the time and cost associated with manually filing 
collating and retrieving documents 
wang said its focus on openness is being blended with the 
imaging technology to enable the broadest possible range of 
users to take advantage of the product 
wang said it hoped to further broaden the use of imaging systems 
through a licensing agreement also announced wednesday with 
novell inc a provo utah company that makes personal computer 
networking systems 
our goal is to provide universal access to wang imaging and 
integration of information and applications miller said 
but while wang continues to build its market in image 
processing more important is the companys movement away from its 
proprietary systems wendler said 
in the next four years he said the image processing market is 
expected to grow to 3 billion but open system technologies are 
expected to represent a 60 billion market 
the prospects for image processing are bright he said 
but the prospects for open systems are much brighter 
wang also said wednesday it had reached an agreement to sell up 
to 30 percent of the shares it holds in its taiwan manufacturing 
subsidiary the buyer was not announced wang said the sale of a 
full 30 percent of the shares would bring it about 120 million 
after taxes

1976 to 1986 plus issued them 89 million worth of rebate coupons 
on other kodak products 
it is probably the most successful outreach program to 
consumers ever said chicago attorney burton i weinstein who 
represented camera owners in a class action lawsuit against kodak 
thats the best return that ive ever heard of said beverly 
moore editor of class action reports in washington dc 
kodak had sold 165 million instant cameras in the united states 
by the time polaroid won its suit the courts have not yet ruled 
how much kodak will have to pay polaroid which is based in 
cambridge mass but stock analysts predict it will be in the 1 
billion to 2 billion range 
kodak has insisted it should pay only 177 million or 5 percent 
royalties on the instant cameras and film it sold 
final arguments in the penalty phase of the trial were filed 
wednesday in us district court in boston 
camera owners filed a class action suit against kodak after the 
company proposed a settlement with them that did not include cash 
attorneys for kodak and the claimants worked out a settlement 
that instead gave each camera owner a cash refund of 19 to 52 
plus rebate coupons worth 18 to 30 for use on kodak products the 
coupons must be used by dec 31 and submitted to kodak by jan 31 
1990 
both sides say the settlement process has gone extremely 
smoothly 
its incredible what was accomplished by the efforts of people 
who were literally at each others throats kodak and us 
weinstein said once there was a settlement kodak worked 
extremely hard to make sure people got compensated 
of the possible claimants 38 million filed claims 34 million 
of which were approved said william j campbell who represented 
kodak in the settlement 
my client spent a heck of a lot of money to advertise the 
settlement nationwide he said they went more than the 
distance 
weinstein estimated that kodak spent about 200 million overall 
on the settlement including advertising and attorneys fees 
administrative and legal costs were less than 10 percent of the 
total he said 
moore called it extraordinary that nearly 25 percent of the 
possible claimants filed claims particularly since as long as 10 
years had elapsed since some people bought their cameras 
kodak could not say how many of the coupons have been used 
spokesman paul allen said the company estimated it would spend 42 
million to redeem the coupons 
kodak expects many of the rebate coupons will be used during the 
christmas season 
claimants were divided into four groups according to how much 
their cameras cost people in all but the group that owned the most 
expensive instant cameras got back more cash than they originally 
spent to buy the camera campbell said all the claimants got more 
than the resale value of their used cameras he said 
even if the claimants didnt use their rebate coupons weinstein 
said theyre way ahead of the game

theres not much to the zube tube the 
ultimate cosmic sound machine but then there wasnt much to the 
hulahoop either 
the 39inchlong brightly colored cardboard tube can produce 
sounds from star wars battles and mtvstyle echoes to gregorian 
chants whale songs and the oceans roar 
the number of noises you want to make are as infinite as your 
imagination said judy a walls senior vice president of ritam 
international ltd a toy company in the southeastern iowa town of 
fairfield 
theres no batteries no electricity she said i think 
everybody is just electroniced out 
inside the 2inch diameter tube is a spring that acts as an 
acoustic coil the spring is connected at each end by custommade 
plastic cups a hole on the side of the tube allows a childs or 
an adults finger to reach in and pluck the spring which 
produces the myriad of sounds 
a person can also speak into the hole as well as either end of 
the tube to produce even more sounds 
we feel its going to be the next hulahoop in its first 18 
months they sold something like 100 million hula hoops mrs 
walls said we plan on doing the same thing i think three years 
is realistic 
some 200000 zube tubes have been sold since it was marketed in 
midseptember she said the suggested retail price is 995 
toy and gift companies in finland switzerland germany france 
england and canada have inquired about the tube 
sandy watsey ritam executive vice president said that while in 
london a group of company officials went to harrods to tape a 
video using the department stores zube tube display however they 
ended up filming an empty display because the store was sold out 
she said 
they say over there that the zube tube is more popular than 
nintendo ms watsey said 
the concept of the zube tube was developed by bob deissler who 
was studying physics at case western reserve university in 
cleveland 
i was playing with a slinky and it happened to touch a 
styrofoam cup said deissler who was visiting the 10yearold 
toy company this week 
intrigued by the sound deissler experimented with a different 
type of spring about a year later 
it worked really great thats when i really decided to pursue 
it he said 
deissler applied for and received a patent in 1980 and contacted 
several large toy companies but none were interested deissler 
later moved to fairfield 
ritam snapped up the product and developed the concept the 
companys other claims to toy fame are electronic games called 
monty plays scrabble and master monty which sell about 10000 
units a year mrs walls said 
zube tube beats them hands down she said the company now is 
turning out up to 5000 zube tubes a day

nelson bunker hunt and william herbert hunt have 
accepted lifetime bans from trading commodities futures and will 
pay a 10 million penalty after they emerge from bankruptcy 
but the hunts who officials say came within weeks of cornering 
the worlds silver market have neither admitted guilt nor claimed 
innocence under terms of the agreement 
the move will help the brothers speed the settlement of their 
personal bankruptcy cases filed after they lost a court case 
stemming from their silver speculation 
in 1985 the federal commodity futures trading commission filed 
a complaint that sought more than 50 million in fines from the 
hunts 
it could have been a very extensive fight and they wouldnt 
have had the money to hire attorneys and continue to litigate after 
settlement of their bankruptcy cases cftc attorney linda groves 
told the dallas morning news 
bunker hunts bankruptcy neared end last week with us 
bankruptcy judge harold abramsons approval of a reorganization 
plan herbert hunts case may end this week 
we were happy to get the cftc decision behind us said 
russell munsch bunker hunts lead bankruptcy attorney it is one 
of those things that bunker would have liked to have gone and 
litigated 
under the agreement on file in dallas bankruptcy court the 
hunts agreed to pay the 10 million penalty out of future income 
gifts and inheritances once they emerge from bankruptcy 
the terms of the cftc agreement say the hunts consent to 
findings the brothers violated the commodity exchange act by 
manipulating the price of silver 
cftc documents on file in washington claim that by the end of 
may 1980 the hunts could have owned virtually the entire 
available world supply of deliverable 999 silver bullion 
the effort collapsed on march 27 1980 the agency said when 
prices fell from about 50 an ounce to about 10 an ounce 
the hunts lost an estimated 13 billion in the collapse and 
then a series of lawsuits and claims were initiated against them 
that toppled their empire

ashland coal inc to spend 143 million to buy the stock of a 
southern west virginia company with lowsulfur coal reserves the 
company said 
environmentalists say sulfur in coal contributes to acid rain 
ashland coal agreed late tuesday to acquire the stock of

million tons of coal annually on the land by 1992 using about 400 
employees it will spend 96 million to develop the land and build 
a preparation plant bringing the total cost of the project to 
nearly 240 million 
the mingologan coal reserves are of exceptional quality 
said william c payne ashland coals president and chief executive 
officer in addition geologic conditions on the property will 
allow us to mine at productivity levels well above industry 
averages 
the land owned by a subsidiary of the norfolk southern corp 
railroad has reserves of about 129 million tons of prime 
lowsulfur coal on about 20000 acres of land in mingo and logan 
counties 
mingologan will give our company access to a new market the 
power plants served by the norfolk southern railroad payne said 
also it is expected to help us expand our presence in the export 
market 
a spokesman for bp america said 20 companies made initial bids 
for the property several sources in the coal industry said there 
were three other finalists at massey coal co island creek 
corp and amax inc 
ashland coal would break into the nations top 20 coal producers 
for the first time with the additional production the charleston 
daily mail reported the company expects to mine and sell 10 
million tons in 1989 
ashland oil inc owns 46 percent of ashland coal and 50 percent 
of arch mineral corp another major national coal producer 
companies are attracted to southern west virginia for its 
lowsulfur coal reserves which could prove valuable if congress 
passes strong acid rain legislation

lighter and wilkinson blade and razor lines from stora of sweden 
the parent company of swedish match 
as part of the deal gillette will acquire swedish matchs 
wilkinson blade and razor business outside of europe which totaled 
about 30 million in sales last year said gillette spokesman david 
fausch 
gillette also will gain a 229 percent nonvoting interest in

swedish match operations is about 600 million 
while gillette is gaining a share of the new company the 
primary interest is in the noneuropean wilkinson blade business 
fausch said 
wilkinson has a very good brand name he said theres a 
lot of potential there 
gillette controls about 60 percent of the world razor market 
but fausch said wilkinson has a strong presence in certain 
countries such as brazil with 8 percent and australia with 17 
percent 
fausch acknowledged that wilkinson represents a direct headon 
competition with trac ii a gillette brand but he said the 
company foresees no complications by the acquisition 
wednesdays announcement came less than a week after gillette 
based in boston said it was streamlining its operations and 
cutting about 750 workers from its payroll but fausch said the 
purchase of part of wilkinsons business fits with gillettes plans 
blades and razors are a core business for this company he 
said this is just a reaffirmation of our core business markets 
the transaction is not expected to have a material effect on 
gillette earnings per share in 1989 and 1990 the company said

kroger co says it has obtained new loans and 
a rotating credit line to refinance more than 2 billion in debt 
from a corporate restructuring in 1988 
new terms with lenders led by citibank chemical bank and first 
national bank of chicago coincide with a mortgage refinancing plan 
that let the supermarket chain reduce the cost of some debt the 
company said wednesday 
under the new terms kroger finananced 205 billion to include 
a 12 billion loan and an 850 million revolving line of credit 
for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the interest rate on the credit line will decline by about 
threefourths of a percent with additional rate reductions based 
on improvement in the ratio of cash flow to cash interest expenses 
kroger said 
our lending banks recognize that in order for kroger to remain 
a strong viable company it must have the ability to respond to 
constantly changing competitive conditions kroger chairman lyle 
everingham said 
by fixing amortization payments at a lower level the new 
terms provide us the flexibility to maintain stateoftheart 
retail stores and to remain competitive in all our markets 
everingham said 
kroger said it expects cash interest in 1990 to be about 460 
million and total interest expenses to reach 590 million that 
compares with 510 million cash interest and 637 million in total 
interest expenses previously estimated 
kroger borrowed 36 billion in october 1988 for a corporate 
restructuring and a special dividend after two unsuccessful 
takeover attempts against the company kroger said strong sales of 
some assets and proceeds from refinancing have enabled it to reduce 
its debt faster than expected and to lengthen the maturities on 
remaining debt 
the new terms are a major step forward in reducing the cost of 
krogers debt and giving the company more operating latitude 
kroger president joseph pichler said 
but he said the 47 billion in debt remaining on the companys 
books will mean the company has to maintain operating performance

the coniston partners investment group has 
threatened to press for a recapitalization of ual corp unless 
united airlines employees come up with a buyout plan for their 
parent company early next month 
but the leader of at least one airline union said wednesday that 
her group wont be rushed into anything by the ultimatum 
in a brief statement issued after the stock market closed 
coniston said it favored a sale of the company to one or more 
employee stock ownership plans and that it has considered becoming 
a longterm equity investor in such a transaction 
but the investment group which owns 118 percent of uals 
stock also said that if no acceptable proposal was put forward by 
jan 8 it intends to work with the companys board of directors 
and their financial and legal advisors to develop and promptly 
implement a recapitalization plan 
a lot of time has passed since the pilots initiated their 
original offer to buy the company said paul tierney one of 
conistons principals we dont think whats required is much 
more time to understand it whats necessary is a decision 
the ultimatum increases the pressure on uniteds pilots ual 
management and the ual board of directors to come up with a new 
buyout plan after a pilotmanagement attempt to buy the company for 
675 billion failed two months ago 
coniston said it had met with representatives of uals board and 
unions and acknowledged that progress had been made toward a new 
deal 
but the partnership said progress has been slow 
patricia friend president of the united flight attendants said 
the union is reviewing a preliminary buyout plan proposed by ual 
management on dec 6 
she said conistons comments wednesday arent likely to change 
her unions strategy which is to take this thing nice and 
slowly one day at a time 
no one will stampede us into anything that is illadvised or 
illconceived she said adding that her union has no meetings 
scheduled this month with ual management 
if coniston and the ual board cannot agree on a recapitalization 
plan coniston said it might proceed with a threatened drive to 
solicit shareholder consent to oust 13 of uals 15 directors and 
create a fivemember board that would include coniston principals 
tierney keith gollust and augustus oliver 
a recapitalization could involve selling assets such as planes 
or routes or borrowing money to make a payout to shareholders 
united has one of the highest percentages of companyowned planes 
in the industry and could raise money by selling some of them and 
leasing them back 
ual spokesman joe hopkins said he had not seen conistons 
statement and could not comment kathie hardin a spokeswoman for 
the united chapter of the air line pilots association also 
declined to comment 
uals stock lost 150 wednesday in new york stock exchange 
trading closing at 157 a share 
ual had traded as high as 294 a share amid the buying frenzy 
that followed the pilotmanagement groups 300ashare offer in 
august british airways plc was to have participated as an equity 
partner in that transaction 
but the deal collapsed oct 13 when banks refused to finance it 
sparking a 190point drop in the dow jones industrial average 
since then ual management has been quietly seeking employee 
support for a proposal that reportedly would value the company at 
240 a share or 543 billion

a connecticut investment company has 
offered to buy the stride rite corp shoe manufacturer for about 
900 million 
stride rite officials declined comment on the unsolicited 
32ashare offer 
walsh greenwood amp co of greenwich and fs champ associates 
representing the minda bronfman de gunzburg family trusts as a 
limited partner made the offer wednesday asked for nonpublic 
information and for a reply by dec 28 
in its offer walsh greenwood which has owned 49 percent of 
stride rite since last february said it would consider options 
after dec 28 and might go directly to stockholders with the same 
or a modified offer 
the offer was made as some analysts lowered their estimates of 
stride rite earnings partly because of the volume of shoes the 
company sells to campeau corp which owns department store chains 
and which may file for chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection 
on the new york stock exchange wednesday stride rite stock 
closed at 2350 down 375 on heavy trading of 13 million 
shares 
the walsh greenwood offer was disclosed just before the market 
closed and the drop in price reportedly reflected earlier news 
that industry analyst barry rothberg of mabon nugent recommended 
selling stride rite stock 
stride rite reported earnings of 347 million or 127 a 
share for the fiscal year ended nov 30 1988 
john j phelan treasurer and chief financial officer of stride 
rite predicted wednesday that the companys earnings for the 1989 
fiscal year will be at the lower end of estimates from 170 to 
180 per share and for the 1990 fiscal year from 2 to 220 per 
share 
phelan said the company has lowered its predicted growth in the 
sales of keds from 30 percent to 10 percent for the 1990 fiscal 
year keds sales rose 40 percent during the 1989 fiscal year 
in its purchase offer walsh greenwood said we have no plans 
to change the manner of the companys operation or the location of 
its headquarters and principal facilities 
in a telephone interview paul r greenwood managing partner of 
walsh greenwood told the boston globe it was too early to tell 
whether he would install his own management team if his company 
takes over stride rite 
we like the company a lot he said we just think it can 
be a lot more than what it is

chinas legislature in a bid to restore 
confidence among businesses and investors has proposed changing a 
law governing joint ventures with foreign firms 
the proposed amendments include guarantees that the government 
will not nationalize or requisition joint ventures the official 
media reported thursday 
the changes also stipulate that partners in a joint venture may 
choose the chairman and vice chairman of their operation under 
current law the chairman must come from the chinese side of the 
partnership 
the new law would not require partners to set a specific time 
for the length of their contract previously all joint ventures 
were for fixed periods often 20 or 30 years 
some 8000 joint ventures have been established since china 
opened its doors 10 years ago and foreign investors have provided 
about 14 billion for business ventures 
chinese leaders have been trying to convince potential investors 
that the investment climate remains favorable despite the political 
turmoil of the prodemocracy movement and a tough government 
austerity program that has stopped implementation of new economic 
reforms 
foreign businessmen are concerned that their independence will 
be limited and that the current conservative atmosphere will mean 
more political interference in their operations 
the draft amendments to the joint venture law are being 
discussed at an ongoing meeting of the national peoples congress 
standing committee they are expected to be passed when the npc 
chinas parliament holds its annual session next spring

mandatory trash separation and recycling in a 160 million program 
to cut in half the amount of garbage deposited in the citys 
rapidly filling landfills 
while about 1000 us cities have some kind of recycling 
program the los angeles effort will be among the nations largest 
along with those in new york city and statewide in new jersey 
mayor tom bradley said he will sign the measure approved 
wednesday 
the era of the disposable society when cans and papers can be 
carelessly tossed aside is coming to an end he said through 
this plan the city now establishes a noexcusesaccepted policy 
when it comes to recycling 
the plan will require all 720000 singlefamily households in 
the city to separate glass and plastic bottles aluminum cans and 
newspaper into different containers for collection the city 
eventually will sell reusable materials to recyclers 
the program is to be phased in over three years with the first 
neighborhoods required to participate by next september

determined whether the city or homeowners will pay for the hundreds 
of thousands of bins and cans needed it also has not been decided 
how the program will be enforced

force private trash haulers to recycle private haulers collect 
garbage from businesses and larger apartment buildings which

tendency for the market and especially smaller stocks to show

the 12 european economic community 
nations on thursday adopted a law that gives the eec veto power 
over large mergers within the trade bloc 
ministers of the common market countries granted the eecs 
administrative arm the european commission authority over mergers 
that currently rests with the governments of the 12 members 
under the new law any proposed merger within the eec that would 
create a company with worldwide revenue of more than 585 billion 
must be approved by the commission 
the law also requires that the commission review a merger 
creating a firm with revenue inside the eec of more than 2925 
million 
transactions valued at amounts under the ceilings approved 
thursday would come under the jurisdiction of individual eec 
members 
the law applies to mergers between two eec companies as well as 
to deals where only one company is an eec firm 
before the law was passed most large mergers were already being 
submitted to the commission to ensure that proposed combinations 
did not violate eec competition rules 
under the law the commission would be allowed to base its 
judgment primarily on the effect a proposed merger would have on 
competition within the eec a narrow standard pushed by britain 
in some cases however the commission will take into account 
the effects of a merger on individual national markets 
the vote ended 16 years of negotiations to bring mergers under 
eec control the agreement was seen as a victory for the french 
government which currently holds the sixmonth rotating eec 
presidency and had set an agreement on the merger law as one of its 
goals

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
lower in early trading today on the chicago board of trade largely 
reflecting followthrough selling from wednesdays weaker close 
forecasts for more badly needed rain in brazil a leading 
soybean producer added to the selling pressure in the soybean 
market this morning 
in the wheat market there were indications that the soviet 
union is seeking to buy european rather than us wheat which 
prompted selling of wheat futures 
losses were limited though by reports of new export sales of 
us grains the agriculture department said it had accepted bids 
from iraq for 11000 metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices and 
mexico was rumored to have bought nearly 205000 metric tons of 
us corn overnight 
the soybean market had led wednesdays decline which analysts 
attributed to seasonal factors and to the temporary closing of the 
panama canal shipments of us soybeans to japan pass through the 
canal which reopened today 
in early trading wheat futures were cent to 1 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in march at 412 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cent lower with march at 238 a bushel oats were 
unchanged to cent higher with march at 152 a bushel soybeans 
were cent to 2 cents lower with january at 573 a bushel 
cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly 
higher in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
the agriculture department announced this morning that its 
monthly coldstorage report which was due out this afternoon will 
be delayed until dec 27 
porkbelly futures had fallen sharply wednesday on expectations 
that the report would show a large net increase in warehoused 
supplies of the commodity 
live cattle futures were 10 cent to 28 cent higher with 
february at 7650 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent lower 
to 20 cent higher with january at 8472 cents a pound live hogs 
were 07 cent lower to 23 cent higher with february at 4907 cents

the transportation department is proposing 
tougher standards for door strength in minivans small buses and 
other lightweight vehicles exempt from some automobile standards 
the proposals announced wednesday would subject all trucks 
buses and multipurpose vehicles with a gross weight rate of 10000 
pounds or less to the same doorstrength crash tests as passenger 
cars 
more and more of these vehicles are being used on the nations 
highways and we believe they should have a higher level of 
protection in sideimpact crashes said jerry ralph curry head 
of the national highway traffic safety administration 
car doors must be built to resist the crushing force of a steel 
cylinder in laboratory tests the new rule to be effective with 
1993 model trucks would go into effect after a 60day period for 
comment 
curry noted that sales of light trucks mostly minivans have 
increased during the 1980s and now total 5 million a year this has 
resulted in increased injuries and deaths to occupants of such 
vehicles he said 
the governments move drew praise from sen jack danforth 
rmo principal sponsor of a bill to require stronger side impact 
protection for small trucks minivans and fourwheel drive 
vehicles the bill cleared the senate in august and is pending in 
the house 
i hope for quick department action to finalize this proposal 
and to build upon it danforth said most families do not 
realize that minivans and other light trucks are not as safe as 
passenger cars

on a sultry night last march eastern airlines 
workers exploded at the stroke of midnight in a frenzy of anger 
against boss frank lorenzo 
the strike against eastern had begun like a giant kettle 
venting steam built up for years more than 2500 redshirted 
strikers defied riot police lobbed rocks bottles and cinderblocks 
at their employers fenced miami headquarters and shredded a scab 
worker effigy 
ten months later the eastern drama has been played out in 
federal bankruptcy court congress and smokefilled union halls 
the most emotional strike in us airline history has been broken 
and the strikers are broke 
it was more than a wage dispute it was a show of force between 
an owner seeking to reshape a moneylosing airline and employees 
determined to block what they considered his unionbusting 
lorenzo who bought eastern in early 1986 seems to have left 
his mark on industrial history with a key victory he has 
vanquished the unions hired replacements at lower wages and 
restructured eastern as a smaller carrier 
its a tragedy of all sorts of dimensions said mark kahn 
an independent labor arbitrator in detroit he lorenzo has 
completely undermined the notion of loyalty on the part of 
employees 
the pilots who crippled the airline in march by walking out in 
sympathy with the machinists capitulated just before thanksgiving 
striking flight attendants did the same but both groups face bleak 
prospects of returning to their old jobs filled mainly by 
nonunion hires 
only the machinists remain on lonely picket lines many have 
scraped by with parttime work to supplement 100 a week in union 
strike pay some have left to take jobs elsewhere 
still lorenzos victory might prove shortlived the strikers 
may not get their jobs back but they might feel partly vindicated 
if the new year brings a serious recession which could knock a 
fragile eastern off its feet 
a recession would have a very strong impact said louis a 
marckesano an airline analyst at janney montgomery scott inc in 
philadelphia 
many experts are expecting the economy to weaken substantially 
next year and the airline industry usually bears the brunt of a 
downturn analysts single out eastern pan am corp and trans world 
airlines inc as financially shaky and the most vulnerable 
it would be difficult for eastern to lure passengers with cheap 
fares in a recession since all the big carriers now price flights 
competitively and fare cuts are usually matched by rivals 
marckesano said easterns recent projection that it will turn a 
modest profit in the second half of next year is an optimistic 
forecast the airline told creditors this past week it expects to 
lose 250 million in the fourth quarter that would bring easterns 
net loss for 1989 to nearly 820 million a record high for the 
nations airline industry 
can lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp and 
the most aggressive practitioner of airline deregulation pull off 
his bold gambit 
do they eastern have a chance sure but it can be quite a 
task said edward starkman who follows the industry for 
painewebber inc in new york he called the reshaped eastern 
basically a startup airline an atlantahubbed airline with 
some northeasttoflorida business 
in recent months eastern has been building up atlanta as its 
hub and dehubbing miami where it still maintains its 
headquarters near the airport 
lorenzos knockout punch came this past week when rival 
american airlines finally agreed after months of haggling to buy 
easterns prized latin american routes and other assets from texas 
air for 471 million in one stroke the deal made american a major 
international carrier and shrank eastern to about twothirds of its 
prestrike size 
the deal with american capped a series of sales of eastern jets 
routes and airport gates to several other airlines the asset 
sales made over several months and approved by us bankruptcy 
judge burton r lifland already had totaled about 688 million 
before the latin american routes were transferred 
the proceeds put into an escrow account will be used to pay 
easterns creditors 
for the longer term many observers believe lorenzos ultimate 
master plan is to merge eastern with sister carrier continental 
airlines the other main subsidiary of texas air the gradual 
disappearance of the unions from eastern would allow a fit with 
nonunion continental 
lorenzos handling of continental seemed to be a dress rehearsal 
for what happened at eastern he restructured continental as a 
nonunion carrier in 1983 after a strike and bankruptcy proceeding 
observers believe a merger of the two could come sometime after 
eastern emerges from chapter 11 protection anticipated for early 
next year 
i think subsequently the two airlines will merge therell be 
no point in keeping them apart from texas airs point of view 
said kahn in effect youve got one airline operating as two 
divisions 
the eastern unions have long suspected lorenzo intended to merge 
the two airlines charging that his transfers of some eastern 
assets to continental are part of the plan 
the issue is so emotionally charged that even flight attendants 
uniforms have been swept up into the dispute new navy blue outfits 
for attendants at eastern and continental due early next year have 
raised the unions hackles since they are almost the same for both 
carriers and replace uniforms that were completely different colors 
but then again everything about eastern is emotional and 
seemingly intractable

the merger of the kansas city star and 
the kansas city times will take place march 1 the editor of the 
newspapers said thursday 
joe mcguff editor and vice president said march 1 was a good 
date because it was the start of a billing cycle plans to merge 
the morning times and the afternoon star were announced oct 5 
mcguff said the decision came about because of sagging demand for 
afternoon papers and changing lifestyles 
the newspaper to be called the kansas city star will publish 
in the morning 
mcguff said it would be larger and better organized than the 
current morning newspaper he said it would try to appeal to 
readers who wish to linger over indepth articles and those who 
prefer to scan for facts

players in the eastern airlines strike and bankruptcy proceeding 
which began in early march

eastern and continental airlines denounced as a robber baron 
by unions and considered an airline industry pioneer by some 
phil bakes president of miamibased eastern reporting to 
lorenzo a former attorney for the civil aeronautics board he was 
influential in drawing up the 1978 law deregulating the us 
airline industry 
charles bryan leader of the machinists union at eastern known

management who adopted a low public profile after the walkout 
began 
jack bavis former head of eastern pilots union thrown out by 
the membership in september for proposing that they consider ending 
their strike he was replaced by skip copeland a hardliner on the 
strike 
the pilots reversed their position shortly before thanksgiving 
and voted to call off their walkout which had been in sympathy 
with the machinists wage dispute the eastern flight attendants 
union headed by mary jane barry quickly followed suit 
burton r lifland the us bankruptcy judge overseeing 
easterns chapter 11 proceeding that began march 9 in federal court 
in new york a powerful judge known for biting sarcasm he took an 
aggressive approach to his goal of getting eastern flying again

sride rite corp the leading us maker 
and retailer of childrens footwear said thursday it will ignore a 
dec 28 deadline for a response to an investment companys 900 
million takeover offer 
john j phelan treasurer and executive vice president of stride 
rite released a letter saying his company would not make an 
immediate decision on the 32 pershare offer from a group led by 
walsh greenwood amp co of greenwich conn 
walsh greenwood had requested that stride rite come to a 
conclusion on the matter by dec 28 
that request is quite unreasonable as it would provide us with 
only four business days to consider the matter phelan wrote in 
the letter addressed to walsh greenwood managing general partner 
stephen walsh 
phelan wrote that the stride rite board would discuss the matter 
in early january and would respond to walsh greenwood at that time 
walsh greenwood and fs champ associates representing the minda 
bronfman de gunzburg family trusts as a limited partner made the 
offer wednesday 
walsh greenwood which has owned 49 percent of stride rite 
since last february announced wednesday it would consider other 
options after the dec 28 deadline and might go directly to 
stockholders with an offer 
as the offer was made some analysts lowered their estimates of 
stride rite earnings partly because of the volume of shoes the 
company sells to financially troubled campeau corp which owns 
department store chains that may seek chapter 11 federal bankruptcy 
protection because of heavy debts 
on the new york stock exchange thursday morning stride rite 
stock was up 3 to 26 
the walsh greenwood offer was announced just before the market 
closed wednesday 
stride rite reported earnings of 347 million or 127 a 
share for the fiscal year ended nov 30 1988 
phelan predicted the companys earnings for the 1989 fiscal year 
will be at the lower end of estimates from 170 to 180 per 
share and for the 1990 fiscal year from 2 to 220 per share 
which is lower than wall street estimates 
in its purchase offer walsh greenwood said we have no plans 
to change the manner of the companys operation or the location of 
its headquarters and principal facilities 
stride rite based in cambridge mass is the leading 
childrens shoemaker and retailer in the country with more than 
180 stores and more than 60 sections in department stores it also 
manufactures boating and outdoor recreational shoes and adult 
workboots and imports athletic and casual wear

the stock market chalked up a small gain today 
pulling out of a weeklong slide 
trading was moderate 
analysts said evidence of a new move wednesday toward easier

might benefit from the socalled january effect a historical 
tendency for the market and especially smaller stocks to show

sears roebuck and co was accused in a 
lawsuit filed thursday by new yorks attorney general that the 
retailers everyday low prices policy is a fraud sears denied 
the charges 
under the pricing policy announced in march sears said it would 
cut back drastically on the number of sales it conducts but would 
offer many items at lower prices every day 
but attorney general robert abrams said thursday that a shopping 
survey by his office in many of sears 42 new york stores indicated 
that isnt the case 
in fact when consumers went to make purchases they were 
paying essentially the same price as under the old system he 
said and in a number of instances they were actually paying a 
higher price 
abrams said he believes the problem may not be limited to sears 
operations in new york 
we believe that this is a nationwide practice that is being 
conducted by sears in all their stores throughout the united 
states said abrams im alerting my colleagues the attorneys 
general of the other states of this investigation so that sears 
might be facing similar action by others 
michael bozic chairman and chief executive of sears 
merchandising group denied the company was misleading the public 
we are shocked by the distorted and untrue statements the new 
york state attorney general made to news media today regarding 
sears everyday low pricing bozic said in a news release 
we have a valuable reputation for trust and integrity with 
american consumers and we intend to prove these malicious charges 
are false he said 
sears the nations largest retailer has 847 stores in the 
united states 
in the lawsuit filed in state supreme court in buffalo abrams 
alleged that sears portrayed the everyday low price policy as a 
perpetual sale creating the false impression that the new prices 
represented cutrate discounts from sears previous prices 
for instance he said a canister vacuum which sold most 
frequently at a sale price of 19999 under the old system was 
listed at an everyday low price of 21999 
similarly a living room set which most often sold at 89994 
before march cost 979 under the everyday low price system 
abrams said his office received information on sears prices and 
number of units sold by monitoring advertisements and obtaining 
actual sales figures from the company 
sears advertised that in effect every day virtually every 
item would be on sale he said we have found that they have 
deceived consumers that the prices that people pay are not 
substantial sale bonus discounted prices 
about 20 items were priced abrams said bozic said thats too 
small a number to accurately reflect all of the items sears sells 
while we have not yet reviewed his lawsuit we believe that it 
is based on an investigation of only 14 items out of the more than 
100000 items we sell he said this in itself is 
misleading 
thursdays action marks the second time in three years abrams 
office has had problems with sears marketing 
in 1986 abrams office and sears reached a settlement where the 
company paid a 75000 fine to settle a complaint that it engaged 
in false advertising 
in that case the state accused sears of claiming that items 
were discounted from regular prices when in fact the items almost 
never sold for the regular price 
we caught them doing that they were fined 75000 and they 
pledged never to do it again said abrams we have shopped in 
the store on a weekly basis over an 18month period and we caught 
them doing the same thing again 
the suit filed thursday also charged that sears violated its 
1986 agreement 
the state asked the court to fine sears stop it from engaging 
in such practices in the future and order restitution for consumers 
who were induced to buy items because of the fraudulent 
advertising and sales practices

the nation boosted energy futures sharply higher thursday 
home heating oil for january delivery shot up 405 cents to

cents a gallon on the mercantile exchange with later months also 
rising sharply 
fiedler said traders were anticipating weatherrelated problems

make gasoline supplies tighter

prices continued that trend thursday west texas intermediate the

consumer spending rebounded 07 percent in 
november from its sharp fall a month earlier the government 
reported thursday and analysts said it continues to be one of the 
bright spots in a slowing economy 
it suggests that while we have some weak areas in the economy 
particularly in the manufacturing sector that the consumer has not 
turned off completely said david jones an economist with aubrey 
g lanston amp co in new york 
the commerce department also reported an 08 percent increase in 
personal incomes in november but some analysts questioned whether 
income growth will soon begin to weaken and thus cause a decline in 
spending 
the report said consumer spending rose at a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate to 354 trillion a 07 percent increase and the 
steepest gain since a 1 percent jump last april 
the advance was a rebound from a 02 percent decline in october 
which was the first decrease since a 01 percent dip in september 
1988 and the largest drop since a 14 percent fall in january 1987 
consumer spending which has been a major factor for the 
economic growth during the first nine months of the year is 
watched closely as a barometer of economic health because it 
accounts for about twothirds of the nations economic activity 
commerce reported last week that retail sales rose 08 percent 
in november a rebound from a 13 percent decrease in october 
analysts said it reflected the start of the christmas buying season 
the weekend after thanksgiving 
as measured by the gross national product the economy grew at a 
3 percent rate in the third quarter after gains of 37 percent in 
the first and 25 percent in the second but analysts expect a 
sharp decline in the threemonth period ending dec 31 
jones said prospects are good for continued consumer spending 
particularly in nondurables such as apparel and in the services 
area because consumers are still basically optimistic and have 
income growth to support that optimism 
personal incomes in november totaled 454 trillion at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate following a similar 08 percent 
gain to 450 trillion in october it was the largest increase 
since a 1 percent gain last march 
but lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser for the wefa 
group a bala cynwyd pa forecasting group said there were a 
number of factors that could lead to decreased spending 
the negatives are the high debt loads he said people now 
are getting more concerned about the future youre seeing more 
layoffs and particularly for durables the pentup demand we had 
in the earlier 80s has just been used up people just dont have 
the same needs 
the 262 billion increase in personal consumption which 
includes everything except interest payments on debt contrasted to 
a 63 billion decrease in october 
purchases of durable goods bigticket items expected to last 
more than three years rose 19 billion while purchases of 
nondurable goods jumped 124 billion spending on services 
increased 119 billion 
the november report showed that americans incomes after taxes 
rose 09 percent up from octobers 08 percent gain 
americans savings rate savings as a percent of disposable 
income rose to 61 percent up from octobers 57 percent rate 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
edged up 17 billion in november following a 294 billion gain in 
october 
payrolls at manufacturing companies hit hardest by the federal 
reserves highinterest polices fell 49 billion after an 
october advance of 63 billion

braniff inc and the irish aviation company 
gpa group plc announced an agreement thursday for the return to gpa 
of five jetliners leased earlier this year to the orlandobased 
airline 
the announcement came 10 days after gpa filed lawsuits against 
the carrier in orlando and in kansas city mo seeking the return 
of five airbus industrie a320 planes gpa had accused the airline 
of failing to pay 3 million owed for the jets by a nov 27 
deadline 
we are returning the a320s as a show of good faith that we 
wish to work together with gpa as we continue to reorganize our 
finances under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code 
braniff spokeswoman ann cook said in a statement 
gpas lawsuits against braniff cook said will be dismissed 
and gpa will also drop its claim for attorneys fees and cost 
claims over the lawsuits 
in december 1988 gpa agreed to lease braniff a total of 26 of 
the 150seat airbus a320s under terms of that agreement braniff 
also purchased 24 more of the aircraft from airbus industrie a 
european consortium 
the airline also holds options to buy an additional 50 of the 
jetliners 
braniff is actively attempting to market these rights to 
maximize the value of the a320s said cook who also said 
thursdays accord over the return to gpa of the five planes did not 
affect the two companies rights over the other 21 airliners 
on sept 28 braniff filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
and sharply reduced its scheduled passenger service the airline 
suspended all scheduled service nov 6 but remains a charter 
carrier 
braniff also announced thursday a net loss for the quarter ended

boeing co plans layoffs in the first half of 
1990 particularly among production workers at everett chairman 
frank shrontz said thursday 
shrontzs comment in a seattle times interview confirmed recent 
speculation that jobs would be cut at the giant aerospace company 
shrontz said it was too early to specify how many workers would 
be laid off but it is pretty clear we will bring down employment 
in the puget sound area in the first half of next year he 
characterized the layoffs as modest 
in the early 1970s as many as 60000 workers lost their jobs in 
a twoyear period 
boeing employs about 107000 people in washington state and 
165000 worldwide 
shrontz said the company had anticipated a reduction in 
production workers who were needed for startup work on the 747400 
jetliner but originally had not thought layoffs would be necessary 
but increased experience and productivity on the assembly lines 
is lessening the need for all the workers shrontz said even 
though the company is experiencing a record surge in orders 888 
jets worth 467 billion this year there is also an 85 billion 
backlog of more than 1700 planes 
shrontz said he had hoped excess workers could be transferred to 
work on the b2 stealth bomber but b2 work was slowed as part of 
defensebudget cutbacks leaving the extra commercial jet workers 
nowhere to go 
boeing a subcontractor to the northrop corp on the new bomber 
has had nearly 10000 people working on the b2 
shrontz said some engineers in wichita kan also may lose 
their jobs 
a 48day machinists union strike that ended last month 
clearly hurt our profitability shrontz said but he declined 
to be specific 
boeing had been expected to deliver 94 jets during the fourth 
quarter but now may deliver less than half that number 
we hope to get the factories back up to speed in the first 
quarter he said 
on another topic he said boeing clearly has been hurt in 
image by a flurry of federal investigations and charges filed 
this year 
the defense business is very difficult he said there is 
still a significant resentment against defense contractors by the 
public and i foresee this climate will continue 
richard fowler a former boeing aerospace employee was recently 
convicted of 39 counts of document trafficking and fraud in federal 
court in alexandria va boeing agreed to pay a 52 million fine 
and pleaded guilty to two counts of illegally receiving secret 
government documents in the case 
whats so frustrating about this is that it occurred in the 
early 1980s said shrontz i think weve gained substantially 
in ethics since then 
he said the company has found no further evidence of fraud or 
misconduct in federal investigations of project billings the 
government continues to investigate the overbilling allegations 
on other topics shrontz said that while boeing is reorganizing 
its defense business divisions the company will stay in defense 
work 
well find our niche he said 
it likely will be a few months before boeing knows if its 
proposed 777 widebody twinjet is viable he said possible 
participation in the 777 by japanese manufacturers is up in the 
air as are firm orders from airlines
