the amount of water going for irrigation in 
the united states has declined in recent years mostly because 
farmers have shifted millions of acres out of irrigation entirely 
says an agriculture department report 
john hostetler and michale moore of the departments economic 
research service said that until the 1980s the spread of 
irrigation in the united states was as persistent as an incoming 
tide 
but preliminary figures by the us geological survey which 
collects nationwide water use data every five years indicate that 
about 137 billion gallons of water a day went for agricultural 
irrigation in 1985 down nearly 6 percent from 145 billion a day in 
1980 
this was an unprecedented decline resulting from a 17 
percent drop in the use of water pumped from underground sources 
or groundwater they said agricultures use of water drawn from 
reservoirs lakes rivers and other surface sources increased 
slightly from 1980 to 1985 
groundwater accounted for less than 34 percent of the water used 
for irrigation in 1985 compared with 40 percent a decade earlier 
hostetler said the turnaround since 1980 partly reflects water 
conservation efforts participation in farm programs and declining 
net income from irrigation 
although water conservation measures are important the major 
factor in the reduced water use is not that irrigators have 
tightened up on their spigots hostetler said rather it is the 
shift of acreage out of irrigation 
the us irrigated crop area climbed for decades rising to more 
than 50 million acres in 1978 it edged down slightly in 1982 
before dropping sharply to 447 million acres in 1984 
hostetler said that declines in irrigated acreage have been 
reported in texas oklahoma arizona new mexico colorado and 
utah states where irrigators depend heavily on groundwater 
supplies and where water tables have been falling 
the shift in acres from irrigation not only reflects the drop in 
water tables and rising energy costs to pump the water but the 
relatively weak commodity prices of the 1980s 
roughly half the irrigation systems in the country are driven 
by electric motors and electricity prices are going up 
hostetler says in the april issue of farmline magazine in the 
southern plains texas and oklahoma natural gas is the major 
energy source and gas prices have been rising since deregulation 
thus many farmers have cut water use drastically or have 
shifted to dryland farming 
all of the adjustments seem to be having an impact he said in 
the texas high plains the water table reportedly rose more than 
half a foot in 1986 the first increase in 36 years as 
aboveaverage rainfall helped replenish the aquifer 
but other parts of the country have put more acres under 
irrigation at least through 1984 until recently arkansas was 
increasing its rice acreage all of which is irrigated and farmers 
in the southeast increased irrigation to handle the double cropping 
of wheat and soybeans 
these trends may have slowed in the last few years but delta 
farmers are still shifting acres into corn generally relying on 
irrigation the economists reported and in the corn belt and 
upper midwest supplemental irrigation probably continues to grow 
as farmers augment rainfall to boost yields and protect themselves 
against dry spells 
government crop and land conservation programs will probably 
pull some additional acres out of production and the pressures on 
farmers in the plains to cut water use will continue hostetler 
said 
but higher commodity prices when coupled with the 
yieldboosting appeal of irrigation could alter the economic 
equation 
a lot of people who dropped out of irrigated production in 
recent years still have the equipment sitting around ready to 
use he said if commodity prices were to strengthen 
significantly youd probably see many of them starting up the 
pumps again

many hog producers are proceeding slowly with 
expansion plans and a quick look at the traditional hogcorn ratio 
helps explain why 
the ratio expresses the number of bushels of corn equal in value 
to 100 pounds of live hog the agriculture department says that in 
march the ratio dropped to 228 down from 25 in february and 322 
in march 1987 
the higher the ratio the easier it is for hog producers to 
recover their feed costs there are many other factors affecting 
decisions of pork producers but feed costs still are important 
the march ratio which was included last week in usdas monthly 
report on farm prices was based on preliminary figures which 
showed the farm price of corn at 184 per bushel and the average 
price of hogs at 4190 per hundredweight 
a year ago corn was 147 per bushel and hogs 4740 per 
hundredweight

world inventories of cotton are expected to 
decline 10 percent to about 29 million bales by the end of the 
198788 crop season according to agriculture department analysts 
despite the inventory decline world cotton prices have dropped 
since their peak last august and are now close to what they were a 
year ago the departments economic research service said in the 
april issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
the exceptionally large 1987 us crop and continued upward 
revision of foreign crop estimates are factors in the price 
decline the report said 
us cotton production is estimated at 147 million bales up 51 
percent from 1986 foreign output is expected to total 64 million 
bales up 6 percent from the 198687 season

the night betsy wilson first appeared in public 
after losing part of her jaw to cancer in 1972 she was leaving a 
tennis stadium when she caught a young boy staring at her twisted 
and misshapen mouth 
i just went baaah like i was some sort of a monster it made 
me embarrassed and it made me laugh said mrs wilson and it 
made me deal with it 
the left side of her lower jaw had been removed because of an 
unusual lip cancer that traveled along the nerves of her face 
radiation killed the cancer and a bone bank provided her with a new 
jaw but it left her permanently disfigured 
the 55yearold concord resident still gets stares but she no 
longer thinks of herself as monstrouslooking instead she is 
using what she learned from the deformity to organize and promote a 
national mutualhelp network she started last year called lets 
face it 
mrs wilson the mother of two sons and a daughter says others 
with facial deformities need to overcome their isolation and 
negotiate a world that sees them as different and sometimes 
frightening 
everyone reacts differently thats the hard thing youre 
constantly surprised youre not looking at yourself and you 
forget but youre constantly reminded she said this weekend in 
an interview from berkeley calif where she was visiting her 
daughter and husband and making contacts 
mutual help is the thing its not complicated its 
costeffective she said 
lets face it which is based in concord has 200 official 
members in 30 cities and a mailing list of 2000 but it is 
estimated there are 450000 new cases of facial disfigurement each 
year in this country from auto accidents burns cancer and birth 
defects she said 
mrs wilson wants to help them help each other but it takes 
time largely because of the reluctance of such individuals to 
accept themselves 
it took me years and i mean years to do my grieving over 
losing my face she said but denial is also such protection 
it helps you survive 
lets face it provides such resources as lists of organizations 
that help the facially disfigured educational films and videotapes 
and books 
family members need help too the patient is the pebble 
dropped in the pond of the family she said 
in the wake of her illness mrs wilson and her husband jack 
separated he moved to california where he is dean of a law 
school they stay in touch but she said that if lets face it 
existed in the 1970s they might still be together 
we were traumatized we didnt know how to talk about our 
feelings and were still learning our sexuality was invaded 
and we didnt know how to deal with it except to be afraid 
the first lets face it was founded three years ago by a british 
woman christine piff her experiences losing her palate and left 
eye to cancer were recounted in her book lets face it 
mrs wilson read the book then went to england to meet ms piff 
before starting the american branch of lets face it which also 
has members in australia canada new zealand and south africa 
we have a body and we have a spirit and i wasnt given much of 
a choice mrs wilson said i cant hide behind being an 
attractive woman

hispanic voters may become pivotal players in 
todays colorado democratic precinct caucuses where jesse jackson 
and michael dukakis are fighting for the winners share of 
colorados 45 national delegates at stake 
on the republican side pat robertson supporters hope a flurry 
of weekend campaigning by their candidate stops vice president 
george bushs bid for a sweep of colorados 36 gop delegates 
because bush is almost certain to win the gop nomination no 
matter what robertson does here the democratic caucuses have 
taken center stage 
the fourtier process for choosing the delegates which 
progresses through county congressional district and state 
conventions begins at 2784 neighborhood meetings tonight 
at those precinct meetings which are expected to draw about 
20000 democrats statewide presidential preference polls will be 
taken and roughly 10000 delegates to the county conventions will 
be selected on the basis of those polls delegates either will be 
committed to one of the four democratic candidates or they will be 
uncommitted 
dukakis has been endorsed by gov roy romer and state democratic 
chairman buie seawell two of colorados six super delegates to 
the national convention some political observers like seawell 
think the key to winning democratic delegates may be found in the 
hispanic community 
hispanics make up about 12 percent of the registered voters 
statewide and under party rules the colorado delegation to the 
democratic national convention in july will be at least 20 percent 
hispanic officials said 
jesse jackson is going after the hispanic voter very 
aggressively said former new mexico gov toney anaya who 
campaigned for jackson here last week 
but dukakis who speaks fluent spanish has done well among 
hispanics in contests so far dukakis campaign officials however 
say the massachusetts governor did not target hispanics here 
we are carrying out the same level of campaigning that we are 
elsewhere said richard ybarra dukakis western states director 
and a soninlaw of farmworker activist caesar chavez 
jackson organizers were counting heavily on his easter weekend 
appearances to draw supporters to the caucuses 
black churches have been a primary source of support for us 
and we are targeting those churches said the rev j langston 
boyd jacksons colorado coordinator 
dukakis visited a shelter for the homeless in denver on 
saturday saying he is a doer not just a talker 
bob johnson one of five paid dukakis staffers in colorado 
predicted that democrats would begin to focus on one democrat to 
beat bush and that democrat will be dukakis 
gore has not been in colorado recently but his staff has been 
busy trying to drum up support mike veit gores colorado 
director said the strategy has been to seek support outside 
metropolitan denver 
illinois sen paul simon who has not campaigned in colorado is 
not expected to be a factor tonight 
at the republican caucuses bush supporters hoped to prevent an 
ambush by robertson and his invisible army 
republicans will take nonbinding straw polls at some caucuses 
tonight but they are not required to do so 
delegates also will be selected for county conventions later 
this month but they will not be committed to any candidate 
turnout at the caucuses is expected to be a problem said 
tom hockaday bushs western regional coordinator bush will win 
a majority at the caucuses but we dont know by how much 
robertson is still a player 
robertson campaign aides set up 10 telephone banks to try to 
persuade at least 10000 people to show up for tonights caucuses 
david nelson a denver businessman who is coordinating 
robertsons colorado campaign said his goal was to win onethird 
to onehalf of colorados 36 gop delegates for robertson

harder than those laid in peters hollow down the creek 
the eggs are tapped small end to small end while the contestants 
stand in a circle until only the hardest one is left 
some families keep carefully guarded secrets about the way their 
eggs are boiled and colored and what they feed their chickens 
gebe ritchie who has been chief judge and master of ceremonies 
for 27 years said every shellhardening trick in the book has been

lela powell looks to the heavens for 
guidance in choosing the ideal president the answers she says 
are all in the stars 
the tulsa astrologer is busy piecing together the birth charts 
of the men who would be president saying they provide clues to the 
candidates haracter and abilities 
a quick look at the chart for massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis a scorpio shows the democrat is a hard worker 
wellorganized a man who takes charge mrs powell said 
george bushs chart suggests the vice president a gemini has 
strong leadership qualities and excellent potential for growth she 
said 
mrs powell has studied astrology since the 1950s after having 
her own birth chart read while living in san francisco her 
interest in astronomy also encouraged her to explore astrology she 
said 
astrology simply seeks to answer the more philosophical why to 
things instead of just the more scientific how of astronomy she 
said 
mrs powell says there is more to her analysis of the 
presidential candidates than the popular generic astrological 
forecast which she calls just a little sunsign psychology or 
tabloids outlandish psychic predictions which she calls 
tacky 
she said she is carefully studying each of the major candidates 
astrological charts using an understanding of astronomy and 
mathematics in determining each mans leadership ability 
the natal chart for a leader is really good because it shows 
us what hes really like she said 
that chart known as a birth chart is drawn with the help of 
the candidates birth date and time and place of birth she said 
aquarian presidents have been among the most successful 
including abraham lincoln franklin d roosevelt and ronald 
reagan there are no aquarians in the remaining field of candidates 
they may not have been the smartest but they were the most 
popular mrs powell said of the aquarian presidents 
jesse jackson a libra is sincere a peacemaker and has great 
ability to cause change according to his astrological chart 
fellow democrat albert gore jr an aries has one of the most 
impressive charts of all the candidates mrs powell said not only 
was he born under the sign regarded as representing independence 
and leadership but his birth chart suggests he has excellent 
potential and works in a businesslike fashion she said 
however gores chart indicates his political success could come 
later in life because of a strong indication of future development 
and growth mrs powell said gore only turned 40 this past week 
illinois sen paul simon is seen as the philosopher among the 
democrats according to the chart for the sagittarian he tends to 
concentrate on basic issues perhaps domestic concerns more so than 
foreign affairs mrs powell said

roughest districts and teaching it in schools 
its nothing superhuman what im doing alphin said its 
being sensitive to others its being considerate its being 
understanding its looking at people like youre all gods 
children 
growing up in the black neighborhoods of st louis in the 1940s 
and 1950s alphin dealt with trouble the only way he knew how we 
had to fight to survive he said 
i thought that nonviolence was sissy said alphin who 
joined the police force in 1964 and later became a homicide 
investigator i thought that it wasnt the way to solve 
problems 
alphin has come so far from his days as a street fighter that 
nbc has chosen him as the subject of a television movie about 
kings legacy 
im honored delighted overwhelmed said alphin 47 but 
its not really important who the messenger is the most important 
thing is that the message will be heard 
the movie tentatively is for broadcast in early 1989 
we wanted to do a piece to illustrate the teaching of martin 
luther king and the philosophy he stood for and that even all these 
years later the dream lives on said lucy johnson who is 
coproducing the movie with harry belafonte for lorimar productions 
in los angeles 
johnson said alphin was chosen because he was personally 
affected by king only after the civil rights leaders assassination 
on april 4 1968 
alphin said his experience with prejudice was minimal while he 
was growing up because he lived in a nearly allblack neighborhood 
but alphin said when he went into the armed forces he saw 
firsthand what king was protesting because prejudice was prevalent 
but not until 1981 and a chance acquaintance with bernard 
lafayette a civil rights worker from the 1960s did the officer 
begin comprehending the power of nonviolence 
lafayette invited alphin to join him and others on a trip 
through the south to gauge the progress of blacks since the freedom 
rides of 1961 
that was the most educational nine days of my life alphin 
said i guess that was the first time i really realized about 
black folks history about what the struggle meant 
upon his return alphin attended workshops at the martin luther 
king jr center for nonviolent social change in atlanta last year 
he taught his first class there he also is president of a st 
louis support group that presents workshops on nonviolence and 
sponsors trips to the center 
in 1986 and 1987 alphin commanded the police departments 
homicide division his beliefs were tested to the limit 
i used to drive home and pray and ask god why he sent me down 
here i just didnt understand why i was a nonviolent person in 
the most violent area homicide sex crimes and child abuse 
alphin recalled 
alphin let it be known that he would tolerate no violence from 
his officers said sgt tom godfrey a homicide detective he was 
as compassionate toward suspects as he was toward victims godfrey 
said 
alphin also has been successful convincing young people that 
there are alternatives to violence he is one of several adults in 
a group founded last year to counsel university city high school 
students suspended for fighting 
charles in a group with those kids is the best role model 
said principal doris randolph hes a bill cosby type he knows 
how to respond to them

spring rains have turned the 
expansive mound that is love canal into a green playground for 
wormfat robins feeding at the site of the former chemical dump 
its peaceful here said nunzio loverdi one of a few 
residents fighting to remain in their neighborhood among the 
boardedup houses and yellow signs that warn of toxic contamination 
loverdi and others are in danger of losing their homes but its 
not directly because of the industrial chemicals that once made the 
community synonomous with environmental disaster 
federal and local officials want to tear down the lowincome 
housing project where he lives because they say it will cost too 
much to renovate 
i feel doublecrossed said loverdi who with other 
residents hired an attorney for possible court action to block the 
citys plan they said we could stay here until there was proof 
that we were in danger from the chemicals 
in the summer of 1978 people in the quiet residential community 
began to complain of fumes and chemicals oozing from their 
basements the state health department investigated declared an 
emergency and moved families out of homes built on the dump 
families living in a 10block area near the site were given the 
option of a buyout and those in the nearby lasalle housing project 
where loverdi lives were given the option of moving to another 
city project 
loverdi stayed because he doubted a chemical peril after the 
extensive containment efforts and because the parklike project was 
a nice place to live the lasalle projects modern apartments with 
spacious yards were unlike any other public housing in the 
industrial city of 77000 
loverdi said officials promised residents they could stay until 
the completion of a study on whether the neighborhood is habitable 
an estimated 175 other families are awaiting the results of the 
study to decide whether they can return 
loverdi 54 and his wife are one of the 19 families that stayed 
in the 304unit project 
the embattled few in the project and several dozen families who 
live in nearby homes all know each another and stick together 
theyve been to countless meetings with officials and know all 
about dioxin and the other chemicals dumped by hooker chemical co 
in the 1940s and 50s in the aborted waterway project that 
neighborhood children used as a swimming hole 
generally the remaining residents are older and stubborn about 
not leaving their homes said anita gabalski who works at the 
state department of environmental conservation office in love canal 
many of them are hostile and bitter at this point gabalski 
said they raised their families here and want more than anything 
to have the place restored to the way it was they see the fight 
over the lasalle project as a threat to their future and 
lifestyle 
she said residents are particularly resentful of 
environmentalists who want to preserve love canal as a symbol of 
the dangers of industrial pollution 
we dont want to be anybodys cause said louise louis a 
longtime resident they environmentalists would be just as 
happy if the whole area was torn down but this is our home and 
weve got to fight for it 
michael raymond director of the niagara falls housing 
authority said the decision to tear down the project was not an 
environmental decision but an economic one 
federal officials are unwilling to spend the 35000 per unit 
or 87 million to renovate the buildings raymond said in the 10 
years since the emergency declaration there have been few repairs 
to them and the weather and vandals have taken their toll

indianas republicans are taking a new look 
at the partys strategy in 1988 with a focus on women 
its a universal problem for republicans admits gop state 
chairman gordon k durnil about the search for support among women 
voters we talk about it at republican national committee 
meetings we talk about it at state committee meetings and we talk 
about it with television consultants 
society has changed and we now have a majority of women in the 
work force he said we need to deal with their concerns 
the conservative rhetoric that served indianas gop so well in 
the early 1980s is giving way to talk of family issues and of 
support for governmentsponsored programs to reduce infant 
mortality or provide tax breaks for day care 
women tend to think more than men do that these are the type 
of things that should involve some governmental activism durnil 
said 
ten years ago just over half of all voters in indiana were men 
according to us census bureau estimates today more than half 
are women

five opposition candidates are taking aim at 
the governing institutional revolutionary party and campaigning for 
the presidency with a vengeance not seen before in mexico 
with 59 years of experience in winning all major elections the 
governing party known as the pri is all but guaranteed victory 
again on july 6 and another six years in the nations top office 
but opposition candidates are trying new tactics spurred by 
more competition among themselves and pri candidate carlos salinas 
de gortaris identification with mexicos economic crisis 
the conservative national action party candidate manuel 
clouthier has shadowed the pri candidate showing up in some 
of the same places 
heberto castillo of the mexican socialist party which includes 
most of the left staged land takeovers with peasants other 
opposition candidates have participated in other acts of civil 
disobedience 
and cuauhtemoc cardenas of the national democratic front 
coalition drew a crowd rivaling the governments on the 50th 
anniversary of the expropriation of foreign oil holdings by his 
father expresident lazaro cardenas 
candidates have pressured openly for more radio and television 
time from the pridominated media and complained that spots have 
been refused and stations have failed to broadcast interviews 
inhibitions have been broken and as in 68 we face a parting 
of the waters in the history of mexico castillo said on a recent 
campaign stop 
castillo a university professor was a leader of the 1968 
mexican student movement he was jailed for 2 years for his 
activities 
running a second time for the small radical revolutionary 
workers party is rosario ibarra de piedra a congresswoman and 
leader of a human rights movement she founded the group and became 
politically active after her son disappeared following his arrest 
in 1975 
gumersindo magana a lawyer is the candidate of the 
conservative mexican democratic party 
helping ignite the campaign was cardenas who led a dissident 
pri movement to fight for election reforms barred from the race by 
the party hierarchy the former state governor accepted the 
candidacy of the authentic party of the mexican revolution 
originally a pri spinoff and two small leftist parties 
he is aided by the image of his late father one of the 
countrys most revered presidents and probably the last one whom 
blue collar workers and peasants thought they could trust 
he appeals to some who for years have felt there was little 
choice 
while the opposition field generally is stronger than in the 
past salinas de gortari also has the disadvantage of being 
identified with the countrys economic crisis as budget secretary 
until he became the pri candidate he was the economic architect 
during a time when prices outpaced wages 
he lacks the charisma that could make up for it but is 
campaigning extensively throughout the country 
because of its farreaching grassroots structure longtime 
monopoly on politics and at times alleged ballot fraud pri has 
swept every election since its founding in 1929 it also has taken 
all governorships and senate seats and most of the congressional 
and local races 
lorenzo meyer academic director of the colegio de mexico a 
graduate school says the temptation to resort to alchemy 
election fraud to keep the opposition from advancing in certain 
regions of the country is present 
but for the victory to be recognized and therefore legitimate 
it will have to be realistic he said in the weekly punto 
jesus gonzalez schmal national action congressional leader 
said a voter registration list the interior department gave the 
party last september was padded by about 25 percent with fake names 
the socialist party has called for the opposition to act 
together with operational and practical means against electoral 
fraud 
salinas de gortari has promised to respect opposition victories 
in 1982 the pri won 74 percent of the vote the six other 
presidential candidates 26 percent in 1976 the pri candidate was 
challenged only by writeins from two small unregistered parties 
the government has opened up the system to other parties and 
given them congressional seats according to the percentage of the 
votes they win 
opposition parties hope to win the presidency but the campaign 
also could help them in congressional and local races 
author jorge castaneda wrote recently of the change in the 
magazine proceso in the bleak ideological plain our country has 
been for many years the saying of mao constitutes at the same time 
a hope and a definite proof of democracy may 100 flowers bloom

i keep beating the bushes for new specific complaints but we

was listed with telephone directory assistance and the fcc said it 
was unable to obtain phone numbers for the companies or their 
owners

seen a decided change in attitude on the republican side about 
how we should approach the process of spending

early years of the reagan presidency coates said members are more 
discriminating now and willing to spend money on programs that work 
the largest childprogram increases in the house budget

million for the compensatory education program for children at

many nicaraguan exiles here have longed for years 
to return to their homeland but most say they will stay put 
despite the sudden prospect of peace there 
while a few hope to return and rebuild their lives many are 
skeptical of abandoning the security and prosperity of the united 
states for an uncertain future and question whether the 9yearold 
leftist sandinista government will honor the peace accord 
we appreciate not having to worry about whos going to knock 
on your door at 3 am said ronald lacayo who left nicaragua in 
1981 and now makes womens sportswear it would take another nine 
years to be satisfied it wouldnt happen again 
lacayo doubts he or the 15 countrymen who work for him will go 
home despite the ceasefire signed last month by the sandinistas 
and the usbacked rebels known as contras the pact provides some 
political freedom in exchange for contra recognition of the regime 
most of lacayos nicaraguan workers entered the united states 
illegally and suffered hardships for years he said 
they were living three or four families to a home but after 
working hard they have built themselves good lives said lacayo 
they have more opportunity here and none of them are eager to go 
back 
the peace agreement actually could increase nicaraguan 
immigration exiles said because it might make it easier for the 
estimated 100000 exiles in south florida to bring their familes to 
the united states 
maybe 10000 will go home said cristobal mendoza who heads 
the nicaraguan committee of the poor in exile but 50000 or 
100000 more will come in 
but even those who dont believe the sandinistas will keep their 
word or readily surrender power are confident that in the long 
run the nicaraguan people will achieve a stable democratic 
government that could draw back exiled countrymen 
the nicaraguan community in large part wants to go home 
says mendoza thats why we ask for work permits and not 
residency 
perry rivkind who heads the us immigration and naturalization 
service in miami said few nicaraguans have called his office 
interested in returning instead they fear their asylum status 
will be lost and they will be forced to leave the united states 
he said the ins here issued 32000 work permits to nicaraguans 
this year alone and about 300 more apply each week truce or not 
rivkind says he is reassuring worried exiles that they will not 
be shipped back to nicaragua in the near future despite the peace 
accord 
it will take years to review their asylum status and even if 
it is revoked they have an appeal process he said 
rivkind said the exiles many of them representatives of 
nicaraguas professional and managerial class consider the peace 
agreement meaningless because of their distrust of the sandinista 
government 
i will work day and night to keep nicaraguans here in miami 
said roberto arguello influential head of the nicaraguan american 
bankers association 
nobody will move from the city of miami and nicaraguans will 
continue to come into the united states in record numbers he 
predicted 
he said nicaragua should not expect the return of its private 
sector its professionals or even laborers until the sandinistas 
have left 
however there are a few exceptions surprisingly among the 
contras who until last month were locked in a bloody struggle with 
the sandinistas 
jorge rosales longtime spokesman for the nicaraguan resistance 
as the contras are formally known said he hopes to be home within 
a few months after the treaty goes into effect but only if the 
sandinistas respect its terms 
i will immediately go back to help my family said rosales 
people have a role to play and this is mine the more middle 
class we have the better

joe malone concedes he is letting his 
instincts overrule common sense by launching a longshot republican 
challenge to a political institution sen edward m kennedy 
but malone a state republican party official offers few 
apologies 
there are some people who are analysts in this world and they 
sit down and they look at every single number and different factor 
involved in deciding whether they want to run malone said in an 
interview last week but im the type of person who moves on 
instinct 
the former harvard football player on tuesday will formally 
announce his first bid for political office a run against the 
26year senate veteran 
malone 33 has served as executive director of the 
massachusetts republican party for the past year working the 
telephones and political functions trying to breathe new life into 
a party that claims no statewide offices and is an overwhelming 
minority in both chambers of the legislature 
malone has won high praise for loyalty a trait democrats and 
republicans alike say brought him into the race against kennedy at 
a time when the state gop is hardpressed to find strong 
challengers to democratic incumbents 
kennedy has not faced a tough reelection challenge since the 
massachusetts democrat was first elected to the senate in 1962 in 
his maiden run for office 
malone was a field organizer in massachusetts for repubublican 
presidential candidate john connally in 1980 and worked on current 
state gop chairman ray shamies two unsuccessful senate runs in 
1982 against kennedy and in 1984 against john kerry 
when shamie ruled out another run against kennedy malone 
stepped forward 
most state political observers believe malones goal is to gain 
the name recognition needed for a successful statewide run in 1990 
when the possible departure of gov michael dukakis from the state 
political scene could result in a tumultuous shakeup in state 
government 
the national gop has pledged 400000 to malone and he hopes to 
raise 600000 on his own republicans make no secret of the fact 
that they want to force kennedy to campaign at home to limit the 
time he can work for the partys presidential nominee

democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis two days before wisconsins primary is challenging 
chrysler corp chairman lee iacoccas planned closing of a kenosha 
plant that would eliminate 5500 jobs 
in a letter sent to iacocca dukakis told the automaker 
executive he had supported government financial help for chrysler 
in 1979 when the company was struggling 
in fact i felt so strongly about it that i purchased one of 
your automobiles he added i admired what labor and management 
did to save and rebuild the company and i considered you a fair 
and concerned employer 
the recent events at the kenosha plant here in wisconsin have 
changed my mind about your fairness and your concern he wrote 
a good manager does not promise or guarantee some 5000 people 
jobs and then change his or her mind dukakis wrote workers 
must be treated as partners not as replacement parts in some 
obsolete machine communities and the people in them cannot be cast 
aside when no longer needed 
he asked that iacocca keep your promise to the workers and 
community and reconsider your decision to close the kenosha plant 
the letter was released by the campaign staff of the 
massachusetts governor sunday night two days before the wisconsin 
presidential primary election in which dukakis and jesse jackson 
are considered the frontrunners 
will robinson of the dukakis campaign staff said the idea for 
the letter developed out of a meeting the governor had with local 
labor officials in kenosha saturday 
chrysler announced jan 27 it would shut down auto assembly and 
metal stamping facilities in kenosha by sept 30 state officials 
have contended chrysler officials promised last year that car 
production would continue there for five years 
jackson who has been endorsed by local 72 of the united auto 
workers union the local at the kenosha plant traveled to kenosha 
to address workers shortly after chrysler announced the plant would 
be shut down in midsummer 
last week another democratic presidential candidate tennessee 
sen albert gore jr ran a television ad that attacked the kenosha 
shutdown by chrysler 
that ad prompted chrysler to issue a statement released 
thursday by spokeswoman karen stewart saying the public would be 
better served by candidates addressing real issues such as trade 
and the budget deficit rather than exploiting unfortunate 
situations like plant closings

his mother sometimes wishes he had picked a 
different profession but jim bagian has waited seven years to fly 
on a space shuttle and hes not about to let the challenger tragedy 
dash his dream 
commercial airliners crash too bagian said that doesnt 
stop you from doing things we want to get going 
one of these days if we keep flying the shuttle well 
probably have another accident thats just life the way it goes 
you knew the job was dangerous when you took it he said 
bagian 36 a physician and engineer who became an astronaut in 
1981 learned two weeks ago that he has been selected for one of 
the shuttle crews that hope to put the space program back on its 
feet the program has been grounded since seven astronauts died 
when the challenger exploded as it lifted off from kennedy space 
center on jan 28 1986 
bagians mother rose realized her worst fears about her sons 
profession during the challenger disaster 
it brought home that it can happen she said still she 
said she knows better than to try to talk her son out of it 
karl scherzberg a longtime friend from high school and drexel 
university said he never heard bagian reconsider his commitment to 
the shuttle program im sure after the accident hes been 
thinking about the reliability of systems and equipment 
scherzberg said but there hasnt really been a difference in him 
because the accident only confirmed what he knew already about 
risk 
bagian said he may have inherited his coolheadedness and love of 
aviation from his father philip a world war ii fighter pilot 
philip bagian said his son is someone who was always at the 
top of his class in everything and may have traded security for 
the uniqueness of being an astronaut 
bagian had worked with five of the challenger crew members he 
also had been assigned to fly on the challenger in other 1986 
missions before all manned us space flights were put on hold 
if anything bagian said the challenger disaster may have given 
him more confidence because weve looked at everything again 
the accident was blamed on a flawed joint in the side of the 
solid rocket booster the side joints have been redesigned along 
with parts of the rocket booster nozzle 
bagian who is stationed at the johnson space center in houston 
has been working on the escape system and astronauts pressure 
suits 
the first of the shuttle flights on the discovery is set for 
aug 4 followed by an allmilitary crew flight on the atlantis on

republican presidential candidate pat robertson 
says he has a divine mandate to run for president and will not stop 
until he is in the white house 
robertson conceded that vice president george bush all but has 
the republican nomination assured for 1988 but said he would run 
again in 1992 
there is an enterprise the lord set me on a year or so ago 
running for president of the united states robertson told an 
estimated crowd of 3000 people at the happy church in south denver 
out of what seems to be defeat we are laying the foundation 
for a great victory for this nation it may not be in 1988 but 
i am not going to quit robertson said 
that is his plan for me and for this nation 
the former television evangelist delivered his easter message as 
democratic presidential hopeful jesse jackson prepared to preach to 
a packed congregation across town at first baptist church 
later both candidates spoke at colorado springs 
robertson and jackson spent the weekend in colorado trying to 
solidify support prior to todays caucuses when the two parties 
will begin choosing delegates to the upcoming national conventions 
democratic candidate massachusetts gov michael dukakis also 
campaigned in colorado on saturday 
robertson has conceded he has virtually no chance of winning but 
said he hopes he can influence the gop platform that will be drawn 
up at the national convention in august 
im just visiting to encourage some of the people here 
robertson said sunday i want them to know that im doing work on 
the caucuses 
robertsons remarks on sunday echoed statements he had made 
saturday while campaigning in denver i am going to be the 
champion of the christian and conservative points of view if it 
takes until 1992 to do it he told a rally of about 400 people at 
the sheraton denver tech center 
robertson who last year gave up his credentials as a southern

during his appearance at the new life baptist church in colorado 
springs robertson also told more than 1000 supporters that the

the spread of aids he said

archbishop miguel obando y bravo 
announced a oneweek delay in peace talks between the sandinista 
government and rebel forces but said the postponement was no cause 
for alarm for nicaraguans 
its sad for our people the cardinal said during mass 
sunday at the las sierritas church in managua but he said 
afterward the important thing is that during these 60 days there 
is compliance with what has been agreed upon 
a 60day ceasefire signed march 23 went into effect friday and 
the defense ministry reported no violations as of sunday 
highranking sandinista and contra representatives were to meet 
on wednesday in managua to continue discussions on a permanant 
truce but the ussupported contras sought a delay to april 12 
the contras gave three reasons for the delay 
the technical talks aimed at working out the mechanics of the 
60day ceasefire were not completed 
the sandinistas did not freed all the prisoners the rebels had 
asked for when the government freed 100 political prisoners march 
29 
the government violated the ceasefires provision for full 
press freedom in nicaragua by withholding newsprint to the 
opposition newspaper la prensa 
nevertheless contra leader adolfo calero said in a telephone 
from miami on saturday that the rebel delegation would rejoin the 
talks on april 12 
deputy foreign minister victor tinoco criticized the proposed 
delay in a letter released saturday 
however obando y bravos acknowledgement sunday that the talks 
would take place on april 12 indicated the government had accepted 
the later meeting date 
the cardinal was an observer to the negotiations that resulted 
in peace terms signed in the southern border town of sapoa 
in a technical meeting held march 2829 contra and sandinista 
officials designated five zones inside nicaragua where contra 
fighters could gather during the first two weeks of april but they 
failed to establish in detail the zones or security measures for 
the rebels 
the government blamed the contras for the delay technical 
committees from both sides are set to meet again in sapoa on 
tuesday 
obando y bravo said during mass he was satisfied with the 
progress of the peace talks adding i have a lot of hope on 
this easter sunday 
the mountains are silent enough of death a step toward 
life he said to cheers and applause from the easter worshipers

milton a caniff who for half a century took 
americans on daring adventures through the comic pages with terry 
and the pirates and steve canyon has died of lung cancer he 
was 81 
caniff who had entered beth israel hospital on feb 29 died 
sunday at his home according to a spokesman for king features 
which syndicated the strips 
caniff set a standard for realistic drawing and quickly 
enthralled depressionera readers with tales of danger in the far 
east in terry and the pirates which debuted in 1934 in the 
daily news 
he left the paper to join marshall field and the chicago sun 
syndicate in 1946 with a new hero steve canyon a fictional 
air force colonel who proved so popular he was eventually given his 
own file at the pentagon 
always attuned to what sells newspapers caniff liked to quote 
his high school art teacher in dayton ohio unless a piece of 
art inspired the viewer to part with cash money to acquire it then 
the drawing was not worth a hoot 
but his technique was among the very best and he was honored as 
the rembrandt of comic strips at an exhibition at the museum of 
cartoon art in 1985 he said he belonged to the every wrinkle 
must show school of art 
at the dayton daily news pulitzer prizewinning cartoonist mike 
peters described caniff as the grandaddy of cartoonists 
he was in the inner circle with rube goldberg al capp walt 
kelly and those guys peters said he was revered by all of us 
he had some of the best drafted strips ever done 
ted hannah a spokesman for king features said caniff continued 
to work until very near his death with his longtime assistant 
shel dorf of california hannah said a decision on the future of 
steve canyon would be made this week 
caniffs cartooning career began with dickie dare and the 
gay thirties for the associated press 
he was soon approached by capt joseph m patterson publisher 
of the news who asked for an adventure strip packed with comedy 
romance and adventure and set in the orient which patterson 
regarded as the last outpost of adventure 
by 1946 terry and the pirates was in more than 300 
newspapers and caniff was making 75000 per year but he wanted to 
own a cartoon and he developed steve canyon for which he was 
paid 2000 a week and owned the rights 
despite occasional complaints about violence steve canyon 
kept flying and fighting and early this year it was in more than 
500 newspapers around the world according to king features 
caniff was awarded the air force exceptional service award its 
highest civilian honor 
caniff was a meticulous researcher and some of the plots in 
terry and the pirates anticipated actual events in world war 
ii such as the japanese attack on the united states one of his 
memorable creations was the dragon lady who was inspired by joan 
crawford 
when a terry character named raven sherman was killed in 
1941 caniff received thousands of cards letters and flowers and 
he recalled that an elevator operator called him a murderer 
terry and the pirates was continued by george wunder until 
the strip ended in 1973 wunder died last december 
caniff was born feb 28 1907 in hillsboro ohio and by 
kindergarten was drawing recognizable human figures on scrap paper 
brought home by his father a printer 
his first job was drawing cartoons for the boy scout page in the 
dayton journal herald when he was 13 he also worked for the 
columbus dispatch while at ohio state university where he earned a 
fine arts degree 
phlebitis prevented caniff from joining the military 
it was something i always wanted to do it was like a small 
boy who dreams of catching the gamewinning touchdown or rescuing 
the heroine from the villain fortunately the strips have allowed 
me to have a close association with the military caniff once 
said 
many of his strips had touches of autobiography and his ohio 
boyhood and friends often were prototypes for characters in the 
strip recently caniff drew several weeks of strips based on his 
courtship of his future wife ester parsons at stivers high 
school they were married in 1930 
he donated most of his original material to ohio states milton 
caniff library for communications and graphic arts according to 
walter k bunge director of the universitys school of journalism 
caniff received at least three honorary doctorates including 
one from the university of dayton and numerous other awards he 
also was a founder of the national cartoonists society 
he is survived by his wife ester 
funeral services were to be announced by the frank e campbell 
funeral home in manhattan

juan gonzalez passed another bottle of 
beer to a waitress smiled and noted it was a good sign that 15 or 
so patrons were getting uproariously drunk in the dimly lit bar of 
his shabby riverside inn 
it hasnt been like this gonzalez said shaking his head 
this shows that peace is coming that we need peace that the 
people believe it will happen nowhere has the war had such an 
impact 
he said residents of this northern village have been rejoicing 
since the march 23 signing of the ceasefire agreement between the 
sovietfinanced sandinistas and the ussupplied contras 
the people have been afraid for years he said offering a 
grin that showed off his two goldcapped front teeth we all got 
happy when we heard gonzalezs rundown guest house which 
doesnt have a name is located on the banks of the winding coco 
river in the village of wiwili in nuevo segovia about 150 miles 
northeast of managua 
the hamlet located among steep hills parched from the lack of 
rain became a government fortress a few years ago as battles 
heated up 
we were well protected gonzalez said but we couldnt 
leave 
the village hosts military bases and many government supporters 
sovietmade cannons and antiaircraft guns sit atop the hillsides 
east german troop trucks stand ready almost all of the men 
civilians and soldiers tote ak47 automatic rifles 
the surrounding mountains not far from the honduran border to 
the north have been rife with contra activity since the rebels 
began fighting in 1981 to overthrow the sandinistas 
no to communism says graffiti painted on a nearby building 
the socalled pantasma highway the only route from the south 
was said to be so dangerous that even truck drivers bringing food 
and supplies feared to enter the battered hulks of army troop 
trucks mined or ambushed lie along the dirt road 
to the west the narrow mountain road from quilali offered equal 
danger of attack a plaque on the side of the road at one point 
listed the names of civilians killed when a mine blew up under 
their truck 
the only other access is by foot which offers little protection 
from ambush or by the coco river but this time of year the water 
levels are too low for river travel 
people used to whisper when they had to go to jinotega to the 
south or to quilali gonzalez said theyd make the sign of 
the cross it was terrible but just last week i started to see the 
difference 
the inn owner recalled battles in the outlying hills a few 
months ago he said the bodies of government soldiers would pass 
through daily 
i know other parts have suffered but i cant believe its as 
much as we have he said we cant stand any more 
gonzalezs teenage son has served eight months of his mandatory 
twoyear stretch 
he still has more than a year to go gonzalez signed 
maybe if there is peace 
but one customer ariel antonio garcia said we want peace 
but the contras have to surrender 
the 24yearold recounted how the national guard that operated 
under the late president anastasio somoza killed his parents and 
how he believed all the contras were related to the guards 
the sandinista revolution ousted somoza in july 1979 the 
contras with the backing of the united states began fighting 1 
years later 
about 25 miles southeast of wiwili a group of contras roamed 
freely last week under the command of a 24yearold leader 
comandante ernesto as he is known echoed garcias words about the 
desire for peace but maintained the sandinistas should have fully 
established democracy 
the young men served as an example of the deep wounds left from 
years of propaganda and battles that have killed or wounded more 
than 50000 
there have been reports by the contras that renegades among 
their troops have staged attacks in violation of the truce enacted 
march 21 at the start of the talks produced the ceasefire 
agreement 
gonzalez said there were rifle and mortar fire exchanges outside 
wiwili last week hours before the official 60day ceasefire 
started friday the only sounds along the river were of barking 
dogs crickets and roosters 
but a little more than an hour after midnight the sound of an 
ak rifle was heard it came again about a halfhour later 
it was probably just someone who had too much to drink a 
resident said the next morning

teenagers may be more resistant to the virus 
that causes aids than other age groups but they have no better 
success in fighting the disease once they get it according to 
research cited in a published report 
three recent studies have indicated that teens who are infected 
with the aids virus are likely to remain free of the disease for 
longer than adults or infants the new york times reported in its 
sunday editions 
the times cited three recent studies of hemophilia patients who 
have become infected with the aids virus 
although the results are preliminary everything is pointing 
in the same direction said dr edward gomperts of the childrens 
hospital of los angeles it is striking 
dr james goedert who is conducting a study at the national 
cancer institute said aids could resemble chicken pox measles and 
other diseases that are more severe in adults than children 
whatever controls aids in children and teenagers really needs 
to be pursued he said it may have important implications for 
treatments and vaccines 
in the national cancer institutes study of 89 hemophiliacs in 
hershey pa 35 percent of the adults had symptoms of aids seven 
years after their infection compared to only 10 percent of those 
who were infected as teenagers 
in a study gomperts is conducting at childrens hospital 
researchers have been keeping track of 30 adult hemophiliacs and 90 
adolescents and children who were infected with the virus in the 
early 1980s so far five of the adults but only two of the 
adolescents and children have contracted acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
in the third study the centers for disease control in atlanta 
also found greater resistance to the disease among teenage 
hemophilia patients than among adults dr janine jason said 
aids is spread most often through sexual contact contaminated 
needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood 
products and from pregnant women to their offspring 
as of march 21 57024 us cases have been reported to the cdc 
of those 31836 or 56 percent have died

palestinian protests and israeli crackdowns in the occupied 
territories that have left more than 135 arabs dead

catholic district of west belfast after they were beaten by 
mourners heading to the burial of an ira guerrilla 
runcie said in his easter sermon that christs death was a 
dark death as dark in the cruelty and hatred which attended it as 
were the deaths of those two young soldiers in belfast a fortnight

give hope for an end to northern irelands sectarian violence

the carter administration scuttled a 1980 plan to 
swap military parts for the 52 american hostages in tehran when it 
began to doubt that its iranian gobetween had his governments 
backing a newspaper reported 
newly declassified documents mostly carterera cia and state 
department memos provide the first detailed account of president 
carters efforts to extricate the hostages before the 1980 
election which ronald reagan won by a landslide the miami herald 
reported sunday 
the documents were turned over to rep john conyers dmich 
chairman of the house judiciary criminal justice subcommittee as 
part of his investigation into whether reagans 1980 campaign made 
a secret armsforhostages deal with iran 
under the reagan administration the us sold arms to iran in 
exchange for the release of american hostages held in lebanon 
funds from the sale were diverted to contra rebels at a time when 
such aid was banned by congress 
president carter considered offering 10 million in military 
spare parts for the 52 americans held hostage at the us embassy 
in tehran according to the herald 
however his administration backed away from the plan after 
deciding that arms dealer houshang lavi did not have the backing of 
abolhassan banisadr then president of iran the newspaper 
reported 
lavi an iranianborn resident of long island ny became 
involved with the carter administration after first contacting the 
campaign of independent presidential candidate john anderson the 
documents gave no indication whether the reagan campaign was 
approached 
the papers include cia memos to carters national security 
council chief david aaron and state department memos by thendeputy 
assistant secretary harold saunders 
one of the cia memos dated oct 3 1980 mentioned a 
conversation between an unidentified agency officer and lavi in 
which lavi offered to make the hostage exchange and handed over a a 
sevenpage list of f14 parts 
lavi wished to arrange the delivery to iran of 8 to 10 
million of f14 spare parts the memo said adding he would 
arrange the swap of all the hostages upon the delivery of the spare 
parts and us agreement to unfreeze iranian assets forgive 
claims against iran and stay out of internal iranian affairs 
the cia officer recommended against pursuing the offer 
the memos indicate carter officials ended contacts with lavi on 
oct 19 1980 after a foreign ambassador in tehran reported that 
banisadr had not been aware of lavis offer 
wlstv in chicago reported on oct 15 1980 that 
armsforhostages talks were under way and a 1984 congressional 
investigation concluded the leak came from a highly placed member 
of the us intelligence community associated with the reagan 
campaign

four more soldiers jailed in plots 
against president corazon aquino were missing following the weekend 
escape of the leader of an august coup attempt the military said 
today 
chief military spokesman col oscar florendo also denied that 
troops had raided a vacation home of opposition sen juan ponce 
enrile in connection with the nationwide search for former lt col 
gregorio gringo honasan 
honasan 39 leader of the aug 28 coup attempt and 14 guards 
fled a prison ship in manila bay before dawn saturday aboard two 
rubber dinghies he had been confined there since his arrest dec 9 
for the attempted coup that left at least 53 people dead and 
hundreds wounded 
florendo said three officers and one enlisted man jailed in 
connection with the august attempt and another in january 1987 were 
missing from the detention center at villamor air base 
florendo claimed however the four apparently fled because of 
family problems and their escape was not related to the honasan 
incident 
an earlier report by a manila newspaper citing an unidentified 
air force officer put the figure at nine soldiers who had escaped 
military officials said earlier that troops sunday raided 
enriles vacation house in batangas province southwest of manila 
as part of a search of a seaside vacation resort but florendo 
denied enriles house had been raided 
enrile told a radio station today he had heard of the raid and 
charged the government was acting illegally by entering homes 
without search warrants 
honasan served as chief of security at the ministry of national 
defense when enrile was defense chief enrile was fired in november 
1986 after an alleged coup attempt by his followers 
manila newspapers have reported that leaflets were circulating 
in military camps calling for the overthrow of the government the 
leaflets allegedly were from honasans reform the armed forces 
movement the papers said 
florendo said a nationwide search was under way for honasan but 
that raids so far had failed because either we were too late or 
perhaps the information was not so accurate 
defense secretary fidel ramos today told reporters the military 
was investigating all angles of the incident including 
alleged foreign intervention in the escape of honasan ramos did 
not elaborate 
leftist rep venancio garduce has charged that americans may 
have helped honasan escape to pressure the government as it begins 
talks with the united states this week on the status of us 
military bases in the philippines 
presidential sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
mrs aquino had demanded a fullscale investigation into the 
honasan escape because she did not believe it was simply a result 
of negligence 
the skipper of the prison ship was arrested saturday but the 
sources said mrs aquino believed others in the chain of command 
should be punished 
mrs aquino told a student group on sunday that her government 
was stable enough to withstand any new coup attempt and that 
honasans escape does not in any way discourage us in what we set 
out to do 
the government has survived about six major coup attempts and 
conspiracies since mrs aquino took office on feb 25 1986 
investigators said honasan and the others fled the prison ship 
aboard rubber dinghies and came ashore near the folk arts center a 
few hundred yards from the headquarters of the philippine navy 
they then boarded seven cars which had been waiting for them 
investigators said 
officials said honasan left behind a note when he fled the ship 
saying he was escaping because the struggle for a better afp 
armed forces of the philippines must go on 
honasan played a key role in the feb 22 1986 
civilianmilitary uprising that toppled president ferdinand marcos 
and brought mrs aquino to power but honasan later accused mrs 
aquino of weak and inept leadership in the face of the 19yearold 
communist insurgency

after evoking emotional responses 
from large crowds across much of colorado jesse jackson is hoping 
to translate this commitment to massive turnout in statewide 
caucuses today and wisconsins important primary a day later 
the democratic presidential hopeful flew back to milwaukee late 
sunday to resume his wisconsin campaigning after two days in 
colorado where he drew crowds that numbered in the thousands so 
large they spilled out of churches hotel rooms and even an airport 
hangar where he spoke 
jackson also said he hoped soon to have a full report from a 
friend whom he had sent to meet with panamas military strongman 
manuel antonio noriega jackson had sent a message to noriega last 
month calling for him to leave the central american country 
jackson said he was willing to do what he could to encourage 
noriega to leave but that he had not offered to mediate the 
dispute thats too strong a word he said 
he said he had sent a friend cirilo mcsween of chicago who 
once lived in panama to meet with noriega i do not have an 
official response yet jackson said 
jacksons big crowds came as his campaign reported its biggest 
fundraising success ever 21 million during march three times 
the amount of his best previous month 
he capped his easter weekend campaign with a rally at the 
colorado springs airport he was greeted by some 1500 people 
crowded into a large hangar where some climbed on steel beams 
along the walls children sat on three small planes lining the 
rear and scores more stood outside unable to get in 
they shrieked when he entered shouted his name in unison and 
pressed to touch him when he was finished jackson seemed touched 
by the outpouring 
this excitement in this place today and in greeley pueblo 
and aspen yesterday denver and now colorado springs today 
wherever we go hope is speaking across our nation jackson said 
looking at the mix of white black and hispanic faces your 
presence is a source of inspiration 
jackson the black civil rights leader and minister preached 
easter sermons at a predominantly white baptist church in denver 
he invoked the memory of martin luther king jr on the eve of the 
20th anniversary of his death and used the symbolism of easter and 
the renewal of hope in describing the end of president reagans 
administration 
some 1500 people jammed inside the church and another 1500 to 
2000 were outside jackson then was greeted by another 1000 to 
1500 people inside and outside a jammed catholic church in a 
predominantly hispanic neighborhood where people lined the street 
for a block later he spoke to 3000 or more people in denver 
auditorium arena mixing calls for compassion for the poor with 
criticism of reagan 
a day earlier jackson had drawn large crowds too including some 
2000 for an outdoor rally in pueblo the same city where rival 
michael dukakis drew a crowd estimated at 300 
we must translate this commitment to massive turnout at the 
caucuses tomorrow night jackson told the arena crowd 
sitting in the congregation for his sermons were former 
presidential candidate gary hart and his wife lee and denvers 
politically embattled hispanic mayor federico pena 
support from hispanics is considered important in colorados 
caucuses as they make up at least 12 percent of the democratic 
vote and their neighborhoods often have high turnouts jackson

more than 200 people were arrested following a 
bloody march 5 independence protest in tibet but most have been 
released the panchen lama tibetan buddhisms no 2 leader said 
today 
it was the first time an official figure has been given for the 
number of arrests linked to the demonstration during which 
thousands of tibetans stoned chinese armed police and burned 
vehicles to protest more than 37 years of chinese communist rule 
foreign reporters have not been allowed into tibets capital 
lhasa since the protest but western travelers there have reported 
widespread arrests with estimates ranging up to 1000 
the panchen lama speaking at a televised news conference also 
said five people died during the violence including one policeman 
a tibetan monk hit by stones two lay tibetans shot by police in 
selfdefense and a layman who later died in the hospital of 
injuries 
the western travelers quoted tibetans as saying 21 tibetans and 
three chinese were killed official reports mentioned only the dead 
policeman and the panchen lama last week told reporters only of 
the four immediate deaths 
the panchen lama second only to the exiled dalai lama in the 
tibetan buddhist hierarchy supports chinese rule in tibet and is 
vicechairman of the standing committee of the national peoples 
congress chinas legislature 
although his account of events march 5 spoke of fewer 
protesters casualties and arrests than the unofficial western 
accounts it showed larger scale unrest and a heavier crackdown 
than the official media 
he confirmed that several thousand tibetans took part in the 
protest compared to earlier official accounts of only a few 
separatists 
the panchen lama said more than 200 people were detained during 
and after the protest for interrogation and that most had been 
released he did not give specific figures 
he said only three were formally charged although he did not 
specify what charges 
they will be sentenced according to their crimes and according 
to the law he said speaking in tibetan in the great hall of the 
people 
the panchen lama also said several people were detained on 
suspicion of involvement in the slaying of the policeman who was 
beaten and pushed from a window 
the march 5 protest was the fourth against chinese rule in lhasa 
in five months on oct 1 thousands of tibetans led by buddhist 
monks stormed and set fire to a police station in lhasa at least 
14 people died 
smaller groups of monks protested sept 26 and oct 6 
the government has said more than 80 people were arrested in 
connection with the three earlier protests and 15 remain jailed 
all the protests have been led by tibetan buddhist monks loyal 
to the dalai lama who was both religious and civil ruler in tibet 
before the chinese communist takeover in 1950 the dalai lama fled 
to exile in india in 1959 following a failed antichinese uprising 
china maintains it has held sovereignty over tibet since the 
13th century tibetan independence advocates say the remote 
himalayan region enjoyed de facto independence for most of that 
time 
the panchen lama while upholding chinas claim to sovereignty 
has called in recent months for greater regional autonomy and an 
end to policies under which religion the center of tibetan daily 
life was virtually banned during the 1960s and 1970s

on sapelo island one of the leastdeveloped 
barrier islands along the atlantic coast residents drive a fleet 
of battered old cars with no licenses tags or insurance or 
police 
theres no need for patrolmen because community leaders keep the 
peace and resolve disputes they once banished a man to the 
mainland for fighting 
its kind of a selfdisciplining community they help resolve 
their own problems without having a police force said cv 
waters regional supervisor for the state department of natural 
resources which manages the island 
but the quiet lifestyle that thrives among the stands of oak 
pine and salt marshes may be threatened by a state plan to boost 
tourism 
the resources department plans to buy a 50passenger tram to 
bring tourists from the mainland this summer to see the shabby 
remains of an old plantation and learn about the history of the 
island and the value of marshes and dunes 
the department however says it will keep visitors away from 
hog hammock whose 75 residents live in a cluster of wooden houses 
set amid stands of oak pine and palmettos most are descendants of 
slaves 
sapelo the fourthlargest of the 12 barrier islands along the 
georgia coast lies about halfway between south carolina and 
florida ten miles long and nearly three miles wide its 16000 
acres include 10600 acres of high ground and 5400 acres of salt 
marsh 
the state owns the island except for 434 acres that make up hog 
hammock according to legend hog hammock was named for sampson 
hog an early resident a hammock is a piece of elevated ground in 
a swampy area 
the islands 50 other residents either work for the university 
of georgias marine institute a leader in marine and estuarian 
research or the state resources department 
hog hammock residents prize their simple lifestyle 
its a beautiful place its quiet and peaceful viola 
johnson said in a recent interview at her back steps where a group 
of stray cats were sunning themselves 
the average age of island residents is 61 so many are retired 
most of those who continue to work have island jobs with the 
resources department or the university 
tourists wont change life on sapelo island said waters of the 
natural resources department 
most of the time theyll see shore birds deer and turkey

palestinians mounted a general strike today to 
protest the visit of secretary of state george p shultz who was 
trying to persuade prime minister yitzhak shamir to accept an 
international peace conference 
hospital officials said an 18yearold palestinian was shot to 
death and another 18yearold was wounded during west bank unrest 
that accompanied the general strike 
the fatality brought to 137 the number of arabs who have died in 
four months of antiisraeli protests one israeli soldier has been 
killed 
after meeting with shamir and foreign minister simon peres 
shultz told reporters his talks focused on the content of 
prospective arabisraeli talks rather than the procedure of 
arranging a meeting 
the encouraging part about it to me was that we have now 
engaged in this initiative on the important aspects of its content 
namely the direct facetoface negotitions said shultz 
streets in the towns of the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
were nearly deserted today and shops shuttered after an underground 
plo leaflet called for a general strike and three days of protests 
to coincide with shultzs visit 
hospital officials said mohammed abed maadi al zaidan was shot 
in the chest and died during a demonstration in bani naim a west 
bank village near hebron 
in nablus hospital officials said an 18yearold palestinian 
was wounded in the thigh by army gunfire during a protest at the 
balata refugee camp the army said a border policeman opened fire 
during the protest wounding an arab in the leg after being 
attacked with an ax the camp was placed under curfew 
about 600 police were deployed in jerusalems old walled city to 
prevent clashes between moslems and a militant jewish group that 
tried to enter and pray in the al aqsa mosque complex 
the mosque one of islams holiest shrines is built atop the 
site of the ancient jewish temple destroyed by romans in 70 ad 
the temple mount the national symbol of our people is in 
the hands of our enemies read a banner carried by 50 members of 
the jewish group known as the temple mount faithful they were 
turned back at the entrance ramp by 30 police officers 
anwar khatib deputy head of the 30member islamic supreme 
council which administers the moslem shrines said if the jewish 
group entered the complex moslems would be forced to defend 
themselves 
a hebrewlanguage leaflet circulating in the west bank town of 
nablus called on israeli soldiers to desert 
between jerusalem and the twin cities of ramallah and el bireh 
there was virtually no traffic on the roads and the only open store 
was a bakery bakeries were exempted from the general strike call 
in the gaza strip cars also stayed off the road today except 
for un vehicles and israeli army trucks and jeeps outlawed 
palestinian flags flew from many rooftops and utility poles 
rashad al shawwa the deposed mayor of gaza city said the city 
had joined the strike and said israeli soldiers had closed gasoline 
stations and bakeries and may have turned off electricity 
electricity has been cut off from the town altogether we 
dont know if this is another punishment al shawwa said in a 
telephone interview the closing of bakeries will definitely lead 
to a food shortage 
shultz in an interview sunday night with israeli journalists 
said he intended to reassure shamir that he would not allow an 
international conference to impose terms of a settlement on israel 
we are going to do things together shultz said the 
conference would have no authority to impose a solution and would 
have no authority to veto an agreement reached by the parties 
the plo rejected the us proposal that calls for talks on some 
palestinian selfrule to start on may 1 and on the overall 
settlement in december in a statement issued in tunis the plo 
demanded a role in peace talks 
the ploaffiliated underground leadership called in a leaflet 
last week for a general strike today to protest the shultz visit 
nobody from the arab world can say yes if the plo says 
no said faiz abu rahmeh a moderate lawyer from gaza whose name 
has been raised in the past as a potential nonplo negotiator 
three arabs died sunday including one electrocuted when 
soldiers ordered him to climb a utility pole and take down a 
palestinian flag the army said a spokeswoman said military police 
had started an investigation into the death of khalil jaber

only days after some of their fellow 
soldiers returned from honduras men and women from a combat 
aviation brigade prepared to leave for panama as part of a stepup 
in security for americans there 
im looking forward to it said pilot debra proffitt a 
23yearold warrant officer im a little excited itll be a 
good experience and good training 
proffitt and about 200 other members of the brigade from the 7th 
light infantry division loaded weapons and supplies onto 
helicopters to ready for their deployment starting today to the 
troubled central american nation 
the pentagon says the soldiers along with 26 helicopters 
including seven armed gunships are being sent to increase security 
for americans and us facilities in panama where gen manuel 
antonio noriega continues to resist us pressure for him to step 
down 
on sunday a panamanian military vehicle with its siren blaring 
chased the car of us ambassador arthur davis for two miles in an 
incident the us embassy termed serious 
about 10000 troops are stationed at the us southern command 
in panama according to the pentagon 
the army has said it does not expect the troops heading south to 
enter combat and the soldiers believe the american people support 
their mission in contrast to the recent honduran deployment which 
sparked widespread protests 
i think its very appropriate that public opinion is with 
us said lt col rick dodge commander of the unit dubbed task 
force hawk 
the unit is scheduled to fly today from its base outside 
monterey to travis air force base 150 miles to the northeast 
later it will join about 1100 other army soldiers and marines who 
will arrive in panama from tuesday through friday although no 
arrival date has been disclosed for the fort ord group 
army spokesman paul boyce said the troops are taking all the 
types of helicopters they normally fly and train with he called 
the action a normal troop movement not an emergency deployment 
like the recent honduran mission 
dodge said his pilots ground crews and air crewmen are armed 
and prepared for any of a number of missions they have trained for 
including transporting troops evacuating civilians and other 
military operations 
we normally deploy with what wed go to war with he said

secretary of state george p shultz reopened 
talks today with prime minister yitzhak shamir with a pledge the 
united states would oppose a palestinian state and any effort to 
force israel to return to its pre1967 borders 
the twohour meeting at shamirs office launched shultzs second 
shuttle visit to the middle east in a month and a new attempt to 
hold arabisraeli negotiations may 1 to provide some selfrule for 
palestinian arabs 
shamir described the twohour session as a very good and basic 
discussion of the essential issues 
shultz told reporters the two leaders concentrated on the need 
for direct negotiations between israel and the arabs and how they 
might be structured 
shamir spokesman avi pazner said the meeting was held in a 
friendly spirit but that differences remained over the 
usproposed international conference and shultzs meeting last 
month with two arabamerican members of the palestine national 
council the legislative arm of the plo 
shultz also met today with foreign minister shimon peres who 
supports the us initiative the two leaders told reporters they 
had discussed how to achieve facetoface arabisraeli negotiations 
we are not closing our eyes to the obstacles on the road that 
leads to direct negotiations but we feel we can make some progress 
on the real issues lying ahead of us peres said 
shultz said he was encouraged because the talks centered on 
direct negotiations adding thats where the emphasis needs to 
be and thats where it has been 
shamir leads the rightwing likud bloc while peres heads the 
centerleft labor party their parties are in the third year of a 
fragile coalition and the two leaders traded jobs in october 1987 
shultz returned to the region without support from israel 
jordan or syria three key parties on his plan for negotiations 
to address an overall middle east settlement in december in the 
second stage of the talks 
he emphasized on his arrival sunday that negotiations would be 
based on un security council resolution 242 which calls on 
israel to yield territory captured in the 1967 middle east war with 
egypt jordan and syria 
shultz said the resolution which also promises israel security 
applied to all fronts the resolution however does not 
specifically call on israel to give up all the territory 
asked if he agreed with peres that israel should not return to 
its pre1967 borders and that there would be no palestinian state 
shultz replied absolutely 
a reporter asked again if shultz was saying no to a 
palestinian state shultz responded no to a palestinian state 
no to a return to the borders 
israel relinquished the sinai peninsula to egypt as a part of a 
1979 peace treaty but shamir is reluctant to give up the west 
bank which jordan occupied from 1949 until 1967 when israel 
captured the territory in a war 
shultzs visit comes after four months of rioting in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip that has killed more than 135 
arabs and one israeli soldier 
shamir in a tour of the west bank on sunday questioned whether 
the arabs were ready to deal with israel shamir said he was 
skeptical about all the prophecies that the talks will have some 
kind of result a breakthrough 
shultz also will meet with peres and defense minister yitzhak 
rabin 
in tunis meanwhile the plo reaffirmed its rejection of the 
us plan 
the palestine liberation organizations executive committee 
issued a statement sunday saying the palestinian people were 
unanimous to thwart the dangerous american plan 
the just and global solution must be based on the achievement 
of the national right of the palestinian people under the 
direction of the plo its sole legitimate representative the 
statement said 
the ploaffiliated leadership of the palestinian uprising called 
for a threeday strike beginning today on the west bank and in 
gaza and barred palestinians from meeting shultz during his 
fiveday trip to the region the strike closed stores throughout 
the territories today 
in the television interview on sunday shultz defended his 
meeting last saturday in washington with edward said and ibrahim 
abulughud two american professors who are members of the 
palestinian national council 
they are not members of the plo shultz said the council is 
the legislative arm of the plo movement to establish a state on 
israeli territory 
shultz described the two council members as americans who are 
ethnic palestinians and whose aspirations deserve a us 
hearing 
shultz is looking on this trip for a positive reply to the 
twostep plan for negotiations he presented a month ago to arab and 
israeli leaders

the indian government paid sri lankas 
top tamil separatist leader to ensure his cooperation in an accord 
intended to end the rebels war against the dominant sinhalese the 
indian ambassador said today 
ambassador jn dixit said said velupillai prabhakaran leader 
of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam requested the money at 
meetings in new delhi last july 
prabhakaran said the money would make up for taxes that had 
been paid to the militia by people in jaffna the tigers main 
stronghold in northern sri lanka dixit reported 
india agreed to it and some money was paid said dixit 
the tigers since then have rejected the peace accord signed by 
prime minister rajiv gandhi of india and president junius r 
jayewardene of sri lanka last july 29 
indian forces sent to enforce the accord have been fighting the 
tamil rebel militia in the island nation since last october more 
than 400 indian soldiers and more than 1000 militiamen have been 
reported killed 
the indian post newspaper reported the payments on sunday and 
dixit confirmed the story he said he did not know the amount but 
added enough money was given him to take care of his requests at 
that point in time 
the post quoted an unidentified tiger spokesman as saying the 
agreement with india was for 384600 a month but that no payment 
was made after the first month when the tigers already were 
criticizing the peace accord 
gandhi signed the accord after trying for nearly three years to 
mediate a peace settlement between the tamils and the government 
dixit said prabhakaran and gandhi met in new delhi before the 
signing of the accord dixit said prabhakaran then asked for the 
money and for allowing his men to keep some arms to ensure his 
security 
the tigers did not sign the accord but agreed to give up almost 
all their arms the accord calls for disarming the rebels in 
exchange for sri lanka granting more autonomy to tamils 
the rebels have been fighting since 1983 for a separate tamil 
nation in sri lankas north and east tamils who make up 18 
percent of the islands 16 million population say they suffer 
discrimination from the sinhalese who control the government 
most tamils are hindu and most sinhalese are buddhists india a 
majority hindu nation became involved at the request of its own 
large tamil minority

state police today expanded into ohio 
and pennsylvania a manhunt for three convicted murderers who 
escaped from the maximumsecurity west virginia penitentiary 
the three inmates were serving life sentences without 
possibility for parole and were housed separately in cells in the 
same prison wing said jerrie clutter secretary to warden jerry 
hedrick two of them had records of escape attempts 
the inmates were noticed missing during a 1015 pm sunday cell 
check clutter said they were still at large at midmorning 
a heavy rain hampered the search effort as state police in west 
virginia ohio and pennsylvania as well as marshall county 
sheriffs deputies and local authorities combed the rural northern 
west virginia countryside for the inmates clutter said 
but authorities this morning started lifting some of the 
roadblocks set up throughout marshall and neighboring counties 
including on bridges over the ohio river just west of the prison 
and on roads into pennsylvania which borders the county to the 
east she said 
one of the inmates was believed spotted in yorkville ohio 
about 20 miles north of the prison clutter said 
the men apparently slipped out through an unused portion of the 
aging prison said west virginia corrections commissioner av 
dodrill 
prison clothing was found in the building and the outside gate 
in front of the wing was cut open clutter said 
the old administration building has been closed several years 
we dont use that building and they somehow got into there were 
not sure exactly how dodrill said 
it obviously was wellplanned therefore we have got to assume 
plans were also made for the outside once they got out he said 
the prison was locked down following the escape said deputy 
corrections commissioner bill whyte 
the prisoners are being retained in their cells until such 
time as the warden is comfortable that there are no other inmates 
involved assisting these prisoners in their escape he said 
the escapees were identified as bobby stacy 35 david williams 
28 and tommie mollohan 45 clutter said they were considered 
dangerous but were not known to be carrying weapons clutter said 
stacy formerly of columbus ohio was convicted in 1982 for the 
murder of huntington police officer paul harmon who was shot five 
times with his own service revolver at the time of the killing 
stacy was on bond after being charged with shooting a huber 
heights ohio police officer with a sawedoff shotgun 
stacy once vowed to kill a cabell county circuit judge and 
prosecutor who handled his case huntington police lt joe walker 
said 
following the escape a guard was posted at the home of a 
columbus woman who testified against stacy police there said 
mollohan was convicted of robbing and then killing a brounland 
grocer in 1973 mollohan at the time had escaped from a florida 
prison and also was wanted in georgia and north carolina on armed 
robbery charges 
williams was convicted of the december 1980 murder of a marytown 
resident found bludgeoned to death in his burned home he was 
caught trying to scale a prison wall at moundsville in 1983 after 
learning that his mother was seriously ill 
the massive stone block penitentiary houses maximum security 
inmates and was the site of a bloody new years day 1986 riot in

jesse jackson is the best candidate seeking a presidential 
nomination but that he could not win because of his radical views 
the washington times reported nixons comments in todays 
editions from an exclusive interview this weekend at the former 
presidents home in saddle river nj with the newspapers 
executive editor arnaud de borchgrave 
hes the best candidate and one of the very best of the entire 
century for either party nixon was quoted as saying 
jacksons problem is not the messenger its the message 
hes expressing a deepfelt radicalism or liberalism whatever you 
want to call it which may be a majority in some areas but is a 
minority in the country as a whole nixon said 
and if he is nominated it goes without saying he cannot win 
but everyone is overplaying the fact that he would be a liability 
because he is black nixon said that is simply not true 
jackson would be a liability because his views are radical 
he said jackson is the only interesting candidate in the race 
either republican or democrat and that regardless of what 
happens jackson has established himself as a force to be 
reckoned with in his party and in this country i disagree with 
jesse jackson but i respect him brilliant campaigner 
but nixon said jackson would have to think long and hard 
before he would even consider to be no 2 because even though the 
democrats are probably going to lose anyway he would certainly be 
blamed because he was black 
nixon who resigned in 1974 in the wake of the watergate 
scandal also discussed foreign policy extensively with the times 
editor 
nixon recommended that the next president draft former 
secretary of state henry kissinger who also served as his 
assistant for national security affairs as a mideast peacemaker 
with a mandate to find a solution to the problems in the region 
within one year 
kissinger should talk with palestine liberation organization 
chief yasser arafat nixon said you cant make a deal with him 
nor can you make one without him he added 
nixon also said everyone should quit being taken in by this 
line that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has changed soviet 
goals he has done no such thing 
he cited a speech given by gorbachev last october for the 70th 
anniversary of the communist revolution as proof that the soviet 
leader still has the goal of marxist world domination he quoted 
gorbachev as saying seventy years ago we parted with the old 
world rejecting it once and for all we are moving toward a new 
world the world of communism we will never turn off that road 
on the subject of nicaragua the former president said the 
united states should quarantine the central american nation if 
soviet aid to the sandinistas does not end and the regime continues 
to pose a threat to central america

daughters died in a house fire the woman apparently set because she 
was distressed by marital problems police said 
the body of mitsue sakai 28 was found early sunday in a 
bedroom along with those of her daughters seira candy sakai 5 
and rina stephanie sakai 4 
the three are believed to have died from smoke inhalation from 
the fire which was set in the living room sgt larry kurtz said 
based on physical evidence found at the scene and interviews 
with witnesses it is believed the suspect mrs sakai 
intentionally set fire to the house she was extremely distraught 
over marital and family problems kurtz said 
some friends of the family speculated that the apparent 
murdersuicide may be a case of oyaku shinju a japanese 
tradition in which parents planning suicide believe they also must 
kill their children so they will not be orphans 
mrs sakai who moved to the united states from japan about 
eight years ago and her husband hideo were described by 
acquaintances as quiet and hardworking people 
with her husband they were like ships in the night said 
neighbor barry rivard theyd kind of pass 
mrs sakai worked at the mitsuyoshi japanese restaurant in 
anaheim and her husband is head chef at the amagi japanese 
restaurant in buena park 
yoshikazu suzuki owner of the amagi restaurant said the couple 
had met at his restaurant about seven years ago when mitsue worked 
there as a waitress 
she worked until 1030 pm and sakai arrived at the home about 
230 am and was questioned by police neighbors said 
if she lost hope or something she cannot let the children 
live suzuki said i know of many cases in japan like that 
an estimated 300 cases of oyako shinju are reported each year in 
japan authorities said although the practice is illegal in japan 
its considered an honorable way to die and lingers in the culture 
according to mamoru iga a professor of sociology at california 
state university northridge 
the tragedy recalls the case of fumiko kimura a japaneseborn 
woman whose two young children died after she walked into the sea 
with them at santa monica beach in 1985 her motherchild suicide 
attempt was carried out in shame over her husbands adultery mrs 
kimura pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was placed on 
five years probation

a leader of the 5500member 
shipbuilders union at bath iron works said the workers should not 
have rejected the shipyards proposed threeyear contract 
it should have gone through because i dont feel theyre going 
to offer any more in august said ray ladd president of local 6 
of the industrial union of marine and shipbuilding workers of 
america 
before the contract vote the company opened its financial 
records to accountants hired by the union a move ladd hailed as 
a major breakthrough 
the proposal which offered three annual 25 percent wage 
increases and the phaseout of a twotier pay system that gives less 
money to new employees was rejected saturday by a margin of 
roughly 32 ladd said 
however the unions existing contract doesnt expire until aug 
14 leaving time for renewed negotiations this summer 
biw maines largest private employer had invited its unions to 
open contract talks early this year in hopes of improving its 
ability to compete for new shipbuilding contracts 
the shipyard lost four of five navy cruiser contracts in 
february to rival ingalls shipbuilding of mississippi 
duane d fitzgerald biws executive vice president issued a 
statement after the contract vote saying management officials were 
disappointed with the result but believe the process was 
constructive and informative 
we do not regret having made the effort fitzgerald said 
ladd blamed the rejection in part on members desire for bigger 
pay hikes and a swifter end to the twotier wage system 
under the current contract for local 6 new employees have been 
paid about 3 less an hour than veteran workers the rejected 
proposal would have phased out the twotier system in april 1990 
local 7 representing 393 clerical and technical workers 
overwhelmingly approved a new threeyear contract a week ago

the supreme court today refused to block the 
federal trade commission from investigating allegedly 
anticompetitive practices of state agencies that license and 
regulate professionals 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that ftc 
investigators may subpoena members of a massachusetts board that 
regulates pharmacies in the state 
officials from 19 states joined massachusetts in urging the 
court to limit the ftcs power the state officials said the 
commission is interfering improperly with their authority 
the commission in 1985 launched its investigation of the 
massachusetts pharmacy registration board 
the board consists of six pharmacists and a public member 
appointed to fiveyear terms by the governor 
federal investigators are questioning whether three of the 
boards rules restrain competition illegally 
one rule bans advertising claims of professional superiority a 
second prohibits mailorder business by druggists and a third 
forbids socalled pickup stations that permit customers to 
pick up prescriptions at branch outlets 
the commission sought to subpoena pharmacy board members to 
determine whether the rules unreasonably restrict advertising and 
customer convenience 
a federal judge ruled that the commission has the power to 
question the board members and the decision was upheld by the 1st 
us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court rejected arguments by massachusetts officials 
that the pharmacy board is carrying out state policy and thus is 
exempt from antitrust attack the appeals court raised the 
possibility that a board composed almost entirely of pharmacists 
might be imposing private restraints rather than carrying out 
public policy 
the reagan administration supported the appeals court ruling 
justice department lawyers said the subpoenas should be enforced to 
determine whether there is a legitimate state claim to antitrust 
immunity 
but officials from massachusetts and 19 other states said it is 
a case of improper federal intrusion potentially affecting 
regulation by hundreds of state boards 
as governments exercising traditional regulatory powers to 
protect the public health and safety the states are uniquely 
qualified to testify to the importance of the question presented 
in this case state officials said in urging reversal of the 
appeals court ruling 
the states supporting massachusetts appeal are alabama 
arizona delaware hawaii idaho illinois kansas louisiana 
michigan mississippi missouri new hampshire new jersey new 
mexico north carolina oklahoma oregon tennessee and west 
virginia 
the case is monahan vs ftc 871015

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether new york citys powerful board of estimate must be 
reapportioned to meet equalvoting standards 
the court said it will hear an appeal by city officials who said 
applying the oneperson onevote rule to the governing body will 
undermine its ability to balance regional and local interests 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last october said city 
officials should set a oneyear deadline for revamping the board to 
comply with the principle of balanced representation the appeals 
court urged the city to come up with a plan within six months 
the board was allowed to function with its current composition 
in the interim 
mayor edward i koch has named a commission to propose changes 
in the city charter those changes will be put to the voters in a 
binding referendum in november 
the board of estimate is composed of the mayor the city council 
president and the city comptroller each citywide official has two 
votes on the board 
in addition the presidents of the citys five boroughs are 
members of the board with one vote apiece 
the citys population is more than 7 million with wide 
disparities in the size of the boroughs 
brooklyns population is about 22 million queens 19 million 
manhattan 14 million the bronx 12 million and staten island 
350000 
the boards responsibilities include determining the use 
development and improvement of city property negotiating city 
contracts awarding franchises and leasing property setting water 
and sewer rates zoning decisions and tax abatements 
an example of the boards power cited by the 2nd circuit court 
is determining whether and where a toxic waste dump can be located 
in the city other examples range from deciding where skyscrapers 
are built and awarding cable television franchises to granting 
permits to sidewalk cafes 
the board also may make changes in the city budget with the 
consent of the city council 
the composition of the board was challenged by three brooklyn 
residents who said their borough is underrepresented they filed a 
lawsuit in 1981 that said the boards makeup violated their 
constitutional right to equal representation 
richard d emery a lawyer representing them said the board is 
a vestige of a system of power in new york that benefited the 
moneyed interests the real estate interests 
but city officials said the board should be exempt from the 
oneperson onevote standard because it is an innovative form of 
regional government exercising local powers 
they said there is no evidence the board is unresponsive to 
the popular will or the hostage of a narrow minority of the citys 
populace there is no evidence of arbitrary whim or of 
gerrymander or of racial mischief in the composition the 
officials added 
they also said most key decisions of the board are reached 
through consensus and that revamping the composition will 
undermine home rule 
but the 2nd circuit court said the principle of voting 
apportionment based on population equality applies to local 
elections including those for members of the board 
the current board members beside koch are city controller 
harrison j goldin council president andrew j stein and borough 
presidents fernando ferrer of the bronx david dinkins of 
manhattan claire shulman of queens howard golden of brooklyn and 
ralph j lamberti of staten island

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
alaska natives who want to hunt migratory birds in the spring and 
summer 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that treaties 
between the united states and other nations generally ban the 
hunting between march 10 and sept 1 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last october ruled in 
favor of conservationists who challenged the right of the alaska 
natives to kill migratory waterfowl for food during the offseason 
the appeals court said the federal migratory bird treaty act of 
1918 limits hunting of the birds to those periods approved in 
related treaties between the united states and other nations 
the government has entered treaties with canada mexico japan 
and the soviet union 
the canada treaty imposes the strictest limits essentially 
permitting hunting only from sept 1 to dec 15 
the alaska natives particularly eskimos living near the 
yukonkuskokwim delta say the birds are an important part of their 
diet 
a sharp decline in the population of cackling canada geese 
white fronted geese pacific black brant and emperor geese has 
caused conservationists to be concerned about their survival 
the birds nest and raise their young in the delta during the 
spring and summer months and then migrate south in early september 
the alaska natives said a 1925 federal law authorizes them to 
hunt the birds when needed for food superseding the earlier 
migratory bird treaty act 
but the 9th circuit court said the earlier law still governs the 
hunting season generally the season may be extended only if 
treaties related to the act are amended to relax the restrictions 
the appeals court said 
however the appeals court stopped short of banning all 
offseason hunting of the waterfowl instead it ordered a federal 
judge to conduct further study to determine whether agreements 
between the alaska natives and the us wildlife service violate 
the treaty act 
the most recent agreement called the 1985 goose management 
plan limits hunting of the birds for food but does not prohibit it 
entirely 
the reagan administration supported the 9th circuit court ruling 
the appeal acted on today was filed by lawyers for the alaska 
natives 
the case is alaska federation of natives vs alaska fish and 
wildlife federation 871157

mormon church leaders say followers should 
examine their lives and consider whether they are following the 
basic tenets of their faith 
the challenge to renew their dedication to the teachings of 
jesus was issued to members sunday at the close of the 158th annual 
general session of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints 
while we still feel the spirit of this great conference and 
the words ring in our ears let us determine how each of us can be 
doers of the word and not hearers only said church president 
ezra taft benson in a sermon that was read by an associate 
benson 88 attended the conferences closing session but asked 
gordon b hinckley a counselor in the governing first presidency 
to read the sermon 
benson who suffered a heart attack last year and delivered two 
addresses on saturday said he was too tired to speak sunday a 
church spokesman said 
with the closing day falling on easter sunday sermons focused 
on the divinity of jesus christ and the promise that his 
resurrection and atonement offer eternal life to all who accept him 
and adhere to the churchs teachings 
mormons believe that theirs is the one true church and that 
church leaders receive revelations from jesus in his sermon 
benson said conference messages are as important as scripture 
because they contain communications from god 
more than 6000 church members attended the proceedings in the 
tabernacle on temple square and thousands more watched by live 
satellite transmission in nearly 2000 meetinghouses throughout the 
united states canada and puerto rico 
the church was founded by joseph smith a 19th century religious 
figure who said he found gold plates near palmyra ny that 
described a visit to america by jesus after the crucifixion and 
contained the true word of god he wrote what he said was a 
translation of the plates which were returned to the heavenly 
messenger who led smith to them 
on saturday leaders announced that a record 227284 converts 
joined the church during 1987 bringing total membership to 65 
million

a substantial federal 
question refused to hear arguments that the law confiscates 
landlords property by limiting yearly rent increases for 
apartments to 75 percent 
the law covering buildings constructed before 1947 was 
challenged by owners of manhattan apartment buildings converted to 
cooperatives in the early 1970s 
tenants in the buildings who chose not to buy their apartments 
were allowed by law to remain as renters and have been subject to 
annual rent increases of 75 percent since then 
the landlords said the increases limit their rate of return on 
the property to approximately 1 or 2 percent even though real 
estate values in new york city have skyrocketed 
a rate of return of about 2 percent is so unreasonably low 
that it amounted to confiscation of the property the landlords 
said 
it is simply unfair and unconstitutional to select a 
particular class of property owners and force them to donate their 
property to a public purpose and make them finance a public benefit 
that should be the responsibility of the entire population the 
landords lawyers said 
their appeal also said the rent controls are in conflict with 
another provision of new york city law aimed at giving landlords an 
85 percent return on their property 
the longterm effect of the rent controls will be to discourage 
new investment in rental housing and cause deterioration of 
apartment buildings the appeal contended 
the new york state division of housing and community renewal 
defended the rent controls 
state officials said the law balances the interest of 
landlords while preventing precipitous rent hikes in order to 
prevent uncertainty hardship and dislocation to tenants 
the challenge to the new york city law was dismissed in 1987 by 
a state appeals court in a threeparagraph ruling 
the nations highest court last feb 24 upheld a rent control 
ordinance in san jose calif that was attacked as violating the 
constitutional rights of landlords the san jose law permits 
officials to consider a tenants financial hardship in deciding 
whether to grant rent increases

democrats and republicans on a house committee 
are calling for more federal spending on mental health services to 
improve a piecemeal system they say isnt meeting the needs of 
patients or those trying to help them 
drastic cuts in staff and funding have crippled efforts to 
address the problems that states and communities have in serving 
the mentally ill concludes a report adopted by all members of 
the government operations committee 
the report cites a 30 percent drop in grant money for community 
services and an 88 percent staff cut in a federal division that 
provides technical help to states and localities it says both 
spending and staff levels must be restored to pre1981 status or 
higher 
the release of the report sunday marks the first time that a 
very diverse bipartisan congressional panel has issued such a 
critical report on the federal role in providing mental health 
services said rep ted weiss dny chairman of the 
subcommittee that did the investigation 
according to the report the government is spending 73 billion 
a year on mental health services but they are often fragmented 
inappropriate ineffective or simply lacking 
in addition it said 75 percent of services to the mentally ill 
are provided in communities but outpatient and community services 
receive only 30 percent of the federal money spent in the area 
nearly 29 million americans are victims of some form of mental 
illness that requires professional treatment since the 1960s the 
trend has been to treat patients in community rather than 
institutional settings but the report cited a desperate lack of 
community services for the most severely mentally ill 
the federal government through the alcohol drug abuse and 
mental health administration was spending 606 million for 
community mental health services in 1980 the committee report 
said the amount decreased 14 percent to 5194 million the next 
year and another 18 percent to 4281 million in 1982 
by this year the amount had risen to 643 million but still 30 
percent below the 1980 level when inflation is taken into account 
the committee report said 
the national institute of mental health runs a community support 
program designed to encourage the provision of housing job 
training social services and treatment for the mentally ill the 
program has won wide praise but is severely underfunded the 
committee said 
social security disability insurance supplemental security 
income medicaid and medicare provide living and treatment funds to 
the mentally ill but the report said some victims are unable to 
cope with the complex application process in ohio for example 
only 12 percent of those eligible for the first two programs 
receive the benefits it said 
an 88 percent staff cut occurred at the nimh division of 
education and service system liaison which provides technical 
assistance to states and localities 
the report said 290 people were working at the main office and 
regional offices in 1980 but the office of management and budget 
ordered all regional offices closed and only 35 people remain at 
the main office 
administration witnesses at a hearing last year defended the 
staff and funding cuts the committee report said but the acting 
nimh director conceded that certainly additional resources might 
enrich what were doing 
committee republicans acknowledged in an addendum to the report 
that many of the problems it identified stem from a shortage of 
federal dollars 
we do not dispute the fact that additional financial resources 
would enable states and local communities to assist more mentally 
ill individuals the gop members said they said that in light of 
restrictions on federal spending new money should be spent in 
highpriority areas such as treatment of the severely mentally ill 
young adults and the elderly

a judge has ordered a photographer to 
stop showing potential customers boudoir photos that a college 
chancellors wife had made as a sexy christmas gift for her husband 
the order issued friday put an end to photographer ray 
westbrooks use of the photographs of tricia kellerman one a 
seminude picture in a display in his studios boudoir sample 
album 
mrs kellerman wife of james kellerman chancellor of the north 
orange county community college district learned last month from 
the wife of a college district employee that someone had seen the 
pictures 
kellerman went to the studio that same day and pulled the 
photographs out of the sample book westbrook called the police and 
accused kellerman of stealing the pictures the police dropped the 
case but the kellermans didnt 
they filed a lawsuit claiming their privacy had been violated 
these photographs have cost me far more than money i have 
never felt so embarrassed and humiliated mrs kellerman said in 
a sworn statement filed in orange county superior court i have 
been on an emotional roller coaster 
westbrook countered in his defense thursday that he had a 
witness who could say that mrs kellerman had given him verbal 
permission to display the pictures the photographer said it was 
necessary to display such pictures in order to get work 
he also said he would have destroyed the photos if the 
kellermans had called him to convey their concern

the defense attorney in a bizarre case of 
manacled women murder and dismemberment says he wants a jury from 
rural pennsylvania to hear the case because of the widespread 
publicity surrounding it 
gary heidnik is charged with keeping four women chained to a 
sewer pipe in a basement torture chamber and killing two others 
i want a jury from a less urban county somebody in the 
poconos would know less about the case than somebody in 
pittsburgh said a charles peruto jr heidniks attorney 
perutos first motion after the assignment of judge lynn abraham 
to the case this morning was for the outoftown jury 
i dont think there is a philadelphian around who doesnt know 
the case and want him sentenced to death the attorney said 
that motion and others are expected to take up the rest of the 
week peruto said as he and the prosecuting attorneys headed for 
abrahams chambers for the first conference on pending requests 
heidnik was arrested shortly after a woman who said she had 
been held in his basement led police to his north philadelphia 
house three halfnaked starved women were found chained there in 
the predawn hours of march 25 1987 
the limbs of another were found packaged in the kitchen freezer 
and the body of a second woman whom police say heidnik killed was 
found in a southern new jersey forest later that day 
the woman who led police to the house testified at heidniks 
preliminary hearing that one victim died while hanging by an arm 
from the basement ceiling police say heidnik then dismembered her 
body in a bathtub 
the other victim died when heidnik touched her manacles with 
electrical wires while she stood in water the woman testified 
peruto said he will argue his client was insane 
schizophrenia in its simplest form represents dual 
personality its a classic case of jekyll and heidnik he 
said 
peruto said he has documents that will prove heidnik was the 
subject of lsd tests by the us army in the early 1960s the 
tests he said aggravated his clients schizophrenia 
the pentagon has acknowledged performing chemical research with 
lsd on 741 volunteers from 1955 to 1967 in a 1981 report the 
pentagon said most soldiers suffered no significant damage as a 
result 
peruto declined to say whether heidnik would take the stand

thousands of protestant 
marchers waving british flags marched across northern ireland today 
to commemorate protestant resistance to the 1689 siege of 
londonderry ordered by catholic king james ii 
the marches of which there were at least six were peaceful as 
were the dozen marches by roman catholics on sunday commemorating 
the 1916 easter rising against british rule in what is now the 
irish republic 
the largest protestant march took place in banbridge about 25 
miles south of belfast where about 40 fifeanddrum bands and 60 
local clubs of the apprentice boys of derry paraded 
the marchers some wearing bowler hats pinstriped suits and 
carrying furled umbrellas others sporting the red white and blue 
of the british flag filled the normally quiet streets with a 
mixture of british marching songs and old favorites like waltzing 
matilda and johnny comes marching home 
smaller parades were held in belfast rathfriland gilford 
dromara and castlederg 
the fiercely probritish apprentice boys order takes its name 
from 12 apprentices who are said to have slammed londonderrys 
gates on king james army at the start of the unsuccessful 105day 
siege 
during the main address of the banbridge parade the rev hugh 
ross denounced the 1985 angloirish agreement giving the irish 
republic a consultative role in the affairs of northern ireland he 
called for the independence of the province from both britain and 
the republic 
we must take the initiative and support a policy that will 
establish ulster as a free independent state which will forever 
reject a united ireland the presbyterian minister said 
on sunday the irish republican army dashed any hopes of a 
ceasefire vowing to continue guerrilla attacks on british 
security forces until it saps the political will of the british 
government the ira statement was read aloud in belfast at 
milltown cemetery 
austin currie a prominent leader of the social democratic and 
labor party expressed hope sunday that talks between his moderate 
catholic party and sinn fein the legal political wing of the 
outlawed ira would lead to a permanent end of military and 
violent activity 
in an irish radio interview currie said draft documents were 
exchanged at the march 23 sinn feinsocial democratic and labor 
party meeting which could lead to a roundtable conference that 
would also include protestant parties and the irish government 
but martin mcguinness vice president of sinn fein the iras 
legal political arm told a 5000strong crowd at milltown cemetery 
that ceasefires werent even discussed at the talks 
the ira position on ceasefires has been on record for a long 
time no more ceasefires he said talk can take place but 
the war will go on 
sinn fein leader gerry adams told 1500 people at a march in 
londonderry that the talks with the social democratic and labor 
party are about exploring whether there can be an agreement in 
principle to an overall strategy for justice and peace 
however he said the two parties were far apart 
adams and mcguinness said they strongly opposed any solution to 
the nearly 20 years of sectarian strife in northern ireland based 
on selfgovernment for the province the only solution they 
insisted is for britain to pull out of the province where 
protestants outnumber catholics by 3to2 
if britain refuses to leave the ira statement read by 
mcguinness said it will have a price to pay a price so 
overwhelming as to force them to withdraw and leave us in 
peace 
the ira said it had a message for the british government 
we will demoralize you we will make your six counties of 
northern ireland into a millstone which will strangle you 
we will eventually defeat you our strategy is clear it is to 
sap the political will of the british government and british people 
to remain in ireland the means are by limited guerrilla warfare 
against crown forces 
in the creggan area of londonderry security forces on sunday 
defused a bomb that the ira said in a statement to belfast media it 
planted but decided not to detonate when an army patrol passed 
because children were in the area 
there was a heavy police and army presence at all the marches as 
security forces abandoned their shortlived policy of staying away 
from events attended by ira sympathizers 
the sinn fein march through west belfast was led and tailed by 
armored police land rovers with soldiers riding shotgun their 
rifles cocked police followed the marchers into milltown cemetery 
and encircled them with a number of soldiers hiding behind 
tombstones 
the milltown ceremony took place 25 yards from the spot where a 
protestant extremist killed three people at an unpoliced ira 
funeral on march 16 
the nopolicing policy ended after two british soldiers who 
drove into an ira funeral on march 19 were dragged from their car 
and killed by the ira

the supreme court today reinforced the right 
of hospitals to challenge federal regulations limiting the amount 
of money they are reimbursed for treating medicare patients 
justice anthony m kennedy wrote the unanimous opinion his 
first since joining the court feb 18 
kennedy in a case from ohio upheld the right of hospitals to 
contest unfavorable rules to a governmental agency called the 
provider reimbursement review board 
the board must hear the hospitals challenge to regulations even 
if the hospitals previously abided by the rules in their own cost 
reports kennedy said 
he said the boards required review of such challenges assures 
that medicare providers will then have the right to take their case 
to federal court if the board rules against them 
by objecting to the regulation in the first instance in 
proceedings before the board the hospitals protected their right 
to judicial review kennedy said the boards decision on 
reimbursement triggers the right of judicial review for the 
hospitals he said 
the regulation challenged by the hospitals limited their 
reimbursement for malpractice insurance premiums 
the hospitals filed cost reports for 1980 with what is known as 
a fiscal intermediary normally a private insurance company 
that accepted the governments limitations on malpractice 
reimbursement 
the hospitals then appealed to the provider reimbursement review 
board for more money but the board said it lacked authority to 
review the case because the hospitals had not challenged the 
regulation before the fiscal intermediary 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals ruled that the board acted 
properly 
kennedy said today that the appeals court ruling could deny the 
hospitals the right to a federal court hearing when they challenged 
governmental regulations 
todays decision was a victory for the bethesda hospital 
association in ohio and the deaconess hospital association of 
cincinnati 
the department of health and human services since has revised 
the formula to allow hospitals more money for malpractice costs 
the case is bethesda hospital association vs bowen 861764

a passerby found three pieces of poisoned 
chocolate near a shrine and playground but police said today that 
no one was hurt in the latest of a series of poisoned candy 
incidents since september 
a poison reaction was detected in police checks on three 
individually wrapped pieces of chocolate found sunday in the grassy 
compound of a shrine in itano in tokushima prefecture about 320 
miles southwest of tokyo said tokushima prefectural police 
spokesman sumio okuyama 
he said a passerby found the chocolates and called police a 
section of the shrine compound is used as a playground okuyama 
said 
he did not say what poison was in the candies and said police 
would not disclose who had manufactured them 
police suspect the same group or same person was responsible for 
a string of incidents in which poisoned chocolates were left on the 
ground near a playground and schools he said 
okuyama said on march 24 police found 21 chocolates tainted 
with potassium cyanide in the compound of a kindergarten in a town 
near itano 
he said poisoned chocolates were discovered in two kindergartens 
in neighboring kagawa prefecture last sept 8 and similar 
incidents were reported that month in at least three other 
tokushima schools 
okuyama would not confirm a news report that a threatening 
letter was sent last month to lotte co a candy maker based in 
tokyo demanding 320000 
in 1984 a group calling itself the man with 21 faces 
planted poisoned candy on store shelves in a bid to extort money 
from the manufacturers no one was reported hurt 
the group also kidnapped katsuhisa ezaki president of the 
confectionery firm ezaki glico and demanded a ransom of 4 million 
and 220 pounds of gold 
ezaki escaped unharmed three days later but a series of 
extortion threats against ezaki glico and at least 30 other food 
companies ensued including a demand for 800000 from glicos 
rival morinaga and co 
the man with 21 faces apparently stopped planting poisoned 
candy about two years ago although police insist no payoffs were 
made there were no arrests 
another police official of tokushima prefecture who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said investigators did not know if the 
latest plantings of poisoned candy were connected to the 1984 
incidents

former attorney general elliot richardson says 
president reagan is too willing to let his friends get away with 
things and the case of edwin meese iii is only the latest example 
reagans determination to stand behind meese as attorney general 
follows the pattern he has shown with other embattled 
administration figures richardson said sunday 
richardson who in the nixon administration held the office now 
occupied by meese said during an interview on nbctvs meet the 
press that reagan has been much too tolerant too amiable too 
willing to let his friends get away with things because he has 
somehow come to believe in them as individuals and in effect has 
looked the other way 
the resignation of two top justice department officials last 
week touched off bipartisan calls in congress for meese to quit 
meese is the subject of a nearly yearlong criminal investigations 
and the officials said the attorney generals legal problems were 
hurting the departments operations 
but two top political party leaders said sunday that the meese 
matter wont be a longterm political issue in and of itself 
i dont think it will have much impact either on the senate or 
the presidential races it will be a factor but i dont think it 
will be a major one a decisive factor sen george mitchell of 
maine a former chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign 
committee said in an interview on cbstvs face the nation 
he said the meese matter would become part of the reagan legacy 
of aides and issues that have led to investigations indictments 
and convictions in the general category of ethical breaches 
i dont think you could single out any one thing and say this 
is the decisive factor i think there will be an appeal in the 
presidential race in terms of integrity and ethics in government 
generally of which this is one factor 
sen rudy boschwitz of minnesota chairman of the national 
republican senatorial committee which finances gop candidates 
said that although there is some political liability involved 
i dont think its going to have a measured impact on the 
elections 
but rep barney frank dmass predicted on meet the press 
that the meese affair would have ramifications for the republicans 
in november he cited george bushs squirming on the subject last 
week in which bush declined to say meese should resign but said 
the attorney general should be above reproach 
richardson who resigned in 1973 rather than obey nixons order 
to fire watergate special prosecutor archibald cox called for 
meese to resign 
he should step down from that office when there are serious 
questions as to his integrity even though the proven guilt may not 
be conclusive 
he said the climate at the justice department is the worst since 
the saturday night massacre of the watergateplagued nixon 
administration in which richardson and other top officials left 
the department 
asked if meese could rightfully refuse to resign on the basis 
that he wont be hounded out of office by a lynch mob 
richardson replied 
the question isnt whether an individual can be improperly 
affected by charges or accusations that have not yet been fully 
proven the question is whether an attorney general of the united 
states should cling to office despite the impairment of his 
effectiveness that has been brought about by a situation like 
this 
however rep henry hyde rill also speaking on the nbc 
program said sunday that meese should not be chased from office 
unless hes proven guilty of something

a federal appeals court today upheld the 
espionage and theft of government property convictions of a former 
intelligence analyst who gave spy photographs of a soviet ship to a 
british military journal 
samuel loring morison grandson of the late pulitzer 
prizewinning naval historian samuel eliot morison was convicted 
in october 1985 of giving us satellite photographs of a soviet 
nuclear aircraft carrier under construction to janes defence 
weekly 
a unanimous threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of 
appeals rejected arguments by morison who worked for the navy 
that the statutes under which he was found guilty were 
unconstitutionally vague and were intended to cover classic 
spying for a foreign government rather than leaks to the press 
the defense also said the espionage prosecution violated 
morisons right to free speech and would intimidate lowlevel 
government employees from leaking information which would embarrass 
their superiors 
the mere fact that one has stolen a document in order that he 
may deliver it to the press whether for money or other personal 
gain will not immunize him from responsibility for his criminal 
act the judges said to use the first amendment for such a 
purpose would be to convert the first amendment into a warrant for 
thievery 
morison remains free on a 100000 appeal bond his attorney 
mark lynch said today from his washington dc office lynch 
said he has not seen the 4th circuits opinion and has not decided 
whether to seek a rehearing before the full court or a review by 
the us supreme court 
because morisons prosecution raised questions about the 
constitutions free speech and freedom of the press guarantees 
several news organizations including the new york times the 
washington post the wall street journal and the nations three 
major television networks filed briefs in the case 
the photos were published by janes on aug 11 1984 and later 
by other publications and news organizations 
morison a civilian employee of the naval intelligence support 
center in suitland also was convicted of the theft of the photos 
and government documents that described a may 1984 explosion at 
severomorsk the main ammunition depot for the soviet unions 
northern fleet 
morison was sentenced to two years in prison by us district 
judge joseph h young of baltimore 
prosecutors said morisons actions endangered national security 
because the photographs revealed to the soviets how a us spy 
satellite worked they also said morison leaked the photos to get a 
fulltime job with janes after doing parttime work for the 
publication while employed by the navy 
defense attorneys contended their client was trying to educate 
the public about a soviet naval buildup and that the photographs 
showed the soviets nothing they had not learned already from a 
former cia officials 1978 sale of the spy satellites operations 
manual to a soviet agent 
judge j harvie wilkinson iii agreed that first amendment 
interests in the case were significant but said the way in which 
the photographs were released threatened an equally important 
public interest the security of sensitive government 
operations 
to reverse morisons conviction on the general ground that it 
chills press access would be tantamount to a judicial declaration 
that the government may never use criminal penalties to secure the 
confidentiality of intelligence information wilkinson wrote 
the judge added that the prosecution of morison was not an 
attempt to apply the espionage statute to the press for either the 
receipt or publication of classified materials 
judge j dickson phillips jr said the espionage statutes as 
now broadly drawn are unwieldy and imprecise instruments for 
prosecuting government leakers to the press as opposed to 
government moles in the service of other countries 
however phillips said the limiting jury instruction in 
morisons case requiring proof that the leaked information was 
either potentially damaging to the united states or might be useful 
to an enemy was a sufficient remedy

the supreme court today refused to let a st 
louis airport ban all demonstrations soliciting and distribution 
of political and religious literature from its terminals 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that an airport 
terminal like a city street and sidewalk is a public forum where 
freespeech rights must be accommodated 
to date every federal appeals court that has studied the issue 
has ruled that a governmentrun airport terminal is such a public 
forum but the high court has never said so 
the justices came close last june when they unanimously struck 
down a sweeping ban on free speech at los angeles international 
airport 
saying that officials there tried to create a virtual first 
amendment free zone justice sandra day oconnor wrote for the 
court then that such regulation goes far beyond trying to ease 
congestion or disruption of traveling services 
we think it obvious that such a ban cannot be justified even 
if the airport were a nonpublic forum because no conceivable 
governmental interest would justify such an absolute prohibition of 
speech oconnor said 
the st louis case acted on today began when a fired airline 
employee unsuccessfully sought permission to protest in the lambert 
airport terminal 
jesse jamison had been employed with trans world airlines for 16 
years before he was fired in 1984 according to court records 
jamison believes his firing was discriminatorily based on his 
mental illness he has been diagnosed as a manicdepressive the 
court documents said 
after the director of the cityowned airport refused to let 
jamison protest against twa in the airport terminal jamison sued 
in federal court 
a federal judge ruled that the process by which the city and 
airport director decide who may protest at lambert airport violates 
freespeech rights but also ruled that jamisons protest could be 
barred 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals last sept 10 also ruled 
that the airports general ban on such demonstrations is 
unconstitutional and it ordered the trial judge to come up with a 
way to accommodate jamisons right of peaceful picketing 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for st louis argued among 
other things that the lower courts wrongly concluded that an 
airport terminal is a traditional public forum 
in stark contrast to parks streets and sidewalks which have 
a unique tradition as sites for assembly and debate airport 
terminals have traditionally been devoted to one purpose only to 
serve as a safe efficient and pleasant nexus for air and ground 
modes of transportation the appeal said 
therefore the lambert airport terminal is not a traditional 
public forum it added 
in other action the court 
let stand a 3 million libel award won by a cigarette 
manufacturer against cbs and a television anchorman in chicago 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the award 
one of the largest libel verdicts ever upheld on appeal violated 
the rights of the network and its newscaster 
agreed to review rulings limiting korean air lines financial 
liability for a 1983 disaster in which 269 people died the 
shooting down of a kal passenger jet over soviet airspace 
the justices said they will study arguments that the airline 
should have to face more than 75000 in damages for each death 
refused to block the federal trade commission from 
investigating allegedly anticompetitive practices of state 
agencies that license and regulate professionals 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that ftc 
investigators may subpoena members of a massachusetts board that 
regulates pharmacies in the state 
agreed to decide whether new york citys powerful board of 
estimate must be reapportioned to meet equalvoting standards 
the court said it will hear an appeal by city officials who said 
applying the oneperson onevote rule to the governing body will 
undermine its ability to balance regional and local interests 
reinforced the right of hospitals to challenge federal 
regulations limiting the amount of money they are reimbursed for 
treating medicare patients 
justice anthony m kennedy wrote the unanimous opinion his 
first since joining the court feb 18 
the justices in a case from ohio upheld the right of hospitals 
to appeal certain unfavorable regulations to a governmental agency 
called the provider reimbursement review board 
gave federal agencies more leeway in dealing with labor unions 
representing their employees 
the justices in a unanimous and unsigned opinion said a 
federal employers rules or regulations may not be challenged as 
unfair labor practices until found to have been imposed without any 
compelling need

migratory birds in the spring and summer

the supreme court today gave federal agencies 
more leeway in dealing with labor unions representing their 
employees 
the justices in a unanimous and unsigned opinion said a 
federal employers rules or regulations may not be challenged as 
unfair labor practices until found to have been imposed without any 
compelling need 
the decision whittles the power of the federal labor relations 
authority the agency created to handle disputes between federal 
employers and unionized employees in such circumstances 
the case stems from a decision by the army in 1981 to shut down 
operations at the aberdeen proving ground for three days after 
thanksgiving to conserve energy 
workers there were required to claim the time off as vacation 
days that they might have preferred to use some other time 
the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers accused the army of an unfair labor practice for refusing 
to bargain over the decision 
the flra ruled that the army failed to prove there was a 
compelling need for its vacationdays rule and ordered the army 
to negotiate with the union 
but the 4th us circuit court of appeals overturned the flra 
ruling stating that the burden is on the flra to show there is no 
compelling need for a government agencys rules before it orders 
agency bargaining with a union 
another federal appeals court had upheld the flra in a similar 
case and todays decision upholding the 4th circuit courts ruling 
resolves the conflict in a way unfavorable to the authority 
the justices said federal law clearly states that where a 
matter is covered by regulation no duty to bargain arises until 
the flra has first determined that no compelling need justifies 
adherence to the regulation 
the court said the compelling need finding by the flra 
cannot be combined with an unfair labor practices proceeding 
the case is flra vs aberdeen proving ground 861715

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the cocaine trial of john zaccaro jr opened 
today with the judge barring all but six reporters from the jury 
selection process and ordering that no information be publicly 
disclosed until a jury is chosen 
judge francis mccaffrey said he expected jury selection to last 
three days adding that any published information could unduly 
influence the jury pool 
zaccaro the son of former presidential vice presidential 
candidate geraldine ferraro is accused of selling onequarter gram 
of cocaine to an undercover policewoman the charge to which 
zaccaro pleaded innocent carries a fiveyear prison term 
he arrived in vermont district court in rutland flanked by his 
attorneys while ferraro and her husband john zaccaro sr arrived 
in a separate car and followed their son into court 
zaccaros parents pulled up swivel chairs immediately behind the 
defense table ferraro a lawyer wrote lastminute notes and 
reviewed court paperwork 
attorneys met with mccaffrey for more than an hour before the 
judges decision was announced 
mccaffrey said six of 11 reporters in the courtroom could attend 
jury selection but said they would not be able to publish the 
information until the jury was empaneled 
it is important that we get an impartial jury that is where 
you persons have become an issue mccaffrey told the reporters 
his decision he said essentially provides a compromise 
the trial opened more than two years after zaccaro a former 
middlebury college student was arrested 
the case has progressed slowly because of appeals to the vermont 
supreme court including a claim that zaccaro was singled out for 
prosecution because of his famous mother 
two weeks ago one of the challenges paid off when vermont 
district judge francis mccaffrey dismissed one of the two original 
charges against zaccaro 
but zaccaros attorneys charles tetzlaff and thomas sherrer 
lost their bid to have the case thrown out altogether the vermont 
supreme court refused to dismiss the charges last year 
zaccaro 24 was a senior at middlebury college when he was 
arrested feb 20 1986 outside a middlebury restaurant where he 
worked 
the prosecution alleges the undercover agent laura manning 
bought onequarter gram of cocaine from zaccaro at his offcampus 
apartment earlier that day 
police searched zaccaros car and said they found eight grams of 
cocaine 1600 in cash and checks and documents described as 
records of drug transactions 
the arrest came in the wake of rumors that zaccaro allegedly was 
selling drugs on campus and had earned the nickname the 
pharmacist middlebury police sgt david wemette said at the time 
zaccaro also was charged with possession of cocaine with intent 
to sell the charge thrown out because it hinged on the evidence in 
zaccaros car 
in 1986 mccaffrey said there was insufficient evidence for the 
search warrant used to obtain the items in throwing out the charge 
two weeks ago he rejected the contention of addison county states 
attorney john quinn that the charge could be proven based solely on 
mannings observations 
no more motions or requests were expected before or at the start 
of the trial quinn said friday tetzlaff declined to comment 
the case will be followed closely by students at the liberal 
arts college even though zaccaro dropped out in the fall of 1986 
said sharon harper the editor of the college newspaper the 
middlebury campus 
the case of john zaccaro opened up the administration to drug 
problems in middlebury harper said i think its important 
that people see how this case follows through so they know that 
theres a penalty for drug abuse

jury selection began today for the murder 
retrial of a man once sentenced to death for the slayings of six 
members of a farm family 15 years ago 
a federal appeals court in 1985 threw out death sentences 
against wayne carl coleman his halfbrother carl isaacs and george 
dungee and ordered new trials 
a barrage of pretrial publicity in the rural southwest georgia 
county of seminole site of the 1973 killings of the alday family 
made a fair trial there impossible the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals ruled 
isaacs accused mastermind of one of the states most notorious 
killing sprees was convicted again in a retrial in january in 
perry a small town 30 miles south of macon and given a new death 
sentence 
coleman is being retried in dekalb county superior court in this 
atlanta suburb and dungee will be retried later this year in 
columbus prosecuting attorney charles ferguson has said he will 
seek the death penalty for them also 
a dekalb county jury last month ruled coleman now 41 competent 
to stand trial despite his attorneys contention that the last 15 
years behind bars have rendered him in need of mental treatment 
superior court judge hugh lawson of hawkinsville who is 
presiding over all three retrials last month refused to approve 
public funds to hire an expert to help defense attorneys during 
jury selection he also rejected defense motions to prohibit 
prosecutors from using colemans lack of remorse against him in a 
sentencing trial if he is convicted 
a confession by coleman was presented as evidence in the first 
trial 
the three defendants escapees from a maryland prison farm were 
convicted in 1973 for the deaths of ned alday 62 his brother 
aubrey 57 neds sons jerry 35 chester 30 and jimmy 25 and

japan air lines has written the boeing co about 
defects found in two boeing aircraft types and demanding the giant 
us airplane manufacturer tighten its quality control airline 
officials said today 
they said the march 30 letter by jals president susumu yamaji 
to boeing chairman frank shrontz reported the mistaken installation 
of engine heat detectors in boeing 747s found last december and 
the discovery last month of wrong wiring in fire extinguishers in 
the cargo hold of 767s 
the letter demanded that boeing make greater efforts to achieve 
better quality control said the officials speaking on condition 
of anonymity but they stressed the letter merely was intended to 
call shrontzs attention to the problems and was not a formal 
compaint 
craig martin director of public relations for boeing commercial 
aircraft in seattle confirmed yamajis letter was received and 
said i believe mr shrontz has responded to it as we would to 
any customer but as far as a specific response i do not believe 
one has been formulated 
so far as we know the complaints were accurate martin 
said and an investigation was under way to determine how the 
mistakes occurred i think those were onetime occurrences he 
said 
the problems cited would not normally constitute safety threats 
martin said i think you could construct a scenario in which they 
might present safety problems as a matter of course no he 
said 
japanese criticism of the seattlebased aircraft maker has 
mounted since the crash of a jal boeing 747sr in august 1985 all 
but four of the 524 people aboard the plane were killed in 
aviations worst singleplane disaster 
a japanese government report last june concluded the crash 
resulted from boeings improper repair of the planes rear cabin 
wall after the aircraft scraped its tail during a landing in 1978 
boeing has acknowledged the improper repair 
in july 1986 jal became the first airline to establish a 
permanent office at boeing when it sent two inspectors to seattle 
to conduct regular quality checks on boeings assembly and 
maintenance of jal aircraft 
the officials said jal currently has 60 747 jumbo jets and 11 of 
the twinengine widebody 767s 
other airlines also send representatives to seattle while their 
jets are being manufactured martin said

one hyperactive student is greatly helped by 
ritalin so the teacher encourages the parents of others to try it 
and they tell other parents about the happy results ritalins 
success many have led to its excess some fear its now overused 
the second story in a threeday series r is for ritalin looks 
at the increased role of a prescribed drug in the nations schools 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
something new is tucked amid the workbooks pencils and 
sandwiches in an increasing number of school backpacks each day it 
is a pill no bigger than button candy prescribed to help 
youngsters get through their multiplication tables spelling tests 
and geography lessons 
the pill is ritalin a stimulant that can assist hyperactive 
children in concentrating completing their work and controlling 
frenzied outbursts that turn classrooms to chaos 
some parents describe ritalin as a godsend 
it was like the difference between day and night said nancy 
anderson a buffalo minn mother whose daughter 11 and son 8 
take the drug the first day sarah took ritalin was the first 
time she was able to read something and understand it that night 
she told me and started crying 
i cried too 
but ritalins success may be leading to its excess as many as 1 
million children may take the drug and happy endings like the 
andersons are encouraging more doctors to prescribe it sometimes 
with less triumphant results 
many doctors say superficial diagnosis and limited followup 
have led to the medicating of the children who dont need it or 
who need additional counseling to learn how to tame the confusion 
inside their minds 
i know of several communities and school districts where 
people are excessively prescribing medication for children without 
adequately evaluating them said russell barkely director of 
psychology at the university of massachusetts medical center 
barkely said these communities to the west and north of boston 
may be seeing the children once a year and renewing the 
prescription by telephone 
the five states with the highest percapita consumption of 
ritalin utah maryland georgia minnesota and michigan have 
begun investigating its use 
georgia officials alarmed by high ritalin use in suburban 
atlanta found school personnel were urging ritalin treatment on 
parents 
we looked at what was driving the marketplace and wound up 
with the conclusion that it was the school systems said andrew 
watry executive director of georgias composite state board of 
medical examiners parents were calling us with a lot of 
anecdotal information about how their arms were twisted to take the 
medication 
lavarne parker a suburban atlanta mother believes ritalin is 
used as a chemical billy club to subdue problem students she has 
filed suit against the doctor and school officials who encouraged 
her to medicate her son 
its almost like someone said weve got a pill to give a child 
who wont do what you want him to do she said 
when susan marshalls son bradley had trouble in firstgrade 
at hingham mass she sought medical help on the schools advice 
her pediatrian prescribed ritalin 
but bradley did not improve and according to his mother 
suffered from insomnia depression and a loss of appetite mrs 
marshall finally took bradley to a neurologist who found the boys 
problems were due to a hemiparesis a limited brain injury not 
treatable by ritalin 
the marshalls are suing the pediatrician 
he simply prescribed ritalin she said we were not given 
a diagnosis 
parents like mrs marshall and mrs parker claim ritalin carries 
harsh side effects from facial tics and lost appetite to 
depression and suicide their anxieties are fed by the citizens 
commission on human rights a group supported by the church of 
scientology that opposes psychiatric treatment and is conducting a 
nationwide media campaign against ritalin 
doctors and government regulators dismiss most charges against 
ritalin as exaggerated and unsubstantiated citing some 500 
research papers that mostly agree side effects are temporary and 
minimal 
manufactured by cibageigy corp and known generically as 
methylphenidate ritalin is one in a small group of drugs used to 
treat childhood behavioral disorders and narcolepsy as a class ii 
drug it is listed along with amphetamines morphine and the 
painkiller demerol as a drug with legitimate use but high 
potential for abuse 
prescribing drugs for problem children is not new the roman 
physican galen suggested opium for overactive children in the first 
century research in the 1930s indicated that treating hyperactive 
children with stimulants usually amphetamines helped calm them 
ritalin was developed in 1955 as an alternative to amphetamines 
what has changed in the last decade is the awareness some say 
overawareness of the malady that ritalin is used to treat 
known variously over years as hyperactivity hyperkinesis and 
minimal brain disfunction the syndrome is now called attention 
deficit disorder a catchall of symptoms ranging from wild 
destructive behavior to an inability to concentrate or in 
educational jargon stay on task 
researchers say 3 to 10 percent of the nations 45 million 
schoolchildren exhibit some symptoms of add 
the american psychiatric associations diagnostic bible lists 
add symptoms such as fidgeting difficulty awaiting turns at games 
blurting out answers before being called on excessive talking and 
a penchant for losing things 
while many parents would recognize some of these noisome habits 
in their children add parents say it is the intensity of the 
behavior that separates theirs from normal children 
its the constantness of it said jean conner harrison a 
west newbury mass mother who publishes a newsletter for add 
families you are trapped in it you cant take these children 
anywhere you cant get babysitters to stay with them it is so 
emotionally tough to get through this day by day 
add is the single most researched area of child psychology some 
600 research papers on the subject were published last year add 
seminars are commonly held around the country for doctors 
educators and parents 
regional diagnostic clinics have sprung up often near research 
centers in states with high ritalin use as a result more and more 
children are being diagnosed with add and treated with medication 
critics note with alarm that ritalin production has doubled 
since 1983 but the us drug enforcement administration which 
sets production levels says that statistic sheds little light on 
how many people take a drug 
a better gauge is number of prescriptions an fda report shows 
22 million prescriptions for ritalin and related drugs were filled 
and refilled in 1986 the figure does not show the number of people 
using the drug but it does indicate an increase in use the 
number is 14 percent higher than in 1983 
thats unusual said carlene baum an fda psychologist 
the average annual increase in prescriptions for most drugs is 1 
percent 
no one is certain how many of the nations children get a daily 
dose of ritalin daniel safer a johns hopkins university child 
psychiatrist who has studied surveys at various school districts 
believes 600000 to 800000 schoolchildren receive stimulant 
medication mostly ritalin 
its been going up steadily said safer and i dont see 
it going down

in 1971 11 percent of baltimore county school students were 
taking ritalin safer said by 1983 the number was up to 35 
percent 
the increase is a multiple of factors parentteacher 
satisfaction the ease of treatment and its relative success he 
said 
most maryland school districts recommend parents seek medical 
help only after teachers counselors and administrators have met to 
discuss a problem student 
we dont prescribe ritalin said robert dubel 
superintendent of the baltimore county school district all we do 
is refer children to medical help the same as we would if a child 
had problems seeing a blackboard we would tell the parents and 
they would have the childs eyes examined 
yet when baltimore county officials threatened with a lawsuit 
reviewed their policy late last year they found such a measured 
response was not always the case 
i am convinced that we probably do have some people out there 
who sidestep some of the procedures and say you have to get that 
child on ritalin said thomas farley an assistant county 
attorney 
in georgia watry the director of the medical examiners board 
tells of one school counselor who would pressure parents on a 
mass scale to use ritalin 
he told parents he was playing the percentages because it had 
helped with so many cases said watry 
late last year a special study group for the georgia department 
of education recommended school personnel be warned against 
pressuring parents to seek medication and leave diagnosis and 
treatment to medical professionals 
but often these professionals are not doing a complete job 
the american academy of pediatrics recommends extensive testing 
and discussion among doctors parents and educators before 
prescribing medication 
guidelines also stress that medication is only part of the 
solution counseling therapy tutoring even special classes for 
parents are recommended 
almost everybody in the field will say you have to do more 
than give the pill said james satterfield a los angelesarea 
psychiatrist whose research found hyperactive children responded 
dramatically better to a combination of therapy and ritalin 
weve heard about pediatricians who have said heres six 
months of prescription come back when it runs out he said 
that gives a message to parents that heres this magic pill you 
dont need any other treatment 
but some question if many of those getting treatment need it 
thomas long a psychologist and director of the national center 
for family studies at the catholic university of america believes 
doctors choose medication when counseling and different parenting 
might be enough 
we have created a society that relies on medication to solve 
our problems he said the first thing you go to when you have 
a problem is some kind of pill

each weekday morning our 7yearold son tom 
starts breakfast with a tiny white tablet he calls his daydream 
pill 
the pill has become part of our daily routine there was a time 
when my wife and i people who think twice before taking aspirin 
would have been incredulous had you told us wed be giving our 
child a behaviormodifying drug 
as tom grew into an active toddler he gave no indication 
anything was amiss we were sure he was a superstar with blond 
curls and a sturdy wellcoordinated body he was quick and good at 
everything an early walker and talker a cheerful elf full of 
eager questions 
but by the time tom was ready for kindergarten we were 
concerned he couldnt seem to keep his mind on a task he didnt 
like to play alone and he didnt stay with an activity for more 
than a few minutes 
we hoped it was just immaturity perhaps we had spoiled him 
with his quick mind and pleasing personality tom drifted 
through kindergarten we wondered why he wasnt picking up academic 
skills as quickly as wed anticipated but his school reports were 
generally good and he was having a good year with soccer and tball 
everything changed in first grade he was one of 30 classmates 
and most of the school day required independent seatwork 
we realized something was very wrong when tom began collapsing 
into tantrums of freefloating rage and frustration after school 
we were completely taken aback especially because we had high 
confidence in his small caring school 
we were mystified by our little soccer players rage at what 
was it the oversized class 
the school principal assured us that although the class was 
large the children were doing fine 
we spoke to psychologist friends about whether some deepseated 
anxiety could be surfacing 
tom himself was unable to give us any clues until one night in 
the midst of an emotional collapse he said over and over im 
dumb 
fortunately for us all toms class took a group intelligence 
test about this time toms score was so high in comparison with 
his performance that the principal called us in she wanted to do 
further testing and mentioned attention deficit a term that 
seemed to fit the child we knew 
the principal also mentioned ritalin saying she had seen 
dramatic changes in kids like tom we were appalled by the 
suggestion we give our boy a drug skeptical that this was the 
proper way to approach a learning problem 
instead we tried a highly publicized diet and spent an 
agonizing month keeping tom from many of his favorite foods ones 
with cyclamates and additives the stress of the diet increased 
toms rage and frustration 
we next urged the school to institute behavioral techniques 
such as rewarding tom for even brief periods of concentration 
these helped but only moderately and we started to reconsider 
after reading all the research we could find and considering 
the side effects such as the possibility tom would be onequarter 
inch shorter as an adult we concluded the risks of trying ritalin 
were minimal 
a factor in our decision was our own dependence on our morning 
cups of coffee which help us get going and stay focused were we 
depriving tom of the equivalent of a morning cup of coffee 
the pediatrician said tom might temporarily lose his appetite or 
have trouble sleeping none of this happened and tom was 
surpringly amenable to taking the tiny pill 
indeed tom was the first to let us know it was making some 
difference he started calling it his daydream pill saying it 
helped him control the daydreams that distracted him in class his 
teacher soon reported his behavior was improving and we saw this 
reflected in his school work 
still we couldnt be certain it wasnt just a placebo effect on 
tom and the teacher 
this year with a new teacher who shared our lingering 
reservations we withheld the ritalin for a couple of weeks 
simultaneously tom and his teacher reported he couldnt 
concentrate and urged us to return to the pill 
with the increased demands of second grade tom has begun taking 
an additional 5 milligrams at lunch occasionally when hes having 
trouble staying with his homework hell say maybe i should take 
a pill last week we filled yet another prescription at the 
pharmacy where we are now recognized as regulars 
last month tom proudly brought home a report card with bs in 
math and english and as his first ever in reading and 
spelling in categories such as deportment handwriting and follows 
directions which last year produced a string of fs for failure 
and ns for nonsatisfactory there were 2 ns and 13 ss for 
satisfactory 
is ritalin a panacea no even with the pill toms attention 
deficit still requires the guidance of a skillful teacher 
are we comfortable about him taking medicine yes and no 
we like the results but are uncomfortable treating a symptom 
the cause of which no one knows we are especially uncomfortable 
that the psychologists and doctors seem unconcerned why tom has 
trouble paying attention 
will we keep giving him the pill yes at least while tom thinks 
its helpful well also keep trying to find a deeper understanding 
of whats involved 
as tom says its not perfect but it works some

for parents facing a decision on whether to medicate a child 
with ritalin psychiatrists and pediatricians offer some advice 
make sure the diagnosis is made carefully and the treatment 
involves more than just taking pills 
ritalin is commonly prescribed for hyperactive children with 
attention deficit disorder but too often they are diagnosed 
without proper testing and evaluation they say 
and if a treatment does not include counseling and educational 
therapies it probably is faulty the experts add 
i think there are children given the drug who do not have 
add said dr jerry wiener president of the american academy of 
child and adolescent psychiatry and if they do drugs alone are 
not going to resolve that very often mistakes are made of making 
the diagnosis and then only prescribing the drug 
parents wiener said should expect five things of their 
physician 
a complete and thorough diagnosis 
information about possible side effects 
close monitoring of the effects of medication through regular 
visits 
information about alternative treatments 
an explanation of the consequences if medication is not used 
if the physician does not do these things parents have every 
reason to seek medical help elsewhere wiener said 
the american psychiatric associations diagnostic and 
statistical manual of mental disorders says an add diagnosis must 
include signs of inattention and impulsivity as well as onset 
before age 7 and duration of at least six months other disorders 
must be ruled out 
an add study group appointed by the georgia department of 
education called add one of the most timeconsuming of the 
disorders of childhood to evaluate 
dr michael levine a san antonio texas child hyperactivity 
expert said he spends two hours taking history and 10 hours 
testing before making an add diagnosis 
when you see johnny staring out the window or bouncing off the 
walls you dont know if hes offtask because of a brain filter 
problem treatable with ritalin a learning disability or a 
behavioral problem levine said 
once an add diagnosis is made experts say too often the child 
is treated only with medications such as ritalin the prescribed 
way to go until as recently as 1970 the latest research shows that 
a more effective treatment combines medication with therapy and 
counseling 
everyone agrees that you have to do something more than give a 
pill said dr james satterfield of encino calif who pioneered 
some add research in the real world most of the children get 
one treatment seldom two never three and the most common would 
be medication

a nationwide strike over wages by 
505000 public school teachers entered its fourth week monday 
affecting 72 million students aged 3 to 18 
primary and secondary school teachers in every province except 
northeastern corrientes have been on strike since the school year 
began march 14 demanding a minimum salary of about 117 a month 
corrientes teachers reached a separate accord in march 
the government in this economically pressed nation has admitted 
that teachers salaries are low but says it cannot afford to pay 
more than 85 a month 
the teachers union has rejected the offer as insufficient 
saying many teachers are forced to work a second job because some 
instructors in the poorer provinces outside buenos aires are paid 
as little as 54 a month

jesse jackson noting today the unfinished business 
remaining two decades after martin luther king jr was slain 
plunged into backtoback battles with democratic presidential 
rival michael dukakis in colorado and wisconsin 
fortyfive democratic delegates are at stake in tonights 
colorado caucuses tuesdays wisconsin primary offers an even 
richer prize 81 democratic delegates plus a boost heading into a 
round of bigstate contests in coming weeks 
jackson walked a hispanic neighborhood in milwaukee courting 
votes and saying the 20th anniversary of kings death has an 
historic meaning for all 
in some sense today the challenge is to end the unfinished 
business and end economic violence against family farmers and 
average working people said jackson a king protege in the 
turbulent 1960s 
a day earlier the presidential candidates spent easter sunday 
courting church congregations 
pat robertson his republican bid all but crushed by vice 
president george bush claimed a divine mandate for his 
presidential candidacy 
we are laying the foundation for a great victory for this 
nation it may not be in 1988 but i am not going to quit 
said the former television evangelist that is his plan for me 
and this nation 
jackson preached easter sermons to huge crowds in colorado 
telling them hope has been unleashed 
jackson also called again for panamanian strongman manuel 
antonio noriega to leave his country but said he would not act as 
mediator between the united states and noriega jackson released a 
letter from noriega in which the dictator rejected any imposition 
and any political and economic program that will be dictated from 
washington dc 
jackson chalked up another win over the weekend in the virgin 
islands democratic caucus picking up 634 votes to dukakis 37 the 
contest netted jackson only three delegates but he drew closer to 
the massachusetts governor in their seesaw battle for supremacy in 
the delegate race 
the latest ap tally gave dukakis 65355 jackson 64655 with 
the uncommitted tally at 4686 tennessee sen albert gore had 
3818 and sen paul simon of illinois 1695 
gore and simon are both badly in need of a win in wisconsin 
gore has not had a victory since super tuesday simon has only won 
in his home state of illinois 
simon searched for votes as children hunted eggs at an easter 
egg hunt in madison he said he shares jacksons passion for the 
less fortunate adding i offer not only passion but the 
experience to do something about it 
simon also said his credentials are better than those of dukakis 
i have the experience with national issues that frankly mike 
doesnt have he said 
a poll in the milwaukee journal conducted wednesday and 
thursday gave dukakis a narrow lead over jackson in wisconsin 43 
to 35 percent gore had 15 percent and simon 5 percent according 
to the poll which had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 
percentage points 
although its survey suggested gore was behind the newspaper 
endorsed him calling the tennessee senator the best qualified to 
serve as president the journal praised jackson for shaking up 
the political process but said his lack of experience in 
government was a weak point 
gore has been hitting at jacksons lack of government experience 
and questioning his electability dukakis however shied away from 
predicting how jackson would do against bush 
i dont think there is any way of knowing he told reporters 
outside a milwaukee church on sunday but he added i think 
george bush is beatable id like to be able to run against him 
democratic party chairman paul kirk also sidestepped questions 
about jacksons electability 
the democratic party will do its best to nominate i hope the 
most electable candidate in order to win in november kirk said 
sunday on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
a poll published in this weeks editions of us news amp world 
report said if jackson became dukakis running mate the democrats 
could defeat the republican ticket regardless of who became bushs 
running mate a dukakisjackson ticket was supported by 47 percent 
of the 1004 people contacted last week by telephone for the poll 
while a hypothetical gop ticket of bush and illinois gov jim 
thompson would win 42 percent the survey said 
the poll conducted by the roper organization had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points 
another poll published in this weeks editions of newsweek 
magazine said twothirds of democrats and voters leaning toward 
the party say jackson should get the nomination if he leads in 
popular vote and delegates at the time of the convention even if 
he doesnt have the 2082 delegates needed to nominate 
jacksons campaign chairman california assembly speaker willie 
brown raised the possibility of a floor fight at the convention 
this summer if the jackson forces believed the delegate race had 
not played out fairly 
i think if the rules need to be challenged we will do so 
said brown also interviewed on the abc program 
however brown said he did not believe jackson was automatically 
entitled to the nomination if he led in popular vote and delegate 
totals at the end of the primary season 
i only believe hes entitled to the nomination if we succeed 
in producing the appropriate number of delegates brown said 
jackson himself downplayed the possibility of a convention fight 
were certainly going to stand for fairness but i hope it 
wont come to a fight i think that most democrats are going to 
stand for that which is fair and that which is right he said as 
he campaigned in colorado

poland was all wet on monday 
nationwide young people hurled buckets of water at each other 
in the annual posteaster folk holiday of pouring monday 
in warsaw the teenagers also doused a few police officers who 
wandered by the goodnatured and vaguely political water games that 
pitted a contingent of smurfs dressed in blue against 
greenclad water people in castle square in the old town 
the 1000 participants slogans had tongueincheek 
confrontational overtones freedom and water free the 
buckets and smurfs cops go home 
the banned but still active independent students union organized 
the unusually large gathering in warsaw according to a recent 
warsaw university graduate who identified herself only as 
agnieszka 24 
easter monday is a national holiday in poland and the days 
traditional activity in the countryside is for peasant boys to soak 
notsoreluctant girls with water in polish the holiday is called 
smigus dyngus pronounced shmeegoos dinggoos a nonsense 
phrase meaning the custom of pouring water on people on easter 
monday 
the phrase pouring water is slang for lying in poland 
and the student group raised a sign later pulled down by police 
that said the government spokesman is the best example of 
pouring water 
agnieszka said the group was following the example of a wroclaw 
opposition organization orange alternative that specializes in 
opposing the government with humor and satire 
police in groups of twos and threes walked through the crowd 
stopping some people to check ids and at times ordering young 
people to quietly empty their buckets of water 
but whenever they appeared about to detain one of the 
participants who ranged in age from about 13 to 25 the police 
were surrounded by groups chanting let him go in the end it 
appeared no one was arrested 
plastic bottles buckets water bombs made with plastic bags and 
even tree sprayers were the weapons of choice in the battles under 
sunny skies with temperatures in the 50s 
at one point two officers found themselves completely 
surrounded and water filled the air although one policemans back 
was soaked the officers laughed along with their attackers

the soviets have begun preparations to remove 
the first of their 115000 soldiers from afghanistan although no 
date has been set for the withdrawal and un peace talks are at an 
impasse administration sources say 
the soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze made an 
unexpected trip to kabul on sunday to discuss serious 
difficulties caused by the us and pakistani demands that moscow 
halt aid to the afghan government at the same washington stops the 
flow of covert arms to guerrilla forces 
shevardnadze has said the soviets will withdraw even if the 
talks collapse 
and a us government analyst said the intelligence community 
is unanimous in reporting that preparations for a withdrawal have 
commenced 
but the analyst speaking on condition of anonymity stressed 
that the exact time duration and manner of the soviet withdrawal 
remained unclear 
shevardnadze in an interview with the official tass news 
agency said he was going to kabul to discuss and coordinate with 
the afghan leadership the various options for action in all their 
aspects in the event that the geneva process fails to bring about 
the desired results 
us sources declined to provide details about soviet 
preparations to withdraw the red army which first entered 
afghanistan in 1979 in the past the soviets have removed some 
peripheral units such as antiaircraft batteries but replaced 
them with others the current preparations are of a different 
character the sources said 
whether or not an agreement is reached the soviets are expected 
to start a withdrawal by pulling units of their 40th army from 
garrisons south of gardez and from kandahar shinand and herat in 
the west according to administration officials 
these units are the most exposed to attack from a mujahedeen 
force estimated by administration analysts to number about 200000 
soviet diplomats have indicated a willingness to withdraw 
between 30 percent and 50 percent of their forces within the first 
90 days of an agreement pulling out the remainder within 10 months 
after a pact is signed 
afghan guerrillas as well as pakistani and us diplomats say 
a 10month withdrawal timetable would allow the soviets and their 
allies to destroy the mujahedeen if the flow of us arms were cut 
but some us analysts believe an initial withdrawal of up to 50 
percent of soviet forces would include tactical air units operating 
over south and west afghanistan leaving garrisons manned by the 
army of the kremlinbacked government open to mujahedeen attack 
morale is already poor among the 40000 afghan government 
forces according to the guerrillas and us analysts believe the 
confidence of the government has been shaken badly by the soviet 
announcement that the red army will leave 
if the un talks produce an agreement the soviets are thought 
likely to leave elite special purpose forces to provide a security 
shield for the kabul regime while moving the bulk of their 
departing forces to the soviet union possibly to an area just 
north of the border 
if the un talks collapse and the soviets decide on a 
unilateral withdrawal all bets are off one analyst said 
one likely option however would be for the soviets to 
concentrate forces around kabul and within a recently created 
province in the far north along the soviet border 
the new province of sari pull was created from parts of balkh 
and juzjan provinces which are separated from the soviet republics 
of uzbekistan and tadzhikistan by the amu darya river the 
mujahedeen have staged a number of raids none very destructive 
across the remote border according to afghan and soviet reports 
the largest town in the new province is mazarisharif which 
us analysts have long considered a likely final staging area for 
a soviet withdrawal

christo the unconventional artist whose 
creations have included fabricwrapped islands and a 24mile cloth 
fence now wants parts of japan and southern california to blossom 
with 3000 huge umbrellas 
a big part of it is a comparison of differences and 
similarities between places and people with a lot of affinities 
christo 52 said recently by telephone from his studio in new york 
his plan calls for about 1500 yellow umbrellas 198 feet high 
and 264 feet in diameter to blossom like california poppies in 
the tehachapi mountains 60 miles north of los angeles at the same 
time he wants to unfold 1500 umbrellas identical except blue 
in the lush rural valley of japans ibaraki prefecture 72 miles 
north of tokyo 
the project has two parts and will happen only like that 
christo said of the umbrellas joint project for japan and the 
usa 
thats assuming he gets all the necessary government permits and 
permission from scores of landowners and raises an estimated 8 
million to 10 million the california legislature already backs 
him 
like always the permits is the most unknown he said 
nobody can assume how in what direction they will move and they 
probably are the most consuming in time 
for decades christo has created art on an epic scale 
in 1985 he wrapped the almost400yearold pont neuf bridge in 
paris with 440000 square feet of champagnecolored fabric two 
years earlier he surrounded 11 islands in floridas biscayne bay 
with 6 million square feet of shocking pink polypropylene in 1976 
he used a white translucent fabric to create running fence an 
18foothigh fence that ran like a ribbon across 24 miles of marin 
and sonoma counties in northern california 
each of his big projects christo said aims to create a 
gentle disturbance of space to create new boundaries new 
territories and a new type of range limitation of very routine 
space that everybody uses 
i see these projects as a poetical scream a scream of 
freedom the bulgarianborn artist said 
not everyone shares his vision for more than 15 years the west 
german government has refused to let him wrap fabric around the old 
german parliament the reichstag 
christo hopes to bring the umbrellas to fruition in october 
1990 like his other works the umbrellas will be exhibited for a 
few weeks and then removed 
at christos insistence financing must be arranged privately 
backed by the sale of his preparatory drawings studies collages 
scale models and early works 
and of course this part of my work these projects are very 
antimaterialistic christo said they are very linked to huge 
poetical freedom they deal with art not like a commodity but art 
very personal relaxed a very open experience on many levels 
christo has discussed his proposal with officials in los angeles 
and kern counties and a resolution of general support was adopted 
last sept 9 by both houses of the california legislature 
in california christo said his team must obtain the permission 
of 51 private property owners on the 18milelong site from 
gorman along interstate 5 over the tejon pass and down the 
grapevine grade 
in japan there are 750 private landowners on the proposed 
12milemile site 
in california the largest single landowner whose permission 
will be needed is the tejon ranch co 
tejon vice president and general counsel dennis mccarthy said 
there are concerns about public use of ranch property and 
liability but added that its hard to buck the groundswell of 
support christo has gained among public officials 
it leaves landowners in a situation i dont know exactly how 
to say this but you dont want to be a wet blanket or the 
grinch who stole christmas mccarthy said

democratic presidential hopeful jesse jackson 
today renewed his call for panamanian strongman manuel antonio 
noriega to leave panama and released a letter in which noriega 
rejected any political and economic program that will be dictated 
from washington dc 
jackson who had sent a letter to noriega on march 22 urging him 
to leave his troubled country said he would forward noriegas 
response to the state department and congress 
i remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the 
panamanian people for gen noriega to leave today i reiterate my 
public moral appeal for him to depart jackson said 
at the state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
indicated displeasure over jacksons communications with noriega 
in our view proliferation of channels is a tactic that noriega 
likes to use to buy time ms oakley said we have available 
channels of communication with noriega if and when they are needed 
we think it would be best to continue to use these channels 
exclusively 
the jackson campaign released an unofficial translation of a 
letter from noriega 
noriega said the panamanian defense forces reject any 
imposition and any political and economic program that will be 
dictated from washington dc 
my duration as commander and chief of the defense forces is 
governed by the panamanian constitution and law of the defense 
forces he said 
in a postscript noriega wrote i have been lied about i have 
been villified i have been humiliated internationally i consider 
myself to be been persecuted by illegal action by socalled 
justice by political interests of your nation i as a christian 
before you denounce this untrue sic 
early today jackson told national public radio he would not 
play a mediating role between the us government and noriega i 
see no direct role in the relationship myself 
my appeal to him was to leave jackson said sunday in an 
interview with the associated press during his colorado swing 
jackson said that in his letter to noriega he offered to do 
whatever he could to facilitate his exit from that country 
jackson said a friend of his cirilo mcsween of chicago had 
gone to panama at his request to meet with noriega jackson 
described mcsween as a friend of 20 years who was originally from 
panama 
using rhetoric from his recent speeches jackson said us 
policy has been misguided 
weve set the forest on fire to smoke one person out he 
said 
the civil rights leader who has made international trips in the 
past to try to negotiate solutions to complicated crises said he 
did not think he would go to panama 
i doubt that jackson said 
later at a colorado springs news conference jackson gave this 
response 
no im not prepared to go right now he said 
jackson said the current situation is full of danger for the 
united states in the critical central american region 
unless the present crisis ends we could lose by having 
tremendous antiamericanism in panama jackson said

the roman catholic church shepherd 
of latin americas soul for centuries often minds its politics as 
well and is a component of life mediator pacifier giver of 
praise and criticism by turns 
latin americans often turn to the church in times of crisis and 
have done so in this troubled country 
archbishop marcos mcgrath of panama has been asked to mediate 
the political dispute that began in june over the leadership of 
gen manuel antonio noriega who commands the defense forces and 
controls the civilian government 
it is a role the church has filled in nearby nations most 
notably el salvador and nicaragua 
panamas catholic church has become increasingly critical of 
noriegas rule but there are those who say mcgrath and the 
nations priests and bishops have not taken a firm enough stand 
against him 
the church often is criticized in latin america but is an 
imposing presence rich in tradition with the confidence of a 
large share of the population and the grudging respect of 
politicians and the military 
through nearly two millennia the roman catholic church has been 
the inquisition but also propagator of the faith preserver of 
literature and translator of the classics 
it is a priest blessing military leaders another doing 
community work in slums or among poor peasants one performing a 
society wedding while his brother takes up the guerrilla cause 
demanding social justice 
it is a reclusive conservative bishop rejecting new ideas and 
archbishop oscar arnulfo romero of el salvador speaking from his 
church through loudspeakers so those in the government palace could 
hear him complain about military violations of human rights he was 
assassinated in march 1980 
some say wryly that latin americans will do anything for the 
church except go inside one but as an institution it generally is 
trusted more than governments or the military 
people perceive the church as an impartial institution capable 
of settling disputes said fidel chavez mena a leader of the 
christian democratic party in el salvador the culture and 
religious sentiment of our people make them believe in the church 
as political and armed strife increased in the countries of 
central america in the past decade the church has become involved 
more frequently to mediate or criticize regimes it sees as 
violators of human rights 
mcgrath has publicly demanded that the military submit to 
civilian rule but churchgoers who want him to be more critical of 
noriega held a public protest outside his cathedral last week 
the archbishop has not been an outspoken critic in the past 
those close to him describe mcgrath as a diplomatic negotiator who 
would rather avoid a direct confrontation with the military 
many of his priests are foreigners and the government forces 
them to have their residency visas stamped each three months no 
matter how long they have spent in panama 
mcgrath has acknowledged holding several meetings with noriega 
in search of a solution to panamas political conflict 
the church has tried to build a silver bridge for noriega to 
leave the rev fernando guardia vicar of the panama city 
diocese said in an interview 
mediation by the church was agreed upon by the parties involved 
and was made through president oscar arias of costa rica prime 
minister felipe gonzalez of spain and carlos andres perez and 
daniel oduber former presidents of venezuela and costa rica 
respectively 
another latin american archbishop cardinal obando y bravo of 
nicaragua has been a thorn in the side of the leftist sandinista 
government but it also turned to him as mediator when it first 
agreed to talks with the ussupported rebels 
in 1974 and 1978 obando y bravo had acted as gobetween for the 
sandinista national liberation front then outlawed and the 
rightwing government of president anastasio somoza to obtain the 
freedom of future president daniel ortega and other top leaders 
the sandinistas won the civil war in july 1979 
obando y bravo served as a witness earlier this month when the 
sandinistas and the rebels known as contras signed a preliminary 
ceasefire agreement 
it is not easy to mediate but the church always is ready to 
contribute to national reconciliation he said in a recent 
interview 
in el salvador archbishop arturo rivera damas is involved in 
stalemated talks between leftist rebels and the usbacked 
government of president jose napoleon duarte 
archbishop prospero penados del barrio of guatemala has agreed 
to mediate between leftist rebels and the government which has yet 
to return to the negotiating table after a first round in october 
in honduras the church is part of the national reconciliation 
commission set up under the central american peace plan of aug 7 
to seek political solutions to internal conflicts 
the church has the moral authority and credibility to act as 
mediator said adan fletes leader of nicaraguas social 
christian party

a panamanian government official 
suggested the united states might have staged a chase of its 
ambassadors car to justify an eventual military evasion 
the us embassy said ambassador arthur davis was pursued for 
two miles in panama city on sunday by a government military vehicle 
with its siren blaring it called the incident serious 
sundays communique signed by justice minister rodolfo chiari de 
leon said the incident began when a police sergeant saw civilians 
in three vehicles following the ambassadors car with an 
exaggerated display of automatic arms 
we do not want to think that they are fabricating false 
accusations against our armed forces to justify an announced 
invasion of panama and we reiterate the intent of the panamanian 
government to protect the life and property of residents and 
foreigners including north americans the communique said 
in washington state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley escalated the administrations criticism of panama over the 
incident 
we consider any threat to the safety of the ambassador to be 
serious as always she said today we will take the necessary 
steps to protect americans i am condemning the incident from the 
podium we regard the action as deliberate harassment 
the united states is sending 1300 additional troops to panama 
on tuesday troops were loading weapons and supplies into 
helicopters today in the united states in preparation 
american officials have said the forces are intended to protect 
us bases and american citizens washington has declared it will 
not use military force to oust gen manuel antonio noriega whose 
leadership has been the focus of a national political and economic 
crisis 
sundays edition of the governmentrun newspaper la republica 
quoted progovernment labor leaders as urging panamanians to 
prepare for an american invasion when the additional troops begin 
arriving 
there are 10000 troops stationed at the us southern command 
in panama pentagon officials said more troops may be sent if they 
are needed 
the chase on sunday ended an otherwise calm easter holiday and 
ushered in a week of uncertainty for panamanians a roman catholic 
church offer to mediate an end to the countrys political crisis 
was set to expire at midnight tonight 
embassy spokesman terence kneebone said davis was leaving the 
home of vatican ambassador jose sebastian laboa when the panamanian 
vehicle began following immediately picking them up right 
outside the gate he said it tried to stop the chaufferdriven 
car with its lights and sirens 
the ambassadors driver in accordance with instructions did 
not stop the ambassador was driven to his residence and the other 
vehicle followed all the way kneebone said the residences are 
about two miles apart 
we consider this serious kneebone said he declined to 
comment on what security provisions davis had but said they were 
normal under the circumstances no weapons were displayed in the 
chase he said 
embassy vehicles are clearly marked with special license plates 
earlier sunday kneebone said davis had gone to pay his respects 
on easter to the papal nuncio who is dean of the diplomatic corps 
in panama 
eric arturo delvalle in hiding since he was ousted from the 
presidency after he tried to fire strongman noriega feb 25 has 
called for the united states to intervene militarily and remove the 
general noriega is under indictment on us drugtrafficking 
charges 
monsignor marcos antonio mcgrath the archbishop of panama city 
agreed to requests by several foreign governments to act as 
mediator in the dispute and several opposition leaders said they 
would back the idea under certain conditions 
mcgrath set a midnight deadline for all parties to agree to the 
arrangement or the offer would be withdrawn the government has not 
responded 
the opposition conditions included guarantees that noriega head 
of the nations 15000member defense forces and the power behind 
the civilian government indicate a willingness to resign and to 
leave the country 
a letter made public friday by three opposition leaders said any 
agreement would have to be guaranteed by the church four 
government officials to be named later and the presidents of costa 
rica and panama 
meanwhile leaders of the national civic crusade the main 
opposition coalition were considering sunday whether to call off a 
2weekold general strike that lost momentum last week 
the united states has frozen panamanian assets in american 
banks choking the flow of dollars the official currency in 
panama banks have remained closed since march 3 
most panamanians are saving cash for essentials and thousands 
of families especially in poorer areas have had to turn to 
churchrun food kitchens for their meals the cash shortage has 
kept the government from paying its estimated 130000 employees for 
a month

troops stopped vehicles and blocked 
escape routes to malaysia during a nationwide search monday for the 
leader of the aug 28 coup attempt 
the military said four more soldiers jailed in plots against 
president corazon aquino also were missing 
the government told foreign and philippine reporters not to 
publish or broadcast interviews with former lt col gregorio 
gringo honasan who fled a prison ship in manila bay before 
dawn saturday with 14 of his navy guards 
honasans coup attempt left at least 53 people dead and hundreds 
wounded he had been confined in the prison ship since his arrest 
dec 9 
chief military spokesman col oscar florendo said the armed 
forces had received reports that honasan 39 had been seen in 
manila rural luzon and mindanao island about 500 miles south of 
the capital 
the search for excol honasan continues florendo told 
reporters however right now we dont have any concrete lead to 
follow 
florendo denied allegations by opposition sen juan ponce enrile 
that troops raided enriles vacation house in batangas province 
sunday during the search 
honasan was defense ministry security chief when enrile was 
minister of national defense enrile was fired in november 1986 
after the government said it prevented a coup attempt by his 
followers 
florendo said three officers and an enlisted man jailed for 
involvement in the 1987 coup attempts were missing from the 
detention center at villamor air base but he said the four fled 
because of pressing family problems and their escape was not 
related to honasans breakout 
armed troops seeking honasan manned checkpoints around manila 
and searched private vehicles the philippine constabulary 
strengthened security in southern provinces to prevent honasan from 
slipping out of the country by boat to malaysia a traditional 
escape route for fugitives and political dissidents 
share prices on the manila stock exchange closed 228 per cent 
lower monday after trading resumed following the easter break 
traders blamed the decline on fears of instability in the wake of 
honasans escape 
florendo said the military found no evidence that foreigners 
were involved in the escape leftist rep venancio garduce had said 
americans may have helped honasan escape to pressure the government 
as it begins talks tuesday with the united states on the status of 
its military bases here 
justice secretary sedfrey ordonez told philippine radio and 
television stations they may lose their licenses if they broadcast 
interviews with honasan who gave many interviews before his arrest 
ordonez issued the warning after the private radio station dzxl 
sought permission to air a statement from honasan hours after he 
escaped a dzxl official confirmed it had a taped statement from 
honasan but would not say what it contained 
ordonez said the rights of free speech and press were the 
hallmarks of philippine democracy restored after mrs aquino was 
swept to power in the february 1986 civilianmilitary uprising that 
toppled president ferdinand marcos 
however like all other freedoms these rights cannot be 
permitted by the duly constituted government to be employed to 
destroy the very government which guarantees these protections 
he said 
he said the policy also applied to foreign correspondents and 
philippine print media but he gave no legal basis for including 
newspapers which do not need a license to operate

the supreme court agreed monday to examine the 
authority of federal judges to secondguess decisions by pension 
and welfare plans that deny benefits to workers 
the court said it will hear an appeal by firestone tire amp rubber 
co in a case stemming from the sale of its plastics division in 
1980 
firestone sold the division to occidental petroleum corp the 
sale affected some 500 workers at firestone plants in pottstown 
pa west caldwell nj perryville and salisbury md and baton 
rouge la 
nearly all the employees were given the opportunity to keep 
their jobs under the new ownership and most accepted 
the workers also sought certain benefits from firestone 
including early retirement and severance pay that were included in 
the companys pension and welfare plan 
the company denied the benefits it also refused to give the 
workers information they requested about the benefit plan on 
grounds they no longer were employed by firestone 
the workers sued in federal court charging the company violated 
the federal employee retirement and income security act of 1974 
erisa 
a judge threw out the suit on grounds that firestone did not act 
in an arbitrary and capricious manner 
but the 3rd us circuit court of appeals reinstated the suit 
the appeals court said workers claims must be examined more 
closely in cases in which the administrator of a benefit plan is 
the sole source of its funds such as firestone and is not a 
neutral manager 
the appeals court also said the workers are eligible for damages 
from firestone for its refusal to provide information on benefits 
even though they no longer work for firestone 
the us chamber of commerce and the national association of 
manufacturers supported firestones appeal to the supreme court 
the fundamental purpose of employee benefit plan 
administrators is to make benefit determinations and to manage 
assets the business groups said it is unreasonable to assume 
that congress intended courts to secondguess plan administrators 
by subjecting their decisions to such federal court review 
they said there are some 750000 pension plans run by single 
employers and more than 4 million company welfare plans most of 
which are employeradministered 
the case is firestone vs bruch 871054

michael dukakis stood in the muddy farmyard 
showing a group of children how to play the traditional greek game 
cracking of eggs on easter sunday 
you hold the egg up like this the massachusetts governor 
told one child and then turned to another and said and then you 
hold your egg and tap hers the one whose egg isnt broken at the 
end is the winner 
dukakis the democratic presidential candidate with a reputation 
as a technocrat is trying to warm his cool image as he struggles 
to win wisconsins primary tuesday and get back on track for the 
nomination 
im a guy who is passionate about cheese dukakis cracked as 
he was presented with a big chunk of wisconsin cheese at the 
danielson farm here on sunday 
jesse jackson stunned dukakis with a sweeping 2to1 win in the 
michigan caucuses on march 26 rocking a campaign that was trying 
to build momentum and a sense that he was the inevitable nominee 
riding the wave out of michigan jackson has drawn big crowds in 
wisconsin ahead of that states primary on tuesday 
to counter jackson by far the campaigns best orator dukakis 
has unveiled a new speech a sharpened message of his own and a 
more relaxed style on the stump 
emphasizing his strength as a decisionmaking state executive 
dukakis in his new speech declares that he wants to be known as the 
great builder not the great communicator a phrase often 
applied to ronald reagan 
after seven years of charisma maybe a little competence is in 
order in the white house is one of dukakis new applause lines 
there is also a new television ad that condemns reagans 
economic policies and closes with dukakis sitting coatless in his 
office talking about what he wants to do for people 
hes spent 25 years in public service making a difference in 
peoples lives dukakis spokesman leslie dach said in explaining 
the current emphasis of the campaign 
jacksons major pitch that he has stood with the workers and 
the farmers in their hours of crisis has been a compelling one 
dukakis has tried to counter that in both public and private 
meetings by explaining his use of a massachusetts plantclosing law 
to save jobs and his efforts to save a big general motors plant in 
massachusetts chryslers decision to close a plant in kenosha has 
been a target for all the democratic candidates 
but substance is not the only way to woo voters image and style 
are key elements that the dukakis campaign has not ignored 
in recent days dukakis has donned an apron to serve food to 
senior citizens and at an easter supper at a greek orthodox church 
he went to the danielsons barn to be photographed watching as cows 
were milked in this state with a big dairy industry 
its also about rolling up your sleeves and working hard for 
votes dach added 
dukakis has his own explanation for the change after a long day 
of campaigning sunday he mused on the chartered plane that 
spending so much time in iowa talking to small groups of people 
who are passionately interested in this one issue made him aware 
that retail politics are at heart of what we are doing 
the massachusetts governor opens his stump speeches with digs at 
wisconsin gov tommy thompson who said last week he would vote for 
jackson if he were a democrat 
the dukakis campaign is deeply worried about such a crossover 
vote in this openprimary state but dukakis makes light of that 
saying he sent the republican governor a note thanking him for 
making it clear that george bush does not want to run against 
dukakis in the fall then he adds 
tommy really got excited the other day according to the 
newspapers he was introducing the vice president in waukesha and 
he said its time for the bush pregnancy to begin 
ill drink to that dukakis says ill drink to that 
several times before union or bluecollar crowds dukakis has 
used a mild expletive that is something friends say the candidate 
does occasionally in private but it has rarely been heard before 
in the carefully watched appearances on the campaign trail 
hell im the only candidate in this race who has ever 
balanced a budget he said at one point 
boasting about the benefits of full employment dukakis added 
hell they are paying six bucks an hour in mcdonalds in my state 
because they cant get people

superconductivity expert cw paul chu said 
monday he will remain at the university of houston after rejecting 
an offer to move to the university of california at berkeley 
chu called the decision one of the most difficult of his life 
and said he had been torn between his loyalty to houston and his 
desire to be at berkeley as it has been a personal goal to join 
the berkeley faculty 
in a statement chu said developing the superconductivity 
effort at uh is a great responsibility one that has been made 
easier thanks to the support of the university foundations 
industry and city state and federal government 
berkeleys effort to land chu highlighted the pressure on 
developers of highertermperature superconductors which transmit 
electricity without resistance 
previously superconductors worked only at temperatures near 
absolute zero or about minus 460 degrees fahrenheit 
highertemperature devices could revolutionize electrical 
transmission computers trains and many other electrical devices 
scientists say 
chu has built up a group there in houston and he feels 
responsible to them said berkeley physicist marvin l cohen chu 
also may have considered the career of his wife mary a vice 
president of a houston bank he added

the supreme court today agreed to review 
rulings limiting korean air lines financial liability for a 1983 
disaster in which 269 people died the shooting down of a kal 
passenger jet over soviet airspace 
the justices said they will study arguments that the airline 
should have to face more than 75000 in damages for each death 
kal flight 7 en route from new york city to seoul korea was 
shot down by a soviet military airplane sept 1 1983 after flying 
more than 300 miles off course and entering soviet airspace over 
the sea of japan 
one of the 61 americans killed was democratic rep lawrence 
mcdonald of georgia 
many of the victims families including mcdonalds widow sued 
kal in various federal courts the wrongfuldeath lawsuits were 
consolidated and presented to a federal trial judge here 
lawyers for the victims families in 1984 asked us district 
judge aubrey e robinson jr to declare that kal was not eligible 
for the 75000perdeath liability cap imposed by the warsaw 
convention and the montreal agreement treaties covering 
international airline travel 
the treaties specify that passenger tickets must tell of the 
75000 limit warning in lettering no smaller than 10point print 
the kal tickets told of the liability limit in slightly smaller 
8point print 
judge robinson ruled that the 75000 limit applied to the kal 
disaster and his decision was upheld by the us circuit court of 
appeals here last sept 25 
the appeals court ruling conflicts with a decision by the 5th 
us circuit court of appeals stemming from a 1982 airline crash in 
kenner la that killed 154 people 
the 5th circuit court upheld 720000 in wrongfuldeath awards 
won by the families of five uruguayans who were among the victims 
on pan am flight 759 which crashed outside new orleans shortly 
after takeoff july 9 1982 
pan am was barred from benefiting from the 75000perdeath 
limit because the limit was discussed on its tickets in 9point 
rather than 10point print 
the case is in re kal disaster 871055

thousands of protestants 
waving british flags marched monday to mark a 299yearold victory 
over roman catholics and vowed to oppose forever a 
catholicdominated united ireland 
the protestant parades followed sundays peaceful marches across 
the province by catholics commemorating the 1916 easter rising 
against british rule in what is now the republic of ireland 
led by 40 fifeanddrum bands the probritish apprentice boys 
parades marched peacefully in a carnivallike atmosphere to 
commemorate protestant resistance to the 1689 siege of londonderry 
ordered by englands catholic king james ii 
the apprentice boys take their name from 12 apprentices said to 
have slammed londonderrys gates on james army at the start of the 
unsuccessful 105day siege 
hardline protestant lawmaker peter robinson told several hundred 
marchers at dundonald on the outskirts of belfast that the irish 
republican army was planning an allout war against protestants 
the outlawed ira is fighting to drive the british from northern 
ireland and unite it with the overwhelmingly catholic irish 
republic 
robinson said that over the past few months the ira has brought 
into ireland arms more powerful and sophisticated than ever 
used before 
however the loyalist protestant community will band itself 
together and make it clear to the ira that while it may be 
victorious in the atrocities it carries out the final victory will 
go to those who have endured the most he said 
leaders of sinn fein the legal political wing of the ira 
dashed any hopes sunday of a ceasefire 
sinn fein president gerry adams said he expected talks to 
continue with the moderate catholic social democratic and labor 
party on an overall strategy for justice and peace in the 
strifetorn province where protestants outnumber catholics 32 
but sinn fein vice president martin mcguinness stressed the ira 
has gone on record as saying there will be no more ceasefires 
talk can take place but the war will go on he said 
john hume leader of the social democrats said he intends to 
pursue his partys dialogue with sinn fein despite their opposition 
to any ceasefire until britain announces its withdrawal from the 
province 
nobody should be surprised that sinn fein have a very 
different approach from us at the beginning because if we had the 
same approach there would be no need for dialogue hume was 
quoted monday as telling the irish times 
party chairman alban maginness told bbc radio ulster the talks 
are concerned with much broader issues than arranging a ceasefire 
we are concerned with establishing the conditions whereby 
there will be a total permanent end of all violence he said 
the meetings have sparked speculation that talks including 
protestants as well as catholics might be the next step 
but robinson a key figure in rev ian paisleys democratic 
unionist party one of the provinces two main protestant parties 
ruled out participation in such talks he said he remained 
vehemently opposed to any formula to solve northern irelands 
problems based on the angloirish agreement 
the 1985 accord gives the irish republic a consultative role in 
the administration of northern ireland which robinson and many 
protestants view as the first step to a united catholicrun 
ireland 
no way will unionist protestant leaders sit down and talk to 
the mouthpiece of the ira gerry adams robinson said 
at the largest protestant march in banbridge 25 miles southwest 
of belfast several thousand people stood in silence for one minute 
in memory of members of the security forces killed in the sectarian 
violence the 11 people who died in a november ira bombing at a war 
memorial in enniskillen and two british soldiers killed march 19

home which backs up to swampland he packed them with leaves 
grass and straw in a plastic wine jug with air holes and mailed it

22cent firstclass letters 
officials said letters that show up monday with 22 cent stamps 
will probably get a day of amnesty because of the cost of returning 
them all to senders 
its just not feasible to do something like that said 
central square superintendent edmund powers 
on saturday barbara lillie of newton corner brought 15 letters 
to the newtonville post office 
thats why all my mail is going out today even a few things 
that can wait until later she said 
lillie said the smallscale thrift while paying her bills made 
her feel good like going to the supermarket with your coupons 
and saving 20 cents or whatever 
there also were plenty of people buying the new 25 cent stamps 
or 3 centers to supplement leftover stocks of the old 22s 
it was really busy said carolyn lafee a clerk at the

started out with 1000 fingerlings a couple of years ago on the 
30acre farm she and her husband own just north of grand rapids 
she had a big setback shortly after she began torrential rains 
in september 1986 caused a dam to burst a mile upstream on the 
rogue river and flooded the ponds 
we lost 6000 fish she said and the survivors mingled with 
other fish it took me three weeks to sort them all out 
doane is putting in more ponds and building an addition to her 
house for more efficient fish processing

exiled stage director yuri lyubimov will return in 
may to the taganka theater he founded to preside over the opening 
of a production he was working on before he was fired and 
dishonored four years ago 
the tagankas deputy director alexander m yefimovich 
confirmed the 70yearold impresario had accepted an invitation 
from the theater to come to moscow and open boris godunov his 
drama about the troubled eightyear reign of the russian czar who 
died in 1605 
yefimovich said he did not know how long lyubimov would be in 
moscow to put the final touches on the play before opening night 
but he made clear that the popular director would be coming for a 
working visit rather than returning for permanent residence 
as far as i know it wont be a long visit yefimovich said 
lyubimov 70 was working in europe and could not immediately be 
reached for comment on his reported plans to return to his native 
country for the first time in almost five years 
he became an israeli citizen this year and lives with his wife 
katalin and son peter in jerusalem he has been staging 
productions around the world since his departure from moscow in 
july 1983 
when lyubimov departed to bring fyodor dostoyevskys crime and 
punishment to london cultural figures speculated he would not be 
allowed to return that he was allowed to take his family with him 
on the trip indicated he was not expected to return 
under lyubimov the taganka theater became famous for its 
avantgarde productions and controversial themes and he battled 
with censors throughout much of his career in moscow 
lyubimov extended his stay in london demanding assurances that 
he would be allowed artistic freedom once back in the soviet union 
in march 1984 he was fired from the taganka and expelled from the 
communist party 
his name was rarely mentioned in the soviet press until last 
week when the government daily newspaper izvestia carried an 
interview with him in madrid where the taganka company was staging 
maxim gorkys mother 
izvestia quoted lyubimov as saying he would like to return to 
work in the soviet union if conditions were favorable but said he 
was making no political demands 
in order to once again gain strength survive one needs to 
stand on his native land on which he was raised where his fathers 
and grandfathers lived he was quoted as saying 
the director praised the more open literature that is being 
published under mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost and 
said it is necessary to come to see and to work in the 
theater 
in march 1987 lyubimov and a group of other exiled scientists 
and artists wrote an open letter expressing their doubts about 
gorbachevs reform program and calling the soviet union a gravely 
sick country 
the letter was printed by the moscow news and the writers were 
criticized bitterly in the official media which accused them of 
wishing evil on their native land 
lyubimov denied having ill motives and has said in interviews 
while working abroad that he concentrated on productions that would 
acquaint the world with the best of russian culture he staged 
crime and punishment at washingtons arena stage last year 
this weeks edition of moscow news also carried an article about 
the taganka and the companys meeting with lyubimov in madrid 
where he viewed mother four times 
moscow news said lyubimov planned to visit moscow for the 
opening of boris godunov in may but gave no details 
referring to the freer hand allowed in the arts under gorbachev 
the newspaper commented now we can afford to be generous and 
noble in overcoming the excesses of the past

gov evan mecham broke the law and lied 
about it to the state senate a prosecutor said today in urging the 
senate to convict the impeached firstterm republican and remove 
him from office 
prosecutor william french said in closing arguments that mecham 
broke the law in borrowing 80000 from the governors protocol 
fund for his auto dealership 
he has violated the law he has uttered untruths to you 
french said 
earlier prosecutor paul eckstein accused mecham of showing a 
lifetime of reckless disregard for the reputation of anyne who has 
stood in his path to political power 
respondent mecham has demonstrated for all the world to see 
his plain inability to tell the truth eckstein said how much 
proof is required to demonstrate that respondent puffed 
exaggerated misremembered dissembled and outandout lied 
eckstein said mechams conduct in office was not just 
offensive it was grossly offensive 
senators must decide whether to convict mecham on two 
impeachment charges issued by the arizona house a third charge was 
dismissed a vote could come late today or tuesday climaxing five 
weeks of trial lawmakers said a conviction would force the 
firstterm republican out of office 
the first impeachment count accuses the governor of trying to 
thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state 
official mecham contended he did not intend to beak the law and 
that he was not fully informed of the seriousness of the alleged 
threat 
ignorance of the law is no defense eckstein told senators 
but mechams defense lawyer fred craft told senators youre 
being asked to politically assassinate the governor 
he doesnt resign as mecham has been urged to because hes 
not guilty of these charges craft said he dares to right city 
hall and hes doing it at great cost to himself 
craft said in his closing argument that the allegation was based 
on a 90second conversation with department of public safety 
director ralph milstead craft accused prosecutors of seeking to 
twist and torture it in such a way that it accounts for an 
obstruction of justice 
as closing arguments proceeded a trumpeter played taps 
outside the senate building as a group of men carried a mock coffin 
labeled herein lies the right to an elected governor 
the prosecutor accused mecham of making a number of statements 
during his senate testimony that are either wrong or were 
contradicted by other witnesses 
among the examples cited by eckstein was the governors 
testimony recanted a day later that his former chief bodyguard 
had stolen a report from the governors office 
nonetheless eckstein said mecham and department of public 
safety director ralph milstead gave remarkably similar accounts 
of their nov 15 conversation in which mecham allegedly ordered 
milstead not to cooperate with the attorney generals investigation 
of the alleged threat 
mecham admitted in senate testimony that he told milstead the 
attorney general is out to get me and im not going to help him in 
any way 
mecham sat at the defense table during closing arguments when 
he arrived at the capitol he was cheered by a group of 
wellwishers as he walked into the senate building behind 
bodyguards he said nothing but smiled and flashed a thumbsup 
signal at the crowd 
mecham 63 who took office in january 1987 has maintained he 
is innocent of wrongdoing he also is accused of misusing 80000 
from the governors protocol fund by loaning it to his auto 
dealership 
last week the senate dismissed a third charge that mecham 
concealed a 350000 campaign loan the subject of the governors 
april 21 criminal trial some senators said hearing testimony on 
that allegation could have prejudiced his criminal trial 
however democrats acknowledged that the real reason they 
favored dismissing the charge was to ensure a senate trial verdict 
well before the scheduled may 17 gubernatorial recall election 
a twothirds vote of the 30member senate is required for 
conviction lawmakers also could bar mecham from holding any future 
public office if convicted mecham would become the seventh us 
governor removed from office by impeachment 
the prosecution contends the governors protocol fund created 
with inaugural ball proceeds was a public fund and that mecham 
pontiac needed the 80000 loan to meet its july 1987 payroll 
however the defense said the fund was private money and that 
the loan was intended merely to provide a higher interest rate for 
the fund mecham pontiac was in good financial shape and could have 
borrowed the money elsewhere according to testimony by the 
governors son dennis who is general manager of the dealership 
but the day after he testified last week dennis mecham 
announced the dealership was being sold sales had suffered due to 
the avalanche of negative publicity about the governor he said 
the allegation regarding the death threat has boiled down to 
mechams word against that of department of public safety director 
ralph milstead he testified that mecham ordered him not to 
cooperate with the attorney generals investigation of the alleged 
threat by state official lee watkins against former top mecham aide 
donna carlson 
at the time of the alleged threat in november ms carlson was 
about to testify before the state grand jury regarding the 350000 
campaign loan 
senators meanwhile said they knew how important the 
impeachment vote will be 
if the governor is allowed to return to his job i think 
therell be terrible chaos in state government said minority 
leader alan stephens a democrat 
lawmakers own careers also may hang in the balance some 
senators said

israeli soldiers shot a 
palestinian dead and wounded eight on monday a day of strike and 
protest in the occupied lands against the peace mission by 
secretary of state george p shultz 
a palestinian died in the gaza strip of wounds suffered last 
week 
at least 138 arabs have been killed since violence began dec 8 
in the west bank and gaza according to un figures an israeli 
soldier also has died 
talks between shultz and israeli leaders focused on the us 
proposal for palestinian selfrule rather than how to arrange an 
international conference 
prime minister yitzhak shamir opposes such a forum but foreign 
minister shimon peres said the international conference is just 
a door that will be opened peres the prime ministers political 
rival and partner in the coaltiion government supports a 
conference 
he told reporters in haifa the question is what are we going 
to discuss after it the conference is opened maybe the more we 
go into details the less threatening it will be for shamir 
shamir says israel would be outnumbered at such a conference and 
risk having decisions imposed upon it 
shultz pledge the united states to oppose a palestinian state 
and efforts to force israel to give up all territory in the west 
bank and gaza which it captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 
middle east war 
prominent palestinians the united states had seen as potential 
negotiating partners closed ranks against shultz they accused him 
of siding with israel and refused to meet with him 
the boycott of shultz and the general strike were designed to 
underline arab demands to be represented by the palestine 
liberation organization at any peace talks 
authorities stationed 600 policemen in jerusalems walled old 
city to prevent clashes between moslems and militant jews trying to 
pray at the al aqsa mosque complex one of islams holiest shrines 
police turned away the 50 jews who carried a banner reading 
the temple mount the national symbol of our people is in the 
hands of our enemies the hill called haram essharif in arabic 
is sacred to both moslems and jews 
stores were closed and streets nearly deserted in the occupied 
territories because of an order by the underground palestinian 
leadership for a strike and two days of protest 
antishultz graffiti spraypainted on walls in ramallah said 
the plo refuses the shultz solution and down with the shultz 
solution 
abu jebrin sold bread from cardboard boxes at a street stand in 
the west bank city across from his bakery which he said soldiers 
forced him to close bakeries are exempted from plo strike calls 
in gaza city outlawed palestinian flags flew from rooftops and 
utility poles rashad al shawaa a former mayor dismissed by the 
israelis said electricity was cut off in the city the army denied 
it was done as punishment 
bethlehem usually bustling with pilgrims at easter was like a 
ghost town a lone tourist was seen on the streets at midday 
a dozen arab boys hurled stones at soldiers deployed near the 
main road and 400 bethlehem residents marched through town to

leaders of the nations capital on monday 
marked the rebirth of neighborhoods that were reduced to rubble 20 
years ago by the riots that followed the assassination of the rev 
martin luther king jr 
this is a difficult day for all of us said mayor marion 
barry jr standing in front of a yearold 50 million city 
government building constructed on the streetcorner where the riots 
began were here today to rededicate ourselves to finishing the 
agenda dr king began 
barry who ran a jobtraining program for washingtons 
innercity youth in 1968 said kings assassination led him to 
believe that civil rights progress and neighborhood 
reconstruction would come faster 
many are frustrated that we are celebrating changes that have 
come all too slowly barry said we havent seen the rapid 
reinvestment in neighborhoods that we expected but we have seen 
some progress 
the new government center at which he spoke is one example of 
change but buildings just across the street remain the burnedout 
shells they were after three days of rioting turned the capital 
into a city under siege 
some sections of other neighborhoods have seen very little 
rebuilding and barry blamed the slow reconstruction pace on a lack 
of promised federal and private financing 
the rioting laid waste to vast tracts of three largely black 
neighborhoods as the homes of black residents and the stores of 
white merchants burned and businesses were looted 
the numbers associated with the riots are staggering more than 
1200 homes and businesses were burned with property damage 
conservatively estimated at 247 million more than 7600 people 
were arrested most for looting and 12 people were killed most 
when trapped in burning buildings 
hospitals treated more than 1200 injuries more than 11500 
federal troops reinforced the 2800member district of columbia 
police department to quell the disturbances 
by the time order was restored nearly 25 percent of the citys 
thenpopulation of 810000 needed some form of assistance 
reflecting on the outpouring of anger and violence following 
kings death some city leaders still seem startled by the 
vehemence of the protest 
when the riots got started it caught everyone by surprise 
said sam jordan a city official who lived a block from where the 
riots started about two miles north of the white house 
the tension was there but we had followed dr kings 
philosophy of nonviolence when he was assassinated the anger 
came out 
david clarke the district of columbia council chairman thinks 
it wrong that some think of the riots and king at the same time 
calling kings philosophy and the riots moral antitheses 
clarke said progress in washington since 1968 is not the result 
of a riot it is the result of a movement 
many of washingtons political leaders were active in the civil 
rights movement and worked for changes on both the local and 
national level following kings death 
an elective school board replaced a federally appointed panel in 
1968 and washington residents earned the right to elect their own 
mayor and city council in 1974 
the civil rights movement was the major source of strength 
for our evolving lives barry said we worked hard we lived 
hard always dr king was a great inspiration to all of us

fortythree percent of imported aerosol 
cosmetics contained chlorofluorocarbon compounds banned as 
propellants by the united states 10 years ago the customs service 
said monday 
the noncompliance rate is below some spot checks in the past 
according to don cousins chief of the technical branch in the 
office of technical services in the customs service the figure has 
been as high as 60 percent he said 
customs has never before undertaken anything like the current 
checks in operation ozone which spokesman dennis shimkoski 
said constituted pretty near 100 percent of all pending imports 
the service checked 442 samples of aerosol products since feb 
15 said shimkoski of those 188 contained the offending compounds 
more than 60 different products were represented in the samples 
shimkoski said most were perfumes made in france but deodorants 
baby powders and shaving creams also were found 
shimkoski said the hunch of the service was that most of the 
shipments were not sent to the united states by the manufacturers 
but by middlemen who saw a good deal on something 
the aerosol cosmetics were held up during the lab tests and 
those that flunked could be seized by the service or returned to 
the shipper said shimkoski he said he did not have figures on how 
often each course had been followed 
the united states banned almost all use of chlorofluorocarbon 
or cfc compounds as aerosol propellants in 1978 out of concern 
that they might be attacking the ozone layer 15 to 25 miles high 
that shields the earth from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun 
the 1978 us aerosol ban joined only by canada and some of the 
scandinavian countries was the first action anywhere against cfcs 
it was followed by temporary declines in cfc use and inactivity on 
almost every front except research 
more recently scientists concluded that cfcs most likely are 
responsible for unexplained ozone declines at northern 
midlatitudes ranging from 17 percent to 30 percent according to 
a march 15 report from the national aeronautics and space 
administration and also the halving of ozone over the south pole 
in the spring 
less ozone means more ultraviolet reaching the ground and more 
skin cancer the environmental protection agency has estimated that 
a 1 percent decline in ozone means an eventual increase of 48 
percent to 75 percent in the most common form of skin cancer 
last septembers treaty by major producing nations to cut cfc 
emissions by 50 percent by 1998 means other countries probably will 
make action against aerosols their first step industry analysts 
have said 
about 35 percent of cfcs used outside the united states are used 
for aerosols epa has estimated some 5 percent of us use is 
devoted to aerosols mostly in medical applications for which their 
is no good substitute 
cfcs valued for being nontoxic and nonflammable are also 
used as cleaning solvents in electronics manufacture plastic foam 
blowing agents and as refrigeration fluids 
they were largely replaced in us aerosols by flammable 
hydrocarbon compounds which can slightly promote the formation of 
ozone at ground level where it is a pollutant

ethiopia and somalia which fought 
a fullscale war 11 years ago agreed to restore diplomatic 
relations and discuss border disputes dating back more than a 
century ethiopias foreign minister said monday 
berhanu bahiy released details of a 10point agreement worked 
out between the east african neighbors during the weekend by an 
ethiopian delegation he led and a somali delegation led by deputy 
prime minister ahmed mohamoud farah 
under the agreement the two sides will refrain from the use 
of threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or 
political independence of the other 
the two sides also would move their forces back at least six to 
nine miles from the border the withdrawal is to begin by april 15 
and to be completed by may 15 under the supervision of a joint 
military committee 
both sides agreed to exchange prisoners of war within four 
months and to prevent all acts of destabilization and subversive 
activities against each other somalia and ethiopia have 
supported and harbored rebels opposed to the others government 
ethiopias central government has fought long wars with 
separatists in its northernmost regions of eritrea and tigray 
rebels in both regions last week claimed major victories prompting 
president mengistu haile mairiam to comment publicly on the 
problems for the first time in his 13year rule 
somali president mohamed siad barres government also is 
fighting insurgencies 
any lessening of tension between ethiopia and somalia would free 
troops from the border for redeployment to areas of rebel activity 
in 197778 ethiopia and somalia went to war after somalia 
invaded the ogaden a semiarid region of eastern ethiopia 
populated by ethnic somalis 
previously ethiopia had insisted that the border question be 
included in the agenda but somalia proposed that the two sides 
first restore relations and take other steps before tackling the 
question separately 
berhanu said the boundary question would be discussed later but 
said no date had been set 
the agreement was signed after talks friday and saturday in 
mogadishu the somali capital it is based on a march 30 1964 
pact known as the khartoum agreement 
the 1964 agreement which took its name from the sudanese 
capital where it was signed was never honored by either side 
the 1977 invasion by somalia then backed by moscow sparked a 
war that ended a year later when ethiopias marxist government 
routed the invaders and pushed them back across the border by 
then ethiopia had millions of dollars in weapons from its new 
backer the soviet union and help from cuban troops 
ethiopia had been one of the wests staunchest african friends 
before emperor haile selassie was overthrown in a 1974 revolution 
but moscows switch put addis ababa firmly in the soviet camp 
somalia then sought and received us backing 
ethiopia has the largest military force in black africa but the 
conflict with somalia has been a stalemate since the 1977 war 
despite a technical state of war and some border clashes

leading colombians are proposing that 
the government negotiate a truce with drug traffickers who have 
killed 21 judges and scores of other people in the last four years 
so far the government of president virgilio barco a close 
friend of the united states has vowed to keep on fighting the drug 
traffickers 
but many colombians including the attorney general and two 
roman catholic bishops have called for a truce because the united 
states is not doing enough to help stop the illicit trade 
the us government gave 14 million to colombia last year to 
fight drug trafficking 
in addition to the judges drug traffickers have killed two 
newspaper editors a justice minister an attorney general and 
scores of policemen and soldiers 
after traffickers killed attorney general carlos mauro hoyos in 
february for his battle against drug trafficking barco said his 
government would not be intimidated by the gangsters 
two bishops dario castrillon of pereira and samuel silverio 
buitrago of popayan said in february that the colombian government 
should start talks with the drug traffickers 
recalling the words of president nixon all war is 
political castrillon said we have to look for dialogue in 
order to avoid war 
silverio said drug money could be used to help the poor you 
might as well try to cover up the sun with your hands as deny that 
the economy has not been helped by drug trafficking silverio 
said 
attorney general alfredo gutierrez marquez reiterated in a 
broadcast interview monday that he would not object if the 
government opened talks with drug traffickers 
gutierrez turned in his resignation last week after a news 
report that showed his brother had bought a farm and an airstrip 
from a drug trafficker and that a drug traffickers plane had 
landed there 
the president accepted the resignation gutierrez will stay in 
office until his replacement is appointed there have been no 
reports linking gutierrez himself with drugs 
the mayorelect of medellin juan gomez martinez said last week 
the government should ask for talks with the drug traffickers he 
said the country finds itself at war with the traffickers and in 
a war situation you dont wait for the earth to be scorched to look 
for a way out of the problem 
gomez is the owner of the medellin newspaper el colombiano drug 
traffickers have killed his chief of security shot up his house 
and tried to bomb his newspaper 
colombians have long pointed out that they do not have the 
resources that the united states has for fighting drug trafficking 
colombian antidrug agents often are armed with outdated weapons 
and communications equipment and have only a dozen helicopters 
an air force pilot flying operations against coca plantations in 
the eastern jungles once said the air force doesnt have spraying 
planes able to carry enough fuel and insecticide to reach the 
remote areas 
a us drug enforcement administration agent in colombia said 
colombian agents often had to beg us agents for gas for their 
cars to go on raids 
drug traffickers on the other hand have massive amounts of 
funds fleets of helicopters jets and other planes private armies 
with the latest in submachine guns and other equipment bulletproof 
cars and hundreds of fast boats 
fortune magazine last year reported that two colombian alleged 
drug traffickers are among the richest men in the world it said 
pablo escobar gaviria and jorge luis ochoa each have between 2 
billion and 3 billion

farmers carried 607 billion worth of 
allrisk crop insurance in 1987 on a record 62 million acres of 
production the american association of crop insurers said monday 
e eugene gantz executive vice president of the association 
said farmers paid 274 million in 1987 premiums and received 335 
million in loss payments for the year nationally that meant for 
each 1 paid in premiums farmers received 122 in indemnities 
the multiple peril crop insurance program includes 
commercial companies that are reinsured against catastrophic loss 
by the federal crop insurance corp an agency of the agriculture 
department the fcic also handles insurance directly through master 
marketers who account for about 20 percent of the total 
up to 30 percent of a farmers allrisk insurance premium is 
subsidized by the fcic 
when the federal subsidies are included the 1987 premiums 
totaled 365 million compared with the benefits of 335 million 
thus the 1987 loss ratio was 092 or 92 cents paid out for each 
1 of premium 
gantz said that was the lowest ratio since the multiple peril 
crop insurance program began in 1981 
under the program farmers can buy varying levels of coverage 
for a variety of crops to insure them against loss from floods 
drought insects and other natural causes 
as we look forward to 1988 we hope for another good loss 
ratio performance gantz said but were concerned with dry 
conditions already cropping up in the west and midwest 
the deadline for farmers to sign up for 1988 crop insurance is 
april 15 in most areas of the country it was march 31 in some of 
the early planting areas of the south he said 
farmers who produce springplanted crops also should keep in 
mind that without crop insurance they are not eligible for 
agriculture department disaster assistance such as lowinterest 
loans from the farmers home administration gantz said 
the 1987 coverage on 62 million acres of crops compared with 
607 million acres in 1986 and 465 million acres when the program 
began in 1981 a lowpoint was reached in 1983 when plantings were 
cut sharply by drought and government acreage programs only 313 
million acres of crops were insured that year 
however the mix of crops and variations in kinds of coverage 
have resulted in wide variations of coverage value last years 
607 billion in coverage was down from more than 622 billion in 
1986 for example despite the record acreage and in 1985 
coverage totaled nearly 717 billion on 591 million

jesse jackson appears to have won the hearts 
of wisconsins packinghouse auto and paper workers people he 
calls the victims of economic violence but the states two 
biggest unions remain divided going into tuesdays primary 
the three bluecollar groups in the past year have suffered 
through announcements of plant shutdowns or ongoing attempts to 
replace them with strikebreakers 
jackson alone among the democratic presidential candidates has 
stood on all of their protest and picket lines and well before 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis and tennessee albert gore jr 
stepped foot in the state 
al gore visited us and dukakis showed up at the labor temple 
in green bay last friday said roger murphy one of 370 mostly 
white paperworkers on strike the past 10 months against 
international paper cos mill at depere 
but theyre just reading off the script jesse wrote murphy 
said anybody who belongs to any kind of union will vote for 
jackson he represents our personalities the most 
the depere strike another by 900 united food and commercial 
workers at smithfield foods plant at cudahy and chrysler corps 
plans to close it 5500employee kenosha plant have gotten the 
candidates attention 
and the 6770 workers at all three have clearly sided with 
jackson but there are 220000 other union workers in wisconsin 
and their preferences are unclear according to leaders of their 
unions 
the problem is the people who are striking or are in trouble 
are the ones who vote and those who are working dont said joan 
baggett political director for the bricklayers union and a dukakis 
supporter that raises a real question about us getting a 
novemberelectable candidate 
joel vattendahl head of the united steel workers 13000 
members in wisconsin believes dukakis will get more of their votes 
than jackson as does morris andrews exeuctive secretary of the 
largest union in the state the 48000member wisconsin education 
association 
jackson is turning on the people who dont normally vote 
said andrews a gore supporeter and a member of the democratic 
national conventions platform committee four years ago but hes 
coming from behind and were all over the lot 
the american federation of state county and municipal 
employees with more than 46000 members in wisconsin also is 
divided 
afscme is running wisconsin phone banks for both dukakis and 
jackson in congressional districts where there are black 
population pockets milwaukee madison and racine afscme locals 
have endorsed both dukakis and jackson in the six other mostly 
white areas of the state its endorsement went only to dukakis 
the clear loser labor activists agree in tuesdays balloting 
will be illinois sen paul simon based solely on his win in his 
home state primary may 15 simon now has more labor convention 
delegates than any other candidate 20 according to the aflcios 
latest tabulations 
jackson is second with 15 followed by gore with 10 and dukakis 
with six 
quite sadly wisconsin will show simon to be yesterdays 
tomatoes said vattendahl of the steel workers a union where 
simon has enjoyed the greatest support 
the steel workers were instrumental in persuading simon to stay 
in the race through the illinois pimary and had hoped he would do 
well enough in wisconsin to stay in the race through the april 26 
primary in pennsylvania where the union has its greatest political 
clout 
vattendahl now believes his unions wisconsin members will vote 
dukakis and jackson in that order tuesday despite what he 
called jacksons willingness to get down with the people 
mark rosenbaum president of the ufcw local p40 that is 
striking the cudahy plant has made trips to california to raise 
campaign money on jacksons behalf 
the picket line is white the strikebreakers are black said 
allen zack a ufcw spokeman the company orchestrated letters to 
jackson from scabs saying that he was selling them out and he 
replied a scab is a scab our cudahy people are big jackson fans 
jackson likewise has been endorsed by local 72 of the united 
auto workers that represents the 5500 workers at kenosha after 
visiting it right after chrysler announced in january its intention 
to close the plant next summer 
both gore and dukakis in the past week have denounced chrysler 
chairman lee iacocca but labor leaders view it as too little and 
too late

the soviet union has been given the goahead 
to buy an additional 1 million metric tons of us wheat at 
subsidized prices the agriculture department said monday 
acting undersecretary thomas o kay said that since april 1987 
the subsidized sales of wheat to the soviets have totaled more than 
118 million tons under previously announced allocations of the 
departments export enhancement program or eep 
more than 76 million tons of the 118 million tons of 
subsidized wheat bought by the soviet union has gone to fill its 
commitment under the fifth and final year of a longterm grain 
agreement with the united states 
the pact which expires sept 30 calls on moscow to buy at 
least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that the 
purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and 
corn the soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million 
tons as wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting 
as two tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
if more than 12 million tons are wanted in a year the soviets 
are required to seek us approval the soviets have been given 
approval to exceed the 12 million tons in the final year 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat or soybeans 
if moscow buys all of the new authorization that would push 
wheat sales in the last year of the agreement to more than 86 
million tons all of the wheat has been subsidized 
in addition the soviets have bought 41 million tons of 
nonsubsidized corn 818400 tons of us soybeans and 13 million 
tons of soybean meal 
under eep private exporters are given surplus commodities owned 
by the departments commodity credit corp so they can sell a 
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive 
world prices 
the subsidies or bonuses have run between less than 20 to 
more than 40 per ton roughly 54 cents to 109 per bushel 
officials also said 490000 tons of wheat about 18 million 
bushels were sold to the soviet union under the previous eep 
authorization announced on march 18 the sales were handled by 10 
companies whose subsidies will average 1979 per ton or 54 cents 
per bushel 
the companies and the quantities included continental grain 
co 125000 tons cargill inc 65000 mitsubishi international 
corp 25000 artfer inc 50000 richco grain ltd 50000 
coprostates inc 25000 bunge corp 25000 marubeni america 
corp 25000 tradigrain inc 50000 and union equity 
cooperative exchange 50000 
no prices were announced but wheat has been selling recently 
for around 274 per bushel meaning the us farm value could be 
about 49 million

the number of refugees increased by 15 
million to more than 13 million worldwide last year but their 
chances for finding refuge in the united states and other countries 
diminished a refugee relief group says 
the world refugee survey from the us committee for 
refugees said the number of refugees worldwide increased from 117 
million in 1986 to 133 million last year but many of those 
seeking asylum here were discouraged by harsh immigration and 
naturalization policies particularly in regard to refugees from el 
salvador haiti and indochina 
rather than granting the asylum seeker to present his case 
freely and fairly we seem to do everything in our power to 
prejudge him as a cheat and treat him like a criminal bill 
frelick assistant editor of the report said 
the problem may not be a question of law but it is a question 
of justice 
frelick quoted a report by the congressional general accounting 
office saying that in new york the us immigration and 
naturalization service detained criminal aliens from el salvador 
and haiti along with others 
some guards under contract are charged with lack of vigilance 
gross negligence to duty and suspected collusion in detainee 
escapes 
he also quotes a sworn statement from an afghan he says was 
excluded after six months of detention 
from this jail and the mental torture i have been put through 
it has become clear to me that what i heard about the united 
states is nothing other than a dream and propaganda the united 
states will never extend a helping hand to me 
the signer of the statement is not named 
ins spokesman verne jervis did not immediately respond to 
requests for comment on the report 
a state department official said the united states screens 
fleeing haitians to determine who are political refugees the 
united states has an agreement with haiti that provides 
international access to those sent home to see they are well 
treated 
court robinson the committees specialist on southeast asia 
predicted in an interview monday that the number of indochinese 
brought into this country from camps in thailand will fall short of 
the permitted 29500 in the year ending sept 30 
but the state department official responded that the ceiling 
usually is reached and that another 8500 can come directly from 
vietnam if the vietnamese government permits 
robinson said the thai government had virtually stopped taking 
any more refugees at the end of january thailand already had more 
than 404000 nearly all from the communistruled countries of 
indochina according to the survey 
the survey also reported diminishing opportunities for refugees 
reaching other countries with more resources to take care of them 
canadas government angered by boatloads of undocumented asians 
is pushing through parliament a law that will make it a crime to 
bring them in without proper papers and will permit aliens to be 
detained 
west germany cut applications for asylum almost in half by 
turning away those who had spent more than three months in another 
country considered safe frelick says 
new restrictions are also reported from britain and switzerland 
the number of refugees seeking homes in the united states and 
other western industrial countries is small compared with the 
biggest new wave 350000 who fled to malawi last year from the 
rebellion against the government of mozambique in southeastern 
africa 
at the end of 1987 more than 2 million of these affected 
persons are are physically displaced within mozambique and more 
than 800000 others have sought refuge from the conflict in the 
neighboring countries of malawi zimbabwe zambia swaziland and 
south africa sen edward m kennedy dmass wrote in an 
article in the survey 
though there was no one big movement last year the numbeer of 
afghan refugees in pakistan and iran and of ethiopian refugees in 
somalia and sudan are much greater the survey quotes louis and 
nancy hatch dupree of duke university as putting the total number 
of afghans in pakistan at 32 million with 6000 to 8000 arriving 
every month the survey puts another 22 million in iran 
it estimates that there are 677000 ethiopians in sudan and 
another 430000 in somalia though the last number is disputed 
the us committee for refugees is supported by the ford 
foundation religious groups and charities

the popular myth may be of a caveman 
dragging off his women by her hair but women were probably behind 
many of the major inventions of prehistoric times a researcher 
said monday 
women may be responsible for the major technological 
innovations in prehistory the invention of pottery horticulture 
and agriculture basketmaking weaving and textiles said joan 
gero 
ms gero an assistant professor of anthropology at the 
university of south carolina is one of the organizers of an 
international conference to discuss womens roles in prehistory 
the fiveday conference which opens tuesday at the wedge 
plantation near georgetown is the first archaeological 
conference designed to separate out gender roles in prehistory 
she said 
seventeen researchers including archaeologists 
anthropologists historians and a philosopher will gather for the 
meeting 
included in the group are three noted researchers irene 
silverblatt of the smithsonian institution peter white of the 
university of sydney and henrietta moore an anthropologist from 
cambridge university 
much of what will be discussed flies in the face of the 
conventional wisdom for instance its generally a given in 
archaeological circles that man was the toolmaker in prehistoric 
times ms gero said 
but some researchers are suggesting that based on clues from 
the past and observations of presentday preindustrial societies 
that women were responsible for making tools and pottery 
the irony is that huge chunks of the archaeological record may 
in fact be the result of womens labor ms gero said eighty 
percent of the archaeologists in the world use pottery to sort out 
time periods 
separating the female roles from the male roles in prehistoric 
societies is a real challenge its so hard to do thats why its 
gone so long undone ms gero said 
she noted that while unearthing a pharaohs tomb gives 
scientists clues as to how a small group of people lived were 
looking for half the human race 
one thing we hope will come out of this is an inspection of 
what it means to be female and what it means to be male she 
said we have a notion of females women dont make tools but 
women were responsible for making a lot of stone tools 
often she said people consider the past in terms of their 
present day thinking on what is male and female 
you dont want to say women did exactly what theyre doing 
now she said if we can envision the roles that women played 
in the past that itself is a means to get at what male and female 
mean in different societies

more of the farmers home administrations 
rural development loans may be targeted to areas of high 
unemployment the agriculture department agency said monday 
fmha administrator vance l clark said a proposed change in the 
rules would direct a higher proportion of the agencys business and 
industrial loan guarantees to smaller companies where there is high 
unemployment 
the bampi program involves guarantees by fmha on loans made by 
commercial lenders to provide jobs through new or expanded 
businesses in rural areas 
as a general policy we want to gear the limited bampi loan 
funds to smaller businesses in areas where they can provide jobs 
for rural people especially displaced farmers clark said 
under the proposal loan guarantees would range from 70 percent 
to 90 percent of the loan value with the higher guarantee reserved 
for smaller loans 
a spokesman joe oneill said bampi loan guarantees range up to 
10 million per project those of up to 2 million would carry the

dyers woad a weed that wages chemical war 
against neighboring plants is infesting parts of the west the 
agriculture department said monday 
range scientist james a young of the departments agricultural 
research service facility in reno nev said dyers woad was used 
in europe for thousands of years to make purple dye its seeds may 
have come into the united states in alfalfa seed from ireland in 
the 1920s 
in any case he said in a report issued in washington the 
3foottall weed has taken hold in california oregon utah 
wyoming and idaho and its difficult to eradicate 
young became interested in dyers woad when he noticed it 
spreading into northern california fields already infested with 
other weeds laboratory and field studies showed dyers woad seed 
pods secreted a toxin that killed the roots of nearby grasslike 
weeds including those grazed by cattle 
the process is called allelopathy when one plant species 
secretes a chemical that inhibits the growth of another species 
the only way neighboring plants can be saved from dyers woad is by 
spring rains that soak into the ground and flush away the chemical 
he said 
if the chemical could be synthesized it might be turned into an 
evironmentally safe herbicide but thats all down the road

hundreds of shops and stores reopened 
to little business in panama city on monday ending a twoweek 
strike that failed to remove gen manuel antonio noriegas grip on 
this tense nation 
as the capital began regaining a semblance of normalcy the 
united states prepared to send an additional 1300 military 
personnel to panama the reagan administration said the troops 
scheduled to start arriving tuesday would help safeguard the lives 
and property of american citizens 
the us state department said us ambassador arthur davis 
suffered deliberate harassment when his limousine was chased 
for two miles sunday by a panamanian military patrol car 
the panamanian government denied the charge but did admit that 
the ambassadors car had been tailed in strictly a police 
matter 
justice minister rodolfo chiari de leon said the incident 
occurred when a patrol spotted an exaggerated display of 
automatic arms carried by civilian elements traveling in three 
vehicles that followed the ambassador 
cynthia farrell a spokeswoman for the ambassador acknowledged 
that us security guards were following davis in at least one 
other vehicle she called it a routine precaution but declined to 
give details 
in washington phyllis oakley the state departments deputy 
spokeswoman used the incident to step up administration criticism 
of noriega commander of panamas 15000member defense forces and 
the power behind the civilian government 
we consider any threat to the safety of the ambassador to be 
serious as always she said we will take the necessary steps 
to protect americans i am condemning the incident from the podium 
we regard the action as deliberate harassment 
meanwhile democratic presidential hopeful jesse jackson 
released a letter from noriega in which the general rejected any 
political and economic program dictated from washington dc 
jackson who had sent a letter to noriega on march 22 urging him 
to step down said he would forward noriegas response to congress 
and to the state department 
jackson campaigning for votes in wisconsin said he remained 
convinced that it is in the best interests of the panamanian 
people for gen noriega to leave today i reiterate my public moral 
appeal for him to depart 
the state department reacted with displeasure to the candidates 
exchange with the panamanian strongman 
in our view proliferation of channels is a tactic that 
noriega likes to use to buy time mrs oakley said we have 
available channels of communication with noriega if and when they 
are needed 
noriega has rejected an offer of asylum in a third country in 
exchange for a state department promise not to seek his extradition 
for trial on federal indictments issued in february in florida 
charging him with drug trafficking 
businesses began reopening in panama citys central commercial 
district ending a strike by antigovernment groups however many 
merchants were pessimistic about the economy which has been 
crippled by cash shortages antigovernment unrest and us 
sanctions 
manuel lopez who opened his furniture store for the first time 
since march 19 said his last sale was five weeks ago and he has 
paying his employees partial wages 
we give them food too lopez said it has come to that 
the owner of an electronics shop said he reopened because 
competitors did but asked who is going to buy this kind of 
thing right now 
this is a disaster said the shopkeeper who asked not to be 
identified for fear of reprisals we dont know whats going to 
happen but when noriega goes things will improve right away 
panamas banks have been closed since march 3 creating a 
critical cash shortage the united states has frozen panamanian 
funds held in us banks and imposed other sanctions including the 
withholding of about 65 million a month in user fees for the 
panama canal 
panamanians began a run on banks in late february when noriega 
orchestrated the ouster of president eric arturo delvalle who had 
called for the strongmans resignation 
the panamabased us southern command which already has 10500 
military personnel in the country said a few planeloads of 
additional troops and equipment were expected tuesday afternoon 
with most of the remainder arriving wednesday 
the pentagon said last week that it decided on the buildup 
because of the instability of the current situation in panama 
the heavyhanded tactics of noriega in dealing with the situation 
and the potential for increased threats to us citizens and 
interests

a sentence that requires industrialist victor 
posner to make a 3 million contribution to the homeless is illegal 
and shows the rich can trade money for liberty while the poor 
cannot prosecutors said monday in a challenge to the penalty 
posner pleaded no contest to 10 federal tax fraud counts for 
inflating the value of land he donated to a religious school but 
avoided prison when he was sentenced feb 12 to pay 4 million in 
court costs and penalties plus 3 million to south florida 
homeless programs 
laudable as the project envisioned by this court may be we 
submit it would disserve and cause disrespect for our system of 
justice and only emphasize that the rich can trade money for 
liberty while the poor cannot said us attorney leon kellner in 
a motion filed monday 
a hearing on posners plan for distribution of the 3 million is 
scheduled for wednesday before us district judge eugene p 
spellman 
among the conditions imposed by spellman was that posner could 
not take a tax deduction for the donation and that he could not 
file for voluntary bankrutptcy 
spellman said he would have no comment on the motion and was 
awaiting a response by posners attorneys 
a federal court cannot order a convicted defendant to make a 
charitable contribution of money to a nonaggrieved person as a 
condition of probation said kellner 
the court can only ask not demand that posner make the 
donation and cannot incarcerate him if he fails to do so kellner 
said 
sadly we are compelled to observe that this sentence is 
illegal the prosecutor said 
the motion says spellman stated that if any of the special 
conditions were violated it would result in posner having to serve 
a prison sentence although the court did not indicate what its 
sentence would otherwise have been 
the government does not believe that posners acceptance of the 
terms changes the illegality of the sentence prosecutors said 
the law does not allow an exchange of money for jail time 
even for the benefit of a badly needed societal purpose said the 
motion

romania is asking for concessions to offset 
the effects of its unilateral renunciation of special trade 
privileges with the united states us sources close to the talks 
said monday 
the state department announced that talks were held last week in 
washington with a romanian trade delegation to assess the effects 
of romanias decision to renounce its most favored nation trade 
status 
the decision announced in february means that on july 3 all 
romanian exports to the united states will be taxed as much as 40 
percent compared with 3 or 4 percent previously 
romania which has implemented severe austerity measures 
estimates the lost privileges will cost it 250 million in export 
revenues from the united states which amounted to 775 million in 
1987 the romanians sell the united states wooden furniture small 
engines leather textiles and aluminum products 
the romanian decision appears to have been motivated by its 
reluctance to ease human rights restrictions in return for the 
favored trading status which most other communist countries do not 
enjoy the united states has accused romania of suppressing free 
speech religious practice and political organizing 
the us delegation at last weeks trade talks stressed that 
issues of human rights would continue to be a central part of the 
usromanian dialogue and that positive movement on such matters 
would be an important factor permitting progress in other areas of 
our bilateral relations the state department said 
the statement also said both sides agreed to hold future 
highlevel consultations on trade and human rights issues us 
officials refused to further discuss the talks 
however two us sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said romania had asked for special concessions the sources did not 
elaborate on what romania had specifically sought during the two 
days of talks 
romanian deputy foreign minister olimpia solomonescu who led 
her countrys negotiating team indicated she had not won any 
concrete concessions from the us side one source said 
but she said she felt it was a good start for future talks 
he added 
while romania is no longer eligible for us trade concessions 
it has other bargaining chips such as its nonaligned foreign 
policy 
for instance romania is the only communist country to have full 
diplomatic ties with israel in the past theyve been able to use 
this independence from moscow to win favors here said a source 
but this may be less effective with the openness of the soviet 
blocs foreign policy under the glasnost regime of kremlin leader 
mikhail gorbachev he added

four british boys in the alps for a 
school outing left their group while climbing in the snow monday 
lost their footing and slipped over a precipice falling hundreds 
of feet to their deaths officials reported

youngsters set off at lunchtime without skis to climb a mountain 
near untersberg a village on the border with west germany

started sliding around in the snow lost control and went over the 
precipice police spokesman alois wintersteller said it appeared 
they were playing

andrew watts 14 michael taylor 13 and daniel howton 14 all 
pupils of the altwood church of england school in maidenhead in

nobody was really there to see exactly what happened so we 
dont know said one police spokesman who asked that his name

were recovered by helicopter he said the boys fell between 150 and 
650 feet

cbs said monday it was disappointed that the 
us supreme court let stand a record 3 million judgment in a 
libel lawsuit brought by a cigarette manufacturer 
the libel award was the largest ever upheld on appeal said 
henry kaufman of the libel defense resource center in new york city 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the judgment 
for brown amp williamson tobacco corp violated the rights of the 
network and walter jacobson anchor for wbbmtv a chicago station 
owned and operated by cbs 
were disappointed doug jacobs associate general counsel 
for cbs inc said on behalf of the network and wbbm we believed 
these issues were important enough for review 
theres no way that i with malice or forethought told a lie 
on television its never happened and it never will jacobson 
said monday adding that the case hasnt inhibited me as long as 
i can tell the truth and be fair im not affected 
were pleased that the good name of the company and its people 
have been vindicated said michael bateman a spokesman for the 
louisville kybased cigarette maker 
brown amp williamson maker of viceroy cigarettes accused cbs and 
jacobson of libeling it in a nov 11 1981 broadcast 
jacobson in a nightly feature called walter jacobsons 
perspective said there was a viceroy advertising strategy to 
attract young people to smoking by linking cigarettes to pot 
wine beer and sex 
he said the idea was to present cigarette smoking as an 
initiation into the adult world as an illicit pleasure 
the cigarette maker denied the allegation it said a 
prebroadcast denial to wbbmtv was not incorporated into 
jacobsons commentary 
kaufman the libel expert said the award was nearly four times 
larger than the previous standard an 850000 judgment against 
the outlet co which he said operated a television station in 
texas 
he said most multimilliondollar jury awards against news media 
defendants are thrown out or reduced on appeal with those upheld 
averaging between 100000 and 150000 
this is the first libel award that has broken through the 
psychological 1 million barrier on appeal the first that has been 
able to make it through the process intact kaufman said 
a federal trial in the case ended in november 1985 with a jury 
award of 5 million to brown amp williamson 
in august the 7th us circuit court of appeals in chicago 
rejected cbs arguments that the broadcast was intended as opinion 
and thus could not be libelous upholding 3 million of the award 
against cbs and 50000 against jacobson 
the appeals court found the remarks about viceroy were presented 
as factual even if the tone of the broadcast suggested an 
editorial 
the 7th circuit also rejected cbs claim that the broadcast was 
truthful 
in his statements about the marketing strategy jacobson cited 
what he said was a confidential report prepared by the federal 
trade commission but the court said the ftc report did not make 
such allegations and the jury was entitled to find that jacobsons 
broadcast was not a fair summary 
finally the appeals court ruled that jacobson and cbs acted 
with actual malice in broacasting the commentary 
for a public figure to win a libel suit it must be shown there 
was actual malice that statements were made with knowledge they 
were false or with reckless disregard for the truth the tobacco 
company was considered a public figure for purposes of the suit 
the 7th circuit court said that after the libel suit was filed 
a researcher for jacobson destroyed documents that might have 
supported the cigarette companys case 
a court and a jury are entitled to presume that documents 
destroyed in bad faith while litigation is pending would be 
unfavorable to the party that has destroyed the documents the 
appeals court said 
jacobs the cbs attorney contended the original federal court 
juy put too much stock into the destruction of documents issue 
cbs already has paid brown amp williamson 34 million to cover 
the libel award and interest

attorney general edwin meese iii faces an 
ethics investigation by the justice departments office of 
professional responsibility department sources said monday a 
process that ultimately could result in a recommendation to 
president reagan that meese be fired 
investigators in opr which monitors potentially illegal and 
unethical behavior inside the department began examining meeses 
ties to longtime friend e robert wallach last year and whether 
they constitute unethical conduct said the sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
that review was halted when independent counsel james mckay 
launched his criminal investigation of meese last may 11 the 
sources said 
however the head of opr michael shaheen denied through a 
justice department spokesman terry eastland that his office had 
conducted such an examination of meesewallach ties last year 
the files of former assistant attorney general william weld on 
meeses dealings with wallach were moved to opr last friday said 
the sources confirming a report in saturday editions of the 
washington post material collected by welds criminal division 
last year led to mckays criminal investigation of meese 
upon completion of mckays probe opr is prepared to delve into 
whether meeses actions at wallachs behest on behalf of 
scandalplagued wedtech corp and a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline 
may have violated a 1965 presidential order on ethic standards for 
executivebranch employees the sources said 
mckay said friday that if he decides not to seek a criminal 
indictment of meese the independent counsels office will refer 
all of those matters for review and action by the appropriate 
administrative authorities a reference to opr 
opr has the power to recommend a range of options including 
docking of pay suspension or dismissal 
the executive order on ethics prohibits using public office 
for private gain giving preferential treatment to any organization 
or person losing complete independence or impartiality of 
action and making a government decision outside official 
channels 
from our standpoint based on what we know there has been no 
violation by mr meese of any ethical regulation or guidelines in 
any of the affairs that the independent counsel has been looking 
into said one of meeses lawyers james rocap 
for there to be speculation before the matters have been 
referred to these agencies is in my view irresponsible specious 
unfair and unwarranted 
reagan has made it clear that he is strongly supportive of 
meese despite the nearly 11month probe of the attorney general 
and the resignations last week of weld and deputy attorney general 
arnold burns who reportedly were concerned that the investigation 
is hurting the departments operations and its image 
but any adverse recommendation from oprs chief shaheen would 
be another political embarrassment to the reagan administration and 
produce renewed cries for meeses resignation 
justice department sources supplied the following instances by 
meese suggesting possible use of public office for private gain 
preferential treatment of wallach loss of independence or 
operating outside channels in potential violation of the ethics 
order 
in 1981 and 1982 wallach sent to meeses home about a dozen 
memos touting wedtech corp which was trying to obtain a 32 
million nobid defense contract to build small engines for the 
army meese interceded on the companys behalf an act that 
culminated with the contract going to wedtech wallach now under a 
racketeering indictment in the wedtech scandal collected 13 
million from the company from 1981 to 1986 at the time he received 
the memos meese was white house counselor 
in may 1985 wallach then representing swiss oilman bruce 
rappaport sought meeses assistance in boosting the iraqi oil 
pipeline meese referred the matter to thennational security 
adviser robert mcfarlane which culminated in a meeting of wallach 
rappaport and mcfarlane meese later advised thenisraeli prime 
minister shimon peres to meet with mcfarlane rather than secretary 
of state george shultz on the pipeline 
a 150000 payment from rappaport to wallach wound up being 
used for pooled stock trades by meeses financial manager w 
franklyn chinn the stock trading got meese a 40000 profit on an 
investment of just 50000 in 18 months before the meesechinn 
partnership came under fire in congress last summer and was 
dissolved wallach had introduced meese to chinn who sat on 
wedtechs board of directors in 1985 and 1986 
sources said shaheen is among a number of justice department 
personnel who in recent months have been contemplating resigning to 
protest meeses refusal to step down in the face of the ongoing 
criminal investigation 
shaheen however has decided to stay on for now and is 
preparing to look into mckays referral to his office said the 
sources 
but through eastland shaheen on monday denied that he had been 
contemplating leaving at any point 
while mckay may decide not to seek an indictment of meese he 
will compile a report that is expected to provide a mountain of 
detail about meeses involvement with wallach according to one 
source familiar with the case 
such a report would provide a foundation for shaheen in 
evaluating ethical questions said the justice department sources 
under shaheen opr found several years ago that meeses 
predecessor william french smith had breached a 
conflictofinterest standard by investing in an oil and natural 
gas exploration tax shelter that used a tax benefit calculation 
method disapproved by the internal revenue service 
as a result of another probe by shaheens office smith in 1984 
repaid the government for use of an official car by his wife 
in a 1980 inquiry shaheen concluded that billy carter brother 
of thenpresident carter lied to government agents who were 
investigating whether he was required to register with the justice 
department as an agent of the libyan government 
shaheen also said thenattorney general benjamin civiletti 
dissembled at a july 24 1980 news conference at which he 
denied any white house contacts on the billy carter case the 
following day civiletti acknowledged the conversation with the 
president

tunisia if the united states used that country to attack libya the 
libyan news agency reported 
jana monitored in rome said gadhafi also told the visiting 
tunisian prime minister and cabinet that he ordered a division of 
troops withdrawn from the border with tunisia 
the troops were sent to the border prior to the new tunisian 
governments taking power last nov 7 because gadhafi believed the 
united states intended to use tunisia to attack libya the agency 
said 
prime minister hedi baccouche of tunisia and his countrys 
council of ministers came to libya for talks with libyas cabinet 
gadhafi said he also will insist on opening the artificial 
borders with egypt and withdrawing military forces from that 
frontier as part of his quest for a unified arab nation 
jana quoted gadhafi as telling the meeting to bolster 
confidence fraternity security and safety among the brothers in 
libya and tunisia i announce the dismantling of the badr 
formation which was to act inside tunisian arab territories if 
america used tunisia against libya 
he was quoted as saying the formations weapons were being 
presented as a gift to the tunisian arab armed forces 
he hailed the tunisians who came to power nov 7 as being 
among those who prevented america from using tunisian arab 
territories against libya the agency said 
he was referring to the removal of 84yearold president habib 
bourguiba who made tunisia one of the most westernized nations in 
the arab world 
zine el abidine ben ali an army general and then the prime 
minister said in november that bourguiba was incapacitated by age 
and health and cited a constitutional provision in taking power 
ben ali now is tunisian president 
gadhafi also said he was abolishing the border gate with 
tunisia starting monday arabs in both libya and tunisia can 
enter and go out without this gate standing in their way jana 
quoted gadhafi as saying 
he expressed regret that president hosni mubarak of egypt had 
rejected the opening of the borders and said he would send a 
letter to egyptian parties and organizations demanding the border 
be opened the agency reported 
whoever refuses to open the borders means that he has not will 
at hand or reflects his fear for the zionists and the americans 
who fill egypts streets jana quoted gadhafi as saying 
if the present egyptian rulers are unable to achieve these 
unionist proposals others will achieve them victory will be for 
these proposals as for those who oppose them they will end in the 
dustbin of history

the world jewish congress said monday it found 
highly unlikely a report that president kurt waldheim of 
austria saved allied prisoners from execution while he was a german 
army officer 
bruce ogilvie a 66yearold former fighter pilot was quoted by 
the sunday times as saying waldheim saved him and other prisoners 
from being passed to the nazi ss when he met them on nov 19 1943 
at an airfield outside athens 
the british office of the world jewish congress said waldheim 
returned to the headquarters of german army group e in arsakli near 
salonika on oct 4 1943 after completing his duties in athens 
300 miles away 
it said waldheim received leave papers nov 20 to start a rest 
leave nov 23 in austria 
due to this chronology it is highly unlikely that waldheim 
had anything to do with mr ogilvies story the organization 
said in a statement 
ogilvie was quoted as saying he was found armed and in civilian 
clothes nov 17 1943 on the germanoccupied greek island of leros 
he was quoted as saying the germans took him to an airfield 
outside athens where he met waldheim who introduced himself by 
name and made sure ogilvie and others went to a pow camp instead of 
to the ss which shot prisoners 
prime minister margaret thatchers government has ordered an 
inquiry into the cases of six british commandos executed in 1944 
after being delivered for interrogation to the germany army unit in 
which waldheim served 
a panel of historians found that waldheim was in close 
proximity to nazi atrocities during army service in the balkans 
knew of them and did not try to stop them but it left open the 
question of whether he committed war crimes waldheim has denied 
wrongdoing

thousands of radical students fought 
riot police in clashes at two seoul colleges monday and others were 
reported to have attacked a passenger train with firebombs and 
rocks 
at sungkyunkwang and konkuk universities in seoul hundreds of 
riot police fired tear gas to block antigovernment students from 
marching into the streets no arrests or injuries were reported 
in the southern city of chinju press reports said a passenger 
train was caught in a clash between police and about 1200 students 
the korean news agency yonhap said most passengers escaped 
unhurt but that a student barrage of firebombs and rocks shattered 
at least 300 train windows and destroyed some seats 
the violence at chinju followed an antigovernment rally at 
nearby kyongsang university where students were protesting weekend 
police action 
students said dozens of people were hurt saturday when police 
firing tear gas stormed the kyongsang campus to disperse about 
3000 students and workers demanding a freer labor movement and a 
boycott of agricultural imports 
about 1200 students from hankook university occupied a road in 
seouls southern shopping center monday after boycotting a oneweek

aggression by accepting us demands to open south korean

protests were organized by leftists trying to overthrow the 
government by force

republicans in the election i think we have to recognize its 
going to be an uphill battle for republicans in iowa this year 
he said 
iowa has struggled through years of a farmbased recession and 
republicans have had problems as democratic ranks expanded in 
protest of gop farm policies

democratic presidential candidates jesse 
jackson and sen paul simon of illinois oppose opening the shoreham 
nuclear power plant on long island according to material released 
monday by sen daniel p moynihan dny 
shoreham should not be opened in large part because of 
the inherent problems of any possible evacuation in the event of an 
emergency simon said in a letter to moynihan jackson spokesman 
hulbert james told moynihan aides that jackson is against opening 
the 5 billion plant 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee and massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis were more cautious but both said they would support 
legislation to forbid the nuclear regulatory commission from 
licensing the plant without an emergency evacuation plan approved 
by the federal emergency management agency 
fema has said long island could not be safely evacuated without 
the cooperation of state and local officials who have refused to 
participate in such planning however the nrc changed its own 
rules last year to allow it to assume state and local officials 
would cooperate in any actual nuclear emergency 
the candidates responded to a march 31 letter in which moynihan 
asked their position on legislation he offered last year to require 
the nrc to abide by femas decision the bill lost in committee

the government will stop supporting more than 
3000 performing arts companies and let them make their own way in 
the marketplace an official newspaper said monday 
the plan worries some in chinas 56 minority groups who fear 
losing their cultural heritage the englishlanguage china daily 
said it appears to be in keeping with recent steps away from the 
20yearold iron ricebowl policy guaranteeing workers food 
shelter and clothing regardless of their output 
gao zhanxiang vice minister of culture said china will move 
slowly in reforming the management and structure of arts companies 
the newspaper reported he said 210000 professional performers 
will be affected 
recent developments show the need for reform gao said and 
proclaimed it the only way to revive and develop the performing 
arts 
li moran a wellknown stage actor contended the plan would 
throw products of the performing arts into the market as 
commodities china daily reported 
critics were quoted as saying it would leave funding available 
for only modern arts leaving the traditional and minority fields 
completely on their own 
members of traditional and minority musical dance and opera 
troupes have been especially furious with the proposed plans 
china daily said 
under the current system central and local governments control 
hiring budgets and choice of programs under the new one 
companies would have financial autonomy but the government still 
would set culture and entertainment policy 
china daily said most arts companies are overstaffed and 
performers are paid according to seniority it said chinese theater 
has not satisfied the popular needs and lamented the loss of 
talented artists to foreign countries arts in china suffered 
heavily during the 196676 cultural revolution against 
intellectuals which leading chinese directors and actors say 
created a shortage of able young performers 
the cultural ministry said it will sponsor a national conference 
next month to establish procedures for the reforms

separatist leader to cooperate with an agreement intended to end 
the rebel war with the sinhalese majority the indian ambassador 
said monday 
jn dixit said velupillai prabhakaran leader of the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam asked for the money in new delhi last july 
to replace taxes his militia collected from people in jaffna 
the main tiger stronghold in northern sri lanka

tamil war began in 1983 
the newspaper indian post reported the payments in an article 
sunday in confirming the story dixit said he did not know the 
amount given prabhakaran but it was enough to take care of his 
requests at that point in time 
an unidentified tiger spokesman was quoted in the post as saying 
the agreement with india was for 384600 a month but no payment 
was made after the first month by then the tigers were 
criticizing the peace accord 
gandhi negotiated the agreement after trying for nearly three 
years to mediate peace between the tamils and the government

eastern sri lanka 
about 60 million tamils live in india most of them in tamil 
nadu state across the narrow palk strait from sri lanka most

meetings in new delhi before the peace agreement was signed 
the tigers did not sign the accord but agreed to give up almost 
all their arms the agreement calls for the rebels to disarm in 
exchange for greater tamil autonomy

a federal judge denied a defense motion 
monday to dismiss three counts of a ninecount indictment against 
the matriarch of a polygamist clan that held police at bay in a 
13day standoff 
vickie singer is charged along with her son john timothy 
singer clan leader addam swapp and his brother jonathan in the 
bombing of a mormon chapel and the standoff that ended in a gun 
battle jan 28 
they are to go on trial wednesday 
addam swapp was wounded and corrections lt fred house was 
killed when the siege reached its bloody climax at marion utah 
in the fifth day of pretrial hearings mrs singers defense 
attorney kathryn collard argued that three counts against her 
client should be dismissed because the bombed kamas stake center 
chapel was not involved in interstate commerce but rather in 
religious activities 
that would imply that the three counts which include charges of 
bombing attempting to kill federal officer firearms violations 
assault and conspiracy would not fall within federal jurisdiction 
collard said 
however assistant us attorney richard lambert argued that the 
statute was meant to be given a broad interpretation and that a 
clause citing federal jurisdiction over any bombed building 
should apply 
lambert said the stake center clearly was used for a variety of 
interstate commerce activities including collections that 
ultimately go into the church general fund for use throughout the 
nation and the world a linkage to a worldwide satellite system 
and an international missionary network that begins at stake 
centers 
collard countered that only businessrelated activities 
constitute commerce and that church officials certainly would not 
consider their activities as part of business 
they take the position what they do is a furtherance of their 
religious mission so they wont be taxed she said 
the bombing of the mormon chapel allegedly was in revenge for 
the death of mrs singers polygamist husband john singer who was 
killed in a confrontation with authorities nine years ago swapp is 
married to two of singers daughters and was a leader of the 
family along with mrs singer they blamed the mormon church of 
which their group is an offshoot and police in singers death 
swapp claimed a violent confrontation at the familys rural 
compound would bring about singers resurrection

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said monday he could find no consensus for a middle east peace 
conference as called for by the general assembly 
there has been strong support in the united nations for an 
international peace conference that would include the palestine 
liberation organization 
israel however refuses to deal with the plo maintaining it is 
a terrorist organization determined to destroy the jewish state 
the united states also rejects official contacts with the plo 
and while supporting an international conference says it should 
only prepare for direct negotiations between israel and its arab 
neighbors 
in a report issued monday perez de cuellar noted the us and 
israeli positions and said sufficient agreement does not exist 
either amongst the parties directly concerned or with the security 
council to permit an international conference 
meanwhile the recent and continuing events in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip have dramatically highlighted the urgent 
need for the negotiation of a comprehensive just and lasting 
settlement of the arabisraeli conflict he said 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip have been rioting 
since dec 8 against israeli occupation 
the general assembly passed a resolution in december calling for 
a unsponsored peace conference that would include the plo and 
the five permanent members of the security council the united 
states soviet union britain france and china 
washington is pursuing its own middle east peace initiative and 
secretary of state george p shultz is now in the region on his 
second tour within the past month

a judge began a painstaking series of 
interviews monday with about 100 prospective jurors for the retrial 
of a defendant originally sentenced to death in the notorious alday 
family slayings 
superior court judge hugh lawson said he expected the jury 
questioning for the retrial of wayne carl coleman to last at least 
through friday 
coleman is one of three men who were convicted of six counts of 
murder in the case in 1974 and sentenced to die those convictions 
were overturned in 1985 by a federal appeals court which said 
publicity about the case in tiny seminole county made it impossible 
for the three to get fair trials there 
defense lawyer robert h citronberg referred to colemans 
original trial in arguing that potential jurors should not see 
seminole county sheriff jerry godby in the courtroom while they are 
being interviewed for the retrial in dekalb county 
lawson refused to bar godby saying prospective jurors were 
unlikely to notice him since he was not in uniform 
the judge then began calling prospective jurors one at a time 
asking them if they had any moral objections to the death penalty 
and if they could make the lifeordeath choices in a capital 
murder case 
citronberg and fellow defense lawyer tom west asked if the 
prospective jurors would be sympathetic to a defendants mental 
condition deprived upbringing and alcohol or drug abuse 
lawson called the questioning a preliminary screening procedure 
with final selection of jurors possible next week the jury will be 
sequestered for one to two weeks of testimony in the trial the 
judge said 
coleman his halfbrother carl isaacs and george dungee were 
escapees from a maryland prison when they were arrested for the 
slayings of six members of the ned alday family in extreme 
southwestern georgia 
alday his brother and three sons were shot one by one on may 
14 1973 when they arrived at the home of one of the sons where 
coleman and his companions were interrupted in a burglary 
according to testimony 
the wife of one of aldays sons was taken to a wood six miles 
away where she was raped and killed 
isaacs was again convicted of murder and sentenced to death in a 
retrial in perry in january dungee is to be retried in columbus 
after colemans retrial

followers of martin luther king jr 
marched monday to the motel where he was assassinated 20 years ago 
and promised to keep fighting to reach his promised land by 
calling attention to the plight of the poor 
until we wipe out poverty in the ghetto nowhere can be safe 
nowhere can be secure for one hungry person speaks in misery to 
everybody said joseph lowery president of the southern 
christian leadership conference a civil rights organization 
founded by king 
there aint going to be no peace in the suburbs until there is 
justice in the ghetto lowery told about 3000 people who marched 
a mile and a half through downtown memphis to the lorraine motel 
king was assassinated on april 4 1968 while in memphis to 
support a strike by city sanitation workers he also was conducting 
a nationwide campaign to draw attention to poverty 
the day before he was shot king delivered his last public 
address saying ive been to the mountain top and ive seen 
the promised land i may not get there with you but i want you to 
know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land 
fifty members of lowerys organization were scheduled to leave 
from the motel monday on a combination march and motorcade through 
mississippi alabama and georgia but the poor peoples 
pilgrimage was delayed a day because two mules did not arrive on 
time 
the mules are a symbol of poverty lowery said and a wagon they 
were to pull is similar to one used for kings funeral in atlanta 
the lorraine itself has become something of a symbol of poverty 
at one time the motel had about 60 rooms but the decaying 
twostory building had only 12 rooms in use when the state closed 
it in january to make way for a museum opponents of the museum 
project say the money should be spent turning the lorraine into 
housing for the homeless 
darmy bailey a memphis lawyer who spearheaded a push to get 
88 million from the state and local governments for museum said 
the project will be a fitting tribute to king 
see the years of neglect that have gone on at this holy 
site bailey said what kind of tribute has that signaled 
about the struggle for which that great man gave his life 
prior to the march to the lorraine the city held a memorial 
service in kings honor at the orpheum theater a downtown 
landmark the service included gospel singing songs by a group of 
grammar school children and a dance titled love has no color 
it was the first citysponsored memorial to the slain nobel 
peace prize winner 
mayor richard hackett who appointed the commission that 
organized memphis first memorial for the slain civil rights 
leader said it is time for the city where king died to better 
organize its efforts to help the poor 
twenty years ago dr king spoke of a dream today this city 
recognizes the necessity for that dream to become a reality 
hackett said it is right it is just and it is in the best 
interest of us all 
the sanitation workers protest that drew king to memphis set off 
a tense and sometimes violent confrontation between strikers and 
city police gerald mcentee international president of the 
american federation of state county and municipal employees said 
the sclc march on the 20th anniversary of kings death showed that 
those conflicts have lessened greatly 
this time the mayor of memphis tenn and the members of 
local 1733 will be walking arm and arm we are together mcentee 
said there could be no more fitting memorial to the man were 
here to honor and for the dream he died for 
william lucy international secretarytreasurer of the union 
said he was especially encouraged by the performances of the 
youngsters taking part in the king memorial 
this is what dr king had hoped for that in the future it 
would be young people to bring about change lucy said there 
may be some folks in memphis who think that change isnt even 
within their capacity 
but the children will make it happen

national leaders of the assemblies of 
god have taken no action on jimmy swaggart following the 
evangelists most emotional church speech since he stepped down 
from the pulpit a denomination spokeswoman said monday 
swaggart received a favorable response sunday night from the 
crowd at his family worship center but officials of the assemblies 
of god said his appearances during easter services would have 
violated the terms of a oneyear ban on preaching it ordered last 
week 
taking the microphone briefly during sunday nights service 
swaggart paced and shouted into the microphone 
it works it works he said shaking a bible as he does 
when he preaches if there is a reporter here spread the word 
everywhere it works 
the rev everett stenhouse assistant general superintendent for 
the assemblies of god said swaggarts appearance would have 
violated the oneyear ban 
but because swaggart has not signed any agreement he has not 
submitted to the churchs rehabilitation program stenhouse said in 
a telephone interview from springfield mo the churchs national 
headquarters 
the churchs general presbytery last tuesday banned swaggart 
from the pulpit for at least a year for moral failure a 
selfdescribed prostitute has said swaggart paid her to pose nude 
for him 
swaggart must decide this week whether to accept the 
disciplinary action a choice that could affect the future of his 
financially troubled ministry he said through his attorney last 
week that he will defy the order and return to the pulpit may 22 
juleen turnage a national church spokeswoman criticized 
swaggarts appearances sunday and said he probably would face 
expulsion if he did not quickly accept the churchs discipline 
i know our executives want to give him sufficient time to 
respond to their written notification and i would think that maybe 
by the end of this week if they have not heard from him the 
executives will be looking at what further steps they can take to 
bring this to a close she said 
the 13 members of the denominations executive presbytery held a 
telephone conference on monday but took no action turnage said 
we still have not heard from jimmy swaggart were still 
waiting to hear turnage said 
swaggart spokeswoman leanne weill said monday that swaggart had 
not sent the denomination a response and had not set a date for 
doing so 
after an earlier service sunday morning swaggart launched into 
a talk on the love of christ when a reporter asked if he was 
leaving the assemblies of god 
a heckler had disrupted the morning service to accuse the 
evangelist of hypocrisy 
brother swaggart your hypocrisy is scornful of the government 
of god the young man about 16 years old yelled during a brief 
lull in the service 
swaggart who has not been preaching since tearfully confessing 
to an unspecified sin on feb 21 was sitting on the churchs stage 
at the time of the outburst with his wife frances and other 
church leaders swaggart did not visibly react to the heckler 
the rev jim rentz who has taken over as pastor watched the 
youth for only a moment and then told worshipers lets stand 
folks and lets just praise the lord 
rentz and the congregation drowned out the youth until he was 
escorted away by ushers during his brief outburst the youth also 
referred to immoral sins and money 
the incident came after swaggart spoke briefly as he introduced 
a musical duet

two members of president reagans cabinet and 
four members of congress have written letters of support for lyn 
nofziger to the judge who will sentence the former presidential 
aide for illegal lobbying 
the letters from energy secretary john s herrington and labor 
secretary ann mclaughlin were among 62 from current and former 
government officials that were filed monday with a defense memo 
that urged nofziger serve a period of unsupervised probation 
letters also were sent by sen chic hecht rnev reps jack 
kemp rny helen delich bentley rmd mervyn dymally 
dcalif exsen paul laxalt rnev and former health and human 
services secretary margaret m heckler now ambassador to ireland 
in one letter secret service director john r simpson vouched 
for the defendants reliability and integrity recalling when 
nofziger became the white house spokesman after president reagan 
was shot on march 30 1981 
once mr nofziger took the podium simpson said he was 
quickly aware of the rapport and trust the press had for any 
statements he made 
nofziger 63 is scheduled to be sentenced friday by us 
district judge thomas flannery for illegally lobbying on behalf of 
wedtech corp a maritime engineers union and the manufacturer of 
the air forces a10 antitank plane 
the former white house political director could receive a 
twoyear prison term and be fined as much as 10000 for each of 
the three felony convictions for lobbying excolleagues within a 
year of leaving the presidents staff 
in its filing nofzigers lawyers accused independent counsel 
james c mckay of making a vindictive and meanspirited 
request for imprisonment the defense said a prison term would 
unnecessarily add to the degradation and humiliation mr nofziger 
has already suffered as a result of his indictment and trial 
it is inconceivable that a sentence other than probation is 
appropriate under these circumstances said the sentencing memo 
filed by defense lawyers robert plotkin and e lawrence barcella 
the letters attached to the sentencing memo were from current 
and former reagan administration officials personal friends and 
political associates of nofziger who vouched for his character and 
integrity 
he has always been a man who cares more for the good of a 
cause than for personal gain wrote kemp who urged the judge to 
balance the requirements of justice with the quality of mercy 
in a threepage letter herrington urged flannery to show 
compassion and understanding for nofziger 
society has been paid by what he has gone through in this 
trial and the effect that it has had on him as an individual the 
secretary said 
lyn nofziger will never engage in this activity again in any 
way shape or form and my fear is that he will probably never 
participate in politics again and i think that will be a shame 
herrington said 
in a memo filed last week mckay said nofziger had unjustly 
enriched himself after leaving the white house in early 1982 
amassing a current net worth of 28 million 
mckay said nofziger deliberately ignored the ethics in 
government act restrictions on lobbying and showed no remorse after 
his conviction in february 
plotkin and barcella said nofzigers legal bills total 14 
million and will increase when the conviction is appealed 
the defense said nofziger does not dispute the need for fair 
clear and balanced postemployment restrictions but contended 
that if the statute were clearer mr nofziger likely would not 
be before the court for sentencing

an electronic signal system to 
find lost climbers was unveiled monday and dedicated to nine people 
who died on mount hood two years ago 
two young climbers who survived the states worst mountaineering 
disaster attended the ceremony the frustrating search for 
survivors led to an effort to develop and pay for the tiny signal 
devices to be worn by climbers 
every now and then it unfortunately takes a tragedy to make us 
aware of needs that always existed us sen bob packwood 
rore said at the ceremony 
seven teenagers and two faculty members from the oregon 
episcopal school in portland died in may 1986 after getting lost in 
a blizzard near the summit of the 11235foot peek about 50 miles 
east of portland four climbers survived 
the us forest service estimates more than 10000 people climb 
mount hood each year since 1896 more than 50 people have died on 
the mountain 
the signal system called the mount hood locator unit consists 
of a small 8ounce transmitter that is worn on a harness over the 
climbers torso when the climber is lost he or she pulls a cord 
to activate a continuous beep over a vhf radio frequency 
when the climber is reported overdue search and rescue groups 
can use special receivers to pick up the beep which grows louder 
the closer the receiver gets to the transmitter 
the batterypowered transmitter will send the signal at least 20 
miles and can be picked up under 6 feet of snow and as deep as 75 
feet in an open crevasse 
brinton clark now 17 made her first public statement since the 
tragedy and thanked those who took part in the search two years 
ago your dedication is the reason im here today she said 
giles thompson now 18 of longview wash lost both legs to 
frostbite and was interrupted by applause when he announced he 
planned to go skiing 
and i wouldnt be going skiing if it wasnt for the efforts of 
a lot of people he added 
a hundred transmitters will be available for climbers to rent 
for a maximum of 5 at any of six mountaineering shops in the 
portland area said scott russell cochairman of the mountain 
signal memorial fund use of the device is not mandatory 
the device was developed by telonics inc of phoenix ariz 
although similar devices have been used to track wildlife 
companies had not adapted one for human use because of the 
potential liability if the device should fail 
organizers of the signal fund convinced the oregon legislature 
to pass a liability exemption last year

secretary of state george p shultz on monday 
sidestepped differences with prime minister yitzhak shamir on a 
middle east peace conference and kept a us plan alive by focusing 
on palestinian selfrule 
we do have a sense of movement a senior us official told 
reporters after shultz met separately with shamir foreign minister 
shimon peres and defense minister yitzhak rabin 
a senior israeli defense official however said the government 
remained deadlocked and the only way to gain acceptance of the plan 
would be for shultz to persuade king hussein of jordan to accept it 
i feel it can bring about a change the official told 
american reporters in a briefing held under rules that barred 
identifying him 
in another development israel television said monday night that 
israel and the united states were preparing a new memorandum of 
understanding to serve as an official basis for strategic 
political and economic cooperation 
it said the memorandum will be signed by president reagan and 
president chaim herzog in separate ceremonies in washington and 
jerusalem on may 21 the 40th anniversary of israels independence 
the report did not elaborate on the memorandum 
shultz will hold talks with hussein in amman on tuesday return 
to jerusalem with a report for israeli leaders and shuttle back to 
the king on wednesday 
the us plan calls for three years of selfrule but not 
statehood for the 15 million palestinian living in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip negotiations on an overall settlement 
would open in december 
although shultz set a midmarch deadline for a reply israel 
jordan and syria have all held back neither accepting nor 
rejecting the us plan 
after shultz met with shamir for two hours monday a spokesman 
for the prime minister said they were still in disagreement over a 
middle east peace conference and talks shultz held with two members 
of the palestine national council in washington nine days ago 
but the spokesman avi pazner said there was more 
convergence between shultz and shamir on palestinian selfrule 
and an overall settlement 
similarly peres said after his twohour session with shultz 
that he believed we moved forward even if the road is still long 
we went beyond the international conference 
peres told reporters we talked about the substance and form 
of an interim agreement 
shultz meanwhile said he was encouraged that we have now 
engaged in this initiative in the important aspects of its content 
namely direct facetoface negotiations 
despite reassurances from shultz that the united states would 
stand by israel shamir contends an international conference would 
offer an opportunity for the soviet union to get in the way of 
direct negotiations with the arabs and impose an unacceptable 
settlement 
shultz on his second visit to the area in a month also offered 
assurances the united states would oppose a palestinian state and 
counter efforts to force israel to retreat to its pre1967 borders 
however he emphasized sunday that negotiations must be based on 
un security council resolution 242 which calls on israel to 
yield west bank and gaza territory 
shamir described his meeting with shultz as a very good and 
basic discussion 
shultzs plan for arabisraeli negotiations has failed to defuse 
palestinian unrest in the west bank and gaza 
in amman meanwhile more than 500 moslem fundamentalist 
students chanting shultz the devil should go home burned us 
and israeli flags in a protest rally monday on the jordan 
university campus 
there were other demonstrations in the arab kingdom where 
palestinians are in the majority shultzs plan would include 
palestinians approved by the palestine liberation organization in a 
joint delegation with jordan 
syria the plo and egypt have called for a direct role for the 
plo in the negotiations while husseins position is not known 
according to some us accounts he has accepted the idea of a 
joint jordanianpalestinian delegation 
but reporters traveling with shultz last month to amman were 
told jordan wanted plo participation 
according to un figures 137 palestinians and an israeli 
soldier were killed in clashes since dec 8 there was one 
palestinian death on monday 
the israeli defense official who briefed reporters said israeli 
forces were trying to reduce the level of violence but we have 
to drive home to the heart and mind we mean business and want 
tranquility 
with the israeli cabinet evenly divided on whether to accept or 
reject shultzs plan the official said its future very much 
depends on the attitude of the other parties jordan is the key 
if hussein accepts shultzs proposal in principle the israeli 
official said i feel it can bring a change

a soviet newspaper on monday linked western 
broadcasts and an armenian dissident to ethnic violence in the 
republics of armenia and azerbaijan 
the communist newspaper pravda called armenian nationalist 
paruyr ayrikyan who is under arrest a former criminal who has 
engaged in the fanning up of national division it said ayrikyan 
and the western news media are like siamese twins 
pravda specifically criticized the british broadcasting corp 
the voice of america and radio liberty for their coverage of the 
riots and protests in the two soviet republics and said 
their masters have their own interest here they hope to put 
an end to socialism by dragging it piecemeal to separate national 
compartments in the same stride they try also to defame 
restructuring in our society and the process of its 
democratization 
ayrikyan who was a political prisoner for 17 years emerged as 
a spokesman for activists shortly after armenians began 
demonstrating feb 13 for annexation of the nagornokarabakh region 
from neighboring azerbaijan he traveled to moscow and held two 
news conferences for foreign journalists 
western journalists have been barred from traveling to armenia 
and azerbaijan and telephone calls to the region go through only 
sporadically 
nagornokarabakh has been part of the mainly moslem azerbaijan 
republic since 1923 although more than threequarters of the 
regions 160000 residents are armenians most of whom are 
christians 
the annexation issue touched off rioting in the azerbaijan city 
of sumgait that left 32 people dead officials confirmed that most 
of those killed were armenians 
instead of agreeing to the annexation demand the communist 
party and government offered a 690 million program of improved 
housing and social services such as armenian language schools and 
television broadcasts in armenian 
ayrikyan 38 was leader of an underground armenian nationalist 
group called the national unification party and was jailed for 17 
years beginning in 1969 for his political activities he now is 
chairman of the alliance for national selfdetermination 
a foreign ministry spokesman last week confirmed that ayrikyan 
had been arrested but said he did not know on what charge 
ayrikyans relatives told moscow dissidents that he was charged 
under a law that prohibits spreading of false information 
discrediting the soviet union

a sweeping ordinance restricting or banning 
smoking in most new york city public places goes into effect 
wednesday but officials say it may take months to sort out the 
rules and effects 
the measure the result of six years of battle restricts 
smoking in workplaces restaurants banks hospitals hotels 
theaters large stores and even taxicabs 
but enforcement is likely to be clouded by unclear wording in 
the ordinance delays in related regulations and conflicting 
messages from the health department 
youre talking about a complex social change in a city of 8 
million people said dr stephen joseph city health 
commissioner you dont expect a social change to take place at 
the stroke of midnight 
some of the confusion has been sown by josephs own department 
it opened a phone line to take questions on the new law and an 
operator mistakenly told a caller last week that the law has been 
postponed until further notice 
hotel restaurant and business associations say their members 
have been briefed and are prepared to obey however reluctantly 
for the past few weeks they have been pulling their hair out 
trying to figure out what to do to comply said cynthia r 
darrison head of the restaurant league of new york 
under the ordinance restaurants with more than 50 seats there 
are perhaps 5000 of them must ban smoking at half the tables 
in its most farreaching section businesses with more than 15 
employees must provide nonsmoking work areas designated by signs 
and issue written policies on smoking 
but the regulations for signs are not out yet and the written 
policies are not due until july 5 and the result has been 
confusion in the business community 
irwin s davison health department counsel said the city will 
allow a twomonth grace period before issuing tickets which carry 
fines up to 500 for repeat offenses 
even after june the department intends the ordinance to be 
chiefly selfenforcing meaning it hopes the public will keep 
employers and shopkeepers in compliance joseph said 
the ordinance defines a smokefree workplace as one at least 
eight feet from a smoker some companies call that arrangement too 
difficult to configure or enforce 
the new york post is banning smoking entirely in its offices so 
will the associated press 
we dont feel its right to allow smoking for people who have 
offices and ban it for people who dont said wick temple ap 
director of human resources its a matter of fairness 
for restaurants breaking dining rooms into smoking and 
nosmoking areas means regular customers may have to change their 
habits if they want their usual tables and there could be a line 
for one area while tables are free in the other 
this is new york you could have fistfights in restaurants 
said ms darrison of the restaurant league

japanese sanctions against north korea imposed 
after the disappearance of a south korean airliner last november 
have blocked chances for the return of two japanese sailors held by 
north korea it was reported monday 
north koreas official korean central news agency said the 
japanese governments attempts to negotiate the return of the 
sailors through third countries following its ban on direct 
contacts with north korean officials were a shameless and crafty 
trick to mislead public opinion at home and abroad 
the two crewmen from the ship fujisanmaru no 18 were seized in 
1983 when the vessel returned to north korea after an earlier 
voyage during which a north korean stowed away aboard the ship and 
disembarked in japan 
the crewmen were held for years without trial apparently to 
reinforce north korean demands for the return of the stowaway and 
then were convicted last year on spying charges and sentenced to 15 
years in prison 
although japan has no formal diplomatic relations with communist 
north korea foreign ministry officials said the two sides held 
talks several times last year on the fate of the crewmen 
but in january japan imposed sanctions on north korea 
including restrictions on contacts between official 
representatives following the nov 29 disappearance of a korean 
air jetliner carrying 115 people the plane disappeared while 
flying over burma and south korea claimed north korean agents had 
planted a bomb aboard the plane 
japan also blamed north korea which denied any involvement 
the japanese government itself blocked the road of the 
solution of the crewmens problem by severing contact between 
north korean and japanese diplomats the korean central news 
agency said in a dispatch monitored in tokyo

reagan administration officials gently rebuked 
democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson on monday for his 
contacts with panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega 
contending that such communications could prolong his hold on power 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the 
proliferation of channels is a tactic noriega likes to use to buy 
time 
she added we have available channels of communication with 
noriega if and when they are needed we think it would be best to 
continue to use these channels exclusively 
jackson disclosed that he sent a letter to noriega on march 22 
urging him to depart panama he said a response he had received 
from noriega will be sent to secretary of state george p shultz 
and appropriate members of congress 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater traveling with president 
reagan in california professed bewilderment at jacksons 
activities saying we havent heard from jesse so were not 
sure what kind of a proposal he has made we just dont know 
what he has in mind 
fitzwater said he was confident that noriega will resign 
the economic sanctions are in place we think their impact 
will be significant and things are only going to get more 
difficult there for noriega fitzwater told reporters covering 
reagan while the president vacations at his ranch near santa 
barbara 
jackson appearing monday in milwaukee renewed his call for 
noriega to leave panama and released a letter in which noriega 
rejected any political and economic program that will be dictated 
from washington dc 
my duration as commander and chief of the defense forces is 
governed by the panamanian constitution and law of the defense 
forces noriegas letter said 
while releasing the letter jackson renewed his call for noriega 
to step down 
i remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the 
panamanian people for general noriega to leave today i reiterate 
my public moral appeal for him to depart jackson said 
jackson told reporters he spoke by telephone monday afternoon 
with highranking state department officials who offered no 
disagreement with his appeal for noriega to leave 
he said the officials john c whitehead the deputy secretary 
of state and michael h armacost undersecretary of state for 
political affairs made no suggestion that he should tone down his 
efforts or be more cautious in dealing with noriega 
on sunday jackson had said during a campaign stop in denver 
that he had offered to do whatever he could to facilitate 
noriegas exit from panama but he ruled out a mediating role for 
himself 
jackson said a friend cirilo mcsween of chicago had gone to 
panama at his request to meet with noriega jackson described 
mcsween as a friend of 20 years who was originally from panama 
using rhetoric from his recent speeches jackson said us 
policy has been misguided 
weve set the forest on fire to smoke one person out he 
said referring to us economic sanctions that have contributed to 
a financial collapse in panama jackson said he did not plan a trip 
to panama 
fitzwater also criticized jacksons involvement in the noriega 
matter we have a bipartisan coordinated plan for dealing with 
noriega thats why its important to congress and the public and 
we believe its been working he said 
jesses been involved in a number of these kinds of mediation 
efforts hes offered to go to libya and cuba and all kinds of 
places fitzwater said 
asked about published accounts over the weekend in which deposed 
panamanian president eric arturo delvalle rejected any notion of 
us military force to get noriega out fitzwater replied he 
says that because he thinks the economic sanctions are working 
that we just need to give these things a chance to kind of 
percolate through the system rather than try to take any more 
action 
fitzwater reiterated that the united states plans no further 
immediate steps beyond the economic sanctions and the deployment 
tuesday of an additional 1300 us military forces to the troubled 
country 
he said the troops were to reinforce our security efforts in 
panama to make sure we have the capability of protecting american 
citizens there if that should become necessary but theres no 
steps beyond that at this point 
mrs oakley meanwhile escalated the administrations criticism 
of panamanian authorities over an incident sunday in which us 
ambassador arthur davis was pursued for two miles in panama city by 
a government military vehicle with its siren blaring 
we consider any threat to the safety of the ambassador to be 
serious as always she said we will take the necessary steps 
to protect americans i am condemning the incident from the podium 
we regard the action as deliberate harassment 
embassy spokesman terence kneebone said davis was leaving the 
home of vatican ambassador jose sebastian laboa when the panamanian 
vehicle began following immediately picking them up right 
outside the gate he said it tried to stop the chauffeurdriven 
car with its lights and sirens 
the ambassadors driver in accordance with instructions did 
not stop the ambassador was driven to his residence and the other 
vehicle followed all the way kneebone said the residences are 
about two miles apart

sen paul simon campaigned in a motorcycle 
factory monday in a final bid to rev up his faltering presidential 
bid in time for the wisconsin democratic presidential primary on 
tuesday 
im going to do well here tomorrow insisted simon but 
polls have suggested he is running well behind massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis and jesse jackson 
simon has indicated he needs a good showing in wisconsin in 
order to continue his campaign his only victory has come in his 
home state of illinois 
voters simon said should send this message were not going 
to follow the pollsters were going to elect the man best 
qualified to be president 
al gore agrees with that too simon added referring to sen 
albert gore jr of tennesse polls indicate gore like simon is 
lagging behind the two frontrunners 
theres no question the pollsters have shifted to a 
jacksondukakis race partly because of what happened in 
michigan simon said 
jackson scored a 21 victory over dukakis in michigan on march 
26 
simon shook hands with workers at harleydavison co the 
nations largest domestic producer of motorcycles he noted 
government revisions on import rules are credited with helping the 
company improve its share of the american market in the face of 
japanese competition 
the international trade commissions role in helping commerce 
and employment could be strengthened simon said 
weve had bankers and academicians and all sorts of people 
what we need is some labor representation on that commission he 
said 
simon was asked his opinion of jacksons tactic of making 
appearances in kenosha de pere and other wisconsin cities in 
sympathy with workers on strike or facing layoff 
he said he does not want to criticize jackson but said of his 
rivals strategy there is no question it is based in part on 
rhetoric and not on programs

a university of florida lab says it is 
using video equipment to identify the remains of crime victims in a 
technique more sophisticated than that used in the case of nazi 
deathcamp doctor josef mengele 
forensic anthropologist william r maples who works at ufs 
florida state museum said monday he superimposes on a video screen 
xrays of the victims skull and photographs taken during his or 
her lifetime 
in one recent case maples said the method allowed the 
identification of a girl who had never had a medical or dental 
xray taken in her life such xrays often are used to identify a 
victim with a high degree of certainty 
by superimposing the girls class picture and an xray of the 
skull maples could precisely align the teeth jaw bone and 
openings for the eyes ears and nose 
without this technique the only evidence we have is the 
general age sex race and height of the body and that the 
skeleton was found shortly after the girl disappeared maples 
said thats not very convincing 
the museums ca pound human identification laboratory is the 
only one in the country with such equipment he said 
experts had questioned the identification of nazi war criminal 
mengele in brazil in 1985 because comparisons were made between 
photographs of mengele as a young man and those of an older man 
presumed to be him dental evidence later established the skeletal 
remains as mengeles maples said 
photographs and skulls were manually superimposed in the 
darkroom as early as the 1930s but forensic experts often settled 
for inexact results because of the dozens of tries required to 
align the two images he said 
video equipment has been used in the 1980s with little success 
because most of the work was done by studio technicians not trained 
in forensics he said 
maples said the comparison of photos and xrays on 
highresolution video equipment is an important tool 
we cant rely on dental xrays alone because there may be 
none people may have lost their teeth years after the xrays were 
taken or teeth may be destroyed in a fire plane crash or other 
disaster he said 
maples said the technique confirmed his identifications in a 
case in which a man and womans skeletal remains were found in a 
burned shack in high springs 
a suicide note in an abandoned car nearby linked the couple with 
the slaying of the womans parents in new hampshire and maples 
said he was able to confirm their identities by comparing teeth and 
bone fragments from the fire with xrays of the couples teeth and 
bones 
the new hampshire attorney generals office agreed with the 
identification of the woman but isnt convinced in the case of the 
man prosecutors there are keeping open murder warrants against the 
man citing the possibility he faked his suicide

iraq had used both mustard gas and nerve gas several times in the

hospitalized in baghdad the capital the iraqi government 
requests your excellency to send a mission immediately to iraq to 
see the wounded and to get acquainted with the details of the

a federal judge on monday rejected a 
request that he free a gunman who took 84 people hostage in a 
school at tuscaloosa then surrendered after getting a purported 
pardon from the governor 
the public interest is not served by allowing someone to 
profit by his own misconduct us district judge sam pointer jr 
said in dismissing a complaint by james harveys public defenders 
harvey put down his guns and surrendered after a 12hour siege 
feb 2 at west end christian school shortly after he was shown a 
videotape of a phony pardon by gov guy hunt 
pointer said after a 60minute hearing that harvey had no legal 
right to keep hostages or to refuse to surrender 
the judge also said hunt had no right to grant pardon or 
immunity since the state has a board for that purpose 
one of harveys attorneys mike cornwell had argued that the 
governor used means that cause dishonor to society 
he said the court should hold the governor to a higher level 
of integrity than was shown that day 
attorney general don siegelman told the court any agreement 
between hunt and harvey was not binding and that enforcement of it 
was not a constitutional right 
criminals have no legal right to negotiate by threatening the 
lives of children he said the state however does have a 
right to give false promises when necessary to protect the lives of 
innocent children 
a siegelman assistant susan russ said it was important to 
vindicate the right of the governor to do what he did 
she also said that no pardon can be granted until a person is 
convicted 
bargaining she said is nothing more than a law enforcement 
tool the governor could have used deadly force as a tool 
hunt ms russ said was the one being pressured because harvey 
was holding the children hostage 
she said the contract by hunt should not stand because it 
was obtained under duress 
ms russ also said hunt had no option that he was almost 
forced to make this promise to avoid possible bloodshed 
ms russ said harvey still has all his rights to a fair trial 
albert miles an assistant to cornwell contended that harvey 
had a fundamental right to trust the word of the government 
after pointers ruling cornwell gave notice that he plans to 
appeal

university in palo alto because of widespread protests there 
since then the los angeles real estate firm of blakeleyswartz 
donated a 100acre site near the community of simi valley for the 
library but the site impinges on a greenbelt area that is 
protected from largescale development by a decadeold nonbinding 
agreement among simi valley moorpark and thousand oaks 
mrs reagan was driven to the new site during a california 
vacation last august and approved it the president gave his 
approval after flying over the site the library planners said

a 25pound lobster with claws the size of 
baseball mitts that was saved from becoming an easter dinner 
arrived in maine on monday on the final leg of a roundabout journey 
back to the sea 
maine marine officials gently placed shirley a male 
estimated at 40 to 125 years and a 19pound companion lobster 
into a 600gallon tub of icy saltwater after their flight from 
philadelphia freed from their icepacked travel boxes the 
lobsters immediately began moving their giant claws around 
very good hes moving around already thats a good sign 
col robert fogg chief of the bureau of marine patrol of the maine 
department of marine resources said of shirley a real weak 
lobster would be very lifeless 
theyre excellent im pleased with the way theyve shown up 
marine officials planned to return the crustacean behemoths to 
the atlantic early tuesday off cape elizabeth if they remained 
healthly overnight 
this is symbolic of what were trying to do and what citizens 
are trying to do for a natural sustainable resource fogg said 
by protecting these large lobsters theres more of a chance of 
them reproducing and perpetuating the industry 
maine law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five 
inches covering lobsters larger than 4 to 5 pounds 
if the lobsters health deteriorated during the night and they 
could not be saved lt joseph fessenden of the maine bureau of 
marine patrol said the largest would be turned over to the maine 
state museum 
theyre looking for a lobster to stuff he said 
shirley and the companion lobster had been trucked to 
philadelphia from long island ny and sold for 287 after 
crustacean rights advocates took up the cause kevin hill owner of 
hills main line seafood co in the suburb of ardmore persuaded 
the buyer to take 45 pounds of smaller lobsters instead 
hill put the lobsters in a window tank for the rest of their 
visit to philadelphias main line he acknowledged that saving 
lobsters from dinner palates was something new for him which is 
all right 
he also said that the lobsters had been good business as 
thousands of peole dropped by for a look at shirley 
its been very good for business if they dont buy now at 
least they know where we are said hill who planned to travel to 
maine to be on hand for the lobsters release into the atlantic 
hill delayed packing the lobsters for their trip until the last 
possible minute believe it or not im still getting people 
coming by the window to look at em he said monday 
pity not cruelty inc a small animal rights group made 
arrangements with maine officials to turn the creatures loose and 
assumed the 40 flight cost 
if it seems to be a lot of fuss over a couple of lobsters group 
vice president gloria felschercohen makes no apologies 
why not these two lobsters have survived hazards 
particularly shirley over 100 years she said why should she 
need to succumb to the cruelest predator of all man

a former wedtech corp executive testified 
monday that the scandalplagued defense contractor tried 
unsuccessfully to sell military equipment to iran iraq and saudi 
arabia 
the negotiations to sell bridge pontoons and other supplies 
eventually fell through with all three nations said former wedtech 
vice chairman mario moreno 
moreno in his 14th day of testimony at the racketeering trial 
of rep mario biaggi dny and six others was questioned by 
defense attorneys about wedtechs middle east dealings 
the jury was not present during questioning on that topic and 
us district judge constance baker motley later ruled it 
inadmissible 
the judge said the testimony would unduly prejudice the jury 
because there was no evidence a crime had been committed 
in other testimony the defense tried to throw some doubt on 
morenos previous testimony that biaggi had demanded 5 percent of 
wedtechs stock in return for his law firms assistance in 
obtaining nobid government contracts 
they pointed out that in a february 1987 interview with federal 
prosecutors moreno said another wedtech official wanted to give 
the stock to the biaggi and ehrlich law firm in exchange for unpaid 
legal services 
biaggi his former law partner bernard ehrlich and five others 
are charged with turning wedtech a nowbankrupt bronx defense 
contractor into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions 
of dollars in bribes 
wedtech grew from a small machine shop into a multimillion 
dollar manufacturer through a federal program that set aside 
contracts without competitive bidding for companies controlled by 
minority group members 
prosecutors claim biaggi and others helped wedtech falsely 
portray itself as a minority concern eligible for the nobid 
program 
defense attorney dominic amorosa asked moreno if wedtech had 
acted on behalf of the us government in the middle east 
no we were acting as wedtech said moreno one of four 
exwedtech executives to plead guilty to state and federal 
corruption charges 
the witness said wedtech sought to sell military equipment to 
iran in 19821983 and to iraq in 19841985 adding we believed 
we could do it legally 
you knew you could never legally have gotten an export license 
to sell military equipment asked amorosa 
it crossed my mind said moreno 
asked if e robert wallach a close friend of attorney general 
edwin meese iii had said he could help obtain export licenses 
moreno replied it never got to that point 
moreno previously testified that wedtech paid wallach 800000 
for his influence with ed meese although no wrongdoing by meese 
has been established 
moreno also said a former meese financial adviser w franklyn 
chinn was helping with wedtech negotiations with the iraqis 
chinn was a conduit in trying to sell arms to iraq said 
moreno 
ive never heard this allegation before and i continue to 
deny that frank chinn has engaged in any illegal conduct said 
cristina arguedas chinns lawyer when called at her berkeley 
calif office 
both wallach and chinn are under indictment with a third man 
chinn business associate r kent london accused of extracting 
payoffs from wedtech for allegedly influencing meese and other 
officials

prosecutors subpoenaed 90 witnesses and 
planned to present a chain of circumstantial evidence as testimony 
began monday in the trial of an airline pilot charged with killing 
his wife and running her body through a rented wood chipper 
prosecutors say they can connect richard b crafts 50 of 
newtown with the murder of his 39yearold wife helle a flight 
attendant 
crafts an eastern airlines pilot is accused of killing his 
danishborn wife in november 1986 shortly after she told him she 
planned to get a divorce she was last seen on nov 18 1986 when 
friends drove her home following a flight from west germany 
the prosecution which doesnt plan to say how crafts killed his 
wife said it will present medical evidence that includes body 
fragments found near a lake close to the couples home 
the defense contends that the state doesnt have enough proof 
that the mother of three young children is even dead the 
prosecution says crafts ran her body parts through the wood chipper 
to cover up the crime 
the case was moved from danbury the western connecticut 
jurisdiction where the crime allegedly occurred to this coastal 
city because a judge decided that pretrial publicity would 
prevented him from seating an impartial jury 
crafts also a former parttime police officer in newtown and 
southbury has been held in lieu of 750000 bail since his arrest 
nearly 15 months ago 
before testimony began monday judge barry schaller ruled that 
the prosecution cannot use as evidence wood chips and a clump of 
tissuelike material with human blood seized from crafts car 
however schaller said he will permit evidence taken from the 
crafts home including 51 firearms carpet samples and a pair of 
mens shoes 
states attorney walter flanagan who had characterized evidence 
taken from the car and home as crucial said after the judges 
ruling it was obviously a significant piece of evidence 
defense attorney j daniel sagarin had argued that investigators 
improperly seized the evidence 
a private investigator hired by mrs crafts a stewardess for 
pan american world airways to obtain evidence about her husbands 
alleged infidelity filed a missing persons report on dec 1 1986 
an attorney who was handling mrs crafts divorce case testified 
during pretrial hearings that she told him he should be suspicious 
if anything happened to her 
in court monday mrs crafts mother elisabeth neilsen of 
denmark testifying through an interpreter turned over a series of 
letters she had received from her daughter in 1986 
in the letters read outside the presence of the jury mrs 
crafts said she had told her husband she wanted a divorce and that 
he was seemingly not happy about the idea she also said she no 
longer trusted him 
schaller said the parts of the letters in which mrs crafts 
described her husbands reactions wouldnt be allowed as evidence 
the state medical examiners office issued a death certificate 
on feb 6 1987 listing the cause of mrs crafts death as 
unknown the certificate was based on an examination of body parts 
including a piece of a tooth and a piece of a finger found by 
police

a judge bowed to objections from news 
organizations and lifted an order barring reporting on jury 
selection monday at the cocainesale trial of john zaccaro jr son 
of former vice presidential candidate geraldine ferraro 
the 24yearold zaccaro is charged with selling a quarter gram 
of the drug to an undercover officer two years ago while a senior 
at middlebury college the offense carries a penalty of up to five 
years in prison and a 10000 fine 
zaccaro on monday entered the courtroom separately from his 
parents ferraro and john zaccaro sr as the longdelayed trial 
began but they sat immediately behind their son 
in questioning of at least seven potential jurors monday none 
said ferraros candidacy would have any affect on how they would 
judge her son 
several panelists expressed strong sentiments about drugs one 
juror who was dismissed said id probably be the one going to 
jail if i catch someone selling drugs to my kid 
judge francis mccaffrey after a meeting with attorneys had 
imposed an gag order and said only six reporters could attend jury 
selection he said that he expects the process to last three days 
and that any information published could prejudice the jury pool 
it is important that we get an impartial jury that is where 
you persons have become an issue mccaffrey told the 11 reporters 
in the courtroom clearly segregated voir dire is appropriate in 
this case 
however after an afternoon hearing on a challenge from several 
news organizations mccaffery lifted the order but he said only 
six reporters would be allowed in the room during the proceedings 
and they would have to share their information 
robert hemley a lawyer representing media organizations 
including the associated press had told the judge there would be 
publicity regardless of whether the questioning of jurors was 
public 
the issue then is what is happening in the voir dire 
process that is different or more damaging than previous pretrial 
publicity hemley said 
zaccaros lawyers charles tetzlaff and thomas sherrer had 
requested the order and addison county states attorney john quinn 
did not object quinn said he also was concerned about the jury 
pool noting that the case has received widespread publicity 
because of ferraros prominence 
zaccaro is charged with sale of a regulated drug for allegedly 
selling cocaine to undercover agent laura manning after she came to 
his offcampus apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs 
zaccaro also had been charged with possession of cocaine with 
intent to sell based on evidence police had found in zaccaros 
car including eight grams of cocaine and documents described as 
records of drug transactions 
but the charge was dismissed because of problems with the search 
warrant and the lack of other evidence to prove the charge 
the case has wound its way slowly through the vermont courts 
zaccaros attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and 
claimed unsuccessfully that zaccaro was singled out for prosecution 
because of his famous mother who ran on the democratic ticket in 
1984 with walter mondale 
tetzlaff and sherrer were unsuccessful in having the case thrown 
out altogether the vermont supreme court refused to dismiss the 
charges

noreigas letter to jesse jackson as released monday by the 
jackson campaign it was written in response to a march 23 letter 
from jackson the text as released by the campaign contained 
several fragmentary sentences misspellings and other 
irregularities 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
with sincere emotion i read your most attentive letter 
addressed to me dated march 23 delivered by cirilo mcsween in 
which you expressed your moral concern for the political and 
economic living conditions of the panamanian people your concern 
for the crisis which has provoked great suffering and your appeal 
to me to persist in seeking peace and to put an end to this crisis 
you expressed your anxiety to do whatever is possible to help 
alleviate the suffering and that we should act immediately 
your reputation as a great moral authority obligates me to give 
consideration and pay attention to your appeal so that we may work 
together for the peace and unification of my country in this 
sense i manifest that it has always been one of the objectives of 
the defense force and mine to try to keep social peace for the 
panamanian brothers and sisters and the foreigners that reside in 
our country our doctrine of national security is inspired in the 
ideals of social justice and not of military concepts 
i am sure that you are aware of the deep internal and external 
aspects of the political and economic situation now they have been 
destabalizing our consitutional panamanian institutions so as to 
have a country that is weak and ruined so it becomes an easy prey 
for the dictates of foreign forces i am sure that you know the 
details of the amalgam between professional panamanian politicians 
that are now dressed in sheepskin and the legislative and 
executive sectors of the united states of america who have 
translated an open and barefaced intervention into the internal 
affairs of panama with the final proposition that they do not give 
compliment to the covenant of the torrijoscarter treaty of 1977 
no panamanian with a firm nationalistic and patriotic sentiment 
would ever accept that the solution of internal problems of the 
republic of panama be dictated from washington dc 
consequently i find it unnecesary to repeat this answer to your 
letter with more details in the wheel of the panamanian crisis 
there is something that has awakened my curiosity and come to my 
attention how is it possible that the reagans administration who 
has publicly made gala of great love for god and have profound 
religious sentiment has campaigned terrible economic sanctions that 
have been imposed on the panamanian people causing the kind of 
suffering that you feel sincerely inhuman causing the threat of 
brutal military forces the sabotage the psychological war against 
a materially small and weak country but a dignified coungry just 
like panama is 
manuel solis palma is the actual head of state of panama by 
constitutional decision of the legislative assembly it is 
recognized by the supreme court of justice he has recently called 
for a sincere national dialogue between all the sectors of the 
panamanian society with the purpose of a specific solution for the 
democracy of our country with upcoming celebration of free and 
open elections of may 1989 
the defense forces support this cause by the panamanian chief of

the reagan administration on monday scuttled 
attorney general edwin meese iiis plans to designate a justice 
department deputy as the new head of the criminal division sources 
said and meeses choice for the departments no 2 post said he 
may not take the job 
the two men were to have filled posts being vacated because of 
the resignations of two of meeses top aides 
arlin adams the philadelphia lawyer who had been the attorney 
generals choice to fill the justice departments no 2 post says 
he told meese on monday that he is not optimistic that he will 
be able to take the job 
in an interview adams said that his colleagues at his law firm 
take a very dim view of my leaving at this time because he is 
handling an extensive caseload in philadelphia including a major 
antitrust case and i dont want to leave the firm in the lurch 
adams who would be succeeding deputy attorney general arnold 
burns pointed out that he resumed private practice just last year 
after stepping down from the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
ive not made a decision on whether to accept the justice 
department post but im not optimistic and i told the attorney 
general that today said adams 
meanwhile a justice department source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that james ik knapp 45 a deputy assistant 
attorney general in the departments tax division is being removed 
from consideration to fill the post formerly held by assistant 
attorney general william weld 
the white house on friday held up meeses plans to announce the 
replacements for weld and at least one other aide pending 
completion of background checks 
department sources declined to say why knapps name was being 
removed from consideration and a reporters telephone messages 
left at knapps home were not immediately returned 
a justice department news release had been prepared last week 
containing knapps name as meeses choice for the post said the 
sources 
burns and weld resigned out of concern that the 11monthold 
criminal investigation of meese was hurting the justice 
departments operations and image 
asked whether he had any qualms about serving under meese adams 
said that i look at the job as serving the united states 
government and the department of justice i really dont know the 
background of the allegations concerning meese 
of the investigation of meese he said that it would be much 
better if that did not exist but that is not dominating my 
decision 
he said that when justice department officials called me down 
to washington on thursday almost right away i told them that i 
was honored to be asked 
meese had been prepared on friday to announce the replacement 
for weld and at least one other top justice department vacancy the 
post held by associate attorney general stephen trott who is 
leaving to become a federal appeals court judge 
francis a keating ii assistant treasury secretary for 
enforcement is to take the no 3 department job being vacated by 
trott justice department sources said late last week 
earlier monday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that 
we have received some names we are processing the normal fbi 
clearances but theres nothing out of the routine fitzwater 
made the comments in santa barbara calif as president reagan 
vacationed at his nearby ranch 
meese who is the subject of criminal investigations is trying 
to rebuild the top echelon of the justice department in the wake of 
the resignations of burns and weld 
asked monday if there had been any highlevel white house 
discussions of the political ramifications of meeses legal 
problems fitzwater said no 
he also said i dont know of any plans for reagan to discuss 
the subject directly with meese his longtime friend and aide 
of the choices to succeed burns and weld who resigned last 
tuesday fitzwater said there are some names that have been 
floating around in the press but at this point we have not 
received formal nominations 
the candidates to succeed burns weld and trott will go 
through the white house and the president will announce his 
intention to nominate fitzwater said 
meese is leaving the country wednesday for a weeklong trip to 
south america to speak to officials there on drugrelated matters 
independent counsel james mckay who has been conducting a 
criminal investigation of meese since last may 11 said friday he 
did not plan to seek an indictment of meese based on the 
evidence developed to date 
this news heartened reagan according to white house officials 
who noted that the president has steadfastly supported his 
embattled attorney general 
but two white house officials were quoted in the los angeles 
times monday as saying they thought meese should step down 
these officials who were not named by the times said the 
attorney general had become a political liability for reagan and 
for the republican party 
they said they were discussing the meese situation despite 
orders by white house chief of staff howard h baker jr to 
maintain silence on the matter

when evan mecham became governor of 
arizona in january 1987 he was on top of the world a millionaire 
auto dealer who finally had become king of the political hill on 
his fifth try 
fifteen months later the firstterm republicans career is in 
ruins after he was impeached and ousted from office 
his term was marked by a firestorm of controversy that began 
even before he took office 
he was criticized for cancelling a holiday for state workers in 
honor of slain civil rights hero martin luther king jr making 
racially insensitive remarks and alienating blacks homosexuals and 
feminists 
he did not begin to fall however until he was accused of 
failing to list 350000 in campaign contributions then he was 
accused of trying to thwart an investigation of a death threat 
against a witness in the campaign fund probe 
he was also accused of lending 80000 in state money to his own 
auto dealership mecham pontiac 
those accusations became the basis of the impeachment charges 
that resulted in his removal from office monday he also faces a 
criminal trial in april 
mecham 63 son of mormon farming parents in utah and a world 
war ii fighter pilot was an extreme conservative and perennial 
political outsider who tried and tried again eventually running 
for governor five times 
he finally took office in 1986 over opposition from the state 
republican establishment the media and many phoenix business 
leaders 
being a dairy farmers son during the depression and early war 
years forged mechams character including those traits responsible 
for both his rise and his fall 
hes never been a quitter said his cousin ona rust in an 
interview in altamont utah earlier this year 
in 1942 18yearold evan took over most duties on his fathers 
farm when his father became incapacitated by arthritis evan was 
forced to cut back on schoolwork but kept up his grades and earned 
a scholarship to utah state university 
he had a reputation as someone who always worked hard said 
another former neighbor harry fieldsted who added i dont know 
if he was any smarter but he seemed to apply himself more 
mecham sang and danced at mormon church functions and was 
elected student body president his junior year at altamont high 
school though he was kidded about his shyness in the 1941 yearbook 
mechams date at the altamont junior prom florence lambert 
became his wife and they ended up having seven children the 
couple settled in arizona after world war ii and mecham started to 
study business at arizona state university 
he put himself through college by selling cars in rural ajo in 
1950 he moved his pontiac dealership to glendale a phoenix 
suburb he published his own newspaper during the 1960s to provide 
an alternative to the phoenix press 
mecham became interested in politics during the 1950s and won 
his only previous term in office as a state senator in 1960 
two years later he lost a us senate race then ran unsuccessfully 
for governor four times including a 1978 loss to democrat bruce 
babbitt by about 41000 votes 
mecham wasnt planning to run for governor in 1986 until 
confidante max hawkins launched a oneman draft he won the office 
with only 40 percent of the vote in a threeway race 
mecham ran into his first controversy the day after the election 
when he announced he would cancel the king holiday on grounds 
babbitt illegally created it by executive order 
by the time mecham was inaugurated on jan 5 1987 ed buck and 
a few other members of the mecham watchdog committee were marching 
in the background and announced plans to recall him from office 
by the time the renamed mecham recall committee kicked off its 
campaign on july 5 mecham had 
made good on his promise to cancel the king holiday 
defended the use of the word pickaninny to describe black 
children in an essay in a book by his mentor utah 
constitutionalist w cleon skousen 
made what some considered a string of substandard nominations 
including a proposed liquor department head who was under 
investigation in a 1955 slaying and a revenue department head who 
had filed his own income taxes late 
claimed that working women cause divorce and that homosexuality 
is an unacceptable lifestyle 
the controversy escalated in late september when mechams 
backers mailed a nationwide fundraising letter urging conservative 
republicans to sell your house pack your belongings and move 
to arizona to help him battle the militant liberals and the 
homosexual lobby 
the letter led to the first public calls for his resignation 
including one from arizona gop patriarch barry goldwater 
then garry trudeaus nationally syndicated comic strip 
doonesbury portrayed him as saying that charges against him 
were lies spread by queers and pickaninnies 
mecham constantly warred with the media claiming reporters felt 
no obligation to tell the truth and accusing the news media of 
spreading the cancerous lie that he was a bigot 
mechams legal problems surfaced in october when it was 
revealed that he had failed to list a 350000 campaign loan in his 
financial reports attorney general bob corbin and house speaker 
joe lane launched investigations as the governor claimed the 
failure was an honest mistake and that the loan was lumped with 
others to save time 
then a few days before the state grand jury was to open its 
probe of the loan a state official told the department of public 
safety that another state official lee watkins had threatened the 
life of grand jury witness and former mecham legislative aide donna 
carlson if she didnt keep her mouth shut about the loan 
when dps director ralph milstead told mecham his office was 
going to cooperate with the attorney generals investigation of the 
alleged threat the governor allegedly ordered him not to do so 
it also was revealed in late fall that mecham had loaned his 
auto dealership 80000 from a protocol fund created from money 
raised by his inaugural committee 
mecham pontiac which bore the sign if you cant deal with 
mecham you just cant deal had to be sold last week due to poor 
sales blamed on an avalanche of negative publicity 
only the 350000 campaign loan was cited when mecham was 
indicted by the state grand jury on jan 8 but the house impeached 
him on all three charges 
mecham still faces an april 21 criminal trial on the 350000 
loan charge the senate dismissed that impeachment article in an 
effort to guarantee him a fair trial and ensure an early 
impeachment vote 
through it all mecham steadfastly refused to resign and insisted 
he would be found innocent in both courts and would be reelected 
in the may recall election 
the governor often quoted abraham lincoln saying he would be 
happy if he eventually were vindicated but if he werent ten 
angels swearing i was right wont make any difference

a judge and a witness were given 
police protection monday after a vengeful cop killer described as 
educated and coldblooded broke out of a maximum security 
prison along with two other murderers 
bobby stacy 35 and two other inmates serving life sentences 
without chance of parole escaped from the west virginia 
penitentiary here on sunday 
my fear is that some police officer is going to get killed 
because thats this guys method he has nothing to lose plus its 
his history said charles hatcher the assistant cabell county 
prosecutor whom stacy had threatened 
stacy formerly of columbus ohio was convicted in the 1981 
murder of a huntington police officer at the time of the slaying 
he was free on bail on charges that he shot an ohio patrolman 
police immediately assigned protection to some of those who 
helped convict stacy stacy repeatedly threatened to kill the judge 
and the prosecutor at the 1982 trial according to huntington 
police lt joe walker 
he is educated and cold blooded thats the worst combination 
there is hatcher said in huntington 160 miles south of the 
prison he said he had no plans to ask for protection for himself 
stacy was a successful businessman who used the money from his 
crimes for business ventures when he was arrested he owned a bar 
at least two houses and several automobiles 
roadblocks were set up on routes leading into ohio and 
pennsylvania which borders marshall county where the prison is 
to the east 
state police in west virginia ohio and pennsylvania as well as 
sheriffs deputies combed the countryside said wardens secretary 
jerrie clutter 
circuit judge alfred e ferguson who asked that an extra 
sheriffs bailiff be assigned to him said he was concerned about 
his safety ill be more worried if he is out for awhile 
ferguson said in huntington 
also under protection was an unidentified columbus ohio woman 
and former friend of stacys who had testified against him said 
columbus police officer clarence ward 
if anyone has to fear she does hatcher said her car was 
torched and she received death threats during the trial he said 
hatcher said he was offered police protection but turned it down 
lets face it if somebody wants to kill you theyre not 
going to announce it and swing into town he said theyre 
going to do it at a red light or through your kitchen window 
huntington police officers who usually patrol alone worked in 
pairs monday 
a suspect is less likely to shoot that way said lt toby 
shy 
stacy david williams 28 and tommie mollohan 45 were 
discovered missing during a routine check sunday night officials 
said 
warden jerry hedrick said monday the inmates all maintenance 
workers knocked a hole in a wall of an elevator shaft in the 
infirmary to gain entrance to a shed where bolt cutters were kept 
then they climbed through another elevator shaft this one in an 
unused building to the second floor where they used pipe and a 
cord to lower themselves to the ground he said 
the escapees hid behind ventilation equipment then used the 
bolt cutters to cut through a lock on a gate and flee he said 
hedrick said evidence indicated the escapees had outside help 
he said bloodhounds tracked their scent across the street to a 
museum parking lot where the trail disappeared 
it obviously was wellplanned therefore we have got to assume 
plans were also made for the outside once they got out said 
corrections commissioner av dodrill 
mollohan was convicted of robbing and then killing a brounland 
grocer in 1973 mollohan at the time was an escapee from a florida 
prison 
williams was convicted of murder arson and robbery in the 1980 
slaying of a marytown resident found bludgeoned in his burned home

a federal appeals court refused monday to 
reverse the espionage and theft convictions of a former us 
intelligence analyst who gave secret satellite photographs of a 
soviet ship to a british magazine 
a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
unanimously rejected samuel loring morisons arguments that 
congress intended laws against spying to protect against the 
distribution of classified material to a foreign government rather 
than leaks to the press 
several news organizations including the new york times the 
washington post the wall street journal and three television 
networks filed briefs in the appeal which focused on first 
amendment guarantees of free speech and freedom of the press 
morison grandson of the late pulitzer prizewinning naval 
historian samuel eliot morison was convicted in october 1985 of 
giving to janes defence weekly photographs taken by a us spy 
satellite of a soviet nuclear aircraft carrier under construction 
morison who worked as a civilian for the navy also was 
convicted of the theft of the photos and government documents 
describing a may 1984 explosion at the soviet unions severomorsk 
naval base 
he was sentenced to two years in prison but has been free under 
100000 bond pending the appeal 
prosecutors said morisons actions endangered national security 
because the photos revealed how a us spy satellite worked they 
also said he leaked the photos to get a fulltime job with janes 
after doing parttime work for the military journal while employed 
by the navy 
the american civil liberties union denounced the appeals court 
decision 
the decision poses a grave threat to the first amendment 
said kate martin speaking for the civil liberties group in 
washington dc it will signficantly cut off public debate on 
issues of national security if the decision stands it may 
criminalize much of what is printed daily in newspapers on national 
security matters 
defense attorneys contended morison was trying to educate the 
public about a soviet naval buildup and that the photos told the 
soviets nothing they had not learned already from a 1978 incident 
in which the spy satellites operations manual was sold to a soviet 
agent 
the defense also said the espionage prosecution violated 
morisons right to free speech and would intimidate lowlevel 
government employees from leaking information which would embarrass 
their superiors 
the mere fact that one has stolen a document in order that he 
may deliver it to the press whether for money or other personal 
gain will not immunize him from responsibility for his criminal 
act said judge donald russell in the main ruling 
to use the first amendment for such a purpose would be to 
convert the first amendment into a warrant for thievery 
in a concurring opinion judge j harvie wilkinson iii said the 
constitutional interests were significant but added that the 
manner in which the photographs were released threatened another 
important public interest the security of sensitive government 
operations 
judge j dickson phillips jr in his concurring opinion agreed 
that broadly drawn federal espionage laws are unwieldy and 
imprecise instruments for prosecuting government leakers to the 
press as opposed to government moles in the service of other 
countries 
yet in morisons case he said a jury instruction requiring 
proof that the leaked information was either potentially damaging 
to the government or might be useful to an enemy was a sufficient 
limit 
mark lynch morisons lawyer had not seen the appeals ruling 
monday he said he had not decided whether to seek a rehearing 
before the 4th circuit or ask for a us supreme court review of 
the case

democrat jesse jackson made final appeals 
to wisconsin democrats monday on the eve of the states 
presidential primary saying ive stood with you and now i want 
you the people to stand with me 
jackson campaigned before college students held rallies in 
predominantly black and hispanic neighborhoods of milwaukee and 
addressed 4000 people on the stops of the state capitol in madison 
thousands filled milwaukees mecca auditorium for an evening 
rally in madison a huge crowd filled the capitol steps rising 
high on a hill and spilled over to sidewalks across the street as 
jackson delivered an emotional appeal for support under the setting 
sun 
youre looking for a leader to vote for in wisconsin he 
said 
earlier jackson campaigned among college students on the 20th 
anniversary of martin luther king jrs death repeatedly invoking 
the memory of the slain civil rights leader 
twenty years later weve kept struggling he said 
nothing will break our spirit reagan says cut back we say fight 
back 
jackson said his goal like kings was pulling people 
together across ancient barriers to common ground 
urging the students to reject yuppieism jackson told them 
that by voting you have the power to end reaganomics 
jackson walked through a hispanic community of milwaukee where 
he drew only a small crowd and later spoke to hundreds of students 
at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee campus 
he also spoke to a largely black street rally and headed to 
later rallies in janesville and at the state capitol in madison 
jackson was counting on broad support beyond wisconsins small 
minority population he if is to win the primary where 81 
delegates are at stake 
a recent milwaukee journal poll put him 8 percentage points 
behind michael dukakis but the race was still regarded as close 
as he campaigned jackson was embroiled in controversy over his 
appeal to panama strongman gen manuel antonio noriega to leave 
office and a message he sent two weeks ago saying i am anxious 
to do whatever i can to help alleviate the suffering 
jackson released a translated letter of response from noriega 
saying he was not leaving and offering to speak with you more 
deeply whenever you are available 
jackson said he had no plans to visit noriega he repeated his 
call for noriega to leave asked for a congressional investigation 
into us dealings with the accused drug smuggler and called for 
international relief agencies to provide humanitarian aid to 
the people of panama 
at the state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
signalled displeasure over jacksons communications with noriega 
in our view proliferation of channels is a tactic that noriega 
likes to use to buy time ms oakley said we have available 
channels of communication with noriega if and when they are needed 
we think it would be best to continue to use these channels 
exclusively 
jackson however said he was not attempting to interfere 
its nothing but a very strong and public appeal he said 
the appeal has been very public i would hope the whole 
world would make a public appeal 
jackson said he did not favor an end to the economic sanctions 
applied to pressure noriega to leave office but he said they have 
caused some people to lack food and medicine and have not achieved 
their goal 
the quick solution of economic sanctions clearly did not 
work jackson said now we are in danger of alienating 
the people of panama he also attacked what he called a policy of 
hysteria and military adventurism by the reagan administration in 
the region 
jackson said he talked by telephone monday afternoon with two 
highranking state department officials and said they offered no 
disagreement with his appeal for noriega to leave 
speaking with reporters on his campaign bus in janesville wis 
jackson said john c whitehead the deputy secretary of state and 
michael h armacost undersecretary of state for political affairs 
told him the reagan administration already has begun providing a 
small amount of humanitarian aid because of hardships in panama 
caused by the economic sanctions he said it amounted to 275000 
but that is too little as compared to the serverity of the 
crunch on the people jackson told reporters 
jackson said he called the state department during a stop for a 
campaign rally in janesville he said whitehead saw abosultely 
nothing inconsistent with our very public and moral appeal to get 
noriega to leave 
he said the officials made no suggestion that he should tone 
down his efforts or be more cautious with dealing with noriega 
on another matter jackson aides distributed what they said was 
an apology jackson received from jeanne simon wife of rival paul 
simon it was in reaction to her saying of jackson all he can do 
is talk adolf hitler made some good speeches too 
in her statement to jackson she called him a powerful orator 
experience is also important in a president and thats the point 
i was addressing i used the most extreme example i could have to 
make that point and i should not have i appologize to jesse if 
there was any misunderstanding she said 
meanwhile the jackson campaign once strapped for funds 
collected 22 million last month that provides him with some 
ready cash for use in big contests like the april 19 new york 
primary

prosecutors may use evidence seized at 
the home of a man accused in 16 slayings at his trial for the 
shooting deaths of two of the victims a judge ruled monday 
r gene simmons 47 is charged with murdering two former 
coworkers during a 45minute period last dec 28 jim chaffin 33 
and kathy kendrick 24 were slain during a spree that prosecutors 
contend was motivated by a desire for revenge 
simmons trial is scheduled to begin may 9 at ozark after being 
moved from pope county where the deaths occurred 
simmons a retired air force master sergeant also is charged 
with two counts of capital murder for the deaths of 14 relatives 
whose bodies were found on his property near dover after the 
russellville slayings prosecutors allege that simmons shot or 
suffocated the 14 during the christmas holidays no trial date has 
been set for those charges 
prosecutors brought more than 40 pieces of evidence to the 
courtroom monday including pistols that were used in the 
russellville killings 
attorneys for simmons argued that the search of simmons home 
prior to the issuance of a search warrant was an unconstitutional 
violation of his fourth amendment right to be free from 
unreasonable searches the lawyers asked pope county circuit judge 
john patterson to suppress the evidence found on simmons property 
the judge did not rule on suppressing evidence in the deaths of 
simmons relatives one capital murder charge in that case arises 
from the discovery of five bodies in simmons home and the second 
stems from the discovery of nine others in a shallow grave near the 
house and in the trunks of two abandoned cars on the property 
defense attorneys contend the states ability to collect 
evidence in the case would not have been hindered had authorities 
postponed the search until a search warrant was issued

supporters of impeached gov evan mecham sank lower and lower 
monday 
aye aye aye a few mecham opponents cheered but most outside 
the arizona senate building booed and a few shed tears as the votes 
continued 
the carnivallike party which included a trumpet quartet and a 
country n western duo throughout the day was over 
i feel betrayed by our legislature i had more faith in 
them said mecham supporter millie pratt i really felt he 
would win it should have been close i dont know what happened 
the crowd which had dwindled to 200 or so by the time of the 
roll call votes huddled around portable televisions and radios to 
listen as the state senate decided to remove mecham from office 
the loudest cheer of the afternoon came when the senate declined 
to invoke the dracula clause a measure that would have barred 
mecham from holding future offices 
its not over its only beginning were not going to quit 
said supporter virginia archer who predicted mecham will be able 
to run in and win a recall election set for may 17 
its no surprise said mecham supporter andy cosentino 
its a kangaroo court 
a few antimecham believers cheered the aye votes for 
conviction on the impeachment charges im very happy and 
relieved i think hes a menace and i think hes clearly guilty of 
malfeasance said barry gabriel who carried a sign saying simply 
guilty guilty guilty 
mecham waved the crowd and smiled as he left and the gathering 
sang god bless america 
earlier some 300 supporters staged an 11th hour protest and 
mock funeral for the arizona constitution complete with trumpters 
playing taps and pallbearers toting a black wooden coffin 
it turned out to be a burial for mechams administration 
its a sad story these people antimecham senators made up 
their minds months ago we all know it but we have come out to 
show support and hope somebody changes their mind at the last 
minute said theo putnam 
lula crosby a retired junior high school teacher held an 
american flag high for two hours 
the flag stands for justice purity and honesty all the good 
things she said we hope that they senators are on the right 
track and they give us justice and not take our vote away from us 
some wore railroad attire and blew a trainlike whistle and 
paper train tracks were laid across the plaza because mecham 
supporters said the embattled chief executive was being railroaded 
by the legislature 
they chanted we love you governor as mecham arrived 
looking subdued and giving only a brief thumbsup sign as he 
entered the senate a thank heaven for evan sign was taped to 
the building 
the demonstration was punctuated by a trumpted quartet imported 
by supporters from los angeles that opened with america from 
west side story a woman passing out mechams book come back 
america danced to the refrains 
cindy biggs woke up her three children ages 4 2 and 9 months

support him she said 
sharon crandall donned maidlike attire and carried a broom and 
a sign saying its time for a good house cleaning in our 
capitol 
i think they know gov mecham is innocent if they can 
withstand the pressure of the power establishment in arizona

a sevencar funeral procession circled the capitol led by a 
white station wagon carrying the coffin on top of the black casket

gov evan mecham sat solemnly showing 
virtually no emotion as the senate convicted him of two 
impeachment counts monday and removed him from office 
i think he gave me the impression that he was almost resigned 
to the fact that he knew it was coming said defense attorney 
jerris leonard who sat next to the firstterm republican at the 
defense table 
the governor said little to his attorneys as senators announced 
their votes some so softly that they could not be heard from the 
gallery said leonard 
the governor listened as senators denounced him as a liar and 
accused him of misusing the power he gained when he took office in 
january 1987 
but minutes later mecham smiled broadly as he met reporters in 
a senate hallway and left the building to loud cheers from 
supporters 
well they senators dont like my politics so we finished a 
political trial its as simple as that he said he was not 
required to attend the senate vote and leonard said earlier monday 
he had advised mecham not to 
the governors political opponents werent celebrating as they 
voted to make mecham the first us governor impeached and removed 
from office in neaerly six decades 
theres no joy in anyones hearts today said assistant 
minority leader lela alston a democrat who voted to convict on 
both counts im heartsick 
i think its a sad day for everyone when we have to vote to 
impeach our governor said democratic sen peter rios who also 
voted to convict mecham of obstructing justice and misusing money 
from the governors protocol fund 
sen peter kay a republican said its a relief so that we 
can get back to our business 
even those who voted in mechams favor did not say positive 
things about the governor instead maintaining he did nothing to 
warrant removal 
sen jan brewer a republican who voted in mechams favor said 
the governors actions were grossly inadequate even seriously 
incompetent but i dont find it purposely obstruction of 
justice 
ladies and gentlemen governor mecham has struck out 
announced democrat jesus chuy higuera who voted against the 
governor on both counts the citizens of this state will not 
tolerate this evil insensitivity to the arizona constitution he 
said 
republican sen tony west addressed his comments to mecham 
directly saying its obvious now that you will no longer be 
the governor of the state of arizona 
many people across this state believe in you and believe in 
you passionately and i think you abrogated the trust of people 
who have so passionately believed in you west said 
west said mechams ability to tell the truth was in a state of 
bankruptcy and read from a book that psychoanalyzed people who 
habitually lie

chamber asked what he intended to do next mecham said well 
decide tomorrow 
he left the building with a smile and a wave to scores of 
supporters cheering and singing god bless america 
the vote ended a yearandahalf of controversy that shook 
staunchly republican arizona and brought ridicule and criticism 
from politicians comedians and the comic strip doonesbury 
mecham a former auto dealer who was elected in 1986 on his 
fifth try in a threeway race with 40 percent of the vote had 
offended blacks jews women and homosexuals with offhand remarks 
and official actions 
a motion to bar him from ever holding state office in arizona 
fell three votes short of a twothirds majority with 17 in favor 
and 13 opposed 
the last governor to be impeached and removed from office was 
henry johnston of oklahoma who was removed in 1929

difficult times in arizona and urged residents to purge our 
hearts of suspicion and hate 
today none of us are republicans none of us are democrats

arizonans

democrats voted to convict nine republicans voted to acquit 
on the second count 15 republicans and 11 democrats voted yes 
four republicans voted no on whether to bar mecham from future 
office nine republicans and eight democrats voted for exclusion 
10 republicans and three democrats voted against 
the citizens of this state will not tolerate this evil 
insensitivity said democratic sen jesus chuy higuera in 
voting to convict 
republican sen jan brewer said she felt mecham made a serious 
error but she added i do not think it is sufficient to remove 
him from office 
the vote is 21 ayes nine nos evan mecham is convicted of 
high crimes misdemeanors and malfeasance in office said the 
trials presiding officer arizona chief justice frank x gordon 
jr after the vote on the first count 
theres no joy in anyones hearts today said assistant 
minority leader lela alston a democrat who voted to convict on 
both counts im heartsick 
the combative mecham drew fire for rescinding a martin luther 
king jr holiday a move that prompted of boycott of arizona by 
organizations looking to hold conventions in arizona and defending 
the use of the word pickaninny for black children he also came 
under attack for appointments deemed unqualified including a tax 
official who didnt file his taxes 
the house voted 4614 to impeach mecham feb 5 on the two counts 
on which he was convicted and a charge of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan the senate dismissed the third charge during the 
sixweek trial 
mecham also faced a recall election may 17 and is scheduled for 
trial in court april 21 on felony charges of concealing the 
350000 loan the question of whether he may run in the recall 
election is likely to be decided in court said attorney general 
bob corbin 
corbin said earlier that the recall election would be held as 
scheduled whether mecham was in office or not and that the 
governor in office at the time mrs mofford would have to run 
in the election to remain in office 
because the senate didnt bar mecham from holding office in the 
future supporters held out hope for a victory in the recall 
election its not over its only beginning were not going to 
quit now said virginia archer of phoenix 
the senate after voting adjourned for the day and said it 
would reconvene wednesday to hear any motions from attorneys 
in atlanta news of mechams removal brought cheers from 
hundreds at a banquet held in memory of king by the southern 
christian leadership conference mechams removal came exactly 20 
years after the civil rights leaders assassination 
i cant rejoice at anyones misfortune i think justice has 
been served i hate to rejoice but somehow i feel good about 
this impeachment said sclc president joseph lowery 
some lawmakers were given police protection monday night after 
receiving threatening phone calls prompted by the vote said allan 
schmidt spokesman for the state department of public safety 
theyve been all types of intimidatingtype threatening 
statements ranging from voter response to the ultimate schmidt 
said 
the voting by the senate began after the prosecutor paul 
eckstein beseeched the lawmakers to convict and remove mecham and 
bring down the curtain on this prolonged embarrassing and bitter 
tragedy 
on the obstruction charge mecham was accused of telling ralph 
milstead the states top police official not to cooperate with 
the state attorney generals probe of an alleged threat against a 
former aide who was about to testify before a grand jury 
investigating mechams finances 
the threat allegedly was made by lee watkins a mecham campaign 
fundraiser and state official watkins an exconvict was said to 
have warned that donna carlson would go on a long boat ride if 
she didnt keep quiet he denied any wrongdoing 
mecham testified he did not consider the alleged threat a 
serious matter 
the governor was also accused of misusing 80000 from a fund 
consisting of contributions raised from mechams inaugural 
the prosecution charged that the funds were public money for use 
in promoting arizona and that mecham took out the loan because his 
dealership was in financial trouble mecham claimed that the money 
was private and that he borrowed it only to give the state higher 
interest than it was receiving 
i urge you to consider that by allowing mecham to return to 
office to wreak havoc once again upon this state you will have 
redefined in the most shameful way what is acceptable conduct for a 
public official eckstein argued monday 
let the people decide said defense attorney jerris leonard 
urging senators to acquit the governor and let him defend his 
office in the recall election 
i ask you wheres the beef another defense attorney fred 
craft said of the evidence you are being asked to politically 
assassinate governor mecham by those who would politically gain 
from his demise

a congressional commission formed to study 
medicare payments to physicians recommended today that a national

by different types of doctors 
the physician payment review commissions recommendation is 
controversial because it almost certainly will pit medical 
speciality against medical speciality in assigning a relative value 
to each doctors work 
how for example would such a scale compare the value of one 
hour of brain surgery with a like time spent by a heart surgeon or

in this nation of 1 billion people who are 
multiplying faster than the government wants dr zhang lizhu is 
working to help infertile couples have the one baby chinese law 
allows 
the beijing medical university researcher recently saw the 
success of three years of work when a 39yearold primary school 
teacher bore chinas first testtube baby a girl 
the birth nearly 10 years after the worlds first testtube 
baby louise joy brown was born in england was celebrated as a 
national achievement proof that china can master advanced medical 
procedures 
it also was a sign of the governments relatively recent support 
for programs to help the infertile overcoming opponents who argue 
that the last thing china needs is more babies 
large families once were a tradition in china and boys were 
favored because they could help support the family later on but 
with the population burgeoning the government instituted rigorous 
birth control measures in the late 1970s and each couple was 
restricted to one child the governments goal is to achieve zero 
population growth by the year 2000 
the penalties for couples who have more than one child can a 
fine and the loss of valued government or work benefits 
but there was rejoicing when zheng mengzhu the 8pound 
testtube girl was born march 10 for it meant a breakthrough for 
those couples unable to have the one child permitted by law 
mengzhus picture and her mothers were published on the front 
pages of leading newspapers and china central television broadcast 
an operatingroom interview with the mother after the delivery by 
caesarean section 
if shes clever enough and studies hard i want her to become a 
doctor or lawyer said the mother zheng guizhen who spent her 
entire nine months of pregnancy in the hospital to ensure nothing 
went wrong 
everything was smooth said mrs zhang the doctor she 
had some morning sickness but no high blood pressure 
but mrs zhang is taking no chances with this baby a small 
symbol of chinas progress in medicine she isnt letting the 
mother and child make the arduous fourday trip to the familys 
home in rural northwest china until the weather is warmer and the 
baby is several months old 
meanwhile mrs zhang is closely watching the progress of a 
woman pregnant with chinas second testtube child due in may 
she also has conducted two gamete fallopian transfers an 
alternate method of artificial fertilization in which the doctor 
places the mothers eggs and fathers sperm together in the womans 
fallopian tubes instead of in a laboratory dish 
mrs zhangs first attempt ended in a miscarriage but the 
second resulted in the birth of zheng mengzhu 
mrs zhang aided by eight other doctors began her testtube 
baby program in 1984 at the beijing medical universitys no 3 
teaching hospital in 1986 the government made producing a 
testtube baby one of the goals of chinas fiveyear plan and 
appointed mrs zhang to head the effort 
the government allocated the yuan equivalent of only 108000 
for the task a sum mrs zhang said showed spiritual support 
but fell far short of the need 
to observe the procedure in action she and two assistants 
visited doctors in the united states who did pioneering work in the 
field 
but her own relatively primitive laboratory facilities she 
said could not match those of the american doctors in winter she 
had trouble just keeping the lab warm enough for the delicate egg 
and sperm cultures many chinese public buildings have little or no 
heat 
mrs zhang said she implanted artifically fertilized eggs in the 
wombs of 14 patients without success before the two pregnancies 
resulted 
i feel just a bit relieved that i fulfilled what i said i 
would mrs zhang said after mengzhus birth actually its 
nothing very outstanding its almost the 6000th testtube baby 
worldwide but in china i think its very hard to do this work due 
to our facilities and public opinion 
many believe china has no need for artificial fertilization when 
the natural birth rate threatens to outpace the food supply 
one of the reasons we started this program quite late is that 
we knew there would be different opinions mrs zhang said 
everybody knows china is overpopulated 
but the law permits all couples to have one child she added 
even the infertile she said hundreds of women have written or 
visited to seek her help some in tears because of family pressure 
to produce a child especially a son 
probably the woman will be mistreated by her motherinlaw 
because she cant give birth mrs zhang said some even think 
of suicide 
mrs zheng chinas first testtube mother said as she 
breastfed her baby most people cant understand how a woman 
suffers when she hasnt had a baby 
for 20 years i expected i would have a child but couldnt if 
dr zhang had not given me a child i would not have wanted to keep 
living 
china does not keep statistics on the number of infertile 
couples mrs zhang estimated that about 50000 women might be 
candidates for testtube fertilization but emphasized that no 
studies have been done 
traditionally women who could not become pregnant made 
offerings to the earth god and ate herbs believed to increase 
fertility mrs zhang said some herbs appear to help in individual 
cases although the reason has not been researched 
since 1981 sperm banks have opened in several major cities 
including beijing canton shanghai and chungking they have 
claimed dozens of pregnancies 
at least four hospitals or research institutes in addition to 
the beijing medical university have begun testtube baby programs 
although none has yet produced a pregnancy

chinas first male sexual disorders clinic 
treats sterile and impotent men with a secret method used in old 
imperial courts across town barren women get the secret 
shuangshuang doubledouble treatment based on other old 
remedies 
doctors at these clinics in harbin the capital of the 
northeastern province of heilongjiang say they have been markedly 
successful with their unique combination of western and chinese 
traditional medicine 
at the center for treatment and consultation of sexual disorders 
of men doctors refer cryptically to the imperial cure by the code 
name 8311 and will only say that it involves herbs minerals 
and animal parts used in chinese traditional medicine 
at the center for treatment and consultation of sexual disorders 
of women barren women undergo daily doubledouble treatments 
which involve injections of a liquid medication into the genitals 
and rectum 
but once again the doctors will not divulge detailed 
information saying only that it is a concoction of herbs used in 
traditional chinese medicine 
it is a secret said dr shi ling director of the 
obstetrical and gynecological hospital of harbin we have not 
published it yet 
however the doctors are happy to talk about their successes 
sixty to 70 percent of the 125 sterile or impotent patients who 
have been treated with 8311 were cured said dr ma ran deputy 
director of the no 4 hospital of harbin 
at least 11 of 33 women given the doubledouble treatment have 
become pregnant shi said however the clinic has not been to 
follow up on all its patients and shi suspects the pregnancy 
figures might be higher 
even more impressive though is the claim by dr zhao tieyan of 
the traditional chinese medicine hospital in shenyang in 
neighboring liaoning province 
according to the englishlanguage newspaper china daily zhao 
has treated 90000 men for sterility and 75 percent of them later 
fathered children 
the report did not give any details about her treatment or the 
composition of the medication she developed from her study of 
chinese traditional medicine 
the doubledouble treatment was developed by guo hengsheng a 
doctor of western medicine who had also studied chinese traditional 
medicine 
its name derives from the two injections and the heating of the 
womans abdomen and back 
the treatment is supposed to reduce infection and inflammation 
in the pelvic area that may be blocking pregnancy 
following the injections the women undergo several hours of 
heat treatment huddling under layers of heavy quilts and on top of 
electric blankets 
the women undergo treatments every day for a week then have a 
week off the treatment period can be as short as one week or as 
long as several months 
we know it works when they get pregnant shi said

ko sukje lined up 50 pairs of roller 
skates in neat rows as a spring breeze whipped across the square 
and hundreds of people whirled around on bikes and skates 
spring is the best season everyone comes out ko said with 
a smile as he tugged on his red baseball cap 
another bitterly cold korean winter has come and gone a pale 
spring sun drew out crowds from thousands of small apartments where 
they had been cooped up for five months 
purple and yellow blooms were just starting to unfold on trees 
and bushes on the edges of yoido square 
the milelong tarmac square is one of the few open spaces in the 
bustling city of 10 million and people flock to it once warm 
weather arrives 
the city main site of the 1988 summer olympics has few public 
parks or other open areas and many people live in drab concrete 
apartment buildings that stretch for miles around the city 
theres no space in seoul said ko the skate renter this 
is the only place in the city where theres space 
on this balmy day students children and whole families had 
come to yoido to rent bikes or roller skates and just ride round 
and round 
we feel free said kim miji a college student who was 
skipping afternoon classes to go bike riding with her friends we 
enjoy ourselves a lot 
thousands of bikes and skates were lined up on one side of the 
square waiting to be rented for about a dollar rows of shoes were 
piled by the skates as their owners whirled across the square or 
struggled to keep their balance 
children whooped and laughed as they darted around on red bikes 
decorated with picutres of rambo brandishing a grenade launcher 
theres nowhere to ride bikes at home so we cant have them 
said one boy 
everywhere across the city of giant office buildings and clogged 
streets people were enjoying their first breath of spring they 
strolled the sidewalks or stood on street corners watching the 
world go by and chatting with friends 
sidewalk vendors offered chestnuts hot potatos and dried squid 
women with stoves on carts fried onion pancakes and stirred pots 
simmering with noodles in red pepper sauce 
flowers flowers shouted other vendors offering the first 
red blue and yellow blooms from the warmer south pedestrians 
stopped to inspect the bouquets and some brought a bunch to take 
home 
a few vendors sold imported bananas for the equivalent of 125 
each imported fruit is classified as a luxury and heavily taxed 
hundreds of old men stood around in large groups or strolled at 
pagoda park one of the few parks in central seoul some played a 
board game called jangi and bets were changing hands 
most of the retirees were dressed in western suits but a few 
wore traditional korean fur hats snug silk jacks and long loose 
linen pantaloons 
sidewalk fortune tellers did a brisk business as people came to 
ask if the spring would bring luck or if romance was in the offing 
many people come to know their fortunes for the year said 
an old fortune teller sitting on a blanket surrounded by 
astrological charts in chinese and korean 
asked for his name he laughed 
im 70 years old he said waving a visitor away

political debates are back on chilean 
television for the first time since the rightwing military seized 
power 14 years ago 
but government critics including those who appearing on the 
screen contend that television access remains minimal and that 
more airtime is needed to create an informed public for the 
singlecandidate presidential balloting planned for later this year 
chile has no commercial television one national network is run 
by the government all other channels are operated by universities 
that have been under government control since the military took 
over in a 1973 coup 
political debates a popular feature on television before the 
coup were prohibited by the military rulers and general political 
information was limited to the broadcast of government views 
but that changed in january when the national universitys 
channel 11 in santiago began broadcasting a sunday night program 
called currents of opinion a twohour prerecorded political 
debate participants came from both the government and the 
opposition 
in march channel 13 of the catholic university introduced 
face the nation a live monday night program in which three 
journalists question representatives of a particular political 
party 
but the state television the only one that broadcasts 
nationally has not yet followed suit 
the return of political debates has coincided with a limited 
increase in the coverage of opposition political parties on 
television newscasts 
members of the opposition and some media experts acknowledging 
that they see some progress toward more balanced political 
presentations on television say its still not enough 
i think what television is doing is still absolutely 
insufficient to give chileans ample and pluralist information in 
the face of the upcoming election campaign said jaime moreno 
president of chiles journalists association 
the new debates indicate some progress moreno said in an 
interview but he added that the opposition still faces 
discrimination in news programs 
chileans will vote later this year no date has been set for 
or against a single militarypicked candidate who if approved in 
the referendumstyle balloting will serve as president from 1989 
to 1997 
president augusto pinochet the 72yearold army commander who 
led the 1973 coup appears to be aggressively seeking the 
nomination and is considered the most probable candidate 
chiles roman catholic church and some foreign governments 
including the united states have said equal access to television 
is needed to ensure a fair election campaign and ensure the new 
governments legitimacy 
enrique krauss a christian democrat who has represented his 
party in several debates said tv access remains too limited 
debates are not enough krauss said the general news 
coverage today continues to be dominated by a nondemocratic line 
hourlong nightly news programs commonly dedicate a half hour or 
more to activities or comments by pinochet and other officials as 
well as public works projects and other progovernment information 
figures compiled by a santiagobased private social research 
institute indicated that during a fiveday period in late january 
santiagos tv channels devoted 75 minutes to government views on 
political issues and the opposition got 7 minutes 54 seconds 
during the first week of march coverage allocated to the 
government was 88 minutes with 2 minutes 13 seconds for the 
opposition 
a similar report by the christian democratic party concluded 
that 98 percent of televisions political coverage in 1987 was 
devoted to progovernment news 
rene abeliuk a social democrat who has also participated in 
several debates said televisions new approach to political 
coverage is just a beginning that should be followed by a more 
balanced coverage of the opposition views in the newscasts 
participants in the debates say they have generally been allowed 
to state their views without restrictions some of the topics of 
the debates have been highly sensitive for the government such as 
alleged human rights violations 
television officials say they are working without government 
interference 
we are inviting anybody we want to participate in the debate 
and we intend to continue to do so said roberto pulido one of 
the inteviewers on face the nation 
tv officials acknowledge that the political opening on 
television is still limited juan agustin vargas an executive of 
the catholic university television station explained our 
channel has done whatever it has been able to during these years 
and weve gradully been giving more political information 
although tv political debates were popular before the military 
coup the new ones have not attracted the massive audiences some 
expected 
currents of opinion rose from a rating of 56 in the first 
few weeks to around 11 march 27 the same day another station got 
399 points by showing the north and the south the us 
miniseries set during the american civil war

when gregoire dhomanse steps out the 
door of his birthplace he enters a world where no one speaks his 
language 
dhomanse a retired mason lives in blokauss once a village on 
a sleepy lagoon whose inhabitants spoke a language called ebrie 
now their village is a neighborhood in abidjan surrounded by 
modern skyscrapers super highways shops and apartment buildings 
gone are their fields of yams cocoa and coffee 
and like many other africans the people of blokauss must speak 
french to be understood outside their neighborhood 
the ivory coast has about 60000 ebrie speakers in blokauss and 
other villages along the coast their distinctive language and 
culture are threatened by modern development population growth and 
the increasing reliance on french 
the development cant be stopped said koutouan cassien a 
retired primary school director living in blokauss our future 
is the future of ivory coast 
the more dominant african languages are succeeding in taking 
over the functions of european languages said joseph opala an 
american linguist and anthroplogist at the university of sierra 
leone but he added as major african languages gain in 
importance many local african languages on the periphery will 
undoubtedly become extinct 
some african languages such as hausa a widely spoken 
commercial language in niger and northern nigeria have adapted 
well to european culture said malam moussa director of adult 
literacy education in niger he added that hausa has become a 
richer language because of the adaptation 
many reasons are given for the demise of africas smaller 
languages but the influence of european culture and the growth of 
dominant african languages play a part 
in countries like the ivory coast french became the principle 
means of communications because none of its 50 tribal languages 
became dominant in kenya the emergence of swahili kept english 
from becoming the lingua franca 
ivory coasts rapid economic development also accelerated the 
dominance of french the country also has a well developed 
educational system which has stressed french and pushed national 
languages into the background 
africans are nervous that if their languages disappear part 
of them will disappear as well said kuadio jeremie director of 
institute of applied linguistics at the university of abidjan we 
are in a position where we havent fully adapted to european 
culture nor completely abandoned our own culture 
what has emerged in africa is a system called diglossia 
where european and african languages serve different functions in 
society said opala 
european languages he added were used on a formal level for 
government and commerce african languages were spoken informally 
as street and traditional market languages 
words that represent new things are borrowed and adapted to 
the language said moussa a hausa speaker its natural 
when automobiles arrived in hausaland they were given the name 
mota which is similar to the english motor in zimbabwe shona 
speakers use motocari an adaptation of motor car the british 
term for automobile 
some nations both former french and english colonies have 
rejected demands that one tribal language be made their official 
language on grounds it would risk polarizing different ethnic 
groups 
its a question of political will said professor niangoran 
bouah an anthropologist at the university of abidjan besides 
french has all the advantages the other languages dont it is an 
official language a technical language a work language and the 
international diplomatic language 
niger has shown that even in former french colonies local 
languages can flourish in 1973 it implemented an experimental 
primary education system aimed at making students literate in their 
own language there are now 30 such schools providing an 
alternative to the regular primary schools where only french is 
used 
bouah said he believes ivory coast should introduce local 
language instruction into the national educational system but it 
may be too late 
we are well engaged in the development of french and i wonder 
if we will ever be able to return to maternal languages he said 
local languages remain strong in former british colonies because 
they were left alone said george kahari a zimbabwean linguist and 
african literature scholar at the university of zimbabwe 
he noted that zimbabwe formerly british rhodesia has a strong 
tradition of african literature published in local languages 
especially in shona the principle national language 
on the other hand the french insisted they were bringing a 
cultured civilized language to africa and actively promoted its 
domination over local languages he said

editors note huntingtons disease is a strange and 
devastating affliction that has all but wrecked one small town in 
venezuela its lethal inherited course through one large family 
there however may help scientists find a treatment and a cure 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
yelitza margarita cabrera like many 
budding 12yearolds has a crush on at least six boys her age 
chuchito jose luis another chuchito she rattles them off on 
her rough hands chipped pink polish on her short nails a yellow 
plastic butterfly clip gathers up her brown hair in a coquettish 
tilt 
yelitza may have inherited from her father a terminal disease 
that could leave her bedridden unable to speak clearly or chew and 
swallow easily by the time shes 50 
by then she may have had lots of children her grandparents 
eduardo and carmen soto had 14 and passed the disease on to many 
of them 
eduardo and carmen both have huntingtons disease formally 
known as huntingtons chorea which they know as saint vitus 
dance it has been passed on through their familys genes for more 
than six traceable generations 
their familys tragedy has however provided the basis for the 
first concerted effort to find the cause of the disease and perhaps 
learn to treat it or eradicate it 
it was just this year that dr anne young head of the neurology 
department at the university of michigan diagnosed yelitzas 
father as having huntingtons disease an inherited degenerative 
disorder which affects seven to 10 out of every 100000 people in 
the world 
american folk singer woody guthrie was a victim and his son 
arlo guthrie and arlos four children are at risk young is very 
suspicious about yelitza 
her eye movements are a littlebitoff she says with 
matteroffact intensity shes notquiteright 
young belongs to a huntingtons disease research team that has 
been coming to laguneta each march since 1981 to collect blood and 
give neurological and psychological tests to its inhabitants the 
group is headed by dr nancy wexler of columbia universitys 
neurology department 
wexler is also a founder and president of the californiabased 
hereditary disease foundation which coordinates huntingtons 
research in five us universities and one in london 
the foundation has a fiveyear grant of just under 1 million 
from the national institutes of health for huntingtons research 
laguneta and two other poor venezuelan towns barranquitas and 
san luis are a main element of the research 
in these three villages live nearly all the members of the soto 
clan the source of the largest documented family gene pool in the 
world 
wexler and her associates have drawn up a 9000person family 
tree that traces the spread of the gene defect that causes 
huntingtons from a single woman maria concepcion soto who died 
of the disorder near laguneta about 1880 
the defect causes neurons in a certain part of the brain to 
degenerate resulting in gradual loss of control of voluntary 
movement 
although disease is always fatal the defect lives on because 
the obvious symptoms of degeneration usually dont show up until 
long after childbearing age 
eduardo used to be a fisherman like everyone else in this tiny 
village of 16 shacks on stilts 3 feet above lake maracaibo you 
reach the place by a fourhour cabin cruiser ride south from the 
city of maracaibo through a slalom course of oil rigs 
now he spends his days on the wooden plank floor of a daughters 
8by10foot corrugated tin hut his arms and legs jerk about 
nervously his head lolls he can no longer talk 
eduardo can somehow make it to his feet and lurch outside to the 
tiny porch of rotting logs only to collapse next to a pile of damp 
fish nets smiling apologetically sometimes he falls overboard and 
he has to be fished out 
he is 65 at the rate his disease is progressing hell probably 
die within a year or two 
yelitzas father angel eduardo one of eduardo sotos 14 
surviving children is still a fisherman at 37 as he has been 
since the age of 10 
he goes out every day with a few relatives in a long narrow 
motorized dinghy and brings in about 200 pounds of corvina bagre 
and other local fish 
angel eduardo will be able to do this for five more years maybe 
a bit longer doctors say 
then he wont be able to control his movements enough to fling a 
net properly or navigate someone in his family maybe yelitza 
maybe her sister will have to take care of him until he dies that 
could take 20 years 
the 14 children of eduardo and carmen soto already have 58 kids 
of their own all at risk of huntingtons disease yelitza is one 
of them 
of the 14 four have double doses of the defective gene one 
from eduardo and one from carmen all of their children will get 
the disease 
dr james gusella a molecular biologist at massachusetts 
general hospital in boston examines the familys genes from the 
1500 blood samples wexler and young have collected since 1981 
using the extensive genetic records of the soto family gusella has 
developed a test to identify huntingtons disease victims before 
symptoms develop even before their birth 
the test involves the use of socalled dna markers chemical 
signposts on the deoxyribonucleic acid that makes up genes

<TEXT>
within a year or two he may be able to find the defective 
huntingtons gene itself the first crucial step toward a treatment 
or cure 
other research teams are now using this method to find genes 
that cause other hereditary disorders such as neurofibromatosis 
elephant mans disease cystic fibrosis alzheimers disease and 
manic depression 
the difference in genetic research now and before 1983 is like 
night and day and its because of this venezuelan family wexler 
says they showed that the strategy of using dna markers to find 
genes is correct 
the current genetic test is up to 96 percent accurate depending 
on how closely related are the patients who give their blood for 
genetic analysis 
a false positive on the test while unlikely would prove 
painfully significant especially when it comes to having a family 
wexler knows this firsthand she is at risk herself her mother 
died of the disease and wexler has decided not to have kids and 
not to take the test 
i stand to lose a lot if i find i have it and i stand to gain 
very little if i find out i dont since im happy now she says 
and i wouldnt want to subject my kids to being at risk or giving 
them the disease 
the soto clan remains resigned to living with a disease that has 
plagued their family for as long as any of them can remember 
a few of the women at laguneta have iuds but theyve already 
had several children 
the majority however think of it as something that is passed 
on in a mysterious and unavoidable way and which may or may not be 
given to them 
no one in laguneta really understands why wexler and her 
associates come back year after year to get blood samples give 
them eye tests and hand out food medicine and secondhand clothing 
and toys 
they are not always cooperative some family members refuse to 
give blood others disappear for days 
and even though a cure or at least a test could be developed 
within a few years as a result of research based on the soto 
family the disease is destroying laguneta and it may do the same 
to the sotos 
as recently as 40 years ago laguneta was the size of congo a 
thriving fishing village on stilts about an hour away by motorized 
launch 
the 1000 inhabitants of congo have electricity a school a 
visiting doctor and a church television antennae poke up from the 
wood or tin roofs and at least one person has a highspeed outboard 
motorboat 
the people in congo are quick to point out to visitors that one 
thing they do not have is saint vitus dance 
laguneta in contrast now has only about 150 inhabitants 
crammed in its 16 huts and a bleak empty church with lots of bats 
but no priest 
two of the huts have electricity no teachers come and except 
for wexlers research team no doctors come either 
the only dry way to go from hut to hut is with a boat and a pole 
the boys play baseball venezuelas favorite sport in the salty 
water that reaches just above their bellies bloated from 
intestinal parasites sanitation is primitive or nonexistent 
i give them tons of antiparasite medicine and in a week it 
wont do them any good what they need is education in hygiene 
complains dr juan sanchezramos a university of miami neurologist 
and a member of wexlers team 
and when the disease hits a fisherman like yelitzas father it 
means one less breadwinner for the family and one more burden for a 
sister or daughter 
so even though what they earn from fishing is a decent living by 
local standards the sotos can never quite pull out of their 
poverty 
even the ones in san luis are still illiterate because theyre 
too poor to send their kids to school they cant afford the 
books young says all their resources and energy go to caring 
for their sick elders 
and everyone in laguneta it seems wants to leave 
they all talk of getting off the water and on to dry land and 
going to barranquitas where unlike in congo soto family members 
can welcome them 
san luis a poor outlying neighborhood of maracaibo is 
considered the next step up the ladder 
unfortunately beyond laguneta the sotos increasingly will be in 
contact with people who know nothing about the disease 
from a single woman maria concepcion soto whom wexler 
suspects inherited the defect from a european sailor the gene has 
spread as the sotos have more surviving children 
in laguneta barranquitas and san luis as in many similar poor 
towns worldwide sex begins at an early age 
yelitza is very likely to have her first child by the time shes 
15 like her cousin yusmary margarita soto whom young also finds 
suspicious 
we know these kids are living time bombs wexler says we 
know when were testing them that some of them will get sick and 
there is nothing in the world that would make us happier than to be 
able to save them

editors note the setting is beautiful the history is grim a 
tale of punishment disproportionate to the crime today tourists 
can happily shudder at the ghosts of devils island and the 
neighboring dots in the atlantic off northern south america 
theyll pay a good price but not the kind exacted from the hapless 
inmates who once populated the penal colony on the islands of 
salvation 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
during their grim years of 
imprisonment on devils island both alfred dreyfus the martyr to 
french antisemitism and papillon the marseilles safecracker 
reached the same conclusion 
the breezeswept coconut palmdotted island off the northern 
coast of south america wouldnt be a bad place to spend a holiday 
or even the rest of ones life if it werent for the awful 
isolation the monotonous cuisine and the company of guards and 
fellow convicts 
now tourists are discovering the charms of les iles du salut 
the triangle of tiny islands with devils island at the 
northernmost apex that for nearly 100 years down to the end of 
world war ii served as frances notorious penal colony 
motor launches from the occasional cruise ships calling at ile 
royale the main island deposit eager mostly elderly passengers 
in the tiny harbor behind the rock jetty hundreds of convicts lost 
their lives building it in that pounding surf 
luxury yachts bob at anchor in a picturepostcard cove near the 
channel separating royale from stjoseph where sharks used to 
answer the 6 pm chapel bell tolling the burial at sea of another 
mec as the inmates called themselves 
henri charriere alias papillon watched in horror one 
evening as more than 100 sharks executed a deadly ballet with the 
flour sackshrouded body of his closest friend lifting it high 
above the water in their churning greed despite the heavy rocks 
and steelwire trussing meant to sink the corpse from sight 
there is no convict cemetery on the islands but camera buffs 
can focus their lenses on the graveyard for guards and their 
families where papillon disrespectfully dug into a tomb to hide 
sections of a boat he was assembling for a cavale an escape 
attempt 
postcards of the smaller more picturesque cimetiere denfants 
the childrens cemetery are available in the gift shop in the 
former guards dining room it also features at rather larcenous 
prices photocopies of french frontpage coverage of the 1894 
dreyfus treason trial and tshirts made in hong kong declaring that 
the wearer has accomplished levasion an escape from ile du 
diable devils island 
some naughtier french postcards in cartoon style show guards 
wives sunbathing topless to torment relegues lessdangerous 
prisoners working in their gardens 
the same long low building has a small hotel with a notice on 
the bulletin board that would have amused lifers dreyfus and 
papillon checkout time 11 am there is a snack bar and garden 
bistro with prices if not lambiance worthy of a sidewalk cafe 
along the champselysees 
two young officers from a cruise ship grumbled about this 
place still being a den of thieves after paying l2 for a beer 
and a pernod but the menu listing hot dogs at 350 did not seem 
to discourage a rush to the tables by sightseers arriving from the 
capital at cayenne on the noon helicopter the chopper lands in the 
meadow where guards used to test the guillotine by inserting banana 
stalks beneath the blade 
taking advantage of the visitor has long been part of the 
hospitality on les isles du salut the salvation islands 
papillon recounted in the bestseller memoirs he transcribed in 
13 school copybooks how the original dreyfus coffee mug and the 
authentic dreyfus mess tray inscribed with his initials were 
sold over and over again to the gullible breton seamen who every 
two years delivered from france a convoy of up to l800 
convicts handcuffed and chained to each other by the ankles 
a boatman will row the tourist the few hundred yards from royale 
over to devils island and show him the stone bench where capt 
dreyfus stared longingly in the direction of the france that had 
wrongly accused him of being a german spy and where papillon who 
thought himself wrongly convicted of murdering a montmartre pimp 
sat for hours day after day patiently plotting his l0th and at 
last successful escape attempt from the initials carved on the 
palm trees and the graffiti scrawled on the cell blocks now 
overgrown by the jungle its hard to tell which memorabilia were 
inscribed by tourists and which by inmates they began to arrive in 
1854 when napoleon iii conceived a penal colony in french guiana

like dreyfus and papillon visitors disembarking at ile royale 
first see the lighthouse the bakery and the stone boathouse that 
for a few hours until the last helicopter leaves serves as 
headquarters for the air patrol they are the only police on the 
island which has a yearround population of 20 
there is no crime here at all now laughed a wife of one of 
the caretakers hanging out clothes to dry in the flowerdecked

the main penitentiary buildings are atop a 600foot high plateau 
reached by a winding red dirt road built by convicts 
crumbling and ensnared by huge vines and tree roots the maximum 
security wing and its dungeons are a mecca for camera buffs they 
must be alert for the tarantula colonies that horrified papillon 
the prison hospital and the chapel are the next most popular 
attractions sought out on the tourist locator maps 
besides its sharkcalling sunset bell the chapel offers some 
poignant realistic frescoes executed over the years by the 
inmates one depicts christ preaching from a boat on the sea of 
galilee against an almost threedimensional background of green and 
brown judean hills another shows the prodigal son beaming a 
beatific smile of gratitude for the forgiveness shown by his 
tearful father

armed with huge garden shears when the doctor called once a

dont try rehabilitation here the warden welcomed him we try 
to break you we have only one rule keep your mouth shut absolute 
silence 
a reclusionnaire could have months added to his sentence for 
just mumbling merci to the guards for his pot of watery soup at 
noon or the unvarying plate of lentils at dusk both guards and 
prisoners wore slippers to muffle even the sounds of silence 
even now an unsettling serenity seems to hang over this 
abandoned island 
now one wonders if these lovely islands with their gorgeous 
empty beaches and sparkling blue lagoons can be saved from pillage 
by builders and developers already there are rumors of bulldozing 
the crumbling prison walls and ruins to make way for hotels 
condos boutiques discos cabanas and no doubt a marina and a 
casino 
surely that would be a crime but alas and alors crime is 
what these islands have always been all about

editors note president reagans aids commission appeared to 
be a sinking ship when a retired navy admiral took the helm last 
fall adm james d watkins guided the commission through 
exhaustive hearings that resulted in recommendations that were 
widely praised the admiral is the first to concede however that 
the commission has yet to deal with some of the thorniest questions 
swirling around aids 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
adm james d watkins remembers the advice 
that some of his closest friends offered when he asked them if he 
should take the helm of president reagans embattled aids 
commission 
james its a loser stay out of it 
that was last october the commission was sinking fast in a 
choppy sea of public ridicule and internal disarray the first 
chairman a physician unschooled in the ways of backstage 
washington had resigned critics were portraying the panel as a 
hopeless collection of doctrinaire archconservatives sprinkled 
with a few doctors who nonetheless knew little about aids 
i knew it was a can of worms of the first order watkins 
sats 
but he did not rise to chief of naval operations by doubting his 
own abilities moreover he was a washington veteran 
as a result watkins was more disposed to listen to other 
friends who told him i dont know anybody else who could do it 
i think you ought to try it 
still watkins knew his commission colleagues would not 
automatically salute his elevation to chairman 
i knew i would need their support at the outset so i made 
some calls he recalled in a recent interview id say what 
do you want do you want me to do it or not youve got to let me 
run it if im going to do it 
i got a positive response from all the commissioners i knew 
then i could probably make it there was no divisiveness they knew 
they were in trouble they all had professional reputations at 
stake they saw in me an opportunity 
run it he did 
watkins presented 60 pages of detailed chairmans 
recommendations for the commissions approval on feb 29 
including a call for spending an additional 20 billion over the 
next decade most of it on drug abusers three days later in a pro 
forma business meeting that took all of 10 minutes the panel 
adopted them unanimously 
in releasing the interim report watkins said we waste a lot 
of rhetoric and excessive time on a couple of little issues while 
the forest behind us is burning we believe some major changes in 
course are necessary 
the chorus of editorials lauding those recommendations was as 
loud as the one writing off the commission as a lost cause six 
months and nearly 400 witnesses earlier 
rep henry waxman dcalif a frequent critic of administration 
aids policies praised the watkins report as a firstrate set of 
recommendations that begin to deal with the aids epidemic 
responsibly and in detail 
dr mervyn silverman president of the los angelesbased 
american foundation for aids research said i continue to get 
more and more pleased as i see what watkins is doing 
admittedly the suggestions in the report to the president do 
not get at the thorniest questions swirling around aids 
watkins knows that he ticks off the remaining ones in shorthand 
form education testing confidentiality discrimination legal 
liability pharmaceutical doctors 
were really going to face some toughies he says but 
now were kind of trained weve been through the mill together 
watkins concedes that neither he nor the other members of the 
original panel knew much about aids when they started 
in retrospect it is clear that watkins went about managing the 
aids commission much the way he operated in the navy by immersing 
himself and his associates in a problem until answers floated to 
the surface

a favorite watkins phrase is the lights came on 
when he joined the joint chiefs of staff in 1982 as chief of 
naval operations watkins said i knew i had a weakness in the 
area of strategic planning strategic arms limitation talks i 
didnt have a good grasp of that area i knew it was going to be 
one of my primary responsibilities so independent of anything else 
going oni started an education program for myself 
i didnt know what the answer was going to be i had no idea 
but by about january 1983 i had been in it up to my eyeballs with 
my own staff 
the light came on in my own mind my god why dont we play to 
our strength instead of the soviet strength and our strength was 
technology applied technology not theoretical technology 
from that light as watkins tells it the other service 
chiefs lined up with him in recommending to the president that he 
consider moving to a defenseoriented nuclear strategy 
ergo the emergence of reagans strategic defense initiative 
sdi star wars 
im a strategy builder watkins says thats my business 
knowing a lot about how to deal with large groups of individuals to 
try to build programs that are built out of consensus not out of 
directive 
this is the approach i tried to take with the commission 
listen to the witnesses package up what they were saying rather 
than what was coming out of my preconceived notions that might be 
there 
its taken us time to come up on this learning curve 
with so many witnesses telling the commission essentially the 
same thing watkins heard the switches clicking again 
the lights come on here he said in research the lights 
come on in care were uncovering major problems in the health care 
delivery system the lights come on in iv drug abuse and its 
potential to be the longer term specter in aids transmission 
indeed if there is any criticism of the commissions initial 
report on the relatively noncontroversial aids issues dealt with 
so far it might be that the panel has yet to meet a recommendation 
it didnt like most but not all involve spending more money 
watkins notes that the report is quite specific and that it is 
not within the commissions charter to deal with government budget 
priorities 
the admiral and his wife of 37 years have reared six children on 
a navy salary they have seven grandchildren they are not wealthy 
before taking on the job as chairman of the aids commission 
watkins a member of the carnegie council on adolescent 
development was shaping what his resume calls a national program 
for personal excellence in youth to emphasize good education 
good health and good motivation 
relying on foundation grants and charitable contributions that 
work allowed him to supplement his retirement pay modestly he 
says without running afoul of federal bans against retired 
officers jumping immediately into the private and lucrative side of 
the defense business 
other federal rules against double dipping bar watkins from 
being paid for his work on the aids commission its a big 
chore he says its a fulltime job im going to be hurt 
financially by it ive got to be sensitive to that 
when the commission expires this summer watkins says he wants 
to continue his philanthropic work but he also says he needs 
to make some money 
the oneyear ban on his working for private defense companies 
will have long since expired by then watkins is a graduate of the 
nuclear reactor engineering course at the oak ridge national 
laboratory and he says work in commercial nuclear power industry is 
one possibility 
he acknowledges that his work on the aids commission is likely 
to enhance his reputation and enable him to emerge as a much 
betterknown public figure than he was before 
but it might not have worked out that way he said

varying degrees of contact between adopted children and their 
biological parents is a drastic departure from the traditional 
adoption practices there are a growing number of parents however 
who dont believe that secrecy is the best policy the michigan 
association for the openness in adoption is in the forefront of a 
movement to change the rules

when lynn cowsert gave her baby up 
for adoption 20 years ago she was required to sign a document that 
said she was abandoning her son 
signing that piece of paper devastated cowsert almost as much as 
the thought of never seeing her child again 
i was not abandoning my son cowsert now 40 said from her 
home in traverse city i was saying that i needed to give him a 
family that could provide him with the things that i could not at 
the time 
the wording of that release document was just one of the 
negative connotations that adoption carried with it at the time 
our society made him ashamed of me cowsert says they 
were saying heres this woman who dumped you when i was really 
trying to make a positive statement by giving him up 
knowing that her son will never know the details of his 
background or his biological parents weighs heavy on cowserts 
mind 
and it will always hurt that i will never have the chance to 
tell my son i love him and explain why i made the decision i did 
cowserts painful experience with the traditional closed 
adoption system has propelled her into the forefront of the open 
adoption movement 
she is now vice president of the michigan association for 
openness in adoption a new nonprofit organization formed to 
promote the acceptance education and research of open adoption 
open adoption can range from an anonymous exchange of 
information and letters between the birth parents and adoptive 
parents to prebirth meetings between the two sides with a plan for 
a continuing relationship after the child is born 
while this method has been practiced for about 15 years in 
varying degrees in a few places the program in this northwestern 
city on michigans lower peninsula is considered by many to be the 
most progressive in the united states 
its founder social worker james gritter has completed more 
than 150 open adoptions in eight years as child welfare coordinator 
at community family and childrens services of traverse city the 
social services arm of the catholic diocese of gaylord 
the organization is sponsoring the second national conference on 
open adoption in traverse city which was scheduled april 1417 
while most adoption agencies in the country are just beginning 
to offer open adoption generally in the form of a single meeting 
between the birth mother and adoptive parents very few will assist 
in setting up an adoption involving continuing contact says reuben 
pannor a former los angeles social worker who has written 
extensively about open adoption 
pannor says the practice is most common in california but that 
the traverse city program is as open as any he has seen 
about 75 percent of all pregnant women who come to gritters 
agency wind up requesting a fully open adoption including 
continuing personal contact with the child almost all want to 
choose the adoptive parents from profiles of couples in the 
agencys pool 
some women even choose to select the adoptive parents early in 
the pregnancy and have them accompany her to doctor appointments 
and act as natural childbirth coaches in the delivery room 
in those cases the adoptive parents can share that delicious 
anxiety that adoptive parents in a closed placement never 
experience gritter says at the same time the birth mother 
receives the emotional support that often is otherwise unavailable 
in most traditional adoptions the birth and adoptive parents 
are never identified to one another and the only information 
exchanged involves the birth mothers medical history and racial 
heritage 
that was the way mike spry and his wife jean rokos always had 
thought of adoption when they first heard about open adoption i 
thought it was an absolutely crazy idea spry says 
four years later the couple has two children adopted through 
the traverse city program 
now an enthusiastic supporter of open adoption spry founded and 
is president of the state advocacy group for openness in adoption 
he and about 20 other adoptive parents in the association have 
contributed to a book on their experiences which is due out in the 
fall 
the main reason the sprys changed their minds was their hope 
that it would spare their children the emotional burden many 
adoptees face due to the secrecy surrounding their biological 
parents 
the sprys have kept the doors literally open for both birth 
mothers

part of the beauty of this program is that we were there when 
they said goodbye to the babies so we can fully appreciate just 
what kind of sacrifice the birth mother has made spry says 
now i want to give something back i want that person to be a 
part of my life 
amy winn 20 of east lansing the birth mother of the sprys 
1yearold son says open adoption has been ideal for her 
the reason i know that ill never try to get him back is 
because i can always know how hes doing and how much hes being 
loved she says 
the potential for interference by the birth parent is a 
criticism that gritter hears often he contends that the open 
environment discourages harassment 
when a woman enters our program her whole plan is for the 
child to do well in life and for her to know how the child is 
doing for her to misbehave in any way really only serves to 
undercut her very own plan gritter says 
the open adoption agreement is legally nonbinding and either 
party can pull out at any time 
one of the major benefits is that the adoptive parents can be 
licensed as foster parents so the baby can be placed with them 
immediately after birth in closed adoptions the child must go to 
a separate foster family for several weeks until the end of the 
legal period during which the birth mother can change her mind 
with the benefit of getting the baby early comes the risk that 
the adoptive parents will have to give the baby back if the birth 
mother changes her mind before signing the release papers 
fifteen percent of the women who enter the traverse city program 
decide to keep their babies before that legal period is over 
gritter said thats a positive 
from the outset our goal is to find a way to keep the baby 
with the birth parents he says if the birth mother changes 
her mind were with her 100 percent 
such situations are difficult for the adoptive parents 
the sprys second child was with them four days when they found 
out his biological father was preparing to sue for custody they 
gave the baby back 
the program prepared us for that possibility spry says 
we never lost faith in the program and we jumped right back into 
it 
critics say women who request open adoption often do so because 
theyre psychologically unready to part with the child 
gritter counters that its perfectly natural for a woman to want 
to remain part of the childs life in fact he worries about birth 
mothers who seek a closed adoption 
we worry that their motivation is a sort of denial and that 
they wont come out of it as healthy as the birth parent who has 
actively done what she could for their child he says 
the traverse city program grew out of gritters desire to see 
birth parents treated more humanely and to allow adoptees to have 
as much autobiographical information as possible 
he also believes that the principles on which confidential 
adoption was originally based to avoid the stigma of illegitimacy 
are obsolete 
but leaders in the field of traditional adoption contend that 
open adoption is based on the faulty premise that closed adoption 
has not worked 
there has never been reliable data to show that adopted 
children suffer emotionally says jeff rosenberg spokesman for 
the national committee for adoption an adoption advocacy group 
based in washington dc 
rosenberg compares openness to joint custody in a divorce 
settlement 
its not joint physical custody but it is joint psychological 
custody he says 
his biggest fear centers on the relative newness of open 
adoption 
theres no way to know what kind of effect this will have on 
children he says what gives these people the right to 
experiment with childrens lives 
gritter says the effects of open adoption wont be known until 
the children mature and followup studies are done but he predicts 
that within 10 years all adoptions will feature some sort of 
openness because birth parents will insist on it 
its underlying principles are that honesty and openness are 
generally healthier than secrecy and deception says gritter 
its based on the idea that people are entitled to as much 
information about themselves as possible that they should have 
access to the information that is vital for their sense of self

editors note a michigan man seven years ago created love 
inc a clearinghouse and referral service to link those in need 
with the agency or group most able to help it has now grown to a 
network of 50 local programs in 14 states involving 1300 churches 
of 50 denominations 
</TEXT>

one year ago diana huckaba was in almost 
constant pain physical and mental 
a spinal defect resulting from childhood scoliosis and worsened 
by a later auto accident kept the allendale woman in bed all day 
thinking nobody cared a single mother she scraped by on 
social security disability checks 
then her furnace broke 
i had no money and didnt know where to turn says huckaba 
37 but as it turned out that furnace breaking was the turning 
point in my life 
when huckaba called the heating company she ended up speaking 
to the local program director of love inc before she knew it she 
had a new furnace soon after she had a new outlook on life 
in cases like these love inc provides the missing link says 
virgil gulker founder of the nationwide church services network 
gulker began the first love inc program in this southwest 
michigan city in 1981 while working for a churchsponsored 
community agency 
he was frustrated that the vast resources of area churches 
mainly their volunteers were not being tapped to help meet the 
communitys needs 
gulker saw the waste created by agencies and private 
organizations that duplicated services because they lacked a clear 
idea of what others did 
he was frustrated by the holiday food basket syndrome the 
tendency by churches to provide groceries at thanksgiving or a coat 
at christmas while ignoring deepseated problems faced daily by 
members of the community 
guided by the belief that a churchs resources if organized 
effectively could meet almost every need of a community gulker 
set out to create love inc local clearinghouses that would keep 
inventories of services provided in a community and link those in 
need with the agency or group most able to help where a need 
couldnt be met by an existing group love inc would tap the 
resources of the church 
since its inception love inc has expanded to 50 local programs 
in 14 states linking 1300 churches of 50 denominations and 
meeting about 12000 individual needs each month gulker says 
what sets love inc apart from other churchsponsored 
organizations is that it is strictly a clearinghouse and referral 
service its volunteers do not provide any direct assistance 
thats left up to the agencies or churches to which the person in 
need is referred 
we have a saying here we will not knowingly help anyone 
gulker says that sounds awful but its the only way a program 
like this can work 
if a person has a need that a government or private agency is 
not equipped to meet or if the person does not meet specific 
eligibility requirements a participating neighborhood church is 
called upon to help 
one of love incs most important responsibilities gulker says 
is to ensure that community services provided are not duplicated 
in one community clothing was provided so readily and without 
a governing policy that some families stopped doing their 
laundry he says when their clothes would get dirty theyd 
throw them out and get more 
through our failure to communicate as agencies and church 
representatives we have created that dependency we have said to 
these people theres no need to be personally responsible for 
your own situation we will take care of that for you 
to end the chronic dependents cycle love inc encourages 
churches to attach selfhelp conditions to assistance so the 
individual can become selfsufficent 
for example a person who continually asks a church to help meet 
rent payments would be required to improve budgeting skills with 
the help of a church volunteer 
other selfhelp conditions include academic or vocational 
training personal counseling or help with parenting shopping or 
cooking all of which are provided by church volunteers 
all participating churches are asked to survey their volunteers 
to find out what type of service each individual can best provide 
a physician may volunteer to help a sick child whose mother doesnt 
qualify for emergency medical aid while an auto mechanic may be 
able to donate a few hours to fix the car of a struggling family 
when someone in need contacts a love inc office program 
directors first conduct a background check to weed out roving 
panhandlers if the need is legitimate it is then funneled to the 
appropriate government agency or existing help group such as the 
salvation army 
in diana huckabas case love inc referred her to a 
littleknown government program which provided a new furnace 
now on the days when she is feeling healthy enough she works 
as a volunteer at the local love inc office 
since getting involved in the program the entire community 
has reached out to embrace me says huckaba who remarried in 
december my entire life has changed love inc has given me back 
my dignity 
gulker says government agencies are best able to deal with 
specialized needs such as spouse abuse or mental illness but as 
federal funds dry up church assistance becomes essential 
love inc which got a boost in november when it entered a 
partnership with the international relief agency world vision 
wants to have at least one program established in each of the 
united states within 10 years 
in fresno calif more than 2200 church members from a total 
of 50 area churches have volunteered to help with love inc cases 
since the chapter opened two years ago 
thirtythree local government agencies also are part of the 
chapters network 
all the agencies have responded very favorably they feel that 
the church is an untapped resource and theyre at the breaking 
point says program director larry waddell 
he said that of the approximately 400 requests for assistance 
that come into the office each month love inc can arrange to meet 
about 90 percent of those needs about 40 percent of those through 
existing agencies the rest are handled by church volunteers 
kathleen busse opened a love inc chapter in the chicago suburb 
of clarendon hills about two years ago 
there are more than 200000 people in the area served by the 
chapter and about 85 requests for assistance come in each month of 
those the chapter can successfully refer about 60 cases 
sixtyfour churches now participate in the program 
i think weve been doing a bangup job but we have nothing to 
compare it to really she says theres no precedent for it

pacific coast today are all descendants of a single colony of fewer 
than 100 that survived the slaughter of 19thcentury hunters 
perhaps one of the reasons they escaped extinction is an 
overwhelming sex drive which also explains some other 
characteristics of these curious mammals whose mating habits are 
often bloody affairs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
its an annual ritual of 
sex and violence on the coast of california 
once nearly extinct some 1800 northern elephant seal cows and 
600 to 700 bulls converge to fight breed and nurse a new 
generation of 1800 pups on the beaches sand dunes and offshore 
island at ano nuevo state reserve 50 miles southeast of san 
francisco 
from december to march the reserve is a major rookery in the 
elephant seals habitat which ranges from off san francisco to 
central baja california 
on a typical day a small elephant seal cow is seen desperately 
worming her way across the sand toward the pacific ocean pursued 
by epo3 a twoton male 
the 16footlong bull who dominates a harem of some 50 cows 
quickly overtakes the female ignoring her growls of protest as he 
mates 
two younger bulls sneaking toward the nearby harem are routed by 
epo3 who rears up and trumpets a belligerent warning the invaders 
do the same but flee nonetheless 
later two other bulls engage in battle biting and trumpeting 
for 10 minutes they are drenched with blood as they fight for 
access to cows and a chance to pass their characteristics to future 
generations 
sex and violence its the basics of life says burney le 
boeuf a biologist at the university of california santa cruz who 
has been studying the seals for two decades for the government 
if theres any doubt reproduction is fundamental to all life 
processes how an animal behaves and what it looks like then go to 
ano nuevo and look at elephant seals breeding 
le boeuf believes the seals need to conserve energy for 
reproduction accounts for their ability to fast for 90 days hold 
their breath for up to 48 minutes while under water and repeatedly 
dive to depths of 3000 feet or more where no other marine mammals 
venture except possibly beaked and sperm whales 
by diving to such depths pregnant seal cows slow their 
metabolism as they feed on a rich supply of squid skates rays and 
ratfish le boeufs studies suggest they expend minimal energy so 
they can be in prime condition to deliver and nurse their pups 
only the biggest and fiercest bull seals get to sire offspring 
so natural selection has gradually made the bulls extremely 
aggressive and given them tools to scare other bulls elephantlike 
snouts the ability to trumpet and body weights three to seven 
times that of the cows 
the bigger the male the better the fighter and the better 
the fighter the better the lover le boeuf says you dont get 
to be a good lover or a father unless youre a good fighter 
the seals fearless behavior almost caused their demise they 
were easy targets for 19thcentury hunters who sought blubber for 
tanning lamp fuel a machinery lubricant and for making 
margarine paint clothing and soap 
unlike south americas more abundant southern elephant seals 
northern elephant seals were nearly extinct by 1892 with fewer 
than 100 surviving on isla de guadelupe 150 miles off bajas west 
coast 
all 100000 northern elephant seals alive today descended from 
that colony which was given mexican government protection in 1922 
male elephant seals reach 16 feet in length and weigh up to 
4000 pounds females reach 9 feet and 1600 pounds their life 
span is about 14 years for males 16 to 17 years for females 
le boeuf says male will mate about 10 times a day 
they will try to mate anything dead or pregnant females 
other males even pups he says theyre so indiscriminate its 
amazing 
our most famous seal was adrian we estimate he inseminated 
over 250 different females in his lifetime its a record

because a dominant male ruthlessly fights and sometimes kills 
weaker bulls intruding on his harem 30 percent to 80 percent of 
the males never mate 
le boeuf a 53yearold louisianan compares the scene to a 
sleazy singles bar where the female starts the fight all the 
males fight and she goes off with the winner 
the females almost always protest says teri pate 22 one 
of le boeufs students i get pleasure whenever a female gets a 
good bite 
because fight they must to father pups bulls evolved their 
threatening big snouts shaped like stubby elephant trunks 
its like antlers on a stag le boeuf says 
on land the seals hold their breath up to 25 minutes during 
naps which allows the bulls to save energy for fighting and 
mating and the cows to conserve energy for nursing 
because the bulls must guard their harems they fast during the 
threemonth breeding season deriving energy and water from 
blubber the cows also fast during the 34 days they spend on land 
to deliver their pups and nurse them with some of natures richest 
milk 
a pup goes from about 85 pounds at birth to 300 pounds at 
weaning in four weeks le boeuf says theyve literally been 
injected with fat from the mother the cows lose about 40 percent 
of their weight during four weeks of nursing 
as they finish nursing the cows breed becoming pregnant again 
then they swim to sea for 72 days leaving weaned pups on the beach 
to fend for themselves and learn to swim and dive five percent to 
30 percent of the pups do not survive 
in his studies le boeuf has glued cylindershaped timedepth 
recorders to the backs of 20 females each 2600 batteryoperated 
recorder contains a pressure sensor a lightemitting diode and 
film to measure the time and depth of each dive 
the studies showed that pregnant cows spend 85 percent of their 
time under water and only a few minutes at the surface between 
dives they dive to an average of 1300 to 2100 feet and sometimes 
to 3000 feet nearly twice as deep as any other seal species the 
pressure 90 times greater than at the surface would kill humans 
le boeuf theorizes the seals can stay submerged so long because 
they conserve oxygen by slowing their heart rate lowering 
metabolism and temperature and reducing blood flow to organs like 
the liver and kidneys they also may sleep while diving 
this allows the seals to escape to depths uninhabited by their 
only predator great white sharks they eat a rich food supply with 
little competition weight is gained rapidly to prepare for nursing 
the pups they will deliver the next december 
by weighing cows after they mate and again when they return to 
molt or shed fur 72 days later le boeuf found each cow gained 2 
pounds daily at sea 
le boeuf who started out studying hormones and social behavior 
in rats and dogs first watched seals fighting to establish their 
pecking order during a visit to ano nuevo in 1968 
he later began weighing seals and studying their blood and 
metabolism he used hydrogen peroxide and hair dye to mark names on 
their fur names like et fbi cia yin and yang so he could 
follow individuals for their lifetimes 
le boeuf says seals are easy to study because they do everything 
in the open and dont fear humans 
we get insights into other animals and our own lives by 
studying one animal in depth he says were all products of 
natural selection the mating strategies humans followed our 
ancestors before civilization were probably not much different 
than mating strategies in elephant seals

tom smothers in his familiar deadpan 
delivery says his new show with his brother dick is just like old 
times except that cbs doesnt have a censorship department any 
more 
tom is exaggerating but his point is that much has changed in 
the nearly 20 years since cbs fired the smothers brothers for their 
political impudence 
theyre now back on the air with the smothers brothers comedy 
hour for a spring tryout run on cbs comedian pat paulsen is back 
with them heaping satiric abuse on his rivals 
the original smothers brothers show in the late 1960s became a 
rally against the vietnam war where the brothers and their guests 
attacked the war in song and satire it soon turned into open 
warfare between the smothers and cbs which began censoring entire 
segments of the show they were finally fired on april 3 1969 
although tom says cbs still has some qualms about 
politicalization apparently few eyebrows are being raised 
the brothers kid that they could take some of their old 
antivietnam routines write in nicaragua and they would still be 
relevant 
nicaragua is just like vietnam tom says big people 
beating up on little people 
the government still doesnt listen to its citizens adds 
dick 
although the smothers brothers were the darlings of the under30 
set in the 1960s without their television platform they quickly 
faded from sight abc gave them a brief summer outing in 1970 and 
nbc gave them a try in 1975 but the old sass was gone and there 
were few targets for their satire 
the current young generation hardly knows them but cbs hopes 
this exposure will find them a new audience among the young their 
appearance last year on hollywood squares and commercials for 
magnovox helped keep their faces before the public 
tom says their act has changed over the past 20 years 
we cant do what we did 20 years ago says tom im 51 
dicks 49 were too old to do the old routine we cant do the 
mom liked you best stuff any more 
dick adds george burns told us that when he and gracie allen 
were on radio they were having trouble suddenly george realized 
they were doing jokes that were for younger people they had 
matured and they had to do material that was appropriate for their 
ages 
were in a renaissance right now says tom the big change 
in our act is that we switched the focus to dick for the first 10 
or 12 years the focus of the act was on tom the quality of a 
comedy team really depends on the straight man look at laurel and 
hardy abbott and costello rowan and martin dick carries the 
weight onstage i carry the weight offstage 
dick is the straight man in the act tom is the cutup comic who 
usually plays dumb but away from the stage tom is the acts mover 
and shaker dick usually left the business side to him while he 
raced automobiles he says now hes given up racing because of his 
eyesight 
i ride horses now he explains the horse has better 
eyes 
for the first time too the brothers live apart when he 
remarried dick moved to virginias horse country tom has a place 
in sonoma county calif where the brothers own a winery he also 
has an apartment in los angeles 
dick met his new wife lorraine while performing in richmond 
they have a 9monthold daughter sarah dick also has three older 
children 
tom who is now single has a son in college

amy irving came to new york from los angeles for 
only three hours just to see south africa playwright athol fugard 
the thoughtful serious actress felt she had to appear in 
fugards the road to mecca a threecharacter play about an 
eccentric artist facing the loss of her independence 
in the drama an older woman played by yvonne bryceland is the 
object of a dispute an afrikaner minister portrayed by fugard 
himself wants to put the woman in a nursing home an action 
opposed by a feisty angry teacher that was the role miss irving 
wanted to play 
the playwright and the actress who had never met before talked 
about the play and its characters and briefly acted out several 
scenes 
i was flying when i left the place miss irving said the 
other day during a rehearsal break it was a thrilling 
experience athol has so much energy by the time i left the 
audition i just said so when do we start working she got the 
part 
for a road to mecca now playing at offbroadways promenade 
theater its journey to new york wasnt accomplished so quickly 
the plays premiere took place at the yale repertory theater in 
connecticut in 1984 the following year there was a production in 
london by the national theater 
but a new york production was stymied by casting problems 
particularly over whether miss bryceland a south african should 
be allowed to appear here actors equity felt the role should be 
played by an american actress 
miss bryceland finally did appear on an american stage nearly a 
year ago when the road to mecca was mounted at the spoleto 
festival usa in charleston sc miss irving was in none of 
those productions 
that was part of the appeal to me the challenge she says 
working in a threecharacter play in a situation where the others 
have pretty much found their characters 
but she discovered during rehearsals that there were very few 
moments when she was aware that fugard and miss bryceland had done 
the play before 
thats because they have a new set to work on and theres 
completely different blocking miss irving says so it is new 
for them as well and besides they are always finding new values 
in the play 
the actress also had the pleasure of being directed by the man 
who wrote the words 
its easier being directed by the author because so often 
youre not quite sure what the writer meant she says with 
this production you can just turn to the director and say what 
did the writer mean sometimes hell remember and sometimes he 
wont and sometimes hell remember but be open to other 
intrepretations 
miss irving wife of filmmaker steven spielberg has been able 
to move easily between the very different worlds of television 
movies and theater filmgoers remember her best as the spiteful 
high school student in carrie or as the love interest in 
barbara streisands yentel 
its nice being able to alternate she says after i 
finished being a location wife for a while i went to the 
williamstown theater festival and did three sisters and then went 
right into a movie called crossing delancey and then this 
the theater is miss irvings mainstay and she has impeccable and 
lengthy stage credentials she has been in the theater since she 
was 9 months old carried on stage by her mother actress priscilla 
pointer it was a production of rumpelstiltskin at the san 
francisco actors workshop a group started by her father jules 
irving in 1954 
irving then became artistic director at the lincoln center 
repertory theater in new york theater inundated miss irvings life 
and the lives of her brother and sister she knew she would have to 
make it her profession but was unsure what her parents would say 
after they saw me in my first offbroadway production they 
breathed a sigh of relief and encouraged me miss irving says 
but they also said just because youve been in theater all your 
life doesnt mean you know everything about it they encouraged 
me to get classical training 
a year at the american conservatory theater in san francisco and 
three years studying in london provided the foundation 
my parents taught me a great respect for the theater miss 
irving says you dont just go and do it you learn your craft 
first such as the exploration of the text and your responsibility 
to the other people on stage 
thats what shes doing at the time of the interview getting 
ready for the opening of the road to mecca and putting on stage 
what fugard the playwright and fugard the director wants 
i havent got a clue how this comes across to an audience 
she says i have talked to several people who have seen the play 
including my mother and they were very excited by it i hope 
theyre right

roadside spotlights flashed on as 
the 10yearold truck loaded with foodstuffs and silent peasants 
rumbled down a dirt highway in the midnight darkness near this 
jungle crossroads 
from behind the blinding beams stepped four us border patrol 
agents and a group of bolivian police they stopped the truck 
inspected it and found beneath bundles of food a costly cache of 
sulfuric acid which is used to make cocaine paste 
once unheardof such spot checks are becoming more and more 
common in the chapare a semitropical lowland region where 90 
percent of bolivias huge coca crop is produced 
helping direct the effort are the four us agents who 
volunteered to transfer from the usmexican frontier to train 
bolivian police officers in drug interdiction 
before their arrival in october cocaine traffickers controlled 
the roads around villa tunari about 60 miles northeast of the city 
of cochabamba now the drug dealers move warily sometimes falling 
into police traps 
on march 28 the bolivian police and the border agents snared 
two trucks carrying an estimated 80000 worth of 
cocaineprocessing chemicals at paracti a control point on the 
main road to the chapare 
paracti is the agents base they rough it there in a 
12by9foot guardhouse filled with supplies clothing weapons and 
other equipment and an electrical generator 
theres room only for two bunk beds so the four agents take 
turns sleeping the guardhouse has no running water 
nevertheless darryl brown a bearded 40yearold californian 
said he would volunteer for a second tour when his current 
fourmonth stint ends 
here we can have an impact he said 
the work sometimes can be hazardous 
one february night brown was among a force of border patrol 
officers us drug enforcement administration dea agents and 
bolivian police who took over a stretch of jungle road used as a 
landing strip by traffickers at dawn when a small plane landed and 
inside the group found 963 pounds of cocaine paste 
the pilot offered them 50000 to let him fly on with his cargo 
a hostile crowd of hundreds of farmers and peasants many of whom 
are employed in cocainepaste production gathered 
a woman stepped forward with bundles of us dollars to offer as 
a bribe but was arrested the crowd then started throwing rocks and 
sticks of dynamite at the officers barricades of burning tires and 
lumber were thrown up trapping the officers until reinforcements 
could arrive and disperse the mob with gunfire 
brown suffered a cut on his cheek two of the protesters were 
killed 
the agents are part of a 60man us force trying to help stem 
drug production in bolivia about 30 us army special forces 
members are training a special bolivian police antidrug unit 
called the leopards and 25 to 30 dea agents help coordinate in 
cocaine interdiction the us army has thrown six huey helicopters 
into the effort 
we want to make it so expensive to produce cocaine that it is 
no longer cost effective said one dea agent who asked not to be 
identified bolivia has the potential and probably is the most 
successful program in south america 
the efforts in the chapare which is about the size of new 
jersey has made it difficult for cultivators to sell their 
harvested coca leaves to drug processors according to col nicolas 
anaya camacho the regional leopard commander 
a 100pound sack of coca leaves the raw material for cocaine 
sells for 25 to 30 it sold for 200 three years ago in july 
1986 when 170 us troops flew in to assist in a special twomonth 
operation the price plunged from 125 to 40 which is about what 
it cost to grow the crop 
with prices sinking below the cost of production many coca 
farmers are joining a government program to eradicate coca acreage 
about 3400 acres of coca have been voluntarily destroyed by 
farmers who receive 2000 for each 25 acres eradicated 
the money is intended for crop substitution the united states 
contributes 350 of the total and the rest comes from the bolivian 
government 
the us government has earmarked 33 million a year for crop 
substitution and development programs according to the us 
embassy in la paz but coca farmers and many bolivian officials 
say more is needed 
we need at least 300 million over a threeyear period to 
combat the cocaine industry effectively foreign minister 
guillermo bedregal said recently we are at war with the cocaine 
mafia and if we dont defeat them forget democracy and be 
prepared for the violence found in peru and colombia

sen albert gore jr is seeking to establish 
his differences with the middle east policies of democratic 
presidential rivals jesse jackson and michael dukakis in the weeks 
before the crucial new york primary 
nowhere does the issue of us policy toward israel and the 
middle east loom larger than in new york where jews cast 22 
percent of the votes in 1984 the state holds its presidential 
primaries april 19 
many jews remain wary of jackson who on a 1979 trip to the 
middle east embraced palestinian liberation organization leader 
yassar arafat and called israel a state of oppressors he also 
described the plo as not merely a terrorist organization even 
though it has engaged in some terrorist acts it is a government in 
exile 
jacksons relations with the jewish community were further 
exacerbated in 1984 when he called new york hymietown 
gore of tennesse has said he was dismayed by jacksons 
embrace of arafat and castro and that he has profound 
differences with jackson on middle east issues 
gore also criticized dukakis for endorsing a letter that 30 us 
senators sent to israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir criticizing 
shamirs opposition to an exchange of occupied land for recognition 
by arab states he said shamirs objections to secretary of state 
george shultzs peace plan deserved more consideration 
the associated press asked the presidential candidates to spell 
out their proposals for dealing with the palestinian unrest 
including who should control a new homeland and how they would 
protect israel 
every candidate except jackson specifically mentioned united 
nations resolutions 242 and 338 which establish the right to exist 
of all the states in the middle east as the basis for a settlement 
here is what the democrats said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the current unrest is founded on a middle east policy that is 
fatally flawed it has left israel with false security and 
palestinians with no security and the united states helpless 
we need an alternative policy in the middle east which moves 
the process that began at camp david to the next progressive step 
mutual recognition is the key to security in the middle east 
for israel and for our other allies 
this policy should be built on several principles the right 
of israel to exist the right of the palestinian people to 
selfdetermination including an independent homeland the right of 
lebanon to sovereignity and freedom from imposed partition 
normalized ties between the us and all middle east nations 
and demilitarization of the region and increased humanitarian aid 
an international conference on the middle east involving all 
the parties concerned including the chosen representatives of the 
palestinian people will be a giant step towards peace 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the issue is both the palestinian people and the israeli 
people there cannot be a solution for one and not the other i 
believe that un resolutions 242 and 338 must be the basis for a 
settlement this means a willingness on the part of israel to 
exchange land for peace it also means a firm and unequivocable 
commitment on the part of the palestinians and the arab states to 
live up to peaceforland 
our role is to facilitate the peace process but not to dictate 
the terms of a peace settlement the final status of the 
territories is a matter to be decided through direct negotiatons 
between the parties themselves but i will say that my 
administration will not recognize the plo or negotiate with it 
until and unless it fully and credibly accepts un resolutions 242 
and 338 eliminates its call for the destruction of the state of 
israel and ends its support of terrorism 
in the gore administration no one will ever have reason to 
doubt the american commitment to the survival and security of the 
state of israel i will continue to supply israel with the 
military aid necessary to deter its enemies 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the israeli authorities have a legitimate right to restore 
order in response to violent demonstrations and attacks on israeli 
security forces but it is clear that in several instances military 
personnel have used excessive force 
there is an urgent need to get the peace process moving again 
tragedy has produced a unique opportunity to begin the first steps 
toward resolving the future of the territories 
direct negotiations between the parties are necessary to 
determine the ultimate status of the territories a solution cannot 
be imposed on the region the negotiations must be based on the 
principles of un resolutions 242 and 338 which include 
recognition of israels right to exist within secure borders and 
must also in the words of camp david recognize the legitimate 
rights of the palestinian people and their just requirements

until very recently the reagan administration sat by 
passively and did not pursue a middle east peace accord we have to 
show that the united states is willing to play an active and 
involved role in getting the parties together palestinians who 
favor israels right to exist in peace who accept un resolutions 
242 and 338 should be welcomed into the process as president i 
will make facetoface direct negotiations between israelis and

vice president is fully in support of secretary shultzs peace 
plan which is built upon the reagan peace iniatives and in which 
is embodied un resolutions 242 and 338 we believe the process 
has to result in direct talks between israel and the 
jordanianpalestinian delegation 
the question of who should control a new territory is 
something that would have to be determined as a result of the 
negotiatons said hart he would continue to protect israel and 
support israel he believes the peace process has to take into 
account the aspirations of the palestinian people and at the same 
time has to ensure the security of the state of israel 
bush in response to a questionnaire that the american jewish 
committee put out two months ago said my commitment to israels 
security is unshakable he added i reject the possibility of 
dealing with the plo until it renounces terrorism and violence and 
accepts un resolutions 242 and 338

i strongly support a middle east settlement that would be the 
result of direct negotiations between the nations of israel the 
hashemite kingdom of jordan and the legitimate representatives of 
the palestinian people who would agree to abide by united nations 
resolutions 242 and 338 
i agree with prime minister shamir that any talks concerning 
territorial adjustment should first be preceded by a period of 
palestinian selfrule in the west bank i reject the concept of 
trading territory for peace i do not believe that there will 
be lasting peace in the middle east until iran syria saudi 
arabia jordan and other arab nations cease belligerency toward 
israel and acknowledge the right of israel to exist as a sovereign 
state in the middle east 
given the current climate of hostility against israel on the 
part of her arab neighbors any surrender of territory in the near 
future would seriously imperil the ability of israel to defend 
herself

jay mcinerneys novel of redemption in the fast lane of the 
1980s is a slim ultrahip volume set in the dimlylighted 
discotheques and cocainedusted bathroom stalls of new york city 
the film by james bridges equally slender is so true to the 
book it seems that mcinerney who adapted it for the screen could 
have handed in a copy of the novel in lieu of the final draft of 
the script 
but what might have been a pedestrian exercise in book 
illustration is in the hands of bridges a simple artistically 
told story that illuminates the spiritual themes in mcinerneys 
novel instead of trivializing them 
the movie could as easily have been nothing more than a star 
vehicle for michael j fox a dubious choice to play the narrator 
called jamie in the film but he nevertheless takes a pretty good 
shot at his most demanding movie role he could have just come off 
as alex keaton on an allnight binge in the big apple 
as we meet jamie an aspiring writer toiling as a fact checker 
at stodgy gotham magazine he has recently been abandoned by 
amanda his ambitious vacuous fashionmodel wife haunted by 
visions of the mother who abandoned him by dying he loses himself 
in shallow temptations of the flesh provided by tad allagash his 
worldclass barcrawler best friend 
keifer sutherland simply is allagash phoebe cates is blinking 
perfection as amanda who is more an idea than a character in the 
movie as in the book tracy pollan plays tads downtoearth cousin 
who represents jamies salvation 
jason robards steals scenes as an alcoholic hasbeen editor at 
jamies magazine his son sam has a small part as a clubgoer 
swoosie kurtz is the goodhearted coworker who tries to help 
jamie but has her own agenda and frances sternhagen as clara 
jamies boss turns the villainess of the book into a palpable 
visage of authoritarian disapproval even while welling up with 
tears when forced to fire jamie for incompetence 
dianne wiest as jamies beloved dying mother is swathed in an 
almost christlike glow for her brief but pivotal role in 
flashback on her death bed she earnestly asks him what its like 
being a young man does he sleep with many girls does he like it 
is it fun since the entire story turns on the believability of 
their love for each other these moments are especially demanding 
on actors and director and they work wonderfully 
the movie starts just like the book and ends just like the book 
and contains much of the dialogue exactly as in the novel bridges 
has gone with an odd literal translation of a dream scene inspired 
by jamies obsession with the blaring tabloidheadline story of a 
coma baby imperiled inside its dying mothers womb 
in the book jamie dreams of talking with coma baby through 
its mothers transparent belly the scene is rendered unto et 
in the movie by way of special effects which is ok since it is a 
dream after all otherwise bridges direction is unobtrusive and 
often quite lovely many of the shots gordon willis was the 
cinematographer would stand alone as photographs 
those who have read the book will leave bright lights big 
city satisfied those who havent will have to work a little 
harder to see beneath the surface 
bright lights big city went through several writers and a 
director before producers sydney pollack and mark rosenberg 
reverted to the basics of the book and put bridges urban 
cowboy china syndrome on the job under severe time 
constraints because of foxs tv schedule despite those problems 
the movie is a nice piece of work

michael murray and the organ of the cathedral of st john the 
divine telarc 
 
michael murrays program is designed to show off some of the 
special qualities of the organ of the episcopal cathedral of st 
john the divine in new york city one of the worlds largest 
churches the organ is likewise immense with 143 ranks of pipes 
and murray gives pride of place to some of the solo stops for which 
organ builder em skinner was famous 
where else but perhaps in this recording of the emperors 
fanfare by padre antonio soler will your hear a tuba major a 
cornopean and an ophicleide in full cry 
the cathedrals distinctive herald trumpet mounted under the 
west rose window a good 500 feet from the rest of the organ is 
also shown off in john dunstables agincourt hymn and henry 
purcells trumpet tune 
still the recording can only hint at the feeling of being 
within that enormous unfinished space 200 feet wide and 12 stories

pontiac mca lyle lovett 
 
with a bone dry sense of humor and a touch of classy 1940s 
swing lyle lovett is molding country music into his own personal 
expression of wit love cynicism and occasional touching despair 
pontiac his second album establishes lovett as an 
important country and western crossover artist 
an east texas boy who relocated to nashville his influences are 
more townes van zandt and guy clark than jimmie rodgers and hank 
williams and with his sharply chiseled face pencilthin suit and 
roostercombed hair he looks more like a caricature from a deco 
design than a countrywestern singer but he can kick youknowwhat 
with the best of em 
hear the echoes of bob willis in give back my heart i 
said oooh give back my heart you kickerredneck woman take your 
boots and walk out of my life yeehah 
then he turns around on the title track a somber ballad lovett 
fantasized about an old man in austin who parked his pontiac in the 
same spot each day and the girl there across the street she 
sits on her front porch swing she never realized what i told her 
with my eyes how back in the second war i killed 20 german boys 
with my own bare hands 
the album opens with if i had a boat wherein lovett 
combines fantasies about being a cowboy and a sea captain on this 
cut his creamy smooth voice is most reminiscent of jesse 
winchester 
like winchester much of lovetts material is whimsical at a 
recent appearance at the bottom line in new york he felt obliged 
to note at the outset im only kiddin 
take shes no lady shes my wife please i cant 
remember how i met her seems like shes always just been hangin 
here off my right arm 
hes not kidding though about the threepiece horn section 
backup singers and cello that now accompany him 
lovett notes wryly that he seems to write a lot of songs about 
marriage even though hes never been but one of these is the most 
stunning cut on the album la county which manages to be a 
haunting ballad set to a quick texas twostep 
lovett said he had attended the wedding of a friend and thought 
the sensitive thing to do was to write a song about it what a 
sensitive boy and they kissed each other and they turned 
around and they saw me standing in the aisle well i did not say 
much i just stood there watching as that 45 told them 
goodbye yes in the song at least he shoots them

alan alda the star of a new life 
recently talked about a dispute between the films director and 
writer during the closing days of shooting the paramount film 
the exchange went something like this 
director after cutting a scene in half then half again you 
dont need it get rid of it its holding the picture up 
writer are you crazy thats got information the audience 
must know to understand these characters 
director then send them a telegram dont waste my time with 
this scene 
writer there are two good jokes in there im not wasting the 
audiences time 
both figures of course were alan alda and he reports happily 
that the writer won the argument why did that please him 
because i think i identify more closely with the writer he 
said 
performing three functions on a bigbudget movie would seem to 
risk a severely split personality not alda he remains one of the 
most stable of show business personalities like his character 
hawkeye pierce of tvs mash he seems able to face any 
situation with a sanity insulated with sly humor 
a new life which drew a mixed reaction from critics 
concerns life after the divorce of longmarried alda and 
annmargret he explores the swinging single scene with his 
hedonist pal hal linden while she returns to school to become a 
teacher the script resulted from long research by alda 
i talked to a lot of people who had been through divorce 
maybe a couple dozen also to professionals who had talked to 
dozens of people who had been going through similar 
circumstances he said i discovered that many of my 
preconceptions had been wrong 
some people i had known for years started telling me things 
they had never told me before intimate details of their lives 
neither of us was embarrassed because we both knew i was just 
trying to get at the truth for this screenplay 
in the film alda ends up with a new partner while annmargret 
does not alda a longtime feminist denies any suggestion of a 
double standard for her she winds up with something that at 
that particular time in her life is more important the feeling of 
being free and knowing that shes in control of her own life 
costar annmargret has long been noted for her sexcharged 
roles alda paints a different picture shes so sweet so shy 
and unassuming i always had to ask her to talk up she talks in 
such a quiet voice she never wants to intrude on anybody yet she 
has what the character needs an inner strength she is a strong 
woman who has been through a lot of reversals 
aldas life appears to be remarkably free of reversals he was 
born into the theatrical world the son of robert alda who played 
george gershwin in the 1945 film rhapsody in blue alan got his 
first exposure to show business by accompanying his father on the 
burlesque circuit at 16 he made his stage debut in a pennsylvania 
summer theater where he appeared in white cargo with the 
stripper rose la rose 
by the time he was 26 alda was married and the father of three 
daughters and making a fair living in the new york theater as well 
as occasional films after starring in the owl and the pussycat 
and the apple tree he was lured by the pilot script of a tv 
series about the mobile army surgical hospital in the korean war 
mash proved to be an 11year triumph 
his images of the series 
the first image that always comes into my mind is that dark 
cavern of a sound stage that we would lock ourselves into at 8 
oclock in the morning or even before it got light he said 
and we wouldnt leave until 8 oclock at night after it was dark 
we never saw daylight for six months of the year 
the second image is the fun we had there the laughing the 
excitement of finding a scene of making something work and keeping 
after it until it did work i dont know of any other television 
show that routinely did 20 takes to make something work 
is there a danger of hawkeye overwhelming his career 
i dont think so i dont think ive seen signs of it but i 
dont know 
this whole thing the career acting doing the work then 
reading about it and finding out where you stand its all like 
riding a horse youre just hurtling along at what seems like 100 
miles an hour you pass people on the sidelines who are shouting at 
you but you cant understand it youre just hoping you dont fall 
off

with little more than a big mouth and a 
prayer 17yearold estelle williams left her rural alabama home 
more than a halfcentury ago and headed north to pittsburgh with 
the idea that life would be better for an ambitious young woman 
with big plans 
i was never happy in the south i was never happy with life 
for blacks there she said i wanted better things and i saw no 
way of getting them in the south 
mrs williams now 71 was one of nearly a million blacks who 
left the south between 1915 and 1940 in hope of finding a better 
life in the north 
the human aspects of the great migration are examined in a 
traveling exhibit called field to factory afroamerican 
migration 19151940 
a ku klux klan membership card the photograph of a hanging 
tree used in lynchings and tools blacks used while working in the 
industrial north are among the items included in the exhibit it is 
a smaller version of one already in place at the smithsonian 
institutions national museum of american history in washington 
documents letters to relatives photographs and other items 
from that period are on a twoyear national tour that began at 
carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh and ends at the south 
carolina state museum in columbia sc in august 1990 said 
spencer crew a museum familylife curator who spearheaded both 
projects 
other stops are scheduled in jacksonville fla yonkers ny 
baltimore birmingham ala and columbus ohio 
whether youre black or white moving is something a lot of 
people have done crew said many people have relatives who 
left rural areas and moved to northern cities or immigrants who 
moved from other countries to this country 
mrs williams began planning her move when she was in grade 
school she was inspired by an aunt from pittsburgh who frequently 
visited her southern relatives telling them about life in 
pennsylvania 
i was more or less a rebellious young lady she said my 
mother worked in white peoples houses on farms and she tried to 
make we work on the farm but i refused i told her id stay inside 
the house id wash iron cook or anything but i wasnt born to 
work in the fields 
after contributing to her familys support she saved the rest 
of the 50 cents she weekly earned cooking and cleaning in the homes 
of whites eventually she had enough for oneway train fare to 
pittsburgh 
when she arrived she quickly realized her vision of the north as 
a land of limitless opportunity wasnt accurate 
racism existed in pennsylvania also she said and living and 
working conditions in the big city werent much better sometimes 
they were worse 
when i saw where my aunt lived she had one little room and 
the use of a kitchen i nearly died she said 
in her hometown of clayton ala at least we had a big barn 
to stay in but i told myself i made this big brag that i was 
going to pittsburgh so im not going back 
in the following 54 years mrs williams raised two children and 
a niece survived an unhappy marriage bought a home saved enough 
money to bring her mother a brother and two sisters out of alabama 
and helped unionize fellow seamstresses in a wholesale carpeting 
business 
blacks began leaving the south in large numbers for a variety of 
reasons according to joe trotter a carnegie mellon professor of 
history boll weevil infestation and flooding ravaged cotton crops 
at that time limiting the number of farm jobs available for 
blacks while restrictions on immigration during world war i 
increased the number of jobs in industrial northern states 
blacks could not vote in the south and many sought greater 
control over their lives in the north trotter said 
lynching was a real factor for some people it was the whole 
idea that life was precarious in the south he said 
the migration also marked an important turning point in black 
history he said 
previously movement often was into rural areas migration 
into urban industrial areas was something new in fact it 
reorganized the black community and created a national black 
community before it was pretty much a regional southern 
community trotter said 
it took about a year to collect materials for the exhibits some 
personal items were lent to the museum by people who made the 
change from rural to city life crew said 
the larger exhibit in washington includes a farm house from 
southern maryland a recreation of the interior of a segregated 
train car and the inside of a philadelphia row house 
i gave talks for about a year to people telling them what we 
were trying to do crew said it made a lot of people look back 
and see that this was not a singular experience for their relatives 
it was part of a larger story and it fits into a broader 
experience 
it also reminded people of the importance of saving everyday 
artifacts to tell the story of the american people

melisa morgan has taken control of her own 
show but she would be the first to say that shes not a onewoman 
band 
on her debut do me baby she cowrote and coproduced most 
of the material she did the same on five songs on her new album 
good love two singles from the album love changes her 
duet with kashif and if you can do it i can too are 
climbing the charts 
still she says i feel there are a lot of things around me 
that i do handle and i have control over certain situations but 
im not in total control because i cant do it alone 
by cowriting and coproducing morgan feels she has more 
control over my creativity which is important in establishing a new 
artist and getting your sound across 
if someone is controlling your creativity then you feel 
limited and youre not letting all that you can be come out 
morgan said 
the result good love is a little more romantic than her 
last lp which turned out the hits do you still love me and 
do me baby 
i feel on this album whether i told a sad story or a happy 
story it was just more romantic she said 
on the last album i was definitely more rebellious as a 
writer not only professionally but just in the struggle of being 
in this business trying to get a deal and get people to listen to 
me now i dont think im as hungry as i am anxious im anxious to 
get to that next level to prove that i can handle that too 
inspiration came to the performer born joyce melisa morgan 
at a very young age as the youngest of three brothers and a 
sister she enjoyed singing along to the tunes on the stereo in her 
mothers living room in queens 
at age 9 she started singing with a gospel community choir the 
starlettes of corona the choir broke up when she was 13 
right then and there i realized i could either hang out with 
the girls and party every weekend or i could start auditioning for 
bands so thats what i decided to do morgan said 
she sang with local bands until her high school graduation at 
age 16 then she took on secretarial jobs during the day sang at 
night in small manhattan clubs and studied music theory at the 
juilliard school of music in new york 
in 1983 miss morgan toured with chaka khan she began to work 
with kashif singing on his albums and those of whitney houston and 
melba moore which he produced and signed with the same management 
company that had signed kashif hush productions 
she also began her continuing partnership with 
keyboardistcomposer lesette wilson hush productions had 
established writers but morgan thought that she and wilson could 
write better songs 
youre always a bit skeptical when theres some one brand new 
and you dont know what she can do said wayne edwards a capital 
records vice president she was signed through hush productions 
and hush was confident in her abilities if they feel that 
confident we said lets take a shot 
because lesette has had some experience already producing 
and our stuff songs was better thats how i got to write the 
majority of the material on my first album morgan said 
after the success of the first album it was natural that i 
write again for this one 
what surprised me was the fact that she could be in such 
control of her career at such an early age and have such a defined 
direction edwards said she walked in prepared i knew we had 
the goods 
now shes enjoying the fruits of her labor for the first time 
when she goes out on tour she will be the headliner 
i think ive had a lot of success and im very thankful for 
that but i think that theres just so much more im just anxious 
to get there sometimes i just have to lay back and be cool she

theres a special blend as potent as 
tennessee moonshine thats responsible for the 20year success of 
the syndicated country variety show hee haw 
the nashvilleproduced program ridiculed by national tv critics 
after its first broadcast has survived cancellation by cbs the 
loss of major cast members and the general decline of network 
variety shows 
in fact hee haw has outlasted every other variety show in 
television history surpassing the lawrence welk show in 
september with more than 1 billion viewers in two decades 
cast members who were with the show in the days when it was 
taped in a oneroom nashville news studio say it has exceeded all 
expectations because of its downhome country hospitality 
i dont think the public cares if we do the same thing over 
and over again said minnie pearl an original cast member i 
think theyre more interested in visiting with us 
the audience knows we like them said george lindsey a 
16year hee haw veteran who brought his popular goober 
character to the show when mayberry rfd was canceled they 
know that were their friends i think theyre almost doing it with 
us 
lindsey and miss pearl are featured with other cast members and 
fellow country music entertainers in a special twohour 20th 
anniversary tribute to the series to be broadcast between april 15 
and may 8 
other cast members appearing on the special include cathy baker 
marianne rogers misty rowe grandpa jones gailard sartain gordie 
tapp dub taylor and buck owens who left the show two years ago 
after 18 years as cohost 
featured guests include george jones conway twitty barbara 
mandrell kathy mattea charley pride kenny rogers ricky skaggs 
and highway 101 
the special taped before a live audience march 30 at the lazy e 
arena in guthrie gave original cast members and fellow country 
music artists a chance to catch up on each others lives 
its really like a family reunion said roy clark who has 
served as cohost of the show since its first broadcast we see 
how fat everybodys gotten and how many new babies there are 
during rehearsals for the show tanya tucker who first appeared 
on the program at age 14 got autographs from performers and cast 
members lorretta lynn who was featured on the first hee haw 
had pictures taken with many fellow artists and clark spent much 
of his time between stage calls exchanging stories with guests and 
cast members 
sam lovullo the programs producer since its pilot in 1969 
believes theres a simple reason hee haw has been successful 
the people on the show make it fun its got a little bit of 
everything for everybody in the audience 
there were no formalities and no tempers lost when taping the 
anniversary special despite the complexity of weaving 15 major 
country music acts into the programs basic format of hillbilly 
humor 
clark found time between sketches to rattle off jokes to the 
live audience or to coerce the band into joining him in a song to 
pass the time minnie pearl rushed to kiss a man in the audience 
after he complimented her performance in a sketch and ray stevens 
cast off problems with his song by stopping in midverse with a 
joke 
the concept for hee haw was developed by canadians john 
aylesworth and frank peppiatt who offered the series to cbs when 
their jonathan winters show was canceled in 1968 
cbs asked for a 12week pilot of the show to air in the summer 
of 1969 and incorporated it in its regular season lineup in 1970 
but the network canceled hee haw and several other toprated 
countryoriented programs in 1971 to make room for shows aimed at a 
younger urban audience 
six months later hee haw went into syndication and its 26 
shows a year are now carried by 220 stations 135 of which are cbs 
affiliates 
aylesworth and peppiatt developed the shows concept after 
noting the success of rowan and martins laughin and realizing 
the potential for a variety show spotlighting country music and 
comedy 
we figured it had a pretty good chance said aylesworth who 
left the show in 1981 after a subsidiary of oklahoma citybased 
gaylord broadcasting co acquired the programs original production 
company we just put it together just shooting from the hip 
that carefree and casual style has been the shows trademark 
its not unusual to see foiled comedy sketches in the weekly 
broadcast in fact much of the 20 minutes of old footage included 
in the anniversary special features onair blunders that have been 
praised by fans as some of the shows funniest material 
thats the thing that has kept this show on for 20 years 
said barry adelman a writer for the show for 10 years comedy 
has made the difference a lot of other country music shows started 
at the same time hee haw did but hee haw is the only one 
left 
youve got to admit its got to be the most different and 
unusual show on television said owens who teamed up with clark 
in several sketches for the special 
a bunch of fat old men and pretty young girls thats what 
its all about

introducing youngsters to the marvels of plant life is one of 
the educational benefits of a childrens garden which also 
stimulates a sense of wonder and a respect for living things 
thats the view of the brooklyn botanic garden where for 74 
years more than 15000 children have cultivated the same patch of 
city land in the worlds oldest continuous program of its kind 
the success of the crops is only one of the rewards the 
children reap says betsy jacobs the gardens associate director 
of education childrens programs of equal importance are the 
lessons they learn selfdiscipline firsthand experience 
dignity of labor generosity respect for the rights and property 
of others respect for the environment responsibility and giving 
of ones self 
gardening is an acceptable way for youngsters to get dirt under 
their fingernails and learn something valuable they will hold dear 
for the rest of their lives even the difficult child can respond 
with innocent wonderment to the miracle of growing things 
how do parents or teachers involve youngsters in home gardening 
here are some suggestions from specialists 
start small 5 square feet is a large responsibility for a 
child begin with seeds because if you buy plants your child will 
miss out on the cycle of seeds soil sun and water the best way 
for a child to learn is by watching so keep the coaching to a 
minimum let them watch you for a while before you turn them loose 
to plant 
never water or care for the plants yourself except when 
helping very young children dont lay a guilt trip on the child if 
flowers or vegetables die of neglect say nothing the child 
learned a lesson that may stick 
put a low wire edging around the childs garden which may be 
a separate area in the home garden or a bit of separate land the 
wire is intended to keep out siblings household pets and adult 
feet it also gives the child a sense of ownership let your young 
gardener pull up some flowers if he or she wants to and to make 
bouquets in vases or foillined cans 
a simple device to help children water plants is a roller 
paint tray with holes perforated with a nail plant seeds in rows 
parallel to the tray about 6 inches away the tray can be filled 
with a small bucket and will act as a reservoir a water hose in 
the hands of a little one tends to wash away seeds and knock over 
seedlings and soak the child 
manure water or a weak solution of fertilizer can be used 
occasionally to demonstrate that plants can benefit from extra 
feedings explain what plant foods do for flowers and vegetables 
let the child be a part of the process of selecting what to 
plant but remember that ease and dependability are big factors 
it would be difficult to find an easiertogrow more dependable 
and spectacular plant than annual sunflowers children will get a 
kick out of growing such enormous plants the seeds are easy to 
handle and quick to sprout few insects bother sunflowers beans 
and summer squash seeds also are easy to handle 
climbing vines such as morning glories also make good first 
flowers but you should string these plants up a fence or sturdy 
pole easy flower varieties include marigolds zinnias and cosmos 
another idea is to buy mixtures of flower seeds readymade for 
children some are sold as annual flower mixture cutflower 
mixture or wildflower mixture any of these can produce 
beautiful species and curiosities these mixtures thrive even if 
not thinned much fed or watered for a while 
the idea is to get the childs attention and hold interest with 
projects that get quick or spectacular results 
first show children the dry or sleeping seeds and how they 
wake up when moistened or planted line the inside of a clear 
glass or jar with seeds a few inches apart put a lid on leave the 
jar on a kitchen counter making sure the towel remains wet in a 
few days seeds will swell and burst open roots will grow down 
while stems and leaves grow up

the brooklyn botanic garden whose childrens garden was 
initiated in 1914 says it has never produced a satisfactory answer 
to the radish question explaining 
every year there has been a saturday in late april when 
packets of seeds are given to several hundred city children the 
soil is carefully worked and the seeds dropped into rows according 
to arrangements meticulously worked out on graph paper during 
classroom sessions weeks before 
the first harvest comes in about six weeks the first harvest 
inevitably is radishes the child never having produced a miracle 
before bears them home in triumph 
then comes for a mother the supreme test of her nurturing 
ability how do you respond to this peculiar prize without 
diminishing the young gardeners enthusiasm and selfesteem 
the lettuce and tomatoes are still weeks and months away 
respectively so you cant make a salad to fry a radish is out of 
the question a little bit may punch up a casserole but theres no 
way it can be a main ingredient the child wants everyone to make a 
meal of the first crop which is indeed a miracle given the 
circumstances 
whats a mother to do 
it is estimated that each child on a certain saturday in 
june takes home an average of 73 radishes as this has been 
happening since 1914 it means that the heroic mothers or brooklyn 
and other new york city boroughs have had as many as 2 million 
radishes to deal with

theres no guarantee that youll break any giant vegetable 
growing records such as the 671pound pumpkin and 5955pound 
squash but you can try 
here are a few suggestions to help you on your way to fame fun 
and not much fortune 
the record pumpkin 12feet11inches in circumference won top 
prizes at 1986 world pumpkin confederation weighoffs for robert 
gancarz a jacobstown nj vegetable farmer the squash was grown 
by his brother edward 
the previous record pumpkin grown in 1984 at chelan wash 
weighed 612 pounds and the top squash had been 513 pounds 
at the competition in collins ny it took 12 men to move the 
giant pumpkins from a forklift to a truck scale the pumpkins were 
so big and heavy that they grew flat on one side and each ridge was 
wider than a mans foot 
the first step in growing a giant vegetable says a michigan 
state university horticulturist is to pick a giant variety in 
buying seeds major seed companies often offer a number of large 
varieties 
when it comes to big vegetables the secret really is genetic 
if you plant seeds of ordinarysize vegetables no matter how much 
fertilizer water sunlight and care you provide youll still have 
ordinarysize vegetables but if you plant seed for giants and 
provide all those growing aids youd better have a lot of growing 
and storage space 
for instance atlantic giant pumpkin seed produces fruit big 
enough to hold a person and the variety has weighed in at 4955 
pounds big max seed often produces 100150 pounders 
for giant winter squash try hungarian mammoth or mammoth king 
which may tip the scale at 400 pounds not unusual at 250 pounds 
an edible huge squash is pink banana 3 feet long and 8 inches in 
diameter weighing 5060 pounds 
give your plants a head start to gain big size by planting the 
seeds very early indoors in large containers you want sixweekold 
transplant to put into the garden after the soil warms in spring 
prepare the garden area as soon as you can work the soil a high 
spot has better drainage and a longer growing season than a low 
place where cold air collects and frost comes early 
remember that a giant squash vine will be 30 to 40 feet long so 
plant where it will be out of the way give plants about 10 square 
feet in which to straggle bushtype pumpkins and squash are being 
developed 
after you work the soil add fertilizer at the rate recommended 
for general vegetable gardening and cover with black plastic mulch 
to warm the soil the mulch also helps minimize the shock of 
transplanting discourages weed growth and conserves moisture 
set the plants in the ground through slits in the plastic mulch 
as early as feasible being careful not to damage roots shield 
plants against cold with a hot cap or other covering removing the 
cover in the morning to protect it from the suns baking heat 
pick all female flowers until the vine is about 8 feet long the 
female flowers are those with miniature fruit at the stem end the 
others are male this will give the vine growth needed to support 
big fruit let the second or third female flower set fruit and pick 
off all other female flowers that follow as soon as they appear 
examine the vine and pick flowers at least three times a week 
to keep vines healthy an insect and disease control program and 
weekly watering in dry periods are necessary extra fertilizer 
isnt necessary unless obvious nutrient problems appear 
to improve the shape of your giant vegetables roll the fruit a 
quarter of a turn every week or 10 days you can do this however 
only while the fruit is small and the stem is not yet woody after 
this rolling fruit is apt to break it from the vine 
for maximum size let your pumpkin squash watermelon or other 
giant vegetables grow until the vine is dead or at least nearly dry

for a shaded spot in the garden on the patio window box or 
hanging basket the exquisite tuberous begonia will bring brightly 
colored flowers often 5 to 6 inches across 
begonia tuberhybrida produces spectacular blooms just right for 
terraces drooping or pendulous varieties are known as hanging 
basket types but flowers are smaller and more numerous 
getting a good head start indoors in spring is the secret of 
getting a seasonlong display outdoors 
the tubers generally are priced according to size but you dont 
have to have the biggest tubers to get the best results buy firm 
tubers soft ones indicate rot 
if sprouting eyes are not visible put the tubers on a mixture 
of peat moss and sand in equal parts and water them cover the 
tubers with sphagnum peat moisten it and keep the pot with one or 
two tubers or the flat in 70degree temperature in two weeks or 
so tiny pinkish eyes should appear 
plant the tubers inverted side up in regular potting soil or a 
mix of sand peat or perlite and garden loam one third each 
begonias need a welldrained medium and lots of moisture 
in planting tuberous begonias in individual pots set the top of 
the tuber with the sprouting eyes an inch or two below the surface 
a fairly wide pot is recommended since roots form around the sides 
of the tuber and spread outward begonias are shallowrooted so the 
pot need not be very deep a pot 78 inches across is adequate for 
one tuber 
for good growth indoors set pots in a sunny window or 
supplement with artificial light 1216 hours a day poor light 
means elongated and spindly steams because begonias are heavy 
feeders fertilize every two weeks with liquid nutrients at 
recommended rates 
after frost danger ends set plants outdoors directly into the 
ground or sink their pots in welldrained soil avoid soggy 
conditions 
it will be helpful to set stakes such as 2foot tall slender 
bamboo poles beside each growing stalk when the plants are set 
out large flowers will need support stalks may break otherwise on 
windy or rainy days 
a light mulch of peat moss on the soil around begonias will 
conserve moisture feed regularly to encourage good flower 
production throughout summer 
begonia flowers red white pink yellow or bicolored picotte 
have been called mimics of the plant world because they resemble 
roses camellias and carnations but are odorless 
putting potted plants in wire baskets lined with sphagnum moss 
will conserve moisture 
lift begonias from the garden or containers before heavy frost 
and let them cure in a cool place in perlite or peat or in the same 
pot for replanting next season

soils must do more than provide a home for plant roots they 
must also supply nutrients for growth such as nitrogen phosphorus 
and potasium plus micronutrients including copper zinc 
manganese iron and molybdenum 
garden fertilizers thus are a fine investment when you know the 
correct elements and quantities to apply 
in their natural state soils rarely contain enough nutrients 
for the best growth of plants generally it is necessary to 
supplement the earths store of plant nutrients for the most 
vigorous lawn abundant flowers or the greatest yield of tasty and 
nutritious vegetables plants use large amounts of nitrogen 
phosphorus and potassium so these nutrients are most likely to be 
deficient in the soil 
the best way to know what fertilizer is needed is a soil test 
your county cooperative extension service can help with this 
soil experts advise that it is usually wasteful perhaps even 
harmful to use the wrong fertilizers a soil test allows you to 
give your plants what they need in the most useful proportions 
how can you tell the proportion of each element in a fertilizer 
from the numbers on the bag a mixture labeled 5105 for 
instance contains 5 percent total nitrogen 10 percent available 
phosphoric oxide and 5 percent soluble potash 
most ordinary farm fertilizers are granulated or pelleted 
material some may be available in powdered or concentrated forms 
powdered types may not be desirable because they are too dusty 
however fertilizer concentrates in liquid form are readily 
available to the plants and can be applied to the foliage if 
diluted 100 times by volume with water 
organic fertilizers also help what are they they are any 
biodegradable refuse such as animal manure compost leaves weeds 
straw sawdust wood chips garbage even paper while organic 
matter is an excellent ingredient it has a low plant nutrition 
content and a large amount is needed to correct a soil nutrient 
deficiency 
fertilizer application is only one step in effective soil 
management for best growth lawns vegetable and ornamentals also 
need suitable soil acidity soil structure and moisture

gardeners know nature is forgiving when their flowers and 
vegetables flourish despite their errors yet theres one gardening 
mistake nature wont forgive watering plants too little or too 
much 
theres nothing more important to plants than water says 
gardening authority dorrie sillman the main daytoday problem 
facing gardeners is delivering the right amount of water to the 
soil 
seeds will not germinate without water she says without it a 
plants biological processes cease water also gives plants their 
shape and stiffness nutrients must dissolve in water before plants 
can use them at the same time a plant cannot obtain sufficient 
nutrients in waterlogged soil 
in her garden in holland pa miss sillman tests power tools 
including a tiller portable sprayer and chipper designed to 
assist suburban gardeners with their yearround chores 
irregular insufficient watering is the biggest mistake 
particularly during hot dry summer weather she says you must 
provide enough water to penetrate the soil to the level of a 
plants roots surface water will evaporate in the heat of the 
sun 
miss sillman who counsels users of mantis manufacturing co 
equipment on planting and maintaining smallplot gardens offers 
these tips 
how to tell if soil requires water pick up a handful of 
topsoil and squeeze it into a ball the soil has sufficient 
moisture if the ball holds its shape if the ball crumbles easily 
the soil needs water ideally water when half the moisture the 
soil can hold has dried out 
how much water the soil needs water should soak into the soil 
at least 6 inches to a foot deep to reach plant roots in general 
this means applying about an inch of water over the entire area of 
your garden the lighter more sandy your soil the deeper this 
amount of water will penetrate mere surface sprinkling encourages 
shallow roots which are vulnerable to scorching in the hot sun 
how to water the soil early in the season when plant root 
systems have not developed hand watering will not take much time 
with a hose spray attachment that breaks the force of water its 
healthier for the delicate plants too 
as root systems develop however you will need to find a more 
efficient way to distribute water 
sprinklers attached to hoses or sprinkler hoses perforated 
plastic hoses will provide a constant even supply of water to your 
garden from above the soil you can place a tin can with a 1inch 
mark from its bottom in the path of a sprinkler to easily tell when 
the sprinkler has delivered sufficient water to penetrate the soil 
to the right depth 
how often to water soil conditions weather the kinds of 
plants you grow affect the frequency of watering vegetables in 
general need twice as much water as flowers newly planted trees 
and shrubs require frequent watering especially in dry weather 
plants sheltered by walls or hedges may need watering even after a 
rainstorm but they will not dry out as fast as plants in the open 
plants high on a slope will dry out faster than those at the 
bottom plants growing in light sandy soil need water more often 
than those growing in heavier soil 
a good rule of thumb make sure your garden gets 1 inch of water 
per week throughout the growing season

a compost pile is a beneficial way to dispose of household 
refuse crop residue and autumn leaves while producing your own 
supply of organic matter for the garden 
almost any family can develop a compost pile that also offers 
environmental advantages starting and maintaining a compost pile 
is not complicated there are special attractive sophisticated 
bins made for this purpose but really all you need is a bottomless 
receptacle of boards or chicken wire in which to collect material 
the size of the bin will depend on the size of your garden with 
an average dimension of about 6feetby6feet it can be hidden 
behind trees at the edge of the garden or near an outbuilding 
my compost bin is fashioned of heavy wire with six sides which 
help support tomato plants that are fed nutrients by the piles 
contents 
rather than adding to a communitys waste disposal burden 
composted refuse becomes a valuable fertilizer and soil 
conditioner apply it to the garden at a rate of at least a pailful 
to the square yard each year mix the compost thoroughly with the 
topsoil to a depth of 6 to 10 inches or apply it as a ulch on the 
soil surface 
a major garden problem is poor soil not so much the fertility 
but the structure compacted loam sandy and clay soils discourage 
plant growth even when fertilizer is added compacted soils lock up 
nutrients sandy soils leach away clay soils restrict freedom of 
root growth 
the most effective remedy in such a situation is compost with 
its fibrous structure and pockets of air allowing plant roots 
freedom to breathe 
compost not only improves soil texture it adds beneficial 
microorganisms that manufacture plant nutrients and help fight 
soil diseases 
frequent questions about compost and answers 
does compost have any value as a fertilizer 
yes if it is made from materials that contain essential plant 
nutrients animal manures and green wastes such as grass clippings 
and green leaves are a source of nitrogen bone meal and rock 
phosphate are a source of phosphorus and wood ashes in limited 
quantities are an excellent source of potash compost also 
conditions the soil improves the moistureholding capacity of 
sandy soils and breaks up sticky cold clay soils 
what materials are best for composting 
from the house fruit and vegetable peelings shredded 
newspapers eggshells coffee grounds tea bags wood ashes cotton 
and wool rags from the garden grass clippings hedge trimmings 
weeds shredded leaves animal manures including poultry leaves 
and fibrous weed roots are best shredded with a lawn mower to speed 
decomposition 
how long does it take to make compost 
that depends on the method used and time of year warm 
temperatures hasten decomposition with a compost bin which 
prevents waste materials from drying out or becoming waterlogged 
its possible to have useful compost within six weeks 
do compost heaps need turning 
with an exposed compost pile the sides have a tendency to dry 
out and so turning the heap will ensure thorough decomposition 
turning an exposed heap also aids aeration with an enclosed bin 
ventilation from below and along the sides provides adequate 
aeration without the need for turning also the protection 
provided by a bin extends fermentation to all areas of the heap 
can compost feed lawns 
yes and the time to apply it is in fall spread it evenly over 
lawn areas and during winter the compost will work its way into the 
existing soil by spring it will be all gone absorbed into the 
upper soil surface helping the grass to grow thick and healthy

in most parts of this country september is a good time to plant 
evergreen trees to enhance the landscape but which varieties best 
suit your purposes 
first make up your mind what should be their ultimate height 
and general shape then study your catalogs or visit your favorite 
nursery 
if you want a large tree consider the pines spruces and firs 
these include the white red and scotch pines all making 
broadheaded trees eventually among the spruces the colorado blue 
is familiar and beautiful and the norway is popular also well 
known are the white black hills and englemann especially in the 
west spruces among the first consider the bluetinted white fir 
the whitishbarked arizona fir and the douglas fir the latter not 
a true fir soft and graceful are the hemlocks both eastern and 
western 
for trees of moderatesize and less spreading there are red 
cedars often called junipers for dry places arborvitae for wet 
areas and plume cypress retinosporas often used in foundation 
plantings the red cedars and arborvitae come in various forms and 
color tones such as rocky mountain juniper the plume cypress 
offers large variety fan foliage plume feathery and threadlike 
all three species grow quite tall to 30 feet or more in time 
rarer varieties are the japanese cryptomeria and the umbrella 
pine or sciadoptiys both fairly narrow trees even narrower are 
the irish columnar chinese italian or arizona junipers 
for hedges yews are excellent and for low flat forms there are 
spreading junipers of a number of kinds 
all of these may be planted in early and midfall prepare the 
soil well dig holes two to three times the size of the root ball 
the soil to go around the roots should be made waterretentive by 
adding 1020 percent peat and fertilized with half as much dried 
cow manure before shoveling the mixture in wait until growth

dont worry about your plants if you are going on a short 
vacation say four to five days or a week 
set a group of plants on thoroughly soaked bath towels in the 
bathtub kitchen sink or laundry tub exposed to some light but 
not direct sunlight then open the water faucet so that one drop of 
water falls every few seconds on the towels leave the drain 
open the towels will conduct the moisture to the plants soil 
keeping plants in good condition until you get home 
if you have leftover vegetable and flower seeds and want to 
store them for next season keep them cool and dry store them in 
tightly closed glass jars in a cool dark place such as a dry 
basement or garage under these conditions they should keep well 
and germinate when you plant them next spring 
if your african violets appear a bit sickly examine them for 
small white specks on the leaves and stems these probably are 
scale insects or mealybugs that suck the juice from the plants 
they eventually will kill the plants if not stopped 
most garden shops have specially prepared sprays for delicate 
plants such as the african violet

air light space soil water work and greater 
or lesser amounts of money these basics for gardening have their 
own dimensions in cities 
take air and pollution perhaps its not as bad as one might 
think experts say wind carries some of it away and nowadays 
industries are often located in industrial parks outside towns the 
rooftop gardener may have another air problem though too much 
wind a bit of fencing or a windbreak of bushes can help this 
situation 
light can be quirky in the city apartment windows terraces 
patios backyards and rooftop gardens hemmed in by tall buildings 
may get most of their light from only one direction or little 
light at all except in midsummer when the sun is most directly 
overhead 
but if the sun does strike one section of a terrace or walled 
garden white paint or reflecting material on that area will pitch 
the light to the opposite side 
in the case of little light the city gardener will have to 
settle for shadeloving plants but he can still have a green sea 
of ferns myrtle ajuga and hosta lilies and colorful caladiums 
impatiens begonias astilbe bulbs and the like with ivy draping 
his walls 
in rooftop gardens meanwhile the sun may blaze down again 
the key to success is choosing the right plants zinnias and 
tomatoes will love that sun 
garden books seed catalogs nurserymen and garden stores can 
help one choose suitable plants 
precious space in the city can be stretched plants can be hung 
from walls and ceilings and placed on shelves tomatoes cucumbers 
and other vining vegetables can be grown upward instead of outward 
most city gardening is done in containers what soil should one 
use 
many experts advise against soil dug up from a country friends 
garden soils become compacted more easily in limited space and may 
not drain well 
some suggest mixtures for instance equal parts of commercial 
potting mix compost or vermiculite and common garden soil or two 
parts of compost and one part of garden soil with enough builders 
sand or vermiculite added to give the mixture a gritty feeling 
some favor a soilless mix 
many gardeners agree that theres no set rule for watering 
plants except not to let them get too dry or too wet and that one 
thorough watering is better than several shallow ones different 
plants have different water needs but a rule of thumb for many 
plants might be if the soil is dry to a depth of one inch water 
it poke a finger into the soil to find out rooftop gardens may 
need extra waterings 
one way to water indoor plants thoroughly is to soak the 
containers in a few inches of water in a bathtub 
just about anything will do for a container it seems plastic 
tubs and wastepaper baskets bushel baskets old wine cases and the 
like just be sure they have drainage holes very near the bottom of 
the container or one can pay big bucks for terra cotta redwood 
and decorative stone containers or make ones own window boxes 
seed is an inexpensive way to start plants but it takes time 
and work to grow it and the conditions may not be right in that 
case buying plants may be the best bet

rosemary stands for constancy and remembrance 
as ophelia recalled in hamlet 
the ancient greeks used thyme as a temple incense and it is 
prized today as a honey plant 
fennel in literature and legend is a symbol of flattery a 
remedy for failing eyesight and an aphrodisiac 
to many of us these and other herbs with equally intriguing 
backgrounds are just those small containers of dried stuff on the 
spice rack in the kitchen and yet they had to grow somewhere why 
not in ones own garden or on the window sill 
herbs are not difficult to cultivate take up little room can 
be grown indoors or out in natural sunlight or under artificial 
light they are decorative and smell good as well as being edible 
both fresh and dried relatively low in sodium theyre touted 
these days as a way to give pizazz to saltfree or lowsalt diets 
and theres the satisfaction of having produced something oneself 
some herbs are wellknown basil marjoram oregano thyme 
parsley somewhat less known perhaps are dill and fennel savory 
chervil horsemint tarragon catnip is an herb cat owners take 
note 
one of the largest families of herbs is basil holy basil it 
smells like cloves lemon cinnamon and licorice basils smelling 
like what their names suggest purple ruffles basil and ball 
basil as well as what we generally eat as plain basil 
not all herbs are used for eating some are dried and used as 
air fresheners and sachets for drawers and closets lavender and 
lemon balm for instance some are used in dried bouquets 
ambrosia and artemesia some as decorative garden plants catmint 
with its aromatic silver foliage and lavenderblue flowers 
tricolor sage with violet flowers and leaves marked in red green 
and white gold edge thyme 
most herbs like lots of sun basil is an exception liking only 
moderate amounts thalassa cruso in making vegetables grow 
says herbs have the strongest flavor if grown in rather sweet soil 
in the case of acid soil add ground limestone some herbs are so 
low theyre used as ground covers some can grow two or more feet 
high 
herbs can be mixed with the flowers in a garden used as borders 
for flower beds planted on the fringes of vegetable plots given a 
garden patch all their own grown indoors on a window sill or on 
shelves with fluorescent light the ambitious gardener can create 
an elaborate decorative knot of herbs as was popular in 
elizabethan times 
some herbs are perennial some annual most can be grown from 
seed but in the case of some slow growers rosemary for instance 
buying plants is often recommended 
many botanic gardens and other public gardens have areas devoted 
to herbs where one can get ideas 
as for using herbs there are recipes and ideas galore in 
newspapers books and magazines

at the shepherd spinal center in atlanta spinalinjured 
patients develop gardening skills in garden beds specially designed 
for wheelchairs 
at the perkins school for the blind in watertown mass the 
visually impaired get the same sense of accomplishment physical 
exercise and selfreliance in growing their own food as any other 
gardener their planting can be done with pelleted seed seed tape 
or selfwrapped seeds 
its all part of an apparently growing interest in horticulture 
as therapy for the mentally and physically disabled senior 
citizens and other people with special needs more than 23000 such 
people are served daily by members of the american horticultural 
therapy association which was formed in 1973 
working with plants is a form of therapy at about 300 hospitals 
the ahta says 
the institute for rehabilitation medicine at new york university 
medical center opened a horticultural therapy greenhouse in 1959 
for victims of strokes and other physical disabilities and 
horticultural therapy is a program at the florida alcohol treatment 
center 
at the university of nebraska medical center gardening is part 
of the therapy for older patients 
many nursing home residents many from farm backgrounds know 
more about plant care than some of their caretakers says elaine 
matthis of elkhorn neb who works with the elderly at the center 
the problem with older adults is that sometimes there is a 
sense of lost productivity so maybe they cant work behind a 
tiller but they may be able to work with container gardening or at 
a raised garden she says for people getting confused who 
need to resolve feelings of the past who need to reminisce its 
important to facilitate their thinking of the past

how does your garden grow 
not with silver bells and cockle shells despite the nursery 
rhyme 
it takes knowhow to be a successful gardener and correcting 
common misconceptions can make the difference according to plant 
care experts jack peters and jim knauss 
the amateur gardener can increase the health potential of plants 
throughout the year by knowing more about ageold assumptions that 
arent necessarily so they say 
in most of these cases the amateur gardener tends to err on 
the side of excess says knauss who is manager of technical and 
analytical information services at wr grace amp cos peter plants 
food division the healthiest plants are those that have the 
benefit of simple consistent attention 
one misconception he says is to always keep the soil surface 
moist a common practice says knauss but one that can keep 
plants and gardens from getting the air they need the telltale 
area is deeper within the soil before bringing out the watering 
can put a finger about 12 inches beneath the soil to test the 
dryness when watering the liquid should go far beyond just 
the surface making sure the roots are fully moistened 
another common idea to reassess is that selecting plants with 
the lushest greenest foliage at the garden center will ensure easy 
care survival says peters producer manager for peters plant food 
people tend to feel that a lush healthy plant will remain 
that way with a minimum of care and attention he says what 
they dont see is the extent of the care that plant had been 
receiving at the greenhouse or nursery that particular plant may 
despite its looks be quite difficult to maintain and keep healthy 
knowing about the variety and maintaining consistent 
environments are the important determinants of long plant health 
not simply the original plants appearance

gardeners who wear broadbrimmed hats coveralls and heavyduty 
gloves while using an electric hedge clipper to trim bushes are 
displaying common sense but not enough of it says the american 
optometric association 
the garb protects the face from the sun and clothing and hands 
from the wear and tear of yard work but the eyes are left exposed 
and vulnerable to flying twigs leaves and other debris 
nearly 3400 americans suffer eye injuries from lawnmowers and 
home gardening equipment each year according to the industry trade 
group which says most of the injuries could be prevented by the 
use of proper safety eyewear 
the optometrists warn that lawnmowers other cutting tools and 
garden chemicals can turn a seemingly harmless pastime into a 
visionendangering activity one in which regular eyeglasses or 
contact lenses do not provide enough protection 
by federal regulation eyeglasses are impactresistant but they 
still can be shattered by rocks or twigs thrown by power tools and 
spray or dust from weed killers and fertilizers can get around them 
inexpensive plastic safety goggles some of which even fit over 
regular eyeglasses will meet most home gardeners eye safety 
needs according to the association which also notes that 
protection from the suns harmful rays and clear comflettuce new zealand 
spinach and a variety of 
herbs are suggestions

a coldframe can extend your gardening efforts both in early 
spring and in fall it is useful to condition young seedlings that 
were sown indoors for later planting outdoors 
a coldframe can be built as a leanto against the house by 
covering the frame with a storm sash or a similar type of window 
the framework of the bed can be made of wood or concrete for wood 
the boards should be 2 inches thick 
the front of the frame should face south and should be at least 
2 inches below ground level the back portion of the frame should 
be 6 inches higher than the front with a slope of about 1 inch per 
foot bank up the soil on the outside of the frame to help conserve 
heat 
during spring and fall when the frame is in use lift the sash 
on warm days but be sure to close it on cool nights to conserve 
moisture and heat inside

house plants usually do most of their growing during the long 
days of summer so late winter or early spring is generally a good 
time to repot those that have outgrown their containers 
the best way to tell whether plants are rootbound is to tip 
them out of their pots and examine the rootballs if the ball of 
soil is a mass of roots with little soil visible its time for a 
new pot 
in extreme cases plants may push themselves right up out of 
their containers repot in fresh soil in the next larger sized pot 
plants that have been doing poorly should perk up under the 
combined influenced of increased light and more root space

a top ibm executive has confirmed that the 
company has offered its stateoftheart computer chips for sale to 
other companies according to a report published today 
ibms vice chairman and highestranking engineer jack d 
kuehler denied industry speculation that the company was acting to 
prevent its american competitors from becoming dependent on 
japanese suppliers for chips the new york times reported 
the chip is the core technology in advanced computers 
kuehler acknowledged that for more than two years the company 
has offered small supplies of advanced chips to fewer than a dozen 
american and european computer makers the company did so to 
sharpen our own competitiveness by letting other computer makers 
choose between ibms chips and those offered by japanese companies 
he said 
sometimes we found we were deficient and we have worked to 
correct that he said sometimes we found we were truly 
leaders 
but the times reported that other industry officials suspected 
that international business machines had other motives in acting as 
a chip supplier to competitors such as driving down its own 
production costs 
ibm is in the unusual position of having to worry about the 
global competitiveness of american chip technology said richard 
shaffer editor of the technologic computer letter which follows 
the computer and semiconductor industries 
ibm officials have said the companys own health depends on 
maintaining a strong domestic ability to produce chips train a 
large number of microelectronic engineers and sustain a strong 
semiconductor equipment manufacturing business so ibm will not need 
to depend on japan for the most uptodate technology 
reports that ibm offered to sell chips to an archrival digital 
equipment corporation surfaced about 10 days ago and industry 
sources then revealed the offers were more widespread 
the company also has said it was selling only its chips not its 
underlying designs or process technology

government reports on prospective spring plantings and grain 
stocks sent soybean contracts to new highs and encouraged traders 
to hedge by buying corn and beans while selling wheat analysts 
said 
the agriculture departments annual report on farmers spring 
planting intentions released thursday predicted about a 1 percent 
increase in soybean acreage to 579 million acres that figure was 
well below the average prereport estimate of 591 million acres

almost 115 billion bushels as of march 1 slightly below the 
prereport estimate 
the reports showed corn planting intentions at 669 million 
acres up 2 percent from last year but slightly below expectations 
that figure was offset by the corn stocks estimate of 76 billion 
bushels slightly above estimates

corn the stocks figure was bearish and the acreage figure was 
bullish said victor lespinasse an analyst with dean witter 
reynolds inc

a top expert in the race to develop 
hightemperature superconductors said today he has rejected efforts 
to lure him to the university of california berkeley and will 
stay at the university of houston 
this has been one of the most diffhcult decisions in my life 
the offer from the university of california berkeley was 
excellent and had me torn between my loyalty to uh and a desire to 
be at berkeley as it has been a personal goal to join the berkeley 
faculty scientist paul cw chu said in a statement 
yet developing the superconductivity effort at uh is a great 
responsibility with the enthusiastic support i have received 
at uh i should be able to achieve my professional goals he 
added 
chu called p buford price the chairman of the ucberkeley 
physics department on friday the deadline for his response and 
said he would stay in texas 
chu left no uncertainty that he was rejecting the berkeley 
offer price said no further action would be taken to recruit 
chu he said 
chus decision was reported over the weekend by the los angeles 
times and the houston post 
chu has built up a group there in houston and he feels 
responsible to them said ucberkeley physicist marvin l cohen 
who first urged uc officials to recruit his friend the program 
is coming along at a resounding clip 
the houston scientist reportedly was concerned that if he moved 
to berkeley he would abandon people who have supported him for a 
decade 
superconductors transmit electricity without resistance 
researchers are trying to develop materials that are 
superconducting at room temperature existing superconductors work 
only at extreme subfreezing temperatures although chu and other 
scientists have been discovering substances that work at 
progressively warmer temperatures 
scientists believe hightemperature superconductors may 
revolutionize electrical transmission computers trains motors 
and many other electrical devices 
cohen said much of the financing for superconductivity research 
at the university of houston was being provided because of chus 
presence 
the university pays chu a ninemonth teaching salary of 
150000 with an option to earn another 50000 by working 
summers a uc spokesman said senior professors at berkeley usually 
earn half that amount although the school didnt disclose its 
offer to chu 
cohen said chu may also have considered the career of his wife 
may chu who is now vice president of a houston bank 
officials at berkeley wooed the reticent chu in recent months 
with an offer of a combined teachingresearch position

the ingredients that have created the 
13pound wheel of cheese brian bailey thumps with his thumb include 
the weakening us dollar americas trade imbalance and of 
course carefully selected milk 
the maker of the cheese steuben foods inc believes the 
combination is going to make the europeanstyle cheese a big hit 
with american consumers who are buying more cheese than ever 
we believe we have a lot of things going for us said ken 
schlossberg president of steuben foods a subsidiary of the giant 
new york citybased elmhurst dairy corp this is where we think 
the next opportunity in the dairy business is 
here are the reasons for his optimism 
americans are looking to buy more unusual cheese the kind 
consumers find in gourmet sections of local supermarkets but much 
of that cheese is imported from europe 
and although it is not widely known the united states has 
strict import quotas on the amount of cheese that can be brought 
into this country allowing only 240 million pounds a year 
american cheese makers produced 53 billion pounds of cheese 
last year 
its about as restrictive a policy as you can imagine said 
richard koby counsel for the new yorkbased cheese importers 
association of america i dont think anyone could say how much 
cheese would come in if there were no quotas 
the dollars value has weakened against other major world 
currencies which means some imported products have become more 
expensive while the dollars strength is often talked about in 
terms of the price of automobiles or stereo equipment it also has 
an impact on the cheese business 
i dont want to say were economic geniuses but three years 
ago we thought the dollar was pretty high and it could only go one 
way and thats come to pass and were now starting to see some real 
rising in the price of european products schlossberg said 
the weak dollar makes steubens cheeses called castleborg and 
saint rochelle more attractive when displayed next to the european 
or scandanavian cheeses 
the cheeses are made using the traditional knowhow of 
finlands largest cheese maker valio and finnish and danish 
equipment along with bacteria cultures flown in weekly from 
helsinki 
bailey learned finnish sat in saunas and brought back a pair of 
clogs and the knowledge of the master cheese makers of finland to 
supervise the production of about 16000 pounds of cheese a day 
during one visit they made me an honorary finn thats where 
you have to roast in the hot sauna and then run and jump into the 
icy baltic he said 
signs confirming the companys optimism for the new cheese are 
beginning to appear 
the castleborg cheese a sweet swisslike variety won the 
top award in the open competition at the us cheese makers 
association contest last fall even before it hit store shelves 
this spring both cheeses priced at 5 a pound will be available 
across the country 
what were hoping is to make consumers aware of the brand of 
cheese so they feel comfortable buying it weve found that when 
people go to buy this kind of cheese theyre very nervous and 
suspect about what theyre actually going to get schlossberg 
said 
ventures like steubens are becoming more and more common in the 
cheese industry which for a long time was like winemaking where 
foreign and american interests seldom hook up 
several european firms have bought cheese factories in wisconsin 
and other states to make their products in the us for a number of 
reasons including freshness the currency and quota fluctuations 
said james tillison executive director of the us cheese makers 
association in madison wis 
i dont think youre going to see a mad rush but i think the 
trend will certainly continue he said 
he said cheese sales in the united states have increased by more 
than 25 percent in the last four years and that one of the 
fastestgrowing segments is specialty cheese such as brie 
jarlsberg gouda edam and camembert 
by far the most popular cheeses consumed in this country are 
american and mozzarella accounting for nearly 80 percent of all 
the cheese produced in the united states tillison said 
wisconsin is by far the nations largest cheese maker followed 
by minnesota and new york 
its a shame but americans seem to buy and judge their cheese 
by how well it melts over macaroni or whether you can make pizza 
with it bailey said in finland they eat pieces of cheese for 
breakfast thats the way it should be 
bailey carefully selects the right milk from the 58000 gallons 
of milk that come into this small plant each day saving some for 
the cheese and routing the rest to the milk plant in new york or to 
steubens whitney yogurt plant near buffalo 
he can almost look at milk and know what kind of cow it comes 
from and when he taps parafincoated wheels of cheese he can 
fairly accurately predict the size and amount of eyes or 
holes in the cheese 
making such cheese with care and attention to detail is somewhat 
unusual in the united states where huge processing plants roll off 
millions of pounds of american mozzarrella and cheddar in 
assemblyline fashion 
schlossberg said steuben foods didnt want to follow in those 
footsteps as we looked into it we heard the same things that 
you hear about american wines that you couldnt produce good 
cheese in the us that theres something about europe its the 
milk its the who knows its the air he said 
needless to say we didnt buy that

when david jackson of new zealand packed up his 
rugby shirt display to bring to japan he tossed in a sweatshirt 
made from brightly colored scrap materials gathered from the shop 
floor 
unfortunately thats the one japanese retailers liked 
we did it as a joke he said now theyve ordered 2000 of 
them exactly the same as this one these were oneofakind 
items he said ruefully i dont know how were going to be 
able to duplicate them 
it just goes to show you that you cant secondguess the 
japanese market we have to be ready to accept what the market 
tells us 
jackson was one of more than 200 exhibitors invited from 16 
countries to display their sports products at a recent trade fair 
with help from the japan external trade organization jetro 
the fair is one way the japanese government is trying to ease 
friction with other countries after piling up a trade surplus of 
827 billion in 1987 
japan and the united states for instance have argued over 
japanese restrictions on beef and citrus imports as well as 
american access to big japanese construction projects still there 
are areas in which japan is spending its own money to encourage 
imports 
masahiro suzuki assistant director of the jetro trade fair 
department said this the fifth such fair held since 1985 was 
an important means of showing foreign businessmen they can compete 
against japanese products 
the fair cost 200 million yen or about 16 million to produce 
and exhibitors were charged 1000 each which means the japanese 
government paid more than 5000 for each of the exhibits suzuki 
said 
newcomers dont know how to approach the japanese market we 
have to help them suzuki said 
other items featured at the fiveday fair included pool tables 
gliders surfboards automatic golf tees lawn bowling games 
crossbows skateboards and puzzles the japanese were particularly 
curious about the hog hair pork rind bait available at the 
california state booth the guide to 750 american golf courses and 
the 3700 electronic dart board set 
stefan schinzinger president of the san francisco hat company 
said he received three invitations from the japanese to attend this 
years trade show and he finally accepted he said it will take 
him months to sort out the business prospects the show produced 
schinzinger said he also had to make adjustments for the 
japanese markets one product was a sock with leather soles used by 
space shuttle astronauts to keep their feet warm 
the japanese dont use leather on their slippers they 
suggested it might sell better without the leather and be cheaper 
to make it just shows you cant forcefit an american product to 
the japanese market he said 
schinzinger praised the japanese government for taking steps to 
help foreign businessmen sell their products and said it was 
impossible to get help on trade matters from the american 
government 
my experience with the us government commercial office is 
that they are there to help the large multinational companies the 
service i get from the american government is nonexistent he 
said 
schinzinger said the fair on sports items was extremely popular 
because there is little competition from the japanese 
the japanese in the past havent had any leisure time they 
worked six days a week and spent one day at home with the family 
now theyre being encouraged to work a fiveday week and sports 
are becoming very popular 
now everyone is going at it with the typical enthusiasm of 
the japanese when they get into a sport they want all the 
knicknacks that go along with it 
those attending the show included the public retailers 
wholesalers and manufacturers 
schinzinger said many of the foreign participants were angered 
at the visits by japanese manufacturers 
we know were helping them develop new businesses 
schinzinger said they come to the show see whats popular and 
theyll make it themselves 
however he said participants were promised six months of 
product protection after the show during which time they will have 
an exclusive right to sell their products in japan 
thats enough time to file for a patent if you think your 
product will do well here he said 
however just to be sure he took out an 800 patent on his 
companys name before he left the united states

sooner or later pet economic theories become 
battered by events and must be recycled through academe before 
reappearing in altered form 
it is for this reason that several of the old economic models 
monetary keynesian and supply side among them are in for a 
periodic overhaul while a new one based mainly on recent 
experience is attracting attention 
perhaps most interesting at least from a popular view is that 
it offers an optimistic view of things at a time when some of the 
old models are flashing warnings lights and setting off sirens and 
bells 
edward yardeni of prudentialbache securities calls his version 
new wave economics basing it not on any lab theory of what the 
economy should be doing but simply on what it has been doing 
among its conclusions is this gem economywide recessions are 
unlikely to occur in the future more likely there will be rolling 
recessions limited to certain industries and sections of the 
country 
the viewpoint has a solid basis in recent and current economic 
matters it describes for example the very thing that has been 
occurring in the us economy over the past five years although 
disguised by traditional measures 
the traditional view is that the us economy has expanded 
steadily for five long years and that therefore it is becoming 
old weary and destined to fall into recession 
wait a minute say less traditional economists national figures 
do indeed show an uninterrupted expansion but national figures 
tend to hide what has happened in specific industries and regions 
within the nation 
the most obvious example of national figures disguising rather 
than revealing is how the boom in the northeast and in certain 
other areas badly warped the national numbers for nearly two years 
between 1985 and 1987 
while the massachusetts service economy couldnt be stopped in 
that time the industries and economies of 31 other states mainly 
those involved with or related to agriculture oil and other 
natural resources couldnt get started 
sindlinger amp co economic and marketing analysts repeatedly 
pointed this out consumer confidence payrolls spending and other 
measurements also suggested it 
the truth was always there in the official statistics most 
analysts however chose the national averages instead for one 
thing federal economic policy swings more on national rather than 
regional numbers 
but in yardenis opinion the bond market including a global 
market for us treasury securities is likely to be a more 
effective economic guide than federal reserve policy protecting 
the economy from booms that lead to busts 
it will react faster to dampen booms which suggests that the 
severe busts will no longer be necessary to unwind the excess 
caused by the booms excesses wont be allowed to build up in the 
first place 
if he and likethinkers are correct there may be regional 
recessions in the future as there was for almost two years between 
memorial day 1985 and and february 1987 but national recessions 
will be rarer 
in fact it might be argued that rather than facing a recession 
in the next year or so the us economy might already have put one 
behind it a regional recession that just didnt count in the 
national statistics

for housewives like kazuko higo beef is a delicacy 
she can afford only rarely almost as infrequently as her three 
grown sons come to visit she laments 
japanese beef is so expensive she said while doing her 
shopping at tokyos peacock supermarket i only cook it on 
occasions when my sons come to visit once every two weeks 
for shoppers at peacock japanese sirloin costs 450 yen per 100 
grams or 1636 a pound 
a similar australian cut sells for 1382 a pound american 
sirloin when it can be found retails at a relatively inexpensive 
745 a pound 
the staggering difference in price between the domestic and 
imported meat is behind the american demand that japan drop all 
import restrictions on beef citrus fruits and other agricultural 
products 
increased sales of us beef in japan could shrink the record 
598 billion us trade deficit with japan 
through a stringent quota system japan limits beef imports to 
protect its politically powerful farmers who support the ruling 
liberal democratic party they are currenty guaranteed 70 percent 
of the beef used locally the remaining 30 percent is imported 
highlevel talks between the two nations on terminating the 
import quotas ended in failure late thursday in washington as japan 
refused us demands japan has maintained it will only increase 
its quotas not drop them entirely 
japan nearly doubled its annual quota for highgrade american 
beef imports since 1983 under a fouryear agreement that expired 
thursday its overall quota for beef imports was raised by a 
smaller amount 
the united states said it would petition the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade an international forum that oversees trade 
rules to have the import quota procedures deemed illegal 
prime minister noboru takeshita said monday he would decide 
japans negotiating position by may 4 the date a gatt panel takes 
up the us grievance 
mrs higo said my sons prefer american beef theyre only 
concerned about volume in their meat and are not too particular 
about the taste 
but my husband and i we prefer japanese beef its so much 
more tender and better tasting also its a lot easier on the 
teeth added the 48yearold housewife 
tsukasa yanagi assistant manager at peacock said the store 
sells about 154 pounds of japanese beef a day but regulations 
limit it to selling only 28 pounds of american beef a day 
of course if our store quota is increased we can sell a lot 
more said yanagi by the end of the day the foreign beef is 
always sold out because its much cheaper 
wed like to be able to keep more american beef he added 
our no 1 priority is to provide customers with tasty but 
inexpensive meat 
yanagi said the stores beef prices and sales quotas are set by 
the quasigovernmental livestock industry promotion corporation 
lipc 
that organization set up in 1961 to regulate and stabilize beef 
prices handles about 80 percent of the meat sold nationwide said 
mitsuru yoshida a director at the organization 
he said the ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries 
annually decides the floor and ceiling wholesale prices for 
domestic beef 
the price of the imported beef is then fixed according to its 
nearest corresponding japanese cut 
when the wholesale prices are decided the beef both imported 
and domestic is channeled to distributors and normal costs 
including retailers profits are added 
once the meat is on the supermarket shelves if the price of 
the domestic beef shoots up the amount of the imported beef is 
increased yoshida said if the price of the japanese beef 
falls the foreign meat is pulled back from the market 
but if the price of japanese beef fails to rise the lipc will 
buy the meat and keep it in stock yoshida said 
this nontariff barrier is typical of japanese efforts to 
cushion local industries against foreign competition 
zenchu the central union of agricultural cooperatives is also 
going after the heart and mind of the japanese consumer it has 
produced a video showing what it claims are the harmful side 
effects of eating imported food loaded with preservatives and 
chemicals said a spokeswoman for the alljapan agricultural cinema 
association which produced the 30minute movie 
titled even then would you still eat it the video alleges 
that monkeys fed imported food gave birth to deformed babies while 
the number of japanese children falling sick after eating the food 
has increased 
the spokeswoman said about 2000 copies of the video have been 
sold at 80 a copy since it was released in january most to 
agricultural concerns 
kumiko sato a mother of three children says she does not cook 
foreign beef because it smells and the blood is not drained 
totally from the meat 
i prefer japanese beef because its tender and does not 
contain too much oil she said but its so expensive 
japan should liberalize its market so that at least local 
prices will fall she added

four days into the season oregon shrimp 
fishermen have yet to settle on a price and no one appears to be in 
any hurry to set one fisheries officials said today 
processors have abundant inventories of shrimp left over from 
last years catch and bad weather over the weekend would have kept 
fishermen in port even if they had a price said mark saelens 
shellfish biologist for the oregon department of fish and wildlife 
the typical process is fishermen will not come to a settlement 
during a time of unsettled weather said saelens theyre 
really in no hurry 
when the season opened friday shrimp fishermen up and down the 
west coast stayed in port rather than accept the going rate of 
about 40 cents a pound 
neil richmond of the oregon department of fish and wildlife in 
charleston said he hadnt heard of any price settlements in 
california or washington either 
we are hopeful it will be settled by midweek said richmond 
shrimpers in astoria were to meet with processors tuesday to 
discuss a price said grant larson plant manager at ocean foods of 
astoria inc 
however with bad weather making fishing difficult he didnt 
hold out much hope for an immediate agreement 
i dont see anything happening for the rest of the week he 
said 
with a catch of 46 million pounds last year oregons fleet of 
120 shrimp boats is the leading producer of pink shrimp on the west 
coast washingtons catch was 16 million pounds and californias 
was 8 million pounds 
between 1 million and 2 million pounds of shrimp left over from 
last year is still on hand in cold storage saelens said 
not only do they have an inventory they have to get rid of 
but the market itself is not as interested in consuming whatever 
grade that is they are handling saelens said 
richmond said he had heard prices under discussion ranged 
between 35 cents per pound and 55 cents per pound 
the processors feel they cant pay what the fishermen are 
asking and the fishermen feel they cant afford to go out at the 
price they are offering saelens said 
last years price averaged 68 cents per pound with a high of 80 
cents in may brought on by strong demand 
in recent years the value of catches has been hurt by a large 
number of small shrimp known as pinheads by law catches cant 
exceed 160 shrimp per pound 
in general sometime in midsummer late june july the 
pinheads are first reaching a size when 100 percent of them will be 
legal saelens said

fw woolworth co said monday it received 
notice that dart group corp intends to acquire a substantial 
amount of the retailers stock in what could be the beginning of a 
takeover bid for the nations 13th largest retailer 
woolworth which built its reputation in the fiveanddime store 
business before expanding into specialty retailing responded to 
darts move with the adoption by its board of a poisonpill 
takeover defense 
the retailer said in a statement it was notified a partnership 
controlled by dart chairman herbert haft had filed with federal 
antitrust officials documents indicating the group intended to 
acquire 15 million or more of woolworths stock 
less than a month ago the haft family dropped a 103 billion 
bid for stop amp shop cos after their target agreed to a leveraged 
buyout by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
wall street expected the hafts to make a bid for woolworth the 
retailers stock shot up 825 to 5350 in late afternoon on the 
new york stock exchange 
the hafts have said in the past they are serious about buying 
and operating a retailer but doubts linger about their intentions 
darts string of unsuccessful but profitable takeover attempts in 
recent years has given herbert haft and his son dart president 
robert haft reputations as corporate raiders 
robert haft was not available when a reporter called for comment 
monday 
a source close to dart confirmed that the partnership had made a 
filing on march 18 with the federal government in compliance with 
the hartscottrodino antitrust act 
under the act parties seeking to acquire a substantial stake in 
a company must notify the government of their intentions 
the source declined to say whether a takeover bid was in the 
offing 
karen sack a retail industry analyst with standard amp poors 
corp said woolworth has been mentioned recently as a possible 
target for a takeover attempt 
edward johnson an analyst with prescott ball amp turben inc 
said wall street believes woolworth stock would be worth about 67 
under a buyout the low stock price and woolworths lowrental 
properties and successful specialty store formats make it an 
attractive target he said 
if the hafts do make a bid woolworth would be expected to fight 
it in the companys statement it said the retailers board had 
adopted the poison pill to deter coercive or unfair takeover 
tactics and to prevent an acquirer from gaining control of the 
company without offering a fair price to all shareholders 
the pill adopted by woolworths board would allow the companys

effect when a person or group acquires 20 percent of woolworths 
stock on the commencement of a tender offer for 30 percent or more 
of the retailers shares or when an adverse party acquires at 
least 15 percent of the companys stock 
joseph carroll a woolworth spokesman declined to comment when 
asked what steps the company might take if and when the hafts make 
a takeover bid 
johnson said the company might consider going private under a 
leveraged buyout 
other options open to the retailer include making an acquisition 
itself or spinning off one of its units to shareholders 
woolworth founded 109 years ago by frank w woolworth as a 
fiveanddime store has grown to an empire of more than 6300 
general merchandise and specialty stores worldwide in recent 
years the company has shifted its focus from its wellknown 
woolworth stores to its specialty operations which include kinney 
shoe stores and foot locker and lady foot locker athletic footwear 
stores 
ms sack said woolworth has done very well as a result of 
its restructuring 
for the fiscal year ended jan 30 woolworth earned 251 million 
on sales of 714 billion 
before their unsuccessful attempt at taking over stop amp shop 
the hafts began a hostile bid for dayton hudson corp that they 
were forced to end when the stock market crashed their previous 
targets include supermarkets general corp and safeway stores inc 
dart has made hundreds of millions of dollars from their 
takeover forays by selling their stock at a higher price after the 
companies successfully defended themselves 
johnson said that if the hafts are serious about buying a 
retailer woolworth with its specialty operations would be an 
appropriate target dart operates two specialty chains crown books 
and trak auto

soybean futures prices soared and set new 
contract highs while grains were mostly higher in trading monday at 
the chicago board of trade 
the agriculture departments reports on spring planting 
intentions and grain stocks sparked a flurry on buying in the 
soybean pit where traders saw indications of tight soybean 
supplies in the coming year 
the departments annual report on farmers spring planting 
intentions released thursday predicted about a 1 percent increase 
in soybean acreage to 579 million acres well below the estimate 
of 591 million acres 
the departments quarterly grain stocks report estimated 
soybeans at almost 115 billion bushels as of march 1 slightly 
below the prereport estimate 
new contract highs were made in soybeans but buying slacked off 
amid heavy profittaking later in the session said victor 
lespinasse an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc 
buying in new crop corn for delivery in deferred months was 
sparked by the report showing spring planting intentions at 669 
million acres up 2 percent from last year but well below 
expectations lespinasse said 
but more bearish news came from the corn stocks estimate of 76 
billion bushels slightly above estimates 
wheat prices rose in sympathy with strength in the beans 
lespinasse said 
at the close wheat was cents to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 300 a bushel corn was cent 
lower to 3 cents higher with may at 209 a bushel oats were 2 
cents to 4 cents higher with may at 164 a bushel and soybeans 
were 15 cents to 18 cents higher with may at 669 a bushel

the supreme court on monday let stand a 3 
million libel award won by cigarette maker brown amp williamson 
tobacco corp against cbs inc and a television anchorman in 
chicago 
in another significant case the high court agreed to review 
rulings limiting korean air lines financial liability for a 1983 
disaster in which 269 people died the shooting down of a kal 
passenger jet over soviet airspace 
the justices also agreed to examine the authority of federal 
judges to secondguess decisions by pension and welfare plans that 
deny benefits to workers 
in other decisions announced monday in businessrelated cases 
the high court 
refused to block the federal trade commission from 
investigating allegedly anticompetitive practices of state 
agencies that license and regulate professionals 
gave federal agencies more leeway in dealing with labor unions 
representing their employees and 
rejected a challenge to new york citys rent control law 
in the tobacco libel decision the court without comment 
rejected arguments that the 3 million award one of the largest 
libel verdicts ever upheld on appeal violated the rights of cbs 
and its newscaster 
brown amp williamson which makes viceroy cigarettes accused the 
network and wbbmtv anchorman walter jacobson of libeling it in a 
nov 11 1981 broadcast the chicago station is owned and operated 
by cbs 
jacobson was accused of libeling the cigarette company in a 
nightly feature called walter jacobsons perspective 
he said there was a viceroy advertising strategy to attract 
young people to smoking by relating cigarettes to pot wine beer 
and sex he said the idea was to present cigarette smoking as 
an initiation into the adult world as an illicit pleasure 
his remarks were based in part on what he said was a 
confidential report prepared by the federal trade commission 
the korean air lines case stemmed from the september 1983 air 
disaster in which a soviet military plane shot down kal flight 007 
en route from new york city to seoul south korea the korean 
airliner had flown more than 300 miles off course after leaving 
anchorage alaska and had entered soviet airspace over the sea of 
japan 
the supreme court justices said they will study arguments that 
korean air lines should have to face more than 75000 in damages 
for each death 
in the pension case the court said it will hear an appeal by 
firestone tire amp rubber co in a case stemming from the sale of its 
plastics division in 1980 
firestone sold the division to occidental petroleum corp the 
sale affected some 500 workers at firestone plants in pennsylvania 
new jersey maryland and louisiana 
the workers then sought certain benefits from firestone 
including early retirement and severance pay that were included in 
the companys pension and welfare plan 
the company denied the benefits it also refused to give the 
workers information they requested about the benefit plan on 
grounds they no longer were employed by firestone 
the workers sued in federal court charging that the company 
violated the federal employee retirement and income security act of 
1974 erisa 
a judge threw out the suit on grounds that firestone did not act 
in an arbitrary and capricious manner the 3rd us circuit court 
of appeals reinstated the suit however

for the decades when fw woolworth cos 
fiveanddimes dotted the retail landscape the company symbolized 
homespun american merchandising 
but changing times and consumer taste forced the 109yearold 
company to take harsh measures to keep that image from fading like 
an old tintype photograph 
those efforts paid off so well in terms of the bottom line that 
woolworth not only returned to the path of profitability but now 
lies in the takeover path of marylands raiding haft family 
the hafts who have left a string of aborted acquisition 
attempts for other major retailers in their wake said in 
government documents that they intend to buy up to 15 million in 
woolworth stock in what could be the first step in a takeover bid 
for all their overtures the fatherandson team of herbert and 
robert haft and their dart group corp is short on the retail 
tradition woolworth is steeped in 
founded in 1879 by upstate new york farmboy frank woolworth the 
chain pioneered the fivecent counter which carried everything 
from bobby pins to real crystal glasses woolworths 
rummagesale prices allowed the homemaker of yesteryear to outfit a 
kitchen with gadgetry from potato mashers to frying pans for just a 
few dollars 
the publics welcoming of woolworth with open pocketbook spurred 
the company to add a 10cent line in turn forcing a name change to 
woolworths 5 and 10 cent store 
while the fiveanddime label still sticks the description 
became a misnomer in 1932 when the company could no longer sell its 
products for 5 and 10 cents woolworth spokesman jf carroll said 
the 60story headquarters in lower manhattan the company built 
in 1913 replete with gargoyles and patterned after a gothic 
cathedral was a testament to the chains status among its peers 
but woolworths rankings slipped consistently in recent years 
in 1979 it was the nations fourth largest today it is no 13 
ss kresge co always lurking nearby as a major competitor 
surpassed woolworths long ago by successful suburban expansion 
through k mart the name kresge adopted in 1977 
woolworth began to lose its footing when it rode a 
diversification wave in the early 1960s by starting woolco discount 
department stores 
woolco which became too big too fast and whose growth took 
place without direction would become the companys major 
weakness the late chairman edward f gibbons once said 
the division rang up 21 billion of the corporations 72 
billion in sales in 1981 but woolco had to keep borrowing to 
support its sales growth and ultimately failed to make any money 
by 1983 woolworth had closed all 336 woolco stores in the united 
states it sold its majority interest in its british subsidiary and 
took a 435 million aftertax writeoff 
they bit the bullet and ever since they have done a superb job 
of turning things around said stewart spector a vice president 
at furman selz mager dietz amp birney getting rid of woolco is 
what did it he noted 
the comeback was remarkable analysts agree woolworth quickly 
began spending hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade its 
stores and product line even though it still remains a 
merchandiser of lowerpriced goods 
during woolco the us variety stores were starved for 
attention in capital woolworths carroll said to date more than 
400 stores have been refurbished 
today woolworth has 1695 general merchandise stores and 4614 
specialty stores which include kinney shoes foot locker and lady 
foot locker athletic shops kids mart afterthoughts and richman 
brothers co 
for the fiscal year ended jan 30 woolworth reported profits of 
251 million on sales of 71 billion in the previous year the 
company reported net income of 214 million on sales of 65 
billion 
the company opened the first of a new downsized unit called 
woolworth express in flint mich last fall the conveniencetype 
store is a prototype for 15 others expected to be completed this 
year 
similarly the hafts dart group established as a 
washingtonarea discount drug chain in the 1950s made its mark as 
a discounter but industry analysts see the company these days more 
as a predator than a retailing competitor 
after several takeover attempts the hafts have yet to purchase 
a single store although they have made hundreds of millions of 
dollars from payments and profits on their stock holdings in 
companies they have attempted to take over 
those include dayton hudson corp supermarkets general corp 
safeway stores inc and most recently stop amp shop cos 
one analyst noted that the hafts have made more money as losers 
than many raiders make as winners

a federal appeals court monday upheld jc 
penney cos defense of a company policy which permits medical and 
dental insurance coverage of a penney employees spouse only if the 
spouse earns less than the employee 
a threejudge panel of the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
ruled 21 that the head of household provision of penneys 
insurance plan is lawful under title vii of the federal civil 
rights act of 1964 
the appeals courts majority ruled that the requirement is legal 
because it is not sexbased but is instead conditioned on a head 
of household status 
the court ruled against the equal employment opportunity 
commission which argued that the policy amounts to unequal 
treatment of penneys female employees and was therefore illegal 
discrimination based on an employees sex 
us district judge robert demascio in detroit ruled at trial 
that the policy did have an unequal impact on female employees but 
he said the eeoc had not proven that jc penney co had a 
discriminatory motive in adopting the requirement 
the appeals courts majority ruled that demascio correctly 
dismissed the eeocs complaint because penneys policy does not 
violate federal civil rights law 
the appellate majority found that penney adopted the head of 
household requirement in order to provide spouse insurance only for 
employees who most needed the coverage those without more highly 
paid spouses the requirement also is an efficient administrative 
tool for avoiding providing coverage of spouses most likely to have 
coverage from their own employers the appeals courts majority 
said 
this is a legitimate business justification for choosing this 
method of supplying an insurance coverage benefit the majority 
ruled in an opinion written by appeals judge danny boggs 
in a minority dissent judge douglas hillman said he would have 
reversed demascios ruling hillman said he did not find penneys 
defense of its insurance coverage policy legitimate 
title viis prohibition against compensation practices that 
discriminate against women employees does not vary with the type of 
compensation chosen by the employer hillman wrote

union carbide corp said monday it would 
study a decision by a court in india before deciding whether to 
appeal the courts order to pay 192 million in interim relief for 
victims of the 1984 bhopal gas disaster 
but carbide said from its headquarters in danbury that the 
ruling by the high court in the central indian state of madhya 
pradesh will not serve the real needs of the bhopal victims 
the high court judge is holding union carbide liable and this 
can only result in additional litigation while the genuine victims 
remain in the wings said robert m berzok a carbide spokesman 
the court ruled monday on carbides appeal of an earlier 
decision in which a district judge ordered an interim relief 
payment of 270 million union carbide had argued that the interim 
relief could prejudice a decision in the indian governments 3 
billion suit against the company 
the ruling by the madhya pradesh court which can be appealed to 
indias supreme court reduced the size of the interim award by 78 
million and ordered carbide to deposit the sum within two months 
high court judge sk seth said he made the reduction after 
considering the needs of the victims 
berzok said carbide has about 192 million in insurance to cover 
an interim relief payment 
the fact that the court reduced the amount to union carbide 
corps insurance coverage does not change the basic failure to 
provide a trial showing the cause of the tragedy and the real 
extent of the damages berzok said 
in trading on the new york stock exchange union carbide common 
stock slipped 50 cents a share to 2275 
one analyst said mondays ruling doesnt mean too much to 
carbide 
james wilbur who follows carbide for the investment firm smith 
barney harris upham and co said carbide will probably appeal to 
the supreme court 
he said even if the supreme court rules against carbide indian 
authorities have to get approval from a us court in order for 
funds to be paid 
he said carbide and the indian government agreed before the 
court proceedings began that a us court would have the authority 
to approve any final decision reached in india 
the leak of toxic gas on dec 3 1984 came from a pesticide 
plant run by a company subsidiary union carbide of india it was 
the worlds worst industrial disaster killing more than 2800 
people and injuring at least 20000 around the plant in bhopal 
capital of madhya pradesh 
the indian government sued union carbide in september 1986 
contending the leak was caused by negligence the company has said 
it resulted from sabotage by a disgruntled employee

batus inc approached stockholders of 
farmers group inc on monday with a proposal hinting at a possible 
increase in the 63 per share bid for the nations seventh largest 
insurer 
batus said it would consider paying more in a friendly 
transaction supported by the board of farmers group 
batus has been trying since january to win control of the los 
angeles company but its directors have refused to negotiate with 
batus the american subsidiary of the londonbased bat industries 
inc plc 
we saw their fullpage ad in the wall street journal and there 
will be no comment said tom welch director of corporate 
investments for farmers 
wall street reacted to the latest move by sending farmers stock 
up 62 cents per share to 5962 per share in overthecounter 
trading batus shares closed down 25 cents per share at 775 per 
share on the american stock exchange 
batus which also made its appeal by mail accused farmers 
board of failing to tell shareholders what would happen to the 
price of their stock if batus 45 billion offer was defeated 
the letter said the board has not offered any firm proposal 
designed to provide you with 63 or more for your stock instead 
of writing to you the board set forth its opinion that the company 
should maintain its existence as an independent corporation 
batus further charged the directors had been talking with a 
third party about a possible leveraged buyout of the company 
dont you think it strange that they have failed to contact 
batus the only company that has made a public offer for their 
shares batus asked the stockholders 
batus described its current bid as a 47 percent premium over the 
43 market price just before the merger was proposed 
batus first approached stockholders last month seeking proxies 
in support of a nonbinding resolution it intends to present at 
farmers annual meeting may 20 
the resolution would give stockholders an opportunity to express 
their support for the sale and encourage farmers board to 
facilitate such a sale batus said 
nine states would have to approve any takeover said gene 
russell manager of communications for batus 
the california insurance commissioner has scheduled public 
hearings may 46 with a decision expected by may 13 and the 
kansas insurance department has set up a hearing on proxy 
solicitation on april 20 earlier the department reported that the 
proxy solicitation might be illegal and may have to be halted 
farmers also operates in arizona idaho illinois ohio oregon 
texas and washington 
russell said monday that batus was successful in challenging a 
19yearold nevada law allowing stockholders only 60 days to decide 
whether to take advantage of a tender offer from a hostile or 
friendly bidder 
a federal judge ruled the nevada takeover act violates both the 
supremacy and the commerce clauses of the constitution and ordered 
nevada not to enforce it 
the challenge was heard in nevada because farmers is incorported 
there 
batus has extended the expiration date of its bid to april 27 
and announced that as of march 29 approximately 3570000 shares 
had been tendered 
batus owns tobacco retailing and paper goods companies in the 
united states including brown and williamson tobacco corp saks 
fifth avenue and marshall fields 
farmers with about 11 billion in assets is the nations third 
largest home and auto insurer and the seventh largest property and 
casualty insurer

consumer confidence dipped slightly in march 
amid concern about unemployment according to a survey released 
monday 
the conference board reported that its consumer confidence index 
slipped to 1128 from 1149 last month the index has a 1985 base 
of 100 
despite recently favorable employment figures reported by 
washington virtually all of the decline in consumer confidence was 
due to growing concern about jobs said fabian linden an 
economist with the business research organization 
the conference board said consumers are confident about general 
business conditions but 29 percent of the surveys respondents 
said jobs were plentiful down from 31 percent in february 
it is too early to tell whether this is a temporary aberration 
or if consumers know something the us labor department has yet to 
learn linden said 
the government reported last week that unemployment declined to 
56 percent in march largely because of a drop in the total work 
force 
the conference board survey questioned 5000 households across 
the country it was conducted by national family opinion inc of

leapt as the us credit market got its first chance to respond to 
last weeks report on march unemployment 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond fell 1 points or 
1250 for every 1000 in face value its yield which moves 
inversely to its price had soared to 886 percent from 875 
percent late thursday 
the credit markets were closed friday in observance of the good 
friday and passover holidays 
analysts said bond traders saw the governments latest 
unemployment report as evidence that the economy may be heating up 
and inflation may accelerate 
the labor department said last friday that the us unemployment 
fell to 56 percent in march while nonfarm payroll employment rose 
by a largerthanexpected 262000 jobs 
bond investors took the news as a cue to sell bonds because 
resilience in the economy could signal a resurgence of inflation 
which erodes bond values 
william v sullivan jr director of money market research for 
the investment firm dean witter reynolds inc said the report also 
dims any prospects of fed easing or lower interest rates in the 
near term 
if the economy bounces too strongly the federal reserve could 
put a lid on expansion by raising interest rates which would push 
bond prices lower 
meanwhile the treasury department auctioned 128 billion in 
shortterm securities at the highest rates since midjanuary 
the government sold 64 billion in threemonth bills at an 
average discount rate of 598 percent up from 569 percent last 
week another 64 billion was sold in sixmonth bills at an 
average discount rate of 621 percent up from 60 percent last 
week 
the rates were the highest since jan 19 when threemonth bills 
sold for an identical 598 percent and sixmonth bills averaged 
637 percent 
in a separate report the federal reserve said monday that the 
average yield for oneyear treasury bills the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages was 678 percent 
last week up from 677 percent the previous week 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues fell point from last thursday intermediate 
maturities dropped 1832 point to point and longterm issues 
tumbled 2532 point according to figures provided by telerate 
inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer had tumbled 666 to 116192 the merrill lynch 
composite index which makes a similar measurement fell 062 to 
11110 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer lost 186 at 27918 
yields on threemonth treasury bills meanwhile jumped 13 basis

torrington co has filed petitions with 
the federal government charging that foreign manufacturers are 
dumping antifriction bearings in the united states and hurting 
domestic manufacturers 
torrington the largest broadline bearing maker in the united 
states and a subsidary of ingersollrand filed antidumping and 
countervailing duty petitions last week against a number of 
european and asian nations exporting antifriction bearings to the 
united states 
countries named in the unfair trade petitions are japan west 
germany italy france the united kingdom sweden singapore 
thailand and romania 
imports of bearings covered by petitions amounted to roughly 
500 million in 1987 the petitions claim that the dumping had 
reached significant levls with foreign manufacturers selling 
bearings in the united states at prices as low as half their fair 
market value 
torrington is committed to taking positive action to stop the 
dumping of bearings in the us market said thomas e bennett 
company president our industry continues unnecessarily to be 
the victim of unfairly low pricing by many of our foreign 
competitors 
these unfair trade petitions are intended to neutralize the 
dumping and subsidization that have distorted conditions of 
competition in the united states market 
the companys petitions were filed last thursday with the 
international trade commission and the us department of commerce 
the two government agencies responsible for investigating charges 
of unfair trade practices 
preliminary findings are anticipated from the international 
trade commission by midmay and from the commerce department 
sometime between late june and late fall 
dwight keeney a company spokesman said government figures 
indicate that from 1980 to 1985 employment in the domestic 
bearings industry declined 247 percent from 52600 to 39600 
loss of production jobs in the industy for the same period was 
265 percent from 42300 jobs in 1980 to 31100 jobs in 1985 
keeney said the decline continues

a holding company controlled by the belzberg 
family of canada has agreed to pay a 400000 fine to settle a 
lawsuit charging its 1986 purchase of ashland oil co stock 
violated an antitakeover law 
the settlement between the federal trade commission and first 
city financial corp ltd of vancouver british columbia was made 
public in court papers filed last week in us district court here 
the ftc charged in a lawsuit filed friday along with the 
proposed settlement that first city violated the hartscottrodino 
antitrust law by failing to notify the government of ashland stock 
purchases exceeding 15 million 
the complaint charged that first city and its parent roxboro 
investments ltd had also violated the law by continuing to 
purchase more than a 15 million stake in ashland without notifying 
the ftc and observing a 30day waiting period 
first city said in a statement it did not violate the 
hartscottrodino act but agreed to settle to avoid the expense 
of singlehandedly litigating a longstanding interpretive dispute 
between the ftc and the investment community 
the settlement must be given final approval by us district 
judge john h pratt 
the oil companys stock rose 10 percent following a march 25 
1986 announcement that the belzbergs had acquired 92 percent of 
ashland stock and offered to pay 60 a share to buy a controlling 
interest in the kentuckybased refining company 
on april 2 1986 the belzberg companies sold their 92 percent 
stake in ashland for 1341 million under an agreement with the oil 
company 
first city is also a defendant in a parallel action brought in 
federal court here by the securities and exchange commission 
arising from the transaction 
the sec suit charges that first city arranged for its brokerage 
house bear stearns amp co to buy and hold shares of ashland stock 
so that the canadian firm could avoid the premerger notifcation 
requirements 
first city has denied there was any understanding with bear 
stearns

bullish government reports indicating soybean supplies may be 
tighter than expected this year sent soybean futures prices soaring 
in trading monday at the chicago board of trade 
in other markets where trading was often volatile grain prices 
were mostly higher precious metals rallied cattle prices were 
mostly lower the pork complex was mixed energy prices were mostly 
lower and stockindex futures were mostly lower 
reports from the us department of agriculture released after 
thursdays preholiday trading session sparked a wave of buying in 
soybeans bean prices hit new contract highs before a wave of 
profittaking late in the session offset earlier advances 
the usda annual report on farmers spring planting intentions 
predicted about a 1 percent increase in soybean acreage to 579 
million acres well below the estimate of 591 million acres 
the departments quarterly grain stocks report estimated 
soybeans at almost 115 billion bushels as of march 1 slightly 
below the prereport estimate 
buying in new crop corn for delivery in deferred months was 
sparked by the report showing spring planting intentions at 669 
million acres up 2 percent from last year but well below 
expectations said victor lespinasse an analyst with dean witter 
reynolds inc in chicago 
but more bearish news came from the corn stocks estimate of 76 
billion bushels slightly above estimates 
wheat prices rose in sympathy with strength in the beans 
lespinasse said 
wheat settled cent to 3 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in may at 300 a bushel corn settled 1 cent lower to 3 
cents higher with may at 208 a bushel oats settled 2 cents to 
4 cents higher with may at 164 a bushel and soybeans settled 
15 cents to 17 cents higher with may at 668 a bushel 
volatility marked trading at the chicago mercantile exchange in 
cattle and hogs which advanced sharply early in the session on 
optimism stemming from the usdas quarterly hog and pig report 
released thursday but plummeted on late profittaking and other 
technical factors analysts said 
the report put the hog and pig count in states that account for 
80 percent of us production at about 405 million head as of 
march 1 though the 6 percent increase over last year met analysts 
expectations the report indicated smaller increases in hog herd 
expansion than anticipated analysts said 
philip stanley an analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc 
in chicago said there were no outside influences to explain the 
markets sharp selloff late in the session 
live cattle prices settled unchanged to 145 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in april at 7362 cents a pound feeder 
cattle settled 115 cents to 150 cents lower with april at 7940 
cents a pound hogs were 17 cent lower to 132 cents higher with 
april at 4535 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 112 
cents lower to 185 cents higher with may at 55 cents a pound 
gold and silver futures prices rallied in topsyturvy trading at 
the new york commodity exchange 
early gains were sparked by the us dollars weak performance 
and fears of an inflationary trend stemming from fridays report of 
a 56 percent jobless rate in march the lowest in nine years said 
jack barbanel director of the futures trading division at gruntal 
amp co in new york 
but while the market closed up gains by the end of the day 
evaporated on profittaking he said 
gold settled 160 to 280 higher with the contract for 
delivery in april at 45670 a troy ounce while silver settled 34 
cents to 77 cents higher with april at 6789 a troy ounce 
cotton futures fell monday in volatile trading at the new york 
cotton exchange 
prices rallied early in the session on the usdas prospetive 
plantings report for cotton in 1988 which came out a little 
below expectations said ernest simon a cotton specialist in new 
york with prudentialbache securities 
but the report still indicated a goodsized crop and prices 
dropped sharply later in the session simon said 
cotton prices settled 75 cent to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 6088 cents a pound 
energy futures prices were mostly lower in quiet trading at the 
new york mercantile exchange 
crude oil settled unchanged to 8 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in april at 1641 a barrel heating oil was 15 cent 
to 27 cent lower with may at 46 cents a gallon and unleaded 
gasoline settled 03 cent to 21 cent lower with may at 4935 
cents a gallon 
stockindex futures were mostly lower on the chicago mercantile

the federal home loan bank board announced 
monday it was revising the way it calculates the required capital 
levels that must be met by the countrys savings and loan 
associations 
the bank board has set a goal of boosting the minimum capital 
requirement for sampls eventually to 6 percent of assets up from an 
initial 3 percent level set last year 
the rule change announced monday affects the calculation used to 
determine how much the capital requirement will be boosted each 
year 
officials said the change was required because the old 
calculation method would have resulted in the minimum capital 
requirement declining this year reflecting the record 68 billion 
that federally insured sampls lost in 1987 
the old process involved adding up total industry earnings and 
dividing by total assets under the new procedure the 
profitability of each sampl will be determined and then a midpoint 
level will be selected and that figure will be used to set the 
increase in capital which will be required 
brian smith director of regulatory affairs for the us league 
of savings institutions said the industry had no objection to the 
change 
we understand that average earnings results were very 
distorted he said for the bulk of the business that is not 
doing too badly this makes sense 
the bank board gave no estimate of what the new minimum capital 
requirement will be but smith estimated it could rise to around 
34 percent the new capital requirement will take effect for the 
quarter beginning on july 1 
use of the new rule will reduce the time required to reach the 6 
percent requirement to less than 12 years the bank board said as 
opposed to an estimated 40 years using the old process 
the change on capital requirements followed a decision last 
friday by the bank board to prevent a planned drop in the special 
assessments being levied on sampls 
the board voted to continue the special assessment rate of 
132nd of 1 percent of insured deposits for the first quarter of 
1988 that is added to the onetwelfth of 1 percent that is 
collected from both banks and sampls as the standard fee for insuring 
individual deposits up to a maximum of 100000 
congress last year in passing a measured aimed at bailing at 
the insolvent sampl insurance fund had called for the surcharge to 
begin declining unless the bank board blocked the drop in 
assessments 
for the past two quarters the bank board has vetoed any 
assessment decline officials justify the action on the grounds 
that growing losses at sampls prevent any move to allow the 
assessment to decline 
however the us league the industrys biggest lobbying group 
attacked that decision saying that it flies in the face of the 
understanding between savings institutions and the administration 
made last summer when congress authorized the assessments 
the bank board has said it will announce sometime this week a 
proposed plan for a new variable assessment program that would free 
the bestcapitalized sampls from paying the surcharge 
this proposal is aimed at keeping healthy savings and loans from 
leaving the ailing federal savings and loan insurance corp which 
insures sampls for the federal deposit insurance corp which 
insures banks and has no surcharge 
such shifts will be permitted after aug 10 unless congress 
decides to block them while sampls which decided to make the move 
would be charged an exit fee they would be able to earn that money 
back in only a few years through the lower insurance costs

ben amp jerry those irrepressible vermont 
icecream makers conceded monday that it may be easier to make 
coffee heath bar crunch than to make a new york subway station 
shine 
it was about a year ago that ben cohen and jerry greenfield 
whose ben amp jerrys ice cream has become a favorite of the upscale 
ice cream set proposed to spruce up and maintain a subway station 
in manhattan the company is based in waterbury vt 
their choice was the 72nd street irt station which cohen just 
down from vermont found really disgusting most new yorkers 
would say its better than most but thats another story 
cohen and greenfield offered to spend their entire new york 
advertising budget for the year 200000 to 250000 cleaning 
painting and maintaining the station 
the transit authority said yes the transport workers union said 
no 
the problem was that ben amp jerry wanted to use some nonunion 
workers on the project our position said union spokesman jim 
gannon is that well cooperate but the people who do the work 
have to be ta employees 
negotiations dragged on and ben amp jerry finally set a march 31 
deadline that passed too the matter went before an independent 
arbitrator who is expected to rule soon 
so on monday ben amp jerry set up an ice cream wagon and a van at 
a park across the street from the subway station and began doling 
out free ice cream to anyone who wanted it it was supposed to be a 
consolation prize for subway passengers emerging from the filthy 
station ben amp jerry were there to promise that theyd keep trying 
to spruce it up 
nobody seemed to care about the station though not while 
there was free ice cream to be had 
i love the fact that the homeless people keep going back for 
seconds mused ben amp jerrys sales and marketing director allan 
kaufman 
it doesnt look like theyre getting the message said ben 
breaking into gales of laughter 
its ok with me said jerry

international business machines corp confirmed 
monday it has been privately offering to sell computer chips to 
other companies for about two years 
but ibm denied that its aim was to prevent the us electronics 
industry from becoming overly dependent on japanese chip suppliers 
instead it said it was trying to test the quality of its own 
chips by seeing if anyone else would want to buy them 
ibm is the worlds largest maker of semiconductors but consumes 
almost all of its own output the company said it never had the 
intention of entering the merchant chip market on a large scale 
it said it had offered limited quantities of semiconductors to 
a very small number of companies internationally it declined to 
confirm it had actually made any sales 
the goal is to sharpen ourselves competitively by having these 
companies customers assess price function and performance 
against the best chips in the world available from other vendors 
which of course includes the japanese ibm spokesman peter thonis 
said 
the first report that ibm had offered to sell chips to 
competitors came last month in a new book trading places how we 
allowed japan to take the lead by clyde prestowitz formerly the 
commerce departments chief trade negotiator 
details were reported monday by the new york times based on 
anonymous sources and an interview with jack kuehler an ibm vice 
chairman 
the offers were apparently kept undisclosed at the request of 
the potential customers which did not want it known that they were 
considering buying chips from ibm 
testing of chips in actual business conditions provides the 
best gauge of how ibms technology stacks up thonis said monday 
in some cases we found we were not as competitive and in those 
instances weve worked to correct it in other areas we found we 
were true industry leaders 
ibm said it was offering only its chips not its underlying 
designs or process technology it declined to comment on how many 
companies had bought chips if any the value of the purchases or 
the names of any customers 
ibm would have to increase its chip production vastly to become 
an important alternative source of chips for us or european 
electronics companies and the company said it did not have that in 
mind 
were neither accepting orders for semiconductors nor 
increasing capacity thonis said 
ibm officials have said the companys own health depends on 
maintaining a strong domestic ability to produce chips training a 
large number of microelectronic engineers and sustaining a strong 
semiconductor equipment manufacturing business so ibm will not need 
to depend on japan for the most uptodate technology 
along those lines ibm has been a major backer of sematech the 
industrygovernment project to improve the quality of chip 
manufacturing technology in the united states 
in his book prestowitz said digital equipment corp ibms 
biggest rival was one of the companies that held talks with ibm on 
chip purchases digitals president kenneth olsen seemed to 
confirm that in a new york times interview 
but mark fredrickson a digital spokesman said monday the 
company could not confirm the discussions he also denied 
suggestions that digital was in danger of becoming overly dependent 
on japanese chips 
we think that the amount of value we add from capabilities 
within our own organization is so pervasive that to suggest that 
there is a dangerous dependence on anyone from outside doesnt make 
sense fredrickson said

irving bank corp predicted monday that it would 
earn a profit of more than 200 million in 1988 and it urged 
shareholders again to reject as inadequate bank of new yorks 
hostile 108 billion tender bid 
meanwhile the banking concern said it filed a lawsuit in state 
court attempting to block a proxy solicitation of bank of new york 
which began its tender offer last month and is seeking to gain 
control of irvings board of directors 
in a letter to shareholders sent over the weekend irving 
forecast 1988 net income of 234 million or about 1178 a share 
on revenue of 114 billion 
last year irving reported a loss of 1933 million compared 
with a net profit of 1281 million or 683 in 1986 largely due 
to its increased loanloss provision to cover shaky third world 
debt 
irving attributed the projected improvement in part to 
continued strong performance in its domestic and community banking 
businesses 
your company is performing in line with the 1988 forecast 
based on the results of the first two months of 1988 the letter 
said book value per share is projected to increase to 
approximately 50 from 4091 at dec 31 1987 
bank of new yorks offer represents a multiple of only 12 
times irvings forecasted book value it said 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady said we dont know the 
basis on which the calculated projections were made we cant make 
a meaningful comment 
bank of new yorks current offer of 15 in cash and 1575 
shares of its own stock for each of irvings roughly 181 common 
shares outstanding has been denounced as inadequate by irvings 
board 
last month bank of new york began its tender offer after 
receiving the goahead from the securities and exchange commission 
and the company assembled a slate of 16 nominees to irvings board 
bank of new york currently holds a 483 percent stake in irving 
irving has repeatedly stressed its desire to remain independent 
and has taken a number of steps to spurn bank of new yorks 
advances including instituting an antitakeover poison pill 
intended to make any hostile buyout prohibitively expensive 
irvings lawsuit filed in state court seeks damages in excess 
of about 350 million 
it claims that bank of new yorks proxy material is false and 
misleading particularly in the way it valued irvings portfolio of 
third world debt irving claimed the portfolio was overstated by 
about 208 million 
the suit was filed late last week and mentioned in a filing with 
the securities and exchange commission said david santos an 
irving spokesman 
brady called the suit without merit and said the banking 
concern would seek a dismissal
