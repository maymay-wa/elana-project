vice president george bush said friday he didnt authorize 
aides comments depicting edwin meese iii as a campaign liability 
but i must say i am troubled by some of the allegations against 
the attorney general while michael dukakis pocketed the 
endorsements of six democratic governors as he moved toward his 
partys nomination 
jesse jackson the only other active candidate in the 1988 
presidential race was in california as part of an intensive 
costly effort to ambush dukakis in the june 7 seasonending 
primary 
he complained anew that he was not being treated fairly in the 
partys delegate selection process but added soothingly we need 
not speak in terms of a fight 
bush took aim at both democratic candidates as he addressed a 
republican dinner at the university of nebraska in lincoln on the 
way home from three days of campaigning in the west 
its a pleasure to be here and ill be back bush told the 
group and im not going to be outhustled by the hustler from 
chicago or from that traditional liberal democrat from 
massachusetts 
it was a clear reference to the jackson who has a home in 
chicago and dukakis the governor of massachusetts bush spokesman 
stephen hart said the vice president was talking about how hard 
he jackson has hustled it was nothing derogatory 
early in the day bush the allbutcertain republican nominee 
told reporters he would have to get on the phone and find out 
what two top aides said about the attorney general whose conduct 
is being investigated by a special prosecutor 
i havent authorized anything the vice president added as 
he campaigned in idaho 
later in billings mont bush said he had talked to the aides 
but would not characterize his conversation of meese bush said 
i know him well favorably but i must say i am troubled by some 
of the allegations i think fair play dictates that the system go 
forward and make the determination 
when asked if meese had become an albatross on his campaign 
bush said an albatross i dont think so 
he added that the independent counsel probing meeses legal 
difficulties soon will release a report and well see what it 
says its only a matter of a few days away 
the comments of the bush aides were reported in the detroit 
news the latest development in an ethical controversy that has 
provided democrats with campaign ammunition and turned meese into a 
political embarrassment in the eyes of some republican strategists 
the paper in a story published earlier in the day said peter 
teeley bushs communications director and robert teeter a senior 
campaign adviser made the comments in interviews this week in 
washington 
meese is a liability teeley was quoted as saying 
what a guy like meese does is take away the opportunity to 
discuss the issues that you really want to discuss teeley told 
the newspaper i mean you are consistently asked about meeses 
problems how you deal with it how you stand one thing or 
another and that just totally diverts attention from the message 
that you are trying to get across 
all things considered you would rather not have that problem 
going on right now teeter was reported to have said no one is 
arguing that it is a plus to have that situation going on over 
there 
meese denies any wrongdoing and says he doesnt intend to 
resign and bush has never urged him to do so 
democratic frontrunner dukakis dropped off the campaign trail 
for several days divided between his statehouse office in boston 
and a private weeekend with his wife kitty 
but he won the support of the halfdozen governors mostly in 
the west in a fresh sign that the democratic party is coalescing 
behind his candidacy despite jacksons persistent challenge 
gov dukakis has emerged as the voters choice the clear 
leader in the democratic nomination process said arkansas gov 
bill clinton described as the leader in the effort to round up the 
gubernatorial support that was announced during the day it is 
time for the party leadership to unite behind his candidacy he 
said 
other than clinton the governors adding their endorsements 
and their votes as delegates to the democratic national convention 
were govs cecil andrus of idaho steve cowper of alaska ted 
schwinden of montana george sinner of north dakota and michael 
sullivan of wyoming 
clinton said friday that he had agreed to try to put together 
a number of governors as many as were willing to come out and 
endorse before the michigan caucuses march 26 but he added 
governor dukakis felt that after michigan which he lost that 
none of us should look as if they were involved in any effort to 
stop jackson who won in michigan 
thus clinton said he and the other five governors withheld 
their endorsement until now to avoid the appearance of a 
stopjackson movement 
i was very impressed that governor dukakis and his campaign 
felt strongly enough were sensitive enough that they actually 
asked people to hold off for weeks and weeks on endorsement i 
think it shows a lot of maturity and a real determination to unify 
the party clinton said 
dukakis aides said they expected additional endorsements from 
governors in the next several days possibly including oregons 
neil goldschmidt 
while the massachusetts governor solidified his position at the 
top of the ticket backstage maneuvering continued over the vice 
presidential slot 
sen john glenn of ohio a former astronaut who failed in his 
effort to win the 1984 presidential nomination signaled he was 
available if dukakis wanted him he said he would be glad to sit 
down and discuss it but added he was not campaigning for the job 
dukakis has slightly more than 1500 delegates in the associated 
press delegate count with 2081 needed to clinch the nomination 
jackson has fewer than 1000 
jackson took note of the delegate deficit he faces and said he 
was fighting the press and pundits the party the candidate 
its not just me and him he said of dukakis its me and 
them 
he had suggested on thursday that his supporters backing of the 
eventual nominee could wax or wane depending on how he was treated 
in the allocation of convention super delegates he said 
friday we need not speak in terms of a fight we will make 
our appeals to the appropriate places

abdala bucaram a fiery populist 
leader from this roughandtumble port is given a chance of 
winning ecuadors presidency even though the roman catholic church 
newspapers and others object to his raucous style and language 
the prospect that bucaram leader of the populist roldosista 
party could win the presidential runoff election sunday has 
stirred rumors of a military coup and sent tremors through 
ecuadors financial circles 
the military sent him fleeing into exile once before 
his foes accuse him of appealing to class hatred in his 
speeches but bucarams response is that he is a champion of the 
poor 
campaigning recently in guayaquils steamy heat with his shirt 
tail hanging out he called himself a goodhearted slob and 
admits he may be a bit crazy 
but his opponent in the election rodrigo borja is taking 
bucarams challenge seriously 
political analysts say bucaram has a good chance of defeating 
borja a social democrat and leader of the democratic left party 
in the runoff 
in the first round jan 31 the 36yearold bucaram won second 
place in a field of 10 candidates with 153 percent of the vote to 
203 percent for the 52yearold borja 52 
the winner sunday will replace leon febres cordero a staunchly 
conservative prous political leader whose fouryear term ends 
in august 
this nation of 10 million people wedged between colombia and 
peru has suffered in recent years from severe economic problems 
and political instability sparked in great part by bitter disputes 
between febres cordero and leftleaning parties that control 
congress 
borja who narrowly lost to febres cordero in a runoff in 1984 
has pledged to reverse the current governments freemarket 
economic policies and seek close ties with the nonaligned 
movement also known as the third world 
borjas party is ecuadors largest but his chances are 
weakened many analysts say because he is viewed as a lackluster 
speaker without strong leadership ability 
bucaram who wears a hitlerstyle mustache and says he is an 
admirer of the nazi leaders organizational genius charged at 
one point in the campaign that an international jewish 
conspiracy was against him 
catholic church leaders and newspapers have assailed bucaram for 
his use of gutterlanguage in attacks on borja bucaram has called 
borja a drunkard and drug addict in television interviews he also 
has used unprintable street language to question his foes virility 
borja lacks strength spirit bucaram said hes a 
lukewarm man abdala is different he said of himself he 
awakens passions there is no middle ground with him 
the attacks have prompted borja a calm urbane lawyer to 
respond in kind calling bucaram an irresponsible clown and a 
fascist ignoramus 
i have been accused of everything in my political career from 
narcotics trafficker to thief bucaram said in a midnight 
interview outside his small thirdfloor walkup apartment on a 
garbagelittered downtown street 
bucaram has pledged to punish the oligarchy and crack down 
on wealthy tax evaders who he charges cheat the government of up 
to 500 million a year 
a vote for me is the same as scratching a mercedes benz with a 
bottle cap he told a cheering slum crowd alluding to such an 
act as defiance of the rich 
he has promised a shoe bank to provide free shoes for all 
poor children and has pledged to nearly double the monthly minimum 
wage to 60 
his foes call him a demagogue for making such promises but 
acknowledge privately that bucaram is following in ecuadors 
tradition of populist leaders 
the late jose maria velasco ibarra won the presidency five 
times in good measure because of his inflammatory populist 
rhetoric he also was ousted four times in military coups 
bucaram was mayor of this city of 15 million people when he 
fled into exile in late 1985 to escape prison on a charge of 
slandering the armed forces a criminal offense in ecuador he had 
said all the military was good for was wasting money on parades 
in panama he was arrested on a charge of possessing five pounds 
of cocaine he claimed it was a frameup arranged by febres 
cordero a political enemy 
ecuadors congress granted him amnesty on the military offense 
and pressured panama into dropping the cocaine charge 
he returned in august 1987 to a heros welcome from his 
followers in guayaquils shantytowns 
bucaram is heir to a political dynasty of lebanese immigrants 
who settled in guayaquil ecuadors biggest city and its commercial 
hub his sister elsa was elected mayor of guayaquil in the 
general elections this past january 
even political foes say bucaram was successful in administering 
guayaquil a tough port city that has proved unmanageable for many 
mayors 
he won over hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers by paving 
streets piping in drinking water and providing other essential 
services 
he cracked down on street crime and kept the city clean by 
jailing anyone who let garbage pile up in front of his property

a journalist freed with two other frenchmen this 
week spoke of degrading treatment during their three years as 
hostages in lebanon but said the really brutal treatment was 
reserved for americans who tried to escape 
jeanpaul kauffmann 44 a reporter for the weekly evenement du 
jeudi recently shared a cell with american educator frank herbert 
reed who was mistreated to the point of being left prostrate 
kauffmanns sister mariegenevieve dagin was quoted as saying by 
agence francepresse 
reed was director of the lebanese international school when he 
was kidnapped on sept 9 1986 
mrs dagin was quoted by afp as saying kauffmann told her the 
american hostages held by the proiranian shiite moslem group 
islamic jihad were the object of brutality because they tried to 
escape 
the dispatch did not make clear if kauffmann specified which 
hostages were mistreated for attempting to get away 
kauffmann who was abducted may 22 1985 was freed in beirut on 
wednesday with french diplomats marcel carton and marcel fontaine 
who were kidnapped that same year all three arrived back in paris 
on thursday 
in his own interview friday with afp kauffmann said the 
remaining western hostages in lebanon were my main concern i ask 
their families to remain patient and stay confident 
nine americans are among 18 foreigners still missing in lebanon 
terry anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press is the longest held he was seized march 16 1985 
afp quoted kauffmann as saying the moslems holding foreign 
hostages often degraded their captives and took everything away 
from us even our first names some of our jailers were very 
human but in a very hard context the best alternated with the 
worst for reasons that escaped us 
he said the kidnappers gave each of the three french hostages a 
new name habib for carton najib for fontaine labib for 
kauffmann afp reported 
kauffmann identified abu ali as a particularly cruel guard the 
french agency said 
he left us in filth because for him we were impure he 
continued to humiliate us not to mention a mock execution in june 
1987 which was particularly frightening the french reporter was 
quoted as saying 
afp quoted the journalist as saying he was moved 18 times during 
his years of captivity and once was bound up like a mummy put in 
a sort of coffin under the bed of a truck and warned to stay silent 
or he would be executed 
kauffmann was also quoted as saying he read the novel war and 
peace 21 times during his captivity 
conservative premier jacques chirac on friday condemned those 
who try to insinuate that france made a deal with iran for the 
frenchmens freedom 
chirac who faces incumbent socialist francois mitterrand in a 
presidential runoff election sunday said i say solemnly i say 
on my honor that no negotiation no compromise no bargaining no 
deal took place with any foreign government or even less with any 
terrorist group 
afp citing unidentified sources it said were close to french 
negotiators said france and iran agreed to resume formal 
diplomatic relations under a 40day schedule beginning the day the 
hostages were freed 
france confirmed reports that onethird of a 1 billion loan 
iran made to france in 1974 has been paid other reports have said 
the remainder was being paid in return for freeing kauffmann 
carton and fontaine 
mrs dagin was quoted as saying in her interview that she 
learned from her brother that fontaine was briefly held with terry 
waite the special envoy of the archbishop of canterbury waite 
disappeared jan 20 1987 while in lebanon to seek the hostages 
release 
kauffmann mrs dagin was quoted as saying found no excuse 
for his kidnappers for whom he feels only hate

its all right with me said jim wright 
the house speaker and texas democrat im glad he consults 
somebody 
tongue firmly in cheek wright was referring to president 
reagans newly divulged fascination with astroloy which history 
says hitler and julius caesar also used in planning their strategy 
since these three leaders had very diverse aims its impossible 
to make a judgment whether heeding the position of the planets is a 
good or bad influence 
for sure though nearly everyone wants to know how presidents 
make their decisions wives often are suspected of having undue 
influence or a chief of staff or pokerplaying cronies or a 
kitchen cabinet 
suspecting wives of undue influence is not necessarily an 
expression of sexism since unlike vice presidents they are not 
elected the suspicion usually carries a suggestion of a glitch 
in the democratic process 
the same is true of chiefs of staff and friends of presidents 
sherman adams is supposed to have done a lot more than keep 
administrative order in the white house for dwight d eisenhower 
although the revisionist view is that ike really was running things 
critics of andrew jackson 160 years ago questioned his 
practice of sitting around the kitchen stove with old friends and 
swapping ideas with them the critics probably did not care much 
for this first commonman president anyhow 
curiously in the case of jimmy carter the critics wished he 
consulted more with washington wise men instead of old friends from 
georgia toward the end carter turned more to people like clark 
clifford and lloyd cutler so the critics found other things to 
complain about 
vice presidents on the other hand generally are not considered 
all that useful to the man in the white house 
two in recent history john nance garner and lyndon b johnson 
were credited with getting their running mates elected 
garner swung the texas delegation behind franklin d roosevelt 
while johnson is credited with winning texas and the presidency 
for john f kennedy 
otherwise presidents tend to look elsewhere for advice 
like to the stars 
and that raises questions in an age that prizes reason and 
science 
sixtytwo years ago when it turned out president calvin 
coolidge had a yen for astrology congress held a hearing 
harry houdini the renowned escape artist was called as a 
witness 
the results of the hearing are lost in history 
but reagans fascination with coolidge is wellknown reagan 
replaced harry trumans picture in the cabinet room with one of 
coolidge the former boston police commissioner who made 
presidential inaction an art form 
what did astrology do for reagan 
according to one unverified account the treaty banning us and 
soviet intermediaterange nuclear missiles was signed exactly at 
133 pm last dec 8 at the insistence of mrs reagan who 
evidently also fancies astrology 
her influence on the president has been a matter of persistent 
speculation inside the beltway ever since the reagans moved into 
the white house more than seven years ago 
it may be no coincidence that the astrology story originates 
with donald regan the former white house chief of staff whose 
relations with mrs reagan were not considered very warm 
rosalyn carter was supposed to have great influence on her 
husband jimmy although few doubted he had strong convictions of 
his own 
critics of roosevelt often suggested eleanor his wife steered 
him along liberal lines 
and after woodrow wilson suffered a stroke his wife edith was 
supposed to have played a leading role in presidential 
decisionmaking 
in fact the only president never accused of being the target of 
wifely inlfuence on his political career was james buchanan he 
also was the only bachelor president 
what motivates reagan for instance in making a speech accusing 
the soviets of aggression and another two weeks later praising 
their human rights reforms maybe mrs reagan the stars his own 
convictions and sense of history 
its hard to say

teamsters president jackie presser 
hospitalized for a new round of cancer treatments is taking a 
leave of absence from his job just two months before his scheduled 
trial on racketeering and embezzlement charges 
presser 61 has told the 20 other members of the unions 
executive board that he will be temporarily unavailable for the 
next 120 days because of his health his attorney john climaco 
said thursday 
climaco said presser is hospitalized at the cleveland clinic in 
ohio where he is undergoing a new round of radiation treatments 
during the periods of his treatments and for a period of time 
afterwards he has been advised to rest and avoid all forms of 
stress the attorney said 
union officials declined to describe pressers condition further 
the rotund teamsters president underwent surgery in january 1987 
for lung cancer and has not returned to work full time since then 
while undergoing a series of radiation and chemotherapy treatments 
however he has made several appearances at various union 
functions including the aflcios convention last october at which 
he gave a rambling speech on the teamsters reaffiliation with the 
labor federation after a 30year absence 
the 16 millionmember union will be directed during pressers 
leave by secretarytreasurer weldon l mathis regarded as a 
possible successor to the teamsters presidency union officials 
said 
presser is expected to keep receiving his salary in various 
union positions now about 600000 annually the officials said 
when asked if presser would seek another delay of his trial on 
federal charges in connection with an alleged payrollpadding 
scheme at a teamsters local in cleveland that he also heads 
climaco answered not necessarily 
the trial already postponed several times because of pressers 
health is scheduled to open in us district court in cleveland on 
july 12 
mr presser is looking forward to his july trial and hopes he 
will be physically able to stand trial so that he can once and for 
all vindicate himself the lawyer said 
presser is accused of participating in a scheme in which two men 
with alleged organized crime ties were placed on the cleveland

from 1985 through 1987 they were taperecorded and made available 
for sale at a store run by followers of nation of islam leader 
louis farrakhan 
in the lectures cokely who like the mayor is black had said

slaves to america and called columbus day a white supremacist

a new sedative that was touted as a superior 
substitute for valium was marketed in doses that were too strong 
and sometimes fatal doctors told a house panel examining the drug 
versed 
its a wonderful drug when it works but the risks are too 
great plastic surgeon dr michael morrisey told the house 
government operations subcommittee on human resources 
morisey who said a patient of his died after receiving the 
drug said thursday that doctors are shying away from versed 
because of the risks the drug is basically out of their 
control he said 
versed sold in the united states since march 1986 is used 
intravenously for both full anesthesia and conscious sedation 
for diagnostic procedures often performed in a doctors office 
the food and drug administration has received reports of 42 
deaths associated with versed but doctors and an fda official said 
the actual count is probably higher 
the maker of the drug hoffmannla roche inc declined to 
testify at the hearing but dr bruce medd its vice president and 
director of professional services in a telephone interview 
defended versed 
fifteen million people have gotten versed since march 1986 
medd said if this was a major problem we would certainly be 
talking about more than 42 fatalities 
the doctors at the hearing complained that versed was marketed 
here at doses two to three times as high as in britain despite 
existing studies that showed the lower doses were safe and 
effective 
the europeans were lightyears ahead of us in understanding 
that versed is much stronger than valium said dr robert julien a 
portland ore anesthesiologist 
dr alan lisbon an anesthesia professor at harvard medical 
school said six studies showing that low doses were effective were 
published before the fda approved versed he said the fda didnt 
use them but britain did in setting its lower dose level 
rep ted weiss dny chairman of the subcommittee called the 
initial us dose levels dangerously excessive and criticized 
the fda for failing to review all scientific literature before it 
approved the drug 
he also charged that hoffmannla roche did not promptly report 
to the fda important safetyrelated information including deaths 
associated with the drug that could have led to quick revision of 
the recommended dose 
unfortunately it appears that many of the safety problems 
presented by versed were preventable weiss said 
a statement issued by new jerseybased hoffmannlaroche said all 
the allegations against it would prove unfounded and said it had 
complied with all regulations on reporting of information to the 
fda 
dr carlton peck director of the fdas center for drug 
evaluation and research said the fda had responsibly evaluated the 
data on versed and acted promptly in response to reports of adverse 
reactions he said he was not aware of any information withheld by 
the manufacturer 
as for the testimony of the doctors peck commented i cant 
make any assessment of its credibility theres a lot of 
opinion and a sizable amount of hearsay being expressed 
some of the doctors said the drugs packaging and recommended 
doses were intended to make it seem comparable to valium although 
the manufacturer already knew it was up to four times as strong 
they said revised dosage information was delayed and then buried 
in obscure materials they also complained that the drug had no 
margin of safety that an extra milligram could send a mildly 
sedated patient into a coma 
advertising as far back as october 1986 noted the revised 
potency level medd said but the fda did not approve revised 
labeling until may 1987 and doctors did not receive a redflagged 
letter about lower dose levels until november 1987 
that got my attention but it was too late said dr douglas 
walta of portland ore he said one of his patients died during a 
kidney exam last may

alaska is the pacesetter and south dakota 
brings up the rear when it comes to salaries for public school 
teachers the national education association says 
classroom teachers now earn an average of 28031 nationally 
the union said thursday with salaries ranging from 40424 in 
alaska down to 19750 in south dakota 
alaska is one of nine states plus the district of columbia 
where the typical teacher earns more than 30000 a year only 
south dakota fell below 20000 
the average classroom teacher with 15 years of experience got 
a 56 percent pay raise last year that boosted his or her salary by 
1477 from the 198687 level of 26554 
the roster of toppaying states includes such populous ones as 
new york california and michigan and that will help push the 
national average teacher salary closer to 30000 in the year ahead 
the teachers group did not estimate how much salaries will rise 
this fall but if teachers get another 56 percent increase they 
will be earning 29600 for the 198889 school year 
teacher salaries have risen sharply in the 1980s amid widespread 
concern about lagging standards in the classroom and waning 
interest among college students in entering the profession 
recently however with starting salaries topping 20000 in some 
places interest in teaching has picked up 
secretary of education william j bennett in a critique last 
week on the impact of school reforms said teacher salaries have 
risen 20 percent after adjusting for inflation since 198081 
but the nea said that over the past decade including the steep 
inflation years of the late 1970s teacher salaries are up only 73 
percent after inflation 
the union said there are 2275209 classroom teachers in the 
public schools 25251 more than in 198687 
the entire instructional staff including principals 
supervisors and specialists numbered 2589148 that was up by 
30190 or 12 percent the average salary for all instructors was 
29203 up 53 percent from 27722 last year 
most teachers work on nine or 10month contracts 
eighteen states and the district of columbia pay teachers more 
than the national average 32 states pay less 
nea researchers said the 28031 figure is an estimate based on 
salary data compiled from all 50 state 
although only an estimate the nea salary figure is widely 
cited including by the us department of education as the most 
accurate indicator of how much school teachers earn it includes 
salaries of teachers represented by the rival american federation 
of teachers as well those represented by nea 
the nea gave this breakdown of average salaries and pay 
increases for classroom teachers since 197778 when salaries 
averaged 14198 
197879 15032 59 percent 
197980 15970 62 percent 
198081 17644 105 percent 
198182 19274 92 percent 
198283 20695 74 percent 
198384 21921 59 percent 
198485 23593 76 percent 
198586 25198 68 percent 
198687 26554 53 percent

pope john paul ii starts his ninth trip to 
south america on saturday a visit expected to focus on the 
pontiffs campaign against drugs and poverty in the overwhelmingly 
roman catholic continent 
john pauls 12day itinerary will take him to uruguay and peru 
both for the second time to impoverished bolivia high in the 
andes and to a meeting in paraguay with strongman gen alfredo 
stroessner 
the tour john pauls 37th foreign pilgrimage since he became 
pope nine years ago is a sign of the importance the vatican gives 
to an area expected to include half of the worlds roman catholics 
by the end of the century the trip also leaves cuba as the only 
major country in the region not visited by the polishborn pope 
it will be a new test of the fitness of john paul who will turn 
68 while in paraguay on may 18 in addition to keeping to his usual 
grueling schedule and delivering 60 speeches he will make two 
stops in the 2milehigh altitudes of bolivia 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said the popes doctors 
advised him to consider slowing down his pace at that altitude but 
that john paul replied how can i do that 
the popes first stop is uruguay considered the most secular 
country in the region 
john paul then makes a fiveday tour of bolivia that will 
include a stop in santa cruz an eastern city where cocaine 
traffickers are said to operate with near impunity 
a us congressional committee recently accused bolivia peru 
and paraguay of failing to give the united states full cooperation 
in the war on drugs the house foreign affairs committee voted to 
impose aid sanctions the legislation was considered unlikely to 
pass before a may 13 deadline 
the pope who on his 1985 trip to peru noted that andean natives 
have traditionally used coca leaves to ward off fatigue and hunger 
is expected to denounce the international problem of cocaine 
smuggling 
in a special edition on the upcoming trip the vatican newspaper 
called bolivia one of the most tormented countries in south 
america because of its economic and social problems and said that 
drug trafficking was eroding and polluting all levels of 
society 
after bolivia the pope travels to the peruvian capital of lima 
to deliver the closing address to a regional religious conference 
church officials said that from his jet window as he nears 
limas airport the pontiff will be greeted with papa paz or 
pope peace a giant sign made of white flowers set in a 
25acre potato patch 
the greeting is a play on words since papa is the spanish 
word for both pope and the potato officials said the pope who 
speaks spanish fluently will readily understand the message 
church officials expect about 2 million people to attend mass in 
a seaside field with a 115foot illuminated cross 
in paraguay the pope is scheduled to meet with stroessner on may 
16 when he arrives in the capital of asuncion 
stroessner who came to power in an army coup in 1954 was 
recently reelected to an eighth presidential term with an 
officially announced 886 percent of the vote opposition 
politicians claimed the election was rigged 
during his visit to chile in 1987 john paul came under 
criticism for meeting with the countrys authoritarian ruler gen 
augusto pinochet 
the vatican bristles at any suggestion that such meetings imply 
the popes support for a particular person or policy 
he the pope doesnt consecrate any person or system said 
navarro he goes to visit the people 
the pope is scheduled to return to rome on may 19

farm workers living illegally in the united 
states could get a boost in their efforts to prove theyre eligible 
for amnesty under a judges ruling thursday 
us district judge lawrence k karlton ordered the immigration 
and naturalization service to develop regulations for subpoenaing 
records from employers of seasonal farmworkers applying for legal 
residency 
a lawsuit filed by the united farm workers charged that many 
laborers are being unfairly denied a chance for citizenship because 
of problems with proving they live and work in this country 
the ins requires undocumented farm workers to submit documents 
such as pay stubs to back up their claims that they picked 
perishable crops for at least 90 days in recent years 
but aliens who previously tried to avoid a paper trail for fear 
of deportation are finding farmers arent always willing to back 
them up in writing said attorneys for the union 
the employers are saying well youre not working for me 
now i dont owe you anything i didnt like the way you worked for 
me anyway i dont want to bother or im going to charge you 
25 said stephen rosenbaum an attorney with california rural 
legal assistance 
the ufw is seeking to loosen immigration regulations allowing 
farm workers simply to submit a written statement and putting the 
burden on the ins to prove them wrong 
karlton held off on ruling on that request but issued a 
preliminary injunction ordering the ins regulations for issuing 
subpoenas against reluctant employers 
on tuesday the judge voided a rule that made aliens ineligible 
for legalization if they left the united states since november 1986 
on thursday he suggested he may narrow the impact of that 
ruling i just sort of dropped my teeth and issued an order where 
im going to have to issue another order and say who im talking 
about karlton said 
he scheduled a june 2 hearing on a motion to compel the ins to 
extend the amnesty deadline for those affected 
wednesday was the deadline for illegal aliens who have lived in 
the united states since jan 1 1982 to apply for amnesty 
seasonal farm workers who picked perishable crops for at least 90 
days in the year ending may 1 1986 have until nov 30 
government attorneys said the the impact of the subpoena ruling 
was small because ins already uses its subpoena power 
we dont think theres much difference its not any different 
from whats happening now said greg hollows deputy chief of 
civil divisions in the us attorneys office in sacramento 
but rosenbaum said the decision is significant because ins 
officials infrequently issue subpoenas to help workers get 
documents from growers 
they may still make people jump through hoops in order to get 
them he said but i certainly think it is more than an 
academic victory

government lawyers are reviewing allegations 
of impropriety by attorney general edwin meese iii and possible 
perjury by other officials in the case of a company that says it 
was pushed into bankruptcy by the justice department 
one of the issues is whether meese interceded with inslaw incs 
law firm and whether that had anything to do with the subsequent 
dismissal of the lawyer representing the company 
the justice departments public integrity section also is 
reviewing conflicts in the sworn testimony of two former federal 
bankruptcy trustees and two justice department officials during 
bankruptcy court proceedings involving inslaw according to sources 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the testimony dealt with inslaws allegations that justice 
department officials sought to put the company out of business by 
trying unsuccessfully to convert its bankruptcy reorganization to 
an outright liquidation 
independent counsel james c mckay who is conducting a criminal 
investigation of meese in several areas is not probing the inslaw 
case but did refer information about it to the public integrity 
section 
we are not conducting an investigation with respect to the 
inslaw matter said carol bruce mckays deputy any 
information we have received relating to it we have referred to the 
justice departments public integrity section 
but the section after reviewing the material could return it 
to mckays office for a fuller investigation of the meese 
allegation according to a source familiar with the case 
inslaw attorneys told mckay that the companys original lawyer 
leigh ratiner was fired from his washington law firm after meese 
discussed the case with leonard garment a politically connected 
partner in the same firm 
the justice department acknowledged to inslaw in pretrial 
discovery that meese recalled talking to garment about the case in 
the fall of 1986 
ratiner was soon asked to leave the law firm of dickstein 
shapiro amp morin inslaw says in court papers that ratiner was told 
garment was instrumental in the decision to ask him to leave 
garment called the allegation pure baloney but acknowledged 
that he was questioned about it two months ago by publicintegrity 
investigators the current status of the meese investigation could 
not immediately be determined 
the perjury investigation involves sworn depositions or 
courtroom testimony given by witnesses in connection with inslaws 
allegation that the justice department tried to force inslaw into a 
liquidation proceeding in bankruptcy court 
inslaw alleged that justice department officials deliberately 
withheld 177 million in payments on a 10 million contract the 
company had signed in 1982 to computerize 94 us attorneys 
offices 
us bankruptcy judge george f bason jr found in inslaws 
favor and ordered the justice department to pay the company 68 
million after ruling that government officials engaged in 
trickery fraud and deceit to steal the companys software the 
department is appealing 
conversion of the case from a chapter 11 reorganization to a 
chapter 7 liquidation would have put inslaw out of business under 
chapter 11 protection from creditors inslaw has been able to 
reorganize and build up clients while arranging to pay off its 
debts 
cornelius blackshear a federal bankruptcy judge in new york 
city gave a sworn deposition last year that when he was a us 
trustee in 1985 he was asked to help liquidate inslaw by thomas j 
stanton head of the justice departments executive office of us 
trustees 
but a day after he was deposed blackshear signed an affidavit 
recanting the testimony saying he had confused inslaw with another 
bankruptcy matter 
blackshear then gave a second deposition that was consistent 
with the affidavit 
in his ruling last year bason expressed disbelief about 
blackshears recantation although he called it an honest 
mistake 
i believe that judge blackshears original testimony is 
accurate and his recanted testimony is inaccurate bason said 
the judge noted that blackshear changed his initial testimony 
after receiving telephone calls from william c white then us 
bankruptcy trustee in alexandria va 
white denied allegations that the justice department pressured 
him to file a motion to liquidate inslaw to which bason said that 
people do have a capacity to forget things when it is painful for 
them to remember or maybe even inconvenient for them to 
remember 
bason said whites testimony was contrary to other credible 
evidence 
bason also rejected stantons sworn denials saying i found 
mr stantons testimony in crucial respects to be evasive and 
unbelievable at another point he said stantons testimony was 
utterly incredible and unworthy of belief 
neither blackshear stanton nor white returned a reporters 
telephone messages 
the public integrity section is reviewing the testimony of 
blackshear stanton white and anthony f pasciuto who recently 
resigned as deputy director of the trustees office the sources 
said 
pasciuto has provided fresh allegations that blackshears 
recantation was false 
in a letter by his lawyer to the justice department pasciuto 
alleged that blackshear admitted to him last summer that the 
recantation was false 
i felt the easiest thing i could do was recant pasciuto 
quotes blackshear as saying i felt less people would be hurt if 
i just bailed out 
pasciutos lawyer gary simpson wrote the letter to thendeputy 
attorney general arnold burns to protest justice department efforts 
to fire his client for violating regulations by meeting with inslaw 
president william hamilton and hamiltons wife nancy 
pasciuto was allowed to resign and has joined a private 
financial firm in new york 
during the meeting pasciuto told the hamiltons about pressure 
from stanton to liquidate their company but in court testimony 
pascuito said his statements to the hamiltons were fabricated 
made up to injure stanton for delaying a longawaited promotion 
told of the investigation pasciutos lawyer said tony 
pasciuto has the documentation that many of the things he was 
saying were true 
bason concluded that stanton sought to liquidate inslaw to 
curry favor with justice department officials following a 
conversation with c madison brewer who administered the inslaw 
contract 
brewer previously worked for inslaw but was fired and the judge 
concluded that brewer was consumed by hatred and an intense 
desire for revenge 
the departments office of professional responsibility is 
investigating brewers conduct

a houseapproved amendment to the defense 
spending bill calls for using american military might to halt the 
flow of illegal drugs but the measure faces pentagon opposition 
and review by a conference committee 
by a 38523 vote thursday the house adopted a measure ordering 
the president to deploy equipment and personnel of the armed 
forces sufficient to halt the unlawful penetration of united states 
borders by aircraft and vessels carrying narcotics 
the house passed similar antidrug amendments in 1985 and 1986 
but they were later eliminated by conference committees among the 
obstacles this time around is opposition from defense secretary 
frank c carlucci 
that is not a function of the military carlucci said in an 
interview earlier this year we are not the frontline agency in 
the war on drugs 
carlucci was interviewed after education secretary william 
bennett had raised the possbility in a speech 
house members admitted thursday that the amendment has 
shortcomings yes it is flawed said rep jack davis rill 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee agreed this thing has serious problems he said 
aspin had proposed adding 350 million to the bill for the coast 
guard which has cut antidrug patrols by 55 percent because of 
budget problems 
the money would be used to pay for more coast guard patrols 
along with buying six more patrol helicopters six patrol boats 
and a pair of radar aircraft to track smugglers 
davis and other republicans raised the total to 475 million and 
added the amendment ordering the military to seal american borders 
the house also voted thursday to spend 600 million for research 
into the singlewarhead midgetman weapon that the reagan 
administration wants to kill 
the message here is that there is a lot of support for 
midgetman said rep les aucoin dore speaking shortly before 
the 231171 vote 
aucoins plan proposes only 100 million for the railroadbased 
version of the 10warhead mx president reagan wants 50 of those 
missiles to go with 50 more mx weapons that will be put into 
landbased silos 
reagan had sought only 200 million for the midgetman and 793 
million for the railbased mx 
the senate will begin work next week on its version of the 
pentagon budget and that measure proposes only 50 million for 
midgetman and 700 million for mx differences between the two 
bills will be worked out by a housesenate conference committee 
in addition to being opposed by the reagan administration the 
midgetman is also opposed by both active candidates for the 
democratic presidential nomination michael dukakis and jesse 
jackson 
but candidates can change their mind aspin said he noted 
that reagan originally opposed basing the mx on railroads but now 
supports that plan 
the dispute involves a successor to the aging minuteman as the 
heart of americas landbased nuclear deterrent a triad which also 
includes submarinelaunched missiles and bombers 
supporters of the mx say it has already been developed and would 
be much cheaper to simply build 50 more and put them on railroads 
but midgetman backers contend the mx is vulnerable to a soviet 
first strike and nuclear stability would be improved by building a 
weapon that has fewer warheads and thus is less attractive as a 
target 
in another defense issue carlucci said congressional demands 
that americas allies pay more for defense are misguided and amount 
to a highstakes game of chicken that the united states cant 
afford to play 
carlucci addressing the foreign policy association in new york 
city said recent attacks in congress on nato and other allies like 
japan and south korea suggest a growing inclination towards 
isolationism a kind of withdrawal syndrome from our international 
obligations and interests

legislation that would further embarrass 
eastern airlines by prodding the transportation department to 
expand its investigation of the troubled carrier is on its way to 
the house 
the house public works and transportation committee approved a 
resolution on thursday urging the department to widen its probe of 
eastern and its parent company texas air corp 
the nonbinding measure was approved by a voice vote garnering 
support from committee members of both parties it is not certain 
when the measure will be considered by the full house where 210 
lawmakers almost half the membership are already cosponsors 
management at texas air and eastern is locked in a lengthy 
battle with the airlines unions that has spilled into congress 
the courts and the news media 
company executives have sought a number of steps including 
wage concessions to stem a huge tide of red ink and have said 
the congressional resolution is merely a ploy by the unions but 
labor leaders say managements real goal is to destroy the unions 
and that a study of the companys leadership and its operations is 
justified 
i dont think were being led by our nose because of a 
labormanagement problem said rep norman mineta dcalif the 
resolutions original sponsor were being driven by safety 
considerations 
rep john paul hammerschmidt of arkansas ranking republican on 
the committee also supported the measure as a statement of 
support for the transportation department probe 
the transportation department announced last month that it had 
begun investigating the management financial status and safety 
practices of texas air eastern and another texas air subsidiary 
continental airlines the federal aviation administration is also 
inspecting eastern and continental planes 
the nonbinding resolution approved thursday urges the 
department to widen its investigation by looking more closely at 
how texas air and eastern practices affect the public and company 
employees it also seeks to have the department use its findings in 
deciding whether to allow texas air to make future operating 
changes such as selling the eastern air shuttle 
after the vote capt john knudson a spokesman for easterns 
unionized pilots said the resolution would send a mandate to the 
department of transportation and the faa to ensure a full and 
public airing of the issues 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak speaking from company 
headquarters in miami said the measure was part of the unions 
campaign to lobby congress discredit eastern and frighten away 
customers 
a similar resolution in the senate has 14 cosponsors 
meanwhile at the us court of appeals eastern asked a panel 
of judges to overturn a lower courts ruling that blocks the 
airline from selling its profitable bostonnew yorkwashington air 
shuttle service the court reserved judgment

an agriculture department quarantine ordered a 
month ago in 13 states to stop the spread of destructive bee mites 
was canceled today because it proved to be unworkable and too 
costly 
the states are florida illinois maine michigan mississippi 
nebraska new york ohio pennsylvania south carolina south 
dakota washington and wisconsin 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said thursday the restrictions are 
being lifted effective today on the movement of bees and 
equipment from those states 
although not known to be harmful to other creatures the mites 
are considered a major threat to the nations honey and beekeeping 
industry 
the tiny killer mites varroa jacobsoni were first discovered 
in the united states last september in a wisconsin apiary they 
since have spread to the other states 
information received from state governments beekeepers 
growers and researchers has caused us to conclude that the 
regulatory program established under the quarantine is not the 
appropriate mechanism to contain the interstate spread of varroa 
mites glosser said 
the original purpose of the quarantines was to issue permits for 
outofstate movement of only bees and equipment found to be free 
of the mites 
however weve found that the requirements under the 
quarantine are not uniformly appropriate or workable because the 
role of honeybees in the agricultural economy varies widely from 
state to state glosser said many beekeepers have found it 
impossible to comply with the regulations and still meet their own 
deadlines 
for example he said a beehive might have to be moved out of 
its home state several times a year treating a hive against mites 
requires 21 days which is longer than most beehives are scheduled 
to stay in a state when they are moved for pollination purposes 
beekeeping is credited by usda with the pollination of many 
agricultural crops having an estimated annual value of around 20 
billion those include many fruits vegetables and hay crops 
glosser said other factors weighed on the decision to cancel the 
quarantines including a shortage of treatment materials and 
limited state and federal resources to conduct and coordinate 
surveys and inspections 
the movement of hundreds of thousands of hives and other 
regulated articles tends to occur during short periods in the 
spring and fall intensifying the demand for inspection services 
beyond the limits of current federal and state resources he said 
the varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their 
developing larvae or brood it causes decreased brood deformed 
bees and a weakening of the colonys ability to pollinate plants 
and produce honey infestation can occur so gradually that the 
mites may not be noticed until severe damage is done 
glosser said his agency will continue to coordinate the 
collection of survey information about the mite 
we feel however that state governments producers and 
beekeepers can best tailor varroa mite detection control and other 
measures to the needs of their particular state he said

the agriculture department says record large 
supplies of red meat and poultry for the sixth straight year are 
expected to chew into the financial returns of livestock producers 
in 1988 
although that is not good news for producers the huge supplies 
will help hold down meat and poultry prices at the retail level 
reduced beef supplies are being more than offset by increased 
volumes of pork and poultry the departments economic research 
service said thursday feed costs are rising due to expanding 
exports increased domestic use and reduced production 
poultry output is being led by an expected 5 percent increase in 
broiler production with most of the increase coming in the first 
half of the year 
commercial pork production rose 7 percent from a year earlier in 
the first quarter of 1988 reflecting a gradual increase by hog 
producers production is expected to be up 10 percent in the second 
quarter from a year earlier 8 percent in the third and about even 
in the fourth 
returns to hog producers may fall to near breakeven before 
the third quarter ends the agency reported and negative 
returns are possible in the fall 
beef production will likely rise above yearearlier levels in 
the second quarter because of more feedlot cattle going to 
slaughter at heavier weights 
returns above cash costs for cowcalf producers are expected 
to remain positive in 1988 but returns to great plains cattle 
feeders may turn negative during the late spring and summer the 
report said

a proposal for random drug testing of railroad 
workers should be sidetracked by the courts which have already 
stopped a program of testing train crews after accidents the 
attorney for railway unions says 
this really smacks of chutzpah said lawrence mann 
attorney for the railway labor executives association an umbrella 
group for 20 unions mann said thursday the group opposes any plan 
that puts a burden on workers without reasonable suspicion of a 
violation 
rail labor will be given its due process by the federal 
railroad administration and then theyll tell us where to go he 
said he predicted the issue would end up in the courts 
the proposal to compel railroads to begin random drug tests of 
workers in positions affecting public safety was announced at a 
news conference thursday by secretary of transportation jim burnley 
at the same time burnley said the department was moving to 
crack down on drunken driving by commercial bus and truck drivers 
with the threat of license losses for firsttime offenders 
burnley said he grew tried of waiting for congress to enact 
random drug testing which he said would play a major role in 
ridding the nations railroads of illegal drugs 
a rail safety bill that includes a random drug testing provision 
has stalled in a housesenate conference committee 
burnley also used the news conference to announce the proposed 
crackdown on drunk driving by bus and truck drivers 
under the new standard which states would be expected to adopt 
in coming years firsttime violators would be subject to a 
oneyear loss of their commercial drivers licenses if found to 
have an alcohol concentration of 004 percent or more a second 
citation would mean a lifetime suspension 
the strict 004 standard is significantly below the 010 
figure now set by most states as the level for under the 
influence crimimal penalties burnley said 
while it still would be up to the states to take action against 
the drivers the states could lose some highway aid money beginning 
in 1993 if they do not adopt the stricter standard 
burnley said the tougher standard was warranted because of the 
larger vehicles that commercial operators drive and the amount of 
time they spend behind the wheel 
the steps announced thursday follow by two months a dot plan of 
drug testing for all employees in sensitive safety and 
securityrelated positions in the aviation industry 
random drug testing of railroad workers would complement the 
existing system of testing train crews involved in major accidents 
that program has continued while the reagan administration appeals 
a federal court ruling on feb 11 that declared such testing 
unconstitutional 
burnley said he was confident the supreme court would uphold 
postaccident testing 
but even if the high court does side with dot federal railroad 
administrator john riley said random drug testing was a necessary 
complement to existing rules 
the success of a reasonablecause drugtesting program is 
dependent on the supervisors ability to detect symptoms riley 
said unfortunately many drugs in use today can impair an 
engineers judgment without producing symptoms recognizable to even 
a trained layman random testing isnt keyed to observable 
symptoms and the users know that 
under the proposal railroads would have to establish random 
urine testing programs for marijuana cocaine opiates 
amphetamines and pcp 
of 179 train accidents during 1987 tests found at least one 
positive drug or alcohol finding in 37

a monet pencil sketch stolen from brigham 
young universitys art collection nearly two decades ago has been 
returned a university spokesman said 
two women in a boat valued at 100000 to 250000 was 
among more than 1000 art works worth some 3 million found to be 
missing when the schools 12000piece collection was inventoried 
in 1986 
university police recovered the sketch also known as the boat 
ride from an unidentified collector in new york school 
spokesman brent harker said thursday 
the collector voluntarily relinquished the piece which had been 
purchased from an auction house 
the monet and two sketches by winslow homer the shepherdess 
and over the garden wall were taken from the university for 
authentication in 1969 by dion owyatt a new york art dealer 
harker said 
owyatt however sold the three pieces but had forgeries made 
of two women in a boat and the shepherdess and gave them to 
brigham young harker said 
university officials discovered the forgeries and realized that 
over the garden wall was missing during the inventory harker 
said 
owyatt pleaded no contest in november to theft by deception in 
connection with the three missing sketches and was given a 
suspended jail term and fine provided he help return the original 
works harker said 
the original the shepherdess was recovered in december but 
the owner of over the garden wall refused to relinquish the 
sketch and the university has hired an attorney to try to recover 
it harker said 
harker described the three sketches as the crown jewels of 
the missing art works 
wes burnside a byu art professor and curator of the collection 
from 1973 until his retirement in 1983 was accused by byu 
officials of involvement in the disappearance of the art works 
most of which are believed to have been stolen improperly traded 
or sold between 1972 and 1978 
burnside pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge in exchange for 
immunity from prosecution and in march was named a defendant in a 
civil suit aimed at recovering the missing pieces 
harker said the sketch brings to about 60 the number of art 
works recovered and that university officials know the whereabouts 
of about 140 more and are seeking their return

two weeks before the head of the small 
business administration was fired in 1982 edwin meese iii was told 
by wedtech corp consultant e robert wallach that the sba chief 
was the central figure in deciding whether wedtech got a lucrative 
nobid contract 
apparently the key figure at this particular moment is frank 
cardenas the director of the sba wallach wrote thenwhite house 
counselor meese in a jan 21 1982 memo released thursday by a 
senate subcommittee if my information is correct this may be the 
last step and cardenas is the key figure 
the sba administrator at that time was michael cardenas 
a few days earlier cardenas and his deputy david gonzales had 
decided not to sign off on the wedtech contract until army 
officials were satisfied with terms and conditions according to a 
report by the senate subcommittee 
cardenas and gonzales have said that at a jan 15 1982 meeting 
they resisted suggestions by white house aides pier talenti and 
henry zuniga that wedtech receive the 32 million contract to build 
small engines for the army 
cardenas was dismissed by the white house on feb 5 1982 on 
grounds of incompetence and gonzales was forced out with him 
the senate subcommittee reached no conclusions as to whether 
cardenas was fired because of the wedtech contract or whether 
wallachs memo to meese alerted the white house counselor to the 
situation 
cardenas replacement james sanders later arranged for wedtech 
to get the work army officials felt the companys price was too 
high but their concerns were quieted when sba agreed to make 
several million dollars available in advance payments and business 
and development expenses 
wallach now under indictment for alleged racketeering in the 
wedtech scandal has been a friend of meeses for 30 years 
copies of 16 memos by wallach to meese including the one dated 
jan 21 1982 were released by the senate subcommittee on 
oversight of government management on wednesday the panel 
released a report concluding that meese and his deputy james 
jenkins had violated a white house policy barring participation in 
individual contracts resulting in improper favoritism toward 
wedtech 
according to wallachs jan 21 memo cardenas had the power to 
return the contract to the army for competitive bidding or to keep 
it under an sba setaside program for minorityrun firms

political extremist lyndon larouche says a 
federal jury in boston would have acquitted him and his associates 
of conspiracy charges if the judge had not declared a mistrial 
there was no case larouche said at a news conference 
thursday in washington the case was a political fraud and a hoax 
from the beginning 
he cited a story in thursdays editions of the boston herald 
that quoted one juror as saying there was too much question of 
government misconduct in what was happening in the larouche 
campaign 
the newspaper reported that the 14 jurors held a surprise 
vote in the jury room after they were excused from the case on 
wednesday and that they voted unanimously to acquit larouche and 
his aides 
assistant us attorney john markham who handled the 
governments case could not be reached for comment 
prosecutors in the case said wednesday that they would press for 
a new trial of larouche six aides and five affiliated 
organizations on charges they raised money for larouches 1984 
presidential campaign through credit card and loan fraud 
larouche a candidate for the 1988 democratic nomination for 
president and his aides also are charged with conspiring to stymie 
a grand jury investigation of the alleged fraud 
larouche defies traditional political labels espousing views of 
global conspiracies and future calamities 
at his news conference he predicted that the us economy would 
plunge into depression within the next year and that if another 
democrat were elected president he would turn to larouche for 
guidance and a possible cabinet post 
larouche denied that defense attorneys had tried to slow down 
the boston trial which began on dec 17 1987 and contended that 
the us attorneys office in recent weeks had tried to delay the 
trial to get a mistrial in order to prevent an acquittal 
larouche contended that defense attorneys had pushed to have a 
pretrial hearing into defense allegations of government misconduct 
and infiltration of larouche groups but larouche said government 
attorneys balked instead keeton halted the trial two months ago 
for the hearing 
during the proceedings the government declassified a memo in 
which retired air force maj richard secord told thennational 
security council aide oliver north about an associates effort to 
get info against larouche 
a search of fbi files based on that disclosure led to the 
discovery of another classified document in which three 
intelligence operatives said toplevel cia and fbi officials had 
asked them to infiltrate larouche groups

a humanlike creature that became extinct more 
than a million years ago was not all thumbs after all a 
scientist claims in a study published today 
in fact says randall l susman of the state university of new 
york at stony brook the smallbrained hominid called paranthropus 
robustus had fingers and thumbs that were easily capable of turning 
bones and rocks into tools during the era almost 2 million years 
ago that the ancestors of modern humans were evolving the same 
skills 
susman an expert in primate anatomy said most experts on early 
humanlike animals believe that only the genus homo the ancestors 
of modern humans could make tools but after examining fossils 
unearthed in south africa susman said he believes that 
paranthropus robustus also was a toolmaker and in fact could have 
taught our ancestors this skill 
paranthropus robustus apparently emerged in africa about 25 
million years ago the species did not evolve further as did the 
ancestors of mankind and became extinct about 14 million years 
ago susman said many experts have long believed that one reason 
this largetoothed creature became extinct was that it could not 
use tools 
the experts says susman were not giving proper credit to the 
skills and dexterity of paranthropus robustus the proof he said 
is in the thumb 
fossils dug up at swartkrans in south africa and dated from 
about 18 million years ago show that paranthropus robustus had a 
very humanlike thumb said susman 
the paranthropus thumb like the human hand was capable of 
precision grasping and not just the power grasping of the 
lower primates he said 
precision grasping and power grasping require two different 
types of anatomy said susman power grasping is the type used 
when lifting a heavy suitcase or when doing a chin up the fingers 
become a hooklike grip and the thumb is just tucked out of the way 
precision grasp is the way you would pick up a raisin or the 
way you would thread a needle said susman precision grasp 
requires pulp to pulp contact between thumb and index finger power 
grasp doesnt when we look at hand anatomy we can see that 
humans have unmistakable hallmarks of precision grasp 
so did paranthropus according to susman 
the fossils show that the paranthropus thumb was connected to a 
saddle joint that was able to direct the thumb around to touch 
the pads on each of the finger tips it is a skill that only humans 
have 
a chimpanzee cannot rotate its thumb around said susman 
when it picks up a grape it does it in the same way that we 
would turn a key in a lock a pinch of the thumb against the side 
of the index finger 
because of this finding susman believes the popular belief 
about paranthropus robustus that it died out because it could not 
make tools is wrong 
the explanation why paranthropus became extinct is probably 
more subtle and complicated than we think said susman it is 
possible that some environmental change took place and the 
paranthropus was not able to adapt as well as the largerbrained 
homo genus 
susman said tools have been found with the fossils of 
paranthropus robustus in african digs where there are no remains 
from the homo genus at the swartkrans dig however about 10 
percent of the fossils have been identified as from the homo genus 
susman believes that the tools found there have the best chance of 
being made and used by paranthropus robustus which makes up about 
90 percent of the humanlike fossils found on the site 
these fossils were unearthed about five years ago and susman is 
the first anatomy expert to examine them 
eric delson a professor of anthropology at the college of the 
city of new york also has examined the fossils and believes susman 
is correct that they represent the hands of a toolmaker 
but delson said it has not been proven positively that the 
fossils are in fact those of paranthropus robustus 
the tools could be from the homo species said delson 
delson also argues that susman may be premature about his 
conclusions on the effect of tool making on the two humanlike 
species 
all of this is inferential and i think he is making too much 
of his inferences said delson 
susmans study was published today in science the journal of 
the american association for the advancement of science

a screenwriter revisits people and places from 
his past in no time flat a sliceoflife drama in which the 
sharpness of the slice is softened by a dreamlike quality 
the play the seventh by larry ketron to be produced by the wpa 
theater is very well acted especially by daniel ahearn in the 
lead role of calter the screenwriter whose manner is more southern 
country than hollywood 
the story begins with calters return to the carolinas where 
his oldest friend a policeman is hospitalized after being shot in 
the chest calter talks in the hospital waiting room with his 
friends wife played by linda cook who has appeared on the 
television soap operas all my children and edge of night 
calter goes to visit an old girlfriend and meets her daughter 
carolina sandra bullock a laidback teenager who announces 
shell drive to new york with him there calter tries to visit 
another old girlfriend finds she has moved from where she was 25 
years ago but does visit an old vietnam buddy played by paul 
geier 
the buddies meandering conversation is the weakest part of the 
play there is the inevitable blaming of the writer for being a 
spectator instead of a participant in life 
but calter seems content digging up people and incidents from 
his past that hell probably use in his writing and seeming to find 
that in his case he can go home again

nevada democrats open a threeday state 
convention today amid intense jockeying for slots on the 23member 
delegation to the democratic national convention in atlanta this 
summer 
party veterans say by the time the event winds down on sunday 
democratic presidential frontrunner michael dukakis could hold 
official and unofficial commitments from twothirds of the nevada 
delegation 
dukakis had 32 percent of the 980 delegates elected at earlier 
county conventions to attend the state convention while sen 
albert gore jr who hs since halted his campaign had 27 percent 
jesse jackson had 25 percent and the remaining 16 percent was 
uncommitted 
but the delegates are free to change their preferences as they 
sign in on friday and saturday and dukakis could be the big 
beneficiary now that gore popular in nevada is out of the picture 
however there is an effort to hold together the gore delegates 
so that theyll have representatives on the national delegation to 
do that they must maintain 15 percent of the total state 
convention delegation 
but if many of the gore delegates switch party officials 
predict dukakis will benefit more than jackson and could wind up 
with eight or nine of the 16 elected delegates 
nevada also has seven super delegates who have a voice at 
the convention due to being elected or party officeholders 
among those it was possible that dukakis would expand his 
current count of three to as many as six however some of those 
delegates will remain officially uncommitted despite their support 
for dukakis

strike leaders who escaped a predawn 
police raid to crush a 10day stoppage at the huge nowa huta 
steelworks expressed outrage that the assault came just hours after 
management agreed to reopen talks 
they claimed the strike was not ended by thursdays raid as 
authorities claimed and said police hurt at least 32 people in the 
action 
a priest who was present said many strikers were brutally beaten 
in a statement issued afterwards strike committee members who 
had gone into hiding called on plant workers to stay home the 
brutal actions by the zomos riot troops and the sb secret 
police did not break our strike 
before the riot squads moved in plainclothesmen had rousted the 
strikers from sleep with deafening percussion grenades 
strikers said a protest march against the raid occurred on plant 
grounds thursday morning and that as soon as police left many 
laborers refused to work 
the statement from strike leaders said that although their 
demands for higher wages free trade unions and the reinstatement 
of fired union activists had not changed their main concern now 
was for strikers arrested in the raid 
we have a moral duty to fight for their immediate release 
it said 
strike committee sources said committee chairman andrzej 
szewczuwaniec had worked out an evacuation plan in the event of a 
raid 
they said he and five other members of the 16member committee 
escaped the government said 38 people in all were seized during 
the twohour police action 
the whole thing took place without one bruise government 
spokesman jerzy urban told the associated press nobody suffered 
any harm or injury 
but several people present said police beat strikers after 
blocking exits from a building where the strike committee was based 
the rev tadeusz zaleski was with the strikers during the raid 
police later turned him over to roman catholic church officials 
zaleski said riot police were beating with very long heavy 
sticks 
some strikers were chased and beaten the riot police were 
very brutal and on many occasions beat people who already had been 
caught the priest added 
zaleski said police totally demolished the strike center 
emptying closets breaking windows and tossing around belongings 
he said his vestments were scattered and the altar where he said 
mass for workers was destroyed 
zygmunt lenyk of the conservative opposition group confederation 
of independent poland said 32 people suffered cuts eight people 
were left unconscious and one mans legs were broken 
strike sources said they were especially angry because the 
attack came after management apparently scheming to catch strikers 
off guard had just agreed to meet with the strike committee for 
the first time in a week 
anna mach whose husband maciej is on the strike committee said 
he called her at 1 am thursday and expressed relief that 
management agreed to meet with the committee and catholic mediators 
at 8 am 
one strike source said that at 7 am about 1500 workers began 
marching on the management building to protest the raid but were 
dispersed by police 
workers leaving the plant during an afternoon shift change 
thursday told western reporters that some people inside the mill 
had resumed striking 
the staterun news agency pap said plant operations were being 
restored but were hampered by up to 40 percent absenteeism which 
it blamed in part on threats by strikers against people who wanted 
to work 
the strike at the 32000worker steel mill began april 26 and 
talks broke off when it was declared illegal two days later strike 
leaders had claimed half the workforce was participating

the days of obliging cabbies chasing a missed 
train to the next town to get a passenger aboard may be gone but a 
missed riverboat posed only a bit of a problem for a little rock 
cabdriver tuesday 
the cabdriver fred higgins was hailed by bruce robinson of new 
haven conn outside the excelsior hotel 
robinson had missed a tour bus that was to take a conference 
group to riverfront park in north little rock where the spirit an 
excursion boat embarks on a dinner cruise on the arkansas river 
when higgins and robinson reached the park the boat had already 
left he was real disappointed so i said lets try one more 
time higgins said 
the cabbie headed upriver hoping to intercept the boat 
arriving at murray lock and dam they saw the spirit heading toward 
them in the distance the question then became how to get robinson 
from the taxi to the boat 
he really wanted to ride it bad said higgins who has 
worked for the cab company only a month spotting two men in a 
small pleasure boat he called them to shore and explained the 
situation the boaters took robinson aboard

beatrice c draper gave norwalks mayor a 
penny and her thoughts after she was billed for one cent on a 
delinquent city automobile tax 
draper said she tried to pay the debt in person after she 
received the first bill for one cent but a tax clerk wouldnt take 
the payment and said the debt wouldnt affect anything anyway 
then draper got hung up at a state department of motor vehicles 
office trying to register a car because computerized records showed 
she had a tax debt and the other day she received a second bill 
from the city for one cent 
she taped the penny to a letter she mailed to mayor frank j 
esposito 
the point i am trying to make is that the abuse of community 
and town funds is ridiculous she wrote the amount of money 
spent on time and postage could have been used to better advantage 
even though it costs 25 cents please send me a receipt of my 
onecent payment 
esposito blamed the charge on a new computer that sends the tax 
bills this is the first problem we know of and i am going to 
see what we can do to prevent this kind of thing from happening 
again the mayor said

aloha airlines president and chief executive 
officer maurice myers says aloha will match its maintenance 
inspection record against any carrier in the country 
according to federal aviation administration documents an 
indepth inspection of aloha by the faa last december found the 
airline did not have an adequate system to assure that its aircraft 
were properly maintained 
the inspection included examination of alohas compliance with a 
special surveillance requirement for aging aircraft but indicated 
no specific concerns about the aging boeing 737 jet which broke 
apart during a flight last week 
a 20foot section of the planes upper fuselage tore away at 
24000 feet sending a flight attendant to her death and injuring 
61 passengers although the plane limped to a safe landing 
according to the faa the 19yearold plane which had 89000 
landings was one of four aloha aircraft under a special inspection 
program aimed at aging aircraft as well as a special faa 
airworthiness directive warning about possible cracking in the 
upper portion of the fuselage 
the inspectors concluded that the airline did not have an 
effective internal audit program to make certain it was complying 
with federal requirements including emergency faa airworthiness 
directives 
myers said thursday the company had undergone the required 
investigation which he described as a very thorough inspection 
which focuses on procedures and record keeping not on equipment 
in our final briefing by the faa we were told by the 
inspection team that the items found were typical of airlines 
across the country and that we run a safe airline myers said in 
a statement we will match our maintenance inspection record 
against any carrier in the country 
aloha operates scheduled air service to four islands kauai 
oahu maui and hawaii in the hawaiian island group as well as 
some charter services

fbi director william sessions responded to 
questions about attorney general edwin meese iii by saying public 
officials have an obligation to maintain the highest legal and 
ethical standards 
an independent counsel investigating meese since last may 11 is 
expected to issue a report raising sharp questions about the 
attorney generals ethical behavior according to sources familiar 
with the probe 
ethical conduct in connection with lawyers particularly is a 
very sensitive matter sessions said thursday when asked by 
reporters about the embattled attorney general 
i think its even more important when youre dealing with a 
person who is in fact the attorney general of the united states 
and i think that mr meese would strongly agree with that added 
the fbi director 
sessions emphasized that he was addressing the principle of 
ethical conduct and not the specifics of the meese case the 
subject of a nearly yearlong investigation by a special prosecutor 
sessions said he would resign his own post if the public felt he 
had engaged in improprieties 
if it is perceived that the director of the fbi is not 
properly legally and ethically carrying out his responsibility i 
always have open the route of resignation for myself sessions 
said when asked in the context of meeses legal troubles what he 
would do if he sensed the public thought he were acting improperly 
but sessions added that i think theres a great deal of 
difference between a hypothetical situation involving himself and 
the circumstances involving allegations against meese 
when a reporter asked whether sessions would be unhappy if his 
remarks were interpreted as suggesting that meese his boss 
perhaps ought to resign the fbi director responded 
no i think youll have to draw your own conclusions but he 
quickly added that im trying to talk about general principles 
that i do believe apply to conduct of public officials i can 
speak as to myself but i am not trying to speak as to those 
circumstances that might involve mr meese 
after checking with meese about sessions remarks justice 
department spokesman terry eastland declined to comment 
independent counsel james c mckay has been investigating 
meeses ties to the scandalplagued wedtech corp a 1 billion 
iraqi pipeline and other matters sources familiar with the probe 
say mckay is expected to issue a report raising several ethical 
questions about the attorney generals ties to longtime friend e 
robert wallach who is under indictment in the wedtech case 
a senate subcommittee on thursday disclosed that two weeks 
before the head of the small business administration was fired in 
1982 meese was told by wallach that the sba chief was the central 
figure in deciding whether wedtech got a lucrative nobid contract 
apparently the key figure at this particular moment is frank 
cardenas the director of the sba wallach wrote thenwhite house 
counselor meese in a jan 21 1982 memo released by the senate 
subcommittee if my information is correct this may be the last 
step and cardenas is the key figure 
the sba administrator at that time was michael cardenas 
a few days earlier cardenas and his deputy david gonzales had 
decided not to sign off on the wedtech contract until the army was 
satisfied with the terms and conditions according to a report by 
the senate subcommittee 
but cardenas was dismissed by the white house on feb 5 1982 on 
grounds of incompetence and gonzales was forced out with him 
the senate subcommittee reached no conclusions about whether 
cardenas was fired because of the wedtech contract or whether 
wallachs memo to meese alerted the white house counselor to the 
situation 
copies of 16 memos by wallach then a wedtech consultant to 
meese including the one dated jan 21 1982 were released by the 
senate subcommittee on oversight of government management 
on wednesday the panel released a report concluding that meese 
and his deputy james jenkins had violated a white house policy 
barring participation in individual contracts resulting in 
improper favoritism toward wedtech

the united states must make a much more 
ambitious effort to cut its budget deficit for the benefit of 
other countries as well as itself the international monetary fund 
says 
recent history suggests that such an approach need not create 
serious dangers of an economic downturn according to the funds 
new world economic outlook distributed this week 
the fund a consortium of 151 governments including the united 
states says continued high us deficits could trigger world 
market reactions that would sharply reduce us growth cut 
spending output and investment in other industrial countries and 
make further shifts in the value of the dollar and other currencies 
all this could occur with or without a stock market decline it 
adds 
the fund calculates that last falls crash is costing the united 
states half of one percentage point of growth equal to about 20 
billion this year and the same amount in 1989 
it said third world countries could suffer because a slowdown of 
growth in the industrial world would reduce the demand for the raw 
materials they produce at the same time the poorer countries 
would cut their imports but their exports would also fall reducing 
the income available to keep up with payments on their debts 
the fund says the us deficit was cut by 2 percent in the year 
that ended last sept 30 without any significant harm to business 
this year it points out there will be increased help to us 
business from higher exports

jesse jackson campaigning in the state with 
the nations biggest delegate prize declared he is hot on the 
heels of democratic frontrunner michael dukakis 
jackson arrived thursday afternooon in california and took a 
stroll through historic olvera street site of the old los angeles 
mission church and a center of hispanic culture 
later he hobnobbed with celebrities at a hollywood fund raiser 
where about 200 people paid 100 each to hear him speak 
among those attending were lloyd bridges eileen brennan tony 
franciosa and dennis weaver who said he supports jackson because 
he will bring a love ethic to washington 
jackson gave a preview on olvera street of the issues he will be 
emphasizing as he campaigns for californias june 7 primary 
election 
he spoke against the movement to make english the offiical 
language of the united states and discussed immigration the 
strife in central america usmexico relations and his proposal 
to raise the minimum wage 
in a chaotic crowd that gathered by jacksons bus on olvera 
street a couple of hecklers revived controversy that dogged 
jackson in new york where jacksons sometimes shaky relations with 
the jewish community were spotlighted 
the hecklers shouted lose jesse lose and welcome to 
hymietown a reference to the offensive term jackson used for new 
york in his 1984 presidential campaign 
but a man nearby shouted win it for the minorities anyway 
jesse 
polls have shown jackson trailing dukakis badly in california 
but campaign officials said they are looking at the state as a 
wideopen contest where jackson can make inroads among minority 
groups gays and other interest groups 
despite dukakis increasing delegate lead over him jackson told 
an impromptu gathering at el paseo mexican restaurant on olvera 
street we are hot on his heels and were getting stronger as the 
days get longer 
former state health chief mario obledo who heads latinos for 
jackson said california is our best state ever i feel fairly 
confident were going to win this state 
jackson is expected to have an uphill fight for the hispanic 
vote with many hispanics impressed by dukakis fluent spanish 
across from where jackson spoke a shop on olvera street boasted 
a dukakis poster in the window 
to cast a positive light on his progress after a string of 
losses to dukakis jackson is stressing the popular vote so far 
rather than the delegate race 
dukakis has 37 percent we have 29 percent he told the 
hollywood fund raiser 
were within striking distance we will win this campaign 
because hope has been reborn he said 
dukakis delegate lead is much larger than the popular vote gap 
with jackson trailing him by more than 500 delegates out of the 
2081 needed to win the nomination 
in the past two days jackson began to make an issue of the 
disparity although party rules allow for states to set up 
delegateselection systems that are not directly proportionate to 
the popular vote 
jackson on thursday urged that socalled super delegates and at 
large delegates those not chosen by voters directly show 
fairness by committing to candidates who won the popular vote 
in their congressional districts 
party officials should step in and make sure there is a 
reasonable correlation betwen popular vote and delegates he said 
he urged that super delegates not get on the dukakis bandwagon 
before the primaries are over 
jackson warned that his supporters may not vote for a democrat 
in november if they feel their vote does not count 
the most positive consequence of being fair is that people are 
inspired when people are inspired and diligent they work 
diligently he said if they dont think they are treated fairly 
however he said they get discouraged 
jackson said he was not seeking rule changes as he did in 1984 
but that he was instead talking of a matter of rule 
interpretation

former secretary of state henry kissinger 
called it disgraceful that the french government reportedly 
made concessions to iran to win the release of three hostages in 
lebanon 
kissinger said thursday that frances action raises the risk 
for all other nationalities because now the iranians will 
undoubtedly believe that they can make similar deals with other 
nations and it will be a gory extended effort to prove that they 
cant 
french goverment officials denied they paid ransom for the 
hostages release but others accused the country of dealing with 
terrorists while 18 other foreigners remain hostage reports said 
that in exchange for the three frenchmen france agreed to pay the 
outstanding balance on a loan originally totaling 1 billion made 
by the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
i think the french action today is disgraceful kissinger 
said 
he added that while it would it wouldnt feasible to engage in 
economic reprisals against france i would think that it should 
effect those relationships over which we have some discretion 
it certainly disappoints me severely that a french prime 
minister a conservative prime minister would engage in such 
actions kissinger said referring to premier jacques chirac 
kissinger appeared on abctvs nightline program along with 
former national security adviser robert mcfarlane who was involved 
in the secret irancontra negotiations to win the release of 
americans held in lebanon and peggy say sister to american 
hostage terry anderson anderson chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press is the longestheld hostage in lebanon 
mcfarlane said there are no moderate officials to deal with in 
iran and that to literally deal with the devil for whatever 
shortterm gain it might get us would only encourage the taking 
of more hostages 
mrs say said that while it is easy to discuss theories of 
foreign policy my job has to be the voice for terry anderson and 
the other hostages whose voices cant be heard 
these are american lives and it seems to me that there has to 
be a better way she said i think there are better answers 
than doing nothing and just literally turning our backs on these 
men and saying were sorry if they have to die but we have to 
stop terrorism

michael dukakis today began a short vacation from 
the campaign trail after urging voters in nebraska and west 
virginia to support him in tuesdays primaries and his expected 
fall campaign against george bush 
we are not conceding one state to the republicans this fall 
dukakis said at his last campaign stop thursday in omaha neb 
repeating a pledge he made earlier in west virginia and again in 
indiana during a refueling stop 
we have a very very good chance of winning this election 
the likely democratic nominee said in indiana which gave him a big 
primary victory last week we will contest in every one of the 50 
states 
the massachusetts governor returned to boston late thursday he 
was to work at the statehouse today before taking the first weekend 
off from campaigning since christmas 
dukakis known for his caution had until thursday been careful 
to mention his continuing competition from democrat jesse jackson 
but dukakis began and ended his day thursday with assaults on the 
vice president and mentioned jackson only as an afterthought 
he repeatedly attacked bushs assertion he would be the 
education president and also said bush had sat by as the reagan 
administration allowed corporate raiders to engage in merger 
mania that cost 500000 jobs 
after emerging from a tour of a coal mine in ecomomically 
depressed west virginia dukakis and united mine workers president 
rich trumka said reagan and bush had turned their back on 
struggling regions of the country 
i believe very deeply that the president of the united states 
has a responsibility to all people in all parts of the country 
dukakis told a group of miners we need a president who 
understands what economic leadership is west virginia has the 
secondhighest unemployment rate in the country 
inside the mine dukakis operated a huge machine and said he 
would suggest building coalfired power plants near the mines with 
the electricity to be sold to energydependent areas of the country 
you dont need an evacuation plan when you build a coalfired 
plant said dukakis who has blocked the opening of a nuclear 
power plant in new hampshire by refusing to submit a required 
evacuation plan for massachusetts communities within 10 miles of 
the plant 
dukakis also said he hopes to receive good giveandtake 
from his cabinet another dig at bush who said wednesday he 
sometimes keeps quiet at white house meetings because i dont 
want the president to have to be choosing between his vice 
president and the other members of the cabinet 
dukakis scoffed at that stance 
i have a lively cabinet and sometimes they get loud and 
contentious he said thats the way you get good 
giveandtake i hope ill have a vice president who speaks up 
and speak out 
earlier dukakis challenged bushs claim that he would be an 
education president and said the white house must always be an 
advocate for education not just during election years 
although dukakis has said he welcomes competition from jackson 
he dropped his standard reference to jackson from a line he 
frequently uses to close his speeches 
in recent weeks dukakis has marveled that the two remaining 
democrats are the son of greek immigrants and a black man who 
grew up poor in south carolina 
but on thursday he concluded his speech in charleston by saying 
the best america is a nation where with your help the son of 
greek immigrants can seek and win the presidency 
he delivered the same line again in omaha and added i believe 
i will 
also thursday the dukakis campaign released federal tax returns 
that showed the governor and his wife kitty had joint income of 
108957 last year and paid 25892 in federal taxes

the director of an environmental group dedicated 
to protecting californias mono lake says research suggesting 
radioactive waste might have been dumped there raises questions 
about how nuclear waste is being handled 
its obviously of grave concern and a major public policy 
question says martha davis director of the mono lake committee 
in los angeles id be very interested in what the response of 
government officials is going to be to this 
on thursday researchers said measurements of historical levels 
of radioactive carbon in the remote california lake suggest that 
nuclear waste may have been secretly dumped there in the 1950s and 
perhaps again in the 1970s 
we think radiocarbon had to be added to that lake in large 
quantities said wallace broecker of columbia universitys 
lamontdoherty geological observatory in palisades ny 
his study is in the current issue of earth and planetary science 
letters 
davis calls the finding a question of public policy how 
well were handling our waste 
the researchers used various techniques to rule out other 
possible sources of radioactive carbon such as atmospheric testing 
of atomic bombs increases found in other nearby lakes and in the 
ocean can be attributed to the bomb testing but mono lakes 
increase is far too great for that broecker said in a telephone 
interview 
mono lake is one of the nations most important bird 
sanctuaries a scenic wonder that attracts millions of birds and 
hundreds of thousands of human visitors each year davis said she 
said the birds either make their homes there or use the lake as a 
way station during migrations it is dotted with strange columns of 
tufa a limestone rock built up from calcium deposited by the lake 
the principal threat to the lake is the diversion of water 
upstream to supply los angeles the radioactive dumping that 
broecker and his colleagues think is likely to have taken place 
poses no threat to humans or wildlife at the lake broecker said 
the radiation levels are too low 
residents of los angeles drink water from streams supplying the 
lake not from the lake itself which is extremely salty 
the lakes levels of the radioactive form of carbon known as 
carbon14 have increased by 60 percent since the mid1950s 
broecker said about four times more than would have been expected 
from fallout from atomic bomb tests 
the radioactive waste that broecker thinks was dumped there 
could have come from radioactive samples used in medicine from 
nuclear reactors or from nuclear weapons research broecker said 
in the 1950s people had lots of these things and what were 
they doing with them we know what they were doing with chemical 
wastes they were stashing them any place they could broecker 
said 
broecker is a geochemist his study was intended to examine the 
exchange rate of gases such as carbon dioxide back and forth 
between the lake and the atmosphere 
karl turekian chairman of the department of geology at yale 
university and editor of the journal in which the study appears 
said broeckers suggestion that radioactive waste was dumped in the 
lake is a very reasonable speculation 
broeckers study involved measurement of ordinary carbon and of 
carbon14 among many other observations similar measurements were 
made at pyramid lake and walker lake in nevada which are in some 
respects similar to mono lake 
mono lake puzzled us because it gave a really aberrant 
result broecker said 
broecker and his colleagues including scott stine a 
postdoctoral fellow at lamontdoherty found that they could 
reconstruct historical levels of carbon14 in the lake by measuring 
the carbon14 deposited along its shoreline 
each year the lake has shrunk in size and leaves deposits of 
calcium carbonate on a new shoreline those shorelines record the 
shrinking of the lake the way tree rings record a trees growth 
samples can be taken from various dated shorelines and used to 
provide a record of the carbon content of the lake at that time 
broecker said 
the carbon14 levels jumped between 1952 and 1958 and again by 
a smaller amount between 1966 and 1977 broecker said the later 
increase could represent a second dumping of radioactive waste or 
it could be the result of corrosion of canisters of waste dumped in 
the 1950s he said

agriculture 
in an interview before a rally at the national guard armory

cabinetlevel agriculture post would have plenty of handson 
experience 
im talking about somebody who knows what it means to farm and 
earn a living said the massachusetts governor in a brief 
campaign appearance thursday 
he said he would choose someone who understands the importance 
of family farming who could work with me and the congress to help 
shape an agricultural policy that emphasizes the importance of 
family farmers 
dukakis said his farm policy would differ from the reagan 
administrations which he said seems to suggest they favor a 
totally free economy 
i dont know anybody who knows anything about farming who 
thinks you can do that we are going to need a combination of 
supply management and reasonable price supports in the foreseeable

city officials say democratic presidential 
candidate jesse jackson can be the grand marshal of an annual 
mexicanamerican parade without threatening public funding of the 
event as long as organizers agree in writing by noon today that it 
is not a partisan political rally 
the mission economic and cultural association organizers of 
saturdays cinco de mayo parade which celebrates the mexican 
armys defeat of invading french forces in mexico in 1862 agreed

politics out of the event 
we agree with it in principle said roberto hernandez 
director of the mission association the fine tuning well have

not sanction signs or banners and that no partisan speeches will be 
made if so about 11000 in city funds from a local hotel tax

federal agents will join the investigation of 
the 450 million fire that killed one man injured 40 other people 
and incinerated four floors of californias tallest skyscraper 
the inferno at the 62story first interstate bank tower spread 
so quickly that fire officials are citing a flashover effect a 
phenomenon in which materials become superheated causing a 
firestorm 
the movie towering inferno doesnt do this justice 
firefighter richard androtti said during the fire fight early 
thursday referring to the 1974 movie about a los angeles highrise 
fire 
fire officials called in the us treasury departments bureau 
of alcohol tobacco and firearms because of the severity and scale 
of the blaze the worst highrise fire in the citys history said 
assistant fire chief peter lucarelli 
the request doesnt necessarily mean arson is suspected but 
rather that there is a need for the atfs technical expertise said 
fire department spokesman greg acevedo 
the 859foottall skyscraper lacked a sprinkler system because 
it was built in 1973 a year before the city fire code required 
sprinklers however the bank had decided to install sprinklers 
voluntarily and work on the 35 million system was more than 90 
percent complete bank officials said 
investigators refused thursday night to speculate publicly on 
the cause of the blaze and hadnt pinpointed where in the building 
it began acevedo said 
the new york times reported in todays editions that the fire 
began on the 12th floor which houses the banks government bond 
trading division a division the bank said wednesday it was 
selling it also said it would be laying off 100 workers 
the blaze which began late wednesday night and roared for 
nearly four hours chased night workers to the roof of the 
highrise where 10 were rescued by helicopters as a ring of flames 
roiled around the 12th through 15th floors others fled down stairs 
in thick smoke 
the badly burned body of janitor alexander handy 24 of 
palmdale was found in an elevator stuck on the 12th floor said 
county coroners spokesman steve stewart the cause of death hadnt 
been determined 
a mechanism that was supposed to return all elevators to the 
ground floor in case of fire apparently failed officials said 
a cleaning supervisor zora imamovic 38 of glendale said she 
and five others made their way from the 58th floor to the roof and 
were flown to safety over her twoway radio she said she heard a 
man calling for help 
one of the men was saying car 33 a freight elevator was in 
flames and he was screaming please help she said 
firefighters wearing air tanks had to lug hoses down stairs from 
the roof and up from the ground to attack the flames 
they had 2000degree temperatures they were fighting said 
fire chief donald manning one of the 300 firefighters who battled 
the flames the individuals in there were committed so far in on 
the fire that they would run out of air they could not back out 
they had to stay there and fight that fire or they knew as they 
told me they were gonna die 
this had a potential of killing a lot of my people 
thirtyseven maintenance workers and three firefighters were 
treated for burns or smoke inhalation officials said 
on thursday councilman nate holden said he would propose an 
ordinance requiring fire sprinklers in all city highrises more 
than 500 buildings classified as highrises in the nations 
secondlargest city lack sprinklers 
fire officials said a sprinkler system almost certainly would 
have prevented the disaster 
a potentially greater tragedy was averted because the blaze 
occurred at night during a workday the building is occupied by 
3500 people 
first interstate bancorp the banks parent company continued 
securities sales and trading thursday on the stock market with 
assets of 585 billion first interstate is the nations 
eighthlargest banking company with 44 banks and offices in 19 
states

employees failed to report early signs of 
trouble before two november prison uprisings by cuban inmates says 
an official report that also blames the state department for giving 
too little notice of a deportation agreement that sparked the 
rioting 
the justice department report by a committee from the bureau of 
prisons and other agencies says the federal prisons had no plans 
for dealing with total takeovers and it recommends several changes 
in prison design and management 
the report to the house judiciary committee said that wardens at 
the prisons in atlanta ga and oakdale la failed to secure the 
facilities partly because early signs of trouble were not relayed 
to them by prison personnel 
of particular significance at both oakdale and atlanta was 
inadequate communication among staff the misinterpretation of 
intelligence indicating potential unrest and the fact that 
important information never reached officials at appropriate levels 
of authority the report said 
the rioting was touched off by state department announcement of 
an agreement with cuba that could have led to deportation of the 
inmates who were prisoners and mental patients among 125000 
cubans sent to florida in the 1980 mariel boatlift 
the report blamed the state department for giving prison 
officials only four hours notice of their public announcement of 
the agreement 
the rioting which lasted eight days at oakdale and 11 days at 
atlanta included the taking of 138 prison employee hostages and 
resulted in the death of a detainee the government estimated the 
1394 inmates at atlanta and 987 at oakdale destroyed 644 million 
in prison property and that it cost 489 million to quell the 
disturbances and relocate the cubans 
the report said the inmates showed a remarkably high degree of 
organization after taking control of the institutions 
designating particular inmates as cooks guards unit managers and 
lieutenants and holding drills 
the report said emergency plans at both institutions failed to 
consider the possibility of institutionwide disturbances saying 
takeovers as complete as those at oakdale and atlanta literally 
were unimagined 
the report listed 107 recommendations covering such areas as 
emergency management hostage negotiations equipment inventories 
training media relations and prison construction 
it recommended training to help better predict and avoid prison 
trouble also it said prisons should be designed so that food 
storage areas records and utility controls are located outside 
areas secured for the holding of inmates

richard s caliguiri mayor of pittsburgh 
since 1977 died early today at a hospital according to the 
allegheny county coroners office he was 56 years old 
the mayor died at 136 am of cardiac amyloidosis a rare 
incurable disease which deposited dangerous amounts of protein in 
his heart and other major organs according to the coroners office 
caliguiri was taken to shadyside hospital around 1245 am a 
paramedic pounded on the mayors chest and tubes had been inserted 
into his mouth according to the pittsburgh postgazette 
paramedics were called to the mayors home at 1210 am the 
newspaper said he was carried from his home about a halfhour 
later on a stretcher 
the mayors wife jeanne and one of his sons followed the city 
ambulance carrying caliguiri to the hospital the newspaper said 
caliguiri stunned pittsburgh in october when he disclosed that 
he suffered from the noncontagious disease whose cause is unknown 
caliguiri became aware that something was wrong with him in 
march 1987 when he became dizzy while playing golf after tests 
doctors determined caliguiri suffered from the disease but nothing 
was said publicly until later that year 
last summer friends and political acquantainces began to notice 
that caliguiri who was short in stature looked pale and even 
thinner than his normal weight of 140 pounds 
for a while he dismissed concern by saying it was only an 
intestinal ailment but finally on oct 2 he revealed the true 
nature of his illness 
on dec 24 1987 surgeons at shadyside hospital inserted a 
pacemaker in caliguiris chest to regulate his heartbeat 
earlier this week dr james otoole caliguiris cardiologist 
said he was evalutaing the possibility ofa heart transplant for the 
mayor 
caliguiri a democrat first became mayor of pittsburgh in 1977 
in addition to his wife caliguiri is survived by two sons

fighting heat smoke and flames at dizzying heights like los 
angeles 62story first international bank building can turn 
firefighters into highrise commandos facing special dangers and 
physical punishment 
its like fighting a bungalow fire 200 feet in the air said 
jerry lawrence of the chicago fire department which protects the 
1454foot tall sears tower the tallest building in the country 
and among the most fireproof 
skyscraper fires are physically exhausting to put out with 
firefighters huffing up stairs with 50 pounds of equipment and air 
tanks on their backs reserves are called up often for relief and 
to replenish air supplies 
its a very hazardous punishing type of fire said roger 
lanaham of the us fire administration in the federal emergency 
management agency you have to have shock troops its like a 
tough football game you have to keep bringing in fresh blood 
people trapped above the fire must be evacuated sometimes by 
helicopter but preferably down stairwells and precautions must be 
taken to keep those on the street from being showered with 
heatshattered glass 
aerial ladders and cranes reach no higher than 10 floors so 
firefighters work the fire from the inside setting up a staging 
area on a floor below the fire they bring hoses equipment first 
aid and compressed air oxygen is never carried because it can 
ignite 
its a manual operation that takes more personnel than any 
other fire its also an inside fire they cant put the fire out 
from the outside thats what makes it so dangerous said joseph 
redden spokesman for the national fire protection association in 
quincy mass a former newark nj fire chief 
highrise fires create a chimney effect sucking heat and smoke 
up stairwells and elevator shafts to the top of the building 
firefighters open bulkheads or smash holes in the roof to prevent 
explosive buildups 
in the 1980 mgm grand hotel fire in las vegas nev 74 of the 
87 deaths came from smoke inhalation according to fire officials 
most victims were found trapped on the top seven floors of the 
26story building 
another fire that prompted improved designs and sprinkler 
systems was a 1986 blaze that killed 97 people including 84 on a 
first floor casino at the dupont plaza hotel in san juan puerto 
rico three hotel workers pleaded guilty to setting the fire 
in a fire smoke is usually a killer not the flames said 
john mulligan spokesman for the new york city fire department a 
highrise fire is going to be hot and smoky and among the most 
difficult firefighting conditions 
new york has 1200 highrises or buildings that are more than 75 
feet tall the city averages one fire per day in a highrise 
although most are in lower floors and are easily contained 
mulligan said 
firefighters say real life bears little resemblance to the 
hollywood hokum of the movie the towering inferno in which 
most of the stars scrambled to the roof to await rescue 
you never want to get above the fire redden said thats 
the worst place you can be

human saliva contains a factor that blocks the 
aids virus from infecting cells indicating the body may have a 
natural defense against the deadly disease preliminary studies 
indicate 
fears about kissing contact with eating implements and so on 
could be dispelled by this kind of evidence said enid neidle an 
assistant director of the chicagobased american dental 
association which reported the study in the may issue of its 
journal 
isolating and understanding the inhibitory element in saliva may 
help researchers learn how to naturally prevent the transmission of 
the virus said philip fox head of clinical studies at the 
national institute of dental research and senior investigator in 
the study 
the significance is that its a demonstration of a natural 
defense that people have against the aids virus fox said 
thursday in a telephone interview from the national institutes of 
health in bethesda md 
the research also provides a biological explanation of why the 
mouth isnt a transmission route for the disease fox said thats 
good news for dentists and others concerned about catching aids 
through contact with the saliva of infected people 
this supports biologically what we have been seeing 
epidemiologically said irwin mandel director of the center for 
clinical research in dentistry at columbia university in new york 
there is essentially no chance of transmission of the virus 
through saliva 
fox and four coworkers collected saliva samples from the mouths 
of three healthy men and secretions directly from the major 
salivary glands 
none of the three was at risk for acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome which destroys the bodys defenses against disease and 
leaves a person prey to lifethreatening infections and certain 
cancers 
the samples were mixed with human immunodeficiency virus1 
hiv the virus that causes aids and lymphocytes immune system 
cells that are the major targets for the virus 
the virus wasnt able to infect the lymphocytes in the saliva or 
the secretions from the submandibular and sublingual glands at the 
bottom of the mouth the researchers found 
however in two of the men secretions from the parotid salivary 
gland near the ear were infected secretions from the parotid gland 
of the third man were not infected 
the researchers arent certain how the inhibitory element works 
but fox said it may interfere with the receptors through which 
white blood cells are infected by the aids virus 
the researchers currently are expanding their work to include 
women children and people infected with aids fox said 
the latest study expands on research done two years ago in which 
scientists found that the aids virus was neutralized by saliva from 
humans and chimpanzees fox said 
at the time researchers didnt know whether the neutralizing 
agent was a product of the salivary glands or one of the other 
elements of saliva such as blood components bacteria or cells 
the new study shows that the hivneutralizing element is a 
product of the submandibular and sublingual glands mandel said 
theoretically the study results could lead to the discovery of 
a natural immunization against aids mandel said 
researchers now must isolate the hivneutralizing element in 
saliva find out how it works and then learn how to activate it in 
the body as a defense against aids said mandel a pioneer in the 
study of saliva as a protective factor against disease 
the aids virus is believed to be passed mainly through sexual 
intercourse shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to 
their infants before or during birth 
more than 60000 cases of aids and 34088 aids deaths have been 
reported in the united states from june 1981 through may 2 
according to the national centers for disease control in atlanta

brown university has added two more 
courses to the number required for graduation partially reversing 
a 19yearold move to make its curriculum more flexible 
students in the ivy league schools class of 1993 will be 
required to pass 30 courses to qualify for a bachelors degree 
robert reichley vice president for university relations said 
thursday 
the current system was adopted as part of a wideranging 
curriculum reform in 1969 the new curriculum cut the 
graduation requirement from 32 to 28 courses and abolished 
distribution requirements and the grade of f 
a student who fails a course at brown does not receive credit 
for the course but the failure is not recorded on his or her 
transcript 
the reforms were intended to allow students to experiment by 
taking courses in areas outside their major fields of study without 
worrying about failure students still paid for 32 courses but 
could fail four without penalty 
many students were not using the system as intended according 
to a study conducted by dean sheila blumstein 
of the class of 1987 44 percent took 30 or fewer courses and 
twothirds of the students graduating with fewer than 32 courses 
did not even register for 32 blumstein found 
blumstein and reichley said the change was essentially a 
finetuning of the system and does not represent a major retreat 
reichley said the change has nothing to do with us education 
secretary william bennetts wellpublicized call for a return to 
basics in us higher education 
brown still does not require students to take specific classes 
outside their majors or fulfill distribution requirements by 
taking classes in several specified fields reichley said many top 
schools do have those requirements 
brown officials have cited the 1969 reforms as one reason the 
university has become among the nations most popular and most 
competitive 
blumstein said she thinks the tougher graduation requirement 
will have little effect on browns popularity and said students 
seem to support it 
the change brings brown more into line with requirements at 
other top universities 
harvard requires the equivalent of 32 semesterlong classes for 
graduation while yale requires 36 at princeton liberal arts 
students are required to take 30 courses and complete a senior 
thesis an option at brown while engineers are required to take 
36

by a slim majority united methodist delegates 
have called for a boycott of royal dutchshell petroleum products 
until it pulls out of south africa or apartheid is ended 
only with the support of international oil corporations can 
the apartheid regime survive said the churchs governing 
conference asking members to refrain from purchasing shell 
products 
the narrowly approved action by a vote of 475 to 418 came 
after sharp debate late thursday in which two texans strongly 
objected saying shell actively opposed apartheid and promoted 
blacks in jobs education and housing 
others argued for the move saying oil was the fuel of 
apartheid and that the company while verbally opposing 
apartheid did nothing effectively to end it 
apartheid is south africas system of law and custom which 
establishes a racially segregated society in which 5 million whites 
deny the nations 26 million blacks any vote in national affairs 
in a statement the us shell oil company expressed 
disappointment at the methodists action saying thousands of its 
employees who are methodists will find it difficult to 
understand 
calling the action a discriminatory secondary boycott since 
the us company itself a subsidiary has no investments or 
operations in south africa the company said 
the individuals who will be hardest hit by a boycott against 
shell are the innocent american service station owners and jobbers 
who sell shell products 
as the 11day conference of the 96million church neared a 
close friday night it refused to make more strict its rules for 
overseeing behavior of clergy 
it was proposed that the rules be changed to allow a minister to 
be put on trial if he refused to cooperate in answering questions 
but this was rejected after opponents said it could lead to 
witchhunt abuses 
no mention was made in the debate of the case of the rev julian 
rush a parttime denver pastor who admits his homosexuality but 
refuses to say if he is actively so 
that if it were the case would make him ineligible for the 
clergy under church disciplines 
the conference condemned interventions by more powerful 
nations against weaker ones declaring 
these actions undermine international law breed injustice 
frustrate the selfdetermination of peoples and are responsible for 
untold human suffering 
ihstead of military interventions the church urged regional and 
international negotiations and diplomatic efforts such as the 
contadora peace process in nicaragua to settle disputes 
of the south african situation the church pledged its own 
efforts to end apartheid calling it persistent disobedience to 
the word of god 
the denomination adopted a national quadrennial budget of 410 
million amounting to 1350 annually per member most of their 
contributions totalling 25 billion annually go to work of local 
congregations and regional units

the sister of captive american journalist 
terry anderson says the us government has decided to let these 
men die rather than to pursue the release of its hostages as the 
french did 
it almost appears that the french government places a higher 
priority on the lives of their people peggy say said thursday 
three french hostages including one who said he was a cellmate 
of anderson were released wednesday by their proiranian captors 
highranking officials of the french government apparently 
negotiated for their release 
the us government however refuses to negotiate with 
terrorists as a matter of principle and joined great britain in 
expressing hopes that the french did not make a deal for the 
hostages 
i find it rather embarrassing that they would call france to 
task for making a deal in view of the fact that this government 
sold arms to iran in a poorly conceived initiative that might have 
freed the hostages said mrs say who has spoken out several 
times on behalf of her brother and the eight other american 
hostages believed held in lebanon 
i hope they pursue whatever channels the french used but i 
doubt they will mrs say said im not a political wizard 
but it seems to me that their rationale that they wont negotiate 
because they want to bring an end to terrorism is irrational 
what they are saying is that they know of no other solution to 
this situation than to let these men die she said 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press has been held since march 16 1985 the longest of any 
hostage 
one of the freed french hostages marcel fontaine said he was 
andersons cellmate and that he recently played chess and dominoes 
with him 
its good to know terry is alive but im afraid this doesnt 
necessarily mean anything will be forthcoming mrs say said from 
her upstate new york home she said she would fly to paris this 
weekend to meet with fontaine 
earlier mrs say said that the release of the french hostages 
was encouraging because she might be able to learn from them about 
her brothers condition 
they must have talked and maybe he knows something about what 
terry is thinking she said im hoping he can give me some 
indication of what i should do next

fallen evangelist jimmy swaggart his 
television outlets dwindling says his troubled worldwide ministry 
is scraping the bottom 
as three major cable networks dropped swaggarts programs the 
embattled minister took to the airwaves this week not to preach 
fireandbrimestone gospel of his television ministry but to plead 
for 6 million 
we have to raise the funds if we are to keep the ministry 
going swaggart said during a televised appeal with his wife 
frances and son donnie stations will cancel if we cannot pay 
them we cannot pay them what we do not have 
swaggart left the assemblies of god the nations largest 
pentecostal denomination on april 8 after refusing to abide by a 
oneyear suspension from the pulpit and television for his 
confession of moral failure 
although swaggart did not specify his sin during a tearful 
confession to his congregation on feb 21 two church officials 
have said that swaggart told them a prostitute posed nude for him 
while he watched 
the evangelist has said he plans to return to the pulpit on may 
22 in accordance with a threemonth suspension ordered by state 
denomination officials that decision was later overturned by 
national church leaders 
in his fundraising plea swaggart said his church faces the 
most crucial time of any ministry in the history of the world 
we are scraping the bottom 
one of the cable networks that dropped swaggart was ptl which 
itself has been rocked by financial losses since former assemblies 
of god minister jim bakker stepped down last year after admitting 
to adultery 
ptl earlier had decided to remove swaggarts programs if he 
failed to abide by the oneyear suspension the cbn cable network 
canceled swaggarts programs earlier and black entertainment 
television another cable outlet dropped the evangelist last week 
the three networks reach about 70 million homes 
since his departure from the denomination contributions to the 
jimmy swaggart world ministries have dropped sharply at least 
seven ministers in key administrative positions have left and a 
state appeals court has said that fellow defrocked evangelist 
marvin gorman should have his day in court in a lawsuit he filed 
against swaggart 
the baton rouge morning advocate reported that after the scandal 
broke contributions fell quickly from 500000 per day to possibly 
below the 350000 the ministry needs to stay afloat ministry 
officials have refused to comment 
last month swaggarts wife and son staged a weeklong televised 
fundraiser in which they described the ministrys financial 
condition as critical ministry officials would not say how much 
money was raised 
swaggart said that regardless of what happens he will be back 
in the pulpit on may 22 if may 22 doesnt hurry up and get here 
i am going out behind the house and preach to the frogs he said 
with a chuckle 
gorman who reportedly photographed swaggart outside a seedy 
motel with a woman and later turned the pictures over to church 
officials claims in his 190 million suit that swaggart plotted to 
ruin his ministry through a smear campaign accusing him of a series 
of adulterous affairs with women he had counseled

the united states has offered its conditional

to rival the sovietbacked afghanistan regime according to a 
report published today 
a state department official met with afghan rebel leaders in

a new us navyescorted 
convoy sailed south in the persian gulf after iran reasserted the 
right to attack unarmed merchant ships as a tactic in its war with 
iraq 
the williams took over escort duty in the northern gulf from the 
frigate uss sides over two kuwaitiowned americanflagged 
80000ton oil tankers the chesapeake city and ocean city 
operating under president reagans new orders to extend 
protection to nonus flagged ships the 3700ton guided missile 
frigate rendezvoused at midday thursday with the sides which 
cruised alongside the loaded tankers from kuwait at the northern 
edge of the gulf 
led by a cobra attack helicopter scanning the seas for mines 
the williams escorted the tankers as they headed for the strait of 
hormuz at the southern end of the gulf on a twoday trip 
no tagalongs were spotted from the deck of the frigate but the 
threethip convoy may find some neutral merchant ships frequently 
seek safety in numbers in the gulf 
lt cmdr mark van dyke told a pentagon media pool on the 
williams that the new rules will allow the 28 warships washington 
has sent to the region to protect any neutral ship attacked as long 
as it was not carrying cargo for use by iran or iraq who have been 
at war for 7 years 
the master has to certify to us by radio that it is not 
carrying any belligerent cargo before we can help he said as 
one of several conditions 
iran said in a statement tuesday that it is justified in firing 
on unarmed merchant ships parliament speaker akbar hashemi 
rafsanjani was quoted in news reports as saying the raids were 
conducted only against irans accomplices in the war 
despite the heated rhetoric iran has yet to test the new us 
policy afer its april 18 sea battles with us forces that sank or 
damaged six iranian vessels 
officers aboard this ship which played a key role in last 
months fighting said they are worried most about running into an 
underwater mine planted by iran 
they dont even have to lay them just threaten to lay them 
said williams captain cmdr edward mann all day thursday 
crewmen took hourlong mine watch turns tethered to keep them from 
being hurtled overboard with m60 automatic weapons at the ready 
they peered through highpowered binoculars from the bow of the 
ship trying to spot mines ahead 
mann and other officers said they were not very concerned about 
an nbc news report from washington that quoted intelligence sources 
as saying iran was massing more than 100 speedboats near hormuz for 
a possible attack iran has used speedboats for attacks on ships in 
the past 
it could mean anything who knows what they are up to said 
one officer when asked about the report another officer dismissed 
it saying they are likely to do anything so your guess is as 
good as mine 
iran has threatened revenge for the april 18 battle 
adm william j crowe chairman of the us joint chiefs of 
staff told the pentagon pool earlier this week that irans threats 
are still taken very seriously 
no new mines have been found since the april 18 sea battle and 
no engagements or harassments have been reported by the navy 
an officer said a mine captured last september from the iran ajr 
warship cost only 500 to make because it was a simple model based 
on a 1908 russian mine 
five hundred bucks he said not a bad return on your 
investment five hundred dollars to blow a 500 million ship

lawyers for union carbide corp today asked 
district court judge mw deo to remove himself from hearing 
indias 3 billion suit against the company for negligence in the 
1984 bhopal gas disaster 
lawyers for the indian government and victims of the leak the 
worlds worst industrial accident criticized the move as a 
delaying tactic 
the request was made by carbide lawyer fali nariman who 
contended in a petition that deo showed bias by ordering on dec 17 
that the corporation pay interim relief to victims before 
ruling on the merits of the suit 
the order was not only without jurisdiction but wholly 
arbitrary perverse and displays a complete prejudgment nariman 
said 
deo said the petition was unusual since such requests normally 
are made to a higher court but he scheduled a hearing for june 16 
on the matter 
the court recesses saturday for summer vacation and returns june 
13 
nearly 3000 people were killed and at least 20000 seriously 
injured when toxic methylisocyanate leaked from a pesticide plant 
run by a subsidiary of union carbide in bhopal on dec 3 1984 
bhopal is the capital of the central indian state of madhya 
pradesh 
deo is the fourth judge in the case the first was promoted to 
the high court and the second withdrew after a serious auto injury 
the third judge gs patel was transferred to another court by 
the indian government after it was disclosed that he had filed a 
claim in the case 
vepa sarthy a lawyer for the indian government accused union 
carbide of filing its petition with a view to delay the case 
lawyer vibhuti jha a courtrecognized intervener on behalf 
of voluntary relief organizations helping the gas victims urged 
the judge to reject carbides request he described it as stalling 
deos december order that union carbide pay interim relief to 
the gas victims was upheld by the madhya pradesh high court on 
april 4 the high court set the amount of payment at 192 million 
union carbide earlier this week asked the high court to review 
its decision 
the multinational company with headquarters in danbury conn 
also faces criminal charges in connection with the gas leak 
india contends the gas leak was caused by negligence the 
company has said it resulted from sabotage by a distruntled 
employee

a chinese man dressed in a dapper 
pinstriped suit stepped out of a cramped baggage container after a 
15hour flight to freedom from beijing astonishing airport 
officials who said he was lucky to survive 
all he wanted was political asylum and freedom ron wilson 
community relations officer at san francisco international airport 
said thursday you would expect a guy to be dead when he 
arrived 
wilson said that instead of luggage a baggage handler on 
wednesday found a nattily clad cheng guajun in the fivefootsquare 
storage container in the belly of a boeing 747 belonging to the 
official airline of china 
immigration and naturalization service district director david 
ilchert would not say whether the man asked for asylum however he 
did say bilingual officers were interviewing him to find out his 
intentions 
he looked pretty dapper as soon as he got some fresh air 
said joseph f brandon chief of investigations for the ins in san 
francisco he seemed calm and collected in his thoughts he 
wasnt really emotional 
cheng 33 who said he ate a candy bar he brought with him for 
the trip told immigration investigators after he arrived wednesday 
that he had watched airport workers in china loading baggage into 
the containers for several days before deciding to hide in one 
wilson characterized the plan as daring but foolhardy since 
baggage compartments are not all pressurized and a person inside 
one could die from exposure 
the hold were the container was placed was a temperate 65 
degrees the cargo holds on a boeing 747 can range from 38 up to 85 
degrees depending on the location in the plane 
cheng said he was employed as an accountant by a chemical 
company in tianjin a major industrial city and port in northeast 
china 
cheng reportedly told ins investigators he had not been able to 
get a student visa to the united states because he could not prove 
he had a financial sponsor here cheng said he has an uncle in los

university of missouri nutritionist gretchen hill said her study 
shows kids can get a good breakfast on their own by getting the 
cereal box and some milk 
hill who presented her study thursday during the annual meeting 
of the federation of american societies for experimental biology 
said the research didnt suggest that cold cereal was the only good 
breakfast 
parents who feed their children wellbalanced breakfasts 
fruit toast lowfat milk some bacon and only three eggs weekly 
shouldnt change she said 
but if youre lazy and have to choose between doughnuts and 
cereal provide the cereal especially with lowfat milk she 
said the data was very clear that there are a lot of nutrients 
in that breakfast they might not get enough of in some other 
breakfast 
even a leading critic of sugar in breakfast cereals agreed with 
the studys conclusion 
cold cereal is a good breakfast but giving your child a 
fortified cereal is like giving them a vitamin pill said bonnie 
liebman nutrition director for the washingtonbased center for 
science in the public interest 
while most cereals are fortified parents should still try to 
choose the most healthful breakfast cereals those relatively low 
in sugar and those that are whole grain liebman said 
hill used data collected in l985 by the us department of 
agriculture for her study of 27 dietary components including 
calories protein vitamins minerals and fiber consumed during 
all three meals and snacks by 548 children ages 1 to 5 nationwide 
eleven skipped breakfast of the others about half ate 
readytoeat cereals the half that didnt eat cereals wasnt 
divided as to whether the children ate balanced breakfasts or not 
because hill simply wanted to know how the average cereal eater did 
compared with other children 
cereal eaters tended to receive significantly more vitamins a 
and b12 thiamine riboflavin niacin pyridoxine iron folic acid 
and zinc than noncereal eaters or breakfast skippers hill said 
cereal eaters also ate significantly less cholesterol and fat 
she said all three groups tended to get adequate protein and 
carbohydrate but breakfast skippers risked lowenergy and future 
bone ailments because they failed to meet recommended daily amounts 
of thiamine calcium and vitamin a and ate less fiber pyridoxine 
calcium magnesium zinc and copper 
hills study was financed by the missouri agricultural 
experiment station without support from cereal manufacturers she 
said 
liebman cautioned that a link between breakfast cereals and 
better overall nutrition doesnt prove cause and effect its 
possible these kids overall ate less fat and cholesterol because 
they came from families that are more nutritionconscious

a purification system failed at a gas refinery in 
the ural mountains and released a cloud of hydrogen sulphide that 
poisoned 52 people and contaminated a village beyond remedy a 
newspaper reported 
nine of the injured required hospitalization the sovietskaya 
rossiya daily said in its report thursday 
the leak occurred in muzhichya pavlovka near orenburg and the 
paper said the villages 844 residents would have to be resettled 
the problem began with the failure in early march of a gas 
purification unit the article said then on april 25 the duty 
engineer noticed a compressor malfunction 
the only right decision in that case was to stop pumping gas 
to the refinery the newspaper said the refinery released gas 
to burn instead which according to the local population has been 
the regular practice here 
ki akulov the soviet health official told the newspaper the 
refinery near orenburg and another in astrakhan on the caspian sea 
are dangerous to the public health and urged that corrective 
measures be taken 
still today none of the sulfur purification systems are 
operating at either refinery nor do automatic control systems to 
detect poisonous releases exist the threemile protective belt 
ordered in 1975 never was maintained around the refinery 
to make matters worse the newspaper said the ministry 
responsible for relocating the villagers does not plan to do it 
until 1990 or 1991

radio moscow reported today that work had resumed 
at the steel mill in southern poland where staterun media had 
reported that police broke up a strike 
on thursday a government spokesman said the kremlin regrets the 
labor unrest confronting its ally 
later thursday the official tass news agency reported that 
plainclothes polish agents entered the lenin steelworks in the 
krakow suburb of nowa huta before dawn to restore order to 
enable the majority of the labor collectives to resume work and to 
prevent further damage to the national economy 
it said the strike was broken up without incidents and that 
strike committee members were detained the agency did not mention 
the lockout at the lenin shipyard in polands baltic port of gdansk 
todays editions of the communist party daily pravda carried the 
tass report on page seven 
radio moscow without mentioning the situation in gdansk or nowa 
huta reported at noon thursday that 61 percent of the people 
surveyed in poland thought a strike wave that broke out there april 
25 would damage the economy 
at a regular news briefing thursday foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady i gerasimov was asked about the unrest and said we 
regret that such events take place in poland 
he declined to say whether soviet officials had offered advice 
or suggestions to the polish government about the situation 
polish workers are seeking pay increases of up to 60 percent to 
offset prices that have gone up 42 percent so far this year 
the strikers in gdansk and nowa huta also demand reinstatement 
of free trade unions and fired union activists and the release of 
political prisoners 
polands communist authorities have said the price increases are 
necessary to straighten out polands economic problems and the 
strikes damage the reform effort 
pravda on wednesday accused antipolish centers in the west 
and domestic dissidents of trying to exploit the unrest in poland 
before polish authorities stifled the solidarity free trade 
union movement with the december 1981 imposition of martial law 
soviet troops had massed on polands border and there was 
speculation they might intervene

india needed heavy water in 1983 when 15 
tons of the nuclear coolant vanished while being shipped from 
norway to west germany government records show 
an official with access to the records said today he did not 
know how india coped with the shortage another official at the 
ministry of science and technology flatly denied that the missing 
norwegian heavy water came to india 
both spoke on condition they not be further identified 
the oslo newspaper verdens gang reported april 21 that 15 tons 
of heavy water was flown on a liberianregistered west african 
airlines plane via basel switzerland to dubai 
the paper said it then probably went to a nuclear reactor in 
bombay 
the records show that five years ago india needed to import 
heavy water to augment its own stock so it could commission a 
235megawatt uraniumfueled reactor at kalpakkam 50 miles south 
of madras in southern tamil nadu state 
the commissioning of the plant was to take place in 1982 but it 
was delayed for lack of heavy water the official said 
the plant finally went into operation on jan 27 1984 several 
months after the norwegian consignment went astray 
the government official could not say where india got heavy 
water for the kalpakkam plant 
heavy water or deuterium oxide looks like ordinary water but 
has an extra neutron and cools a nuclear reactor by moderating the 
speed of neutrons released in a chain reaction 
it enables the reactor to run on natural uranium instead of 
enriched uranium fuel and to produce plutonium which can be used 
for nuclear weapons 
indias nuclear power program has been based on natural uranium 
and heavy water 
the official at the ministry of science and technology said that 
when india needs extra heavy water it is imported from the soviet 
union 
norway refuses to sell heavy water to india because it has not 
signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
india has refused to sign the agreement because it believes it 
discriminates against developing countries by preserving nuclear 
capabilities for a few developed nations 
india has six heavy water plants

government officials in the third joint excavation of a us 
warplane crash site the searchers are trying to account for 555 
americans who didnt return home from laos during the indochina war

a recent epidemic of deformed birds and 
a decline in the populations of certain bird types is a warning the 
earth may still be on the path to ecological disaster a leading 
ecologist warned 
there may yet be a silent spring in our future stanford 
university ecologist paul r ehrlich told a gathering thursday at 
the peninsula conservation center in palo alto about 30 miles 
south of san francisco 
ehrlich coauthor of the birders handbook a natural 
history of north american birds referred to rachel carsons 
prediction of environmental deterioration in her 1962 book silent 
spring 
the book said to have galvanized the us environmental 
movement warned that if pesticide spraying was not controlled 
entire ecological system could be thrown out of balance 
because pesticide use is now better regulated some of the 
danger has passed said ehrlich but like the miners canaries 
of old birds still serve as an environmental early warning 
system 
the clearing of us forests has led to a decline in warblers 
and other songbirds and toxics found in agricultural runoff are 
creating mutations among other bird species ehrlich said 
birds are quite sensitive to poisons in the environment and 
as a result an epidemic of deformed birds has recently hit the 
united states said ehrlich 
it appears to be connected with high concentrations of 
selenium mercury and other toxic elements in agricultural runoff 
and drainage from mines and power plants he said 
duck and loon populations have declined in areas where acid rain 
has destroyed the aquatic insects fish and other prey in lakes and 
marshes where birds breed he said

mayor eugene sawyer says hell call a conference 
of community and religious leaders to heal our wounds after a 
fiveday controversy that led to an aides firing because of 
racist antisemitic remarks 
sawyer dismissed steve cokely on thursday under mounting 
pressure from the city council and community groups the mayor said 
he acted after consulting with a broadlybased multiracial 
group 
as mayor i will not tolerate any racial divisiveness from any 
employee sawyer said im sensitive and i heard from a lot of 
people and i took time to work through the process 
at issue in the controversy were statements cokely made in a 
series of lectures from 1985 through 1987 they were taperecorded 
and made available for sale at a store run by followers of nation 
of islam leader louis farrakhan 
cokely the mayors special projects coordinator said in the 
lectures that doctors especially jewish ones were infecting 
blacks with aids and other diseases cokely like sawyer is black 
he also called christopher columbus a hispanic jew who 
brought slaves to america and said columbus day was a white 
supremacist holiday cokely also labeled the christian cross a 
symbol of white supremacy 
the 35yearold aide whose remarks were made public in weekend 
newspaper reports apologized monday and sawyer said then he had a 
talk with the aide to rehabilitate steve 
however the mayor who had been told by jewish leaders weeks 
ago about cokelys remarks came under fire for his delay in taking 
action 
it was my thought that steve cokely should have been 
terminated immediately said alderman timothy evans one of the 
mayors political opponents it was not done and it was a 
mistake 
at a rally thursday night after his firing cokely told about 
150 cheering supporters that he was dismissed from the 
35000ayear job because he was getting too powerful 
there was a plot to force me to resign cokely said 
mayoral aide monroe anderson described cokely as a gofer who 
goes to groups in the black community listens sometimes talks 
and then reports to the mayor about the concerns of those groups

researchers who put swimsuitclad women 
in drafty rooms and dunked them in cool water say women who often 
complain of the cold may be consuming too little iron 
if you are cold a lot of the time or cold when other people 
arent then you might have a physician check your blood iron 
levels said pennsylvania state university nutritionist john l 
beard 
physiologist henry lukaski who conducted another study linking 
iron deficiency to feelings of chilliness among women said women 
should ask their doctors to test blood levels of an ironcarrying 
protein called ferritin a more accurate indicator of mild iron 
deficiency than measurement of hemoglobin the ironcontaining 
protein that makes blood red 
beard and lukaski of the us department of agricultures human 
nutrition research center in grand forks nd presented their 
studies thursday at the annual meeting of the federation of 
american societies for experimental biology 
lukaski said men also can feel cold due to iron deficiency but 
far fewer do so than women men tend to get more iron because they 
eat more while women lose iron through menstruation he said 
he said women who suffer mild iron deficiency should eat more 
lean red meat and other highiron foods including fish poultry 
beans beets and leafy green vegetables and should drink orange 
juice to enhance iron uptake 
ironrich foods are preferable to iron supplements because 
organic iron is more readily absorbed by the body than inorganic 
iron supplements lukaski said however beard said iron 
supplements are practical and adequate if taken over a long time 
beards study compared eight women who were very irondeficient 
with 10 women who had normal iron levels both groups had equal 
percentages of body fat and the experiment was designed to 
eliminate bias caused by differences in diet and menstrual cycle 
the women were submerged up to their necks for 100 minutes in 
82degree water 166 degrees below normal body temperature 
beard found the irondeficient womens body temperatures dropped 
an average of 125 degrees fahrenheit compared with a drop of 
threefourths of a degree in the normal women 
thyroid hormone which increases body metabolism to produce 
heat didnt increase as much in the irondeficient women as in the 
others irondeficient women also used 13 percent less oxygen 
indicating they generated less body heat 
but after the anemic women took iron tablets for 12 weeks to 
reverse their condition all the differences vanished 
lukaski and usda scientist clint hall had six women wear 
twopiece bathing suits and sit in a room with a cool draft on two 
occasions 
the first time after eating an lowiron diet for 80 days the 
women started to shiver after an average of 84 minutes 
then the women ate a diet with almost the recommended daily 
amount of iron for 84 days followed by iron supplements for 16 
days the women shivered after an average of 92 minutes 
lukaski also found that when the women were irondeficient 
their body temperatures fell about 11 degrees compared with 
onehalf a degree after they ate the diet with more iron 
in addition the women produced more thyroid hormone and two to 
three times more norepineprine when they had adequate iron 
norepinephrine is a stress hormone that tells the body to produce 
heat lukaski said 
he said previous studies found about 30 percent of american 
women dont get enough iron the recommended daily amount is 18 
milligrams for women who menstruate and 15 milligrams for men and 
for older women

cia director william webster says he questions 
the wisdom of indicting foreign leaders such as military strongman 
manuel antonio noriega of panama on drug charges according to an 
interview published today 
there has to be some advance thinking about where these 
actions take us and whether they do in fact help the drug 
enforcement counternarcotics program or create some confusion 
the former fbi chief and federal judge told the washington times 
what do we intend to do with these indictments he asked 
do we intend to pursue extradition are we going to seek to 
overthrow by whatever means we have economic military political 
as a result of the indictment 
meanwhile the wall street journal reported today that president 
reagan has ordered the cia to begin using clandestine radio 
broadcasts leaflets and rumormongering against noriega 
the cia agreed to undertake the propaganda campaign after the 
agency rejected state department propopals for financial or 
paramilitary aid to antinoriega forces the newspaper said even 
before the new program gets going it said its launching is being 
complicated by the pentagons refusal to let the cia use us 
military bases to broadcast antinoriega messages 
noriega faces federal drug charges in florida but negotiations 
aimed at getting him to step down include arrangements not to seek 
his extradition 
still webster said he has confidence that noriega can be 
persuaded if thats the nice word for it induced to step down 
if the current pressures are not significantly relaxed and other 
pressures are considered 
when asked if us policy had failed in panama he said i 
dont think its lost the only thing thats going to get lost is 
maybe some face of those who made wild predictions that he would 
roll over and play dead the first time we barked at him

the new leader of northern georgias roman 
catholics promised them his status as the nations first black 
archbishop would not hamper his relationship with his mostly white 
parishioners 
there can be no escaping the fact that i am the first black 
bishop to serve in atlanta and the first black archbishop in the 
nation archbishop eugene a marino told the thousands of people 
attending his installation mass thursday 
having noted that i hasten my deep personal conviction that 
it need not affect the quality of my ministry among you nor the 
nature of our relationship with each other he said prompting 
prolonged applause 
the archdiocese of atlanta covers 69 counties in north georgia 
with a catholic population of about 156000 including about 10000 
blacks only two of the approximately 200 priests in the 
archdiocese are black about five of the 65 parishes are 
predominantly black 
many of the nations highest ranking roman catholic leaders 
attended thursdays mass including cardinal joseph bernardin of 
chicago cardinal bernard law of boston and retired cardinal john 
krol of philadelphia 
in addition more than 800 clergy including nearly 100 roman

the overflow crowd at the atlanta civic center warmly received 
marino a native of biloxi miss applauding as he entered the 
hall and interrupting his homily several times with more applause 
i come to you today with neither pretense nor apology 
marino said 
like so many of you i am a southerner my roots go deep into 
the rich brown soil of mississippi and back to puerto rico and 
africa i was born and raised in the deep south the old south with 
its curious mixture of aristocratic gentility and gracious 
hospitality on the one hand and racial segregation on the other 
marino said 
although at times embarrassed today i am unashamed from 
whence i have come the experience of the old south has profoundly 
influenced all of us black and white suffering through that 
experience has laid the foundation of the new south so beautifully 
and dramatically typified by this city today i happy to be a 
citizen of atlanta 
among the local leaders attending the mass were coretta scott 
king and martin luther king iii along with other relatives of the 
late rev martin luther king jr and mayor andrew young himself a

a poliostricken executive at a burning 
rocket fuel plant chose to stay behind and call the fire department 
rather than flee and that cost his life and the life of another 
man who apparently tried to help plant officials say 
shortly after leroy westerfield made his call an 
earthquakeforce explosion obliterated the pacific engineering 
production co building and 11 others in the industrial complex 
killing two and injuring more than 255 people 
bruce bernard halker 56 a friend of westerfield apparently 
died while he tried to coax the crippled man from the inferno 
coworkers say westerfield 62 had been partially paralyzed by 
polio since he was 19 
if he was there hell stay around until everyone gets out 
said halkers wife roma as she awaited word of his fate that 
plant was his whole life 
the body of halker vice president for operations was found 
several hours after the initial blast and several that followed 
authorities spent thursday scouring the charred rubble of the plant 
hoping to find a trace of the popular westerfield the companys 
controller for 28 years 
we lost two of our very closest friends said fred gibson 
the plant chairman 
production of a key fuel component for the space shuttle and 
us military rockets was halted until manufacturers ascertain the 
equipment malfunction that caused the fire and explosions which 
left widespread property damage throughout the las vegas valley 
union officials said thursday they had complained about safety 
at pacific engineering but plant officials denied a bad safety 
record 
this plant is in my opinion one of the worst i have ever 
been into john molovich safety and heath technician with the 
international steelworkers union said in a letter following a 
september 1982 tour of the plant the letter was released thursday 
i cannot understand how this plant has not been blown off the 
face of the earth given the product it manufactures molovich 
wrote 
weve had people burned weve had people blown up minor 
explosions that severely injured workers said jim thompson 
president of steelworkers union local 4856 
gibson responded it is a safe plant and i am stating there 
have been no fires there we had inspections from osha and we had 
no continuing problems with anything 
laury lewis general manager of the state industrial insurance 
system said his records indicate pacific engineering has always 
been a pretty good risk his records he said indicated no 
previous multiple injury problems or explosions 
plant employees many of them wearing bandages gathered in the 
community center in this town of 55000 on thursday to discuss the 
disaster and observe a moment of silence for westerfield and halker 
tears welling in his eyes westerfields son gary said he was 
not surprised his father risked death to save his coworkers 
that was his style the son said 
his polio got so bad he could barely get around said plant 
foreman robert thayer a friend of nearly three decades it 
didnt affect his mind one bit 
keith rucker the companys general counsel said people at the 
plant tried to get westerfield to leave when a fire spread out of 
control in the plants drying room 
its my understanding he said no because he had to call 
the fire department rucker said gary westerfield listened to a 
tape of the call to fire officials that was my fathers voice 
he said 
pacific engineering is one of two plants in the united states 
that makes ammonium perchlorate a fuel oxidizer for the space 
shuttles solid rocket boosters and the militarys mx minuteman 
and titan missiles the other is kerrmcgee whose plant is just a 
mile away from the site of wednesdays destruction 
the explosions the most powerful of which was registered at 35 
on the richter scale of ground motion twisted steel girders like 
pretzels and turned some of the 40 cars parked nearby into chunks 
of melted metal 
concussions from the blasts shattered windows 10 miles away in 
las vegas jolted airliners in flight peeled off roofs upended 
cars and threw workers through walls broken windows and cracked 
foundations were common in henderson 
area schools closed for a week so inspectors could determine if 
buildings were safe damage estimates were still uncertain thursday 
us sen harry reid dnev toured the site after asking 
president reagan in a letter to declare henderson a federal 
emergency disaster area a move that would open the door to 
lowinterest loans to enable residents to repair damage

the socialist labor party made strong gains in 
local balloting and overtook prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservatives in the first electoral test of her thirdterm 
program returns indicated today 
the election thursday was fought on the national issues of a 
thatcherinspired shakeup of the welfare system this spring and 
plans for a new property tax property taxes together with central 
government grants fund local governments 
the results are a major rebuff to the governments policies 
the country has said enough is enough said labor party general 
secretary larry whitty after the daylong balloting thursday 
the labor party kept major prizes including birmingham 
britains secondlargest city and the scottish capital edinburgh 
it also took control of the university city of cambridge 
with results declared from 207 of the 211 local governments 
contested in the daylong ballot labor had net gains of 107 seats 
the conservatives had lost three and the centrists lost 74 the 
british domestic news agency press association calculated 
the conservatives had control of 48 of the contested cities and 
towns up seven labor had 97 up six and the centrist social 
democratic and liberal party had six unchanged 
the rest were controlled by independents scottish natonalists 
or had no party with overall control 
despite the apparent edge to labor the conservatives posted 
gains in the prosperous south and captured seven city councils no 
one party had controlled previously 
the big loser was the thirdplace social and liberal democratic 
party it was formed in march to merge the centrists but a 
breakaway faction remains a separate party 
critics charge that mrs thatcher is going too far with 
rightwing policies and the latest moves on welfare and taxes are 
unfair to the poor 
a british broadcasting corp computer analysis showed that labor 
took 39 percent of the vote a ninepoint jump since the june 
general election while the conservatives had 37 percent five 
points down and the centrists with 18 percent suffered a 
fourpoint drop 
environment secretary nicholas ridley said that considering the 
controversy over the welfare and property tax changes the tories 
did rather well 
david steel social and liberal democratic party coleader 
said im not pretending weve done well but it has been an 
awfully difficult year for us 
the election in which about 20 million britons were eligible to 
vote involved about 4000 seats that were last contested in 1984 
onethird of seats on the local authorities in england and wales 
and the entire councils in the 53 scottish districts were at stake 
there were no elections this year in london and northern ireland 
the conservatives humiliated in scotland in the june general 
election again failed to make headway there they remained in 
control of just a handful of small councils in scotland while 
labor added the major city of aberdeen to its collection of 
scottish victories 
the welfare changes are part of an ambitious program by mrs 
thatcher to end what the conservatives term britains dependency 
culture nutured by the welfare state 
under the new property tax now having a rough ride through 
parliament taxes would be levied on each individual adult in a 
household 
under the old system the tax was levied only on each individual 
property regardless of how many people lived there the new 
flatrate system dubbed a poll tax by critics will treble the 
bill for some households 
mrs thatcher believes that making everyone pay will bring home 
the cost of electing leftwing local authorities the big spenders

the communist party daily pravda today heaped 
praise on chinese reforms that have attracted foreign investment 
and it called for a rebirth of the work ethic to bring similar 
prosperity to the soviet union 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has made favorable references to 
recent chinese economic experiments but pravdas article was the 
most complimentary report yet on reform in the neighboring 
communist state 
todays article on chinas tianjin region one of 14 open 
economic zones set forth a list of accomplishments and credited an 
inspired workforce for the success of chinese perestroika 
perestroika is the name of gorbachevs reform program that 
aims to rebuild the soviet economy and society soviet proponents 
of perestroika which means rebuilding have encouraged broader 
use of joint ventures to draw foreign investment to soviet industry 
but an array of problems faces the foreign businessman in the 
soviet union they include low worker productivity unreliable 
delivery of supplies poor storage and transportation facilities 
and a lack of convenient and comfortable accommodations 
chinas open economic zones contain only 8 percent of the 
nations population but account for more than a quarter of its 
industrial production and 40 percent of all exports pravda said 
the zones were created four years ago 
the authoritative newspaper said the special economic zones had 
been successful in attracting foreign capital and joint ventures 
because the chinese built support facilities needed for 
international trade 
in the tianjin region architecturally unique buildings 
literally pop up like a mirage in the desert pravda said it 
reported that the regions developers built luxury hotels a golf 
course sports clubs and other services that make western 
businessmen feel comfortable 
transport problems also were worked out ahead of time to ensure 
enough shipping capacity to foreign customers and a lenient tax 
system has drawn more foreign investment each year the newspaper 
said 
pravda said the tianjin region alone had 80 contracts for 
jointventure enterprises and that capital investment in the region 
last year exceeded 100 million

south carolina may soon get a new symbol 
because some elementary school students bugged the general assembly 
the house on thursday overwhelmingly passed a bill to make the 
praying mantis the state insect the senate had taken similar 
action in march gov carroll campbell also supports the proposal 
spokesman tucker eskew said 
rep woody aydlette whose lighthearted promotion of the 
cockroach was rejected did succeed in adding an amendment that 
would require a threefourths vote instead of a majority vote in 
the general assembly to adopt state symbols 
aydlette said its a waste of legislators time and taxpayers 
money to add to the already long list of state symbols 
the students in the dacusvillecrosswell enrichment program in 
perkins county initiated the legislation as part of a class project 
to learn how the legislative process works dacusville elementary 
school assistant principal tammy hamlin said thursday 
they realized the state didnt have an insect and went to 
work she said 
the students did research to determine the proper insect to 
represent the state and voted for the praying mantis 
the students got their state senator nell smith to propose the 
bill came to columbia to testify wrote letters to legislators and 
crafted praying mantis brochures bumper stickers and buttons 
the lobbying was extensive said state rep larry martin a 
dacusville elementary school alumnus 
when the bill hit a snag in the house the children wrote and 
called the legislators who opposed it and convinced all of them but 
aydlette to remove their objections martin said

then they have agreed that they will begin serious and earnest 
conversations about the full democratization of the country 
wright said i remain hopeful he added despite continued 
mistrust between the two sides 
on thursday wright joined the reagan administration in 
expressing concern that the rebels not be left on the losing side 
of an unbalanced equation in the ceasefire talks 
the message will be given to the sandinista government 
that the majority in the congress would not look with favor at all 
on any return or resort to military engagement wright dtexas 
told reporters 
representatives from the rebels political directorate the 
nicaraguan resistance were in washington this week arguing their 
case before state department officials members of congress and the 
news media they accused the leftist government of dragging its 
feet in the peace talks in order to stall us humanitarian aid 
for the rebels 
adolfo calero leader of the contra directorate said the 48 
million aid package passed a month ago was intended to keep the 
rebels alive as a fighting force inside nicaragua during a 60day 
truce while negotiations went forward on a longerterm cease fire 
that is being thwarted by the sandinistas he said its 
broken down in nicaragua there are no steps being taken at 
present toward reconciliation 
wright said he had asked state department officials at a meeting 
earlier in the day to expedite aid money to the rebels including 
at least part of 10 million earmarked to pay the expenses of a 
verification commission to oversee the peace process 
without aid soon he said the pressure would be entirely on 
the contras they would wither on the vine and there would be no 
incentive for the sandinistas to negotiate in good faith 
but he said congress wants equally to avoid giving the rebels 
the false impression that we want them to rev up the war 
again and admonished the contra leaders to continue peace 
efforts 
a near miracle happened at esquipulas the town in guatemala 
where the original regional peace accord was signed last aug 7 
the house leader said a near miracle happened march 23 at 
sapoa when the two sides agreed to a 60day ceasefire lets 
work for the third miracle 
we assured him we would continue to make it work said 
enrique bermudez the rebel military commander who joined the 
directorate in a meeting with wright we will make an effort to 
continue negotiating 
discussions on a longterm cease fire have bogged down and the 
situation has been complicated by a dispute in contra ranks over 
negotiating strategy and who is to provide military leadership a 
split bermudez said was being patched up 
criticism was harsh at the white house where presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater accused the sandinista regime of 
systematic moves to undermine the peace process and 
intimidate its political opposition 
fitzwater pointed to reports from managua that police detained 
opposition leaders suspended two radio stations from broadcasting 
and closed one station for 24 hours he said nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega had once again held his true colors high showing 
that he has little intention of supporting a free press of 
allowing democratic dissent or making the reforms called for by the 
guatemala city peace plan 
the ceasefire agreement allows the rebels to receive 
humanitarian aid inside nicaragua if they gather in ceasefire 
zones and the aid is delivered by a neutral agent the only 
shipments thus far have been to rebels based on the honduran side 
of the border 
at a news conference calero accused the sandinistas of trying 
to force the rebels into a choice between hunger and surrender 
he said the insurgents refuse to accept that choice and will not 
enter the seven ceasefire zones which have been mutually agreed to 
if there is no assurance of delivery of the aid which has been 
approved 
much of the current problem stems from disagreement over who 
should deliver the aid the contras had favored a hondurasbased 
company circle g but the sandinistas rejected it because of past 
work it had done for the cia wright said several other companies 
are now under consideration including the costa rican national 
airline 
wright said later after meeting with rebel leaders that there 
appeared to be no immediate threat of starvation to the contra 
troops but said the leaders were most fearful that a prolonged aid 
drought would increase morale problems

for as long as most residents can 
remember elliott trueluck has walked downtown to a coffee shop 
each morning singing and talking to a pack of dog yelping at his 
heels 
last week however a police officer opened fire on truelucks 
canine followers killing at least two of them now the disabled 
veteran says hes afraid to go out into the streets of this small 
southeastern georgia town 
it scared the idontknowwhat out of me recalled 
trueluck 61 who is described by his wife as a shellshock 
victim of world war ii i did what that police officer told me 
to do and got out of there what if he had turned the gun on me 
instead of the dogs 
harriett dixon director of the okefenokee humane society in 
nearby waycross said police sgt james mock killed several dogs on 
april 29 with shotgun blasts and then used a billy club to beat 
wounded dogs to death 
warrants obtained by the humane society and a witness charge 
mock with cruelty to animals for allegedly shooting and clubbing 
the dogs he is free on 500 bond 
mayor harry adams said mock shot the dogs on orders from city 
hall after trueluck had laughed off warnings to keep the animals 
off city streets an ordinance requires that dogs be leashed when 
out of their owners yards 
but several people who work at a neaby shopping center said 
unleashed dogs belonging to prominent white citizens roam the 
center ignored by police while their owners are inside trueluck 
is black 
the actions taken by the policeman in this case are considered 
just and proper the mayor said at a news conference today he 
was performing his duty in accordance with prescribed procedures 
adams said the dogs killed by mock were considered mean vicious 
and a threat to the community he said the city has decided to buy 
a tranquilizer gun as a result of the incident 
witnesses disputed the mayors contention that the dogs were 
dangerous 
ive walked right by them on the sidewalk and all they did was 
wag their tails said judy thompson who witnessed the shooting 
its bad to think you live in a town where the cops just pull up 
and go to shooting 
we watched him every day said another witness rebecca 
jacobson he had different dogs with him every day hed walk and 
they would follow him if one of them strayed hed sing 
the attack occurred as trueluck was returning home with at least 
eight dogs from his favorite coffee shop in this timber and farming 
community about 100 miles southwest of savannah ms jacobson said 
she was working in a drug store at the shopping center when she 
heard the shots 
i ran out he was out there beating them with a stick 
there was one injured dog that was trying to get away hed run a 
little and sit down we could tell hed been shot in the back 
city officials said mock killed two dogs but mrs dixon 
contends that as many as six others may have been hauled off by 
city sanitation workers before she arrived at the scene 
police chief dennis martin said he has asked the georgia bureau 
of investigation to conduct an independent probe to determine if 
any of the states anticruelty statutes had been violated 
my officers havent done anything wrong the chief added 
truelucks wife myrtice said he receives a small disability 
check every month because he has never recovered from being shell 
shocked while serving as a marine in the pacific during world war 
ii a symptom of his condition is that he laughs at almost 
everything

hundreds of police carrying clubs ringed 
the strikebound lenin shipyard today and workers inside said they 
expected an assault workers at a huge southern steel mill said a 
raid by riot troops had not ended their strike 
the roman catholic church criticized the police raid at nowa 
huta steel plant outside krakow and said authorities apparently was 
planning similar action against the shipyard workers 
the the government moved in draft legislation to punish 
organizers of strikes and any forms of protest with up to one 
years imprisonment the draft also suspends the already limited 
right to strike by officially recognized trade unions 
the nowa huta strike began april 26 after a successful oneday 
stoppage by transit workers in the northwestern city of bydgoszcz 
touched off polands worst wave of labor unrest since the 1981 
military crackdown on the independent solidarity union federation 
the staterun radio said today work had resumed but workers 
said the strike was still on 
the church statement issued in warsaw came as three 
churchappointed mediators told reporters they felt betrayed by the 
police attack thursday because an agreement had been within reach 
to end the 10day strike 
staterun media reports said the gdansk shipyards director 
warned strikers in a message broadcast over loudspeakers during the 
night to leave or he would resort to other means 
a pole who spent the night in the yard said about 2000 strikers 
were inside and its very tense you can see they are all under 
great stress 
the workers began to worry about their low food supplies with 
supporters outside no longer allowed to bring gifts of bread 
it seems they are going to use a different scenario than in 
nowa huta said senior polish dissident adam michnik they 
probably want to take the shipyard by hunger 
during the night police convoys periodically moved about this 
baltic port in a show of force inside the shipyard solidarity 
lead lech walesa circulated among young strikers and vowed to be 
the last to leave the yard where solidarity was born 
a note from strikers smuggled out of the shipyard thursday 
evening said as far as we know they the authorities are 
preparing for a police raid the strike at the 12000worker 
shipyard began monday 
the government proposal to punish strikers was contained in a 
previously announced bill to give the state special powers to speed 
up its economic reform program the draft was obtained by western 
news agencies in warsaw 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski said in march that the 
government might require special powers to speed up its plans to 
reform the ailing economy 
solidarity says it generally favors the direction of the reforms 
but a statement by walesa received today from inside the 
shipyard said that society must be the coauthor and partner in 
the solutions 
wage demands fueled by rapid inflation this year have threatened 
to derail the economic reform program the government said this 
week announcing that it would ask for the special powers 
in the draft which has yet to be presented to parliament the 
government would be empowered to change management structures 
order layoffs of workers order liquidations breakups or mergers 
of companies and fire managers 
it also would allow for a freeze of wages and prices 
opposition activists said at least 32 strikers including a man 
whose legs were broken had to be treated for beatings suffered 
when security forces stormed the steelworks thursday 
the government denied anyone was injured in the predawn raid 
the rev tadeusz zaleski who was with the strikers during the 
raid said riot police were beating people with very long heavy 
sticks he said they destroyed the altar where he said mass for 
workers 
in its statement the church said we express deep sorrow that 
an attempt of dialogue and social conciliation did not bring the 
expected results 
on wednesday the church had sent mediators to both trouble 
spots with the approval of authorities the statement said 
we feel shocked that in the course of the talks which in 
parts were very encouraging the talks were brutally stopped 
said one of the mediators andrzej stelmachowski 
a combine official said on staterun radio today that the plant 
was quiet and strenuous work was going on the radio also said 
plant workers would this month receive 25 percent raises half of 
what the strikers had demanded 
the bydgoszcz strike and a twoday stoppage at another steel 
mill ended with promises of pay raises to offset 42 percent price 
increases 
in addition to higher pay the nowa huta and gdansk strikers 
demand reinstatement of free trade unions and fired solidarity 
activists and the release of political prisoners 
solidarity was born after a wave of strikes in august 1980 and 
was banned two years later 
three times in postwar poland labor unrest that followed price 
increases has toppled governments

police arrested an arabamerican leader of the 
palestinian civil disobedience movement and ordered him deported 
israeli officials said today a government spokesman accused him of 
advocating violence 
police arrested a jewish settler in the shooting death of a 
palestinian shepherd another shepherd was wounded in the eye in 
the incident 
israel radio reported that troops shot and wounded a 15yearold 
arab boy in antioccupation unrest today in the gaza strip town of 
khan yunis 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said us ambassador 
thomas pickering would protest the ordered deportation of mubarak 
awad who was arrested at his jerusalem home at midnight 6 pm 
edt thursday us embassy officials said they had no information 
on such a protest 
in 1985 awad established the center for nonviolent studies in 
jerusalem which calls on palestinians to peacefully resist the 
israeli occupation of arab lands captured during the 1967 middle 
east war 
leaders of the 5monthold palestinian uprising have adopted 
many elements of awads nonviolence strategy awad also provided 
tours and information to foreign journalists covering the unrest 
avi pazner spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
awad was ordered deported because he had gone beyond his calls for 
nonviolent protest and was responsible for leaflets that urged 
palestinians to throw gasoline bombs and stones 
this is preaching violence pazner said adding that awad 
had also called for a palestinian state that would include all of 
israel 
awad said today he supported the establishment of a palestinian 
state alongside israel his lawyer jonathan kuttab told the 
associated press 
kuttab met awad today in jail and was preparing an appeal 
against his deportation 
awad said the deportation order came because the palestinians 
were showing restraint and using civil disobedience kuttab said 
the move to expel awad followed a crackdown on leaders of the 
uprising 20 of whom have been deported to lebanon 
israel has also jailed 21 arab journalists including one 
thursday in an effort to stifle news coverage of the proests 
benjamin yaari deputy legal adviser of the interior ministry 
said awad was given the deportation order thursday and that he has 
three days to appeal to israels supreme court 
awad 44 who also has a home in wapakoneta ohio was in israel 
under a tourist visa that expired last november and he refused an 
order to leave the country awad was allowed to remain following 
strong us pressure against the previous expulsion order

editor of the arab weekly al awdah and of the palestine press 
service the authorities have closed the arabrun press service and 
al awdah which also has an english edition

least 48 hours for investigation on charges of incitement to riot 
the palestinian death toll in the uprising that began dec 8 
rose to 184 thursday after a confrontation near the west bank 
village of turmus aiya 17 miles northeast of jerusalem

several palestinian shepherds in a field the woman panicked and 
called for help and armed settlers as well as arab villagers 
rushed to the scene

israel radio identified the suspect as yisrael zeev a us 
immigrant police had no immediate comment

a french secret agent convicted of manslaughter in 
the 1985 bombing of an antinuclear protest ship off new zealand 
was freed today from exile at a french military base in the pacific 
because she is pregnant premier jacques chirac said 
chirac said the return of capt dominique prieur respects a 
unmediated accord with new zealand under which she was held 
but new zealand criticized mrs prieurs release as a breach 
of frances obligation under international law 
mrs prieur 38 and alain mafart 37 were arrested after the 
july 1985 aukland harbor bombing of the rainbow warrior a ship of 
the environmental group greenpeace it was preparing to lead a 
protest flotilla to mururoa a south pacific island where france 
conducts underground nuclear tests 
a dutch crewman on the rainbow warrior was killed in the bombing 
mrs prieur is now pregnant and the accord foresaw that in 
this circumstance she should be returned to paris the premier 
said during a stop in the town of agen where he was campaigning for 
sundays runoff against president francois mitterrand 
the new zealand opposition national party leader jim bolger a 
strong critic of the un accord said the repatriations of mrs 
prieur and mafart showed the original deal was worthless 
mafart was brought back to france in december after complaining 
of a stomach disorder new zealand officials have tried and failed 
to force the return of mafart who completed entrance examinations 
for a french war college since returning to the mainland 
bolger said chirac clearly believed he would benefit by bringing 
both agents home before the election 
a defense ministry spokesman had said previously that the return 
one year early from exile concerned the person of mrs prieur 
speaking on condition of anonymity he said she had left the atoll 
of hao but did not say when she would arrive in mainland france 
he said the government was surprised at the protests from new 
zealand prime minister david lange 
in a statement issued by its amsterdam office londonbased 
greenpeace said it was surprised and angered about mrs 
prieurs return to france 
the greenpeace statement said the dutch government was either 
informed about the intention to release prieur or it was lied to 
in that respect 
last month a dutch foreign ministry official traveled to the 
hoa atoll to investigate the terms of mrs prieurs detention 
the two agents were sentenced to 10 years in prison after 
pleading guilty to manslaughter but under the agreement negotiated 
by un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar new zealand 
turned the agents over to france on the condition that they stay at 
a military base on hao near mururoa until july 1989 
the accord had stipulated that the two could not leave the 
island without the consent of new zealand 
as part of the agreement paris apologized for the bombing paid 
7 million compensation and promised not to block new zealand 
exports to europe 
mrs prieur is married to joel prieur who was a paris 
firefighter at the time of her arrest and now works for the defense 
ministry he has visited her frequently since her transfer to hao

him so he could avoid a threeday suspension 
i would suggest it to any parent who is trying to understand a 
problem at school or worried about why their kids grade dropped 
said ms crampton whose son allen was suspended for acting up in 
class 
when boonsboro high school officials decided to suspend the 
sophomore ms crampton decided it was more important to keep him 
in school she proposed to join him and the school took her offer 
up 
they get zeros for all the work they miss and that brings 
their grade down and he couldnt afford to have his grades go 
down ms crampton said thursday after her third and final day of 
classes 
her son was less than enthusiastic 
its terrible he said he didnt elaborate 
ms crampton a 1972 graduate of boonsboro high said her first 
day back in school was a little stressful shes a smoker but 
could not light up 
in fact i got caught chewing gum in english class i had to 
spit it out she said

were coming home he asked me if it was my last day he was glad to 
have it over with

president najib of afghanistan said 
today he stood ready to bring moslem rebels into his government but 
that his army would fight them if necessary 
the soviet union which has been backing his socialist 
government is scheduled to withdraw its estimated 115000 troops 
from afghanistan starting may 15 some diplomats have said the 
departure of soviet soldiers will leave najibs forces unable to 
repel the ussupplied guerrillas who already control much of the 
country 
but najib said today after a threeday visit to india that his 
army would deal a heavy and severe blow to the pakistanbased 
guerrillas if they continue to fight 
the rebels have refused to participate in any government headed 
by najib 
asked today at his news conference if he would step aside as 
president to facilitate what he calls national reconciliation 
najib replied i would like to tell you that the afghan loya 
jirga national assembly was convened last november and endorsed 
the new constitution of the republic and elected the president for 
a sevenyear term najibs mandate would end november 1994 
najib said the mujahedeen are actually doing a political 
suicide by refusing to talk with his government 
meanwhile a mujahedeen statement issued today in new delhi 
attacked what it called indias misconceived policy of taking 
the side of the criminal regime of kabul 
the afghan president met prime minister rajiv gandhi and several 
top government officials during his stay in new delhi both the 
afghans and indians have talked of warm relations between the two 
countries who share a common enemy in pakistan 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to prop up 
the socialist government against attacks by islamic guerrillas the 
soviet withdrawal is scheduled to begin under an agreement signed 
last month by the soviet union the united states afghanistan and 
pakistan 
the soviet news agency tass said today that more than 10000 
refugees were returning to afghanistan each day it gave no details 
and did not say when the number rose to that level 
a week earlier officials in the afghan capital of kabul said 
130000 refugees had returned since january 1986 
at least 3 million afghans have fled their country during the 
decadelong civil war they are mostly housed in refugee camps in 
pakistan and iran and the kabul leadership is attempting to draw 
them back to afghanistan as soviet troops begin to withdraw 
najib said today the deposed afghan king zahir shah was also 
free to return home to participate in politics 
he was overthrown in 1973 by a cousin who was assassinated in 
1978 afghan refugees and some western officials have suggested 
that the deposed kings return might pave the way for a transition 
of government 
an indian official speaking after najibs news conference said 
india had played an informal role in talking with the ousted king 
as well as the united states the soviet union and pakistan 
speaking on condition of anonymity he added the impression 
we gathered from the afghans is that they are trying to broaden 
the base of their government 
najib also said he had rejected a petition by foreign reporters 
to free an italian journalist and a french photographer jailed on 
espionage charges he said the two men who were captured after 
entering afghanistan with the mujahedeen had engaged in 
subversive activities

doctors orders are not always followed by lab 
technicians and clerks but sometimes thats good according to a 
study published today 
the study of two hospitals reported in the journal of the 
american medical association found that technicians and clerks 
often changed doctors orders for thyroid function tests 
while they found that disturbing the researchers were 
surprised to find that in many cases especially when computers 
were involved the changes actually improved the tests 
the net effect of the changes to orders by nonphysicians was 
to reduce the number of inappropriately tested patients from 37 
percent to 25 percent the researchers said 
the study was conducted at an unidentified university medical 
center and a veterans administration hospital 
laboratory testing is becoming increasingly complex and its 
important to assure quality care throughout the whole system from 
the transmission of the order to the performance of the test 
said dr albert f finn who wrote the report with two other 
pathologists at the state university of new york at stony brook 
changing doctors orders could delay diagnosis as well as 
increase unnecessary testing the researchers said and such a 
practice is unacceptable under state laws and hospital bylaws 
in 54 percent of the 181 cases studied at the two hospitals 
clerical or lab staff changed one or more test orders the 
researchers found 
the university hospitals clerical staff who filed doctors 
requests using computerbased test agendas that list appropriate 
tests for specific diagnostic problems significantly improved 
the appropriateness of doctors test orders the study found 
but changes made at the va hospital where clerks used 
handwritten requisition slips tended to make the orders less 
appropriate the researchers said 
finn said in a telephone interview thursday that more study is 
needed to determine how much staff members participate in testing 
he and his colleagues recommended that nonmedical staff review 
laboratory test orders and bring improper requests to the attention 
of the physician as pharmacists do 
but dr edward t wong and dr janice nelson took issue with the 
suggestion in an accompanying editorial saying it would shift 
the burden for the error from the physician to the ward clerk or 
technologist charged with the review 
they recommended a method used at the university of southern 
california medical center at los angeles where wong is vice 
chairman of the pathology department 
doctors there use test request forms in which groups of 
appropriate tests are linked to specific diagnostic problems so the 
physician can avoid having to decipher and select from a list of 
test names encrypted in jargon they said 
wong said that with laboratory tests accounting for about 10 
percent to 15 percent of total medical costs it is important to 
ensure that tests meet doctors diagnostic needs

sandia national laboratories 
researchers have made a new superconducting film of material they 
say could have important ramifications to future generations of 
microelectronics and computers 
these films are really like hitting the jackpot and i think 
we did david s ginley supervisor of sandias semiconductor 
materials division said this week 
the thin thalliumbariumcopper oxide superconducting material 
loses all resistance to electricity at minus 285 degrees 
fahrenheit which ginley said is 13 degrees warmer than previously 
achieved in thin film superconductors 
superconductivity is the ability of some materials to conduct 
electricity without loss because of resistance improved 
superconductors could lead the way to powerful and compact 
computers highspeed floating trains and other advances 
scientists say 
the thalliumbariumcopper compound itself was developed by 
allen hermann chairman of the physics department at the university 
of arkansas and zhengzhi sheng a chemistry professor at the 
university 
the sandia researchers including james f kwak ronald p 
hellmer richard j baughman eugene l venturini and bruno 
morosin have been working on the new thalliumbased material for 
nine weeks ginley said 
the films made by the researchers are about seventenths of a 
micrometer thick and are deposited by layers on a substrate which 
is the material the film is put on 
we heat the metals with a controlled beam of electrons which 
vaporizes the metals onto the substrate ginley said 
the materials are then heated and cooled twice and thats what 
makes them superconducting ginley said 
the key to making the materials successfully is to carefully 
control the thallium content of the film during the heating and 
cooling process called anealing the researchers said 
hermann who spoke with the associated press in a telephone 
interview from fayetteville ark said he and sheng announced 
their discovery of the thalliumbased compound feb 15 
i think they did a terrific job hermann said of the sandia 
researchers im very excited about their work 
this means a number of things he said i see the 
potential for people improving the performance of electronic 
devices 
they can be used on onedimensional substrates like wire or 
fiber this is very exciting to think about now in the commercial 
realm of generators or motors or magnets hermann said 
traditional metal superconductors must be cooled to around minus 
460 degrees fahrenheit using expensive liquid helium but the new 
superconductors can be cooled with cheap liquid nitrogen

were found dead and four more were still missing this morning 
said wendy jacobs a shell spokeswoman fourtwo people were 
injured as windows shattered and doors and roofs were torn off 
throughout norco 
small stubborn fires continued to burn today at the refinery 
complex fueled by residual gasoline and oil in tangled lines and 
equipment but the towering blaze that sent black smoke over the 
area was out a specially trained crew of 25 plant workers poked 
through the wreckage today looking for the missing men said sarah 
colletti a plant spokeswoman 
the federal occupational safety and health administration and 
the environmental protection agency sent investigators to the 
refinery today to assist shell in determining the cause of the 
accident 
investigators hadnt determined the cause of the skyscraper 
inferno yet either and los angeles fire officials said they were 
calling on the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms to 
help because of the severity and scale of the blaze 
the request doesnt necessarily mean arson is suspected but 
rather that there is a need for the atfs technical expertise said 
fire department spokesman greg acevedo 
fire officials cited a flashover effect a phenomenon in 
which materials become superheated causing a firestorm in 
explaining the blazes rapid spread 
in nevada union and plant officials debated about safety at the 
pacific engineering building where ammonium perchlorate a key 
fuel component for the space shuttle and us military rockets was 
produced 
union officials said they had complained about safety at the 
plant but company officials denied there was a problem 
this plant is in my opinion one of the worst i have ever 
been into john molovich safety and heath technician with the 
international steelworkers union said in a letter following a 
september 1982 tour of the plant the letter was released thursday 
i cannot understand how this plant has not been blown off the 
face of the earth given the product it manufactures molovich 
wrote 
but fred gibson the company chairman responded it is a safe 
plant and i am stating there have been no fires there we had 
inspections from osha and we had no continuing problems with 
anything 
laury lewis general manager of the state industrial insurance 
system said his records indicate pacific engineering has always 
been a pretty good risk his records he said indicated no 
previous multiple injury problems or explosions 
pacific engineering was one of two plants in the united states 
that made ammonium perchlorate the other is kerrmcgee whose 
plant is just a mile away from the site of wednesdays destruction 
ammonium perchlorate production there was halted until the cause of 
the accident was determined and officials at rocket manufacturer 
morton thiokol inc said there could be an effect on the nations

eastern airlines today sued its pilots and 
machinists unions for 15 billion accusing them of trying to 
destroy the financially embattled carrier so they can buy it at a 
bargain basement price 
the lawsuit filed in us district court in miami by eastern and 
its parent texas air corp accuses the air line pilots 
association and the international association of machinists with 
racketeering extortion fraud and defamation 
the suit marked a new salvo in the airlines rancorous relations 
with its unions since it was bought by texas air management has 
pressed the machinists to accept deep wage cuts it deems necessary 
to return eastern to profitability 
the suits accusations against the unions include charges they 
conducted a public smearing of the carriers reputation staged 
illegal work slowdowns and tried to undermine worker loyalty 
eastern said in a press statement 
we cant provide any further comment on it said eastern 
spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
charles bryant president of the machinists local was returning 
to miami from a convention in atlanta and could not be reached for 
comment alpa spokesmen in washington also could not immediately be 
reached 
the easterntexas air complaint alleges the unions were 
attempting to obtain ownership and control of eastern through an 
extortionate scheme to smear the companys reputation 
if the unions failed in their attempt to drive down easterns 
price they were willing to ruin the company to maintain the 
excessive wages and bring back the high fares prevalent until 
deregulation changed the industry 10 years ago eastern contended 
in a news release 
named in the complaint were alpa and its eastern master 
executive council the iam and its district 100 and respective 
local union leaders including bryant and john j bavis jr of alpa 
eastern whose losses of some 900 million in the past 10 years 
include a 1816 million loss last year was bought by texas air in 
1986 for 676 million the miamibased carriers unions had tried 
to halt the sale making their own offer for eastern 
the federal aviation administration last month announced it was 
seeking 823000 in penalties from eastern for past safety 
violations and then began a planebyplane inspection of the 
carrier 
last year eastern paid 95 million in faa fines levied for 
safety violations 
on thursday the house public works and transportation committee 
approved a nonbinding resolution on thursday urging the us 
transportation department parent of the faa to widen the probe of 
eastern and texas air 
the resolution urges the department to look more closely at how 
texas air and eastern practices might affect the public and company 
employees 
it also seeks to have the department use its findings in 
deciding whether to allow texas air to make operating changes such 
as selling its bostonnew yorkwashington airshuttle service 
a federal judge has blocked eastern from selling the profitable 
shuttle service eastern is appealing the order 
the transportation department announced last month that it had 
begun investigating the management financial status and safety 
practices of texas air eastern and another texas air subsidiary 
continental airlines

vice president george bush said today 
he did not authorize statements by campaign aides calling attorney 
general edwin meese iii a campaign liability and said their views 
did not reflect his own 
while campaigning on a family farm near here bush was asked 
about a published report quoting campaign aides peter teeley and 
robert teeter as suggesting meese should resign 
bush in the past has declined to comment on whether the 
embattled attorney general should step aside claiming he did not 
want to prejudge the case 
the vice president said he was unaware of the comments of his 
two top aides i havent authorized anything now i have to get 
on the phone and find out what they said bush said 
the detroit news in a story published today said teeley 
bushs communications director and teeter a senior campaign 
adviser made the comments in interviews this week in washington 
meese is a liability teeley said 
all things considered you would rather not have that problem 
going on right now teeter said no one is arguing that it is a 
plus to have that situation going on over there 
meese is being investigated by independent counsel james mckay 
in connection with a government contract with the new york 
citybased wedtech corp questions also have been raised about his 
role in a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline project a justice 
department lease and involvement in department policy on 
telecommunications industry issues at a time when he owned regional 
bell stock meese has denied any wrongdoing 
what a guy like meese does is take away the opportunity to 
discuss the issues that you really want to discuss teeley said 
i mean you are consistently asked about meeses problems how 
you deal with it how you stand one thing or another and that 
just totally diverts attention from the message that you are trying 
to get across 
teeley said he doesnt know if bush has talked to president 
reagan about meese

emergency crews searching the smoldering 
wreckage of a refinery discovered two bodies today raising the 
death toll to three and leaving four men missing in the blast that 
shattered plate glass windows 30 miles away 
wendy jacobs a shell spokeswoman said the two were among six 
employees who had been missing since the explosion 
police today patrolled virtually windowless norco to protect the 
towns bank furniture store and other businesses the local coop 
lost most of a wall facing the plant when the devastating explosion 
cut loose 
at least three shell oil co employees died and 42 other people 
were injured in the blast in a catalytic cracker thursday morning 
this morning small stubborn fires continued to burn fueled by 
residual gasoline and oil in tangled lines and equipment but the 
towering blaze that sent up clouds of black smoke had died out 
twentyfive members of the plant emergency crew went into the 
maze of hot twisted metal searching for the missing said plant 
spokeswoman sarah colletti tight security prevented anyone else 
from entering the plant 
the federal occupational safety and health administration and 
the environmental protection agency sent investigators to the 
refinery today to assist shell in trying to determine what caused 
the explosion 
it went boom and then boom again said adam mashia 
65 who lives less than a mile from the plant it knocked me to 
the floor and as i was getting up it knocked me down again 
the force of the explosion broke windows in new orleanss garden 
district 30 miles down the mississippi river 
people in slidell 45 miles distant said they also felt the 
blast the fire that broke out in the refinery forced the 
evacuation of about 2500 residents until it was brought under 
control about 5 hours later 
gasoline futures prices went up because of the damage to the 
plant which will create a squeeze on gasoline supplies in the gulf 
coast according to greg dreis an analyst at merrill lynch energy 
futures 
authorities waited for the plants remains to cool down today 
before searching for the missing men also shell employees 
fred foster manager of shells norco complex said shell has 
established a claims center for victims 
he also said a team of company investigators joined by state 
and federal authorities would begin looking for the cause of the 
blast once the plant cooled down 
alan migliore who lives about three blocks from the refinery 
complex said i was sleeping in the kitchen and it knocked me to 
the floor from there i looked up and could see that the whole 
area to the shell was on fire it blew both of the front doors 
in and the deadbolts took the frames out 
damage at the refinery complex alone was expected to run into 
the millions of dollars said shell spokesman phil schwin the 
accident ruptured the catalytic cracker which converts crude oil 
to gasoline and seriously damaged control rooms and other 
facilities 
residents of this town on the heavily industrialized 75mile 
petrochemical corridor said they are fed up over recurring 
emergencies that have forced them to evacuate their homes eight 
times in 12 years 
people were literally frightened out of their minds said 
new orleans attorney jt hill who filed a 25 billion lawsuit 
within hours of the explosion 
i didnt know what happened said another resident paul 
dauzat 55 i went to look out the window and my wife said why 
are you looking out the window the door is off 
damage was sustained on both sides of the milewide mississippi 
river and shell oil said people needing repair materials could 
charge them to the companys account at lumber yards on the rivers 
east and west banks 
in baton rouge gov buddy roemer said he didnt plan to ask for 
federal disaster assistance because of shells willingness to 
accept responsibility for damages 
just inside the gates of the shell complex was a sign with the 
familiar shell logo saying complex safe days 616 as the fire 
continued workers took the sign down

the three strode children have insisted on preaching outside the 
school while school officials say they must enter the building and 
go to class if theyre on the grounds 
david strode a machinist has been a street preacher since 1981 
its not the preaching the issue is the disruptive noise the 
screaming gorst said its stressful to our teachers and its 
stressful to our students 
from 730 to 745 am pepper stood quietly with matthew behind 
the schools rear entrance as he and duffey alternately shouted 
bible verses duffey stood in the road outside the school gate 100 
yards away 
youre in violation of school rules by being out here gorst 
told matthew and pepper after two more warnings gorst approached 
robin strodes car parked near the gate matthew and pepper 
followed 
come in the office please with your children i think you 
realize your children are in violation of school rules gorst 
said 
as robin strode left the school with matthew and pepper after 
meeting with gorst she said i hope the lord takes every last 
one of them and does something to them they aint nothing but a 
bunch of hypocrites 
the children are honor roll students and their mother has been 
picking up their homework during their suspensions if theyre 
suspended again matthew pepper and duffey may not be promoted to

vice president george bush said today 
that efforts to hurt him politically with the irancontra affair 
were tested and tried in the primary and failed 
im not worried at all bush said im not vulnerable 
bush has been dogged by questions about his role in the 
armsforhostages affair throughout his candidacy although 
republican primary voters apparently cared little about the issue 
his democratic opponents have indicated they will try to make 
irancontra an issue in the fall campaign 
im not worried its been tested and tried in the primary 
bush said 
bush also shook off the published comments of two top aides 
quoted as saying embattled attorney general edwin meese iii was a 
liability to bushs republican presidential campaign 
i havent authorized anything now i have to get on the phone 
and find out what they said bush said 
on thursday bush called for retaining federal supports on sugar 
and other crops even though he favors eventual elimination of farm 
subsidies 
the vice president is ending a threeday swing through the west 
with campaign stops today here and in montana he was to visit a 
local family farm and inspect an irrigation system before flying to 
billings mont for a rally 
agriculture issues have been a main focus of his idaho visit 
under a bush administration the sugar program would 
continue even though i would try very hard to expand markets abroad 
by breaking down barriers to american products bush said 
asked by reporters on thursday in boise if he advocates a 
lifting of sugar import quotas important in this region where 
sugar beets are a major crop bush said he would not despite 
reagan advocacy of a global easing of farm subsidies 
i know every administration gives lip service to eliminating 
the sugar program and other programs but its not going to happen 
unilaterally believe me he said 
at last years sevennation economic summit in venice president 
reagan called upon us trading partners to end all agricultural 
trade subsidies including quotas by the year 2000 
reducing such trade barriers is currently on the agenda in a new 
round of global trade talks under way in geneva 
bush who has the republican presidential nomination in the bag 
but is continuing to campaign anyway with an eye on the fall 
election said id have a prowestern policy 
theres room for a lot of economic growth and energy growth in 
the west he said 
meanwhile bush said reagan is withholding his formal 
endorsement of his candidacy so it can be done with a degree of 
fanfare 
were waiting for a dramatic moment to capture the applause of 
the waiting political crowds bush said in an interview with the 
local cbs affiliate in boise 
theres no question where ronald reagans sentiments lie he 
told me this as recently as two days ago were waiting to do it so 
it has a little flair to it 
to date the white house has been mum on when the endorsement 
will come although presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater has 
indicated it will be soon 
theres a lot of thinking going on on it what would be best 
but the issue is not in doubt bush said i dont think theres 
a person in the united states democrat or republican who wonders 
who president reagan is going to support for president 
on another subject bush said that he would not pay money for 
the release of hostages under any circumstances 
responding to a question centering on news reports of possible 
french payments to seek the release of recently released french 
hostages bush said 
no because i just think that will make others be taken 
hostage 
on the sale of us arms to seek the release of us hostages 
held in lebanon bush conceded to the degree that it turned out 
to be arms for hostages it was diametrically opposed to us 
policy our policy is not to do that 
mistakes were made yes mistakes were made but the genesis 
the creation of that was not arms for hostages 
bush said he expected democrats to use the irancontra affair 
against him as an issue because theyre devoid of other national 
issues 
the vice president was asked by local reporters if sen james 
mcclure ridaho a longtime friend was under consideration as a 
possible running made 
bush who has been bombarded with similar questions about other 
regional favorites wherever he goes praised mcclure highly but 
once again stressed he has not yet begun the selection process 
preferring to wait until after the democrats pick their full team 
at their convention in july

the plos executive committee gave strong 
indications that it will seek to intensify the uprising in the 
israelioccupied territories following israels raid on arab 
guerrillas in lebanon 
the 15member committee ended six days of closeddoor talks 
thursday night its first session since palestine liberation 
organization chairman yasser arafat met syrian president hafez 
assad in damascus on april 25 
the arafathassad meeting ended a 5yearold feud 
the committee which rarely announces in detail what decisions 
it reaches vowed in a communique issued late thursday to 
redouble revolutionary effort by all ways and means and in all 
fields 
it did not elaborate but it was widely interpreted as meaning 
an intensification of the 5monthold uprising in the west bank and 
gaza strip against 20 years of israeli occupation 
it was also seen as an indication that the plo plans to step up 
guerrilla attacks on israel 
an israeli force pushed into south lebanon on monday in a 
twoday raid against palestinian guerrillas and their moslem allies 
who have carried out several raids into israel in recent weeks 
the israelis reported killing 40 proiranian shiite moslem 
militiamen during the sweep three israeli soldiers also died 
the communique said the plo leadership has taken all necessary 
measures to maintain the uprising in the occupied territories and 
to enhance the steadfastness of our people under occupation 
arafats reconciliation with assad in the wake of the april 16 
assassination of plo military commander khalil wazir believed to 
be the plos main strategist in the israeli uprising could be a 
plus for the plo 
the reconciliation would strengthen the plos guerrilla campaign 
against the israelis the syrians control north and east lebanon 
where they have about 25000 troops and could provide valuable 
logistical assistance for crossborder raids

bush on thursday was asked about the release of three french 
hostages and said he would never agree to payments to secure the 
release of americans in captivity 
jackson dukakis democratic rival was chafing at what he 
called the premature coronation of dukakis jackson stepped up 
his criticism of party delegateselection rules on thursday but 
dukakis virtually ignored him training his fire instead on bush 
jackson was campaigning today in california whose primary on 
june 7 will be the biggest and last of the season dukakis was 
home in boston with no campaign events scheduled for the next few 
days 
bush was hustling through a series of stops today in idaho 
montana and nebraska all three states have primaries in the next 
month but as bush already has a numerical lock on the republican 
nomination aides say he is aiming to build western backing for the 
general election 
the vice presidents comments about hostages came amid reports 
that france had arranged thursdays release of three french 
hostages by agreeing to pay the outstanding balance on a loan 
originally totaling 1 billion made by the late shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi of iran france has denied paying a ransom for the trios 
release 
bush said he would never agree to such an arrangement because 
i just think that will make others be taken hostage 
the vice presidents role in the reagan administrations 
armsforhostages deal with iran has been questioned by republican 
and democratic opponents alike to the degree that it turned out 
to be arms for hostages it was diametrically opposed to us 
policy bush said thursday of the deal 
he conceded that the democrats are making the republican 
armsforhostages plan a campaign issue but claimed they are 
devoid of other national issues 
bushs campaign was engaged in damage control after the vice 
presidents comments a day earlier that he sometimes refrains from 
speaking up at cabinet meetings because he is concerned about 
leaks and because he doesnt want president reagan to be forced to 
choose between him and other officials 
dukakis campaigning in west virginia on thursday seized on 
that saying that in massachusetts he has a lively cabinet and 
sometimes they get loud and contentious 
thats the way you get good give and take the governor 
said i hope ill have a vice president who speaks up and speaks 
out 
attempting to blunt the criticism bush spokesman stephen hart 
said bushs comments about keeping quiet at cabinet meetings didnt 
mean bush avoids giving the president his opinions hart said bush 
has ample opportunity to do that privately 
he reserves his advice for the president the spokesman said 
thursday as bush spent a day focusing on education issues 
the vice president visited james a garfield high school in 
predominantly hispanic east los angeles he sat in on a calculus 
class taught by jaime escalante whose teaching of advanced math to 
disadvantaged students is the subject of a movie stand and 
deliver 
bush said if he is elected there will be a changing of 
priorities to some degree to reflect more emphasis on education 
however he cautioned there has to be a limitation to what the 
federal government can do 
that stance too drew a dig from dukakis who discounted bushs 
pledge to be an education president the white house he said 
must always be a supporter of education not just during 
election years 
jackson for the second day in a row attacked the democratic 
delegateselection process saying dukakis big lead in the 
delegate race was inflated by the latest ap delegate count 
dukakis has 1500 to jacksons 927 
campaigning in kearney neb jackson said he did not intend to 
challenge party rules formally but that he believed the support of 
super delegates should be roughly in line with the popular vote 
in contests to date super delegates have a voice at the democratic 
national convention by virtue of their elective or party offices 
jackson has won 28 percent of the votes in primaries so far but 
is publicly supported by just 46 super delegates dukakis who has 
won 37 percent of the primary votes is supported by 166 super 
delegates 
well be making appeals for fairness and we certainly hope 
people will respond jackson said what the people are saying 
must not be covered up by all the talk of the coronation and 
the race is over the race is on 
asked about jacksons complaints dukakis campaign spokesman 
mark gearan said only these rules have been in place for some 
time

a legal quirk may still allow late taxpayers 
to get their forms postmarked before the april 15 filing deadline 
but officials caution against relying on the technicality to avoid 
paying penalties 
the backdated postmarks are available because of a special 
postal service program for stamp collectors who want to get 
examples of stamps postmarked on the first day they are issued 
theoretically the remaining taxpayers who havent filed could 
also use the system to dodge the fact that they missed the deadline 
last month linns stamp news a newspaper for collectors suggests 
in its may 9 editions 
but officials of the postal service and internal revenue service 
said such an action would be questionable 
only about 3 million tax returns of the nearly 100 million due 
have yet to be filed the irs estimates and most of them are from 
americans overseas who still have time to file 
the backdated postmark service is designed to help collectors 
who cannot travel from city to city to be present for first day of 
issue ceremonies for each new postage stamp 
new stamps are sold only in the city of issue on the first day 
going on sale elsewhere the next day 
with the special service collectors can go to post offices in 
their home towns and buy the stamps place them on envelopes and 
mail the envelopes in bulk to the firstday post office for special 
cancellations 
this service is usually offered for about a month after a stamp 
is issued to give collectors time to take advantage of it and to 
ease first day pressure on the issuing post office 
for the new e stamps the time has been extended to may 21 
since they were released on rather short notice march 22 in 
anticipation of the new postage rates that took effect april 3 
thus in theory at least a collector could put the new e 
stamps on an envelope containing tax forms send it to washington 
for the first day cancellation and it would then be delivered with 
the date march 22 on the envelope linns reports 
technically then the taxpayer could still send in the forms 
on time under court decisions that have held a postmark is 
evidence of filing 
but irs and postal service raised questions 
the firstdayofissue cancellations look different and are 
treated differently from regular date cancellations affixed to 
mail said dick rustin manager of the postal services stamp 
information branch 
regular cancellations do confirm the date something was mailed 
he said but for those which state first day of issue he 
said we would not verify that the mail entered the system on 
that day 
tax forms arriving a month late with a march 22 cancellation 
might also raise questions at the irs said spokeswoman johnell 
hunter she said the tax agency might check to see if the person 
sending in the form had a history of being late

on the sidelines of its middle east diplomacy 
the united states is trying to mediate between the leaders of syria 
and lebanon who havent been on speaking terms for more than a year 
the us diplomatic shuttle was begun nearly five months ago by 
april glaspie the us ambassadordesignate to iraq reagan 
administration officials said glaspie is focusing on attempts to 
negotiate a more equitable powersharing agreement between 
lebanons christians and moslems 
her mission is particularly urgent in the face of a sept 23 
constitutional deadline for presidential elections in lebanon the 
officials said no date has been set for the balloting 
syria which controls parts of lebanon with more than 30000 
troops has proposed a formula granting increased power to 
lebanons moslem majority the christians led by president amin 
gemayel have so far rejected the change according to lebanese 
christian groups in washington 
ms glaspie who has good ties with the syrian leadership from 
her days as a political officer in the us embassy in damascus 
also has enlisted the help of the vatican and the french government 
to influence the christians one us official said 
like other state department officials he spoke on condition of 
anonymity so as not to jeopardize ms glaspies diplomatic effort 
but the united states does not appear to have much hope of 
success 
there are very difficult issues involved so that its going to 
continue to take effort but were committed to seeing what we can 
do state department spokesman charles redman said this week 
another official said that as time for negotiations runs out 
ms glaspie is focusing on getting agreement from both sides to set 
an election date and to curb violence by their forces 
the united states is concerned that if elections are not held 
the ensuing power vacuum would plunge the country into anarchy and 
leave it in the hands of the dozens of militias which virtually run 
it now he said 
and of course theres the question of nurturing syrian good 
will the official added 
syria is moscows main ally in the middle east and a radical in 
the arab camp following a thaw in relations with washington last 
fall syrian president hafez assad promised to help obtain freedom 
for american hostages believed held in syrianrun sections of 
beirut 
under an unwritten 1943 agreement the presidency in lebanon is 
reserved for a christian and the posts of prime minister and 
parliament speaker for moslems this year however some leading 
moslems have begun laying claim to the presidency too 
gemayel was elected in 1982 when his brother was assassinated 
nine days before he was due to take office he is not running for 
another term and the only candidate who has officially declared is 
dany chamoun a former christian militia leader 
the change in presidents is seen by the reagan administration as 
a good opportunity to seek political reform the need to stem the 
factional violence is particularly urgent for the united states in 
view of the collapse of the countrys economy which has all but 
wiped out its middle class 
the lebanese pound once the mideasts most stable currency has 
nosedived to an alltime low of 700 to the dollar until 1985 it 
was 25 to the dollar 
but a lebanese christian official suggested there is more to the 
us and syrian efforts than just a desire for calm in lebanon 
lebanon is not the main thrust said robert farah executive 
director of the lebanese information and research center in 
washington which represents a coalition of christian forces 
farah said the united states is hoping it can parlay its help 
with syrias lebanese problem into syrian support for us efforts 
to start israeliarab peace talks syria has so far rejected the 
plan 
the united states also is hoping syria can use its influence 
with the palestine liberation organization to quell a fivemonth 
uprising by palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip against 
israels occupation the us official said 
syria hopes better relations with the united states may ease 
some of its economic problems and ensure its role in future us 
diplomacy

a federal judge today rejected a lawsuit filed by 
gov michael dukakis aimed at preventing massachusetts national 
guard troops from training in central america 
us district judge robert keeton in a lengthy opinion said 
federal authorities have the power to give orders to national guard 
troops even when a governor objects 
keeton explicitly upheld the constitutionality of the montgomery 
amendment a 1986 act of congress that strips governors of the 
power to decline such assignments unless their states are facing an 
emergency that requires the guard 
lawyers for the justice department had argued that the 
constitution gives congress final authority over the nations 
entire military apparatus 
attorneys for dukakis had claimed that governors reserve 
authority over training the militia 
at issue in the case was the legality of a pentagon order 
directing 13 public information officers to take part in training 
in panama and honduras for two weeks in late may and early june 
dukakis a democratic presidential candidate who has been a 
vocal critic of the reagan administrations central american 
policy had opposed the directive 
minnesota gov rudy perpich joined by massachusetts and nine 
other states challenged the law last year in us district court 
in st paul and lost that case is now on appeal

edwin meese iii is quietly making plans to 
remain as attorney general at least until september 
despite widespread speculation that the heat generated by 
meeses legal problems will soon drive him from his post there is 
in his latest flap a largely overlooked clue from meese himself 
about his determination to stay on 
amid a stream of public disclosures about his assorted legal 
problems meese last month privately and quickly accepted an 
invitation to make an official visit to japan as attorney general 
aug 29sept 1 even though the trip itself has engendered 
controversy he gives every indication of planning to go 
at mel krupins restaurant frequented by lawyers and lobbyists 
political operatives and pundits krupin says they talk about 
meese but they dont make any comments about the propriety of 
meeses actions nobody knows if hes going to stay or go they 
just talk about how long hell stay 
independent counsel james mckay is not expected to indict meese 
in any of the handful of cases he has investigated but mckays 
public report is expected late this month 
mckay is expected to excoriate meese for tolerating the 
appearance of conflicts of interest even where they may not in fact 
exist actions creating such appearances are forbidden by 
presidential order 
mckay then is likely to refer his evidence to justice department 
internal ethics officers for recommendations on whether 
administrative discipline by president reagan is required 
most observers predict one of two outcomes either meese will 
seize the lack of an indictment as vindication and quickly step 
down or mckays move will allow him to continue for a decent 
interval before departing voluntarily 
a less widely held view is that meese will not leave unless 
reagan forces him out 
this debate has emerged from months of seemingly nonstop meese 
revelations 
on jan 29 the los angeles times disclosed a 1986 memo from his 
confidant e robert wallach to meese that to some seemed to 
suggest illegal bribes to israeli officials to clear the way for an 
oil pipeline 
on feb 11 meeses former white house colleague lyn nofziger 
was convicted of lobbying for wedtech a reminder that meese 
remains under investigation for his role on behalf of that bronx 
ny defense contractor 
unseen by the public until this week an invitation for meese 
arrived march 15 from japanese justice minister yukio hayashida to 
visit japan beginning aug 29 meeses official visit would 
coincide with a private conference on usjapanese legal issues 
running through sept 1 
a day after the invitation arrived independent counsel lawrence 
walsh returned an indictment in the irancontra case although 
meese was not among walshs targets the charges were a reminder of 
meeses oftcriticized role in investigating that scandal 
sometime before the end of march mckay privately told meeses 
attorneys he did not have enough evidence for indictments in the 
pipeline case or in another matter in which meese approved a major 
reversal of justice department telephone antitrust policy while 
owning stock in regional telephone companies that could benefit 
from the reversal 
on march 29 deputy attorney general arnold burns and assistant 
attorney william weld head of the criminal division quit on short 
notice they made it clear that they doubted meese could run the 
department effectively and weld told meese that if he were the 
independent counsel he would indict the attorney general 
on april 1 mckay publicly announced his interim decision about 
the pipeline and telephone cases but added that his grand jury had 
other matters to investigate 
on april 4 meese privately wrote hayashida he was most 
pleased to accept your gracious invitation to visit japan at the 
end of this summer justice department political appointees this 
week described this response as extraordinarily quick compared with 
other matters they say have languished in meeses office for months 
and even years such as whether to challenge two major supreme 
court rulings on criminal law 
on april 13 the associated press reported that a wealthy 
washington real estate family arranged to pay a 40000 annual 
salary to meeses wife ursula then won renewal of a 50 million 
lease to provide offices for the justice department and quickly 
sold the building for a 28 million profit mckay is investigating 
the matter 
on april 20 burns and weld met reagan and told him facetoface 
of their concerns the president promptly summoned meese heard his 
side and as reagan has always done before reaffirmed support 
for his longtime friend 
on april 21 in his first mention of leaving meese told usa 
today if an attorney general was indicted i think that would be 
a basis for stepping aside but he added i dont know of any 
factor right now that would cause me to resign 
on april 26 the cosponsor of the japan conference mailed 
30000 copies of a letter from meese to lawyers and businessmen 
asking them to pay more than 3000 apiece to join him at the japan 
conference 
on may 3 meeses solicitation letter and japan trip plans were 
disclosed in news reports the office of government ethics opened 
an investigation of the arrangements 
on may 4 william barraclough chief executive of the private 
group planning the japan conference said there are no 
indications whatever that ed meese is going to back out

a cook county judge today ruled that a special 
mayoral election should be held in 1989 so that voters can pick a 
successor to the late mayor harold washington 
circuit judge eugene wachowski issued the ruling after listening 
to arguments by a half dozen attorneys representing two groups that 
had filed opposing lawsuits over the issue 
alderman timothy evans considered a potential candidate and an 
opponent of interim mayor eugene sawyer called the ruling a 
marvelous marvelous victory for the citizens of chicago 
a spokesman for a group that favored allowing sawyer to complete 
washingtons term which would have ended in 1991 said todays 
ruling would be appealed 
wachowski said it was clearly up to the city board of elections 
whether to call a special election in 1989 as it in fact did 
earlier this week 
loud cheers and applause erupted as wachowski announced his 
decision and he had to call for order 
russ stewart representing a group called united citizens of 
chicago and illinois had argued against holding a special 
election saying that sawyer was rightfully elected by the city 
council in december 
as a result stewart told the judge that sawyer should be 
allowed to serve until the next regularly scheduled election in 
1991 
we do not believe there has been any disruption in government 
from having the vacancy caused by the death of harold washington 
and the filling of that vacancy by mr sawyer stewart said 
but tom johnson an attorney for a group called the coalition to 
let the people decide in 1989 contended that state law clearly 
says a special election must be held if more than 28 months remain 
in the unexpired term of a vacant municipal office 
the question is whether the voters the people in the 
neighborhoods will have a chance to participate in deciding who 
will govern the city of chicago for the remainder of washingtons 
48month term johnson told the judge 
washington died nov 25 of a heart attack and sawyer was elected 
by the city council a week later hundreds of washington and evans 
supporters demonstrated against what they said were backroom 
deals that unfairly left the citizens out of deciding who should 
be mayor 
evans declined to comment on whether he would run in the special 
election saying youll have to tune in to see 
kenneth hurst president of the united citizens group and a 
former gop candidate for mayor said he would appeal the decision 
he described the group as a nonpartisan watchdog organization 
seeking fair government

attorneys for two journalists who accuse us and 
contra officials of running an illegal drug and arms smuggling ring 
said today their case is being thwarted by federal officials trying 
to protect vice president george bush 
the comments came during a hearing on the 24 million damage 
suit that was filed in federal court here by journalists tony 
avirgan and martha honey they are represented by the christic 
institute a liberal policy group 
avirgan was injured in a may 1984 bombing which the two blame on 
a group that includes richard v secord and albert hakim two 
businessmen who were charged with conspiracy and theft in the 
irancontra case 
the lawsuit does not cite any us government officials among 
its 29 defendants central to the lawsuit is the claim that the 
defendants conspired to traffic in drugs and plot assassinations in 
central america and elsewhere the defendants have denied the 
charges 
the lawsuit filed in may 1986 several months before the 
irancontra affair was exposed publicly names some of the people 
in the private network that lt col oliver l north formed to help 
the nicaraguan contras who oppose nicaraguas leftist government 
the allegations in the civil lawsuit set for trial june 26 in 
federal court in miami are broader than the issues raised by 
lawrence walsh the independent counsel in the irancontra case 
in the hearing today before us district judge james king 
christic attorney daniel sheehan said part of their case involved 
bushs directorship of the central intelligence agency in 1976 when 
he allegedly allowed covert operations to go off the books to 
prevent them from being ended by the incoming administration of 
president jimmy carter 
during a recess sheehan told the associated press that some of 
the defendants in the case were running the covert operations for 
george bush 
sheehan said the case was being held up to protect bush who is 
virtually certain to be the republican nominee for president this 
year 
attorneys for some of the defendants were to speak later in the 
day 
the honeyavirgan lawsuit claims that a secret team headed 
by former cia official theodore shackley worked over two decades to

mayor 
caliguiri serving his third term as mayor of this city of 
400000 suffered from cardiac amyloidosis which deposits

he worked for 15 years in the city parks department eventually as 
a director

mostlivable city 
caliguiri became aware he was ill in march 1987 when he became 
dizzy while playing golf however he said nothing publicly until 
oct 2 when the pittsburgh press confronted him with medical 
evidence 
if a conflict should ever arise between my public 
responsibilities and my personal health i will be the first to 
know it and the first to act on it he said this city is too 
important to me i have dedicated my life to it to do 
otherwise 
two weeks later mayor louis j tullio of erie disclosed he also 
suffered from amyloidosis which usually is found only in men of

active mourning of the same level as the massacre on ouvea and 
urged work stoppages and barricades to be set up in the streets 
french police said the bodies of three more kidnappers were 
found on the island of ouvea they also said the presumed chief of 
the captors alphonse dianou died of wounds inflicted during 
thursdays assault

assault team also died five people were injured 
this french pacific territory appeared calm friday after troops 
stormed the secluded cave on ouvea and freed the hostages 
bernard pons frances minister for overseas territories said 
the 7000 army and gendarmerie personnel on new caledonia were 
placed on a state of absolute alert 
pons said terrorists will find themselves in front of 
entirely determined men he did not elaborate 
the rescue team pelted the cave with tear gas canisters during 
the nearly sevenhour battle on ouvea which is in the loyalty 
island group the hostages freed themselves from their manacles 
with a key that had been smuggled in by a hostage who was being 
used as a gobetween with french authorties 
melanesians make up 36 percent of the territorys 145000 
people while european settlers comprise about 43 percent the rest 
are asian or polynesian 
the melanesian front is seeking independence from france which 
has ruled new caledonia since 1853

melanesians protesting the first phase of the french presidential 
elections on april 24 a group of separatists stormed a police 
station killed four gendarmes and seized several others

to the main separatist organization as a terrorist group pons 
has asked that it be outlawed a position chirac supports 
in an interview published friday in several french newspapers

possible to build a fraternal caledonia where no one feels 
excluded 
chirac and socialist president francois mitterrand are vying for 
the presidency in elections on sunday and their positions on new 
caledonia differ 
chirac takes a hard line while mitterrand favors mediation 
between the european settlers and the native melanesians who have 
become a minority in their own land since france colonized it in 
1853

presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
friday it is admirable and courageous of his old boss vice 
president george bush to refrain from making recommendations to 
president reagan during cabinet meetings 
fitzwater who was bushs press secretary before becoming the 
chief white house spokesman last year was asked about statements 
the vice president made during a presidential campaign swing 
through western states 
bush speaking to reporters during a campaign stop in sacramento 
on wednesday said kiss and tell books about the administration 
are partly to blame for his reluctance to speak up more in meetings 
the vice president also said i hold back speaking in meetings 
because i dont want the president to have to be choosing between 
his vice president and the other members of the cabinet 
fitzwater said the vice president has taken that position 
since day one that he is a private adviser to the president he 
reserves his recommendations and confidence for the president and 
often doesnt voice his feelings in meetings for that very reason 
that they will be leaked or go to the press or that various people 
will try to use his positions to take sides to the president 
he has defined an appropriate position for the vice president 
that i find admirable and courageous in view of the heavy pressures 
that are continually put on him to talk fitzwater said he has 
for the first time in history defined the vice presidency in a way 
that is meaningful to the president and has made it the 
confidential adviser that i think is very important and i suspect 
future vice presidents will want to follow that mold 
fitzwater also said that the president will soon endorse bush 
who has amassed more than the number of delegates needed for the 
republican presidential nomination at an appropriate ceremony 
and function probably with very high visibility 
he said the white house was not ready to announce when this will 
be the president will speak at a fundraising dinner for 
republican congressional candidates on wednesday fitzwater said 
bush was expected to attend

president najib of afghanistan said 
friday his army would deal a heavy and severe blow to moslem 
guerrillas if they keep fighting his government but said his offer 
of a political role for the guerrillas stands 
the usbacked guerrillas whose headquarters are in pakistan 
have refused to participate in any government headed by najib in a 
statement issued friday in new delhi they attacked indias 
misconceived policy of taking the side of the criminal regime 
of kabul 
the afghan president met prime minister rajiv gandhi and several 
top government officials during his threeday stay in new delhi and 
then held a press conference 
najib said india and afghanistan whose mutual antagonist is 
pakistan achieved new levels of cooperation during his visit 
the indian government announced that india has agreed to supply 
afghanistan with 2000 tons of tea over a fouryear period joint 
ventures and an indian role in reconstruction projects were also 
discussed but no details were given 
najib also told reporters he had rejected a petition by foreign 
journalists to free an italian journalist and a french photographer 
jailed in afghanistan on espionage charges 
when asked about the fate of the two journalists najib former 
head of afghanistans kbgstyle secret police said both 
participated in the war conflicts and illegally entered 
afghanistan they resorted to subversive activities 
fausto biloslavo an italian who worked for the small albatross 
news agency was captured in july 1987 convicted in march of 
spying and sentenced to seven years in prison 
alain guillo a french freelancer who often worked for the 
sygma photo agency was captured in march 1987 convicted jan 4 of 
spying and sentenced to 10 years in prison 
both men were captured after entering the country with the 
guerrillas who have been fighting nearly 10 years to oust najibs

socialist government against attacks by islamic guerrillas the 
soviet withdrawal is scheduled to begin may 15 under an agreement

suicide by refusing to talk with his government 
he reiterated that the deposed afghan king zahir shah was free 
to return home to participate in politics 
zahir shah was overthrown in 1973 by a cousin who in turn was 
assassinated in 1978 afghan refugees and some western officials 
have suggested that zahir shahs return from his exile in rome 
might pave the way for a transition of government 
an indian official speaking after najibs news conference said 
india had played an informal role in discussing the afghan problems 
with the deposed king as well as with the united states the 
soviet union and pakistan the official spoke on condition of

medicares fortunes have improved and its 
trust fund now is not likely to run out of cash until the year 
2005 while the social security old age fund should be solvent 
until the middle of the 21st century the systems trustees told 
congress on friday 
the 2005 date is three years later than was forecast a year ago 
the trustees including three reagan cabinet members said 
social securitys old age fund also had achieved robust gains and 
predicted it will have enough funds to cover expenditures for 
about 60 years into the future 
the board said medicares trust fund grew by nearly 14 billion 
in calendar 1987 and finished the year with reserves of 537 
billion 
assuming moderate economic conditions the hospital insurance 
reserves were forecast to grow to nearly 153 billion over the next 
decade before dwindling to nothing in the year 2005 
the trustees urged congress to take early remedial measures to 
bring future medicare costs and finance into balance and to 
avoid the need for later potentially precipitous changes 
they said the shortfall could be covered by a 14 percent cut in 
benefits a 16 percent increase in the medicare tax or a 
combination of both 
in the early 1980s the trustees warned medicares trust fund 
would go bankrupt in the 1990s its financial picture has improved 
partly as a result of federal constraints on hospital payments 
the medicare program provides hospital insurance for 28 million 
americans 65 or older and 3 million disabled workers under 65 the 
program took in 641 billion in payroll taxes and other income in 
1987 and paid out 503 billion 
the social security old age fund on the verge of bankruptcy 
just a few years ago experienced even more robust growth it grew 
by 23 billion in 1987 reflecting the continuing growth in the 
economy the trustees said and finished the year with 621 
billion in reserves 
the old age program had income of 2107 billion and 
disbursements of 1877 billion in 1987 
the disability fund took in 203 billion but paid out 214 
billion and finished 1987 with 67 billion in reserve 
the old age and disability programs pay benefits to 38 million 
retirees and disabled workers 
the trustees said the 11 billion drop in the disability 
reserve was due to a growing number of people awarded disability 
benefits 
the trustees said they expected the number of aids victims 
drawing disability to grow rapidly through 1991 
but so far they said due to the extremely high mortality 
rates the total number of disabled workers currently receiving 
benefits has not increased greatly as a result of aids 
the combined old age and disability funds now equal to about 
three months benefit payments are expected to bulge rapidly over 
the next 27 years peaking at more than 12 trillion 2 trillion 
in todays dollars in 2015 that would be enough to pay benefits 
for more than five years 
the old age and disability funds are expected to grow by 40 
billion this year 46 billion in 1989 and 75 billion in 1992 
the trustees said the next social security advisory council 
should examine what the proper level of fund accumulation should 
be some politicians including rep jack kemp rny have 
called for lowering the payroll tax instead of building up a huge 
reserve 
otis r bowen the secretary of health and human services said 
those reserves will be needed to meet the financial obligations 
of the program in the next century when the young workers of today 
become eligibile for social security 
the plan is to dig into that reserve after 2015 to help pay 
retirement for the socalled baby boom generation until the funds 
are exhausted in 2048 the trustees said 
then the system would need to raise taxes or lower benefits to 
stay on an even keel the actuarial deficit over 75 years is just 
058 percent of taxable payroll the equivalent of a 029 percent 
increase in the payroll tax on workers and employers 
in 1960 there were 51 workers paying taxes for each 
beneficiary today there are 34 workers per beneficiary the 
trustees said the ratio will fall gradually to 3to1 by the year 
2010 and then 2to1 by the year 2030 
they predicted a 38 percent benefit increase next january with 
increases of 4 percentplus over the next five years 
they also forecast that the maximum amount of wages subject to 
the social security and medicare tax now 45000 will rise to 
46500 in 1989 48600 in 1990 and 57000 in 1993 the tax 
climbs from 751 percent to 765 percent in 1990 
the trustees also forecast scenarios under optimistic and 
pessimistic economic and demographic conditions their estimate of 
moderate conditions however is the one usually relied on by 
congress 
this middlerange forecast assumes longrange growth of 14 
percent a year in real wages inflation of 4 percent interest 
rates of 6 percent and unemployment at 6 percent 
the trustees report to congress was five weeks overdue 
james a baker iii the secretary of the treasury is the 
managing trustee the others are bowen secretary of labor ann 
mclaughlin and two from the private sector mary falvey fuller and 
suzanne denbo jaffe

researchers at the johns hopkins hospital have 
used a sophisticated computer program to enhance images of a 
2500yearold mummy in three dimensions said a radiology 
professor 
dr elliot fishman a johns hopkins school of medicine associate 
professor of radiology and his staff used the process thursday to 
take nearly 500 crosssectional images of the mummy using a modern 
ct scanner a device that takes thin crosssectional xray images 
of the body from 360 degrees 
computerized tomography was previously used on mummies by a team 
from brigham and womens hospital and the museum of fine arts in 
boston 
the mummy of a petite woman was originally brought to the united 
states in the 1870s by the rev john franklin goucher for whom 
goucher college in baltimore is named 
were excited about learning more said dr betsy bryan 
professor of near eastern studies at johns hopkins university i 
guess shes taken on a personality for us shes become a real 
person 
and by using xrays and the ct scanner we can leave her 
intact well still have a very wellpreserved mummy 
xrays already taken at the hospital this year revealed that the 
mummy was female and a mother about 50 years old when she died 
weighed 105 pounds and had good hipbones and teeth except for a 
missing molar and an impacted wisdom tooth 
early results of the ct scan showed two packages in the mummys 
chest and an unexplained hole in her head dr fishman said 
the mummification process first practiced as early as 3000 
bc had evolved by the time the woman died around 500 bc of 
unknown causes into a complicated ritual lasting more than two 
months dr bryan said 
the brain was removed through the nostrils to keep the head 
intact internal organs were removed with the heart often returned 
to the chest cavity after preserving with a salt known as natron 
the remains were wrapped in linen coated with resin and placed in 
a coffin for burial 
the johns hopkins mummy was not of royal birth so burial in a 
pyramid was out of the question said dr bryan she was probably 
middleclass buried in a wooden sarcophagus in the desert 
there was some damage from grave robbers her tightly crossed 
arms and wrists once wore bracelets and the robbers slashed her 
chest in removing the jewelry dr bryan said 
but her skin is still there her hair and everything said 
dr giraud foster an associate profesor of obstetrics and 
gynecology at the jhu medical school were amazed at how well 
she is preserved

a national newspaper on friday blamed poor 
sanitation and incest in the central asian republics for a high 
soviet infant mortality rate 
the labor newspaper trud said the national average for infant 
mortality is 25 deaths per 1000 live births but that the rate went 
as high as 70 per 1000 in some areas of central asia 
the us rate is 10 infant deaths per 1000 births according to 
1987 figures 
women in the central asian republics often take their familys 
drinking water from irrigation ditches the newspaper said this 
leads to intestinal infections cited as the cause of many of the 
infant deaths trud said 
some hospitals in the region lack indoor plumbing and running 
water the report said and many women in central asia have their 
children one after another which can weaken their bodies and 
produce weak and undernourished offspring 
the tendency of some central asian ethnic groups to intermarry 
also was blamed for raising the infant mortality rate 
an article in the daily komsomolskaya pravda last month said 
incest was the major factor in the soviet unions high infant death 
rate 
in contrast trud said the 11 per 1000 infant mortality rate 
in the baltic republics of latvia lithuania and estonia is equal 
to or lower than that of the united states and west european 
nations 
trud said improved living conditions and sex education in 
underdeveloped areas of central asia were needed to rectify the 
infant mortality problem

republican gov arch moore has battled 
back into the lead against a millionaire primary challenger who 
seeks to deny him a shot at a fourth term as leader of this 
financially troubled state 
seven democrats are seeking their partys nomination for 
governor in tuesdays election with polls showing the two 
frontrunners too close to call in an increasingly strident race 
moores opponent is morgantown businessman john raese a coal 
steel and media company owner who narrowly lost to thengov jay 
rockefeller in the 1984 us senate election 
he has accused moore of waging a rose garden campaign 
refusing to debate him and relying on his status as governor to 
carry him through the election 
moore 65 claims to have cut taxes by 311 million in the past 
four years although he fought most of the cuts when they were 
imposed by the legislature 
he also cites his accomplishments at bringing news businesses 
and bringing 30000 jobs to the state although the total number of 
employed west virginians has increased by just 5700 since moore 
took office in 1985 
moore insists that the state is making an economic recovery but 
raese and the democrats say otherwise mario palumbo a state 
senator from charleston says the state will face a 400 million 
deficit when the fiscal year ends june 30 and should declare 
bankruptcy raese says moore has made just 10 percent of 385 
million in budget cuts recommended by the governors task force on 
waste management 
the 38yearold raese who inherited much of his wealth has 
gained a reputation of a rich kid who loves fast boats and hard 
living at a dallas hotel in 1984 while attending the republican 
national convention raese grabbed a newspaper reporter by the 
lapels and proclaimed i buy and sell reporters like you every 
day 
earlier this week raeses wife liz called her husband a 
mans man and said he is not the party animal many people 
believe him to be 
sure john loves fast cars and fast boats when he gets 
stressed out thats his release she said in fact we have 
our best love affairs in the middle of the ocean there is solitude 
out there youre alone 
when republicans were surveyed april 1318 for the west virginia 
poll raese had a 54 percent to 30 percent lead but moore had not 
yet begun his television and newspaper advertising and in the past 
two weeks he has been on the road campaigning almost constantly 
promising state money for various projects and announcing plant 
openings in elkins and south charleston 
in a new poll conducted monday through wednesday moore was 
favored 48 percent to 35 percent the copyright poll conducted for 
the associated press charleston daily mail and wsaztv by 
ryansamples research inc is based on telephone interviews 
conducted with 306 registered democrats and 275 registered 
republicans and independents selected at random it had a margin of 
error of 56 percent 
on the democratic side clyde see 46 and gaston caperton 48 
have waged an expensive battle of television commercials accusing 
each other of various misdeeds 
see a former house of delegates speaker and the partys 1984 
nominee for governor has ridiculed capertons business practices 
and his refusal to sign a voluntary campaign spending limit 
sees ads point out that a study found a 25 percent error rate 
in state claims processed by capertons insurance company 
mcdonough caperton insurance group of charleston the company 
handles the state employee insurance system 
caperton has responded by saying he built the nations 18th 
largest insurance company and accused see of engaging in 
oldstyle politics and a dirty campaign full of distortion 
in the latest west virginia poll among democrats surveyed 
caperton was named by 30 percent while see was picked by 29 
percent with the rest divided among the five other candidates or 
undecided 
caperton has also come under fire for his heavy spending in a 
statement filed with the secretary of state on wednesday he listed 
18 million in campaign expenses more than three times that of 
any other candidate 
i have had to use tv because i came into the race relatively 
unknown said caperton making his first try for public office 
the criticism from the other candidates is nothing more than a 
show of frustration and desperation

the beatification of father junipero serra 
means the roman catholic church is finally coming to appreciate 
us history says a diocesan spokesman but his detractors blame 
the founder of the mission system for helping destroy indian 
culture 
the vatican will beatify serra an 18thcentury priest and one 
of the first europeans in california on sept 25 beatification is 
one step from sainthood and many in the church here hope it will 
lead to sainthood for serra 
a contingent of roman catholic bishops from california plans to 
travel to rome for the ceremony 
the church has finally caught up to us history said ted 
elisee spokesman for the diocese of monterey where serra is 
buried at the carmel mission basilica 
he has been called californias first citizen he was a great 
historical figure in the us and the church is catching up with 
him said elisee for those who are devoted to him this is an 
affirmation and a confirmation of their belief for them this is a 
great moment 
serra a franciscan born on the island of majorca established 
the first of nine missions in san diego in 1769 altogether 21 
missions were created by his order from san diego to sonoma 
when the pope visited the united states last year he stopped at 
serras grave and lauded his work 
serras remains were exhumed in 1943 for archaeological and 
canonical purposes then reburied in the middle vault in a copper 
coffin with an airtight glass inner lid the coffin was sealed 
with brass wire then marked with images of the virgin mary and 
with crosses 
in may 1985 serra was declared venerable by the church once 
roman catholic authorities agreed that serra had accomplished one 
miracle beatification was in line if a second miracle can be 
confirmed serra can be declared a saint 
the first miracle involved the recovery of franciscan sister 
boniface dyrda now 71 and living in st louis who was diagnosed 
as fatally ill in 1960 she recovered from what was found to be 
lupus tuberculosis of the skin after she and her order prayed to 
serra elisee said 
indian groups have opposed honors for serra who they say 
subjected indian converts to corporal punishment and forcibly kept 
them inside the missions where they were separated by sex and 
required to do farming and construction tasks 
his actions including stealing indian lands and exposing 
indians to european diseases for which they had no resistance 
helped destroy indian culture the critics say

carnations roses and memories will fill a 
chapel when sons and daughters gather to honor their mothers 
sunday 80 years after the nations first mothers day service was 
celebrated here 
we expect to have a full house we usually do said lenore 
shafer a tour guide at the mothers day shrine i think 
everybody has a feeling for their mother 
everybody doesnt have children but everybody has a mother 
tourists from all 50 states england canada and even japan have 
visited the shrine located in a former methodist church built in 
1872 shafer said 
some like the hardcarved pews others come to see our stained 
glass windows and murals said betty hayhurst chairwoman of the 
committee that oversees the shrine a lot of young people come 
here too its not just old people 
anna jarvis the founder of national mothers day spelled out 
its purpose in a letter to organizers 80 years ago to revive the 
dormant love and filial gratitude we owe to those who gave us 
birth to brighten the lives of good mothers to have them know 
we appreciate them though we do not often show it as we might 
the first mothers day celebration on may 10 1908 at andrews 
methodist church in grafton and another at wanamakers auditorium 
in philadelphia that afternoon marked the death of miss jarvis 
mother anna maria jarvis three years earlier 
back in the 1850s when the area around grafton was still part 
of virginia mrs jarvis had been spurred to work against 
unsanitary living conditions in the region by the deaths of eight 
of her 12 children before they reached adulthood 
her mothers day work clubs in grafton and nearby towns were 
so successful that doctors urged others to follow her example the 
clubs also won praise for easing hostility among neighbors during 
the civil war when the slavery issue divided families and 
ultimately divided virginia itself 
throughout the last years of her life mrs jarvis shared her 
dream of a day set aside for the mothers of the world living and 
dead with anna 
but she did not live long enough to see her dream come true 
according to the book mothers day and the mothers day 
church anna then a 41yearold spinster vowed to herself to 
establish mothers day as her mothers casket was being lowered 
into her grave at west chester pa 
the idea soon became an obsession as miss jarvis worked to 
promote the day with personal appearances and letterwriting 
campaigns 
she finally persuaded john wanamaker a philadelphia merchant 
and philanthropist to support her in her quest wanamaker later 
became part of a committee along with food manufacturer hj 
heinz that mapped out a program to extend mothers day around the 
world 
after the first celebration in 1908 the idea caught on quickly 
and by the following year mothers day was observed in at least one 
town in nearly all the states as well as puerto rico canada and 
mexico 
a year later gov william e glasscock proclaimed the second 
sunday in may as mothers day in west virginia and in 1914 
president woodrow wilson did the same for the whole country 
flowers have been part of mothers day since miss jarvis sent 
500 white carnations chosen to represent purity to grafton for 
the first celebration participants were urged to wear a red 
carnation if their mother was living and white if their mother was 
dead 
it is definitely the biggest holiday of the year for us 
said rocky pollitz vice president of industry relations for 
teleflora the nations largest independently owned floral company 
people may not think of sending flowers all year but on 
mothers day everybody thinks of flowers 
many whose mothers have died send flowers to the shrine 
hayhurst said the flowers are taken to nursing homes and hospitals 
following the mothers day service

the government friday ordered an arabamerican 
leader of palestinian resistance to leave the country and accused 
him of preaching violence the united states and leftwing 
israelis sought to prevent the deportation 
the move to deport 44yearold mubarak awad was the latest 
israeli action aimed at breaking the back of palestinian resistance 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip that resistance has been 
built on strikes and other protest techniques awad advocated 
the united states asked israel to delay awads deportation while 
us ambassador thomas pickering met with foreign minister shimon 
peres and asked israel to reconsider the order israel television 
reported 
in the occupied west bank israeli troops blocked all commerce 
for the second straight day the soldiers shut down shops and gas 
stations halted transit and even chased away street vendors 
the government has been trying to force merchants to open and 
close on israeli orders not at the dictates of uprising leaders 
and troops have threatened to weld shut the doors of shops whose 
merchants disobey soldiers orders 
authorities arrested an americanborn jewish settler in the 
fatal shooting of a palestinian shepherd israel radio said police 
would recommend charging the settler yisrael zeev with murder 
zeev allegedly shot the arab in the head thursday when he 
refused to move his flock from near the shiloh jewish settlement 
near ramallah and some shepherds threw rocks at shiloh guards 
according to palestinian reports and the radio 
in the occupied gaza strip israeli troops shot and wounded 
three arab protesters in gaza city shifa hospital officials said 
one of the victims was a 12yearold boy 
awad who runs the center for nonviolent studies in jerusalem 
was presented with a deportation order before dawn after being 
arrested at his jerusalem home awads attorney jonathan kuttab 
said his client probably would appeal to the supreme court 
leaders of the 5monthold palestinian uprising in the west bank 
and gaza strip have adopted many of awads strategies of peaceful 
resistance including commercial strikes nonpayment of taxes 
boycotting israeli products and sitin demonstrations against the 
occupation 
avi pazner spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
awad was ordered deported because he had gone beyond calls for 
nonviolent protest and was responsible for leaflets that urged 
palestinians to throw gasoline bombs and rocks 
this is preaching violence pazner said adding that awad 
had also called for a palestinian state that would include all of 
israel shamir who also heads the interior ministry signed the 
deportation order 
in a statement delivered friday by attorney kuttab awad said he 
supported the establishment of a palestinian state alongside israel 
i also believe the palestinians can get their rights through 
nonviolence and a campaign of civil disobedience this has been 
the message of the uprising it is a much better way than our 
attempting to kill one another the statement said 
according to un figures 184 palestinians have been killed 
since the uprising began dec 8 an israeli soldier and an israeli 
teenager have died 
kuttab who met with awad in jail said his client was somber 
they are trying to cut all his ties with his own country it 
is very serious he said 
the jerusalemborn awad who also has a home in wapakoneta 
ohio was in israel on a tourist visa that expired last november 
and he refused an order to leave the country awad was allowed to 
remain following strong us pressure 
fridays deportation order elicited protests from some leftwing 
israelis 
in a telegram to shamir legislator yossi sarid said you can 
deport awad but not his positions which are those of a moderate 
palestinian if israel cant talk to awad then we really only 
know how to shoot 
a group of american jews living in israel met with us 
consulgeneral philip wilcox to urge american action against the 
deportation we protest the discriminatory treatment that israel 
metes out to american citizens depending on whether they are jewish 
or arab said john ostfild of minneapolis 
chief of staff gen dan shomron said he believed the measures to 
choke off the palestinian uprising had succeeded in starting a 
process of disillusionment 
the arabs now understand they cannot achieve their aims 
andtheir suffering is for nothing shomron told the daily 
yediot ahronot 
the daily maariv reported about 60000 european tourists had 
canceled plans to travel to israel because of the unrest the 
newspaper said 407 charter flights scheduled for april through 
october had been called off

saying the city has a serious problem with stray dogs 
the town adams said has received angry phone calls and hate 
mail over the incident people have looked at one side of the 
story 
the dogs frequent companions to a disabled veteran were shot 
by sgt james mock a witness and the ofekenofee humane society in 
nearby waycross obtained warrants from a probate judge charging 
mock with cruelty to animals he is free on 500 bond 
adams said the georgia bureau of investigation asked to 
investigate had decided no crime was committed 
the town he said has bought a tranquilizer gun and police 
will be taught to use it 
we love animals as much as anyone else the mayor said 
were not out to kill dogs only eliminate dogs that we 
consider dangerous to human life 
adams also disputed claims by harriett dixon director of the 
humane society that up to eight dogs may have died in the april 29 
incident 
to set the record straight only two dogs were killed he 
said three shots were fired one or more of which killed one dog 
and critically wounded the other the officer took his baton and 
finished killing the second dog 
since the humane society became involved ms dixon said she 
has received telephone threats to stay out of blackshear 
this is not the first time this has happened she said 
dogs have been shot in front of peoples homes the people 
telling me these things are afraid to identify themselves 
adams said 61yearold elliott trueluck had been warned 
repeatedly to keep the dogs outside the city which has a leash 
law trueluck is wellknown in blackshear because he strolls to a 
restaurant just about every morning followed by a pack of dogs 
adams cited an ordinance that gives police the authority to kill 
vicious animals police he said had received numerous complaints 
about truelucks dogs 
police chief dennis martin said one of the dogs once tried to 
attack a waitress at the restaurant and others had almost caused an 
auto accident while fighting in a street in the south georgia town 
of 3500 people 
city officials have said trueluck laughed off the warnings 
trueluck said he has been afraid to walk to town since the 
shooting 
it scared the idontknowwhat out of me he said

as an advocate of nonviolence mubarak awad 
would seem to be the type of palestinian leader the israeli 
government could accept 
but israel declared the jerusalemborn american a danger to the 
state and ordered him deported protests by the united states 
halted earlier efforts to deport awad who lived 15 years in the 
midwest and holds us citizenship 
awad has called for his fellow arabs to use nonviolent means 
rather than stonethrowing or gunfire to express their longing for 
a homeland 
but awads strategy of strikes boycotts and noncooperation has 
helped fuel the current palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories he also has made clear that like armed plo 
guerrillas he wants an independent palestine 
awad 44 is founder of the palestinian center for the study of 
nonviolence and says his ideas come from the passive resistance of 
mohandas k gandhi the indian leader known as the mahatma or 
great soul 
his gentle manner adds to the impression that he is an advocate 
of peace one friend commented that the softspoken awad must have 
been very good at what he did for years counseling juvenile 
delinquents in ohio 
awad for all his advocacy of nonviolence also has not 
condemned palestinian guerrillas asked recently about his thoughts 
on palestinian fighters he replied 
they have the right if they think they can achieve things 
with guns that is up to them i cannot achieve things with guns i 
dont think it achieves anything 
an israeli statement accuses awad of encouraging civil 
disobedience which he has advocated but also of helping prepare 
leaflets that call for violence against israel 
awads wife nancy nye from wilmington ohio denies her husband 
authored such leaflets and insists he does not want to destroy 
israel but she added no matter where he is he will be working 
for palestinian independence 
awad was born in jerusalem in 1943 before the creation of 
israel 
ms nye said awads father was shot and killed in the 1948 
arabisraeli war when he left the family home to help a wounded 
man awad was brought up by his mother a nurse 
a year after israel captured arab east jerusalem in the 1967 
middle east war awad went to the united states to study and 
received a masters degree from saint francis college in fort 
wayne ind 
he settled in wapakoneta ohio became a youth counselor and 
founded a string of counseling services he has two children by a 
previous marriage who live in bluffton ohio 
awad began returning to jerusalem on visits in 1983 and two 
years later came back for good his calls for strikes and boycotts 
of israeli goods have caused him regular trouble with authorities 
he has been arrested at least four times last november israel 
refused to renew his tourist visa and tried to deport him then 
but after five months of a sustained arab uprising israel 
seemed to have no hesitation about expelling the man who says 
nonviolence is the way to palestinian independence

a widow says shell find another way to help 
others now that health officials have told her she has to stop 
taking homemade soup and sandwiches to homeless people at a park 
doraine frick has been taking food paid for through donations 
of her prayer group and cooked in her own kitchen to pioneer park 
in this phoenix suburb every wednesday for about two years but the 
meal served wednesday to about 30 people was the last she said 
thursday 
mrs frick 58 said she wont fight the edict by the maricopa 
county health department adding that she considers it gods 
message for her to move on to another ministry 
but this isnt right said dave peck a homeless man who 
said hes been hanging around pioneer park since 1982 these 
ladies go out of their way to come down here to feed people that 
are living on the streets 
peck said mrs frick and her helper lelia parlier also have 
brought razors blankets clothing toothpaste and toothbrushes to 
the park 
they go out of their way he said theyll walk around the 
park and ask people if they are hungry 
roy willis a health department supervisor said the county had 
no choice but to halt mrs fricks operation after a city employee 
filed a complaint with the department april 27 
all food must come from an approved source and be prepared in 
an approved kitchen willis said calling mrs fricks operation 
illegal under any circumstances 
you just cant prepare food out of your home and take it and 
give it away or sell it or whatever to the general public or 
anybody else willis said by law we have to have control over 
how the food is prepared handled and given away to prevent people 
from getting sick 
he said the law protects mrs frick too 
if we get a mass foodborne illness her liability would be 
unbelievable willis said 
after a county health officer left a notice at her home to cease 
feeding people from food made in her home mrs frick said she 
went to the park and told the homeless we would not be coming 
back anymore 
mrs frick said she went each thursday to hillman catholic 
renewal center in glendale where her prayer group collected money 
to buy the food she put into the weekly meals for the poor 
she said she wanted to use the kitchen at queen of peace 
catholic church which she attends but she said it is committed to 
the church schools hot lunch program 
willis said if the meals were prepared in a church his 
inspectors would examine the kitchen and waive the permit fee 
if someone doesnt feed the poor mrs frick said you are 
going to find more crime in the city i feel ive done a lot of 
good helping these guys and giving them hope they know somebody 
cares

any provisional government the afghan 
resistance creates as a rival to the sovietbacked regime in kabul 
would need to control some territory and meet other criteria to 
merit us recognition the state department said friday 
such a government also would have to be broadly supported by the 
afghan people and have an effective structure and the ability 
to undertake the valid international obligations of a state the 
department said 
the statement marked the departments first public discussion of 
conditions under which it might recognize a provisional regime 
the possibility that ussupported guerrillas in afghanistan 
might form such a government has heightened since last month when 
the soviet union signed an agreement to withdraw its estimated 
115000 troops from the country within nine months 
a provisional regime would presumably be a framework for the 
government the resistance forces hope to install in kabul to 
replace the weakened sovietback administration of afghan leader 
najibullah 
talk about a provisional government has also been spurred by the 
increasing number of predictions inside afghanistan and by western 
observers that the collapse of the najibullah government is certain 
once the soviets leave 
zalmay khalilzad an adviser to undersecretary of state michael 
armacost met with resistance leaders recently and reportedly 
outlined the criteria under which a provisional government would be 
acceptable to the united states 
the resistance is well aware of our views state department 
spokesman charles e redman said there are a number of important 
criteria for any government to have international acceptability 
the test is whether a government controls territory has an 
effective government structure possesses the capacity to exercise 
the valid international obligations and enjoys broad support he 
said 
redman cautioned that it would be premature to disclose 
when or under exactly what conditions we would be prepared to 
establish relations with any government in afghanistan he would 
not for example define how much territory a government must 
control or how strongly its grip must be 
the united states is not involved in any efforts to form a 
provisional government with the resistance or anyone else 
the first essential step is for the soviets to pull their 
forces out which will create an evironment more conducive to a 
genuine process of selfdetermination and establish a more broadly 
based government redman said 
the spokesman belittled the significance of reports by indian 
officials that najibullah expressed an interest during talks in new 
delhi in sharing power with the guerrilla groups 
its clear that pdpa najibullahs party lacks popular 
support among the afghan people redman said hes made these 
professions of interest in powersharing before and his 
formulations have always lacked credibility and still do theyve 
never addressed the issue of genuine powersharing but rather 
amount to pdpa domination of the government 
since joining the soviets in signing the afghan withdrawal

nasa may almost have been too successful in its 
campaign to put men on the moon said americas first astronaut in 
a speech marking the 27th anniversary of his brief ride into space 
nasa became overloaded too successful they did too good a 
job said alan shepard commenting on the disaster that destroyed 
the space shuttle challenger 
shephard became the first to ride a mercury capsule into space 
on may 5 1961 shortly afterwards president john kennedy announced 
that the nation would attempt to land men on the moon before the

shepard followed his 15minute suborbital trip aboard freedom 7 
by commanding the apollo 14 mission to the moon in 1971 
the former astronaut now a businessman spoke at a rotary club 
of houston luncheon thursday 
if 30 years ago we had said that we were only going to have 
two incidents when we had fatalities all of us would have said i 
just hope we are that lucky shepard said the odds were just 
not that good 30 years ago 
seven crew members died when challenger exploded in 1986 and 
three astronauts died in a 1967 fire at the kennedy space center

the painter and engraver william stanley hayter 
who taught his innovative printmaking techniques to such renowned 
artists as pablo picasso and salvador dali is dead at age 86 
hayter died of cardiac arrest wednesday in paris where he had 
been a leading figure in the art scene since the 1920s 
the international herald tribune said friday that hayter was 
credited with turning engraving into a lively and experimental form 
that attracted many famous artists to his studio in montparnasse 
among those visiting the studio he called atelier 17 were 
alexander calder marc chagall jackson pollock dali and picasso 
hayter was born in london in 1901 and graduated from kings 
college london with honor degrees in art and chemistry he worked 
in iran from 1922 to 1925 for the angloiranian oil co but his 
first interest was art 
my father was a painter and so were a lot of people in my 
family before so i was messing about with painting fairly 
seriously when i was a child he once said i was painting all 
the time when i was in the middle east i didnt do much with 
prints until i came to paris 
he discovered the vanishing art of original printmaking and 
revolutionized it with new techniques including a method of color 
printing from a single plate instead of using a separate plate for 
each tone 
hayter wrote two books that are essential reading for print 
makers new ways of gravure 1949 and about prints 1962 
he lived in paris from 1926 to 1939 when he moved his studio to 
the new school in new york and gave impetus american printmaking

procedures for defense examination of 
classified documents in the irancontra conspiracy case were 
discussed friday in a closed hearing convened by us district 
judge gerhard a gesell 
gesell convened the hearing to question government security 
officials about what he had termed a lack of progress in the 
production of classified documents he ruled the defense could 
examine 
but after a lengthy discussion gesell reportedly told lawyers 
in the case that progress had been made toward eliminating some 
procedural obstacles to defense review of the material 
retired marine lt col oliver l north former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and retired air force maj gen 
richard v secord attended the hearing with their attorneys 
businessman albert hakim the fourth defendant in the case did 
not attend but was represented by his lawyers 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh has collected some 300000 
pages of classified documents of which he says 50000 are relevant 
to the case gesell has ordered that the defense be allowed to 
examine all 300000 pages 
the judge has said the defendants must be allowed to review the 
material with their lawyers but court security officials have 
barred hakim from seeing the documents because he has never had a 
government security clearance 
the other three defendants all had highlevel clearances 
although secord has been in private business for several years 
secord has also encountered procedural obstacles to his 
examination of documents according to court papers filed in the 
case 
gesell convened the hearing after learning from walsh earlier 
this week that 105000 pages of classified material had been 
deposited in a special secure facility constructed by the justice 
department for use by the defense lawyers to work with the 
documents 
the four defendants are charged with conspiring to defraud the 
government by diverting profits from the usiran arms sales to 
the nicaraguan contra rebels 
the judge had previously warned that unless the defense gets 
access to the material and is able to obtain government 
declassification of relevant documents he might be forced to 
dismiss charges in the case 
under the classified information procedures act secret 
documents must be declassified by government agencies before they 
can be introduced as evidence 
in ordering the hearing gesell said he was dismayed by the 
apparent lack of progress being made in declassifying essential 
papers

american hostages in lebanon were brutally 
mistreated for trying to escape from their proiranian captors a 
freed french hostage was quoted as saying friday 
journalist jeanpaul kauffmann shared a cell recently with 
american frank herbert reed who was mistreated to the point of 
being left prostrate kauffmanns sister mariegenevieve dagin 
was quoted as saying 
reed was director of the lebanese international school when he 
was captured sept 9 1986 
mrs dagins comments were reported by agence francepresse one 
day after kauffmann and two other frenchmen arrived in paris 
following their release in lebanon 
kauffmann and the other frenchmen diplomats marcel carton and 
marcel fontaine were released from valdegrace military hospital 
friday after receiving medical examinations 
kauffmann in his own interview friday with the french news 
agency said the remaining western hostages in lebanon were my 
main concern i ask their families to remain patient and stay 
confident he was also quoted as saying he read the novel war 
and peace 21 times during his captivity 
in a separate statement issued after the dispatch quoting his 
sister kauffmann said he intended to comment more about the other 
hostages next week and did not want anyone relaying his impressions 
until then 
a woman who answered mrs dagins telephone in rennes on friday 
said she was out of town and could not be reached 
mrs dagin was quoted by afp as saying kauffmann told her the 
american hostages held by the proiranian shiite moslem group 
islamic jihad were the object of brutality because they tried to 
escape 
there are 18 foreigners missing in lebanon including nine 
americans the hostage held longest is terry a anderson 40 chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press he was captured 
march 16 1985 
the afp dispatch did not make clear if kauffmann specified which 
hostages were mistreated for attempting to get away 
french officials meanwhile defended the circumstances under 
which the hostages were released premier jacques chirac condemned 
those who try to insinuate that france made a deal with iran 
i say solemnly i say on my honor that no negotiation no 
compromise no bargaining no deal took place with any foreign 
government or even less with any terrorist group he said 
agence francepresse citing unidentified sources it said were 
close to french negotiators said france and iran agreed to resume 
formal diplomatic relations under a 40day schedule beginning the 
day the hostages were freed 
france also has confirmed reports that onethird of a 1 billion 
loan iran made to france in 1974 has been paid other reports have 
said the remainder is to be paid in return for freeing kauffmann 
carton and fontaine 
the widow of french hostage michel seurat said friday she wanted 
an official inquiry into her husbands death seurat was kidnapped 
with kauffmann in may 1985 and died in captivity 
mary seurat said chirac also should demand seurats body be 
returned to france 
i want his remains so i can bury them in a country where even 
dogs can have gravestones she said 
in her interview mrs dagin was quoted as saying that she 
learned from her brother that fontaine was briefly held with terry 
waite the special envoy of the archbishop of canterbury waite 
disappeared jan 20 1987 while on a mission in lebanon seeking 
the hostages release 
she said her brother found no excuse for his kidnappers for 
whom he feels only hate 
the agency quoted her as saying kauffmann considered using a 
private signal to his son gregoire wiggling his nose to 
indicate he was lying when making videotapes under coercion in 
which he appealed to the french government to do more to win his 
freedom 
he decided not to make the sign because he feared the 
consequences if it were discovered she quoted im as saying 
kauffmann was quoted as saying some of his captors treated him 
humanely but one never let up with the humiliations not to 
mention a simulated execution in june 1987 that was particularly 
trying 
when i felt discouraged i prayed and the next day some little 
signs would let me climb back up again he said

the presidential task force appointed last 
fall to study the october stock market crash says progress toward 
reforming the market should not be sidetracked by turf battles 
among federal regulators 
a statement released thursday by the new york office of nicholas 
f brady a wall street investment banker who headed the 
presidential panel said the flaws in the mechanisms that govern 
our equity markets are still in place and must be addressed 
the statement said debate over market reform has concentrated 
on who should oversee the needed changes rather than on what 
should be reformed on which the statement said there is much 
more agreement 
selfinterest and turf battles among the regulators and 
exchanges cannot be allowed to stand in the way of necessary reform 
of a limited number of issues that cut across marketplaces it 
said 
the statement was released three days after brady met with a 
reagan administration working group which is formulating specific 
suggestions for reforming the markets 
that panel headed by treasury undersecretary george gould and 
comprising the chairmen of the federal reserve board securities 
and exchange commission and commodity futures trading commission 
is due to report to president reagan later this month 
according to sources familiar with the groups work it is 
unlikely to go along with the brady panels recommendation that the 
federal reserve or a coordinating committee of regulators should 
get authority to coordinate stock trading and stock index futures 
trading 
brady is backing legislation sponsored by senate banking 
committee chairman william proxmire dwis which would create a 
coordinating body chaired by the head of the federal reserve board 
the brady panels statement warned that it would be a mistake 
to abandon the development of appropriate legislation 
two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said it 
appeared that the working group was making progress toward an 
agreement on coordinated circuit breakers which would halt 
trading when markets take an extreme dive or climb 
however the sources said there was less agreement on 
coordinating margins which set the amount of money required to 
make an investment in either the futures or stock market although 
the margins work differently in each market they currently are 
lower in the futures markets 
the five members of the brady task force said it is essential 
to harmonize the level of margins adding that margin setting was 
too important to leave to the exchanges 
the federal reserve sets margins for stocks and stock options 
while individual futures exchanges set their own margins 
in the world of one market it makes little sense to provide 
investors with different degrees of leverage depending on whether 
they enter through the stock or derivative futures door the 
panel wrote 
regarding circuit breakers the brady commission said it was 
encouraged by the work of the new york stock exchange and the 
chicago mercantile exchange toward coordinating market halts 
however it warned that circuit breakers should not be set at 
levels that cause them to be triggered frequently 
it also criticized a new york stock exchange move to restrict 
computerized program trading when the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks swings up or down by 50 points 
that kind of circuit breaker it said runs the risk of 
disconnecting the marketplaces an outcome we believe would 
destabilize the market as a whole 
the brady panel praised the efforts of the exchanges to expand 
trading capacity easing the possibility that extremely high 
trading volume would cause a breakdown of the market 
however let us not fool ourselves merely increasing market 
capacity will not assure that a repeat of october will be 
averted it said 
in addition to brady head of dillon read amp co the panel 
members are robert kirby chairman of capital guardian trust co 
john opel former ibm chairman james c cotting navistar 
international corp chairman and howard stein dreyfus corp 
chairman

at 33 michael p fontana was a rising star in a 
prestigious law firm with an impeccable reputation and credentials 
to match 
but 10 years after he was hired fontana revealed that he failed 
to graduate from law school and never passed the bar examination a 
senior partner with the firm said friday 
we are just sick about this said harold shapiro an 
attorney with sonnenschein carlin nath amp rosenthal which has 
about 200 attorneys its more than difficult its 
heartbreaking 
fontana was fired immediately after he told the firm the truth 
shapiro said the law firm had no other choice somebody whos 
been a partner who turns out not to be a lawyer cannot be 
retained he said in a telephone interview 
his performance with us was simply firstrate and until his 
revelations there was not a single instance of unprofessional 
conduct known to us the partners and associates of this firm are 
shocked and saddened by this event shapiro said 
fontana reached at home friday said i dont have anything 
to say 
william j harte fontanas attorney said his client was 
overwhelmed and declined to discuss the case 
fontana started with the firm in 1977 as a summer law clerk at 
the end of his second year at the university of michigans law 
school considered among the top law schools he had been associate 
editor of the schools law review shapiro said 
he was offered a job upon graduation and joined the firm 
fulltime in 1978 
fontana who worked as a general litigator was respected for 
his ability to present a case in court shapiro said and was 
promoted to junior partner three years ago 
he was wellliked by colleagues at the firm shapiro said 
like doesnt really say it he was loved still is 
but on april 25 shapiro said fontana revealed to us for the 
first time that he had not graduated from law school that he left 
school in december 1977 short one credit hour that he had intended 
to make up that hour with a paper but had failed to do so 
as a consequence of this he did not take the bar exam in 
1978 although he told the firm that he had and later that he had 
passed the exam shapiro said 
he would not say how the firm learned the truth and would not 
discuss how the firm checks credentials of potential employees 
shapiro would not comment on whether the firm plans legal or 
disciplinary action against fontana but an attorney who 
specializes in defending lawyers charged with malpractice said 
fontana and his former law firm could face troublesome issues 
you have the potential exposure for malpractice claims 
barring statute of limitations issues and there would have to be 
a tiein between an adverse result to client and the showing that 
result was due to negligence on part of the lawyer and the lack of 
qualification said john roadhouse 
authorities at the university of michigan law school could not 
be reached for comment susan eklund dean of student affairs did 
not return phone calls 
a student at the law review confirmed that fontana had worked on 
the review about 10 years ago

some residents here want to bury the 
hatchet as it were and establish a display to commemorate the 
citys most notorious daughter lizzie borden 
but others say that honoring the woman who was acquitted 96 
years ago of the brutal ax murders of her parents would be like 
opening a museum for the boston strangler or lee harvey oswald 
a promoters proposal to offer a lizzie borden audiovisual 
display at heritage state park for a year or so charging admission 
and splitting the proceeds with the state will be the subject of a 
public hearing later this month 
it has split the city brad durfee acting chamber of 
commerce president said friday people are talking on the 
streets about it and its stirred up things really 
ive seen some people who are outspokenly against it and ive 
seen others who are outspokenly for it said ken fiola director 
of project management at the fall river office of economic 
management right now id say that its 5050 
the dispute is the latest chapter in the controversy over 
borden a prim 32yearold sunday school teacher when the grisly 
killings of her merchant father and her stepmother in august 1892 
put the textile mill town 40 miles south of boston on the map 
claiming she was out of the house when the killings occurred 
miss borden was found innocent of the slayings a year later but no 
murderer was ever found and the case refuses to die 
despite the court ruling several experts have written books 
contending that borden who died in 1927 was the perpetrator and 
have offered various motives 
she also was immortalized in plays and the grim childrens 
rhyme lizzie borden took an ax and gave her mother 40 whacks 
when she saw what she had done she gave her father 41 
some opponents of the proposal argue against any borden exhibit 
saying that it would serve to glorify an unsavory aspect of the 
citys past and besmirch the community of just over 90000 just 
when it is trying to rid itself of its gritty milltown image 
others take issue with staging it in a state park depicting the 
exhibit as a pure profitseeking enterprise that has no place on 
land set aside by massachusetts for the free enjoyment of all 
the park was never meant to be a moneymaking venture said 
stephen lopes chairman of the parks steering committee 
literally hundreds of people support my stand on this 
particular issue lopes said 
theyre telling me that the city has made great progress and 
to go back to the negative and unsolved murders of two prominent 
citizens is totally out of concept 
but promoter paul r mulvihill the originator of the plan to 
create an audiovisual production with recreations of the borden 
house courtroom and trial sought to downplay such concerns 
id say 60 percent of the people here would like the legend to 
be recreated said mulvihill who was involved in establishing 
the popular salem witch museum that examines the famous 18th 
century trials of that massachusetts town 
he estimates the admission charge for his proposed venture would 
be 350 and that the program would be offered at the parks 
visitor center for roughly a year 
mulvihill argued that both the city and the state would benefit 
financially from a borden exhibit adding that state parks have a 
mandate to educate citizens 
fiola concurred saying any display would serve as an 
educational forum and the spinoff from the expected tourist draw 
would translate into money for the city and the state

saying the country is fed up with 
whitecollar crime the head of the justice departments 
antitrust division friday urged longer jail terms for business 
executives engaging in pricefixing and larger fines for companies 
engaging in anticompetitive practices 
assistant attorney general charles rule said there is a trend 
toward more jail time and heavier fines in antitrust cases but 
the averages are still too low recently enacted federal 
sentencing guidelines should result in more severe penalties rule 
said in remarks prepared for release in san francisco copies of 
his speech to a lawyers group were released in washington 
rule said the average jail term imposed on all people convicted 
in antitrust division cases in the past 10 years was less than two 
months 
this country is fed up with whitecollar crime and wants 
judges to start treating whitecollar criminals like the crooks 
they really are rule said antitrust crimes are nothing more 
than sophisticated larceny 
newly instituted federal sentencing guidelines require judges to 
sentence antitrust defendants to confinement for a minimum of four 
months 
in addition the guidelines require fines based on the volume of 
commerce attributable to the defendant an individual conspirator 
must be fined from four percent to 10 percent of the volume of the 
commerce done by him in goods or services that were affected by the 
conspiracy but not less than 20000 
for corporations and other organizations the guidelines provide 
for fines ranging from 20 percent to 50 percent of the volume of 
commerce done by the organization in goods or services affected by 
the violation but not less than 100000 the maximum corporate 
fine now is 1 million 
while we are now witnessing an increased willingness of judges 
to take antitrust felonies seriously some judges in the past have 
shown undue lenience toward antitrust criminals rule said 
rule said a recent study estimates that the justice departments 
prosecution of 52 pricefixing conspiracies from 1962 to 1980 
prevented the theft of about 2 billion that the conspiracies would 
have achieved had they not been stopped the department has brought 
560 cases in the past seven years 
rule was addressing a legal education conference sponsored by 
the american law institute and the american bar association

the socialist labor party hailed its strong 
showing in municipal elections friday as a national rejection of 
conservative prime minister margaret thatchers rightwing program 
and its shakeup of the welfare system 
theres a sea change in british politics theres a direct 
rejection of what the tories are doing labor leader neil kinnock 
declared surrounded by jubilant party workers 
labor overtook the conservatives but the tories tightened their 
hold in the prosperous south the two major parties captured 
control of seven councils each where no party previously had 
overall control 
very encouraging very encouraging we got many councils 
mrs thatcher told reporters outside her 10 downing st office 
the major loser was the centrist social and liberal democratic 
party which lost support to the two big parties as it paid for 
internal fueding that followed mrs thatchers third successive 
victory last june 
it was formed in march to merge the centrist liberal party and 
social democratic party but a breakaway faction remained as a 
separate party 
with results in from all 211 local authorities contested labor 
gained 104 seats for a total of 1898 the british domestic news 
agency press association calculated the conservatives had a net 
gain of five seats for 1135 the centrists lost 75 to end up with 
365 seats 
david steel the centrist partys coleader acknowledged it 
is bad not good 
but it was not a disaster considering the appalling year it 
has been for us i am relieved considering our internal 
difficulties he added 
the conservatives now control 48 of the contested cities and 
towns compared with 41 previously labor has 93 up from 91 and 
centrists retained six the scottish nationalists control one 
district while the rest belong to independents or have no party 
with overall control 
labor retained control of major prizes including birmingham 
britains second largest city and the scottish capital edinburgh 
but labor lost control of bradford a key northern industrial 
city where no party now has an overall majority 
no elections were held this year in london and northern ireland 
the local elections were fought on national issues as mrs 
thatcher presses on with sweeping changes in welfare and education 
and a controversial new property tax 
the conservative leader having tamed labor unions and curbed 
inflation since winning power in 1979 sees the changes as part of 
her drive to bury socialism in britain increase personal 
responsibility and end the dependency culture of the welfare 
state 
critics including some uneasy tory rankandfile legislators 
have criticized the changes for bearing unfairly on the poor 
environment secretary nicholas ridley said the results were a 
remarkable achievement for a government pushing through major 
changes 
it has been a pretty difficult patch we are holding up 
he said 
the conservatives who lost all but 10 of the 72 scottish 
parliamentary seats in last junes election again failed to dent 
the deeprooted hostility to the thatcher administration north of 
the border 
unofficial estimates by the british new agency show an average 
voter turnout of about 40 percent the figure is normal for 
municipal elections which always register lower turnouts than 
general elections 
the scottish national party reported the turnout in scotlands 
53 districts was 48 percent compared with 44 percent four years 
ago when these seats were last contested

palestinian factions battled for control 
of beiruts refugee camps friday and rival shiite moslem militias 
fought each other in the slums around them police said 28 people 
were killed and 90 wounded 
ambulances raced through the streets of moslem west beirut the 
american university hospital said its emergency wards were filled 
police said 16 people were killed and 50 wounded in the shiite 
slums where the fight was between the proiranian hezbollah or 
party of god and the mainstream amal militia allied with syria 
the lebanese red cross said its volunteers took at least 23 
wounded from the slums to hospitals in west beirut which is 
policed by the syrian army 
dozens of other bleeding fighters lay on the streets a red 
cross official said we could not help them because of the 
intensity of sniping 
twelve combatants were killed and 40 wounded in the chatilla and 
bourj elbarajneh refugee camps police reported the struggle 
there involves plo chief yasser arafats fatah guerrillas and saeed 
mousas syrianbacked group fatahuprising 
both intramural wars began before dawn and continued into the 
night despite repeated calls for ceasefires mortar rocket and 
smallarms fire could be heard through the city 
the amalhezbollah confrontation began with the overnight ambush 
of an amal patrol in which four amal militamen were killed 
including three brothers from the prominent nassereddin clan they 
were included in the overall casualty count 
police said gunfire raked their jeep amal blamed hezbollah and 
amal militiamen went into the streets to hunt down hezbollah 
members 
fighting spread through several areas of the southern slums 
including the hezbollah strongholds bir elabed and hay madi and 
the densly populated ghobeiri and haret hreik districts 
it was the heaviest fighting among shiites since a fourday amal 
crackdown on hezbollah in south lebanon last month in which 62 
people were killed and 150 wounded 
hezbollah is irans main ally in lebanon and is believed to be 
an umbrella for extremist factions holding most of the 18 foreign 
hostages in the country 
amals action against hezbollah suggests that syria wants to 
crush irans challenge to its role as the main power broker in 
lebanon where 25000 syrian soldiers are stationed 
syria backs iran in the 7yearold iraniraq war but has been 
angered by iranian efforts to dominate the 12 million lebanese 
shiites the largest sect in a nation torn by 13 years of civil war 
about 7500 syrian troopers have policed west beirut for more 
than a year but have not entered the shite slums 
they did not intervene in the amalhezbollah collision but 
surrounded chatilla and bourj elbarajneh and were seen firing 
heavy machine guns into the two palestinian shantytowns 
we are seeking to warn them to stop their stray fire against 
our positions a syrian officer told reporters near chatillas 
entrance were not intervening 
another said we are neutral syria is against any 
interpalestinian fighting we want the plo to get reunited 
palestinian antagonists pounded each others positions in the 
dusty camp alleys with 82mm and 60mm mortars 106mm recoilless guns 
and rocketpropelled grenades police said 
each side accused the other of starting the fighting 
in baghdad iraq an official of arafats fata the main 
fighting force of the palestine liberation organization had asked 
syria to intervene with fatahuprising to stop the battle 
police said arafat loyalists controlled the eastern sector of 
chatilla and fatahuprising dominated the western half near the 
syrians 
heavy sniping on the camps only clear road made it difficult 
for chatillas 3000 residents to flee amd few tried 
i dont know why they are doing this to us a palestinian 
woman said at her home near the eastern entrance we cant take 
it any more i already lost my husband in the camps war i dont 
want to lose my four children

as the black audi gt rolls to a stop 
a valet in a red vest and black bow tie opens the door gives a 
cheery hello and zips the car away to park it for the driver 
is this a pricey restaurant a swank hotel 
no downtown cedar rapids 
this eastern iowa city with a population of 110000 is giving 
valet parking a threemonth trial run in its congested downtown to 
encourage people to shop and conduct other business there 
no matter what it seemed like we did for downtown development 
we still had that one major pitfall parking mayor don canney 
said 
you think of valet parking at posh restaurants or at hotels 
where parking is not highly visible said canney in this case 
its a service geared to eliminate the hassle of parking ramps or 
meters 
in its first four days the service parked 128 cars from 
cadillacs to yugos 
the cityrun service employs eight valets and two cashiers and 
is offered from 30 minutes before downtown stores open until 30 
minutes after they close monday through saturday four hours 
parking costs 2 
some motorists found it perplexing 
how does this work chris sterner of marion asked an 
attendant friday will you give me enough time to get my stroller 
out of the car 
attendant ira hatter even offered to help 
mrs sterner used the valet parking as she took her 5weekold 
son joey downtown to show him off to coworkers 
when im not on maternity leave i park downtown every day 
she said let somebody else deal with it today 
parking cashier chris elliott said the service was believed to 
be only the second in the country for downtown shoppers the other 
is in anaheim calif he said 
i think that generally people still like to be pampered

strict sentencing guidelines imposed in 
november for federal crimes have been ruled unconstitutional by a 
panel of us district court judges in californias central 
district 
the federal judges voted 1410 thursday to reject the guidlines 
imposed by the us sentencing commission a sevenmember group 
formed by congress 
federal judges in maryland also have declared the guidelines 
unconstitutional individual judges elsewhere have disagreed on 
whether to implement the rules 
the department of justice wants to take this up to the supreme 
court on an expedited basis said assistant us attorney james 
berliner we look forward to a prompt resolution by that court 
the guidelines set up a prescribed range of penalties based on 
the severity of the crime and the defendants background although 
designed to make federal sentencing more uniform some jurists say 
they unfairly restrict a judges ability to select the best 
sentence in individual cases 
the decision here affects 32 federal judges working in the 
sevencounty central district which extends from san luis obispo 
to san clemente 
the majority opinion written by judge a andrew hauk attacked 
the constitutionality of the guidelines in two areas 
he wrote that the sentencing restrictions violate a defendants 
right to due process by barring judges from their traditional and 
fundamental ability to exercise discretion 
they also violate constitutional separation of powers among the 
three branches of government because three federal judges serve on 
the sentencing commission formed by congress hauk wrote

pursue the matter i just wanted to bring the issue up and call 
it to everyones attention he said

a police officer was shot in the face with his own 
gun friday during a struggle with a burglary suspect outside a pawn 
shop officials said 
steven lhuillier 28 a sixyear veteran and 1983 rookie of the 
year was in serious but stable condition after surgery at 
methodist medical center spokeswoman brenda vrana said 
police said lhuillier was shot in the cheek with his 
45caliber gun and the bullet lodged in his jaw 
a 20yearold man arrested near the scene was being questioned 
although no charges have been filed police spokesman ed spencer 
said 
police said the suspect is a parolee released from the state 
prison in march after serving 18 months on a fiveyear sentence for 
theft spencer said the man faces charges of attempted capital 
murder and burglary 
the incident began when lhuillier and his partner responded to 
a burglary call early friday at weldons pawn shop 
the two officers split up and walked to different sides of the 
building 
investigator hollis edwards said lhuillier surprised a suspect 
he struggled with the suspect and the suspect gained access to 
his weapon edwards said 
a shot was fired and his partner found lhuillier kneeling on 
the ground wounded police said the suspect fled with the 
revolver which was recovered later from the back of pickup truck

americans took out 446 billion more in 
installment credit than they paid off in march the fourth 
consecutive strong monthly increase the government said friday in 
a report that provided more evidence or strong consumer spending 
the march gain in consumer debt was down from a 504 billion 
increase in february but still represented an annual rate of gain 
of 86 percent the federal reserve said 
for the first three months of the year consumer borrowing 
increased at a 103 percent annual rate compared with 72 percent 
all of last year 
however analysts said rising interest rates and weak wage 
increases likely would slow consumer borrowing in the months ahead 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group a washington 
forecasting firm attributed the growth to strong preeaster 
spending in march and to relatively high level of auto sales 
the credit report said car loans increased 321 billion in 
march a 141 percent annual growth rate compared with a 145 
percent rate in february 
the category which includes credit card debt grew 222 billion 
a strong 163 percent growth rate which followed a gain at a 103 
percent rate in february 
the growth was offset by declines in borrowing to purchase 
mobile homes and in the category including loans from banks and 
credit unions not secured by real estate 
nonreal estate loans fell by 796 million a drop at a 54 
percent annual rate after rising at a 34 percent rate in february 
and a 60 percent rate in january 
ms shaber said the evidence of strong consumer spending in 
march coupled with a drop in the civilian unemployment rate in 
april to 54 percent the lowest since 1974 may increase fears 
that inflation will heat up 
however she said she expected growth in consumer spending to 
slow in the months ahead because salary and wage increases have 
been weak 
my feeling is people will overstate what this means car 
sales weakened a bit in april and department store sales were 
terrible she said 
consumer credit is not going to be growing in the months ahead 
as it did in the first quarter a lot people are working but 
on a perworker basis wages and salaries are not keeping up with 
inflation 
she said consumer spending which accounts for about twothirds 
of the nations economy would likely grow by 2 percent this year 
similar to the 19 percent growth last year but only about half of 
the growth rate earlier in the expansion 
analysts say rising interest rates by boosting the cost of 
credit purchases are likely to dampen spending 
the federal home loan mortgage corp said friday that fixedrate 
mortgages rose in the current week to 1032 percent up from 1028 
percent a week earlier

pravda heaped praise on one of chinas 14 open 
economic zones friday and suggested that the soviet union needs a 
rebirth of working spirit to bring similar prosperity 
the authors of the article on chinas tianjin region did not 
draw direct lessons from it but recited the accomplishments in the 
open zones and said the success of chinese perestroika was due 
to an inspired work force 
perestroika is the name soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev gives 
his plans for economic and social reform in the soviet union 
gorbachev has referred to the chinese economic experiments 
favorably but the article in the communist party newspaper was the 
most complimentary to date about developments in the neighboring 
communist country 
soviet supporters of perestroika which means restructuring 
have encouraged broader use of joint ventures to attract foreign 
investment 
many problems face foreign business executives in the soviet 
union however including low worker productivity unreliable 
delivery of supplies poor storage and transportation facilities 
and poor hotels and living accommodations 
the fact that the ruble is nonconvertible not traded on world 
currency markets complicates joint ventures and has reduced the 
number the soviets have been able to negotiate 
chinas 14 open economic zones contain only 8 percent of the 
nations 1 billion people but account for more than onequarter of 
industrial production and 40 percent of exports pravda said the 
paper noted that they were established only four years ago 
its report was the second this week praising chinas economic 
policies in the government newspaper izvestia on tuesday writer 
chingiz aitmatov criticized soviet agriculture and pointed to a 
chinese move away from large collectives toward family farming 
pravda raised the question whether chinese perestroika had 
succeeded at the expense of workers and answered that it had not 
pay in the open zones averages 50 percent more than for similar 
jobs in other parts of the country the newspaper said but greater 
productivity makes labor costs lower 
chinas special economic zones have attracted foreign capital 
and joint ventures because the chinese built the necessary support 
facilities pravda said 
in the tianjin region buildings literally pop up like a 
mirage in the desert it said and developers built luxury 
hotels a golf course sports clubs and other services that make 
western business executives feel comfortable while in the area to 
oversee their enterprises 
transport problems were worked out ahead of time to ensure 
enough shipping capacity and a lenient tax system has drawn more 
foreign investment each year the newspaper said 
pravda said the tianjin region alone had 80 contracts for joint 
ventures and more than 100 million was invested there in 1987

an overseer of congressional buildings said 
friday that the structures exceed federal safety standards but a 
fire chiefturnedcongressman said a blaze in house speaker jim 
wrights office demonstrates the need for improvement 
the federal government should accept no fire standards less 
than they require of private businesses downtown said rep curt 
weldon rpa whose office is next to wrights in the longworth 
house office building 
weldon a former volunteer fire chief in suburban philadelphia 
said the fire thursday was able to rage unimpeded for 10 minutes 
because the building opened in 1933 lacked fire hoses and alarms 
elliott carroll executive assistant to capitol architect george 
c white contended that congressional office buildings are as 
safe as any place in the world and that the damage to wrights 
office was minor 
still carroll told reporters a 475 million modernization 
project is under way to make the congressional offices safer voice 
fire alarms and smoke detectors will be put in the buildings but 
there will be no new sprinkler systems installed he said 
and the monumental space those with extensive historic 
value will not be touched he said 
carroll said congressional buildings meet and exceed the 
building officials conference of america code which is described 
as the national standard 
all these buildings are fireproof said carroll they all 
are made out of brick and stone the solidness of the buildings can 
be shown by the fact that the fire was contained in one room 
carroll said the fire started in a copying machine located in a 
kitchenette in wrights secondfloor office and was confined to 
that room two other rooms received smoke and water damage he said 
he placed the damage estimate at 10000 the district of 
columbia fire epartment had estimated thursday night that the fire 
caused 120000 in damage but carroll said the lower figure was 
more accurate because repairs would be done by congressional 
employees 
had there been hoses in the hallway weldon said we could 
have put the fire out with little damage i was told that the dc 
fire department recommended that the inchandahalf hoses be 
removed because they sometimes deteriorate thats what inspections 
are for 
capt ted holmes spokesman for the dc fire department ken 
butters president of the international association of fire chiefs 
and carroll said the hoses were removed because fire departments 
wont use them 
you have to be aware that the dc fire department does not 
use any of those hoses because of deterioration and the water 
pressure would splinter them holmes said 
carroll said the capitol and congressional office buildings are 
exempt from localfire code laws not by law but because all federal 
buildings are exempt from them 
butters explained that this was the case because it would be too 
difficult to write regulations to cover the entire nation just 
about every local community writes its own code which usually is 
more stringent than state or county codes he said for instance 
he said it is not unusual for state universities to be exempt from 
local codes 
carroll said the capitol the six congressional office 
buildings the three library of congress buildings and the supreme 
court were all in compliance with local laws and this is 
important at the time they were built there is no requirement to 
bring them up to higher standards 
holmes said the district of columbia uses the building 
officials association but he declined to say whether the 
buildings are now in compliance with the citys regulations that 
would be speculation on our part because we dont inspect them 
he said 
holmes said the newer structures such as the senates hart and 
dirksen buildings the houses rayburn building the librarys 
madison building and the supreme court have stateoftheart 
equipment 
the longworth and cannon house buildings and the librarys 
jefferson and adams are currently being worked on some work has 
been done on the capitol and the senate russell buildings

hisses and cheers rose from the gallery of the 
house of commons on friday after a bill that would have restricted 
the right to abortion was defeated by delay tactics 
the measure would have been the first change in the law since 
britain legalized abortion in 1967 it would have barred abortions 
after the 17th week of pregnancy instead of the 28th week as the 
current law allows 
conservative john wakeham the house leader rejected a final 
appeal for the government to provide extra time to secure passage 
of the bill 
during a heated debate a spectator was ejected from the gallery 
after shouting an expletive at a legislator who argued against 
passage 
conservative sir bernard braine denounced what he called the 
scandal of late abortions for social or convenience reasons 
im talking about the right of life of the unborn he said 
we should remember that the unborn child marked down for abortion 
has no choice at all 
jo richardson a prominent feminist member of the opposition 
labor party accused supporters of taking an absolutist and 
fundamentalist view of abortion 
they are willing to barter with womens bodies and gamble with 
childrens lives to try to maximize support for this bill and 
inflict a substantial blow on the 1967 act which has given women 
and doctors 20 years of safe legal abortions she said 
procedural wrangling left no time for a vote on whether the bill 
should proceed to a final debate and vote in the house of commons 
britain by allowing abortions at up to 28 weeks or about seven 
months of pregnancy has one of the western worlds most liberal 
abortion laws in the united states abortions are allowed without 
regulation in the first three months of pregnancy 
after that some state regulation is allowed 
supporters of the new law argued that abortions should not be 
allowed when a fetus might have a reasonable chance to survive 
outside the womb at 24 weeks such survival is rare but survival 
at 28 weeks is estimated at 74 percent in optimal conditions the 
usual length of pregnancy is 40 weeks 
of the 172286 abortions in england and wales in 1986 the 
latest year for which statistics are available 10770 or 6 
percent were done after 17 weeks according to the department of 
health and social security 
opponents of the bill contended that an 18week limit would deny 
women the choice of abortion because of a fetal handicap since it 
might not be possible to detect the handicap at such an early stage 
of pregnancy 
fourteen previous attempts to amend the 1967 abortion act have 
failed but parliaments antiabortion lobby had gained widespread 
bipartisan support for the latest bill 
in january the commons approved the bill by a majority of 296 
to 251 at a crucial parliamentary stage leading to speculation 
that it might be approved albeit in a watereddown form 
the medical profession and the government of prime minister 
margaret thatcher had supported a fourweek reduction in the time 
limit to 24 weeks by withholding government support for an 
18week cutoff mrs thatcher had significantly lowered its chances 
of passage but left open the possibility of a compromise 
the bills sponsor david alton of the social and liberal 
democratic party has said he would mount another attempt to 
tighten the abortion law if his bill failed

proiranian moslems holding foreigners hostage in 
lebanon often degraded their captives and took everything away 
from us even our first names a freed french hostage was quoted 
as saying friday 
jeanpaul kauffmann one of three french hostages released 
thursday said one jailer carried out a terrifying mock execution 
as everywhere else i imagine some of our jailers were very 
human but in a very hard context kauffmann was quoted as saying 
by agence francepresse 
there was an abu hassan who didnt speak a word of french but 
who was attentive obliging always in a good humor which was not 
the case with many of his fellows very unstable sometimes 
perverse most of them were not able to maintain a constant 
attitude the best alternated with the worst for reasons that 
escaped us 
another of his guards whom kauffmann identified as abu ali was 
particularly cruel 
he left us in filth because for him we were impure said 
kauffmann a reporter for the weekly evenement du jeudi who was 
abducted may 22 1985 he continued to humiliate us not to 
mention a mock execution in june 1987 which was particularly 
frightening 
the first year and above all the first weeks were the most 
difficult kauffmann was quoted as saying because it took some 
time for me to become accustomed to being a prisoner 
they tried to degrade us they took everything away from us 
even our first names he said the kidnappers gave each of the 
three french hostages a new name habib for marcel carton najib 
for marcel fontaine and labib for kauffmann 
the journalist said he was moved 18 times in his nearly three 
years of captivity his worst memory apart from the death of 
fellow french hostage michel seurat was in the beginning of 1987 
when the syrians entered west beirut 
he said he was bound with cloth strips like a mummy and placed 
in a sort of coffin under the bed of a truck 
before leaving we had to swear to be silent each time the 
vehicle stopped or we would be executed kauffmann was quoted as 
telling afp 
after each move the hostages had to renegotiate even the 
smallest privileges he was quoted as saying 
the smallest change had a considerable affect on our existence 
and our morale a cup of coffee was a real festival

twentyfive states asked a federal appeals 
court friday to review a new transportation department regulation 
concerning air fare advertising that they contend undercuts state 
consumerprotection laws 
the petition for review filed with the us circuit court of 
appeals here said the march 10 order allowing airlines to advertise 
air fares without including taxes fees and other surcharges in the 
total price conflicts with the states interpretation of their 
own consumer protection statutes 
the order will undercut the protections provided to consumers 
to know the total price of air transportation the petition said 
the states contended that the total advertised price should 
include foreign departure taxes customs fees immigration fees 
security fees and other charges imposed by government agencies 
each of the states interprets its consumer protection statutes 
that it is a deceptive practice for airlines to advertise a price 
to be paid by a consumer for air transportation without disclosing 
the total price to be paid for the air transportation the 
petition said 
the transportation department order allows the airlines to 
advertise the air fare at the top of ads without including the fees 
in the total price provided that the fees are mentioned in 
legible readable type at the bottom of the ad 
the petition was filed by the states of alaska arkansas 
california colorado connecticut indiana kansas maine 
maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota missouri montana

jesse jackson declared friday that 
california has the power to determine the next nominee of our 
party and urged voters to ignore those who say the democratic 
race is locked up 
california here we are he told a sunsoaked rally at santa 
monica community college 
earlier in a dramatic speech to a high school rally jackson 
spoke against gang violence stating i challenge you because i 
love you because i care because im not scared of you 
when i become president im going to break it up he said 
of the gang warfare 
referring to a rash of gang killings in the los angeles area 
jackson said you who are so precious who are so dear are 
living beneath your privilege 
some of the 3000 fremont high school youths in the athletic 
field bleachers were wearing gang colors 
starting his campaign day at a labor breakfast jackson said the 
race is still tight despite the wide delegate lead enjoyed by his 
rival michael dukakis 
speaking in a state with substantial dependence on military 
contracts jackson also proposed nonmilitary development of space 
as a way to recover defense industry jobs that would be lost under 
his proposed military budget freeze 
he declined to give specifics when asked by reporters how many 
jobs could be created in space development or how much spending he 
proposed 
with dukakis holding nearly a 600delegate lead jackson also 
continued to call for party officials to ensure a reasonable 
correlation between the primary popular vote which stands at 37 
percent to 28 percent against him and the delegate count there 
are 314 delegates at stake in californias primary on june 7 
this race is a close race but its about directions he 
told more than 400 unionists at a los angeles county federation of 
labor breakfast 
the press the pundits the party the candidate its not 
just me and him its me and them he said 
after the speech jackson told reporters he does not consider 
his call for fairness at all divisive 
but he said the party establishment super delegates should 
wait until after the primary season ends before committing to a 
candidate so they can help offset any imbalances in places where 
the delegate count is not directly proportional to the popular vote 
on another subject he was asked by reporters what he sees as 
dukakis weaknesses in the battle for calfornias delegates 
jackson referred to what he said were state budget problems in 
massachusetts and said dukakis as governor was cutting programs for 
pregnant teens and for elderly people to make up revenue 
voters should consider he said as we look toward 1989 on 
whose backs will we balance the budget 
the most dramatic event of jacksons campaign day came after his 
speech at fremont high school in san pedro about 300 students came 
down from the bleachers admitted they used drugs and said they 
would try not to any more 
if youve tried drugs and you want to get well come on down 
he said let them through the gate our children want to get 
well jackson told security officers at the fence separating his 
stage from the bleachers 
he had the teenagers raise their hands and repeat the words 
i can be and will be a better person 
afterward stanley chaney 18 who said he had tried drugs once 
said it was an experience for everybody 
it helped a lot it makes you realize youre not by 
yourself said gina brooks 17 who said she drank alcohol but 
was not a drug user 
one boy who disavowed drug use said he came down on the field 
because i just wanted to see him

children who receive hormones to help them 
grow may face a slightly higher risk of developing leukemia but 
the increased risk even if proven is not great enough to 
warrant withholding treatment scientists said friday 
cancer and growth experts from several countries met this week 
to review 15 cases of leukemia worldwide in patients treated with 
synthetic growth hormones the meetings were prompted by reports of 
leukemia in five japanese children who had received the treatment 
there is no therapy that is riskfree said a statement by 
the lawson wilkins pediatric endocrine society which represents 
doctors and scientists working in the field because gh therapy 
is essential for optimal growth and development in gh deficient 
children it would be inappropriate and unwise to withhold such 
treatment from needy patients 
the group said it has not been proven that there is an increased 
risk and patients can be told that if there is one it is small 
the incidence of leukemia among patients taking growth hormone 
worldwide is estimated at 1 in 21000 patientyears of treatment 
the society said while a reasonable estimate of the risk among 
nonpatients in the same age range is 1 in 42000 
among the 15 cases examined four were deemed not to have been 
caused by the treatment because they either occurred within two or 
three months of treatment or there were compelling reasons to 
suspect other causes the group said 
the society said that if there is a relationship between growth 
hormone treatment and leukemia the cause could be the effect of the 
hormone on bone marrow cells a contaminant in hormone 
preparations or the combined effect of the hormone and genetic or 
environmental factors in certain patients 
the human growth foundation which is supported by 1000 
families with children having growth disorders participated in the 
meetings that examined the cases experts came from the united 
states canada japan australia and several european countries 
the foundation had no figures immediately available on the 
number of children currently receiving treatment 
manufacturers of growth hormones estimate that about 2 million 
us children are in the lowest 2 percentile by height meaning 
they are shorter than 98 percent of children their age

president reagan assured a concerned west 
german official friday that us commitment to bonn and the nato 
alliance remains unshaken the white house said 
reagan also told dr alfred dregger that usgerman 
cooperation is the cornerstone of the nato alliance presidential 
spokesman roman popadiuk said 
dregger is chairman of chancellor helmut kohls majority faction 
in the bundestag parliament he said he was satisfied and 
relieved by assurances from reagan and other us leaders that 
nuclear disarmament will not be allowed to break the strategic 
unity of the north atlantic treaty organization 
urging the united states and the west to seize the intiative as 
soon as possible in negotiating with the soviet union a reduction 
of nonnuclear weapons in europe dregger also told reagan that 
bonn would cooperate fully in maintaining natos strategy of 
flexible response popadiuk said 
reagan told the west german that us commitment to germany 
and western europe is unshakeable popadiuk said 
i am very satisfied with my sessions in washington and i am 
convinced that the alliance will guarantee the security of the 
german federal republic and europe for another 40 years 
dregger told reporters afterward 
dregger said defense secretary frank c carlucci and arms 
control adviser paul nitze had confirmed to him that we will 
continue to have unbroken unity of deterrence and risksharing 
between north america and europe that the entire alliance will 
remain a strategic unity 
dregger said he also confirmed in his talks that sealaunched 
cruise missiles and airborne nuclear weapons of medium range would 
remain after the dismantling of landbased intermediate systems 
under the treaty signed by reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev at the washington summit last december 
therefore we will still have mediumrange missiles which 
constitute a link between the strategic systems and the shortrange 
systems in europe dregger said 
the bundestag defense expert said in a thursday speech his 
christiandemocratic party would go along with plans for 
modernizing shortrange tactical nuclear weapons so long as 
risksharing and deterrence sharing with respect to 
intermediaterange weapons is maintained this is because 
denuclearization of europe would give full effect to the soviet 
unions huge conventional and chemical superiority he said 
the pentagon agreed with this but reacted sharply to dreggers 
statement that germans want to pursue the question of whether 
nuclear artillery is necessary and expedient dresser said this 
should be covered in a comprehensive review of nuclear strategy for 
disarmament ordered at the last nato summit 
when the issue of shortrange nuclear weapons those with ranges 
of less than 300 miles was raised with reagan the president said 
their reduction would be discussed only after eastwest balance is 
achieved in conventional nonatomic weapons popadiuk said 
dregger said the purpose of nuclear artillery can only be a 
limited one such as to prevent the concentration of 
conventional assault forces especially tank armies it should 
not be relied on for a deterrent he said because the range is too 
short to target eastward to soviet territory he said 
but the pentagon said friday that modern nuclear artillery 
rounds are an integral element of the minimumlevel credible 
nuclear deterrent posture approved in natos 1983 decision at 
montebello canada and revalidated last month by the alliances 
defense ministers 
their elimination would have a number of adverse effects on 
nato flexible response strategy the pentagon said starting with 
reducing soviet uncertainty as to when where and how nato would 
respond to an attack 
dregger said the greater the range of a modernized version of 
the lance missile with a current range of 70 miles the less will 
be the need for nuclear artillery rounds but the pentagon declared 
that both a followon to lance and continued modernization of 
nuclear artillery are necessary to keep natos nuclear deterrent 
up to date

the maker of the aids drug retrovir citing 
studies that the drug shows promise as a preventive treatment in 
animal experiments is launching a study to find out if the drug 
can prevent infection in health workers exposed to the aids virus 
there is some previous work in animal models of retroviral 
infection which indicates that administration of retrovir if begun 
within a few days of viral exposure and continued for only a few 
weeks may prevent the establishment of retroviral infection or 
significantly alter disease progression said dr sandra 
nusinofflehrman associate head of the infectious diseases 
department at burroughs wellcome 
this is the first study by burroughs wellcome the only 
pharmaceutical company that makes retrovir to determine the drugs 
ability to prevent hiv infection company spokeswoman kathy 
bartlett said thursday 
retrovir formerly known as azt is the only drug that has 
received federal approval as an effective treatment against the 
human immunodeficiency virus there is currently no therapy proved 
to prevent infection upon exposure to the aids virus 
health care workers who treat patients with aids and 
accidentally come in direct contact with blood products infected 
with hiv will be given retrovir shortly after the exposure ms 
bartlett said 
burroughs wellcome will examine how well patients tolerate the 
drug ms bartlett said the same dose recommended for treatment of 
aids patients will be administered to health care workers 
retrovir has been found to cause nausea insomnia muscle pains 
and bone marrow suppression in hivinfected patients taking the 
drug the relatively brief period of retrovir therapy is likely to 
produce few significant side effects in healthy individuals dr 
lehrman said 
company officials said it is too early to determine whether the 
drug could be used to prevent infection among individuals in 
highrisk groups who think they have been exposed to the virus 
the major cause of transmission in the health care industry is 
accidentally puncturing the skin with a needle or other sharp 
instrument contaminated with infected blood said dr wayne 
thomann director of environmental safety and hospital epidemiology 
at duke university medical center 
contact with the hiv virus doesnt necessarily mean a person 
will become infected however studies show the chance of a health 
care worker being infected with the aids virus is 1 in 200 ms 
bartlett said

secretary of state george p shultz is gearing 
up for a trip to the middle east in june in another effort to 
promote arabisraeli peace talks a us official said friday 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said a final 
decision to make the trip is likely next week shultz would make 
stops in israel egypt jordan and syria hoping to open 
negotiations over palestinian selfrule and then on an overall 
mideast settlement 
he would fly to the middle east at the windup of the moscow 
summit meeting june 2 and then attend a meeting of the north 
atlantic treaty organizations foreign ministers in madrid june 
910 the official said 
two trips by shultz to the middle east this year failed to 
produce peace talks but the secretary refuses to give up whos 
afraid to struggle against odds he said at the end of the last 
venture in april what am i saving myself for anyway 
he also suggested that arabs and israelis despite their public 
lack of enthusiasm for negotiations had privately urged him to 
keep trying 
shultzs first goal is a peace conference that would sponsor 
but not steer negotiations to provide some form of selfrule for 
the 15 million palestinian arabs who live on the israeliheld west 
bank and in gaza 
the secretary told a senate appropriations subcommittee last 
week that under the right circumstances king hussein of jordan 
would be agreeable however he also testified that israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir had made the conference the centerpiece 
of his objections to shultzs plan 
shultz also was unsuccessful last month in moscow in trying to 
persuade the soviet union to accept a limited role in the 
negotiations 
shamir and shultz are unwilling to give the soviets an 
opportunity to shape the outline of an arabisraeli settlement but 
hussein is insisting on soviet involvement 
on the other hand jordan is resisting negotiations with israel 
without a guarantee that it would recover all the land it lost 
during the 1967 mideast war shultz has advised hussein that was 
not in the cards but he backs the idea of israel trading some 
territory on the west bank for peace and said the future of 
jerusalem should be decided in negotiations 
despite the long odds shultz said he did not think his plan was 
fated to failure 
shultzs plan called for a peace conference in midapril the 
opening of negotations on the palestinians may 1 and a second stage 
of talks on an overall settlement beginning dec 1 
the first two deadlines have passed still shultz has said he 
will keep trying to get negotiations started in the 8 months that 
remain to the reagan administration in order to give the next 
president a head start

the new head of the us chamber of commerce 
said friday hefty pay raises for corporate executives should 
inspire rankandfile workers to be ambitious rather than envious 
william s kanaga the 19881989 chairman of the board of 
directors of the us chamber of commerce was asked by reporters 
at a luncheon what he thought of the fact that management salaries 
have been increasing at a faster rate than the pay of lowerranking 
workers 
he replied that he was reminded of a story told by walt frazier 
a former star for the new york knicks basketball team 
frazier was asked what are you doing for the black race 
he replied i drive my rolls royce through harlem every sunday 
and if that wont motivate them i dont know what will kanaga 
said 
asked if it was healthy for executives figuratively speaking 
to flaunt their rolls royces in front of workers he said one of 
the beauties of the free enterprise system we have is if a fellow 
wants to go down a certain avenue he can make a lot of money 
he said fraziers rolls royce may have driven some fellows 
back to the basketball courts up there 
kanaga who is chairman of the advisory board of arthur young amp 
co an accounting firm was asked if he believed athletics were 
the only route out of the ghetto for young blacks 
im not suggesting it is the only one no there are others 
he replied mentioning education 
the value of incentives he said is illustrated by the supply 
of taxicabs in beijing before and after economic reforms in china 
before the reforms taxis were nearly impossible to find at dinner 
time because drivers were paid a flat monthly salary now that the 
drivers get to keep a part of the fare cabs are plentiful he said 
kanaga also said that higher managerial salary hikes when a 
company succeeds must be balanced against the possibility that they 
will be out of the job if their companys fortunes take a downturn 
he said chrysler corp workers are probably delighted even 
though they earned far less than chrysler chairman lee iacocca 
because of iacoccas leadership in saving the company

a fire that gutted four stories of 
californias tallest skyscraper killing one person and injuring 
40 could have been prevented if city council had done its duty 14 
years ago a lawmaker charged friday 
meanwhile first interstate bancorp officials discounted 
speculation of arson prompted by fears of impending layoffs city 
fire officials had yet to determine the cause of the blaze at the 
62story first interstate bank tower 
councilman nate holden introduced a motion friday to require all 
highrises to install sprinkler systems a similar law that took 
effect in 1974 did not apply to structures built before then the 
bank was built in 1973 
workers were installing a sprinkler system in the 859foot 
skyscraper when the fire the worst highrise blaze in los angeles 
history erupted late wednesday 
if you had done your duty in 1974 we wouldnt be here 
today charged holden who was elected last year 
the motion was given little discussion because it was not on the 
agenda it was put on tuesdays agenda 
city officials said as many as twothirds of the citys 765 
skyscrapers lack sprinklers that could prevent fire catastophes 
a first interstate spokesman discounted arson speculation 
prompted by news that the companys capital markets group was sold 
in a deal that closed wednesday night the group employs 100 people 
on the floor where the fire apparently broke out 
spokesman john popovich said the sale was consummated after the 
close of business and kept secret from workers until thursday 
morning after the fire further the bank had announced its 
intention to sell the group which buys and sells government bonds 
in october 
i firmly believe that at this stage its random chance 
popovich said of the timing of the sale and fire if the idea is 
that there is a disgruntled employee that would have been six 
months ago 
printon kane amp co of short hills nj which bought the group 
for 40 million plans no layoffs or moves said robert grimmig 
managing partner of the firm 
the blaze that gutted the 12th through 15th stories and damaged 
part of the 16th floor of the skyscraper causing 450 million in 
damage a maintenance engineer was killed and 40 people were 
injured 
agents from the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
were also investigating 
consumer services including checking savings and automatic 
teller machines in the 19 states where first interstate does 
business continued except at the tower branch 
securities trading and electronic funds transfers from other 
institutions continued smoothly largely because the bank had 
recently developed an emergency plan for use in an earthquake

american and british convoys sailed 
parallel courses down the persian gulf on friday with helicopters 
scouting ahead for mines 
observers who saw the two convoys 30 miles off dubai at midday 
said the british group was made up of five tankers escorted by the 
royal navys 4100ton destroyer gloucester 
associated press photographer greg english said the american 
guidedmissile frigate jack williams was escorting the usflag 
79999ton kuwaiti products tankers chesapeake city and ocean city 
and had picked up a hitchhiker the liberianflagged tanker 
neston 
other ships often follow those protected by warships through the 
strait of hormuz the narrow gateway to the gulf where iranian 
gunboats often attack unescorted ships a total of about 500 ships 
have been attacked by iran and iraq since the countries went to war 
in september 1980 
the us convoy was the 29th of this year and the fourth in a 
week the convoys were disrupted last month by a confrontation 
april 18 between us and iranian forces in which two iranian oil 
platforms and six naval craft were destroyed or damaged 
gulfbased shipping executives and pentagon officials in 
washington all speaking on condition they not be named reported 
earlier that irans fleet of armed speedboats was increasing in 
size and activity around the hormuz naval base at bandar abbas but 
the reason was not known 
iran has said it will avenge its losses and adm william j 
crowe jr chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff said during 
a visit to the region that the threat could not be dimissed 
officers on the 3700ton jack williams were said to be more 
concerned about mines than the reports of armed speedboats the 
williams played a key role in the usiran clash and was one of 
three us ships that came under iranian missile fire near hormuz 
it could be anything who knows what theyre up to one 
officer said according to a report filed from the ship by a 
pentagon news media pool 
lookouts posted on the frigates bow scanned the waters with 
binoculars looking for floaters as the helicopters searched 
farther ahead submerged mines sometimes can be seen from the air 
last month the jack williams passed unscathed through an area 
of the central gulf less than a day before its sister frigate 
samuel b roberts sailed into a field of newly laid mines and hit 
one ten crewmen were wounded 
fridays convoy was the first to negotiate the 110mile hormuz 
passage since washington announced a new policy that allows us 
warships to intervene in iranian attacks on commercial ships 
bearing other flags 
the policy applies to any ship in international waters and not 
carrying warrelated cargo for iraq or iran previously us 
warships could defend only vessels flying the american flag 
since the us navy began escorting reflagged kuwaiti tankers 
last july none of the 51 convoys has been molested by irans 
surface raiders 
iran condemned the new us policy as aggression and 
promised to continue raids on shipping

the october stock market crash headed higher in april the 
government said friday 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates savings 
institutions said its nationwide average for conventional 30year 
fixedrate mortgages on single family homes rose to 1048 percent 
in early april up from 1033 percent in march 
it was the first increase in the bank boards monthly average 
since october interest rates began falling after the stock market 
crash as the federal reserve board pumped money into the economy to 
guard against a recession 
market analysts believe the fed tightened the money supply in 
march pushing rates higher as it shifted its emphasis from 
recessionfighting to dampening fears of inflation 
the bank board survey said rates for the most popular type of 
oneyear adjustablerate mortgages those with limits on how much 
the rate can increase dropped slightly from 864 percent in march 
to 862 percent in april 
it was the first time in six months that the spread between 
rates for the two types of mortgages has widened however the 
april margin of 186 percent was still much smaller than the record 
242 percent gap in october 
interest rates are on the rise once again particularly for 
fixedrate mortgages said warren lasko executive vice president 
of the mortgage bankers association of america this reflects a 
general uptrend over the past few weeks in the bond markets and 
renewed fears of inflation 
the bank board numbers really reflect the world of a month ago 
and since then rates have gone still higher he said adding that 
the april unemployment report showing the jobless rate dropping to 
54 percent for the first time since 1974 will fan inflation fears 
and is only going to make things worse 
however lasko said we dont think this rise in rates will 
throttle homebuying if anything it will cause people to buy 
sooner to take advantage of rates while they are still attractive 
according to a separate weekly report by the federal home loan 
mortgage corp 30year fixedterm rates rose this week to 1032 
percent up from 1028 percent a week ago those averages are lower 
than the bank boards because they do not include addon fees 
known as points which are paid by borrowers 
the bank board also said the share of mortgage loans with 
adjustable rates fell below 50 percent for the first time since 
last july the adjustablerate share which peaked at 69 percent in 
december fell from 54 percent in march to 48 percent in april 
lasko said he expected that trend to reverse as the gap widens 
between fixed and adjustable rates

a brownie troops hopes of sending 
girl scout cookies to us sailors have been snarled in red tape 
because of a halfbaked 2000 japanese import tax slapped on the 
goodies a troop leader said friday 
the 402 boxes of thin mints golden yangles scot ts savannahs 
jubilees classic cremes and hoedowns are piled up at the corpus 
christi international airport while officials try to figure out how 
to get them to their destination 
we thought there would be a small import fee but not this 
much groused marchetta white leader of brownie troop 807 in 
nearby beeville 
the 18 girls in the troop sold the cookies to crew members of 
the uss midway berthed in atsugi japan and were eagerly awaiting 
letters from the servicemen who bought them mrs white said 
american airlines shipped the cookies april 26 to japan without 
charge however when japanese customs officials demanded a 2000 
import tax the boxes sat in a customs warehouse for four days 
before being returned to corpus christi they have been in storage 
in one of the airlines offices this week 
the troops top cookie seller 8yearold nickelle clark said 
she did not like how the plan crumbled 
i dont think its fair she said im mad 
jean titus general manager for the airline in corpus christi 
said it probably will fly the cookies to honolulu where the navy 
will pick them up but it could take several weeks for the shipment 
to arrive 
im quite sure that they will be leaving in the morning she 
added 
iso mura with the department of customs inquiries in the 
japanese embassy in washington said cookies would have a duty 
equal to 24 percent of the items value and its freight costs he 
said the 2000 fee seemed high 
it may be a mistake mura said 
the cookie crisis even got sen lloyd bentsen involved the 
texas democrat has been working through diplomatic channels since 
thursday to get those cookies on the way to the sailors on the 
midway a spokesman said 
us food and drug administration spokesman curtis coker said 
that if the situation were reversed we would let it go right 
through to the japanese in their ship or at their base you have to 
apply a bit of common sense in regulating the food supply 
mrs white said that she chose the midway because her soninlaw 
is stationed on the ship and that the brownies have been 
corresponding with the crew since they sent christmas cards to the 
sailors last year 
girl scout leaders have not told all of the first second and 
thirdgraders that their cookie scheme met an international barrier 
they decided at this point since the cookies are going to get 
to the sailors they didnt want to complicate the brownies 
lives said ann diaz executive director of the paisano girl 
scout council in southern texas 
however some of the girls parents have told them about the 
detained cookies 
some of the younger ones werent real comprehending about what 
happened and the older ones do understand and are a little 
disappointed the guys didnt get their cookies mrs white said 
next time she vowed they will go through the military or the 
mail

damage estimates topped 100 million 
friday from explosions that demolished a rocket fuel plant while 
city officials tried to calm residents by meeting with a 
neighboring company making the same product 
weve created a monster of fear said city councilman 
michael harris i dont think anybody other than maybe some of 
those that really knew the plants knew the potential hazard 
inside 
union officers meanwhile huddled to review safety records of 
pacific engineering and production co where a 1982 union letter 
wondered why the plant hadnt already been blown off the face of 
the earth 
jim barnes state industrial relations director said pacific 
underwent 11 inspections by the state occupational safety and 
health division over the last five years 
the inspections resulted in 10 citations as well as four fines 
for incidents barnes termed serious 
there have been problems from time to time mostly minor he 
said our opinion is that overall there record has been a good 
moderate record 
executives of kerrmcgee corp which manufactures the same 
ammonium perchlorate a mile from the earthquakeforce blast that 
leveled pacific met with city officials amid calls from frightened 
residents to shut the second plant down 
its too early to say were going to run kerrmcgee out of 
town said harris we have to wait and find out what caused 
this it may create a tremendous war out here 
kerrmcgee voluntarily shut down thursday 
we will not resume until were absolutely certain its safe 
said kerrmcgee spokesman paul reed but weve been operating 35 
years without any sort of accident we think our plant safety 
record is exemplary 
two pacific executives were killed and 326 people were treated 
at hospitals for injuries in wednesdays blast which threw houses 
off their foundations and severely damaged buildings throughout the 
city 10 miles southeast of las vegas 
six people remained hospitalized including a 5dayold child 
cut over the eye by flying glass in a hospital nursery 
nearly a third of the citys 16000 homeowners filed damage 
claims by friday city manager gary bloomquist said initial damage 
estimates topped 100 million 
the number of claims already has really startled me said 
bloomquist but things are going real well practically 
everything is running again and people are ordering new windows and 
garage doors 
president reagan was asked on thursday to declare a disaster 
area to qualify the city for federal grants 
john molovich a united steelworkers union safety and health 
expert flew to henderson from pittsburgh to meet with local union 
officials the reports were getting is theyve had problems with 
fires of late said molovich 
molovich wrote a 1982 letter that questioned plant safety after 
he took a tour in the letter he wrote of fears of an explosion 
because of the chemicals used at the plant 
the company moved on some of the items molovich said 
friday im not saying they didnt do anything but they moved on 
the minor things some of the major things were just not being 
done 
this city of about 55000 grew up around an industrial complex 
that began during world war ii with a plant that produced titanium 
for warplanes growth here has been sharp in recent years making 
it the thirdlargest city in nevada 
although pacific has vowed to rebuild the plant within six 
months bloomquist said it had better be someplace else 
we dont have a facility big enough here to hold all the 
protesters if they try and rebuild there he said

the justice department has found that no 
further review is warranted of allegations against attorney general 
edwin meese iii involving the bankruptcy of a computer software 
firm doing business with the department a spokesman said friday 
the department said in a letter that allegations by inslaw 
incs president william hamilton provided no basis for an 
independent counsel to look into the charges the letter was sent 
to charles work hamiltons attorney 
the criminal divisions acting chief john keeney has 
concluded theres no need for an independent counsel to 
investigate this matter said justice department spokesman terry 
eastland 
meese is not under investigation by any section of the 
department with regard to the inslaw matter said a department 
source speaking on condition of anonymity 
among hamiltons allegations was that meese interceded to have 
the companys former attorney leigh ratiner dismissed from the 
washington law firm of dickstein shapiro amp morin hamilton 
contends in court papers that ratiner was asked to leave shortly 
after meese discussed the inslaw case with one of his politically 
connected law partners leonard garment 
garment called the allegation involving meese pure baloney 
but said he was questioned about the allegation two months ago by 
the justice departments public integrity section 
hamilton said he had not yet seen the letter adding that public 
integrity investigators never interviewed him his wife nancy nor 
ratiner 
we are surprised they reached a conclusion without talking to 
either the complaining witnesses or one of the victims hamilton 
said 
under the 1978 ethics in government act allegations must be 
deemed to be specific and credible in order for a matter to be 
referred to an independent counsel 
meese has been under criminal investigation since last may 11 by 
independent counsel james c mckay on other matters mckays office 
had referred the inslaw allegations about meese to the justice 
departments public integrity section to determine if they required 
further investigation if they had merited such further 
investigation the allegations would have been returned to the 
independent counsel 
inslaw won a 68 million judgment against the justice 
department from a federal bankruptcy judge who ruled that officials 
used trickery fraud and deceit to steal software the company 
had developed under a 10 million government contract the justice 
department is appealing the ruling 
the departments public integrity section is conducting an 
investigation of possible perjury by government officials who 
testified last year at a us bankruptcy court proceeding involving 
inslaw according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the perjury investigation stems from a ruling last year by us 
bankruptcy judge george f bason jr that there had been an attempt 
by justice department officials in 1985 to force inslaw into 
liquidation of its assets which would have put the firm out of 
business 
the judge expressed disbelief in testimony given by two former 
bankruptcy trustees and thomas j stanton head of the departments 
executive office of us trustees 
stanton denied that he tried to pressure the trustees to convert 
inslaws chapter 11 reorganization into a chapter 7 liquidation 
bason found stantons testimony utterly incredible and unworthy 
of belief 
the judge also refused to believe the recantation of deposition 
testimony by former us trustee cornelius blackshear that stanton 
had asked him to help liquidate inslaw 
blackshear now a federal bankruptcy judge in new york city 
signed an affidavit recanting the sworn statements a day after he 
gave the deposition in his chambers he said he had confused the 
inslaw case with another bankruptcy matter 
the senate permanent investigations subcommittee however has 
decided to conduct a full investigation of inslaws charges that it 
was the victim of a vendetta by justice department officials to put 
it out of business 
the panels chairman sen sam nunn dga decided last week to 
conduct the investigation based on information compiled in a 
preliminary inquiry according to congressional sources who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
bason ruled last year that the justice department vendetta was 
spearheaded by an official who administered inslaws contract the 
judge found that c madison brewer was consumed by hatred and an 
intense desire for revenge because he had been fired by inslaw 
before going to work at the justice department 
stanton agreed to help brewer liquidate inslaw to curry 
favor with higher justice department officials whose support he 
needed to preserve the trustees office bason said

secularized nation in latin america apart from cuba uruguay has 
permitted divorce and enforced separation of church and state since 
1917 
church leaders say 80 percent of uruguayans are roman catholic

a french spy convicted in the sinking of the 
greenpeace ship rainbow warrior and the death of a photographer on 
board was freed from her island exile friday because she is 
pregnant premier jacques chirac said 
capt dominique prieurs departure from hao a french military 
base came about five months after the other agent convicted in the 
incident maj alain mafart was returned to paris mafart had 
complained of a stomach ailment 
mrs prieurs release also came two days before a presidential 
election that pits chirac a conservative against francois 
mitterrand the socialist incumbent and heavy favorite 
the newspaper le monde said you cant make us believe that 
the captains condition demands that her situation be arranged 48 
hours before the elections 
destruction of the protest ship in july 1985 at its berth in 
auckland new zealand was a fiasco for the french secret service 
it was a dark hour for the mitterrand administration but the 
agents who pleaded guilty to manslaughter were heroes at home 
defense minister andre giraud greeted mrs prieur and her 
husband joel when they arrived late friday night at villacoublay 
military airport near paris the couple left without making any 
comment to reporters prieur a defense department employee was 
posted to hao after his wife was exiled there 
mrs prieur 38 and mafart 37 were arrested after explosives 
attached to the hull sank the rainbow warrior which was preparing 
to sail to the french nuclear test site in the south pacific a 
greenpeace photographer was killed 
they were sentenced to 10 years each in a new zealand prison but 
under an accord reached by the united nations in 1986 were to 
remain on hao for three years 
prime minister david lange of new zealand said freeing mrs 
prieur is a breach of frances obligation under international 
law 
chirac told a campaign luncheon in agen mrs prieur is now 
pregnant and the accord foresaw that in this circumstance she 
should be returned to paris i respect my signature when i 
sign an accord it should be known that i respect it 
a foreign ministry spokeswoman said an illness in mrs prieurs 
family accelerated the release 
louis maire mrs prieurs father is hospitalized with an 
unspecified illness he told monte carlo radio he had not known of 
his daughters return but im very sick so it will be a pleasure 
to see her before dying 
lange said in a statement that her departure from hao is not 
consented to and he will pursue the matter with france next week 
at the united nations in new york french ambassador 
pierrelouis blanc met with secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to discuss the circumstances surrounding fridays 
repatriation 
benedicte scalabre a press attache to the french un mission 
called it just an informational meeting he refused comment on 
whether pregnancy was a condition for repatriation under the un 
agreement 
a spokesman for the french foreign ministry said the government 
learned of the pregnancy several days ago 
the new zealand government was immediately informed and at the 
same time invited to proceed with a medical examination the 
spokesman said speaking anonymously in keeping with french 
practice 
the newspaper le monde said mrs prieurs baby is expected early 
next year 
lange denounced mafarts return to france in december and on 
march 31 at new zealands request a dutch diplomat was sent to 
hao to make sure mrs prieur was still there 
the new zealand government has has tried unsuccessfully to force 
the return of mafart who has completed entrance examinations for a 
french war college since arriving in france 
chiracs announcement of mrs prieurs release came a day after 
three french hostages were freed in lebanon and 23 hostages held by 
separatists in new caledonia were rescued from a cave in a surprise 
assault by security forces 
there was speculation those events were timed to coincide with 
the french election 
the rainbow warrier bombing occurred while a socialist 
government was in power defense minister charles hernu resigned 
and the intelligence chief was dismissed but polls indicated the 
french people were less concerned about the bombing than the 
bungling of the operation

disputes over choosing bishops 
the vatican refuses to accept candidates from the 
statesponsored clergy association pacem in terris which the 
vatican does not recognize 
in the interview janku said in principle we have already 
reached agreement on criteria for the selection of bishops 
the vatican has three requirements faithfulness to the

provincial councils in the 
tamildominated northern and eastern provinces will not be elected 
until the end of the officially declared emergency in the region 
the government said friday 
president junius jayewardenes government imposed emergency rule 
in 1983 after separatists in the tamil minority began a war against 
the sinhalese majority more than 7000 people have been killed in 
the conflict 
the nomination of candidates for the purposes of elections to 
be held in the northern and eastern provinces shall not take place 
so long as the provisions of the public security ordinance are 
effective a government statement said 
elections for four of the nine provincial councils were held 
last week and jayewardenes united national party won majorities 
the other three councils are to be elected next month 
provincial councils are part of an indiansponsored peace plan 
designed to give greater autonomy to the provinces the plan also 
requires the rebels to surrender their arms in exchange for 
participation in local government but they rejected the plan and 
violence has continued 
india which has a tamil minority of 60 million has sent more 
than 50000 soldiers to disarm the militants in this island off 
indias southern coast

a tentative contract covering 66000 
chrysler corp employees in 15 states was approved by the united 
auto workers 140member national chrysler council friday and goes 
next to the rank and file 
we believe it will be ratified overwhelmingly said uaw vice 
president marc stepp head of the unions chrysler department 
the twoyear jobprotecting contract reached wednesday would 
replace a threeyear pact that runs out sept 14 in 1990 all big 
three contracts will expire together for the first time in a 
decade boosting the uaws bargaining power 
the chrysler council approved the pact after a 5hour meeting 
a provision giving full chrysler seniority to former american 
motors corp workers in 1990 was deleted by the council before it 
gave its approval gm acquired amc last year 
the contract which also covers 65000 retirees at the no 3 
automaker will be presented to union members for ratification on 
wednesday 
it is patterned on the contracts in place at ford motor co and 
general motors for the first time since 1979 when the uaw granted 
chrysler deep concessions to help rescue the automaker from near 
bankruptcy 
the contract prevents further plant closings and layoffs for any 
reason other than slow sales halves the attrition rate and 
restricts the automakers ability to transfer work to outside 
suppliers or foreign countries 
it also contains lumpsum bonuses equal to 3 percent of wages 
each year and provides profitsharing to chrysler workers for the 
first time 
it should pass the job security is there that was the most 
important issue said mike allen a union official with uaw local 
624 in syracuse ny 
stepp said the settlement and approval by the council had 
brought to an end months of bitter conflict that led the two sides 
to seek a solution by holding early contract talks theres peace 
in the valley he said 
unlike the ford and gm agreements the chrysler pact includes a 
1000 signing bonus and prevents chrysler from paying executives 
cash or stock bonuses in years when the profitsharing formula 
generates no payout for workers 
in addition it covers 1200 former amc workers still on the job 
in wisconsin after a 5500worker amc assembly plant in kenosha 
wis closes at years end

surrounded himself with supporters of deposed nicaraguan dictator 
anastasio somoza debayle 
one of the dissidents donald lacayo a legal adviser to the

the french presidential campaign drew to a close 
friday with the country euphoric about the freeing of french 
captives in lebanon and new caledonia but party loyalists arguing 
over the timing of the releases 
socialist president francois mitterrand favored to win a second 
sevenyear term in sundays runoff capped his electioneering with 
a final rally in the southern city of toulouse campaigning is 
prohibited saturday 
conservative premier jacques chirac toured the south basking in 
the release in beirut wednesday of marcel fontaine 45 marcel 
carton 62 and jeanpaul kauffmann 44 and in the freeing 
thursday of 23 french lawmen held by melanesian separatists in new 
caledonia 
the release from exile friday of a french spy convicted in the 
1985 sinking of the greenpeace ship rainbow warrior increased the 
recent dose of good news for chirac 
it wasnt clear how the hostage releases would affect chiracs 
chances in sundays runoff because polls are forbidden in the 
final week of the campaign most political analysts felt any 
benefits would be insufficient to overcome the wide lead held by 
mitterrand in the final opinion surveys last week 
the last polls indicated mitterrand was favored by 53 percent to 
57 percent of voters compared to chiracs 43 percent to 47 percent 
rating the men advanced to the runoff by being the top two 
votegetters in the first round of voting april 24 
in that vote mitterrand won 341 percent of the vote and chirac 
won 199 percent 
attempts to keep partisan presidential politics out of the 
celebration of the hostage releases lasted less than a day 
lionel jospin first secretary of the socialist party claimed 
chirac pushed for the releases to bolster his own campaign 
jacques chirac and his team is working public opinion with force 
in a formidable attempt to manipulate the end of the campaign he 
said friday 
but jacques toubon secretarygeneral of chiracs rally for the 
republic party denounced what he called the wet blankets the 
grumblers who split hairs when they should simply be happy 
an objective fact with the government of jacques chirac when 
there are hostages they are freed he added for order 
liberty and security jacques chirac and his government are very 
effective 
in paris central place de la concorde 40000 chirac backers 
gathered for a final outpouring of support 
we have 36 hours left to convinced the undecided interior 
minister charles pasqua told the crowd 
france needs a president who decides he said when it was 
necessary to decide for the liberation of hostages in lebanon 
chirac knew how to decide when it was necessary to decide to free 
the hostages in new caledonia chirac knew how to decide 
chirac rejected allegations that his actions were motivated by 
the elections he said it was my duty to do everything possible 
even if it could lead to critical comments to get the last 
french hostages out of lebanon 
mitterrand himself welcomed the hostage releases and made no 
insinuations about his opponent 
on thursday morning french security forces stormed a cave in 
the french island territory of new caledonia freeing 23 hostages 
two assault team members and 19 melanesian separatist kidnappers 
were killed 
on friday the government announced that capt dominique prieur 
one of two french agents convicted in new zealand of the 1985 
bombing of an antinuclear greenpeace ship had been allowed to 
leave her island exile for france chirac said she was freed 
because she is pregnant 
she and the other agent who has already returned to france 
were convicted of manslaughter a photographer aboard the rainbow 
warrier had been killed 
the leftleaning newspaper le monde questioned the coincidence 
of the release of the hostages in lebanon four days before the 
election 
would it be dignified and honorable under these conditions to 
accept that the terrorists interfere in french political life that 
they influence in one way or another the french peoples choice of 
a president 
the newspaper also questioned the assault on the new caledonian 
island of ouvea 
if these events leave a bitter taste it is because it is 
difficult to resist the idea that someone was trying to get votes 
in metropolitan france with blood in ouvea it is difficult to 
resist the idea that in 48 hours mr chirac wanted to play 
presidential poker the paper said 
le monde said it was difficult to believe that mrs prieurs 
condition required that she be repatriated just 48 hours before the 
election

the reagan administration is 
misinforming the american public about efforts to resolve panamas 
political crisis gen manuel antonio noriega said in an interview 
friday 
noriega commander of panamas defense forces and the power 
behind the civilian government has resisted us pressure 
including economic sanctions to resign 
he said that elliott abrams assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs is damaging the reagan administration 
and misinforming the us public about any talks to resolve the 
dispute 
the general said he has held conversations not 
negotiations with southern and northern leaders and spoke 
of what he called a positive proposal submitted by president 
vinicio cerezo of guatemala but he declined to give any details 
about that proposal 
noriega agreed to the interview after he inaugurated a water 
line to the community of sajalices 45 miles southwest of panama 
city 
he said panama wanted a democracy in the image and likeness of 
panama and not of the united states leave us alone let them not 
interfere with our tamoborito a panamanian folk dance and we will 
not interfere with their political rock and roll 
the reagan administration wants docile governments in latin 
america instead of friendly ones that can be treated as equals he 
added 
noriega was indicted by a federal grand jury in florida last 
february on drugtrafficking charges which he denies 
the us government imposed sanctions to force noriega to resign 
and leave panama after the legislature controlled by the general 
ousted president eric arturo delvalle feb 26 that was the day 
after delvalle tried to fire noriega 
banners in sajalices read welcome general and noriega shook 
hands and chatted with people at the ceremony inaugurating the 
threemile pipeline 
noriega opened the water faucets at a soccer field and then 
cupping his hands threw water at those around him he kicked a 
soccer ball to open an amateur leagues season and spent nearly an 
hour talking with residents 
he claimed abrams is disinforming the people of the united 
states about conversations with panama because abrams previous 
advice to president reagan has been a failure 
he said he has not refused to talk with us repesentatives 
but there are no negotiations he said we do not 
negotiate the dignity of a country and do not negotiate the dignity 
of a man 
in recent days there had been reports in washington that an 
agreement has been reached that would have noriega resign as chief 
of the 15000member defense forces but remain in panama 
noriega has denied there is such an agreement

newspapers will survive and flourish if they 
keep pace with the nations changing lifestyles and growing 
minority population industry leaders said friday 
doomsaying for newspapers is an old pastime and it has been 
booming in recent years said larry jinks senior vice president 
for news and operations at knightridder inc we are as an 
industry more cleareyed about our problems and advantages and 
more determined to do whats necessary to flourish 
the future of newspapers is very bright so long as we dont 
take that future for granted agreed sam s mckeel chairman of 
philadelphia newspapers inc which publishes the philadelphia 
inquirer and the philadelphia daily news both are knightridder 
papers 
jinks mckeel and others spoke at a conference held by columbia 
universitys graduate school of journalism which is celebrating 
its 75th anniversary 
jinks said during a panel discussion on the future of newspapers 
that industry concerns include competition illiteracy a transient 
population and a dwindling attention span among those raised in 
front of the tube 
its been the change in social patterns leisure time 
working women changes in family structure that probably have 
caused more changes in newspapers than technology has added 
anthony j marro editor and senior vice president of newsday 
mark c miller associate editor of the berkshire eagle in 
massachusetts said afternoon papers are giving way to morning 
editions because readers dont have time to sit down at the end of 
the day 
most households have a couple of people who are earning their 
living outside the home he noted were competing with all 
sorts of leisure time activities cable satellites vcrs people 
jogging around with things stuck in their ears 
dorothy gilliam a washington post columnist cited figures 
showing that minorities will account for 25 percent to 40 percent 
of the population by the turn of the century 
it seems to me what is too often missing in newspapers is the 
authentic voice of the different groups that make up our society 
today and that will increasingly comprise our society in the 
future she said 
jinks agreed saying you cant have a bunch of middleaged 
white males sit around in a news conference and decide what to put 
in tomorrows newspaper and have a newspaper thats going to appeal 
to the whole general population 
more than half the nations newspapers have allwhite reporting 
staffs and nonwhites account for only 5 percent of the 
decisionmakers at newspapers gilliam said 
that shows the industry has fallen short the american society of 
newspaper editors goal of a minority representation that reflects 
the population she said 
marro said newspapers one day may stop offering stock tables 
sports agate movie timetables or classified advertising 
information that might be obtained on home computers 
that he said could leave more space for indepth reporting a 
trend he would welcome 
i expect therell be one i suspect that most of them will 
still land on a front porch with a thump but maybe not quite as 
heavy a thump he said

canada suspended talks with france on their 
fishing war friday the day after a newfoundland trawler was 
stopped at sea and taken to a port on the frenchheld islands of 
st pierre and miquelon 
foreign secretary joe clark summoned french ambassador philippe 
husson and made a formal protest of what john crosbie minister of 
international trade described in parliament as a provocation by 
france 
in st pierre charges of illegal fishing were filed against the 
trawler maritimer and its five crewmen were released after the 
canadian government posted bail of 35000 28350 us 
opposition parties demanded that prime minister brian mulroneys 
conservative government suspend negotiations with france for the 
purchases of 10 nuclearpowered submarines and 34 european airbus 
jetliners 
clark said they wanted to start a casual trade war and 
there is no reason at this stage for us to contemplate that 
he called the trawlers interception by a french naval tug a 
bizarre incident that could be resolved diplomatically 
mulroney speaking to reporters in new brunswick promised 
vigorous action if the rights of canadian citizens were 
violated 
french officials said the vessel was escorted into port not 
arrested and the crew spent thursday night at a hotel 
in newfoundland provincial premier brian peckford accused 
france of infringing on canadian sovereignty his government 
canceled a 729000 us offshore oil contract with a french 
company and withdrew from a paris food show scheduled for next fall 
clark said he had ordered talks suspended in the fishing 
dispute a canadian negotiator had been scheduled to meet his 
counterpart in paris on friday for discussions of fishing quotas in 
the waters around st pierre and miquelon which are 10 miles south 
of newfoundland 
canada and france disagree over the international boundary of 
the islands and quotas for cod and other fish in nearby waters 
france claims a 200mile economic zone but canada recognizes only a 
12mile limit around the islands 
a french trawler the croix de lorraine was arrested last month 
when it deliberately penetrated canadian inshore waters to protest 
fishing restrictions all 21 men aboard including four french 
politicians were jailed in st johns newfoundland until the 
french government bailed them out

lebanon on friday asked the security 
council to condemn israel for sending thousands of troops backed by 
tanks and helicopter gunships into its territory earlier this week 
it is no longer permissible that lebanon and its people should 
remain at the mercy at the whim of israels politicians or 
their expansionist ambitions lebanese ambassador rachid fakhoury 
told the council 
such an operation cannot be merely an incursion fakhoury 
said indeed it was an invasion 
fakhoury said lebanon wants the council to condemn the raid 
demand that israel withdraw and take steps to prevent further 
israeli aggression 
israeli ambassador johanan bein told the council his country 
thrust into lebanon to protect itself he said years of civil war 
have left lebanon unable to curb the warring arab factions that use 
its territory to attack israel 
israels only interest and purpose in this operation was to 
defend and ensure the peace and security of its villages and 
towns bein said 
the real threats to lebanon he said are the 35000 syrian 
troops in that country iranianbacked hezbollah guerrillas who 
want to set up a radical islamic state and feuding factions of the 
palestine liberation organization 
two palestinian factions battled in beirut slums on friday 
leaving at least 28 people dead and 90 wounded said police in the 
lebanese capital 
according to fakhoury about 800 israeli troops were still in 
southern lebanon on thursday bein said israel had withdrawn all of 
its troops wednesday two days after the raid was launched 
israeli officials said their operation was aimed at palestinian 
guerrillas but it turned into a battle with hezbollah guerrillas 
in maydoun a village in southern lebanon 
fakhoury said 3000 israeli troops and their lebanese christian 
militia allies destroyed homes orchards and crops and left at 
least 500 families homeless including the population of maydoun 
bein said hezbollah had evicted all the civilians from maydoun a 
year ago and turned it into a fortified guerrilla base during 
the action utmost caution was taken to avoid civilian 
casualties he said 
israel invaded lebanon in 1982 and withdrew most of its 
occupation forces in 1985 but maintains a sixto10 mile 
selfdeclared security zone in southern lebanon as a buffer against 
terrorist raids 
the council is scheduled to resume debate monday

the parliament of the republic of 
slovenia instructed its deputies in the federal parliament on 
friday to try to unseat the yugoslav government the state news 
agency tanjug reported 
the issue will be decided may 1415 when a progress report on 
the government of premier branko mikulic will be discussed in the 
parliament 
the slovenian parliament is instructing its delegation in the 
council of republics and provinces of the parliament of 
yugoslavia not to accept the report of the federal executive

raise the issue of confidence in the federal government tanjug

not helped improve the economic situation of the country tanjug

as the source of a majority of laws and steps of economic 
policy and its implementer the federal executive council 
government is responsible

effect april 1 
the two soldiers told the associated press they were among a 
group of sandinistas who approached about 40 contras in the town of 
el colorado about 140 miles southeast of managua

said from his hospital room in juigalpa about 65 miles east of 
managua that the contras told the soldiers that only top rebel and

physicians have broken a threeyear japanese 
moratorium on organ transplants caused by controversy over the 
definition of donors death by transferring kidneys to two 
recipients medical officials said friday 
physicians at the shinrakuen hospital in niigata 160 miles 
northwest of tokyo removed the kidneys thursday from the body of a 
braindead male donor after receiving permission from his 
relatives a hospital official said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
although japanese physicians have performed about 150 kidney 
transplants in the past thursdays operations were the first 
transplants of major organs conducted in japan since 1985 
organ transplants came to a halt that year after doctors at 
tsukuba university near tokyo were accused both of murdering a 
patient to extract his kidneys and pancreas and of injuring the 
recipient who died about one year after the operation 
in january the japan medical association opened the way again 
for transplants by deciding that the cessation of brain function is 
a sufficient criterion for death opponents of transplants have 
argued that under japanese law human life comes to an end only 
when the heart stops and all visible signs of life have disappeared 
the science council of japan backed the medical associations 
decision in february after a yearlong study by the councils 
special medical committee 
heart transplants have an even shorter history in japan the 
countrys only recorded heart transplant was conducted in 1967 by 
dr juro wada of sapporo medical college wada was later accused of 
sacrificing the life of the donor the recipient died 82 days after 
the operation

a labor leader in gdansk was ordered 
jailed friday for organizing an illegal strike and lech walesa 
stirred workers with a speech in the citys strikebound shipyard 
after a young man tried to jump from a window 
food and morale both were running low when the solidarity leader 
gave his impassioned impromptu speech to the strikers 
polands powerful roman catholic church whose mediators had 
been trying to solve strikes at gdansk and nowa huta said in an 
official statement that it regretted the governments decision to 
end the nowa huta strike 
th government took steps to toughen its antistrike laws one day 
after police crushed a 10dayold steelworkers strike at the nowa 
huta mill in southern poland 
new signs cropped up that the government of premier wojciech 
jaruzelski was broadening its counterattack against the worst wave 
of labor upheaval in poland since a 1981 military crackdown 
jaruzelski in a speech to a polish bankers group said the 
nations economic difficulties were yet again being taken 
instrumental advantage of against socialism and against our 
entire society 
he did however admit that some mechanisms of the governments 
reform program have been insufficiently effective the pap news 
agency reported 
at the lenin shipyard in gdansk hundreds of police surrounded 
the complex while 800 to 1000 strikers remained inside they are 
demanding higher wages and union rights 
walesa has been in the shipyard since wednesday 
a young striker on friday suddenly rushed to a window of the 
big secondfloor cafeteria where most of the strikers have been 
gathering smashed the glass and tried to leap out according to 
western reporters at the scene 
friends grabbed him pulled him in and took him his hands and 
face covered with blood to the nearby shipyard infirmary details 
about him were not available and witnesses could not say what 
prompted his sudden action 
walesa immediately raced to the dining hall mounted a chair and 
gave an emotional impromptu speech which had an obvious effect in 
lifting spirits 
walesa told the strikers holed up in the shipyard since monday 
you know that solidarity is also taking care of the person next 
to you 
everyone has a thousand problems because he loves his wife 
and he must stay here another left 500 zlotys 125 to his wife 
when he left suddenly he realizes she has nothing to live on 
solidarity must be big here 
reporters speaking on condition of anonymity said tension 
eased and spirits rose after the speech 
with food supplies to the shipyards stopped by police since 
thursday morning the strikers had only sauerkraut soup to share 
it seems they are going to use a different scenario than in 
nowa huta said senior polish dissident adam michnik they 
probably want to take the shipyard by hunger 
also friday a gdansk court sentenced a union leader who called 
the lenin shipyard strike on monday to three months in prison 
bogdan lis the head of the gdansk region of the outlawed trade 
union federation solidarity was convicted of calling an illegal 
strike 
at least five other solidarity activists were detained friday 
said zbigniew romaszewski a solidarity spokesman in warsaw who 
keeps tracks of arrests nationwide 
the government drafted a bill that would punish organizers of 
strikes and protests with prison sentences of up to one year 
the draft obtained by western news agencies in warsaw also 
would suspend the already limited right to strike by officially 
recognized trade unions 
at the nowa huta steelworks in krakow where police staged a 
lightning raid with deafening percussion grenades thursday while 
strikers slept sullen workers emerged after their shifts ended and 
refused to talk with reporters some murmured that all was normal 
in the plant 
we express deep sorrow that an attempt of dialogue and social 
conciliation did not bring the expected results the roman 
catholic church secretariat said this does not serve the welfare 
of society or the country 
with outrage we protest the use of force against striking 
workers and students we think that the use of force leads to the 
worst possible social effects said a statement by aleksander 
koj rector at the jagiellonian university in krakow a staterun 
university 
a local solidarity leader stanislaw wadolowski said the threat 
of force ended a oneday strike by bus drivers in the northwestern 
city of szczecin he said riot police were put into position 
outside bus yards thursday six strikers were briefly detained and 
the strike ended after 10 hours 
wage demands triggered by 42 percent inflation this year have 
prompted at least five strikes since april 25 and the government 
confirmed this week it would seek additional economic powers to 
accelerate its program to reform the economy 
the government has said the strikes could derail the reform 
plans by making wages rise faster than prices plans call for 
higher and more realistic prices smaller government subsidies and 
improved conditions for managers and private enterprise 
solidarity generally favors the reforms but a statement by 
walesa friday from inside the shipyard said that society must be 
the coauthor and partner in the solutions

vice president george bush characterized 
jesse jackson as a hustler from chicago on friday during a day 
in which he said he was troubled by some of the allegations 
against attorney general edwin meese iii 
bushs remarks about jackson came on the way home from three 
days of campaigning in the west 
addressing a republican dinner at the university of nebraska 
bush said its a pleasure to be here and ill be back and im 
not going to be outhustled by the hustler from chicago or from 
that traditional liberal democrat from massachusetts 
it was a clear reference to the two remaining democratic 
candidates jackson who has a home in chicago and massachusetts 
gov michael dukakis the frontrunner 
while bush has called dukakis a traditional liberal democrat 
before his hustler remark was the first time he has described 
jackson in such terms 
bush spokesman stephen hart said the vice president was 
talking about how hard he jackson has hustled it was nothing 
derogatory 
earlier bush said that comments by two senior campaign aides 
suggesting meese was a campaign liability had not been authorized 
by him at the same time he said he was troubled by some of the 
allegations against meese 
the vice president said that my position on meese is that the 
system is working the investigation is going on and cant be 
enhanced by my finetuning or criticizing 
bushs comments in a session with reporters came after his 
communications director peter teeley and robert teeter a senior 
campaign adviser were quoted as saying that meese has become a 
liability in bushs campaign for the presidency 
i havent authorized anything now i have to get on the phone 
and find out what they said bush told reporters earlier in twin 
falls idaho 
in billings mont bush said that he had talked to the aides 
but declined to characterize his conversation a campaign source 
who spoke only on condition of anonymity said bush was angry when 
he talked with teeley 
of meese bush said in billings i know him well favorably 
but i must say i am troubled by some of the allegations i think 
fair play dictates that the system go forward and make the 
determination 
asked if meese had become an albatross on his campaign bush 
said an albatross i dont think so 
bush added that the independent counsel investigating the 
attorney generals legal difficulties was due to release a report 
soon and said well see what it says its only a matter of a 
few days away 
the detroit news in a story published friday said teeley and 
teeter made their comments in interviews this week in washington 
meese is a liability teeley was quoted as saying 
all things considered you would rather not have that problem 
going on right now teeter said referring to the independent 
counsels investigation of meese 
in comments on other subjects 
the vice president called on the government of poland to 
negotiate with striking workers and to include the outlawed labor 
union solidarity in talks to end violence there 
campaigning for farmarea support bush attacked democratic 
frontrunner dukakis for advocating a greater federal role in 
control of western water rights 
were going to have a lively debate in the fall bush said 
he was wrong and i was right 
talking with a group of farmers in a barn in idaho with a sleet 
storm howling outside bush said water allocation for irrigation 
should remain under state control 
he also promised to keep sugar quotas and other government farm 
trade supports in place despite the reagan administrations desire 
for an eventual elimination of all farm subsidies and quotas 
worldwide 
bush said the quotas should be maintained at least until other 
countries eliminate their own farm subsidies 
in billings bush continued with his agricultural theme telling 
an airport rally there will be no more grain embargoes against 
the soviet union or anyone else we are not going to use food as a 
political weapon 
former president carters grain embargo in response to the 
sending of soviet troops into afghanistan was unpopular in 
grainproducing states 
bush expressed surprise when told by reporters of the comments 
on meese by his two aides 
in the past bush has said the justice department should be 
above reproach but he has also said he does not want to 
prejudge meese and the legal system should be permitted to take 
its course 
ive said about all i need to say on that for awhile bush 
said on friday 
however the aides public comments that meeses legal 
difficulties have become a liability to the bush campaign reflect 
what other campaign advisers have said privately in the past 
campaign aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity have 
said that bush would be relieved if meese would resign because the 
situation had become an embarrassment for the campaign 
the same sources said bush had not urged meese to resign nor 
advocated such a course to the president 
on poland bush said the government there should recognize the 
reality of the solidarity movement and deal with its leaders to 
avoid further violence in that striketorn country 
i know they consider solidarity illegal but given the state 
of play there they should talk to each other and get this under 
control so people in poland will not be hurt he said 
speaking to students at the college of southern idaho bush 
heralded the 54 percent unemployment figure for april reported 
earlier in the day the lowest rate since 1974 and used it to 
mount a new attack on democrats 
when i hear the political opponents going around about pink 
slips and disaster theyre flying in the face of some 
extraordinary economic progress yes some people are still 
hurting but i want to see this recovery continue until everybody 
benefits he said 
in comments to local reporters in twin falls bush made light of 
the massachusetts miracle of economic revival that dukakis has 
trumpeted 
i think there will be plenty of things to use in our favor in 
terms of whos responsible for the massachusetts miracle he 
said i happen to think the reaganbush administration had 
something to do with that 
bush also asserted that although he expected the irancontra 
affair to be used against him in the general election im not 
worried its been tested and tried in the primary 
his involvement in the affair doesnt show up as a great 
vulnerability he has said

northern mexico a place of its own 
kind stretched along the us border has for years suffered a 
reputation as an untamed wilderness inhabited by barbarians 
even a regional dish the unique charcoalroasted beef called 
carne asada has been maligned 
where carne asada begins civilization ends 
so said jose vasconcelos the intellectual and mexican education 
minister in 192024 
his remark was often repeated by others 
but attitudes like these are starting to change thanks to 
northern mexicos newfound economic strength impressive cultural 
programs and electionyear politicking 
underlying the norths sudden popularity is a government attempt 
to strengthen national unity at a time when overall economic and 
political uncertainty troubles the entire country 
ive come to tell you that im proud to be of the north 
carlos salinas de gortari presidential candidate of the dominant 
institutional revolutionary party said on a campaign tour here 
words are converted into actions 
although born in mexico city the oftenscorned federal capital 
salinas de gortaris father was a northerner and the candidate has 
maintained strong ties to the north 
another reflection of the attitude change appeared in a recent 
issue of the national magazine el cotidiano for a long time the 
border was viewed as a place where the most corrosive elements of 
the nation took root denationalization provincialism barbarism 
unlimited reinforcement of the american way of life 
recent investigations have proven the fallacy of the 
generalized idea that border inhabitants are by definition 
pronorth american 
the north consists of the states of northern baja california 
sonora chihuahua coahuila nuevo leon and tamaulipas they are 
spread across 316000 square miles of mostly barren land that 
extends from the pacific ocean to the gulf of mexico thirteen 
million of mexicos 82 million people live there 
divided from each other by vast deserts and two sierra madre 
ranges and from the rest of mexico by hundreds of miles and 
different histories the isolated northerners have learned to rely 
on themselves 
their ties to the us southwest which was part of mexico until 
1848 are cultural and economic but their national identity and 
regional pride is strong 
the united states wants to analyze mexico according to 
american standards they think whatever is good for america has to 
be good for the rest of the world said mayor jaime bermudez of 
ciudad juarez a northern city 
but were different we think differently and we live 
differently 
out of a hostile environment northerners created strong 
regional economies that have helped sustain mexico for decades the 
mines of chihuahua and coahuila cattle ranches and agricultural 
fields of sonora industry and citrus of nuevo leon fishing and 
tourism in baja california oil shipping agriculture and border 
businesses in tamaulipas 
aptly nicknamed the sultan of the north the city of 
monterrey with 28 million people is the regions largest richest 
and most industrialized city 
nearer the border tijuana and ciudad juarez vying to become 
second largest with a little over a million people each are the 
two most dynamic cities in the area today this is due largely to 
investments in the maquiladora industry foreignowned assembly 
operations that produce goods at mexicos lower wages for export 
mostly to the united states 
when the economic crisis began in 1982 this zone suffered 
serious and profound uncertainty said the outgoing president 
miguel de la madrid during his most recent tour of border cities 
but with new development plans during these past few years 
the northern border has become one of the most dynamic zones in the 
country from the economic point of view 
as did previous presidents de la madrid has pumped hundreds of 
millions of pesos into the north much of it for sewers roads 
electricity water and other necessities 
but government funding has been targeted in recent years for 
cultural centers museums libraries and city beautification 
projects like parks and plazas 
the emphasis on northern cultural development which started 
about five years ago stemmed from a mistaken belief in mexico city 
that the border states needed to be rescued from a us cultural 
invasion said jorge bustamante director of the tijuanabased 
northern border college 
nevertheless such cultural programs as a firstever arts 
festival in sonora last year forums on border issues and a new 
magazine called cultura norte are giving northerners opportunities 
to express their unique art forms

and inevitably the uncultured provincial hicks tag is 
fading away while regional pride is strengthened 
weve always resented the fact that the north was paying taxes 
and everything went to mexico city said mayor bermudez 
but now the government sees the monster it created in mexico 
city it has finally realized that we are producing things and 
its investing here meanwhile northern mexicos maquiladora 
industry is becoming more and more crucial to national efforts to 
ride out the severe economic crisis that has plagued the country 
for six years 
shunned as secondclass operations when they started in the 
mid1960s the maquiladoras now vie with tourism as the no 2 
source of foreign income for mexico after oil 
more than 330000 people worked in 1400 maquildaoras last year 
while the industry brought in more than 14 billion in revenues 
and new plants are opening up throughout the north 
nowadays the opportunities are more in the north this is the 
land of opportunity said jorge juarez manager of a maquiladora 
in ciudad juarez 
one result has been higher education levels and incomes in the 
north than national averages uemployment generally is lower 
still northern mexico has problems 
inflation and the cost of living in the largely dollarbased 
societies usually run higher than the national average up to 25 
percent higher right on the border 
the north is a new frontier for people fleeing the chaos caused 
by overpopulation pollution and earth tremors of mexico city the 
poverty of mexicos indigenous south and the boredom of life on 
sparse communal farms 
its a way station for illegal immigrants on their way to the 
united states and the drain on limited public services is showing 
crime and drug addiction are rising housing is in short supply 
in the cities farmers are clamoring for increases in the 
guaranteed prices for their products 
even with that however northern mexico still gains new 
respect not only because of its increasing economic power but also 
because of candidate salinas de gortaris emphasis on his northern 
heritage and what his party calls his northern qualities 
northerners always have had to fend for themselves said 
romeo flores caballero a federal congressman from nuevo leon 
where salinas de gortaris father was born that produced a 
independent breed of people known for their sincerity work ethics 
and frankness 
salinas de gortari definitely has those qualities 
northern mexico however is a stronghold of the opposition 
national action party and its presidential candidate is wooing 
voters with a promise of cleaning up corruption long a sore spot 
with northerners 
meanwhile the third major presidential candidate cuauhtemoc 
cardenas has drawn huge crowds in the north specifically in 
coahuilas laguna region 
farmers there remember cardenas father the late president 
lazaro cardenas for his agrarian reform program that gave them 
land 
while other mexicans are looking northward with new respect 
these days northerners are looking southward mindful of the 
distant past 
hector manuel gallego the rector of the university of baja 
california alluded to that in his book northern mexico 
historical vision of the border 
if the abrupt mountains and the sizzling deserts have 
separated those in the different regions of the border the 
knowledge of a shared past brings us together he wrote 
what geography has separated history unites

fred de cordova says anyone familiar with his 
18 years as executive producer of nbcs tonight show would know 
his autobiography would not be a johnny dearest 
johnny came lately is a tellall book about tonight show 
host johnny carson except as de cordova tells it carson is a 
nice guy and hes enjoyed every minute of their association 
i believe that when youve known someone as long as ive known 
johnny he said and your reactions are almost identical as to 
whats acceptable theres no fear this would be a johnny 
dearest some people say i go lightly on johnny but ive never 
harbored any differences 
the book mommie dearest was a scathing account of life with 
actress joan crawford by her adopted daughter christina crawford 
im a great fan de cordova said so it wasnt likely that 
i would say johnny is a star but not a nice guy weve had our 
differences as anyone would over 18 years but weve never carried 
anything over to the next day 
de cordova twice booked himself as a guest on the show to talk 
about his new book and twice bumped himself before the writers 
strike shut down the show 
the tonight show returns wednesday night with carson 
writing his own monologues and introductions de cordova said one 
of the first things he will do is reschedule himself as a guest 
the title to the book was picked by de cordovas wife janet 
because the association with johnny carson came late in de 
cordovas career when he was already 60 
carson has been host of the latenight show 25 years i cant 
imagine when johnny will say hes had enough and i dont think 
its in the near future de cordova said but i cant think of 
anything else that would be as interesting and as much fun as this 
its the best job in television 
he said he and carson work closely on the show discussing 
guests and what they will do each night he cares he said 
he does not phone it in he works very hard and he wants everyone 
else to work as hard as he does 
de cordova does speak out on other personalities 
jack paar carsons predecessor he came back against the 
tonight show and he thought the audience might love him again i 
dont say this rudely but that was not the case he was the same 
jack paar he was 10 years ago but the audiences tastes had moved 
on 
pat sajak host of the wheel of fortune game show he had 
a letter handdelivered to johnny telling him he was going to cbs 
to do a latenight talk show scheduled to premier sometime in the 
new season johnny in his fashion wished him luck but not too 
much 
comedian joan rivers onetime regular standin for carson who 
briefly had her own latenight show on the fox broadcasting co 
network to my practiced eye it was apparent quite quickly she 
wasnt going to be strong competition to tonight when she was 
johnnys sub she was a good change of pace she did well in the 
ratings but there was heavy mail against her also and this is 
selfserving when she worked on our show she was under strict 
control we really fought her on jokes she said they went over in 
her night club act but wed tell her she was playing to johnnys 
audience 
the book published by simon amp schuster at 1795 also looks at 
de cordovas long career on the stage in movies and in television 
decordova fresh out of harvard law school got a job as a 
gofer in the theatrical offices of lee and jj shubert in new 
york in 1933 he became a stage manager then a director the last 
show he did was ziegfeld follies in 1943 with milton berle 
arthur treacher and ilona massey 
after that he signed with warner bros one of the pictures he 
directed there was bedtime for bonzo which starred ronald 
reagan and a chimpanzee he directed about 50 pictures in all 
before going into television 
he was the producer or director for burns and allen the 
jack benny show my three sons and numerous specials for 
bing crosby claudette colbert noel coward lauren bacall and many 
others 
i have managed to involve myself with people who are extremely 
pleasant to work with and who are extremely talented and that 
includes johnny carson de cordova said carson makes me happy 
to go to work and my wife makes me happy to go home

need an expert on reincarnation nuclear power 
economics sex boredom 
questions about computers atheism or weight loss have you 
stumped 
the directory of experts authorities and spokespersons 
offers to fill the void 
the 198788 directory the fourth annual edition provides in 
its 384 yellow pages an encyclopedia of sources of fact and opinion 
on subjects ranging from aids to zoological parks the sources 
range from serious experts to whimsical organizations 
subscribers to what is subtitled the talk show guest 
directory include the major tv networks magazines newspapers 
and the us bureaus of foreign publications and news agencies 
this new edition has been written from scratch after directly 
contacting tens of thousands of sources said editor mitchell p 
davis we have done the research to find 3524 experts 
authorities and spokespersons who have stated their willingness to 
be interviewed 
subjects and sources are interspersed with advertisements 
similar to the yellow pages telephone directory the book is 
published by broadcast interview source of washington 
more americans are trying nude recreation says a fullpage 
ad by the american sunbathing association in florida which is 
available for media questions regarding nudist viewpoints 
the society for the eradication of television has a cartoon 
drawing of a man kicking in a tv the battle over the future of 
tv is looming as eradicators challenge couch potatoes the ad 
says 
the couch potatoes so named because of a tendency to vegetate 
in front of the telly counter in a separate ad below with six 
arguments in support of television they include tv viewing is 
purely an american form of meditation for information call head 
spud bob armstrong in california 
the minister of information for the couch potatoes jack 
mingo of alameda calif acknowledged that his group is mostly 
tongueincheek 
but we practice what we believe or else we would be 
hypocrites dont you think mingo said 
he said the unpaid ad has brought numerous calls most of them 
come from radio stations who enjoy getting the potatoes in debate 
with the tv eradicators whom mingo described as grimly serious 
the shameless hussy press pledges to provide speakers on womens 
subjects various others offer expertise on handwriting analysis 
psychic phenomena and financial matters including one which states 
in bold letters offshore banking is not evil 
the boring institute provides commentary on politics show 
business televison films and personalities plus some good 
advice on how to avoid and overcome boredom even in sex 
we pursue those amusing ads because they interest people and 
get them to read the book its not just a reference book said 
davis who got the idea from a monthly newsletter of sources put 
out by a public relations firm for which he worked 
about 95 percent of the ads are paid he said some are offered 
for public service or for graphic interest 
one that falls in both categories is the fullpage ad with 
surprising photos of bruised bare buttocks put in by people 
opposed to paddling of students 
other advertisers in the directory use clever leadins 
totally childish conversation is promised by a cleveland 
hospital offering expert conservation on all manner of childish 
subjects neonatology birthing obstetrics pediatrics 
others are more straightforward 
school prayer cults creationism american atheists can speak 
on all of them and more 
davis said this years book contains about 180 pages of ads at 
360 a page copies distributed including free ones total 4000 
he said 
according to davis the book is popular enough to be a viable 
business 
itll be back next year in a fifth edition he said

jesse jackson has a strong desire to prove 
that he is the best michael dukakis pursues success with a fierce 
determination george bush is an ideal no 2 
gail sheehy provides these character assessments of the 
presidential candidates in her new book character americas 
search for leadership 
the book which will be published this week updates a series of 
profiles sheehy did for vanity fair magazine during the past two 
years and adds a new study president reagan 
character is more than just a factor in our evaluation of how 
we are going to vote sheehy writes in her book it affects us 
all as an essential ingredient in how we work play and deal with 
other people 
the author asked during the 1984 campaign to write a story on 
what made gary hart tick said she found a virgin 
territory of reporting on a candidates character 
i went and looked at them as human beings sheehy said in a 
telephone interview last week why wait for the biography when 
theyre out of favor out of office out of life these are early 
biographies 
at the time sheehy said there was a lot of snickering about 
this sort of softheaded approach 
its wasnt hard horserace stuff tipsters im not saying 
its more important but additional she said 
however some critics say the style of reporting is 
psychoanalyzing by a journalist and that sheehy is neither trained 
nor qualified to do it she believes she answers her critics in the 
book 
i dont pretend to be a psychoanalyst nor do i work like 
one she wrote i base my character analyses on evidence 
evidence i go out and dig up 
in discussing whether she answers the critics sheehy noted that 
she doesnt use any psychiatric terms in discussing the candidates 
i use the words of journalists and biographers those being 
insights she said insights are part of political journalism 
and literary journalism it hasnt often been done with major 
national political figures except in biographies 
her purpose she says is to mentally go beyond the facade 
created by the campaign imagemakers and the media 
here is a summary of sheehys profiles of the three remaining 
presidential candidates and reagan 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
bush has in fact the perfect resume for someone seeking 
appointive office he has always been an ideal no 2 he does what 
he is trained to do never challenges never initiates 
sheehy wrote if he reaches the white house in 1989 it will not 
be through the process of political combat and conquest but by 
polite succession to the throne 
she suggested that bush rarely gets fired up about ideas and has 
spent a lifetime avoiding confrontation despite his televised 
runin with cbs anchorman dan rather over the vice presidents role 
in the irancontra affair 
bushs baseball hero was not babe ruth but the yankees quiet 
iron horse lou gehrig sheehy notes 
in the portrait bush describes flying torpedo bombers over the 
pacific during world war ii including the morning of sept 2 1944 
when his plane was hit bush bailed out and survived in a tiny raft 
until rescued by a us submarine 
the vice president has difficulty discussing the death of his 
young daughter robin who succumbed to leukemia according to his 
wife barbara bush maintained a bedside vigil at the new york 
hospital where his daughter underwent chemotheraphy returning to 
texas every few days to manage a new oil business in midland 
but sheehy writes bush apparently cant synthesize the 
episodes of highest drama in his life and assign them meaning if 
he had been able to see his war experiences as a test of strength 
they might have allowed him to perceive himself as strong and 
manly if he had been able to find a deeper spiritual or 
philosophical message in his daughters death he might be able to 
feel good about the courage his wife says he showed

stubbornness this above all registers as the most consistent 
mark of michael dukakis character monos mou by myself if not 
his first words he admits were certainly the watchword of the 
second son born to panos and euterpe dukakis was he always 
stubborn i asked his mother always michael never gave up 
dukakis describes programming himself to grow three inches every 
year until he was 5foot11 but he stopped at 5foot8 
nevertheless in junior high school when the gym teacher said 
all the tall kids line up over here for basketball dukakis 
joined the tall kids 
dukakis the son of greek immigrants who dreamed of being 
governor even in high school succeeded through much of his life 
uppermiddleclass swarthmore harvard law school and finally 
governor of massachusetts but in 1978 he suffered his first 
failure losing his reelection bid at the age of 44 dukakis was 
forced to rethink his mistakes and his career 
i blew it he would say too managementoriented and 
politically naive 
sheehy writes dukakis accepted blame for failure just as he 
had pursued success monos mou by himself 
in january dukakis told sheehy i want to be president but 
not so badly i mean its an incredible experience for all of us 
and im running to win but if it isnt there im still going to 
be a happy guy

he is in transition indeed he seems to be in the middle of 
at least three passages at once personal political and 
historical sheehy writes 
he has lived all his life as an outsider and learned to 
capitalize on it now he is within reach of what he has always 
wanted to be accepted 
jackson as a child nicknamed bodiddley for the guitarist 
is an illegitimate son who furtively and enviously watched his 
halfbrother noah robinson jr across the street from the 
greenville sc playground

martin luther king jr when jackson said he was on the balcony and 
cradled the slain civil rights leader in his arms black leaders 
questioned his story and the whether the turtleneck sweater he wore 
was really stained with kings blood

if his father used alcohol to escape reality and his mother 
used religious devotion ronald reagan found his escape in 
daydreams sheehy writes 
since early childhood then reagan has been denying harsh 
realities and concocting his own more pleasant alternatives 
this profile previously unpublished is based on interviews 
with the presidents close advisers who requested anonymity and 
excerpts from various books written by reagan journalists and 
former white house staffer michael k deaver 
sheehy concludes that in reality reagan has been one of the 
most passive and easily manipulated presidents of this century 
the portrait traces the reagan image the control by his wife 
nancy and his loyalty to his staff including attorney general 
edwin meese iii deaver and lyn nofziger 
deaver and nofziger have been convicted of criminal charges and 
meese is the subject of a grand jury investigation 
sheehy says adult children of alcoholics often show extreme 
loyalty but of a childish kind sticking for those who are 
underserving of such loyalty 
she concludes that the reagan presidency went wrong because he 
came into office quite unable to change the american people caught 
on that his story was imaginary they discovered what ronald reagan 
had tried to hide as a kid that he lived in a world of pretend 
he didnt have a strong second act and finally he couldnt find a 
happy ending

into the fund or to redeem shares and get out 
the weekly mutual fund tables will denote noload funds with an

some funds do not charge a commission when you buy shares but do 
charge a fee if the shares are sold within a certain period a

a cold spell and an early easter curbed consumer buying last 
month and contributed to lowerthanexpected sales for the nations 
largest general retailers according to industry analysts 
april was not expected to be a strong month because many 
consumers did their easter shopping in march due to the 
earlierthanusual holiday but it was colder than usual in many 
parts of the country last month and that slowed sales of spring 
clothing and of seasonal merchandise such as gardening equipment 
and patio furniture analysts said 
the ongoing slump in consumer spending also contributed to the 
poor results which were released thursday by the nations big 
general retailers 
sales rose for some retailers but analysts deemed the gains 
lackluster 
linda kristiansen an analyst with the investment firm dean 
witter reynolds inc described spending as softer than it had 
been and predicted there would be little improvement before the 
end of 1988 
its a continuing of what weve been seeing for the last 
several months said joseph ronning an analyst with brown 
brothers harriman inc ronning predicted sales would pick up in the 
second half of the year 
economists watch retail sales closely because consumer spending 
accounts for twothirds of the gross national product 
sears roebuck and co the nations largest retailer said its 
overall sales rose 48 percent from april 1987 and 3 percent for 
the first 13 weeks of the fiscal year sales from stores open at 
least a year known as samestore sales rose 2 percent in april 
and 14 percent for the year so far 
k mart corp said its overall sales rose 25 percent last month 
and 44 percent for the year to date its samestore sales fell 06 
percent in april and rose 15 percent for the first 13 weeks 
walmart stores inc said its overall sales climbed 32 percent 
in april and 33 percent for the first three months the rapidly 
expanding chain said its samestore sales rose 12 percent last 
month and 13 percent for the year so far 
jc penney co inc which heavily emphasizes its apparel 
lines saw sales decline 04 percent last month yeartodate sales 
were up 37 percent 
limited inc another major apparel retailer said its overall 
sales fell 8 percent last month and rose 1 percent for the first 
three months of the fiscal year samestore sales fell 16 percent 
in april and 7 percent so far this year 
fashion retailers have been slumping since last fall and are not 
expected to see business turn around until this summer at the 
earliest 
the sales announced thursday were from general and apparel 
retailers and do not reflect sales of auto dealers or supermarkets 
among other retailers dayton hudson corp said its overall 
sales rose 79 percent last month and 182 percent for the first 13

the united auto workers union has brought the big 
three us automakers back under an industry pattern contract for 
the first time in a decade with this weeks settlement at chrysler 
corp 
but since the uaw first allowed chrysler to negotiate a separate 
concessionary contract in 1979 the us auto industry has changed 
and the pattern contract that is shaping its future has changed 
with it 
instead of just the big three chrysler general motors corp 
and ford motor co and american motors corp eight us and 
foreign companies build cars in the united states 
chrysler bought amc in august and volkswagen the only european 
will leave the picture later this year when it closes its 
pennsylvania assembly plant 
that leaves honda motor co toyota motor corp nissan motor 
corp and mazda motor corp all strong japanese competitors as 
importers and all promising strong futures as domestic makers 
so far the uaw represents only mazda and one of toyotas two 
us plants 
by 1990 mitsubishi motors corp fuji heavy industries the 
maker of subaru and isuzu motor co also will be building cars in 
this country 
that means although the uaw will be bargaining with the big 
three simultaneously in 1990 it must face competitive market 
realities it may have ignored before 1979 
the pattern contract is helping reshape big three labor and 
management through 1990 so the companies can survive the 
increasingly intensive competition on their home soil 
the union and the companies are riding down a rough river with 
rapids and rocks ahead in the same raft they know that if either 
kicks a hole in the bottom theyll sink together said david 
cole director of the office for the study of automotive 
transportation at the university of michigan in dearborn 
chryslers 66000worker contract must be approved today by 
leaders of its local unions before it can be presented to the rank 
and file for ratification 
the contract gives workers greater job security in turn it 
gives the automakers a chance to use workers more flexibly by 
removing national union leaders opposition to japanesestyle work 
agreements negotiated at the plant level 
furthermore while basic wage levels are the same at all three 
companies workers earnings can vary by an unprecedented amount 
from company to company because of a profitsharing formula 
the formula generated nearly 4000 a worker at ford from 1987 
profits 1500 for chrysler workers paid as a 500 bonus from a 
previous contract and a 1000 contractsigning bonus and nothing 
for gm workers 
in the past the purpose of pattern bargaining was to remove 
wages from competition essentially saying the big three could 
compete among each other on the basis of productivity and quality 
but could not compete on the basis of wage costs said harley 
shaiken labor and technology expert at the university of 
california at san diego 
now part of workers annual pay is dependent on their 
companies performance 
weve seen a tremendous increase in union emphasis on quality 
issues theyre saying if quality sells were going to support 
everything in this company that improves quality because we know 
its going to affect our compensation cole said 
increasing recognition of the interdependence between management 
and workers is key to the big three pattern but at chrysler the 
uaw took it a step farther forbidding payment of cash or stock 
executive bonuses in years when the profitsharing formula 
generates no payout for workers 
the clause largely is symbolic it doesnt affect payouts 
promised in executives contracts limit the size of bonuses 
prevent lost bonuses from being recovered in later years or 
prohibit stock options the main source of the whopping 179 
million chrysler chairman lee iacocca took home in 1987 
but cole said it is a first step toward making sure executives 
and hourly workers understand they are all playing the same 
game

when the last contract between the united 
mine workers and pittston coal group inc ran out earlier this 
year people in the southern appalachian coalfields braced for a 
potentially violent strike 
but this past weekend marked three months that some 2000 umw 
members have remained on the job with no contract at pittstons 
mines in virginia west virginia and kentucky 
there have been no bombings no sabotage no snipings and no 
strike 
instead both sides have waged corporate and public relations 
campaigns while contract talks plod along on a twodaysaweek 
circuit that alternates between norton va charleston wva and 
washington dc 
the company also has changed its tightlipped media stance of 
the past in favor of an unprecedented openness that has been dubbed 
coalfield glasnost in reference to the soviet unions new 
selfstated policy of openness 
neither side seems able to predict where this new type of labor 
battle will lead in an industry where just a few years ago union 
miners would not have worked a minute without a contract 
i think that unions are becoming more inclined to do that 
today pittston coal president gene matthis said in a recent 
interview from his lebanon va office 
the negotiations mark the first time pittston a subsidiary of 
greenwich connbased pittston co has tried to reach its own 
contract with the umw last may the company dropped out of the 
industry group that has done the bargaining on past contracts the 
bituminous coal operators association 
in february for the second straight contract the bcoa reached 
a new umw pact without a strike but pittston would not go along 
umw leaders repeatedly have accused pittston of trying to break 
the union a charge matthis denies matthis also disputes the 
suggestion that pittston may be winning the battle by keeping 
employees on the job with no contract 
i dont think that it gives us an upper hand matthis said 
we still have to hammer out an agreement 
umw officials claim pittston refuses to bargain in good faith 
but although the umw negotiating team has the authority to call 
strikes at any or all of pittstons mines it has not done so 
instead of striking the union has launched a corporate 
campaign aimed at putting pressure on pittston in the boardroom 
instead of at the mines 
this past week union members and supporters protested pittston 
twice in richmond demonstrating against the reelection of 
pittston co chairman and chief executive paul w douglas to the 
board of philip morris and then at the offices of pittston lender 
crestar bank 
the union also has demonstrated at the new york offices of chase 
manhattan bank another pittston lender and union officials have 
contacted state government officials in michigan one of pittstons 
biggest stockholders 
matthis said he has gotten no heat from the corporate campaign 
he could not say if any waves have been made with his superiors at 
the greenwich headquarters a spokesman there did not return a 
phone call 
union officials say their corporate attacks on pittston are not 
entirely new to the labor movement but they certainly are 
different from the violent strikes of the past 
during a rally in lebanon earlier this year while guitarists 
sang old labor ballads umw international president richard trumka 
lashed out at pittston in the language of the modern business 
world he blasted the parent corporation for setting up golden 
parachute severance agreements for its executives and accused 
pittston of trying to force a bad deal on miners to make its coal 
operations bear the costs of unwise acquisitions in the air freight 
business 
umw spokesman ken zinn said the union has tried to convince 
banks to let pittston know that settling with the union would be in 
its best interest 
the loan they have extended to pittston is a highrisk one 
zinn said he said the companys working capital has plummeted from 
90 million in 1984 to 21 million last year moodys investor 
service has downgraded pittstons debt rating during that time 
they lost over 133 million last year zinn said they 
havent paid a dividend to their stockholders in the last five 
years 
the union tells the banks that if pittston is struck its 
moneymaking coal operations could suffer making debt repayment 
impossible pittston has said it would operate through a strike 
zinn declined comment on whether the corporate campaign was 
working other umw officials have said they believe a strike is 
inevitable but they wont say when

a special service offered to stamp collectors 
could make it possible for late taxpayers to mail their returns 
this month and still beat the april 15 filing deadline but 
government officials say the practice is questionable 
people using the special first day of issue service can 
still get envelopes with postmarks dated in march linns stamp 
news a newspaper for collectors points out in its may 9 edition 
the way it works is that the postal service allows collectors to 
buy stamps put them on envelopes and mail the envelopes in bulk 
to the post office where the firstday ceremonies were held 
the firstday cancellations are then affixed often as much as a 
month after the event and the envelopes returned to the collector 
this is done for stamp collectors since most of them are unable 
to travel to each city where new stamps may be issued and the new 
stamps cannot be purchased in other cities until the day after 
issue 
offering the firstday cancellations for 30 days or so takes 
pressure off the issuing post office and gives collectors time to 
buy the new stamps and send them in for the cancellations 
thus a collector could put the new e stamps on an envelope 
containing tax forms send it to washington for the first day 
cancellation and it would then be delivered with the date march 22 
on the envelope 
the deadline for first day cancellations of the e stamps is 
may 21 slightly longer than normal because of the short notice 
before the stamps were put on sale 
the e stamps were issued march 22 in anticipation of new 
postage rates which took effect april 3 
technically then a taxpayer could still send in the forms on 
time under court decisions that have held a postmark is evidence 
of filing 
but dick rustin manager of the post offices stamp information 
branch says cancellations for the first day of issue look 
different and are treated differently from regulardate 
cancellations affixed to mail 
regular cancellations do confirm the date something was mailed 
he said but for those which state first day of issue he 
said we would not verify that the mail entered the system on 
that day 
generally collectors send in envelopes addressed to themselves 
for these cancellations he said 
rustin said postal officials might raise a question and contact 
a collector if it appeared obvious that their intent in getting 
the special cancellation was to defraud but he added were not 
a police state either 
tax forms arriving a month late with a march 22 cancellation 
might also raise questions at the irs said spokeswoman johnell

a federal judge has dismissed the claims of some 
of the bondholders suing the washington public power supply system 
over the scrapping of two nuclear plants 
judge william browning at a pretrial hearing in seattle 
thursday granted a defense motion ruling out the damage claims of 
people who bought bonds used to finance the plants nos 4 and 5 
but who bought them after the projects were stopped in early 1982 
browning appeared to reverse an earlier decision in which he 
included bondholders who had bought bonds for the plants between 
jan 22 1983 when the projects were terminated and june 15 
1983 when the washington supreme court invalidated the agreements 
under which the projects were financed 
it was not immediately clear how many of the approximately 
35000 bondholders in the suit were removed by the ruling clearing 
up an energy and utility newsletter published in seattle last 
september placed the number of posttermination bondholders at 
4800 
the ruling pleased defense attorneys who maintained that after 
wppss terminated plants 4 and 5 bond buyers should have been aware 
wppss was having difficulties 
the suit alleges wppss underwriters and others misled bond 
investors by withholding information about wppss financial 
problems and alleged mismanagement of the projects 
but after the projects were scrapped the bond market was 
aware of the matters that the plaintiffs were claiming had been 
concealed said david jurca attorney for a group of utilities 
arthur hoffer a hauppauge ny resident who chairs a national 
committee of wppss bondholders said the judge should have kept 
bondholders in the case based on how much each knew about wppss 
problems when they invested 
the washington public power supply system headquartered in 
richland attempted to build five nuclear power plants in the 1970s 
to serve northwest customers of those one plant wppss no 2 at 
the hanford nuclear reservation is operating 
two others wppss no 1 at hanford and no 3 at satsop west of 
olympia were mothballed while still unfinished in the early 1980s 
wppss terminated its other two plants no 4 at hanford and no 
5 at satsop in 1982 after 225 billion had been invested 
termination of the plants eventually resulted in default on the 
225 billion in bonds sold to finance the construction of wppss 
nos 4 and 5 it was the biggest default in the history of the 
municipal bond market 
most of the litigation has been consolidated in one case that is 
set to go to trial on sept 1 in tucson ariz if an outofcourt 
settlement cannot be reached

a federal judge will hear a texaco 
inc lawsuit against carl c icahn by june 3 four days before the 
oil giants annual meeting at which icahn has threatened to stage a 
fight for five board seats 
but attorneys for both sides said thursday they hope to have the 
suit resolved before then 
texaco has sued the takeover specialist over alleged violations 
of federal securities laws among other things the lawsuit seeks 
to void a slate of directors that icahn its largest shareholder is 
seeking to elect to the companys 14member board at texacos june 
7 meeting in tulsa okla 
icahn who owns 148 percent of texacos stock has maintained 
that the company was badly run and should be restructured or sold 
he has offered to withdraw his slate if the company puts itself up 
for sale at at least 55 per share texacos management refuses to 
to do that 
his lead lawyer raymond falls told us district judge geard 
goettel that the two sides would file prehearing materials by may 
27 
goettel set a hearing for june 3 but said the hearing could 
occur as early as may 31 
texacos suit filed tuesday charged that icahn his associates 
and companies he controls used deceptive and manipulative means 
to either force the company to pay greenmail force its sale to a 
third party or to acquire it in order to break it up and sell the 
pieces in each case thereby obtaining vast profits for 
themselves in disregard of federal law and the longterm interest 
of the shareholders 
greenmail refers to a transaction whereby a target company buys 
back its stock held by an unwanted suitor at a premium price not 
available to all shareholders 
texaco filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of 
the federal bankruptcy code a year ago it emerged last month and 
has launched a restructuring plan that includes the sale of 5 
billion in assets 
the bankruptcy was brought on by a 1985 houston jury ruling that 
it had improperly interfered with a pennzoil co acquisition of 
part of getty oil co then bought getty itself 
the jury awarded pennzoil 1053 billion an amount that had 
been reduced through court action to 103 billion when texaco 
filed for chapter 11 protection on april 12 1987 
dennis odea the attorney who represented the shareholders 
committee during the oil companys chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings said the committee was caught in the middle of the 
litigation 
another attorney stanley bernstein told goettel that he was 
representing a class of shareholders who planned to sue icahn 
charging that icahn manipulated stock prices when he bought shares 
from bernsteins clients 
bernstein said the suit would be filed in the next few days 
seeking damages for shareholders who claim they did not receive 
fair prices because of icahns alleged manipulation of the market

british industrialist brian c beazer offered 
employees of koppers co unspecified job guarantees in exchange for 
a friendly merger with the cement concern 
koppers did not immediately respond to the offer made in a 
letter dated thursday beazer together with the investment bank 
shearson lehman hutton inc and a british bank has a hostile 
17billion tender offer on the table 
beazer wrote that in exchange for an immediate merger 
agreement that avoids further waste and delay we will offer 
substantial and important employment guarantees to every single 
employee other than senior management 
beazer spokeswoman lissa perlman said today from new york that 
she could not elaborate on whether beazer is offering guaranteed 
employment severance pay or some other form of compensation 
the chairman of the british construction company beazer plc said 
he was renewing an earlier invitation to negotiate which koppers 
rejected in order to quell employees fears that jobs will be cut 
after a takeover and to end further senseless and expensive 
litigation 
that litigation has resulted in federal court orders in 
pittsburgh and los angeles blocking the 60pershare tender offer 
which is set to expire may 18 unless extended 
beazer claims that as of may 4 nearly 164 million common 
shares had been tendered those shares combined with the two 
million shares the group already owns represent 657 percent of 
koppers outstanding common shares he has said 
an overwhelming majority of your shareholders wish to accept 
our offer beazer said they obviously prefer it to your 
mythical recapitalization 
koppers management has said it is studying various restructuring 
plans in order to boost stock value

us and south korean negotiators said 
friday they reached agreement on cigarette imports and made 
progress on other issues in five days of trade talks aimed at 
opening the south korean market to american goods 
local trade analysts estimated that us cigarettes could 
capture 10 percent of the south korean market as a result of the 
agreement 
a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said in 
addition to full agreement on cigarettes there was good 
progress on other issues such as agricultural products and 
intellectual property rights 
the talks were more organizational than before and the results 
were very good said the official however the agreements still 
must be approved by senior officials in each government 
the us side declined to disclose details of the talks but 
south korean officials said they agreed to allow greater american 
cigarette sales by lowering prices and ending most sales 
restrictions 
south korean officials said the prices of foreign cigarettes 
would be lowered from the present 176 per pack to 103 effective 
july 1 the prices could go down further next year after south 
korea revises its laws cutting tariffs and various excise taxes 
levied on tobacco they said 
the us government has been pressing south korea to cut its 
growing trade surplus by opening its market wider to foreign goods 
and services 
south korea opened 1 percent of its 21 billion cigarette 
market last september but us cigarette sales have remained below 
the quota 
under the agreement reached this week import quotas and sales 
restrictions on imported cigarettes will be abolished after next 
year foreign exporters will be able to set their own retail 
prices officials said 
us negotiators also sought to open the south korean market to 
54 american agricultural products but south korea agreed only to 
allow imports of avocados meat extracts most vegetable juices and 
frozen potatoes for use in french fries effective july 1 
south korea agreed to honor us intellectual property rights 
for 911 pipeline products which are patented in the united 
states but not yet sold in south korea for 10 years retroactive 
from last year the officials said 
no agreement was reached however on wine and advertising for 
which the united states sought to open the south korean market 
immediately the officials said 
south korea said it would open its wine market in 1990 one year 
ahead of schedule but proposed no specific time frame for 
advertising they said 
the talks originally scheduled to run from monday to wednesday 
were extended until friday to solve lastminute differences on 
cigarettes and other issues

april oil production by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries rose from march by a halfmillion 
barrels daily to 182 million barrels a day the international 
energy agency estimated friday 
the april figure includes a daily output of 26 million barrels 
by iraq which is not a signatory to the groups current production 
sharing program 
that meant that opecs other 12 members were pumping 156 
million barrels daily slightly above their official combined quota 
of 1506 million barrels daily 
daily production gains compared with march included 
saudi arabia 43 million barrels from 42 million barrels 
iran 22 million barrels from 21 million 
united arab emirates 13 million barrels from 12 million and 
indonesia 12 million barrels from 11 million barrels 
iraq 26 million barrels from 24 million barrels 
only kuwait lowered its daily output to 10 million barrels 
daily from 11 million barrels in march while all other 
signatories to the current output agreement held their output 
steady in april the iea said 
global oil supply during april was estimated by the agency at 
487 million barrels a day up from 485 million barrels daily in 
march 
the modest rise was led by higher opec output and a rise in 
exports by east bloc countries to 20 million barrels a day from 
18 million barrels daily the agency said 
these elements were partly offset however by a drop in daily 
output by countries in the organization for economic cooperation 
and development to 166 million barrels from 170 million barrels 
in march 
the agency said the oecd decline in part reflected the 
beginning of maintenance work on the north sea 
the iea did not release monthly consumption estimates for april 
but it said it made an upward revison of its firstquarter oecd 
demand estimates to 369 million barrels a day from 366 million 
barrels a day previously 
the revised firstquarter figure is up 17 percent from a year 
earlier and mainly reflects unusually cold weather in north 
america which boosted consumption there by about 5 percent over 
the previous year 
consumption growth in north america in the first quarter was led 
by heavy fuel oil and heating oil it said noting that gasoline 
use was also higher 
european conumption was generally lower in the first quarter 
attributable to mild winter weather consumption in the pacific 
region was up about 2 percent from the first quarter of 1987 
following the firstquarter increase in oecd demand the agency 
said it expects consumption from these countries to show a rise of 
between 1 and 15 percent for 1988 this would be higher than its 
previous estimate of 1 percent growth for the year 
the latest forecast is based on assumptions of 3 percent 
economic growth in the oecd for 1988 and enduser prices holding 
near current levels for the rest of the year 
the agency estimated that oil stocks on land in the oecd totaled 
the equivalent of 102 days of forward consumption

same or better in one year while 35 percent said they foresaw 
worse conditions

recession will occur sometime next year of that number however 
78 percent said they expected the downturn to be mild

prosecutors say they have decided to retry two 
former bank executives whose first trial on federal fraud charges 
related to the nearcollapse of continental illinois national bank 
and trust co resulted in a hung jury 
john lytle a former continental vice president and william 
patterson former head of energy lending at penn square bank of 
oklahoma will be retried on 11 counts of bank fraud said 
assistant us attorney joseph duffy 
these defendants deserve to be held accountable for their 
actions he said 
prosecutors have charged that lytle accepted kickbacks from 
patterson in exchange for buying penn square loans that violated 
continentals lending policies the kickbacks came in the form of 
nearly 600000 in unsecured personal loans extended to lytle by 
penn square prosecutors contend 
but jurors who heard the lengthy trial failed to reach a verdict 
against lytle and patterson and a mistrial was declared on tuesday 
a third defendant tulsa oil contractor jere sturgis was 
acquitted he had been accused of aiding the alleged scheme by 
purchasing oil wells from lytle at a 300 percent return in hopes of 
obtaining a continental loan 
duffy said the overwhelming majority of jurors in favor of 
convicting lytle and patterson was a factor in the decision to 
retry the case 
the fact it was 11to1 demonstrates the strength of the case 
and that we were able to convince 11 people beyond a reasonable 
doubt he said 
penn square collapsed in july 1982 under the weight of energy 
loans it could not collect in 1984 continental needed a 45 
billion government bailout to survive one of the largest runs on 
deposits in banking history

while businesses placed slightly more 
helpwanted advertisements in march than they did in february the 
volume of ads has basically remained unchanged since november a 
business information group reported friday 
the conference board said its seasonally adjusted help wanted 
advertising index rose 3 points in march to 159 
the index which measures the volume of classified advertising 
in 51 major newspapers around the nation is an indicator of 
changes in demand for labor and general business conditions 
wantad volume peaked in november 1987 at 164 and has been 
basically marking time since then said board economist kenneth 
goldstein 
the consensus of economic forecasts indicates the unemployment 
rate will inch up from 56 percent in march to 63 percent this 
summer and the latest readings on helpwanted advertising are 
certainly not consistent with that scenario he said 
also friday the labor department reported that unemployment 
fell in april to 54 percent the lowest it has been since 1974 
the conference board said advertising volume rose modestly 
around the nation in march picking up most in the pacific region 
with a 33 percent gain and least in the middle atlantic region 
with a 02 percent increase 
other regional gains were east south central 32 percent 
west north central 22 percent new england 18 percent and

the stock market posted its third straight loss 
in slow trading today faced with employment statistics that raised 
fears of tighter credit and higher interest rates 
before the market opened the labor department reported that the 
civilian unemployment rate fell to 54 percent in april from 56 
percent the month before 
wall street had been warily awaiting the figures for several 
days worrying that signs of continuing strength in the economy 
would be read as a portent of increasing upward pressure on 
inflation and interest rates 
at first the market advanced on the news apparently because 
the reported increase in nonfarm payroll employment of 174000 came 
in toward the low end of advance estimates 
but as the session passed prices headed lower while bond prices 
dropped and analysts described the job data as a likely negative 
for the inflation outlook 
hourly earnings rose a disquieting 05 percent said 
economists at merrill lynch in their initial appraisal of the 
report tight labor markets will lead to further wage gains and 
rising inflation this year

jacobs suchard sa a swiss food and confectionery 
maker raised its stake friday in the british confectioner rowntree 
plc to 299 percent the maximum allowed under british law short of 
a full takeover bid 
jacobs suchard has paid an estimated 450 million pounds or 841 
million for the rowntree shares which it has acquired gradually 
since it accumulated a 149 percent stake on april 13 it held a 
235 percent stake on wednesday 
a full jacobs suchard bid would have to top the 21 
billionpound takeover bid for rowntree launched last week by rival 
swiss foods giant nestle sa 
nestle has built up a 71 percent holding in rowntree or 154 
million of the companys 215 million shares 
london analysts said they doubted jacobs suchard would try to 
outbid nestle in a takeover battle for rowntree 
my guess is that they will use the stake as some sort of lever 
against nestle said john mozley an analyst at the brokerage 
barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
jacobs suchard could use its stake to force a higher offer from 
nestle or gain some influence over the future management of the 
company but it declined to comment on its next move 
we wont reveal our strategy a company spokesman said 
nestle wrote friday to rowntree shareholders recommending they 
accept the nestle offer nestle stressed the companys role as a 
food manufacturer in britain in an apparent effort to deflect 
mounting criticism in britain of the takeover bid 
we have the resources to help rowntree grow faster than it 
could on its own particularly in europe and the us wrote 
nestle managing director helmut maucher 
nestle said it was not worried about the possibility that a 
takeover could be referred to britains monopolies and mergers 
commission to determine if the buyout would be in the public 
interest 
we have a lot of understanding for the fact that this 
acquisition has some emotional value but there is no monopoly 
point of view that could be realistically justified said nestle 
spokesman francois perroud 
he said nestle was not likely to make a new higher offer for 
rowntree soon its a good price a fair price and there are a 
lot of people suggesting its actually too much to pay for 
rowntree he said 
rowntree spokesman gavin russell said the company has not 
directly approached the government to suggest the swiss purchases 
should be referred 
it has relied instead on british legislators who are lobbying 
the government to block the purchases he said

coleco industries inc the company 
that rocketed to superstardom with its cabbage patch kids dolls 
may need another miracle to recover from its current financial 
problems 
unless it can restructure its 335 million debt and raise 
working capital coleco could soon wind up in bankruptcy court 
seeking protection from its creditors said morton e handel who 
was named this week to replace arnold c greenberg as chairman and 
chief executive officer 
i see myself under a very tight time deadline measured in 
days or weeks in order to be able to resolve the problems 
currently facing us said handel 53 a 14year coleco veteran 
and most recently the head of finances and investor relations 
were zealously trying to find some sources of working capital 
in order to give us the opportunity to run the company and bring it 
back to the point of profitability and viability he said in an 
interview 
the company has proposed that investors who own its bonds 
exchange those securities for 6 million shares of coleco stock and 
new bonds worth 119 million 
the company is in default on the interest payments on its 335 
million in debt and has set a deadline of may 13 for the exchange 
coleco has also hired clevelandbased hallwood group inc to help 
it restructure its finances 
somebody obviously has a great sense of black humor since its 
friday the 13th david leibowitz senior vice president of 
american securities corp in new york said friday 
in an effort to cut costs coleco this week laid off 475 workers 
45 percent of its total us work force mostly at its three 
manufacturing plants in the albany ny area that left it with 
about 580 employees in the united states compared with an average 
of 2500 in 1987 
colecos other products include alf dolls big wheels plastic 
tricycles and board games such as scrabble and trivial pursuit 
industry sources say the company holds about 5 percent of the 
nations toy market 
leibowitz and other analysts said the same aggressive management 
style that helped coleco hit the jackpot with the gamble on cabbage 
patch kids dolls in 1983 helped bring on the current woes 
the dolls which were introduced in 1983 after a number of other 
toy companies rejected the product helped coleco end 1985 in its 
strongest financial condition ever with sales of 776 million and 
record earnings of 64 million 
what went wrong the company was just too aggressively run 
said paul valentine an analyst with standard amp poors corp they 
bet the ranch basically and lost they waited until it was too late 
to address their inflated costs and shore up their finances 
valentine said he didnt blame greenberg or any particular 
product line such as the toys based on the rambo movie character 
or the troubled adam home computer rather colecos woes stem from 
a financial approach common in the toy industry he said 
they didnt cut their costs quickly enough after sales of the 
cabbage patch dolls fell off sharply he said like many toy 
companies coleco had a cost structure which assumed only the 
greatest success for the companys products 
the company which became coleco industries in 1961 has faced 
tough times before it entered the snowmobile business in 1972 but 
snowfalls were light for the next three years the economy was 
depressed and losses were heavy 
the company posted a 22 million loss in 1978 threatening its 
survival in 1980 the securities and exchange commission charged 
coleco with misstating its financial results to mask troubles 
in 1982 the company began a move toward prosperity with the 
introduction of its colecovision home video game system the 
company saw its future in electronics and in 1983 unveiled its 
600 adam home computer 
adam was a monumental flop while sales of colecovision cooled 
the company lost 798 million in 1984 despite 540 million in 
sales of cabbage patch kids 
valentine said he doesnt believe coleco will have to file under 
chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code saying investors have 
appeared more willing in recent weeks to consummate the exchange 
he also predicted coleco may sell off a toy line to raise some cash 
if it can weather the current storm leibowitz said coleco has a 
strong enough product line to remain an industry leader 
this is a company that has a strong pedigree in the business 
and one is not going to write them off as a meaningful player in 
the trade he said what we are saying is the overwhelming 
consideration and the major concern right now is simply the ability 
to keep the doors open and work out an accommodation

unemployment fell in april to 54 percent the 
lowest it has been since 1974 with exportled hiring on factory 
assembly lines in the industrial heartland leading the latest spurt 
of new jobs the government said friday 
the number of americans at work rose by 606000 last month while 
those listed as unemployed fell by 191000 to 66 million dropping 
joblessness 02 percentage points from marchs rate of 56 percent 
the labor department said 
the rate was the lowest since june 1974 when it also stood at 
54 percent but at time when the nation was well into a steep 
recesssion in contrast to the current economic expansion 
one of the best barometers of the state of our economy is to 
see more people working president reagan said in reaction to 
fridays report the good news continues the economy 
continues to grow at a moderate pace and inflation is under 
control 
private analysts agreed although some of them repeated 
assertions they have been making since last september when the 
jobless rate first dipped below 6 percent that the tighter labor 
market is bound to push wages up soon and exert inflationary 
pressures on prices as well 
we have reached the zone of full employment when the jobless 
rate is so low that wage inflation starts accelerating and it 
clearly is now said allen sinai an economist for the boston 
co a new york financial consultant 
in another report adding to fears of inflation the federal 
reserve board said consumer installment debt grew by 446 billion 
in march a strong annual rate of growth of 86 percent consumer 
debt grew a 103 percent annual rate for the first three months of 
the year compared with 72 percent for all of 1987 
the labor department said in its report on the job market that 
the average hourly wage nationwide in april rose to 922 a nickel 
over march for an average annual increase of 56 percent that is 
twice the 28 percent average increase in hourly wages for all of 
1987 
other economists however said the wage gains are still not big 
enough to trigger a tightening of credit by the federal reserve 
board through higher interest rates in an effort to cool off the 
economy 
the fears of an inflationary boom are overstated said larry 
chimerine president of the wefa group of bala cynwyd pa an 
economic consulting firm i dont think it will get out of hand 
manufacturing is strong but other areas of the economy such as 
services retailing and construction are showing some weakness 
richard rahn the us chamber of commerces chief economist 
said it is a myth that low unemployment causes inflation 
the opposite is more often the case he said since 1950 
we have had 15 years when unemployment was at or below todays 
rates the average inflation rate in those years was 36 percent 
during the other 23 years when unemployment was above todays 
number inflation was a dramatic onethird higher or 48 percent 
growth in new factory jobs which had been sluggish the previous 
three months after rising dramatically in 1987 accounted for more 
than onefourth of the 175000 increase in employers payrolls in 
april 
leading the surge were exportrelated industries such as 
machinery and fabricated metal products but production jobs in the 
us auto industry also climbed by 10000 reversing widescale 
layoffs in january and february 
michigans unemployment rate dropped from 83 percent to 74 
percent as did joblessness in several other states whose economies 
are heavily dependent on manufacturing 
the rates fell from 38 percent to 35 percent in new york from 
4 percent to 35 percent in new jersey from 77 percent to 63 
percent in ohio and from 51 percent to 48 percent in pennsylvania 
and nearly all of the jobless decline in april was among adult 
men who are more likely than women to work on the goodsproducing 
side of the economy as opposed to the service sectors 
the jobless rate for adult men fell 03 percent points to 46 
percent in april for women it remained unchanged at 48 percent 
hospital and business services and retail outlets such as stores 
and restaurants which had been the hottest areas of job growth the 
past year showed a total payroll gain of just 71000 in april 
the labor department said nearly all of the improvement in the 
unemployment figures was among people who had been laid off from 
their last jobs as opposed to those who had quit or were seeking 
employment for the first time 
the number of unemployed job losers declined to slightly less 
than 3 million and their proportion of the total jobless was at its 
lowest point this decade 44 percent said janet l norwood the 
commissioner of labor statistics 
growth in voluntary parttime jobs accounted for twothirds of 
the increase in the number of working americans in april 
we often fall into the trap of reacting negatively to any job 
expansion that is not full time ms norwood told the 
congressional joint economic committee but some one out of every 
eight workers 15 million in all do not want fulltime jobs 
the number of people working parttime because they could not 
find fulltime work actually fell by 150000 last month to 52 
million still a level of concern ms norwood said

trans world airlines inc said friday its board 
has approved a sweetened offer from its chairman carl c icahn 
for the shares in the company that he does not already own 
removing one barrier in his effort to take the airline private 
the takeover specialist controls twa through eltities that own 
77 percent of its 30 million common shares outstanding he dropped 
a similar proposal after the oct 12 stock market crash then came 
back with a revised bid on april 22 
under the bid approved by twas board friday shareholders not 
affiliated with icahn would receive for each share of common stock 
20 in cash and 30 in face amount of 12 percent notes due in 2008 
those notes had carried a 29 face value in icahns april 22 
offer 
at the same time the entities controlled by icahn would 
receive for each common share 20 in cash and a new issue of 
preferred stock and a retained share of common stock a twa 
statement said 
once completed icahn and entities controlled by him would own 
about 90 percent of the airlines stock the remaining shares would 
be owned by an employee stock ownership plan 
the airline also said that upon closure of the deal it intended 
to 
pay off at least 645 million of debt 
seek the consent of holders of some preferred stock to 
eliminate voting rights on that stock and to exchange other 
preferred issues for 12 percent notes 
the transaction is subject to various conditions including 
regulatory clearance and approval by a majority vote of 
shareholders unaffiliated with icahn a vote on the proposal is to 
be conducted at twas annual meeting to be held toward the end of 
the year 
twa said an independent committee was selected by its board to 
evaluate the fairness of both of icahn proposals to the public 
shareholdeps of twas common stock 
the independent committee has determined that icahns revised 
offer is fair to the public holders of twa common stock from a 
financial point of view and will recommend that the common 
stockholders approve the transaction the statement said 
it added that the investment banking firm of dillon read amp co 
inc had told the committee orally that the icahns latest offer 
is fair to public holders from a financial point of view 
industry analysts had been generally positive about icahns 
april 22 offer putting a value on the combined package of cash and 
note at levels between 35 and 45 per outstandinf share 
that would make the offer worth at least 276 million at 40 
per share for the 69 million outstanding shares icahn does not 
already control 
the april 22 offer sent twas stock up 7 a share to 3512 
the stock rose 112 a share friday to close at 3550 on the new 
york stock exchange 
despite the response in april it appeared icahn faced pressure 
raise it anyway 
he had several conversations with the investment bankers who 
had been retained by the independent committee and maybe they 
persuaded him it should be made a little sweeter said mark 
buckstein a twa spokesman 
john pincavage who watches twa for the painewebber inc 
securities firm said friday that he had priced the april offer at 
36 to 38 a share 
so maybe this makes it 39 he said 
i think its a good deal for shareholders pincavage added 
after all icahn could have bought it on the market at a lower 
priae if he wanted to

eastern airlines sued two of its unions for 15 
billion friday accusing its pilots and machinists of eastern 
bashing to drive down the carriers value so they could buy it 
cheaply on the stock market 
in the latest of a series of court battles with labor 
miamibased eastern and parent company texas air corp allege the 
international association of machinists and the air line pilots 
association have campaigned to smear them 
the smear campaign is one of a number of tactics to facilitate 
a takeover airline attorney parker folse iii of houston said of 
the suit filed in us district court here 
also friday texas air reported a 1243 million loss for the 
first three months of 1988 on revenues of 21 billion vs a loss 
of 101 million on revenues of 2 billion for the same period a 
year ago eastern had a 31 million loss for the first quarter 
compared with net income of 21 million in the same period in 1987 
easterns alpa chairman john bavis among those named 
individually in the suit brushed it off as a company tactic to 
divert attention from a us department of transportation probe of 
the carriers finances and safety 
this is like the lions suing the christians for animal abuse 
the situation at eastern today has been called the corporate 
version of the battered child syndrome with the company being 
mugged by its own parent texas air bavis said 
machinist local president charles bryan said in atlanta that the 
lawsuit was an effort to shift public opinion which he claimed had 
been gaining momentum on the side of employees 
its clear evidence of a lastditch effort by a very desperate 
man and that mans frank lorenzo he said of texas airs owner 
the suit is a typical gesture on his lorenzos part to blame 
others for his problems bryan said 
alpa the iam and easterns transport worker union tried to buy 
the carrier before texas air bought it in 1986 for 676 million a 
sale they then tried to block the suit says the two unions still 
hope to obtain eastern which has lost 900 million in the past 10 
years 
they seek this by an allout effort to injure easterns 
business to make it a financial millstone for texas air by 
means of mail fraud wire fraud extortion further they 
have set out to destroy easterns good will and reputation the 
suit says 
the suit also said that by promoting deceitful accusations 
about the safety of eastern defendants have induced the news media 
to join in an eastern bashing effort and have led the dot and 
the faa to conduct costly investigations of the airline all of 
which have further damaged easterns business 
indeed that is the precise objective of the smear campaign 
to drain eastern of its economic vitality and to continue draining 
it until either texas air delivers the company into union hands or 
eastern is driven into bankruptcy 
if unable to obtain eastern the pilots and machinists are 
prepared to destroy both companies says the suit which notes 
the labor groups have consulted with t boone pickens on a plan to 
take over texas air for 12 billion 
the suit is baseless said john edmond a washington lawyer for 
the machinists their contract dispute with eastern which seeks 
wage cuts of up to 50 percent is in federal mediation 
the unions have long contended that texas air and lorenzo aim to 
strip eastern of its assets and bust its labor groups fridays 
suit is another example said mary jane barry president of the 
twu which represents about 7000 flight attendants and is not 
named in the suit 
alpas bavis said the suit merely aims to divert attention from 
the federal probes of eastern texas air and another of its 
subsidiaries continental airlines 
also last month the federal aviation administration announced 
it was seeking 823000 in penalties from eastern for past safety 
violations and it then began a planebyplane inspection of the 
carrier last year eastern paid a 95 million fine for violations 
the house public works and transportation committee approved a 
nonbinding resolution on thursday urging the transportation 
department parent of the faa to widen the probe of eastern and 
texas air to include how the public and workers might be affected 
by company policies

lespinasse a trader for dean witter reynolds inc 
the market was a little bit tentative but it did seem to 
favor those who tend to think there will be little less rain than a 
little more he said 
the soybean market has been particularly sensitive to 
indications of dry weather because recent government reports 
indicate a poor crop could lead to a severe tightening of supplies 
soybean planting is barely under way lespinasse said while the 
corn crop is nearly half planted

usg corp said friday it has proposed a 
settlement to lawsuits filed by shareholders who objected to parts 
of the companys plan to recapitalize in the face of a hostile 
takeover bid 
an unspecified number of suits were filed in delaware chancery 
court sometime after monday when usg unveiled details of its 22 
billion recapitalization plan the chicagobased building products 
company is incorporated in delaware 
the proposed settlement which still must be approved by the 
court would add 924 million to the cost of the recapitalization 
the investor group pursuing a 2 billion takeover bid desert 
partners lp of midland texas said in a statement it did not 
believe the settlement would be approved 
shareholders objected to aspects of the recapitalization plan 
that would dilute the value of their shares usg spokeswoman randi 
killian said 
under its initial plan usg proposed to pay shareholders 37 in 
cash debentures with a face value of 5 and a share of stock in 
the recapitalized corporation for each common share 
but each of the 22 million shares held by the companys 
employee investment plans instead were to be swapped for eight 
shares in the new company usg would have had to issue 179 million 
new shares to the investment plans which irked some shareholders 
over dilution of their holdings 
as part of its proposed settlement usg agreed the shares held 
by the employee plans would receive the same payout of cash notes 
and stock as other sharesholders rather than just straight stock 
the settlement proposal would keep the number of outstanding 
shares at 54 million down from the 70 million called for under the 
original plan 
it is now costing usg more but the shares are worth more 
because there are fewer outstanding killian said 
desert partners called the proposed settlement a thinly 
disguised public relations gesture to bolster usgs position in 
the upcoming proxy contest the two sides are building up to a 
showdown at usgs annual meeting on may 11 desert partners has 
nominated a slate of six candidates to usgs 15member board 
the partnership noted in a statement that usg is not obligated 
to go through with the terms of the settlement if it is not 
approved by the court 
desert partners a partnership headed by two texas oilmen has 
been trying to acquire usg for months the partnership has a 
42ashare tender offer outstanding that values usg at 216 
billion but has made repeated efforts to negotiate a merger at a 
higher price 
earlier this week desert partners offered to acquire usg in a 
deal wall street sources estimated would be worth 50 a share or 
about 258 billion 
desert partners headed by cyril wagner jr and jack e brown 
owns about 99 percent of usgs shares and said that as of last 
friday about 193 million shares or 375 percent had been 
tendered under its 42ashare offer

a class action suit was filed friday 
on behalf of texaco inc shareholders who claim takeover strategist 
carl icahn manipulated the price of the oil giants shares so he 
could buy them cheaply 
the suit is a companion to one filed by texaco earlier this week 
alleging massive securities law violations by icahn who is 
texacos largest shareholder and chairman of trans world airlines 
inc 
stanley bernstein an attorney who helped file the shareholder 
suit said he expected the case to be joined with the main texaco 
action at us district court in white plains texaco is 
headquartered in nearby harrison ny 
the shareholder suit claims that icahn along with associates 
and companies he controls deceived manipulated and harmed other 
texaco shareholders to advance his own interests since buying a big 
block of texaco stock last fall 
icahn was out of his office and unavailable for comment on the 
suit 
he began buying the stock while texaco was negotiating a 
settlement with rival pennzoil over a 103 billion judgment 
awarded pennzoil after a texas jury found texaco had illegally 
interfered with pennzoils merger with getty oil co 
texaco filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of 
the bankruptcy code last year and emerged last month under a 
courtapproved reorganization plan 
the shareholder suit charges icahn interfered with the 
reorganization process traded on inside information circulated 
false and misleading information and otherwise engaged in acts 
which constituted a manipulative or deceptive device prohibited 
by the federal securities laws 
such actions allowed icahn to purchase an estimated 30 million 
shares of texaco between october 1987 and may 1988 below market 
value the suit said 
the suit seeks unspecified damages on behalf of all those texaco 
shareholders who sold stock during the period oct 2 1987 and may 
3 1988 
the suit was filed in manhattan but was expected to be 
transfered to white plains 
texacos suit filed tuesday seeks to invalidate icahn attempt 
to install himself and some associates on the companys board of

texas air corp on friday reported a net loss of 
1243 million for the first quarter which the airline giant 
blamed largely on labor troubles at eastern airlines and bad winter 
weather affecting continental airlines 
texas air the nations largest airline holding company with 
about 20 percent of the market is the parent of eastern and 
continental its overall loss of 1243 million widened from a 
1007 million loss in the first three months of 1987 
the latest loss occurred despite an increase in revenue to 
213 billion from 204 billion in the yearearlier quarter 
texas air attributed the losses at miamibased eastern to a 
crippling campaign being waged by the eastern pilots and 
machinists unions against the carrier 
eastern and texas air sued the two unions friday for 15 
billion accusing them of eastern bashing to drive down the 
airlines value so they could buy it cheaply 
eastern posted a net loss of 31 million for the first quarter 
compared with net income of 21 million a year earlier revenue 
declined to 11 billion from 12 billion 
the company said houstonbased continentals losses were caused 
by bad weather and the costs of integrating the airline into the 
parent which had also been problems in late 1987 
continental recorded a firstquarter loss of 806 million on 
revenue of 11 billion narrowed from a loss of 979 million on 
revenue of 900 million 
continentals earnings for firstquarter 1987 were restated to 
include the results for people express new york air and rocky 
mountain airways which continental purchased from texas air in 
april 1987 
the losses reported by both eastern and continental are 
close to our expectations and reflect the unusual operating 
environments which each airline faces at this time texas air 
spokesman bruce hicks said 
he said continental experienced a difficult first quarter but 
ended the period on a positive and profitable note 
improving fare levels operating performances and generally 
positive traffic trends are producing a marked change in 
continentals financial performance hicks said 
at eastern aggressive cost control and the elimination of 
noneconomic services helped reduce the firstquarter loss from the 
level of losses incurred in the second half of 1987 texas air said 
texas air officials have blamed the pilots and machinists unions 
at eastern for the current investigations of both big texas air 
carriers by the department of transportation and the federal 
aviation administration 
the investigations have turned up no major safety flaws in the 
planes 
hicks said the past several weeks have been most difficult and 
challenging because of the investigations 
we strongly believe that texas air and its airlines will 
emerge from this process with renewed confirmation of our 
objectives he said

the federal government on friday charged 
ef hutton amp co inc in connection with an alleged 
moneylaundering scheme that helped organized crime figures and 
businessmen conceal at least 532000 from the internal revenue 
service 
hutton was expected to plead guilty to the three felony counts 
of conspiracy and money laundering us attorney lincoln c almond 
said 
two former hutton brokers were also named in documents known as 
a criminal information filed in us district court here one of 
the brokers stephen s fusco died shortly after the investigation 
began and almond said charges against the other brian j lareau 
46 of jamestown would be filed next week 
the charges accuse hutton of failing to report at least 532000 
in currency transactions through its providence office federal law 
requires that cash transactions of greater than 10000 must be 
reported to the irs 
the people for whom the transaction were allegedly made were not 
named in the past almond has said up to 12 million was 
involved some of it from organizedcrime figures and some from 
businessmen 
hutton was acquired last year by shearson lehman brothers inc 
and the company is now known as shearson lehman hutton inc a 
shearson spokesman michael o neill said the company would 
acquiesce to the charges 
there was an agreement reached about a month and a half ago at 
which hutton agreed to a criminal disposition oneill said the 
filing of the charges he said was the next logical step 
oneill said the charges would not interfere with huttons 
current operations its an old matter and the principals have 
long since left the firm he said 
hutton faces up to 101 million in fines 
almond called the alleged scheme a major problem existing in 
the providence office of hutton he said he did not know of any 
wrongdoing at other hutton offices 
he declined to give details of the alleged crimes on friday but 
said they would be spelled out after a court hearing on may 16 
according to the criminal information fusco allegedly accepted 
cash in amounts greater than 10000 from clients and directed 
other hutton employees to take the cash to providence banks and buy 
cashiers checks in denominations smaller than 10000 
the cashiers checks would then be deposited in the customers 
accounts and used to purchase bearer bonds which would be redeemed 
through intermediaries to conceal their true ownership the 
information charged 
almond said the investigation of hutton began in the summer of 
1985 after the probe was completed last summer the justice 
department and the company began several months of negotiations 
which led to the charges being filed 
fusco who died of cancer in late 1985 committed the more 
egregious offenses almond said lareau was an offshoot of 
that 
no other individuals will be charged in the case almond said a 
corporation can be held criminally liable for the acts of its 
employees but there was no evidence other hutton employees 
participated in the alleged crimes he said 
under securities and exchange commission rules a felony 
conviction could result in the total suspension of investment 
services 
shearson said last month it expected to receive waivers from the 
sec that would allow it to continue business 
last october the sec found that hutton had violated provisions 
of the sec law and rules relating to financial record keeping and 
reporting of currency transactions 
as a result hutton was censured and directed to report to the 
sec on policies and procedures regarding the receipt of cash 
deposits and to adopt surveillance procedures to monitor deposits 
of multiple bank checks

full chrysler seniority to former american motors corp workers in 
1990 the settlement was approved after that provision was taken 
out 
it should pass the job security is there that was the most 
important issue said mike allen a union official with uaw local 
624 in syracuse ny 
it is a good contract and will provide reasonable gains until 
1990 said thomas russell president of local 1413 in huntsville 
ala 
but russell whose plant belongs to the acustar inc parts 
subsidiary that chrysler tried unsuccessfully to sell earlier this 
year added that his temperament was altered somewhat because 
im still stinging from the proposed sale of acustar and had 
hoped the contract would keep chrysler from being able to sell the 
operation 
unlike the ford motor co and general motors corp agreements it 
was patterned on the chrysler pact also includes a 1000 signing 
bonus guarantees workers will receive a minimum of 500 in 
profitsharing for 1988 regardless of the companys performance and 
prevents chrysler from paying executives cash or stock bonuses in 
years when a profitsharing formula generates no payout for workers 
in addition it will cover 1200 former amc workers in wisconsin 
beginning 90 days after a 5500worker assembly plant in kenosha 
wis closes at years end workers at a 1000worker engine plant 
in kenosha and a 200worker parts depot in milwaukee whose 
operations will remain open will then be folded into the uaws 
chrysler family 
in order to finish negotiations chrysler and the uaw first 
settled the issue of millions of dollars that amc owed 9000 
active laidoff and retired wisconsin workers when chrysler bought 
the ailing automaker in august 
under that settlement the workers will receive an average of 
6000 to 8000 each or 57 million 100 percent of the money 
they loaned amc in concessions in 1982 but none of 8 million in 
interest amc had promised 
some delegates at fridays meeting said they werent satisfied 
with the 1000 signing bonus in part because of the size of the 
payments to amc workers 
but most indicated they expected the industrypattern pact to be 
ratified 
a particular high point was a provision that appears to prevent 
the layoff of workers at four of chryslers acustar inc parts 
plants to be closed or sold by september 1989 the four plants 
three in the detroit area and one in van wert ohio employ about 
2000 workers 
under the contract chrysler will continue paying the salaries 
of workers who otherwise would be laidoff if the plants or closed 
or sold instead of being laid off those workers would be placed 
in a job bank and allowed to move to other plants when openings 
occur 
if any of the plants are sold their workers also can choose 
whether they will stay with chrysler or go with the purchaser 
i can live with that thats what we attempted to negotiate 
said don lingar president of local 372 lingars 105worker 
acustar chemical plant in trenton is certain to be closed because 
of serious healthandsafety problems 
the contract returns chrysler to the industry pattern for the 
first time since 1979 when the uaw granted chrysler deep 
concessions to help it win federal loan guarantees that rescued the 
automaker from the verge of bankruptcy in 1990 all big three 
contracts will expire together giving the uaw a choice of any of 
the three at which to set the pattern for the others 
the pattern contract prevents further plant closings and layoffs 
for any reason other than production cuts caused by slow sales 
halves the attrition rate restricts companies ability to transfer 
work to outside suppliers or foreign countries pays lump sum 
bonuses equal to 3 percent of wages each year and provides 
profitsharing based on a companys us performance
